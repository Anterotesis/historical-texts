         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE Diſtreſſed ORPHANS Of the CITY of <hi>LONDON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Aldermen being their Guardians, and, Sworn to maintain their Rights— And having forc'd the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of about 1400 of them into their Chamber, on pain of Impriſonment— And by their prodigious Feaſtings, Preſents, and like Imbezlements of their Depoſites, becoming Indebted to them above 500000. <hi>l.</hi> — And taking up above 100000 <hi>l.</hi> at Intereſt, on pretence to pay off ſome Orphans:— And looking on themſelves to be above Law, becauſe of their vaſt Revenue:— And fearing no Proceſs, becauſe themſelves had the Iſſues which they Forfeited: <note place="margin">1684. 10. <hi>October.</hi>
               </note> — They declar'd themſelves Bankrupts,— defi'd their Creditors,— and order'd pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them but 6 <hi>d. per</hi> Pound for their reſpective Debts.</p>
            <p>The poor Orphans Petitioning the King thereupon, the Honorable Mr. <hi>Finch</hi> Reported that Order to be Unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and againſt Common Right:— And thereupon it was ordered to be Revoked, and Payment of Intereſt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till they were in Capacity to pay the Principal.— And the ſame was Revoked and Ordered accordingly.</p>
            <p>The Orphans ſoon after Petition'd the Honourable Houſe of Commons. <note place="margin">5 <hi>March.</hi>
               </note> — They order'd an account to be brought in of the City's Revenue: But by the Account deliver'd in, they had no more than 54 <hi>l. per. an.</hi> above the neceſſary Charge of their Government: <note place="margin">1685.</note> And they prevail'd to have the ſame believ'd.</p>
            <p>Diſcoveries being made that they had Eſtate enough to pay their Debts:— And that on Inſpection of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and Rentals, it ſhould be manifeſted even to themſelves:— And ſeveral of the Particulars being inſtanced in to them before Sir <hi>William Turner,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1687. 17 <hi>January.</hi>
               </note> Sir <hi>William Prichard</hi> and Sir <hi>Joſeph Herne,</hi> whom the Orphans prevailed upon to be Preſent; the Orphans thereupon began to be Importunate, and thereby obtain'd an Order for Inſpection; And that all Improvements of any Branch of their Revenue over and above the neceſſary ſupport of their Government, ſhould be applied to their Relief; And that the Diſcoverers ſhould be Recompenc'd.</p>
            <p>No Inſpection being permitted notwithſtanding:— And the Diſcoverers being Abuſed inſtead of being Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged: <note place="margin">1. <hi>March.</hi>
               </note> — And the ſaid Guardians having to the Second of <hi>May,</hi> 1685, paid out of the Cole Duty 520037 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> 2 <hi>d.</hi> but not the third part thereof according to their Truſt; and great part thereof being paid for what they ow'd and Intereſt, but no Peny thereof to the Starving Orphans. And 6996 <hi>l.</hi> 4 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> being given to thoſe who promis'd to detect the Frauds of that Duty, but never brought in 6 <hi>d.</hi> And they who ſhew'd them how to pay their Debts, were paid only with Affronts — And 149730 <hi>l.</hi> of the poor Orphans Monies being lent to the Creatures of their Guardians, and not one Penny of it got back: Many of the Orphans not being able to bear the Extremities they were reduced to for want of their Portions, made away themſelves, and others took wicked Courſes, to the Ruine of Body and Soul.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Lords Compaſſionating theſe Poor Creatures, ſent down a Bill for appointing Commiſſioners to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the City's Eſtate; <note place="margin">1690.</note> but the Aldermen oppoſing it, and promiſing to Execute it themſeves, it went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The Diſcoveries were then Proſecuted before the Committee of <hi>Common Council;</hi> and a Report was obtain'd under the Hands of Sir <hi>William Turner,</hi> Sir <hi>John Moor,</hi> Sir <hi>William Prichard,</hi> Sir <hi>Samuel Daſhwood,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Vernon,</hi> and ſeveral other worthy Citizens, <note place="margin">1691. 11. <hi>May.</hi>
               </note> that they could ſpare 8000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lords ſent down a Bill to Confirm this:— The Aldermen petition'd for it likewiſe,— but privtely Oppos'd it, and endeavoured to have the Subject Taxed to pay them 16000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> and thereby ſtopp'd it.</p>
            <p>A Noble Peer offer'd them 10000 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> for that which they made not 6 <hi>d.</hi> of, but they would not vouchſafe to refer it.</p>
            <p>To ſtop the Orphans Mouths this Seſſons, <note place="margin">1692. <hi>July.</hi>
               </note> a Petition was preſented, but the Orphans were adviſed not to appear, but leave it to the Aldermen.— They did ſo: The <hi>Houſe</hi> Order'd an Account to be brought in of their Eſtate, but they have concealed the greateſt part of it.</p>
            <p>On tne 24th Inſtant, they Petitioned their Guardians, and made them a more Advantageous Propoſal and Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by Citizens, above all Exception, to perform it; but they would not accept it.</p>
            <p>Finding themſelves thus Treated,— And ſo much of this Seſſions ſpent, they preſented a Petition of their own,— And the Houſe with great Charity, Order'd to Conſider of it this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They with all thankfulneſs acknowledge the Favour, and with moſt Humble Importunity Beſeech,</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the <hi>Quantum</hi> for the neceſſary Support of the City's Government may be aſcertain'd. And ſuch part of their Eſtate may be appropriated to it, as your great Wiſdoms ſhall think ſufficient, regard being had to their Ancient uſage of Raiſing Monys by Fifteens for all Publick Occaſions.</item>
               <item>2. That all the reſt of their Eſtate, and all the Profits which legally may be raiſed out of any of their undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rights, may be appropriated to the paying of their Debts, as your Wiſdoms ſhall appoint; and as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have ordered.</item>
               <item>3. That the ſix Years Intereſt now due may be forthwith paid, many of the Fatherleſs and Widows being in rags, and wanting Bread.</item>
               <item>4. That the Propoſals ready to be made your Honours for improving the ſaid 8000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> to a ſufficient Fund to pay 4 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> for Ever; for what the City owes may be Examined; and if your Honours approve of them, and of the Security for Performance; they may be confirmed.</item>
               <item>5. That after the ſaid Debts are paid off, or ſatisfied by virtue of the ſaid Diſcoveries, all the remainder of the Profits ariſing thereby, may be appropriated to, and for the Advantage of the ſaid City, as your Honours ſhall appoint.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That in caſe any of the ſaid Aldermen ſhall make any Oppoſition hereunto, they may be accountable for their reſpective Male-Adminiſtrations out of their own Eſtates, as other Guardians by Law, are—And that like Proceſs may be awarded againſt them, as againſt other Bankrupts—And that they may have no more of the Orphans Monys to carry on, or defend themſelves in oppreſſing the Fatherleſs and Widows, to the high diſpleaſure of their Avenger, who is Almighty: And to the Scandal, not only of this Nation, but of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanity it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Grocers Company ſoon paid their Debts, when their Hall and Rents were Sequeſtred.</p>
