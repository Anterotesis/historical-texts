            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and his Deuotion
goes along with him out of
the Pulpit. Hee comes not
vp thrice a weeke because
he would not bee idle, nor
talkes three houres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because hee would
not talke nothing: but
his tongue Preaches at fit
times; and his conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is the euery dayes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.
In matters of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
hee is not ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious,
but thinkes hee
owes that reuerence to the
Church to bow his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:23627:14"/>
to it, and make more
conscience of schisme, then
a Surplesse. Hee esteemes
the Churches Hirarchie,
as the Churches glory, and
how-euer wee iarre with
Rome, would not haue our
confusion distinguish vs.
In Symoniacall purchases
he thinks his Soule goes in
the bargaine, and is loath
to come by promition so
deare. Yet his worth at
the length aduances him,
and the price of his owne
merit buyes him a Liuing.
He is no base Grater of his
Tythes, and will not wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
for the odde Egge. The
Lawyer is the onely man
he hinders, he is spited for
<pb facs="tcp:23627:15"/>
taking vp quarrels. Hee
is a maine pillar of our
Church, though not yet
Deane nor Canon, and
his life our Religions best

of Piemont, or the
Regiment of Health. The
best Cure hee ha's done is
vpon his own purse, which
from a leane sicklinesse he
hath made lusty, and in

much in reckoning vp the
hard names of diseases,
and the superscriptions of
<pb facs="tcp:23627:16"/>
Gally-pots in his Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
Shoppe, which are
rank't in his Shelues, and

holds <hi>Vespatians</hi> rule, that

helpe it. He translates his
Apothecaries Shop into
your Chamber, and the

He tels you your Maladie
in Greeke, though it be but
a cold, or head-ach: which
by good endeauor and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
hee may bring to
some moment indeed; his
most vnfaithfull act is, that
hee leaues a man gasping,
<pb facs="tcp:23627:17"/>
and his pretence is, death
and he haue a quarrell, and
must not meete; but his
feare is, least the Carcasse
should bleed. Anatomies
and other spectacles of
Mortality haue hardened
him, and hee's no more
struck with a Funerall then
a Graue-maker. Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
vse him for a director
of their stomacks, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
for wantonnesse, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if hee bee a proper

His eminencie aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

He much pities the

for he can tell him nothing
but what hee knowes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and yet he loues him
to, because he is like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
Men are mercifull to
him, and let him alone, for
if he be once driuen from

His own bitter enemy, and
discontent presently makes

You may as soone

He offers you a Pottle

see you, and in requitall of
this courtesie, you can doe
no lesse then pay for it. He
is fumbling with his purse-strings,
as a Schoole-boy
with his points, when hee
is going to bee Whipt, till
the Master wearie with

When the reckoning is
payd, he sayes it must not
bee so, it is strait pacified,
and cryes what remedie.
<pb facs="tcp:23627:35"/>
His borrowings are like
Subsidies, each man a shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

dispend, which they lend
him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not with the hope to

they feare him as a credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
He is proud of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,

which he will be sure

vpon nice Pinnes, to bee
<pb facs="tcp:23627:45"/>
turning and flexible for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
motion, but his scrape
is homely, and his nod
worse. He cannot kisse his
hand and cry Madame,
nor talke idly enough to
beare her company. His
smacking of a Gentle-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is somewhat too sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uory,
and he mistakes her
nose for her lippe. A very
Woodcock would puzzle
him in caruing, and hee
wants the logicke of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.
He has not the glib fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of sliding ouer a tale,
but his words come squea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishly
out of his mouth,
and the laughter common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before the iest. He names
this word Colledge too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb facs="tcp:23627:45"/>
and his discourse beats
too much on the Vniuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
The perplexity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerlinesse
will not let him
feed, and he is sharpe set at
an Argument when hee
should cut his meate. He is
discarded for a gamester at
all games but one and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and at tables he reaches
not beyond doublets. His
fingers are not long and
drawn out to handle a Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
but his fist is clunch't
with the habite of dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
He ascends a Horse
somwhat sinisterly, though
not on the left side, and
they both goe iogging in
griefe together. He is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
censur'd by the
<pb facs="tcp:23627:46"/>
Innes a Court men, for
that hainous Vice being
out of fashion. Hee cannot
speake to a Dogge in his
owne Dialect, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
Greeke better then
the language of a Falconer.
Hee has beene vsed to a
darke roome, and darke
Clothes, and his eyes daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle
at a Sattin Doublet.
The Hermitage of his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
has made him somwhat
vncouth in the world, and
men make him worse by
staring on him. Thus is he
silly and ridiculous, and it
continues with him for
some quarter of a yeare,
out of the Vniuersitie. But
practise him a little in men,
<pb facs="tcp:23627:46"/>
and brush him ore with
good companie, and hee
shall out-ballance those
glisterers as much as a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid

idle for it is all Action, and
no man need be more wary

His Profession ha's in it a

do's not only personate on

the Street, for he is mask'd
still in the habit of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.
His Parts find him
oathes and good words,
which he keeps for his vse

tragicall on the Stage, but
rampant in the Tyring-house,
and sweares oathes
there which he neuer con'd.
The waiting women Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators
are ouer-eares in

bringing them down with
his Tongue to his owne

when hee cannot ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach

Hee comes to Publique
<pb facs="tcp:23627:49"/>
things not to learne, but to
catch, and if there bee but

on all things with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

still furnisht with a Pish

Prouerbe that dis-relishes

Hee will grant you

take away all hee

still with an Oh but,
and I coud wish one thing
amended; and this one
thing shal be enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face

Hee will bee
very inward with a man to
fish some bad out of him,
and make his slanders here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after

when it is said a friend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported

you to naughtinesse to get
your good name into his

He passes the more plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
because all men haue a
smatch of his humour, and
it is thought freenes which
is malice. If he can say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:23627:50"/>

seeme to speak riddles, as if

if he would: and when he

But I wish him well, and
therfore must hold my
peace. He is alwayes list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

hee heard there were
the best Fencing and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing-Schooles,
from these
he has his Education, from

The first Element of his
knowledge is to be shewne
the Colledges, and initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a Tauerne by the

wil learne of himselfe. The

is the bare Veluet of his

at Tennis, where when
hee can once play a Set,
he is a Fresh-man no more.
His Studie has common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
handsome Shelues, his
Bookes near Silke strings,
which he shewes to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
man, and is loth to
vntye or take downe for
feare of misplacing. Vpon
foule dayes for recreation
hee retyres thither, and
looks ouer the prety booke
his Tutor Reades to him,
which is commonly some
short Historie, or a piece of
<hi>Euphormio;</hi> for which his
Tutor giues him Money
to spend next day. His

maine loytering is at the
Library, where he studies
Armes and bookes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and turnes a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Critick
in Pedigrees.
Of all things he endures
not to bee mistaken for a
Scholler, and hates a black
suit though it be of Sattin.
His companion is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
some stale fellow, that
ha's beene notorious for
an Ingle to gold hatbands,
whom he admires at first,
afterward scornes. If hee
haue spirit or wit, he may
light of better company,
and may learne some fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes

doe him Knights seruice in

sell for three halfe-pence,
though they are giuen oft
for three Shillings, but for
the prety Title that allures
the Country Gentleman:
and for which the Printer
maintaines him in Ale a

like his clothes, miserable
Cento's and patches, yet
their pace is not altogether
<pb facs="tcp:23627:53"/>
so hobbling as an Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks.
The death of a great
man or the burning of a
house furnish him with
an Argument, and the

<hi>Melpomine cryes</hi> Fire, Fire.
His other Poems are but
Briefs in Rime, and like the

to redeeme from captiuity.
He is a man now much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd

of our Nauy, and a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Workes goe out in single

from market to market, to
a vile tune, and a worse

throat, whilst the poore
Country wench melts like
her butter to heare them.
And these are the Stories
of some men of Tyburne,
or a strange Monster out
of Germany: or sitting in
a Baudy-house; hee writes
Gods Iudgements. Hee

he is a good Christian to
his power (that is) comes
to Church in his best

his Neighbours, where he
is capable onely of two

Sunday he esteemes a day

thinkes a Bag-pipe as es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall
to it, as Euening
Prayer, where hee walkes
<pb facs="tcp:23627:61"/>
very solemnly after seruice
with his hands coupled
behind him, and censures
the dauncing of his parish.
His complement with his
Neighbour is a good

his salutation commonly
some blunt Curse. Hee
thinkes nothing to bee vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

loose to the World, and
Fortune, from which the

preseru'd him: and

him. Hee is indeed iust of
age to be miserable, yet in

the outside of the World

<pb facs="tcp:23627:62"/>
them according to their

of this ignorance beleeues
them. He pursues all vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for happinesse, and

not to curbe but vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his appetite, and
prosecute the motions

his owne temptation, and
needs not Satan; and the
World will come hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Hee leaues repentance

He conceiues his Youth as

the Houre wherein hee
ought to bee bad: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would not lose his

Religion as a sad thing, and
is sixe yeeres elder for a

scornes and feares, and yet
hopes for old age, but dare
not imagine it with wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
Hee loues and hates

and when the heate is ouer
is coole alike to friends and
enemies. His friendship is
seldome so stedfast but that

lust, drinke, or anger may
ouerturne it. He offers you
his blood to day in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

yours to morrow. He do's

hee wishes not to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,

great affecter of wits and
such pretinesses; and his
company is costly to him,
for he seldom ha's it but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited.
His friendship com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

The Tanerne is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

drinke and to be drunke, is
with him all one, and his
braine is sooner quenchd
then his thirst. He is drawn
into naughtines with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
but suffers alone,
and the Bastard common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laid to his charge. One
that will bee patiently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd,
and take excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
a Moneth after when
he vnderstands it, and then
<pb facs="tcp:23627:77"/>
not endeare him more
then by coozening him,
and it is a temptation to
those that would not. One
discouerable in all sillines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to all men but himselfe,
&amp; you may take any mans
knowledge of him better
then his owne. Hee will
promise the same thing to
twentie, and rather then
denie one breake with all.
One that ha's no power
o're himselfe, o're his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
o're his friends: but
a prey and pitie to all: and
if his fortunes once sinke,
men quickly crie alas, and

Preach, and in this point
onely thinkes the Brownist
erroneous: but what shee
cannot at the Church, shee
do's at the Table, where
she prattles more then any

the Priests of <hi>Baal</hi> Reading
Ministers, and thinkes the
Saluation of that Parish as
desperate as the Turkes.
Shee is a maine derider to
her capacitie of those that
are not her Preachers, and
censures all Sermons but
bad ones. If her Husband

too hard for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
His Learning is too
much for his brayne; and
his iudgment too little for
his learning, and his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opinion
of both spoyls all
Pity it was his mischance
of being a Scholler; for it
do's only distract and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate
him &amp; the world by
him. He hammers much in
generall vpon our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
vncertainety, and the
possibility of erring makes
him not venture on what is
true. He is troubled at this
naturalnesse of Religion to
Countries, that Protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
should bee borne so
in England and Popery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and that fortune
<pb facs="tcp:23627:93"/>
and the Starres should so
much share in it. He likes
not this connexion of the
Common-weale, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity,
and feares it may be
an Arch-practice of State.
In our differences with
Rome he is strangely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix't,
and a new man euery

transport him. Hee could

would come to vs sooner,
but our new name affrights
him. He is taken with their

hee conceiues of
our Doctrine better; but it
<pb facs="tcp:23627:93"/>
seemes too empty and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
He cannot driue into
his fancy the circumscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

and is as hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to thinke their old

wel of our Faith, and more
of their workes, and is
sometimes much affected
at the zeale of Amsterdam.
His conscience interposes
it selfe betwixt Duellers,
and whillst it would part
both, is by both wounded.

and you may sooner picke

so many wise men should
be in error, nor so many

and his wounder is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,

cannot anger him worse
then with a Fathers <hi>dixit,</hi>
and yet that many are not
perswaded with reason,

In summe, his whole life is
