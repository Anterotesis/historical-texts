            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>NE would have thought, that when the Ancient Doctrine of a Trinity in Unity, had not only been contradicted, but openly scorn'd and ridicul'd with as little Modesty as Sense, it had been no unpardonable Crime to undertake the Defence thereof: But it seems a certain <hi>Stander-by</hi> being a little touch'd with Melancholy, could not bear such an Attempt; for this is <hi>to litigate touching a Fundamental</hi>; and that is <hi>to turn it into a Controversy; that is, to unsettle,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</hi> p. 7.</note> at least endanger the unsettling the whole Superstructure.</hi> So that when some <hi>Learned Writers</hi> took upon them to chastise the Insolence of these Busy and Factious Underminers of Christianity, who in the opinion of any one that is not overrun with <hi>Melancholy,</hi> must be thought by their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50617:4"/>
bold Attempts upon the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of our Faith, to have endeavour'd <hi>the unsettling the whole Superstructure</hi>; this <hi>Stander-by</hi> was put into a sudden Fright, to see men so unreasonable, as to write in Vindication of a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Article of the Christian Faith, which it becomes <hi>Peaceable</hi> men rather tamely and silently to give up, than to <hi>litigate</hi> concerning it: And therefore he addresses in <hi>An Earnest and Compassionate Suit</hi> to the <hi>Learned Writers</hi> in Defence of the Churches Doctrine, to hold their hands, and forbear at least till <hi>a fit time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it seems All men had not the same Sentiments of this <hi>Peaceable Design,</hi> as the <hi>Melancholy</hi> Author of it had; nor could the <hi>Compassiona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e Suit</hi> work its hop'd-for effects on the minds of All <hi>Learned Writers.</hi> 'Tis no wonder therefore that the <hi>Dean of St. Pauls</hi> was not thereby discouraged from resuming the <hi>Defence of the Catholick Faith</hi>; but only thought it necessary, <hi>before he ventured to dispute these matters any farther, to make some Apology for Disputing</hi>; and to show, that notwithstanding what this Author endeavours to persuade the world, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Vnchristian,</hi> nor <hi>Vncharitable,</hi> nor of <hi>Dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>Apology</hi> of the <hi>Dean</hi>'s did, it seems, stir the Spleen of our <hi>Stander-by,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Antap.</hi> p. 1.</note> and move the Choler of this <hi>Peaceable</hi> and <hi>Modest Person, who would</hi> (but it seems he could not, especially towards the Church of <hi>England) observe the common Rules of Good Manners:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must not blame him, if in his Reply to the <hi>Dean</hi> we do (notwithstanding his designing the contrary, and <hi>composing his Mind as far as he was able</hi>) meet with <hi>Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness, Passion, Cavilling, Insolence,</hi> and <hi>Ill Language</hi>; for tho he will <hi>not pardon such things in himself,</hi> (and therefore 'tis to be hop'd will do private Penance for them) yet it may become us to pardon them, and let it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50617:4"/>
pass, as he says too many do, <hi>for a Point of Justice in such case, calcare fastum majori fastu.</hi> And besides, since he owns, that <hi>'tis not without difficulty that Human Nature forbears rendring an Angry and Disdainful Reply to Haughty and Ill-natur'd Answers,</hi> or those which are fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied to be such; if he does now and then do so himself, we may suppose it was because he could not help it, and therefore it is excusable; for I hope the Plea which he makes for Hereticks, may serve also for himself; and if a man <hi>must Conceive as he can, and Judge as he can, and Believe as he can,</hi> so he must also Write as he can.</p>
            <p>And this I think will also be a sufficient Apology to our Author, for my not being of his mind; for since <hi>I must conceive as I can, and judge as I can,</hi> I find that for my life I cannot judge his Discourse to be either rational or well design'd; but rather, as he would fain have the world think of the Endeavours of other <hi>Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Vnreasonable, Vnseasonable, and of Dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence</hi>: And therefore without any farther Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I shall venture to bestow some short Remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; in which I shall also confine my self to the main Design of the Book, which is, (as we shall hear him confessing himself anon) To dissuade men from Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Defence of the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity</hi>; and therefore I shall not think my self concerned to enlarge in the Confutation of those Arguments against the <hi>Dean's Hypothesis,</hi> which ever and anon he gives us into the bargain; for my business is only to consider what he says in Defence of his <hi>Peaceable Design</hi> of persuading All men, as well as the Dean, not to write in Defence of the Truth, if he thinks it so.</p>
            <p>But I must desire one thing of <hi>Our Author,</hi> That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he falls foul on the <hi>Dean</hi> for pretending to know his <hi>Intent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ant.</hi> p. 11.</note> when <hi>he wanted the Gift of discerning Spirits
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50617:5"/>
to capacitate him for being a Judge of it,</hi> he would take notice, That I do not pretend to know his inward <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> any more than his Name. And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I shall say in my Reflections, let him not pretend that I do it to <hi>calumniate</hi> and <hi>inodiate</hi> him, since all I have to do with, is his Book.</p>
            <p>But now let us come closer to the purpose, and be <hi>plain and succinct,</hi> as far as <hi>our Author</hi>'s intricate way of Writing will permit, who begins (as he also goes on) with heavy Accusations against the <hi>Dean</hi> for his <hi>Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Insolence, Ill Language, Indignities, False Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and at least seemingly malicious insinuations against himself</hi>: Whether all this be true, and whether the <hi>Dean</hi> in any place treats him with greater Sharpness than such a Writer deserves, must be left to the Impartial Reader to judge.</p>
            <p>One of the <hi>False Imputations</hi> with which he charges the <hi>Dean,</hi> is, That he says, <hi>He called the</hi> Socinians <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Writers of Controversy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 2.</note> whom he now <hi>protests</hi> he <hi>did not mean</hi> by that Character: And tho his Title-Page be so ambiguous, that it might easily be mistaken either for a <hi>Suit</hi> to <hi>Learned Writers,</hi> or for <hi>Forbearance</hi> to <hi>Learned Writers</hi>; yet I am apt to believe him, because he has not dissuaded the <hi>Socinians</hi> from Writing against the <hi>Trinity,</hi> but other <hi>Learned Writers</hi> from Writing for it: A good Orthodox Excuse.</p>
            <p>But <hi>waving this and many Instances of the like Disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, he will present here the main State of the Cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Dean and himself</hi>; which in short is this, <hi>That the Disputes touching the Controversies of the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, might be at present let alone,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ant.</hi> p. 3. Sect. 2.</note> 
               <hi>till fit time and place</hi>; I suppose he means only by the Orthodox Writers, who defend that Doctrine; for he himself <hi>protests,</hi> that by <hi>Learned Writers,</hi> to whom he addressed his <hi>Suit,</hi> he did
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50617:5"/>
not mean <hi>Socinians: And to persuade to this, he had said, This particular Controversy is of all others at present most unreasonable, most dangerous, and most unseasonable.</hi> This may pass for a state of the Question; and I will leave it to the Reader to judge upon the whole, whether the <hi>Dean</hi> has not quite overthrown this state of his Question, and sufficiently demonstrated the Weakness of all he urged.</p>
            <p>Now he is desirous to know, <hi>Where is the mischief of all this</hi>: For <hi>all that he designed was plainly</hi> no more then, <hi>to move for Peace, at least for a Truce, till both Parties were calmed, and might calmly Treat.</hi> But, methinks, the fairest way for this had been, to desire both Parties to hold their hands, and not only to beseech one to be silent, and let the others Write, and Talk, and Rail, and Argue on too as well as they can against the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Doctrine. But methinks this very project of a <hi>Truce</hi> does not seem very reasonable, for it looks as if he thought the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>Socinians</hi> to be upon equal terms with one another, which I can by no means grant; because the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in this Point at least, has had Sixteen hundred years prescription, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Authority of Scripture and Reason on her side. Nor can I think any Treaty lawful in such Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Points, but that all Catholick Christians are bound to do what they can by Reason to convince these men of their Errors, and reduce them into the Bosom of the Church; for I do not like our Authors way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding with Hereticks and Shismaticks, and I hope <hi>Posterity may find better Expedients for Vniting of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> than for the sake of Peace to give up truth.</p>
            <p>But here though our Author could bear, what he thinks a <hi>modest and just reprehension,</hi> yet he is very angry with what the Dean says, and looks upon it as <hi>imperious
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50617:6"/>
beyond measure,</hi> especially when the <hi>great Argument of all, is no better than a</hi> petitio principij, <hi>that the Doctrine of the Trinity, as Dr.</hi> Sherlock <hi>hath stated it, and does defend it, is a fundamental of the Christian Faith.</hi> Now this I take to be a false imputation upon the Dean, who does indeed, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> does, look on the Doctrine of <hi>Three Persons</hi> and <hi>One God,</hi> as <hi>a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the Christian Faith</hi>; and this he endeavours to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate from those Absurdities and Contradictions which are charged upon it, and gives such an Explication of it, as though he believes to be true, he does not lay down as necessary to be expresly believed by all; nor will he esteem any man a Heretick who sincerely believes the Doctrine of the Church, that there is but <hi>One God and Three Persons,</hi> though he does not subscribe in all things to his <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> And therefore I think the <hi>Antapologist</hi> is fallen into a fit of <hi>Melancholy</hi> when he complains of the Dean,<note place="margin">P. 4.</note> because in his Apology <hi>he quits his Adversary,</hi> and neglects <hi>all that has been said against his Novelties, and falls upon exposing the Peaceable man.</hi> Now I should rather have wondred, if in an Apology for Writing against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> he had entred into the main sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Debate, when his only business was to show the weakness of such <hi>Earnest Suits,</hi> as desired that no man should Write any thing in the present Controversy; so that I cannot but think the <hi>Antapologist</hi> is a little, if not besides himself, I am sure a great deal besides the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to make it a matter of Accusation against the Dean, that he keeps close to the proper Subject of his Discourse; for I would here only ask him, Whether in his <hi>Suit</hi> he undertook a Confutation of the Dean's Hypothesis? If he did not, then I hope his Book may be pertinently An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and solidly Confuted too, without entring into the merits of that Cause. I would ask him also, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50617:6"/>
he did not Address to all <hi>Learned Writers against the Socinians in this Conttoversy,</hi> as well as to the Dean? And whether what he urges be not level'd against any man's Writing in Defence of the Established Doctrine, as well as of the Dean's particular Hypothesis? If so, 'tis plain that the Dean did very well, not to run out into a Vindication of his own <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> or of the Doctrine of the Trinity in general; <hi>but to fall upon exposing the Peaceable man,</hi> as our Author terms it; that is, to show the insufficiency of all his pleas for Forbearance towards the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and betraying the Christian Faith, under the pretence of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Moderation.</hi>
            </p>

As for the <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain signification of Philosophical Terms,</hi> methinks he should not quarrel at that, which may afford his Friends the better shelter, and permit every one under the same words to couch his own meaning.</p>

               <hi>he did not contest ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these Points</hi>; and yet in the very Page before, he complains of the Dean, because in his Answer <hi>he did not offer one Word to prove his own new Notions</hi>; which yet he owns he did not contest with him, and <hi>is still as willing as ever to decline engaging,</hi> but <hi>only in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50617:7"/>
his own defence</hi> he can't forbear declaring, <hi>That the Dean has to his power overthrown the True Catholick Faith of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Creed, as much as</hi> Philoponus <hi>or</hi> Joachim <hi>ever did; nor will his Invention of Mutual Consciousness clear him from the Charge of inferring Three Gods, since that can infer only an Vnity of Accord,</hi> &amp;c. This he says, but does not here go about to prove it, because <hi>these things require more Words than the present Design admits,</hi> and it may be more Reason than he is Master of; and therefore 'tis as easy for me, and as allowable to say, That the Dean's <hi>Mutual Consciousness</hi> does infer more than <hi>an Vnity of Accord,</hi> as for him to say it does not: And that it does infer full as great, if not a greater <hi>Vnity of Substance and Nature,</hi> than the words of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed express; and if it were not for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which he himself has given, I should not care though I ventured to dispute this matter with him at large.</p>

agreeable to their own Doctrines. But after all this <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty</hi> of the <hi>word Person,</hi> about which he has shown so much Learning, as far as I can find there is so much of its Signification agreed to on all hands, that the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinitarians</hi> are unwilling to use it, as evidently inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding something that will not go down with them; and I fear that this is the true reason of our Author's Quarrel against it.</p>
            <p>But now our Author has shown himself such a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Books, he can't forbear stepping a little out of the way again, to show himself as great a Master of Reason, and therefore falls foul upon the Dean for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting himself,<note place="margin">P. 8.</note> for making <hi>Three Minds</hi> and <hi>One Mind,</hi> and making <hi>the Persons Distinct,</hi> and <hi>not Separate,</hi> which is <hi>to him an unavoidable Contradiction:</hi> And who can help it if it be? What the <hi>Dean</hi> maintains, is not so to every body's apprehension; especially if it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in his own words, without our Author's Comment on them; for it may be understood how Three Minds are One, tho it be something difficult to apprehend <hi>that they are three sames,</hi> and <hi>not three sames</hi>: And I can no more understand our Author's arguing, That <hi>if they are Distinct, they are Separate also,</hi> than he can the Dean's, when he says <hi>they are Distinct and yet not Separate</hi>; which I believe will not sound like an Absurdity to any but a <hi>Socinian Vnderstanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the Dean has been mistaken, and has fallen short in his Arguing, and has also set up an Hypothesis full of Contradictions, which yet there are a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wiser men than our Author do not believe, what would all this be to the Design of our Author's Book? If Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> does not argue well, must no body there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore write, that can argue better? If his Hypothesis be unreasonable, is it therefore unreasonable to write in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

of the Doctrine of the Trinity? Or is the Doctrine it self unreasonable? Some men we know think so; and this may be several strokes in his Book be suspected to be the Opinion of our Author.</p>
            <p>However, he is so great a Lover of Peace (why then does he quarrel so much with the Orthodox Writers, and the Church of <hi>England</hi>?) that he is willing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>the old way of speaking, and the Ancient Notion of a Divine Person,</hi> as being <hi>more consistent and less obnoxious: Which if it had been kept to, he had f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Imputation of <hi>Disguised Heretick,</hi> &amp;c. What he is, I determine not, but I am sure he writes just as if he were such an one; and since he has not set his Name, I can't apprehend it any ways uncharitable to suspect so much of an unknown Author, of whom we have nothing else to judge by but his Book, which I am sure will never prove that he is any thing better, and does well deserve to have a Brand set upon it, that unwary Readers may not be deceived by it. And this I believe, whatever he doth, very few Orthodox Hearty Asserters of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith, will think a <hi>Calumny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the Dean's <hi>New Hypothesis</hi> again, who did not keep within bounds, and stop where he ought to have done, but must needs be rambling, and therefore he must have a lash or two for that. And for the Reader's great Edification, our kind Author will give an account how far he had read of the Dean's Book when he writ, which, and several other as weighty Accounts of himself and his private Concerns, I leave to the Reader that has Curiosity enough to peruse them.</p>
            <p>But the Dean holds that which necessarily infers Three Gods, and <hi>in his Apology goes beyond himself,</hi> as <hi>in his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> he <hi>went plainly beyond</hi> and <hi>contrary to the Doctrine of the Fathers, Schools, and Protestant Divines.</hi> Pray what's the matter now? Why, he calls <hi>the Son a God In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost a God</hi>; and therefore infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly by vertue of this little Particle <hi>a,</hi> there must be Three Gods, all the world can't help it: For tho he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly says, These Three are but <hi>One God,</hi> and proves it too, yet as long as he says the <hi>Son is a God Incarnate,</hi> there is nothing can vindicate him from the Imputation of Tritheism; and therefore he must according to his Promise, <hi>thankfully correct this Absurdity,</hi> now it is so plainly shown him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50617:9"/>But does <hi>a God Incarnate</hi> signify any more, but that he who is Incarnate is God? Which if we were always to deal with such Criticks, is a much safer way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than to say he is <hi>God Incarnate</hi>; for among those who own a Trinity of Divine Persons in the Godhead, <hi>a God Incarnate</hi> can signify no more, than that One of the Divine Persons, who is really and truly God, is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate; but to say <hi>God Incarna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next Complaint of <hi>our Author</hi> is, That the Dean <hi>charges him with desiring that no body would write aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The first is, That <hi>others as well as</hi> Socinians <hi>are Heterodox in this Point</hi>: But the <hi>Dean</hi> and Dr. <hi>Wallis</hi> writ only against <hi>Socinians,</hi> and he owns his <hi>Suit</hi> was chiefly to them, and no body else is particularly named in his <hi>Suit,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Dean</hi> guessed pretty right, and had some reason for his guess. <hi>2dly. These are not the only Points in which they are Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Doctor</hi> had liberty to <hi>write against them in other Points</hi>: But still was not he and every body else desired to forbear them in these their principal Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors? And did the Dean charge him with any thing more? For in this present Controversy what had he to do with their other Errors? And yet I believe many at least of his Reasons for not writing, will hold as well in other Points as in this of the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50617:9"/>In the next place he gives an account why he stiles himself a <hi>Stander by,</hi> which does not become any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in such a Fundamental Article of the Christian Faith. The first Reason he gives, is his mean opinion of his own Skill in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy, but it is modestly express'd with a <hi>perhaps,</hi> and therefore <hi>perhaps</hi> it was his ill opinion of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy it self. His next Reason is, That every one who is skill'd at his Weapon <hi>must not draw upon every one he meets begirt with a Sword,</hi> but if they draw upon him, or to take it out of the Metaphor, assault the Catholick Faith, which every Christian is concerned in, and every Divine concern'd to defend, it does not become him to be a <hi>Stander by,</hi> but to use his Skill to defend himself and his Faith; for to be a <hi>Stander-by</hi> in such cases, in plain <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> is to be a Neuter; and when there is a dispute of Faith, if a Neuter be not a Heretick, he cannot be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, for he is on neither side, if we can suppose a Medium between these two.</p>
            <p>In the next place he does not like to be thought <hi>tender on the wrong side</hi>; but certainly he is so, if he means any thing that he speaks. He readily owns what I believe no body will lay to his charge, That he has shown <hi>a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness to the Church of</hi> England <hi>and the</hi> Nicene <hi>Faith</hi>; I suppose by those severe Reflections which he makes upon both, and his Burlesque of the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed and the Litany, which as yet stand in our Liturgy, and are like to do so, till it fall into the hands of such <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi> Reformers, as out of pure Tenderness for the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Old Reformation, are for changing the Frame of our most Fundamental Articles, or resolving them all into a mere <hi>Negative Belief,</hi> which is to leave no positive Faith in the Church. And here <hi>our Author</hi> would know how he is <hi>Tender on the Wrong side,</hi> when he has only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd

               <hi>a tenderness for the Church of</hi> England, <hi>the Credit of the Reformation, and for Peace and Holiness</hi>; and I'le warrant you, has not said one word in favour of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian Heresy,</hi> and therefore <hi>the Dean may keep his profound politick Notes, of mens tenderness being due to their Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, for better purposes:</hi> What these purposes are, I know not, but certainly 'tis no improbable conjecture, that men have some <hi>Inclinations</hi> to that, for which they express a great tenderness, though tis possible this Rule may sometimes fail, and that <hi>tenderness,</hi> which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor saith he has <hi>expressed for the Church of</hi> England, may not be <hi>due to his Inclinations.</hi>

As to what he says, That <hi>Voluntary Disputings have never suppressed, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived old Heresies</hi>; If he means by <hi>Voluntary Disputing,</hi> a necessary Defence, as he must mean if it be any thing to the present purpose, 'tis very wisely thought of, that disputing against those who revive and propagate old Heresies, is the thing which <hi>revives</hi> them.</p>
            <p>How this Projector for the Churches peace, <hi>would have those who should Write in this Controversy authorized, he will set down anon,</hi> and then 'twill be time enough to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the wisdom of his Contrivance: Let us in the mean time come to his <hi>Latitude of Faith,</hi> which is another branch of his notable project for Peace, which he still adheres to, though, I think, he has given little or no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to what the Dean urged against it; so that the Dean's Arguments hold good still notwithstanding his Exceptions against them: Nor are we one dram the wiser for all that fine Lecture which he here reads con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Latitude,</hi> as a Metaphorical term derived from <hi>Astronomy, Geography, Triple Dimensions,</hi> or what else you please; nor yet for his citation from one who, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, was far enough from <hi>his Latitude of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For I can't yet find what he would be at in the present point, unless it be, what he has been already charged with, That every man should be let alone to believe what he pleases, so he doth but profess to believe the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50617:11"/>
Words of Scripture, though in never so perverse a sense. This I can't believe is that <hi>Latitude</hi> in which the Apostles left the <hi>Faith.</hi> He says, <hi>To leave Faith in the Latitude in which it was delivered, is to impose no Determinations of such words (</hi> i.e. <hi>of such words as may carry with them different Notions) as necessary to Salvation, but to allow each Person to believe the matter propounded in one of those senses, whatever it be, which the words naturally bear, and which in his Conscience he judges truest.</hi> This don't seem either safe or reasonable, because a Word or Phrase may naturally be capable of divers senses, and yet it may be demonstrable that in one place it must be taken in one sense, and in another place in another sense; so that to take it in the wrong sense in either place, may be Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, Absurd and Heretical. Now I am persuaded that the Apostles never intended to leave <hi>Faith</hi> in this <hi>Latitude,</hi> nor was it reasonable they should, for then we need profess but one General Article, <hi>That the Scriptures are true,</hi> and every man should be left to make what he would of them; which would be a pretty and easy kind of Unity of Faith, comprehending all, or at least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Heresies, for which some places of Scripture are always urged by their Abettors, which seem to them naturally to signify what they assert, or at least they say so; and our Author has told us in another place, That we are to <hi>believe</hi> them in what they <hi>constantly profess.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if he means only, That we should not impose any more <hi>determinate</hi> Signification <hi>on such Words,</hi> than what the Apostles appear to have design'd them in, nor limit them to such <hi>Specialties</hi> as they cannot be proved to be limited to in Scripture, we agree with him. But this will not serve his Cause, for here we must take in the Circumstances of the Place, the Coherence with other Texts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then we will limit them no farther than
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50617:11"/>
what evidently appears to be the true sense of them; and so far we think it reasonable to limit them, and not to leave every one to interpret them as he fancies, and yet be obliged to account him Orthodox, and not to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his False and Erroneous Interpretations; which is to permit all Heresies to go on, and never say a word against them.</p>
            <p>But I hope he will allow, That all Scripture has some determinate Sense, or else it signifies nothing; and that this Sense in the great Articles of Faith is obvious and intelligible to Impartial, Diligent, and Unprejudiced Seekers, and that as far as this determinate Sense we ought all to agree: For tho in some lesser matters we cannot easily fix this determinate Sense, nor know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly what it is, and therefore may without any great danger be ignorant, and may own our Ignorance; yet as to the Prime Articles of our Faith, we ought certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to understand them in some determinate sense; (tho under that <hi>Compass</hi> some <hi>Specialties</hi> may be contain'd, to either of which it is not necessary to determine our As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) for else indeed we do not understand them at all, and do only repeat a huddle of words when we confess our Faith.</p>
            <p>Now if our Author can show me some plain deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Sense of those Places which we urge, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends under it both what we assert, and what the <hi>Socinians</hi> maintain, only as such <hi>Specialties,</hi> either of which may agree with the natural Sense and plain Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Words in all those places, I will join with him in desiring no body to write against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> at least not with any Warmth or Zeal, as allowing them to be no Hereticks, nor involved in any dangerous Errors.</p>
            <p>In the next Paragraph, because the Dean was not good at guessing, he will explain what he meant by <hi>Simplicity
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50617:12"/>
of Faith,</hi> and not any longer <hi>leave it to guess,</hi> though he first of all gives the Dean liberty to take it in what sense he please, even in that of <hi>Foolishness,</hi> and thinks that <hi>the Apostle would in a sort justify the expression</hi>; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apostle nor common sense will justify the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency of it in this place. He tells us then, that he really meant <hi>Plainness, Vnmixedness, Purity</hi>; and I believe the Dean is as desirous as he, that the Faith should be preserved as <hi>Plain</hi> and as <hi>Pure</hi> as the Apostles left it, and yet I fancy that will not hinder him nor any man else from defending it against the rude Assaults of Hereticks, nor from using reason in its Defence: For the Dean's design is to keep the Christian Faith <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Vnmixt</hi> from Heretical Glosses, which make it quite another thing than what the Apostles left it, and not as our Author fears, to <hi>vamp Philosophy into Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now the Dean must answer for what he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to say in favour of the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and must be confuted from his own words, for asking such an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable question, as, <hi>What hurt have they done?</hi> And here he spends Three Pages to show his own reading, and the <hi>Schoolmens</hi> Follies, and particularly those of the <hi>Master</hi> of the Sentences; but I have more wit than to follow him through all these Particulars. In short there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I suppose the Dean did not intend to justify every thing that they said, but only thought <hi>they had done no harm by the words Person, Nature, Essence, Subsistence,</hi> and <hi>Consubstantiality,</hi> which the Dean expresly mention'd, and thought them a good Defence against Hereticks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing themselves under Scripture-Phrases. And that the Dean did not intend to vindicate them in all things, nor to fix on them the Character of Infallibility, is plain from what our Author cites: And that the use of these words hath done more harm than good, I leave our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50617:12"/>
to prove at his leisure; and so pass over all his tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Harangue against the <hi>School-Doctors</hi>; let him bang them about by himself, and vent his displeasure against them as long as he will, it may be a good exercise, and serve to divert his Anger from the Church of <hi>England</hi> and its Orthodox Defenders: But how he and the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverter will agree the matter, I cannot guess.</p>
            <p>And it may be 'twas this that mollified his <hi>Displeasure</hi> by that time he came to the Fathers, who otherwise were like to have smarted for the same kind of Folly, but now are like to come off pretty well; and he has given us a reason for it, which I like well, because it argues some Modesty: He owns they are guilty as well as the <hi>School-Doctors, but his respect would not let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their Venerable Names:</hi> He has indeed caught them in a great fault, but he is so kind as to let them escape. I am glad he has so much reverence for the Ancient Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, I only wish he had as much for the Ancient Faith, and would let that escape his Lashes too.</p>
            <p>But <hi>the Dean accuses him of not understanding,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 7. p. 18.</note>

               </gap>ere says, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe may be true, but neither does he affirm it to be our Author's case, nor will I, because he now tells us, <hi>he has read them, and thinks he doth generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them</hi>; and I had rather take his word, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test that point with him.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Dean</hi> says,<note place="margin">Sect. 8. p. 20.</note> 
               <hi>he censured even our</hi> English <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers for retaining Scholastick Cramping Terms in their Publick Prayers</hi>; This he denies, but owns that he did <hi>modestly wish that they had observed the same Temper as did the Foreign Reformers</hi>; which implies, that they ought to have done so, and yet did not, which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Modesty</hi> of it, I take to be <hi>censuring</hi> them. Nay, and is not what follows, <hi>Censuring</hi> our Litany and the

Compilers of it? If it be not, I am sure the Dissenters themselves never censured it.</p>
            <p>But by these <hi>Terms,</hi> the <hi>Dean</hi> says <hi>he means the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Litany.</hi> And <hi>how comes he to know his thoughts?</hi> A very pretty question: For how should any man with out conjuring know by his own words, that he meant the Litany, which he prophanely and scornfully ridi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cules? <hi>

But <hi>because the Dean has pitch'd upon the other, he will stick by it.</hi> Generously done: Now let us see how he defends his Censure. <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> are both cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in to help. <hi>Luther</hi> left out that Petition, <hi>O Ho'y, Blessed, and Glorious Trinity, Three Persons and One God:</hi> Of which he confesses the <hi>Lutherans</hi> give another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>German</hi> Word did not so expresly sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify a <hi>Trinity,</hi> as to exclude a <hi>Triplicity</hi>; but he will not allow this to be currant; but I suppose they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood <hi>I uther</hi>'s reason better than he. And then <hi>Calvin</hi> disliked it also; but so he did Episcopacy; and will he think that a sufficient ground to censure our Reformers for retaining it?</p>
            <p>But to what purpose are these Citations? Let them be as express as they will, they are no Argument to us, who are no more bound to acquiesce in their Judgment, than our Author is in that of the Compilers of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50617:13"/>
for whom I think he should have as much Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as either for <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 2<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> But other <hi>Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> also, and our <hi>Nonconformist Countreymen, have strong exceptions against this part of the Litany, which he cannot answer as he would.</hi> I am sorry for it, but I hope there are some others in the Church who can. How <hi>he would have them answered,</hi> I cannot tell, but I suppose he can answer them so as to satisfy himself, which sure cannot be without sufficient reason to justify the Lawfulness of these Forms. And if that can be done, which if it could not, he must be a Hypocrite in using them, I am sure 'tis no sign of a <hi>Tenderness for the Credit of the</hi> English <hi>Reformation,</hi> to endeavour thus to expose it, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish what he thinks to be the Infirmities of it, when this publication can serve no other end than to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage men in their opposition to, and dislike of the Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd Church: Certainly it had been more proper to have reserved these Complaints <hi>till his fit Time and Place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he will grant that <hi>these Forms may be used without sin,</hi> but yet he <hi>judgeth it much safer not to come so near di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Deity, and so far to distract Devotion.</hi> But must we not then lay aside the Apostolical Form of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction in constant use among us, the Doxology, and the Form of Baptism, for fear of <hi>dividing the Deity, and distracting Devotion?</hi> For in all these there is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, distinct, and particular mention of Three, I dare not add <hi>Persons</hi> for fear of offending our Author, as in the Litany. But still he would have <hi>these Forms reduced to more Scriptural ones,</hi> to bring in our own <hi>Dissenters, whom we ought if possible,</hi> I hope I may add, by reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Methods, <hi>to bring in and unite to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here I cannot but observe, that <hi>this</hi> and a great deal more of <hi>his</hi> Book, is directly Writing against the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>Established Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50617:14"/>
of the Church of</hi> England. Now what is this to the design of his Book, to persuade men not to Write in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity?</hi> Did he do that, only that he might have liberty to Ridicule and Expose it? I must confess 'tis a good Argument to engage men not to Write in Defence of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> if he can make it out, that it ought not to be retain'd. But methinks 'tis such a kind of Argument, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaks a man not so much a <hi>Peacemaker,</hi> as a profest Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary. And besides, I would ask him, Whether it be less <hi>Dangerous and less Vnseasonable at present</hi> for him to Write against the Established Doctrine and Worship of the Church, than for others to Write in Defence of them?</p>
            <p>In the next Section he tells us,<note place="margin">Sect. 9. p. 21.</note> That <hi>Vnscriptural Words</hi> were complained of by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as well as by <hi>Hereticks</hi>; and by the <hi>Fathers</hi> first, for which he cites St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> and St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> whom I am not now at leisure to turn over, nor does it seem very material to the present business. St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> he owns Apologizeth for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> from the <hi>Necessity</hi> of it; and if that will be allowed as a good reason, I suppose the <hi>Dean</hi> will not desire more in favour of <hi>Vnscriptural Terms,</hi> and therefore since our <hi>Author</hi> is willing, I think we had as good <hi>let this project stand upon its own merits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here then he is very liberal,<note place="margin">P. 23.</note> and will allow us to <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Scripture from Heretical Glosses.</hi> Why then may we not Write in Defence of the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> and show what is the true sense of Scripture in that Point? And if we may do this, Why is it not seasonable to do it now <hi>Hereticks</hi> are so busy in perverting the true sense of Scripture? And if he will grant us this, the main design of his Book is overthrown. <hi>But when we have plainly proved that these words of Scripture contain this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50617:14"/>
sense, why should we</hi> (I suppose he means in our Creeds and Articles) <hi>change the Words?</hi> I will tell him one short reason, if he does not know it already, and that is because, <hi>when we have proved this to be the true sense of Scripture,</hi> so as to satisfy honest and unprejudiced Minds, yet perverse Hereticks may still take them in their own sense, and so we shall be never the nearer the knowledge of their Minds, nor able to distinguish them, unless we require them to profess they believe them in <hi>that sense,</hi> which we have proved to be the <hi>true sense</hi>; and then it must be in other Words; for though we have shown to all reasonable men, what is the true meaning of them, and so made the sense of the words plain; yet the words are the same that they were; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one who took them in a perverse sense before, may do so still if he will. Besides, why may not any man, who believes that to be the true sense which has been shown so to be, profess his Belief in those terms when required by the Church, as well as in <hi>Scripture Words</hi> which he takes in the same sense?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dean</hi> urges, <hi>They</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> Scripture-Words) <hi>may be undetermined, and 'tis necessary to fix their true sense. But this,</hi> says our Author, <hi>is the Difficulty</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 23.</note> 
               <hi>They may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, at least probably, admit of more senses than one,</hi> &amp;c. He gives an example of this, which is not very much for his Reputation, because it can serve no other end, but to overthrow the Personality of the Holy Ghost, and his Intimate Conscious Knowledge of God; and were my design at present to dispute the sense of particular Texts, it were easy to show, that it is not the Obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Text, but his own Inclination, which makes him fancy his Latitude of Sense; but it is a vain thing in such a cause as this to infer a general Rule from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Instance: For how many instances soever of this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50617:15"/>
nature he could give, if he will allow that there are any express Texts for the Divinity of the Son and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, which will not admit such a Latitude of sense, (as he must acknowledge if he will allow the Doctrine of the Trinity to be a Scripture-Doctrine) there can be no pretence then, to leave such a Fundamental Article in such a Latitude of sense, that men may either own or deny a <hi>Trinity</hi> as they please.</p>
            <p>Further,<note place="margin">P. 25.</note> 
               <hi>He would be clearly for expressing some fixed true sense of all Controverted Tex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s in such Words as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks cannot pervert, but for two or three Reasons,</hi> which are worth hearing: His first Reason is, <hi>because he cannot always be sure which sense is most truly affixed.</hi> But can he never be sure of this in any Texts that have been Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? If he can, then this is no reason why it should not be done in them. His second Reason depends upon the first, and so must stand or fall with that, for where we can be sure which is the <hi>true sense</hi> of Scripture, there is <hi>no</hi> such <hi>danger of changing Faith and changing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> by fixing the sense, but the greater fear is of having no Scripture, if you have no determined sense of it. His last Reason, <hi>as urgent as all the rest,</hi> is, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell <hi>where to find such Words as Hereticks cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert.</hi> I grant some Hereticks are so perverse, as to wrest almost any words to their own sense, or else the <hi>Socinians</hi> could never have wrested such plain Texts of Scripture, and forced them to comply with their Notions. But that some words have been found that <hi>Hereticks could not pervert,</hi> is I think undeniable, since they have and do frequently refuse to subscribe to them and raise such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position against them; as for instance, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, which the <hi>Arians</hi> always opposed. Now if these words did not plainly contain such a sense as doth expressly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their Opinions, why should they not profess their Faith in such words?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50617:15"/>
               <hi>He could assign many words pitch'd upon from time to time, to guard the Faith and prick the fingers of Hereticks,</hi> &amp;c. What then? This is no proof that all words can be perverted, or that none were ever pitch'd upon that could not. As to the <hi>two words</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Personae,</hi> pitch'd upon by him, and so learnedly Criticis'd upon, I shall only say in short, that these and such other words as the <hi>Church of England</hi> delivers her Doctrine in, have <hi>prick'd the fingers of</hi> some men, or else what makes the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> cry out so? There is something plainly signified by them, which the <hi>Antitrinitarians</hi> think not so easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable to their Opinions as the Words of Scripture are, though it be indeed no more than we say and prove to be contain'd in Scripture; or else why do they not rest contented with them as well as with the words of Scripture? Suppose there are some <hi>Homonymies,</hi> as our Author complains, in some words used in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy; will these words admit the <hi>Heresies</hi> against which they are directed? Will they admit <hi>Socinian</hi> Opinions? Or do they contradict them? If they do, then they serve the end for which they were designed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing these <hi>Homonymies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author seems to think, <hi>That Words cannot be found to fix the Sense of Scripture,</hi> unless the same words will exclude <hi>All Heresies</hi> concerning the Subject to which they are apply'd, which is manifestly absurd. For if I confess that God is <hi>Almighty</hi> in the most express terms that can be imagined, may I not for all that affirm, that he is not <hi>Just</hi> or <hi>Good?</hi> And must the word <hi>Almighty</hi> be rejected because it does n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap> exclude <hi>All Heresies</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Divine Nature, though it sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all such Blasphemous Notions as make God a weak and impotent Being. Now though I confess <hi>Three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> in the Godhead, 'tis no wonder that I may never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50617:16"/>
               <hi>hold Heresy, and Blasphemy,</hi> and assert Three Gods too; but can I under these words mean, that there is not a <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> as <hi>Socinians</hi> affirm?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Hereticks may here conceal themselves under a larger Latitude of Expression,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 27.</note> 
               <hi>and spread their Heresies with a Traditionary Sense and Comment of their own, more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more poisonously then the purity of the Holy Text would have permitted.</hi> How shall we be able to deal with this man, who is so well skilled in the versatile wit of Hereticks, that neither Scripture-words, nor all the words made use of by the Antient Fathers with great Caution and Judgment, are able to hold him? I wonder how he knows, what either Heresy or Orthodoxy is as to the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity</hi>; when, if we may believe him, there are no words that do determinately signify either, but both the words of Scripture and Fathers will equally serve both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> now <hi>we must return to the Latitude of Faith,</hi> which the Dean <hi>tragically complains of him for pleading for,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 11. P. 27.</note> &amp;c. Here our Author is much out of humour at some Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Dean put to him; and I do not wonder that it goes against his stomach to answer them <hi>briefly</hi> and <hi>plainly,</hi> though he says he will. For upon reading his <hi>Answers,</hi> they appear neither <hi>brief</hi> nor <hi>plain,</hi> nor can I well tell what to make of his tedious harangue for some Pages together. The Dean asks him, if there be any more Faiths than One; to this indeed he answers <hi>plainly,</hi> That <hi>Faith as Truth can be but One.</hi> But then in what follows he makes it neither <hi>brief</hi> nor <hi>plain</hi>; for though he owns there is but One Christian Faith, he qualifies it very notably, with <hi>And every Truth which Christ and his Apostles taught, ought, if it can be without scruple understood, without scruple to be Believed.</hi> Now I would here ask him, if he will not be offended at my presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50617:16"/>
whether there be not some Christian Truths which ought to be expresly believed by all Christians? this I believe he will grant, because he afterwards says, that <hi>what is Necessary to the Salvation of all is plain.</hi> This is all we desire, and then let <hi>Protestant Divines be as tender as they will in defining the number of Fundamentals</hi>:<note place="margin">p. 28.</note> The only question to our present purpose will be, Whether <hi>the Doctrine of the Trinity</hi> is not one of these <hi>few Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi> which are necessary to Salvation? And if it be, certainly we may be allowed to Write in the Defence of it, and to require the Profession of it from the Members of <hi>our Church</hi>; and surely what is <hi>Fundamental</hi> in this Point is but <hi>One,</hi> and that wherein all ought to agree; and then the <hi>Faith will be but One,</hi> and no such <hi>Fallacy</hi> in the Deans questions as he complains of.</p>
            <p>If he will not allow the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity</hi> to be a <hi>Fundamental,</hi> I think'tis no hard matter to prove it; but that is not my business, nor according to the design of his Book, is it his: 'Tis upon this supposition we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and upon this supposition I would fain see him prove that the <hi>Church</hi> ought not to require an express be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of this Article; but to leave it in such a <hi>Latitude,</hi> as that every one may be <hi>Socinian, Arian, Sabellian,</hi> or what else he please, and yet pass for a very Orthodox Christian.

            <p>And now that this <hi>Latitude</hi> may not pass for his own invention,<note place="margin">p. 31.</note> he tells us, That <hi>God is doubly the Author of a Latitude in Faith.</hi> 1. <hi>In revealing his Truth in such terms as admit of a Latitude of conception</hi>; that is, in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing it at all; for if the terms admit of a <hi>Latitude of conception,</hi> i. e. two contrary senses; which is the truth? Both cannot be, and if both are equally the sense of the words, then the Truth is not revealed, but as far to seek as ever.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50617:18"/>
Fundamental Articles of Christian Faith (for concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such our present Controversy is) in such dubious and ambiguous Phrases, that we cannot understand the true sense of them, or at least that very few can, and that even they few cannot be certain that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them in the right sense, that is, in that sense which God meant them; tho that is improperly said, for it seems God meant them in none, but intended that every man should believe them in what sense he pleases. This he may call a <hi>Latitude of Faith,</hi> but it is such a <hi>Latitude,</hi> that if I should tell any Infidels of it, whom I would convert to Christianity, they would presently laugh at me and my Faith too.</p>
            <p>But in the second place <hi>God is the Author of a Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 31.</note> 
               <hi>in giving to men, as he sees fit, such measures of knowledge and persuasion, as leaves them in a higher or lower degree of Faith, and even of Holiness.</hi> This is impious; for in the true consequence of it he charges not only all the Heresies, but all the Infidelity in the world on God Almighty, and justifies both their Heresies and their Infidelity by the different degrees and measures of Faith, or by the No-Faith which God gives them; but I am not at leisure to dispute this now, for it does not concern our present purpose. But if our Author would say any thing either in defence of what he pleads for, or against what the Dean maintains, he must show that Christians are not obliged to profess and believe <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> Truth; that agreeing in <hi>Scripture-words,</hi> tho understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in contrary Senses, is sufficient to make Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Christians; that we must not defend the true Faith against such as oppose it, especially if they, or any <hi>Peaceable men</hi> for them, pretend that they <hi>believe as they can, and as by Grace they are able</hi>; and that the Church must not require an open and undisguised Profession of the True Faith.</p>

If the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity</hi> be the <hi>Imposition</hi> only of <hi>Dictating men,</hi> let him prove that, and we will no longer desire him or any man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. But if it be the plain truth of the Gospel, we will desire him to believe it, and think the Church has Authority enough to require him to do it, though <hi>the Church can't make that an Article of Faith which God has not made so:</hi> For I hope she can require the profession of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50617:19"/>
that which God has made so, and that is all we desire.<note place="margin">P. 31.</note>
               <hi>But in Controversies the Church may declare her Sense, and we are bound so far peaceably to submit and accept it, as not to contradict it or teach contrary, under Penalty of her Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</hi> A very bountiful Concession, for which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves her publick Thanks, if he will but stay for them <hi>till a fit Time and Place. And this he would be content</hi> (I doubt it not) <hi>to conceive the whole of what our Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, as to these things, which are merely her Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> Now who can tell what he means by <hi>merely her Determinations</hi>? for I never heard that the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered any Doctrines, especially the Creeds, as merely her Determinations, which would be indeed with a bare face to impose upon the Faith of Christians; but she never pretended to make a Faith, but to teach that Faith which was <hi>once delivered to the Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But does he really think the Church desires no man to believe the Creeds, and particularly the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity,</hi> but only not to oppose them? Doth she indeed hand them to us <hi>merely as her</hi> own <hi>Determinations</hi>? Can any thinking man say so? But if this were all, Do our <hi>Socinians</hi> observe this? Why does not he first persuade them to comply thus far, before he desires us not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Church's Doctrine?</p>
            <p>But let us hear his profound Reason; <hi>For in truth it is to no purpose for her to require such Approbation and Consent, which whether paid or no, she can never come to have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of which sort is Belief and inward Approbation.</hi> Is it then to no purpose to teach men the Truth, because they may put upon us, and say they believe it when they do not? Is it to no purpose to require men to profess their minds sincerely, because we cannot always be sure whether they do or no? This is admirable Logick. We must then never administer an Oath, because we can't
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50617:20"/>
tell for all that, whether the person speaks the real truth or no. But if this be true, there is no need of disputing a Latitude of Faith, for men may take this Latitude whether we will or no.</p>
            <p>But <hi>to exact this may breed Hypocrisy</hi>; not if his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Faith be allowed, for then men may sincerely profess their Faith in any Words which have Latitude enough to excuse from Hypocrisy, which, if we will believe him, all words have, whether found in Scripture, or used by the Ancient Church. But must nothing be done, from whence bad men may take occasion to be Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites? Then I am sure Vertue must not be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor Vice punished, because some may hence take occasion to counterfeit Virtue when they are not sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly virtuous. And I hope he will not say, That requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an <hi>inward Belief</hi> makes men <hi>Hypocrites</hi> any other ways; it is not design'd for that end, it does not command nor force men to be <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and if men will be <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi> who can help it? Nay, certainly if our Church required only his <hi>Peaceable Submission</hi> in what she teaches of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> she might be more justly accused of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging <hi>Hypocrisy.</hi> For what else would it be, to oblige men daily to worship the <hi>Trinity,</hi> when she does not suppose nor desire them to believe any such thing, and to profess their Faith in Three Persons, when they do not believe one word of that Doctrine? <hi>But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Seed of Charity and Christian Concord to exact this inward Belief.</hi> But I think 'tis great Charity to the Souls of men to exact such a Faith as is necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; as for Charity to the Bodies of men, writing against their Heresies breaks no bones. And if by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> he means an Unity of Faith, which is the only <hi>Concord</hi> we are now concern'd about, such a <hi>Latitude</hi> as admits of Twenty several sorts of Faith, can't be

this <hi>Concord</hi>; and whenever there is such a <hi>Concord,</hi> as an universal Liberty of Faith signifies, which can be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Civil and Political <hi>Concord,</hi> I desire him to tell me, whether ever he found a greater Unity in the Faith, or less disputing for it.</p>

            <p>As for what he quotes out of the <hi>Nouvelles de la Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publique des Lettres,</hi> if it signify any thing more than to let us know he understands <hi>French,</hi> it must be to warn the world against <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> who it seems are very busy in corrupting the Faith with their Notions of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Quantities</hi>: I never saw the Book, and am not <hi>Mathematician</hi> enough to be a proper Judge of it; and therefore must refer it to Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> who i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Dean, he tells us, demands of him, <hi>Would he believe such absurd Doctrines as some represent the Trinity in Vnity to be, merely upon Church-Authority</hi>? To which he returns an Answer, by which 'tis not easy to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what he means. He says,<note place="margin">P. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now as for such <hi>forms of speaking, as</hi>

only from <hi>Church-Authority,</hi> and would have those who defend them (which I think he does not care to do) urge nothing else. <hi>The Fathers</hi> indeed, good men, <hi>thought the sense of these words was in Scripture,</hi> and <hi>so doth he, admitting what we judge good Consequents out of Scripture, to be of the same truth with Scripture</hi>; but poor man he confesses he is not able to prove it, nor <hi>to convince others who do not think so</hi>; and because he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not convince them, he thinks no body else can; which may be true, if he knows his men to be convinced; for some men will never be convinced, and some others have as little mind to convince them. But he goes on, <hi>Demonstrate to the world this to be the Sense of Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But when he calls upon us to <hi>demonstrate this,</hi> I hope he does not mean Mathematical Demonstrations, unless he has a mind to trepan us into the <hi>Nouvelles</hi>; and as for any other Demonstrations, if he cannot give them, others can, if he will secure them from his <hi>Earnest Suits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, but if we can't <hi>demonstrate this, we must own this to be the state of our Evidence. We have for the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox side, Scripture interpreted by the Tradition of the Church: This at length resolves it self mainly into Church-Authority.</hi> This were true, if there were no other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way of knowing the true Sense of Scripture, but Church-Authority; for this sets aside Scripture, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves all at last into Church-Authority; and he himself has made that too contemptible to be a sure Foundation for Faith; but the Scripture was so writ by the Divine Penmen, as to be understood; and tho a Traditionary
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50617:22"/>
Sense of Scripture be a very good Confirmation of what according to the ordinary rules of expounding Scripture, appears to be the true and genuine Sense of it, yet no Authority ought so far to over-rule us, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> persuade us to believe that to be the true Sense of Scripture, which neither the usual signification of the words, nor the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of the place, nor the contexture of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning proves to be so. And this was the Question he ought to have Answered the Dean, Whether he would have believed such things as the <hi>Socinians</hi> say are very Contradictions and <hi>Absurd,</hi> and which he himself does not say, are not <hi>absurd, merely upon Authority,</hi> though this Authority pretends Scripture without any Reason to be on its side.</p>
            <p>But still he has a farther fetch, which the Dean was so dull as not to smell out, nor I believe would any man else, though he had <hi>attended his words</hi> never so <hi>strictly</hi>; and it is this, that some other <hi>Concurrent Power</hi> should be called in to end this Controversy, I suppose, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing silence on all Parties, This carries a show of greater impartiality than our Author usually expresses, for then the <hi>Socinians,</hi> as well as the <hi>Orthodox,</hi> must have their hands tied up. But I doubt this is not such a very fair proposal, when 'tis thoroughly considered; for this must not be done till the Hereticks are first gratified, and <hi>the Forms of Worship, which some mens Consciences can't bear, made easy,</hi> that is, <hi>the Doctrine of the Trinity</hi> thrown out of the Liturgy; thank him for his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Civility to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And then <hi>no matter how severe the Laws be against any who shall write or speak more in the Controversy</hi>; that is, I suppose, every man shall be punished who shall presume to speak one word for as well as against the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and pretend to teach any such Doctrine; for saying any thing of it, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>But to proceed with our Author, he professes a great Reverence for the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> (whether in earnest or in jest let the Reader judge) and speaks a great many fine things in behalf of it, not worth repeating. And then he falls foul upon <hi>Athanasius</hi> and his Disputations, taking a hint from what the Dean said concerning <hi>his Learned and Subtil Disputations, which confounded the Arians</hi>; of which this Author <hi>for brevities s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to what other purpose all this Account serves, he may guess that can; for my part I see so little in it, that I think it time lost to consider it any farther. For I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how it proves, that <hi>the Council of</hi> Nice <hi>did rely chiefly on Authority,</hi> as our Author asserts; and that <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>heir Faith was not</hi> (as the Dean says it was) <hi>resolved into Scripture and Reason.</hi> When he shows how his Story will prove <hi>this,</hi> which was the thing in debate, I will seriously consider his Quotations, but in the mean time I shall leave him to read his History-Lectures to the walls, and pass on a Page or two farther, where we shall meet with a Masterpiece of Wit and Reason, in some Learned Remarks on the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed, which may
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50617:23"/>
well enough divert a Reader who is disposed for a little Mirth, but will signify little to one that has a mind to be Serious.</p>
            <p>But however,<note place="margin">p. 39.</note> he <hi>cannot forbear an instance or two o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t of that Creed,</hi> to shew how apt that Creed is to lead men <hi>to mistake the Truth, and to prosess Heresies and Blasphemy.</hi> I suppose this was meant for an instance to show <hi>his Tenderness for the Church of England,</hi> who owns and embraces this Creed. He has found out a way, (and as far as I know, the Glory of the Invention may be all his own) to prove from <hi>this Creed,</hi> that Two of the Three Persons are not Eternal, but Created, because there is <hi>but One Eternal and One Vncreated,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 39.</note> 
               <hi>and therefore Two of the Three must be Created</hi>; tho the Creed expresly says of each of the Three Persons, That he is Eternal and Uncreated. Any man, I think, would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hence conclude, That these Three are One Eternal and One Uncreated, than that Two of the Three are <hi>not Eternal.</hi> And I dare venture any man for making such a mistake, tho he hath a less <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Head than our Author,<note place="margin">p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>And now he tells us, <hi>Therefore</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> because of what has been said) <hi>he had reason, as to the Doctrine of the Trinity, not to go beyond the Decisions of the Councils, but to acquiesce in their Authorities</hi>; as if that were all he had urged, when 'tis plain that he affirm'd, That <hi>it was Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority that chiefly carried the Point</hi> in these Councils, and would have us urge nothing but their bare Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in defence of our Faith; and whether from what he has said, there be reason for us thus to expose our selves for Fools to our Adversaries, I leave every one to judge, who knows what Reason means. So that the Dean's
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50617:24"/>
question was very pertinent, and still retains its first force, for I would fain see this Author show us any man of sense, who <hi>would believe such absurd Doctrines, as the</hi> Socinians <hi>represent the Trinity in Vnity to be, merely upon Church Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What farther Authority beyond that of the Church inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>he has no mind to speak</hi>: But I think what he does speak, does plainly enough insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, that it was not Reason nor Scripture, but Human Force, which carried it, and <hi>determined the Point</hi> in that Council; and would any man who did not intend to expose both the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith and Council too, insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate this? Let the Dean then be as charitable as he will in his Opinion, I am hard to believe that this was writ with any other design than to expose the Doctrine of the Trinity, and the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well as the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which no doubt is much behold<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to him, because he would not speak all he knew of it, but leave every one to suspect the worst. And after the same manner I find he is willing to oblige the Dean;<note place="margin">p. 41.</note> for <hi>he will also pass by here, as small faults, some Blunders of Mr. Dean</hi>'s; but not without naming them, for fear the Reader should be so dull as not to apprehend them without notice. One of them, or rather All, is, That he <hi>makes St. Athanasius, St. Hilary,</hi> and <hi>St. Basil</hi> (tho I cannot find either <hi>Hilary</hi> or <hi>Athanasius</hi> named by the Dean in that <hi>huddle of Fathers) to write largely against those Heresies which former Councils had condemned; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they all three died when there had but yet one Council sat.</hi> This <hi>Blunder</hi> may, I hope, pass indeed but for a <hi>small Fault,</hi> or rather, as I take it, for none at all: For as to <hi>Hilary,</hi> he is not mentioned by the Dean; and then for <hi>Athanasius,</hi> the Dean a line or two before that <hi>huddle of Fathers</hi> that sticks in our Author's throat, says of him,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50617:24"/>
that <hi>he wrote against the</hi> Arians <hi>after they were condemned by the Council of</hi> Nice, which I hope is no <hi>Blunder.</hi> And then if St. <hi>Basil</hi> did dye after <hi>one Council only had sat,</hi> did not the rest there named live and write after more Councils than one had sat? And therefore if some here named writ after one Council, and others after two or more, what <hi>Blunder</hi> is it to say in general, <hi>They writ against Heresies which former Councils had condemned</hi>? Is not this agreeable to the common form of speech? And yet it may be they might write against some things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by more Councils than one, tho not General ones. But however, these Fathers, he says, <hi>are imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently cited against him</hi>; this I am sure is <hi>impertinently</hi> said; for 'tis evident enough, that what they are cited for, is directly contrary to what he would persuade us to, for <hi>they wrote against Heresies condemned by former C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>uncils,</hi> and that it is for which the Dean cites them; and the <hi>Antapologist,</hi> if I can tell what to make of his Arguments, has all this while been persuading us not to write against the <hi>Antitrinitarians,</hi> because they were condemned by former Councils: Now on which side the <hi>Impertinency</hi> lies, let any other <hi>Stander by</hi> judge. <hi>And thus much,</hi> and more than enough, <hi>as to his adhesion to the Authority of these Councils</hi>; which I can make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else of, but that he would have nothing added to the Determinations of these Councils. But all this while how does this prove, That <hi>Authority chiefly carried the Point,</hi> or that we may not write in defence of what these Councils have determined?</p>
            <p>And now our Author after all this tedious Harangue should come to vindicate his <hi>Reasons</hi> from those Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the <hi>Apologist</hi> has made against them; but that is a Task which does not agree so well with him: He He has not, I suppose, Leisure and <hi>Books enough about

him,</hi> being <hi>so many miles from his Study</hi>; and <hi>his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saria for the</hi> proper <hi>Month,</hi> it may be, are not at hand; and therefore let his Reasons shift for themselves as well as they can these hard times.</p>
            <p>As to his Reflections on the Dean (to whom he now wholly applies what he had formerly said in general, against all who write in Defence of the <hi>True Faith,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But now this Controversy is like to be at an end; for says our Author,<note place="margin">p. 43.</note> 
               <hi>Now I may set my heart at rest as to this Controversy, if Mr. Dean will stand to the profession he has made, That all that any man that he) pretends to in Vindicating the Doctrine of the Trinity, is to prove that this Faith is taught in Scripture. This,</hi> our Author adds, <hi>is that which he would be at.</hi> And yet I fear the Dean and he would not be at the same thing: The Dean would have it, and has proved it, That the Doctrine of <hi>Three Persons</hi> and <hi>One</hi> God, is contained in Scripture.

with this Controversy. This was the design of his Book, to persuade us not to meddle with this Controversy, but to leave every man to take the words of Scripture in what sense he pleases; and this I take to be different from the Dean's design of <hi>proving this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be contain'd in Scripture</hi>; and so the Dean's own <hi>Profession,</hi> tho he stand to it, will not bring the business so near a Compromise.

            <p>But after all, he has not fairly represented the Dean's words, but has stopped where he thought fit; as if the Dean had only said, <hi>That all any man pretended to, was to prove that this Faith is taught in Scripture</hi>; whereas he went farther, and added, <hi>and that it contains no such Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities and Contradictions, as should force a wise man to reject it,</hi> &amp;c This, I doubt, the <hi>Stander-by</hi> does not love to hear of, That there is no <hi>Absurdity,</hi> no <hi>Contradi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the next Page <hi>he proceeds to account for his last reason he assign'd for the present Vnreasonableness of some mens agitating this Controversy:</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 44.</note> He should have cleared his <hi>Accounts</hi> as he went along, and said something more to the purpose in justification of his other Reasons, before he came to the last; but it may be he has a good excuse, and therefore we will be contented to attend his motions.

That to vindicate the Doctrine of the Trinity against</hi> Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, <hi>will make men Atheists.</hi> Now I desire any man to look upon his words, and see if it be not so; for he addresses his <hi>Suit</hi> to All who write in <hi>Vindication of the Trinity,</hi> to forbear writing; and to this purpose he tells them 'tis <hi>unreasonable</hi> to <hi>controvert</hi> this Point; and the Reason he brings to prove his Assertion,<note place="margin">

Why did he not plainly say, he was not against mens writing in Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity, but that he only disliked <hi>Dr</hi> Sherlock'<hi>s Vindication?</hi> But whatever the <hi>Doctor's Vindication</hi> will do, I am sure our <hi>Antapolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist</hi>s Politick Method for men to agree in the bare sound of words, and no body to know what they mean by them, or to take them in opposite and contradictory Senses, would expose us and our Faith to the just Scorn of Atheists and Scepticks, who by the same Art might subscribe all the Articles of the Christian Creed, and yet believe never a word of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>In the next Section he comes to the <hi>Secret, which the Dean told him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 19. p. 45.</note> That <hi>Atheists and Deists, Men who are for no Religion, are of late very Zealous Socinians</hi>; and which the Dean urges as a good reason why we should at present be Zealous against <hi>Socinanism,</hi> and so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50617:26"/>
it is, and a far better than any <hi>he</hi> has urged to the contrary. For the truth of the matter of Fact, 'tis notoriously known, and needs no proof. To invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date this Argument, I can't find that he has said one word; but instead of this, (according to his usual way of Digressions) he puts off the Reader with an Account of his Friendship and Acquaintance, which he holds with no <hi>Atheists</hi> nor <hi>Deists,</hi> but only with some <hi>Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Rationalists</hi>; and that his <hi>Virtuous Rationalists do not ridicule this Faith.</hi> This <hi>Virtuous Rationalist,</hi> is a new Name, and I'am afraid signifies, either a <hi>Deist,</hi> or a <hi>Socinian,</hi> for other Men are not ashamed of their known Characters, and if they do not ridicule the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, no thanks to their good Nature, nor to their good Manners; they do their best, as he has done, to ridicule it; but it is a Doctrine that won't be ridicul'd.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the unreasonableness of this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy about the Holy Trinity. In the next place he objects the <hi>Danger</hi> of it; and his Argument for that, is, That it is a <hi>Fundamental</hi> of our Religion: <hi>Now to litigate concerning a Fundamental, is to turn it into a Controversy; that is, to unsettle, at least endanger the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setling the whole Superstructure.</hi> Now, in Answer to this, the Dean had proved, That there was very great reason to dispute and settle <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> when Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks endeavour to unsettle them; and ask'd this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Whether the Being of a God were not a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental? And whether that were a good reason not to dispute for the Being of a God, because Atheists deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it? This made him ashamed to own his Argument, and therefore he charges the Dean with misrepresenting it. His pretended Misrepresentation is, that he did not say, That the Doctrine of the Trinity was a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental in general, but only, <hi>if duly stated,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50617:27"/>
not a Fundamental, as unduly stated by the Dean. This is so trifling an Evasion, that it is hardly worth the while to expose it. Was the dispute, whether the Dean should write in defence of the Doctrine of the Trinity, or whether the Doctrine of the Trinity should be defended? Was his Argument urged to prove that it was <hi>dangerous</hi> for the Dean, whom he never named before, to defend the Doctrine of the Trinity by his mistaken Notion of it, or that it was <hi>dangerous</hi> to dispute a <hi>Fundamental?</hi> To show the fol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>y of this pretence, let us put his Argument into Mode and Figure, wherein his <hi>Fundamental</hi> Doctrine of the Trinity, <hi>as duly stated,</hi> can be only the <hi>minor</hi> Proposition.
<list type="syllogism">
                  <item>'Tis dangerous to litigate touching a Fundamental, or to turn a Fundamental into a Controversy.</item>
                  <item>But the Doctrine of the Trinity, as duly stated, is a Fundamental:</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'Tis dangerous to litigate touching the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, as duly stated.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now if he will not allow the <hi>Major</hi> Proposition, his Argument is nothing; and if he will, then the Force of his Argument consists in the danger of disputing Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> seems the Dean placed the Force of his Argument right; and if that Argument be good, it is as good against disputing for the Being of a God against Atheists; for the Being of a God is as Fundamental as the Doctrine of the Trinity. So that this limitation of <hi>duly stated,</hi> does not at all concern this Argument of disputing about the Trinity; but the Argument only prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s, that we must not dispute about the Doctrine of the Trinity, <hi>as duly stated,</hi> because it is a <hi>Fundamental,</hi> and I suppose, whenever we talk of defending the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we mean it <hi>as duly stated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:50617:27"/>But tho the <hi>Stander-by</hi> would not allow any man to defend <hi>Fundamentals,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 31.</note> yet our worthy Primate being not under his Jurisdiction, has ventured to do it. This was then News to him, and <hi>welcome Tidings too,</hi> if we may believe him; and he pretends also to pay great Deference to his Authority, tho one would hardly guess so by the Lash he gives him for Licensing by his Chaplain the Dean's Apology. But what has he to answer this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? Why, he hopes in <hi>that Piece to find</hi> (as I hope too by this time he has) <hi>plain and perspicuous Scripture-Notions, clear Reason,</hi> and <hi>genuine Antiquity.</hi> Will this justify the writing of that Piece? If so, then 'tis not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,</hi> nor <hi>unseasonable,</hi> nor <hi>dangerous,</hi> to write in defence of <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and even of the <hi>Doctrine of the Trinity</hi>; but farther, <hi>he was capacitated by his Publick Station,</hi> &amp;c. Very well: And if that will justify him, why will not his approving the <hi>Apology,</hi> justify the Dean at least in writing that Book? And why may not his <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicacion</hi> be as well justified by the Approbation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was also <hi>capacitated by his Publick Station,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>to write,</hi> or to License other men to write <hi>on this Subject?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His last Argument is the <hi>Vnseasonableness</hi> of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy; he says, <hi>All Controversies among Protestants are now unseasonable</hi>; the Dean adds somewhat more, that <hi>they are always so; for there is no Juncture seasonable to broach Heresies and oppose the Truth.</hi> To this he answers, That there may be <hi>Controversies among Protestants, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Heresy</hi>; but it is not easy to conceive any Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy, but that one side or other must oppose the Truth; and this I believe the Dean thinks always <hi>Vnseasonable</hi>; but the present Dispute was about Fundamental Articles, and therefore he had very good reason to mention only the <hi>Vnseasonableness of broaching Heresies.</hi> And he seems
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50617:28"/>
to me to urge a very good Argument why no Juncture can be unseasonable to defend the Truth when 'tis op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd; <hi>For if Hereticks will dispute against the Truth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably, there is no time unseasonable to defend Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths.</hi> But can any thing be more pleasant than his Proof of the Seasonableness of some Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, he might have said of all, even of <hi>Socinianism</hi> it self, in all Junctures, from the University-Exercises in the Divinity-Schools, where men who are all of a mind dispute with one another, not to oppose the Truth, but to learn how to defend it against the common Enemy when occasion serves? He might as well have proved that Civil Wars are not always unseasonable, because 'tis never unseasonable for Fellow-Citizens to learn the use of their Arms in a Martial Scene, without Bloodshed.</p>
            <p>But his Argument why it is so unseasonable in this Juncture, is this, Because, <hi>under God, nothing but an Vnion of Counsels, and joining of hands and hearts can preserve the Reformation, and scarce any thing more credit and justify it, than an Vnion in Doctrinals</hi>: Here he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, that the Dean left out somewhat at the latter end, and therefore I will add it, and it is this, <hi>so above all other Controversies none can be well thought of worse timed than this</hi>; let the Reader judge whether this inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Force of his Argument, especially since it was afterwards particularly considered. In answer to this, in the first place the Dean asks, <hi>Is the Vnion in Doctrinals ever the greater, that</hi> Socinians <hi>boldly and publickly affront the Faith of the Church, and no body appears to defend it?</hi> All that he answers to this is, that he does not love Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, especially to the Faith of the Church, and don't know that the <hi>Socinians</hi> affront it, and is sorry for it if they do; it may be he will not allow writing against the Faith, and endeavouring to ridicule it, to be an Affront,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50617:28"/>
which he knew very well the <hi>Socini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ns</hi> did, if he knew that ever the Dean writ against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> which was in Answer to as Prophane and as Scurrilous a Libel as ever was writ: But whether he will allow this to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronting of the Faith or no, I suppose he will allow that it is opposing it; which argues no great <hi>Vnion in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinals,</hi> tho no body should defend it, unless, as the Dean adds, <hi>the world should think we are all of a mind, because there is disputing only on one side, and then they will think us all</hi> Socinians, <hi>as some Foreigners begin alrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>y to suspect; which will be a very scandalous Vnion, and divide us from all other Reform'd Churches.</hi> His Answer to this, (and a very Politick and Grave one it is) as far as I can guess, amounts to this, That if we live good lives, and let our Adversaries alone, the world will credit our <hi>Practice, Articl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s, Homilies,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore think us no <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi> Now if subscribing the Articles be no more than he makes it to be, they cannot conclude us to be no <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> from our <hi>Articles,</hi> because a man may subscribe them, and yet believe never a word of them; in which case the only way to show that we do believe them, is to defend and vindicate them, and then I believe the world will think us no <hi>Socinians</hi>; but otherwise, I fear, <hi>they will,</hi> as the Dean says, <hi>think us all</hi> Socinians, <hi>which will be a very scandalous Vnion</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>As to what he says of <hi>Pamphlets dying away, if they were not opposed</hi>; I am not in all cases of his mind, and see no present prospect of it, especially in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy, which so much gratifies Atheists and Infidels: But if these Heresies would in time dye away of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, which yet I much question, as not finding that false Opinions always lose ground by not being opposed, what must be done in the mean time? must we all pass contentedly for <hi>Socinians</hi> in the eye of the world, and be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50617:29"/>
afraid to say we are none? I believe all men would not think this much for the Glory of the Reformation, nor would the Cause of Religion be much beholding to us for it.</p>
            <p>But his great Argument to prove this Juncture unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to defend the Doctrine of the Trinity is, That it makes sport for Papists; To which the Dean answers, <hi>It must be disputing against the Trinity then, not dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Dean observed farther, that if this Argument to prove the unseasonableness of this Controversy in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Holy Trinity in this juncture, from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Union of Counsels and joining of hands and hearts for the Preservation of the Reformation, have any Force, it must signify, that we shall <hi>never join against a common enemy, whose Successes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ould endanger the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, while there are any Religious Disputes among us; which is a confession that every Schism in the Church is a new Party and Faction in the State, which are always trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to Government when it wants their help.</hi> He seems surpriz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d at this, as not aware of this Consequence, the truth of which he has not Confidence enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nor Reason enough to answer, but only sences a little for his beloved <hi>Socinians,</hi> as a very small inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Party, and so quiet and peaceable in their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that there is no danger of their disturbing Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Now if all this be true, it only proves the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50617:29"/>
of his Argument; for then we may still write against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and yet unite Counsels, and join hands and hearts to preserve the Reformation; <hi>of which the Socini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now passing by some poor trifling reflections,</hi> we must come <hi>to his mind in a passage of more weight</hi>; but pray, What are these <hi>trifling Reflections,</hi> which he is so good natured as to <hi>pass by</hi>? They are only some Reflections on his Answer to an Objection started by himself in these Words, <hi>shall we tamely by a base silence give up the Point</hi>? Of which he tells us there is no danger, for a wise Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>viz. That the Established Church is in possession of it, and the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>versaries of the received Doctrine cannot alter our Articles of Religion.</hi> Now this Answer is apparently weak, and the insufficiency of it is shown by the Dean in a few words, as indeed a few are enow to do it; and I suspect he passes by these Reflections upon a very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable account, because he could not answer them. I shall not therefore trouble my Reader with the Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, nor ask our Author any Question for fear he should say, <hi>I fall on Catechising him,</hi> which possibly will not agree with a man of a <hi>negative Belief.</hi> But it may be the Reader will not be angry, if I ask him a Question or two; Whether because our Articles oblige us to profess our Faith in the Holy Trinity, this be a good reason why we should not defend it? And if the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> as he tells us, <hi>have a Zeal too, no less ardent than that of Church men</hi>; Whether this be a reason why we should by <hi>a base silence</hi> suffer them to spread their Poyson without contradicting them? If <hi>our Author</hi> were to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer this question, I suppose he would in his <hi>Melancholy fit,</hi> say, yes by all means; for if no body Disputes with them, they will leave off Disputing; But will they leave
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50617:30"/>
off Perverting the People? Will they leave off making Proselytes to their Heretical Opinions? Nor do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve after all, that the charms of our Author's <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Suit</hi> and <hi>Peaceable</hi> Rhetorick, would be able to silence them, though no body should Write against them: For why then did they unprovoked make the first Onset; and, as soon as they thought the times would bear it, openly Disperse their envenomed Libels, which I don't question but they would have done sooner, if they had thought it safe: If our Author had told us, they had no <hi>ardent Zeal,</hi> his argument would have been much more to the purpose; for then indeed there would have been more reason to <hi>neglect them,</hi> since there would have been less reason to fear the spreading of the infection.</p>
            <p>Well, but whether they will leave off Disputing or no, 'tis fit we should, and <hi>neglect them till a fit time and place,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ant. p. 51.</note> which is the <hi>weighty passage</hi> that the <hi>Dean</hi> will not <hi>understand</hi>; but however, whether he will <hi>understand</hi> or no, we must wait for <hi>this fit time and place</hi> before we open our Mouths in Defence of the Truth.

For it seems, tho the Dean thought the <hi>present a fit time,</hi> not upon those Reasons which he himself gives, and which our Author has not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, but as our Author, who, I suppose, by this time has got <hi>the gift of discerning Spirits,</hi>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50617:30"/>
of Convocation:</hi> And if we grant this, may not the <hi>present</hi> also be a fit time, till the other can be compass'd, tho not the fittest? <hi>and the fittest persons a Committee cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by that great and reverend Assembly</hi>? Here I had a great mind to be at the old way of Questions; but since he is so afraid of being <hi>catechis'd,</hi> I must, to humour him, put the case <hi>Categorically</hi>; and, besides referring him to what the Dean has already said, tell him what exceptions I have against his Proposals, which I look upon as neither reasonable nor practicable; for certainly there is no great reason why those Doctrines, which have been so long since defined by a <hi>Convocation,</hi> should never be defended against the assaults of scornful Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Opposers, till a <hi>Convocation</hi> can meet and order an Answer to their scandalous Pamphlets, and then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look it again before it goes to the Press. And I think the Authority lodged in the Archbishop and Bishop of <hi>London</hi> to License Books, may be sufficient to justify any man, whom they approve, in Writing in Defence of the Established Doctrine, without waiting for a New Convocation; Or else what was that Authority lodged there for? I hope, not to license Books against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, nor yet merely to license such as do not at all meddle with the Doctrines of our Religion. And if this Authority be sufficient, we know the Dean was thus far Authorized to Write in Defence of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which any one professes are against his Conscience; nor any Rite or Ceremony required, which all men are not satisfied in; and so we must part with Episcopacy, and all Order and Decency, to satisfy mens pretences to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. This is a brave <hi>Protestant Reconciler,</hi> and this is admirable arguing for a Church-of-<hi>England</hi>-man, and one who has read Fathers and Schoolmen.

               <note place="margin">P. 52.</note> The next thing we are to answer is a <hi>Captious Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> with which he pretends to answer the Dean, who as he imagines had put such an one to him.

Why then, <hi>Must they not be obeyed?</hi> Yes. But what of all this? To discourse concerning the Doctrine of the Trinity, is not there prohibited. <hi>But is there not the same reason of it, as of those things that are?</hi> I believe not: For as I take it, the Trinity and Incarnation are more Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Points than the Disputes about Predestination, and more necessary to be believed by Christian People. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Controversy then was not only with such as wholly denied the Article, but among those who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the sense of the Article, while there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contained plainly in the Article, to which both sides agreed, tho some would have more included in it, than others could find, or would allow to be there assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which Controversy Authority saw fit to silence at
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50617:32"/>
that time, since both sides owned the Truth of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, which asserted a <hi>Divine Predestination</hi>; and would not let every one in their Pulpits run into nice, useless, and hurtful questions; nor do we desire this should be allowed in the Doctrine of the Trinity. And when he has Interest enough at Court to procure a <hi>Royal Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that no man shall <hi>write</hi> or <hi>speak</hi> concerning the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, we know what we have to do; but till then, his <hi>Royal Injunctions</hi> are no more to the purpose than his own Arguments. But however, he will not stand with us for this Point,<note place="margin">P. 53.</note> for <hi>notwithstanding this, he yields that Ministers should at due season preach to their people the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Trinity and Incarnation; only let them do it plainly, easily, purely, and sincerely, according to Scripture, and not with Innovations of their own.</hi> This, if he be <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> in what he says, is all we desire; and if he will promise never to revoke this Grant, we will be satisfied.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50617:33"/>
not worth it: For it doth by no means reach the Point, which isc Whether the Governors of the Church ought to make the Terms of Communion so large, as that known professed <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> may fully communicate with us as compleat and Orthodox Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church; and not, as our Author gravely puts it, Whether <hi>every Preacher should stop when he sees a</hi> Socinian <hi>come into the Church.</hi> Besides, he supposes his <hi>Socinian</hi> to be a known <hi>good liver, and professing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Christianity</hi>; but it may be we may not agree with him; and suppose I should not be so happy as to think so well of his <hi>Socinian</hi> Friend as he doth, will he then give me leave to turn him out of the Church? But what is all this to the Publick Constitutions of a Church, and the Laws of Communion? Must they be made so loose as to admit all sorts of Hereticks, because an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick of any sort may sometimes appear at least to be a <hi>good liver,</hi> and <hi>profess to believe the Common Christiani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty,</hi> &amp;c. as there have been such Professors of other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, and may be of any as well as of this? If our Author answers this too with a <hi>Why not?</hi> I desire he will subjoin a Reason for what he says, and then he may deserve a Reply.</p>
            <p>And now our great Champion of wrong'd Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, out of his extraordinary Generosity, and <hi>love of Peace and Truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 54.</note> 
               <hi>cannot forbear observing,</hi> that the Dean wrongs the poor innocent <hi>Socinians,</hi> and <hi>imputes sundry Points very iniquitously stated, to them, which yet they hold not as he states them</hi> And first he tells us, <hi>If he</hi> (the Dean) <hi>as some in the world, had had Personal Dealing with the generality of his Parishioners as to matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, he would say, That the Ignorance of many Church-people, and so the Errors of their Conceptions touching God and the Three Persons in the Godhead, much more alter
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50617:33"/>
(as to them) the Object of the Christian Worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dean, I believe, tho not so unacquainted with his Parishioners, while he had a Parish, yet never met with such Ignorance as this; and yet no man doubts but there are some persons very ignorant, who have no distinct Conceptions of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but yet have no Heretical Opinions about them; and I wonder this <hi>Stander-by,</hi> who is so fond of a <hi>Negative Belief,</hi> should not see a difference between a <hi>Negative</hi> Orthodoxy, and professed positive Heresy. By the same Argument he might as well prove, that all other Hereticks ought to be received into the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Christian Church, because there are a great many Christians that are extremely ignorant in all other Points of Faith. But tho a general, confused, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Knowledge, with a sober and pious Conversation, may qualify men for Christian Communion, yet profest Hereticks ought to be flung out of the Church. The first are the Churches Care to instruct them better, as Opportunity and their Capacities will admit; the others are her profest Enemies, and must be removed from the Church, to preserve the sound parts from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and I can t imagine what Notion a man can have of Church-Communion, without Unity of Faith; tho the same Communion may admit of very different degrees of Knowledge.</p>
            <p>It would be too tedious, and not very pertinent here, to run thorough these things; but I am sure, for all his haste, the Dean has not in this place imputed any thing to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> but what they avowedly and in Print main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; for it is evident that the <hi>Socinians</hi> do deny the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>Meritorious Intercession</hi> of our Saviour; that they do also deny that the <hi>Eternal</hi> Son of God Offered himself; that God demonstrated his <hi>Love</hi> to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50617:34"/>
us by sending his <hi>own Son</hi> in a proper sense, as opposed to a mere Man, or Created Spirit; and consequently, they do deny the <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Condescension</hi> of the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Son of God, in becoming Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore these things are not <hi>iniquitously</hi> imputed to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> which yet are the very things which the <hi>Dean</hi>'s Discourse imputes to them; and therefore he has no reason to add, <hi>That some men Write against them without understanding them</hi>; but I am afraid 'tis too true, That some men Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logize for them without understanding th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Socinians</hi> altering the Object of Religious Worship, I refer the Reader to that Discourse of the Dean's, to which he himself has referr'd in his Apology, where he will find that point more largely handled, and fully and clearly Proved.</p>
            <p>But now we come to a great Point,<note place="margin">Ant. p. 55. Sect. 25.</note> and which takes up a great many Pages in our Author, about the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Parliaments, Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Convocations</hi>; on which Head I have some good Reasons not to be so large, and to desire the Reader's excuse, if I do not follow our Author in all he says on this Subject; especially, since our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per business doth not require it, and therefore I do not care to ramble like <hi>him,</hi> unless I had the same advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as he has, to be on the securer side.

            <p>But we must not pass by his Reflections on the <hi>Dean</hi>'s <hi>wonted Civility,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 54.

man that thought that he had either Sense, or Sincerity, or Modesty, could imagine that he had ever seen it, but was imposed upon by hear-say, or by a hasty conclusion, that because it was an Act of Indulgence to Dissenters, it must certainly Indulge the Innocent and true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>Socinians</hi> among the rest. This would have been his best excuse, and much more allowable than still to stand to it, That <hi>other Dissenters have benefit by that Act who do not renounce Soci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ct, or the design of those who made it. And I am sure this Melancholy Dream of a <hi>tacit Conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi> is a very <hi>scandalous representation of the Bishops</hi> and of the whole <hi>Parliament</hi>; for this is to tolerate Atheism, Deism, and Profaneness, and to give men free Liberty, not only to be of what Religion they will, but of none at all, if they like that better. But then, <hi>What do you think of a tacit Connivance quietly to come to our Congregations?</hi> This I think is no new favour, but what was always openly allowed to all who were not Excommunicate, and is very far from a <hi>Tacit</hi> Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then for his <hi>Vetuit inquiri,</hi> I wonder where he will find it, there is no such thing in the Act, and I believe any

Lawyer will satisfy him, that what Law was in force against <hi>Socinianism</hi> before, is so still, and the same <hi>Inquisition</hi> may be made after them; but if any, whose business it is to discover such Offenders, or punish them when known, will neglect their Duty, 'tis their <hi>Connivance</hi> and not the Law that affords Impunity.</p>
            <p>But I wonder what makes him Dream of a <hi>tacit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance</hi> for <hi>Socinians,</hi> because they are expresly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is just as if he should say, the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> give a <hi>tacit Connivance</hi> to them, because they require every man to renounce their <hi>Errors,</hi> and to Confess his Faith in the Holy Trinity.
