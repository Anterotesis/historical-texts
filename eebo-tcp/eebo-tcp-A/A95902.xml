            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or the firſt, which is to know what Chyrurgerie is. Herein J doe note the ſaying of <hi>Lanfranke,</hi> whereas hee ſaith; All things that man would know, may be knowne by one of theſe three things: That is to ſay, by his Name, or by his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:121645:10"/>
Working; or elſe by his very being and ſhewing of his owne Properties. So then it followeth, that in the ſame manner we may know what Chyrurgery is, by three things. Firſt, by his Name, as thus: the Interpreters write, that Chirurgerie is derived out of theſe words.</p>
               <q>Apo tes chiros, cai tou ergou<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </q>
               <p>That is to be underſtood: A hand-working, and ſo it may be taken for all handy Arts: But Noble <hi>Hypocrates</hi> ſaith, that Chirurgerie is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working in Mans body, for the very end and profit of Chirurgerie is hand-working.</p>
               <p>Now the ſecond manner of knowing what thing Chyrurgerie it, it is the ſaying of <hi>Avicen;</hi> To be knowne by his Being, for it is verily a Medicinall Science. And as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, He that will know the certainty of a thing, let him not buſie himſelfe to know onely the name of that thing, but alſo the working and the effect of the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Now the third way to know what thing Chirurgerie is, it is alſo to be knowne by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or declaring of his own Properties, the which teacheth us to worke in mans Body with hands, as thus: In cutting and opening thoſe parts that be whole, and in healing thoſe parts that be broken or cut, and in taking away that that is ſuperfluous, as Warts, Wennes, Skurfulas, and other of like effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:121645:10"/>
But further, to declare what <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith Chirurgery is, it is the laſt Inſtrument of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: that is to ſay, Dyet, Potion, and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery: of the which three ſaith he, Dyet is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt, and the moſt vertuous: and thus he ſaith. Whereas a man may be cured with Diet onely, let there be given no manner of Medicine. The ſecond Inſtrument, is Potion: for and if a man may be cured with Diet and Potion, let there not be miniſtred any Chirurgery, through whoſe vertue and goodneſſe, is removed and put away many grievous Infirmities and Diſeaſes, which might not have beene removed nor yet put away, neither with Diet nor with Potion. And by theſe three meanes, it is knowne what thing Chirurgery is. And this ſufficeth us for that point.</p>
               <p>Now it is knowne what thing Chirurgerie is, there muſt alſo be choſen a Man apt and meete to miniſter Chirurgery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to be a Chirurgion. And in this point all Authors doe agree, that a Chirurgion ſhould be choſen by his Complexion, and that his complexion bee very temperate, and all his members well proportioned. For <hi>Raſis</hi> ſaith: Whoſe face is not ſeemely, it is vnpoſſible for him to have good manners. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> the great Philoſpher, writeth in his Epiſtles to the Noble King <hi>Alexander)</hi> as in thoſe Epiſtles

more plainly doth appeare) how he ſhould chooſe all ſuch perſons as ſhould ſerve him, by the forme and ſhape of the face, and all other members of the body. And furthermore they ſay, hee that is of an evill Complexion, there muſt needs follow like Conditions.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it agreeth, that he that will take upon him to practice as a Chyrurgion, muſt be both of a good and temperate Complexion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as is afore rehearſed: and principally, that he be a good liver, and a keeper of the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, of whom commeth all cunning and grace, and that his body be not quaking, and his hands ſtedfaſt, his fingers long and ſmall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not trembling: and that his left hand be as ready as his right, with all his limmes, able to fulfill the good work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of the ſoule. Now as here is a man meete to be made a Chirurgion: (and though he have all thoſe good qualities before rehearſed) yet is he no good Chirurgion, but a man very fit and meete for the practice.</p>
               <p>Now then to know what Properties and conditions this man muſt have before he be a perfect Chirurgion. J doe note foure things moſt ſpecially, that every Chirurgion ought for to have: The firſt, that he be Learned: The ſecond, that he be Expert: The third, that he be Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:121645:11"/>
The fourth, that he be well mannered.</p>
               <p>The firſt (J ſaid) he ought to be learned, and that he know his principles, not onely in Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, but alſo in Phyſicke, that he may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defend his Chirurgery; alſo hee ought to be ſeene in naturall Philoſophy, and in Grammar, that he ſpeake congruity in Logicke, that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth him to prove his proportions with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: In Rhetoricke, that teacheth him to ſpeake ſeemely and eloquently: alſo in Theoricke, that teacheth him to know things naturall, and not naturall, and things againſt Nature. Alſo he muſt know the <hi>Anatomie:</hi> for all Authors write againſt thoſe Chirurgions that worke in mans body, not knowing the Anatomy: For they be likened to a blind man, that cutteth in a Vine tree, for he taketh more or leſſe then he ought to doe. And here note well the ſayings of <hi>Galen,</hi> the Prince of Philoſophers, in his <hi>Eſtoris,</hi> That it is as poſſible for a Chyrurgion (not knowing the Anatomy) to worke in mans body without error, as it is for a blind man to carve an Jmage and make it perfect. The ſecond, J ſaid, he muſt be expert: For <hi>Raſus</hi> ſaith: He ought to know and to ſee other men worke, and after to have uſe and exerciſe. The third, that he be ingenious and witty: for all things belonging to Chirurgery may not be written<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:121645:12"/>
ſet forth. The fourth, J ſaid, that he muſt be well mannered, and that he have all theſe good conditions here following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that he be no Spouſe-breaker, nor no Drunkard. For the Philoſophers ſay, amongſt all other things, beware of thoſe perſons that follow Drunkenneſſe, for they be accounted for no men, becauſe they live a life beſtiall: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore amongſt all other ſorts of people, they ought to bee ſequeſtred from the miniſtring of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. Likewiſe, a Chirurgion muſt take heed that he deceive no man with his vaine promiſes, for to make of a ſmall matter a great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe he would be accounted the more famous. And amongſt other things, they may neither be Flatterers nor Mockers, nor privie Back-biters of other men. Likewiſe, they muſt not be Proud, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous: nor detracters of other men. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they ought not to be Covetous, nor no niggard, and namely amongſt their friends, or men of Worſhip, but let them be honeſt, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and free both in word and deed. Likewiſe, they ſhall give no counſell except they be asked, and then give their advice by good deliberation, and that they be well adviſed before they ſpeake, chiefly in the preſence of wiſe men. Likewiſe, they muſt be as privie and as ſecret as any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, of all things that they ſhall either heare or

They ſhall never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort their Patient, and ſhall command all that be about him that they doe the ſame, but to his friends ſpeake truth as the caſe ſtandeth. They muſt alſo be bold in thoſe things whereof they be certaine, and as dreadfull in all perils. They may not chide with the Sicke, but be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes pleaſant and merry.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd if it bee asked you how many ſimple Members there be, it is to be anſwered, Eleven, and two that be but ſuperfluities of Members: and theſe be they, Bones, Cartil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, Nerves, Pannicles, Ligaments, Cordes, Arteirs, Veynes, Fatneſſe, Fleſh and Skinne: and the ſuperfluities bee the Haires and Nailes. J ſhall begin at the Bone, becauſe it is the Foundation and the hardeſt Member of all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Body. The Bone is a conſimile Member, ſimple and ſpermaticke, and cold and dry of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, inſenſible, and inflexible: and hath divers formes in Mans body, for the diverſity of helpings. The cauſe why there be many Bones in mans body, is this: Sometime it is needfull that one member or one limbe ſhould move with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out another: another cauſe is, that ſome defend the principall Members, as both the Bone of the Breſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of the Head: and ſome to bee the Foundation of divers parts of the Body, as the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:121645:14"/>
Bones of the ridge and of the Legges: and ſome to fulfill the hollow places, as in the Hands and Feet, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Griſtle is a member ſimple and Sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke, next in hardneſſe to the Bone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is of complexion cold and dry, and inſenſible. The Griſtle was ordained for ſixe cauſes or profits that J find in it: The firſt is, that the continuall moving of the hard Bone might not be done in a juncture, but that the Griſtle ſhould be a meane betweene the Ligament and him. The ſecond is, that in the time of concuſſion or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, the ſoft members or limbes ſhould not be hurt of the hard. The third is, that the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Bones and Joynts that be griſly, might the eaſier be foulded and moved together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hurt. The fourth is, for that it is neceſſary in ſome meane places, to put a Griſtle, as in the throat-bowle for the ſound. The fifth is, for that it is needfull that ſome members be holden up with a Griſtle, as the lids of the Eyes. The ſixt is, that ſome Limbes have a ſuſtaining and a drawing abroad, as in the Noſe and the Eares, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Ligament is a member conſimple, ſimple, and ſpermaticke, next in hardneſſe to the Griſtle, and of complexion cold and dry, and is flexible and inſenſible, and bindeth the Bones together.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:121645:14"/>
The cauſe why hee is flexible and inſenſible, is this: If it had beene ſenſible, he might not have ſuffered the labour and moving of the joynts: and if it had not beene flexible of his bowing, one Limme ſhould not have moved without another. The ſecond profit is that he be joyned with ſinewes, for to make Cordes and Brawnes. The third helpe is, that he be a reſting place to ſome ſinewes. The fourth profit is, that by him the members that be within the Bone be ſuſtained, as the Matrix and Kidneys, and divers other, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Sinew, is a conſimilier member, ſimple and ſpermatick, a meane betweene hard and ſoft, and in complexion cold and dry, and he is both flexible and ſenſible, ſtrong and tough, having his beginning from the Braine, or from <hi>Mynuca,</hi> which is the Marrow of the backe. And from the braine commeth ſeaven paire of Nerves ſenſative, and from <hi>Mynuca</hi> commeth thirty paire of Nerves motive, and one that is by himſelfe, that ſpringeth of the laſt ſpondell. All theſe ſinewes have both feeling and moving, in ſome more, and in ſome leſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A Corde or Tendon, is a conſimple or officiall member compound and ſpermaticke, ſinewie, ſtrong and tough, meanely betweene hardneſſe and ſoftneſſe, and meanly ſenſible and flexible
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:121645:15"/>
and in complexion cold and dry. And the Corde or Tendon is thus made: The ſinewes that come from the braine and from <hi>Mynuca,</hi> and goe to move the members, is intermingled with the Lygaments, and when the ſinewes and Lyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are intermingled together, then is made a Corde. And for three cauſes J perceive why the Cordes were made.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that the Sinew alone is ſo ſenſible, that hee may not ſuffer the great labour and travell of moving, without the fellowſhip and ſtrength of the Ligament that is inſenſible, and that letteth his great feeling, and bringeth him to a perfit temperance. And ſo the Cordes move the limbes to the will of the ſoule. And this Corde is aſſociated with a ſimple fleſh, and ſo thereof is made a Brawne or a Muskle, on whom he might reſt after his travell: and this Brawne is called a Muskle. Then when this Corde is entred into this Brawne, he is departed into many ſmall threeds, the which be called Will: and this Will hath three properties: The firſt, is in length, by whoſe vertue that draweth it hath might. The ſecond in breadth, by whom the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue that caſteth out hath might. The third, in thwartnes, in whom the vertue that holdeth hath might: and at the end of the Brawne thoſe threeds be gathered together to make another Muskle, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:121645:15"/>
Now J will begin at the Arteir. This Arteir is a member conſimile, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imple and ſpermaticke, hollow and ſinowie, having his ſpringing from the Heart, bringing from the heart to every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, blood and ſpirit of life. It is of complexion cold and dry. And all theſe Arteirs have two coates, except one that goeth to the Lungs, and he hath but one coate that ſpreadeth abroad in the Lungs, and bringeth with him to the Lungs, blood with the ſpirit of life to nouriſh the Lungs withall: And alſo that Arteir bringeth with him from the Lungs ayre to temper the fumous heate that is in the heart. And this Arteir is he that is called <hi>Arteria Venalis,</hi> becauſe he hath but one coate as a veyne, and is more obedient to be delated abroad through all the Lungs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the blood might the ſooner ſweat through him: whereas all other Arteirs have two coates, becauſe one coate may not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the might and power of the ſpirit of life. Divers other cauſes there be, which ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Anatomie of the breaſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Veyne is a ſimple member, in complexion cold and dry, and ſpermaticke, like to the Arteir<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having his beginning from the Liver, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the Liver nutritiue blood, to nouriſh every member of the body with. And it is ſo to be underſtood, that there is no more difference
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:121645:16"/>
betweene theſe two veſſels of blood, but that the Arteir is a veſſell of blood ſpirituall or vitall. And the Veyne is a veſſell of blood nutrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, of the which Veynes, there is noted two moſt principall, of the which, one is called <hi>Vena Porta:</hi> the other is called <hi>Vena celis,</hi> of whom it is too much to treat of now, untill we come to the Anatomy of the Wombe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Fleſh, is a conſimile member, ſimple, not ſpermaticke, and is ingendred of blood congealed by heat, and is in complexion hot and moyſt. Of the which is noted three kinds of Fleſhes: that is to ſay, one is ſoft and pure fleſh: the ſecond is <hi>Muſculus,</hi> or hard and brawny fleſh: the third is <hi>Glandulus,</hi> knotty, or kurnelly fleſh. Alſo the commodities of the fleſh, be indifferent, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ome be common to every kinde of fleſh, and ſome be proper to one manner of fleſh alone. The profits of the fleſh be many, for ſome defend the body from cold as doth cloathes: alſo it defendeth the body from hard things comming againſt it: ſo through his moyſture he recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth the Body in Summer, in time of great heate.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it is to be conſidered, what profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe is in every kind of fleſh by himſelfe. And firſt of ſimple and pure fleſh, which fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the concavities of voyd places, and cauſeth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:121645:16"/>
good forme and ſhape: and this fleſh is found betweene the teeth, and on the end of the yard. The profits of the Brawny fleſh or <hi>Muſculus</hi> fleſh, ſhall be ſpoken of in the Anatomy of the Armes. The profits of the Glandulus fleſh are theſe. Firſt, that it turneth the blood into a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour like to himſelfe, as doth the fleſh of a womans pappes turne the menſtruall Blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to milke. Secondly, the Glandulus fleſh of the Teſtikles, turneth the blood into Sparme. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Glandulus fleſh of the cheekes, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth the ſpettle, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The next is of Fatneſſe, of the which J find three kinds. The firſt is <hi>Pinguedo,</hi> and it is a conſimiler member, not ſpermaticke, and it is made of a ſubtill portion of Blood congealed by colde: and it is of complexion cold and moyſt, inſenſible, and is intermingled amongſt the parts of the fleſh. The ſecond, is <hi>Adeppes,</hi> and is of the ſame kind as is <hi>Pinguedo,</hi> but it is departed from the fleſh beſides the Skin and it is as an Oyle hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and moyſtning the Skin. The third is <hi>Auxingia,</hi> and it is of kind as the others be, but he is departed from the fleſh within foorth about the Kidneyes, and in the Intrailes, and it helpeth both the Kidneyes and the Intrailes, from drying by his unctioſity, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then come wee to the Skin. The Skin is a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:121645:17"/>
conſimile member or officiall, partly ſperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, ſtrong and tough, flexible and ſenſible, thin and temperate: whereof there be two kinds: One is the Skin that covereth the outward mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: and the other the inner members, which is called a Pannicle, the profitableneſſe of whom, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>poken in the laſt leſſon: but the Skin is properly woven of Threeds, Nerves. Veynes, and Arteirs. And he is made temperate, becauſe he ſhould be a good redeemer of heate from cold, and of moyſtneſſe from dryneſſe, that there ſhould nothing annoy or hurt the Body, but it giveth warning to the common wits thereof, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The haires of every part of mans Body, are but ſuperfluity of members, made of the groſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Nayles likewiſe, are a ſuperfluity of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> engendred of great earthly ſmoke or fume reſolved through the naturall heate of humors, and is ſofter then the Bone, and harder then the Fleſh. In complexion they be cold and dry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are alwayes waxing in the extremity of the fingers and toes. The utility of them are, that by them a man ſhall take the better hold: alſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:121645:17"/>
they helpe to claw the body when it needeth. Laſtly, they helpe to divide things for lacke of other tooles, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith in the ſecond Chapter <hi>De juva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,</hi> and <hi>Avicen</hi> rehearſeth the ſame in his firſt Propoſition and third Chapter, proving that the Head of man was made neither for wits, nor yet for the Braines, but onely for the Eyes. For beaſts that have no heads, have the organs or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of wits in their breaſts. Therefore God and Nature have reared up the head of man one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the eyes, for it is the higheſt member of man: and as a Beholder or Watchman ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a high Tower to give warning of the Enemies, ſo doth the Eye of man give warning vnto the common Wittes, for the defence of all other members of the body.</p>
               <p>Now to our purpoſe. If the queſtion be asked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how many things be there contained on the Head,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:121645:18"/>
and how many things contained within the head? As it is rehearſed by <hi>Guydo,</hi> there be five containing, and as many contained, as thus: The haire, the skin, the fleſh, the Pannicles, and the Bone; neither rehearſing Veine nor Artier. The which Anatomy cannot be truly without them both, as thou ſhalt well perceive both in this but eſpecially in the next. And now in this Leſſon J ſhall ſpeake but of Haire, Skin, Fleſh, Veynes, Pannicles, and Bones, what profit they doe to man, every of them in his kind. Of the haire of the Head, (whoſe creation is knowne in the Anatomy of the ſimple Members) J doe note foure utilities why it was ordained. The firſt is, that it defendeth the braine from too much heat, and too much cold, and many other outward noyances.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, it maketh the forme or ſhape of the Head to ſeeme more ſeemelyer or beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller. For if the Head were not haired, the Face and the Head ſhould ſeeme but one thing, and therefore the haire formeth and ſhapeth the Head from the Face.</p>
               <p>The third is, that by colour of the haire, is witneſſed and knowne the complexion of the Braine.</p>
               <p>The fourth is, that the fumoſities of the Braine might aſcend and paſſe lightlyer out by them.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:121645:18"/>
For if there were a ſad thing, as the skinne, or other of the ſame nature, as the Haire is, the fumoſities of the Braine might not have paſſed through it ſo lightly, as it doth by the Haire.</p>
               <p>The Skin of the head is more Lazartus, thicker, and more Porrus, then any other Skinne of any other member of the body. And two cauſes J note why; One is, that it keepeth or defendeth the Braine from too much heat and cold as doth the Haire. The other, that it diſcuſſeth to the common wits of all things that noyet h outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for the haire is inſenſible. The third cauſe why the skinne of the head is more thicker then any other skinne of the body, is this; that it keepeth the braine the more warme, and is the better fence for the Braine, and it bindeth and keepeth the Bones of the head the faſter toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Next followeth the Fleſh, the which is all Muſculus or Lazartus fleſh, lying upon Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranium without meane. And it is made of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till Will, and of ſimple fleſh, Sinewes, Veynes and Arteirs. And why the fleſh that is all Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus or Lazartus in every member of a mans body was made, is for three cauſes. The firſt is, that by his thickneſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſhould comfort the digeſtion of other members that lye by him. The ſecond is, that through him every member is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:121645:19"/>
made is the formelier, and taketh the better ſhape. The third is, that by his meanes every member of the Body, drawing to him nouriſhing, the which others with-hold to put forth from them, as it ſhall be more plainlyer ſpoken of in the Anatomy of the Wombe.</p>
               <p>Next followeth Pericranium, or the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bones of the Head. But here it is to be noted of a Veyne and an Arteir that commeth betweene the Fleſh and this Pericranium, that nouriſheth the utter part of the head, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth privily thorow the Commiſſaries of the Skull bearing to the Braine and to his Pannicles nouriſhing: Of whoſe ſubſtance, is made both Duramater, and alſo Pericranium, as ſhall be declared in the parts contayned in the Head. Here it is to be noted of this Pannicle Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cranium, that it bindeth or compaſſeth all the Bones of the Head, vnto whom is adjoyned Duramater, and is alſo a part of his ſubſtance, howbeit they be ſeparated, for Duramater is neerer the Braine, and is vnder the Skull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>This Pericranium was made principally for two cauſes: one is, that for his ſtrong binding together, hee ſhould make firme and ſtable the feeble Commiſſaries or ſeames of the Bones of the Head. The other cauſe is, that it ſhould be a meane betweene the hard bone and the ſoft. fleſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:121645:19"/>
Next, is the Bone of the Pot of the head, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Braines, of which it were too long to declare their names after all Authors, as they number them and their names, for ſome name them after the Greeke tongue, and ſome after the Arabian: but in concluſion all this to our purpoſe. And they be numbred ſeven bones in the pan or Skull of the head. The firſt is called the Coronall bone, in which is the Orbits or holes of the Eyes, and it reacheth from the browes unto the midſt of the head, and there it meeteth with the ſecond bone called Occipiſſiall, a bone of the hinder part of the head called the Noddle of the head, which two bones Coronall and Occipiſſiall, be divided by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries, in the middeſt of the Head. The third and fourth Bones be called <hi>Parietales,</hi> and they be the Bones of the ſideling parts of the head, and they be divided by the Commiſſaries, both from the foreſaid Coronall and Occipiſſiall. The fift and ſixt bones be called, <hi>Pet roſa</hi> or <hi>Medoſa:</hi> and theſe two bones lye over the bones called, <hi>Parietales,</hi> on every ſide of the head one, like Skales, in whom be the holes of the Eares. The ſeventh and laſt of the head is called Paxillarie or Bazillarie, the which Bone is as it were a wedge vnto all the other ſeaven Bones of the head, and doth faſten them together. And thus
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:121645:20"/>
be all numbred. The firſt is, the Coronall Bone: the ſecond, is the Occipiſſiall: the third and the fourth, is Parietales: the fifth and the ſixth is Petroſa, or Mendoſa. And the ſeventh is Paxillarie, or Bazillarie. And this ſufficeth for the ſeven bones containing the Head.</p>

               <p>NExt under the Bones of the Head within forth, the firſt thing that appeareth is <hi>Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mater,</hi> then is <hi>Piamater,</hi> then the ſubſtance of the Braine, and then <hi>Vermi formes</hi> and <hi>Lete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirabile.</hi> But firſt we are to ſpeake of <hi>Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mater,</hi> whereof, and how it is ſprung and made: Firſt, it is to be noted of the Veyne and Arteire that was ſpoken of in the laſt Chapter before, how privily they entered through the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, or ſeames of the Head, and there by their Union together, they doe not onely bring and give the ſpirit of Life and nutriment, but alſo doe weave themſelves ſo together, that they make this Pannicle <hi>Duramater.</hi> It is holden up by certaine threeds of himſelfe, comming through the ſaid Commiſſaries, running into <hi>Pericranium</hi> or Pannicle that covereth the Bones of the Head.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:121645:20"/>
And with the foreſaid Veine and Artier, and theſe threeds, comming from Duramater, is woven and made this Pericranium.</p>
               <p>And why this Pannicle <hi>Duramater</hi> is ſet from the Skull, J note two cauſes. The firſt is, that if the <hi>Duramater</hi> ſhould have touched the Skull, it ſhould lightly have beene hurt with the hardneſſe of the Bone. The ſecond cauſe is, that the matter that commeth of wounds made in the Head piercing the Skull, ſhould by it the better be defended and kept from <hi>Piamater,</hi> and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Braine. And next unto this Pannicle, there is another Pannicle called <hi>Piamater,</hi> or Meek-mother, becauſe it is ſoft and tender unto the Braine. Of whoſe creation, it is to be noted as of <hi>Duramater:</hi> For the originall of their firſt creation is of one kind, both from the Heart and the Liver, and is Mother of the very ſubſtance of the Braine. Why it is called <hi>Piamater,</hi> is for becauſe it is ſoft and tender to the Braine, that it nouriſheth the Braine and feedeth it, as doth a loving Mother, unto her tender Childe or Babe, for it is not ſo tough and hard as is <hi>Duramater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Pannicle <hi>Piamater</hi> is much to be noted of the great number of Veines and Arteirs that are planted, ramefying throughout all his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, giving to the Braine both ſpirit and life. And this Pannicle doth circumvolue or lay all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:121645:21"/>
the ſubſtance of the Braine: and in ſome plaec of the Braine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Veynes and the Artiers goe forth of him, and enter into the diviſions of the Braine, and there drinketh of the Braines ſubſtance into them, asking of the Heart, to them the ſpirit of life or breath, and of the Liver nutriment. And the aforeſaid ſpirit or breath taketh a further diſgeſtion, and there it is made animall by the elaboration of the ſpirit vitall, and is turned and made animall. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, why there be no more Pannicles over the Braine then one, is this: If there had beene but one Pannicle onely, either it muſt have beene hard or ſoft, or meane, betweene both: If it had beene hard, it ſhould have hurt the Braine by his hardneſſe. If it had beene ſoft, it ſhould have beene hurt of the hard Bone. And if it had beene but meanly, neyther hard nor ſoft, it ſhould have hurt the Braine by his roughneſſe, and alſo have beene hurt of the hard Bone. Therefore God and Nature hath ordained two Pannicles, the one hard, and the other ſoft, the harder to be a meane betweene the ſoft and the Bone: and the ſofter to be a meane betweene the harder and the Braine it ſelfe. Alſo theſe Pannicles be cold and dry of complexion, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>permaticke.</p>
               <p>Next is the Braine, of which it is marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:121645:21"/>
to be conſidered and noted, how this Piamater divideth the ſubſtance of the Braine, and lappeth it into certaine ſelles or diviſions, as thus: The ſubſtance of the Braine is divided into three parts or ventricles, of which the foremoſt part is the moſt. The ſecond or middlemoſt is leſſe: the third or hindermoſt is the leaſt. And from each one to another be iſſues or paſſages that are called <hi>Meates,</hi> through whom paſſeth the ſpirit of life to and fro. But here ye ſhall note, that every Ventricle is divided into two parts, and in every part God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and ſet ſingular and ſeverall vertues, as thus; Firſt, in the foremoſt Ventricle, God hath founded and ſet the common wittes, otherwiſe, called the five Wits, as Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling, and Taſting. And alſo there is one part of this Ventricle, the vertue that is called Fantaſie, and he taketh all the formes or ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that be diſpoſed of the five Wittes, after the meaning of ſenſible things. In the other part of the ſame Ventricle, is ordained and founded the Imaginative vertue, the which receiveth of the common Wittes the forme or ſhape of ſenſitive things, as they were received of the common Wittes without-forth, repreſenting their owne ſhape and ordinances unto the memorative vertue. In the middle Sell or Ventricle, there is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:121645:22"/>
founded and ordained the Cogitative or eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive vertue: for he rehearſeth, ſheweth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, and deemeth thoſe things that be offered vnto him, by the other that were ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. In the third Ventricle and laſt, there is founded and ordained the vertue Memorative: in this place is regiſtred and kept thoſe things that are done and ſpoken with the ſences and keepe them in his treaſury vnto the putting forth of the five or common Wittes, or Organes, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of animall workes, out of whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities or lower parts ſpringeth Mynuca, or Marrow of the Spondels: of whom it ſhall be ſpoken of in the Anatomy of the Neck and back.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, it is to be noted, that from the foremoſt Ventricle of the Braine, ſpringeth ſeven paire of ſentative or feeling Sinewes, the which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e produced to the Eyes, the Eares, the Noſe, the Tongue, and to the Stomacke, and to divers other parts of the Body: as it ſhall be declared in their Anatomies. Alſo it is to be noted, that about the middle Ventricle is the place of <hi>Vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formis,</hi> with kurnelly fleſh that filleth, and <hi>Retemirabile,</hi> a wonderfull Cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e vnder the Pannicles, is ſet or bounded with Arteirs onely which come from the Heart, in the which the vitall ſpirit by his great labour, is turned and made animall. And yee ſhll underſtand, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:121645:22"/>
theſe two be the beſt kept parts of all the Body: for a man ſhall rather dye, than any of theſe ſhould ſuffer any manner of griefes from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forth, and therefore God hath ſet them farre from the Heart.</p>
               <p>Heere J note the ſaying of <hi>Haly Abba,</hi> of the comming of ſmall Artiers from the Heart, of whom (ſaith he) is made a marvellous Net or Caule, in the which Caule is incloſed the Braine, and in that place is laid the ſpirit of Feeling, from that place hath the ſpirit of Feeling his firſt creation, and from thence paſſeth other members, &amp;c. Furthermore yee ſhall underſtand, that the Brain is a member cold and moiſt of complexion, thin, and meanly viſcous, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> principal member, and an officiall member and ſpermaticke. And firſt, why he is a principall member, is, becauſe he is the governour or the treaſury of the five Wittes: And why he is an officiall member, is, becauſe he hath the effect of feeling and ſtirring: And why he is cold and moyſt, is, that he ſhould by his coldneſſe and moyſtneſſe, abate and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the exceeding heate and drought that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the Heart. And why it is moyſt, is, that it ſhould be the more indifferenter and abler to every thing that ſhould be reſerved or gotten into him. And why it is ſoft, is, that it ſhould give place and favour to the vertue of ſtirring.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:121645:23"/>
And why it is meanly viſcous, is, that his ſinewes ſhould not be letted in their working, through his overmuch hardneſſe.</p>
               <p>Heere <hi>Galen</hi> demandeth a queſtion, which is this: Whether that Feeling and moving be brought to Nerves by one or by divers? Or whether the aforeſaid thing be brought ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially or rather judicially? The matter (ſaith he) is ſo hard to ſearch and to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that it were much better to let it alone and paſſe over it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> intreating of the Braine, ſaith: The Braine is a member continually moving and ruling all other members of the body, giving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them both Feeling and moving: for if the Braine be let, all other members be let: and if the Braine be well, then all other members of the body be the better diſpoſed.</p>
               <p>Alſo, the Braine hath this property, that it moveth and followeth the moving of the Moone: For in the waxing of the Moone, the Braine followeth upwards, and in the wane of the Moone, the Braine diſcendeth downewards, and vaniſheth in ſubſtance of vertue: for then the Braine ſhrinketh together in it ſelfe, and is not ſo fully obedient to the ſpirit of Feeling. And this is proved in men that be Lunaticke and Mad, and alſo in men that be Epulenticke or having
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:121645:23"/>
the Falling ſickneſſe, that be moſt grieved in the beginning of the new Moone and in the latter quarter of the Moone. Wherefore (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> when it happeneth that the Braine is either too dry or too moyſt, then can it not worke his kind, for then is the Body made cold: then are the ſpirits of Life melted and reſolved away: and then followeth feebleneſſe of the Wittes, and of all other members of the Body, and laſt Death.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V. The Anatomy of the Face.</head>
               <p>THe Front or the Forehead, containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Skin and <hi>Muſculus</hi> fleſh, for the Pannicle underneath, it is of Pericranium, and the Bone is of the Coronall bone. Howbeit there it is made broad as if there were a double bone, which maketh the forme of the browes. It is called the Forehead or Front, from one eare to the other, and from the rootes of the eares of the head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before unto the Browes. But the cauſe why the browes were ſet and reared up, was, that they ſhould defend the eyes from noyance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out-foorth: and they be ordained with haire, to put by the humor or ſweat that commeth from the head. Alſo the browes doe helpe the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:121645:24"/>
eye-liddes, and doe beautifie and make faire the face, for he that hath not his browes haired, is not ſeemely.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, that over-meaſurable Browes betokeneth an envious man. Alſo high browes and thicke, betokeneth cowardiſe: and meanly, ſignifieth gentleneſſe of heart. Inciſions about this part, ought to be done according to the length of the body, for there the Muſcle goeth from one Eare to the other. And there if any inciſion ſhould be made with the length of the Muſcle, it might happen the brow to hang over the eye without remedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is many times ſeene, the more pitty. The Browes are called <hi>Supercilium</hi> in Latine, and under is the eye-lids, which is called <hi>Cilium,</hi> and is garniſhed with haires. Two cauſes J find why the eye-lids were ordained. The firſt is, that they ſhould keepe and defend the Eye from Duſt and other outward noyances. The ſecond is, when the eye is weary or heavie, then they ſhould be covered and take reſt nnderneath them. Why the haires were ordained in them is, that by them is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the formes or ſimilitudes of viſible things vnto the Apple of the Eye. The Eare is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſeemely and griſtly, able to be holden with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and is the Organ or Inſtrument of Hearing: It is of complexion cold and dry. But why the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:121645:24"/>
Eare was ſet up out of the head, is this, that the ſounds that be very fugitive, ſhould lurke and abide under his ſhadow, till it were taken of the Inſtruments of Hearing. Another cauſe is, that it ſhould keepe the hole that it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over, from things falling in that might hinder the Hearing. The Sinewes that are the Organs or Inſtruments of Hearing, ſpring each from the Braine, from whence the ſeven paire of Sinewes doe ſpring, and when they come to the hole of the Eare, there they writhe like a Winepreſſe: and at the ends of them, they be like the head of a Worme, or like a little teate, in which is received the ſound, and ſo carryed to the common wits. The Eyes be next of nature unto the Soule: for in the Eye is ſeene and knowne the diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and griefes, gladneſſe and joyes of the Soule; as Love, Wrath, and other paſſions. The Eyes be the Inſtruments of ſight. And they be compound and made of ten things: that is to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſeven Tunicles or Coates, and of three humours. Of the which (ſayth <hi>Galen)</hi> the Braine and the Head were made for the Eye, that they might be in the higheſt as a Beholder in a Tower, as it was rehearſed in the Anatomy of the Head. But divers men hold divers opinions of the Anatomy of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:121645:25"/>
Eyes: for ſome men account but three Tunicles, and ſome ſixe. But in concluſion, they meane all one thing. For the very truth is, that there be counted and reckoned ſeven Tunicles, that is to ſay, <hi>Selirotica, Secondina, Retyna, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nia, Cornua, Araniae,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctiva:</hi> and theſe three humours. That is, to ſay, Humor, <hi>Virtus,</hi> Humor <hi>Albigynus,</hi> and Humor <hi>Chryſtallinus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is to bee knowne how and after what manner they ſpring: You ſhall underſtand, that there ſpringeth of the Braine ſubſtance of his foremoſt Ventricles, two Sinewes, the one from the right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ide, and the other from the left, and they bee called the firſt paire; for in the Anatomie, they be the firſt paire of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes that appeare of all ſeven. And it is ſhewed by <hi>Galen,</hi> that theſe Sinewes be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low as a Reede<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for two cauſes. The firſt is, that the viſible ſpirit might paſſe freely to the Eyes. The ſecond is, that the forme of viſible things might freely be preſented to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wittes.</p>
               <p>Now marke the going forth of theſe ſinewes. When theſe ſinewes goe out from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Braine, he commeth through the Piamater, of whoſe ſubſtance he taketh a Pannicle or a Coate: and the cauſe why he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:121645:25"/>
taketh that Pannicle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to keepe him from anoying, and before they enter into the Skull, they meete and are united into one ſinew the length of halfe an inch: and then they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part againe into two, and each goeth into one Eye, entring through the Braine-panne, and theſe ſinewes be called <hi>Nervi optici.</hi> And three cauſes J finde why theſe Nerves are joyned in one before they paſſe into the Eye. Firſt, if it happen any diſeaſes in one Eye, the other ſhould receive all the viſible ſpirit that before came to both.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that all things that we ſee ſhould not ſeeme two: for if they had not beene joyned together, every thing ſhould have ſeemed two, as it doth to a Worme, and to other Beaſts.</p>
               <p>The third is, that the ſinew might ſtay and helpe the other. But hereupon <hi>Lanfranke</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth much: ſaying, that theſe two ſinewes came together to the Eyes, and take a Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle both of Piamater and of Duramater, and when they enter into the Orbit of the Eye, there the extremities are ſpread abroad, the which are made of three ſubſtances: that is to ſay, of Duramater, of Piamater, and of <hi>Nervi optici.</hi> There be engendred three Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles or Coates, as thus: Of the ſubſtance
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:121645:26"/>
that is taken from Duramater, is engendred the firſt Coate that is called <hi>Secondina:</hi> and of <hi>Nervi optici,</hi> is engendred the third Coate, that is called <hi>Retina:</hi> and each of them is more ſubtiller then other, and goeth about the humours without meane. And it to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that each of theſe three Tunicles be divided, and ſo they make ſixe: that is to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> three of the parts of the braine, and three of the parts outwards, and one of Pericranium, that covereth the Bones of the head, which is called <hi>Conjunctiva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you may perceive the ſpringing of them, as thus: Of <hi>Duramater</hi> ſpringeth <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotica</hi> and <hi>Cornua.</hi> Of <hi>Piamater,</hi> ſpringeth <hi>Secondina</hi> and <hi>Vnia.</hi> And of <hi>Nervi Optici,</hi> ſpringeth <hi>Conjunctiva.</hi> Now to ſpeake of the Humours which be three, and their places are the middle of the Eyes; of the which, the firſt is Humor <hi>Vltrus,</hi> becauſe he is like glaſſe, in colour very cleere, red, liquid, or thin, and hee is in the inward ſide next unto the Braine; and it is thin, becauſe the nutritive blood of the Chriſtaline might paſſe, as water through a ſpunge ſhould bee clenſed and made pure, and alſo that the viſible ſpirit might the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier paſſe through him from the Braine. And he goeth about the Chriſtaline humour, untill he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:121645:26"/>
meet with <hi>Albuginus</hi> humour, which is ſet in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ttermoſt part of the Eye. And in the middeſt of theſe humours, <hi>Vltrus</hi> and <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus,</hi> is ſet the Chryſtaline humour, in which is ſet principally the ſight of the Eye. And theſe Humours be ſeparated and involved with the Pannicles as aforeſaid, betweene every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour a Pannicle; and thus is the Eye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and made. But to ſpeake of every Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and every Pannicle in his due order and courſe, it would aske a long progreſſe, and a long Chapter; but this is ſufficient for a Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion, at preſent.</p>
               <p>Now to begin at the Noſe; You ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that from the Braine there commeth two Sinewes to the holes of the Braine-pan, where beginneth the concavity of the Noſe, and theſe two be not properly Sinewes, but Organs or Inſtruments of ſmelling, and have heads like teats or paps, in which is received the vertue of Smelling, and repreſenting it to the common wits: Over theſe two, is ſet <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorium</hi> t hat which wee call the Noſthrils; and is ſet betweene the Eyes, under the upper part of the Noſe. And it is to bee noted, that this concavity or ditch was made for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; The firſt is, that the ayre that bringeth forth the ſpirit of Smelling might reſt in it, till
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:121645:27"/>
it were taken of the Organs or Inſtrument of ſmelling. The ſecond cauſe is, that the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of the Braine might be hidden under it, untill it were clenſed: and from this concavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there goeth two holes down into themouth, of which there is to be noted three benefits.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that when a mans mouth is cloſe, or when he eateth or ſleepeth, that then the ayre might come through them to the Lungs, or elſe a mans mouth ſhould alwayes bee open. The ſecond cauſe is, that they helpe to the relation of the forme of the Noſe; for it is ſaid, a man ſpeaketh in his Noſe, when any of theſe holes be ſtopped. The third cauſe is, that the concavity might bee clenſed by them, when a man ſnuffeth the Noſe, or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into his mouth inwardly. The Noſe is a member conſimple or official, appearing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the face, ſomewhat plyable, becauſe it ſhould the better be clenſed. And it is to bee perceived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it is compound and made of Skin and Lazartus fleſh, and of two Bones ſtanding in manner tryangle-wiſe, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities bee joyned in one part of the Noſe with the Coronall bone, and the nether extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are joyned with two Griſtles, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that divideth the Noſthrils within, and holdeth up the Noſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:121645:27"/>
Alſo there be two concavities or holes, that if one were ſtopped the other ſhould ſerve; Alſo there is in the Noſe two Muſcles to help the working of his office.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Gal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n</hi> ſaith, that the Noſe ſhapeth the Face moſt; for where the Noſe lacketh (ſaith he) all the reſt of the face is the more unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Noſe ſhould be of a meane bigneſſe, and not to exceed in length or bredth, nor in highneſſe. For <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, If the Noſtrils be too thin or too wide, by great drawing in of ayre, it betokeneth great ſtraitneſſe of heart, and indignation of thought. And therefore it is to be noted, that the ſhape of the Members of the body, betokeneth and judgeth the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and will of the Soule of man, as the Philoſopher ſaith, the Temples are called the members of the Head, and they have that name becauſe of continuall moving. And as the Science of the <hi>Anatomie</hi> meaneth, the ſpirit vitall is ſent from the heart to the braine by Arteirs, and by Veynes and nutrimentall blood, where the veſſels Pulſatives in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be lightly hurt. Alſo, the Temples have dents or holes inwardly, wherein he taketh the humour that commeth from the Braine, and bringeth the Eyes a ſleepe; and if the ſaid holes or dents bee preſſed and wrung, then by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:121645:28"/>
trapping of the humour that continueth, hee maketh the teares to fall from the Eye.</p>
               <p>The Cheekes are the ſideling parts of the Face, and they containe in them Muſculus fleſh, with Veynes and Arteirs, and about theſe parts be many Muſcles. <hi>Guido</hi> maketh mention of ſeaven about the Cheekes and over-lip.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Haly-Abbas</hi> ſaith, there be twelue Muſcles that move the neither Jaw, ſome of them in opening, and other ſome in cloſing or ſhutting, paſſing under the Bones of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: and they be called <hi>Temporales:</hi> And they be the right noble and ſenſatiue, of whoſe hurt is much perill.</p>
               <p>Alſo, there bee other Muſcles for to grinde and to chew. And to all theſe Muſcles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Nerves from the Braine, to give them feeling and moving. And alſo there commeth to them, many Arteirs and Veynes, and chiefly about the Temples, and the angles or corners of the Eyes and the Lips. And as the Philoſophers ſay, the chiefe beauty in man is in the Cheekes, and there the complexion of man is moſt knowne, as thus: If they be full, ruddy, and medled with temperate whiteneſſe, and not fat in ſubſtance, but meanely fleſhie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it betokeneth hot and moyſt
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:121645:28"/>
of complexion: that is, Sanguine and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in colour. And if they be white co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, without medling of redneſſe, and in ſubſtance fat and ſoft, quavering<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it betoken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, exceſſe and ſuperfluity of cold and moyſt: that is Flegmaticke. And if they be browne in colour or cytron, yellow, redde and thinne, and leane in ſubſtance, it betokeneth great drying and heate: that is cholericke. And if they be as it were blowne in colour, and of little fleſh in ſubſtance, it betokeneth exceſſe and ſuperfluity of dryneſſe and cold : that is Melancholy. And as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith, the Cheekes doe not onely ſhew the diverſities of complexions, but alſo the affection and will of the Heart: for by the affection of the heart, by ſuddaine joy or dread, he waxeth either pale or red.</p>
               <p>The bones or bony parts, firſt of the Cheekes be two: of the Noſe outwardly two: of the upper Mandible, two: within the Noſe three, as thus: One deviding the Noſthrils within, and in each Noſthrill one, and they ſeeme to be rowled like a wafer, and have a hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them, by which th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:121645:29"/>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that there be in the face nine bones, yet J cannot find that the nether Mandible ſhould be of the number of thoſe nine: for the nether Mandible accounted there, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them to be Ten in number: Of which thing J will hold no argument, but remit it to the ſight of your Eyes. The parts of the mouth are five, that is to ſay, the Lippes, the Teeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Tongue, the Uvila, and the Pallet of the mouth. And firſt to ſpeake of the Lips, they are members conſimile or officiall, full of Muſculus fleſh, as is aforeſaid, and they were ordained for two cauſes, one is; that they ſhould be to the mouth as a doore to a houſe, and to keepe the mouth cloſe till the meat were kindly chewed. The other cauſe is, that they ſhould be helpers to the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the ſpeech. The Teeth are members conſimile or officiall, ſpermaticke, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of any other members, and are faſtned in the Cheeke bones, and were ordained for three cauſes. Firſt, that they ſhould chew a mans meate, ere it ſhould paſſe downe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it might be the ſooner digeſted.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, that they ſhould be a helpe to the ſpeech: for they that lacke their teeth, doe not perfectly pronounce their words.</p>
               <p>The third is, that they ſhould ſerve to beaſts
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:121645:29"/>
as weapons. The number of them is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: for ſome men haue more, and ſome leſſe: they that have the whole number, have two and thirty: that is to ſay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Ligaments, Veynes and Artiers, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained principally for three cauſes.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that when a man eateth, the Tongue might helpe to turne the meat till it were well chewed. The ſecond cauſe is, that by him is received the taſt of ſweete and ſowre, and preſented by him to the common Wittes. The third is, that by him is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced every ſpeech. The fleſhie part of the Tongue is white, and hath in him nine Muſcles, and about the roote of him, is Glandulus, in the which be two welles, and they be ever full of ſpettle to temper and keepe moyſt the Tongue, or elſe it would waxe dry by reaſon of his labour, &amp;c. The Uvila is a member made of ſpongeous fleſh, hanging downe from the end of the Pallet over the gullet of the throat, and is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in complexion cold and dry, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when there falleth rawneſſe or much
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:121645:30"/>
moyſtneſſe into it from the Head, then it hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth downe in the throate, and letteth a man to ſwallow, and it is broad at the upper end, and ſmall at the nether. It was ordained for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers cauſes. One is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by him is holpen the ſound of ſpeech: for where the Uvila is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there lacketh the perfect ſound of ſpeech. Another is, that it might helpe the prolation of vomits. Another is, that by him is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and abated the diſtemperance of the ayre that paſſeth to the Lungs. Another is, that by him is guided the ſuperfluities of the Braine, that commeth from the coletures of the Noſe, or the ſuperfluities would fall downe ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the mouth, the which were a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

The Skinne of the Pallet of the mouth is, of the inner part of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Myre, and of Iſofagus, that is the way of the meate into the Stomacke. The way how to know that ſuch a Pannicle is of that part of the ſtomack, may be knowne when that a man is touched within the mouth, anon he beginneth to tickle in the ſtomacke, and the neerer that he ſhall couch unto the throat, the more it abhorreth the ſtomacke, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it caufeth the ſtomacke to yeeld from him that is within him, as when a man doth vomit.</p>
               <p>Alſo, in the mouth is ended the uppermoſt extremity of the Weſand, which is called Myre, or Iſofagus: And with him is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned <hi>Trachia arteria:</hi> that is, the way of the ayre, whoſe holes be covered with a lap like a tongue, and is griftly, that the meat and drinke might ſlide ov er him into Iſofagus: the which griſtle when a man ſpeaketh is reared up, and covereth the way of the meate, and when a man ſwalloweth the meate, then it covereth the way of the ayre, ſo that when the one is covered, the other is uncovered. For if a man open the way of the ayre, when he ſwalloweth, if there fall a crum into it, hee ſhall never ceaſe coughing untill it be up againe. And this ſufficeth for the Face.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. The Anatomie of the Necke.</head>
               <p>THE Necke followeth next to be ſpoken of. <hi>Galen</hi> proveth, that the Necke was made for no other cauſe but for the Lungs, for all things that have no Lungs, have ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Necke nor voyce, except Fiſh. And you ſhall underſtand, that the necke is all that is contayned betweene the head and the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and betweene the chin and the breaſt. It is compound and made of foure things, that is to ſay, of <hi>Spondillis,</hi> of <hi>Servicibus,</hi> of <hi>Gula,</hi> and of <hi>Gutture,</hi> the which ſhall be declared more plainly hereafter: and through theſe paſſe the way of the meate and of the ayre, but they be not the ſubſtance of the Necke.</p>
               <p>The Spondels of the Necke be ſeaven: The firſt is joyned unto the lower part of the head called Paxillary, or Bazillary, and in the ſame wiſe are joyned every Spondell with other, and the laſt of the ſeaven, with the firſt of the Backe or Ridge: and the Lygaments that keepe theſe Spondels together, are not ſo hard and tough as thoſe of the backe: for why? thoſe of the necke bee more feebler and ſubtiller. The cauſe is this, for it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:121645:31"/>
other while that the Head move wtthout the necke, and the Necke without the Head, the which might not well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have beene done if they had beene ſtrong and boyſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Of theſe aforeſaid ſeaven Spondels of the Necke, there ſpringeth ſeaven paire of Sinewes, the which be divided into the head and into the viſage, to the Shoulders and to the Armes. From the hole of the firſt Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell ſpringeth the firſt paire of Sinewes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firſt Spondell and the ſecond, and ſo forth of all the reſt in like manner as of theſe. Alſo theſe Sinewes receive ſubtill will of the ſinewes of the braine: of which the Will, and Sinewes, and Fleſh, with a Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle, make the compoſition of Muſcles La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zartes, and Brawnes, the which three things are all one, and be the Inſtruments of voluntary moving every member. The Muſcles of the Necke after <hi>Galen,</hi> are numbred to be twenty, moving the Head and the Necke. Likewiſe it is to be noted, that there bee three manner of fleſhes in the Necke: the firſt is <hi>Pixwex,</hi> or <hi>Serviſis,</hi> and it is called of Children, Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haire, or yeallow haire, the which are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Longitudinals, lying on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:121645:32"/>
cauſe, that when the Sinewes be weary of overmuch labour with moving and travell, that they might reſt upon them as upon a Bed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Fleſh is Muſculus, from whom ſpringeth the Tendons and Cords that move the Head and the Necke, which be numbred twenty, as is before declared. The third Fleſh repleniſheth the void places, &amp;c. The third part of the Necke, is called <hi>Gutture,</hi> and it is ſtanding out of the throat boll. The fourth part is called <hi>Gula,</hi> and the hinder part <hi>Cervix</hi> and hath that name of the Philoſophers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Marrow comming to the Ridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones. It is ſo called, becauſe it is as it were a ſervant to the Braine: For the Necke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth and taketh of the braine, influence of vertue of moving, and ſendeth it by ſinewes to the other parts of the body downewards, and to all members of the body.</p>
               <p>Here you ſhall underſtand, that the way of the Meat, Mire, or <hi>Iſofagus,</hi> is all one thing: and it is to be noted, that it ſtretcheth from the Mouth to the Stomacke, by the hinder part of the necke inwardly faſtned to the Spondels of the Neck, untill he come to the firſt Spondell, and there hee leaveth the Spondell and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth till he come to the foremoſt part of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:121645:32"/>
Breaſt, and paſſeth through <hi>Diafragma,</hi> till hee come to the mouth of the ſtomacke, and there he is ended. Furthermore, it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that this Weaſand is compound, and made of two Tunicles or Coates (that is to ſay) of the inner and of the outer. The outer Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle is but ſimple, for he needeth no Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but onely for his owne nouriſhing: but the inner Tunicle is compound, and made of Muſculus Longitudinall Will, by which he may draw the meate from the mouth into the ſtomack, as it ſhall be more plainly declared in the Anatomy of the ſtomacke. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>Cana Pulmonis, via, trachia, Arteria,</hi> all theſe be one thing (that is to ſay) the Throat-boll, and it is ſet within the Neck, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Weſand, towards <hi>Gula,</hi> and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of the Griſtle, knit each with other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the Pannicle that is meane betweene the Weſand, and the Throat-boll, is called <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <head>CHAP. VII. The Anatomie of the Shoulders and Armes.</head>
               <p>ANd firſt to ſpeake of the Bones: It is to bee noted, that in the Shoulder there be two Bones, (that is to ſay) the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bone, and the Kannell-bone, and alſo the <hi>Adjutor</hi> bone of the Arme, are joyned with the Shoulder-bones, but they are numbred amongſt them, but they are not numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Bones of the Armes. In the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Shoulder, the firſt Bone is; <hi>Os Spatula,</hi> or Shoulder-blade, whoſe hinder part is declined towards the Chine, and in that end it is broad and thin, and in the upper part it is round, in whoſe roundneſſe is a Concavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which is called the Box or coope of the ſhoulder, and which entreth the <hi>Adjutor</hi> bones, and they have a binding together with ſtrong flexible Sinewes, and are contained faſt with each Bone called <hi>Clavicula,</hi> or the Cannel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone. And this Cannell bone ſtretcheth to both the ſhoulders; one end to the one ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and another to the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there they make the compoſition of the ſhoulders. The bones of the great Arme (that is to ſay) from the ſhoulders to the fingers ends, bee Thirty;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:121645:33"/>
the firſt is, the <hi>Adjutor</hi> bone, whoſe upper end entreth into the concavitie or Box of the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bone: It is but one Bone (having no fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low) and it is hollow and full of Marrow, and it is alſo crooked, becauſe it ſhould be the more able to gripe things; and it is hollow, becauſe it ſhould be lighter and more obedient to the ſtirring or moving of the Brawnes.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this Bone hath two eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or two knobs in his nether extremity, or in the juncture of the Elbow (of the which, the one is more riſing then the other) and are made like unto a Pulley to draw water with, and the ends of theſe Bones enter into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavitie proportioned in the uppermoſt ends of thetwo Focklebones, of which two bones, the leſſe goeth from the Elbow to the Thumbe, by the uppermoſt part of the arme, and the greater is the nether bone from the Elbow to the little Finger. And theſe two bones be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with the <hi>Adjutor</hi> bone, and be bound with ſtrong Ligaments, and in like manner with the bones of the Hand. The which bones be numbred Eight, the foure uppermoſt bee joyned with the foure nethermoſt towards the Hands: and in the third ward of Bones be five, and they are called <hi>Oſſa Patinis,</hi> and they are in the Palme of the hand. And to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:121645:34"/>
them be joyned the bones of the Fingers and the Thumbes, as thus; in every finger three bones, and in the Thumbe two bones, (that is to ſay) the Fingers and Thumb of every hand fourteen, called <hi>Oſſa digitorum:</hi> In the Palme of the hand five, called <hi>Patinis;</hi> and between the Hand and the Wriſt eight, called <hi>Raſete:</hi> and from the Wriſt to the Shoulder, three bones: all which being accounted together, yee ſhall find Thirty bones in each Hand and Arme. To ſpeake of Sinewes, Ligaments, Cords, and Brawnes: here firſt ye ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that there commeth from <hi>Mynuea,</hi> through the Spondels of the Necke, foure ſinewes, which moſt plainly doe appeare in ſight, as thus: one commeth into the upper part of the Arme, another into the nether part, and one into the inner ſide, and another into the outer ſide of the Arme, and they bring from the Braine, and from <hi>Mynuca,</hi> both feeling and moving into the Armes, as thus: The ſinewes that come from the Braine and from the Marrow of the Backe that is called <hi>Mynuca,</hi> when they come to the juncture of the ſhoulder, there they are mixed with the Ligaments of the ſame ſhoulder, and there the Ligaments receive both Feeling and mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and alſo in their mingling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:121645:34"/>
they are made a Cord or a Tendon.</p>
               <p>Three cauſes J find why the finewes were mingled with the Lygaments. The firſt cauſe is, that the littleneſſe of the Sinewes, which many wayes bee made weary by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall moving, ſhould bee repreſſed by the inſenſibleneſſe of the Ligaments: The ſecond is, that the littleneſſe of the Sinewes ſhould bee through the quality of the Ligaments: The third is, the feebleneſſe of the Sinew, that is in ſufficient, and too feeble to uſe his Office, but by the ſtrength and hardneſſe of the Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Now to declare what a Cord is, what a Ligament, and what a Muſcle, or a Brawne, it is enough rehearſed in the Chapter of the ſimple Members: but if you will through the commandement of the Will or the Soule, draw the Arme to the hinder parts of the body, then the outer Brawne is drawne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the inner inlarged, and likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when the one Brawne doth draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the other doth ſtretch: and when the Arme is ſtretched in length, then the Cords be lengthened: but when they paſſe the juncture of the Shoulder and of the Elbow, by three fingers breadth or thereabout<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it is divided by ſubtill Will, and mingled with the ſimple
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:121645:35"/>
fleſh, and that which is made of it is called a Brawne. And three cauſes J finde, why that the ſimple fleſh is mingled with the Chord in the compoſition of the Brawne.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that the aforeſaid Will might draw in quiet through the temperance of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that they temper and abate the drought of the Chord with his moyſtneſſe, the which drought he getteth thorow his manifold moving. The third is, that the forme of the Brawne members ſhould be the more faire, and of better ſhape: wherefore God and Nature hath cloathed it with a Pannicle, that it might the better bee kept: And it is called of the Philoſophers, Muſculus, becauſe it hath a forme like unto a Mouſe. And when theſe Brawnes come neere a Joynt, then the Chordes ſpring forth of them, and are mingled with the Ligaments againe, and ſo moveth that Joynt. And ſo yee ſhall underſtand, that alwayes betweene every two Joynts, is engendred a Brawne, proportion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:121645:35"/>
Arme and Hand, as thus; foure in the <hi>Adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> moving the upper part of the Arme; and foure in the Fockles moving the fingers.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeake ſomewhat of the Veynes and Artiers of the arme: It is to be underſtood that from <hi>Venakelis</hi> there commeth two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the one commeth to the one Arme-pit, and the other commeth to the other. And now marke their ſpreading, for as it is of the one, ſo it is of the other, as thus; when the branch is in the Arme-pit, there it is divided into two branches: The one branch goeth along in the inner-ſide of the arme, untill it come to the bough of the arme, and there it is called <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zilica,</hi> or <hi>Epatica,</hi> and ſo goeth downe the arme till it come to the Wriſt, and there it is turned to the back of the Hand, and it is found betweene the little finger and the next, and there it is called <hi>Salvatella.</hi> Now to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther branch that is in the Arme-hole, which ſpreadeth to the outer ſide of the ſhoulder, and there he divideth into two, the one goeth ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up into the carnous part of the Head, and after deſcendeth through the bone into the Braine, as it is declared in the Anatomie of the Head. The other branch goeth on the outward ſide of the Arme, and there hee is divided into two alſo, the one part is ended at the hand,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:121645:36"/>
and the other part is folded about the arme, till it appeare in the bought of the arme, and there is called <hi>Sephalica,</hi> from thence it goeth to the backe of the hand, and appeareth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Tumbe and the foremoſt finger, and there it is called <hi>Sephalica Ocularis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two Branches that J ſpeake of, which be divided in the hinder part of the ſhoulders, from each of theſe two (J ſay ſpringeth one) and thoſe two meete together and make one Veyne which appeareth in the bough of the Arme, and there it is called <hi>Mediana,</hi> or <hi>Cordialis,</hi> or <hi>Commine.</hi> And thus it is to be underſtood, that of <hi>Vena Sephalica,</hi> ſpringeth <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ena Ocularis,</hi> and of <hi>Vena Bazilica,</hi> ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Vena Mediana,</hi> and in ramefying from theſe five principall Veynes ſpringeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, of the which a Chyrurgion hath no great charge: for it ſufficeth us to know the principals.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake of Arteirs, you ſhall underſtand, that whereſoever there is found a Veyne, there is an Arteir under him: and if there be found a great Veyne, there is found a great Artier, and whereas is a little Veyne, there is a little Artier: for whereſoever there goeth a Veyne to give nutriment, there goeth an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier to bring the ſpirit of life. Wherefore it is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:121645:36"/>
to bee noted, that the Artiers lye more deeper in the fleſh then the Veynes doe: for they carry and keepe in them more precious blood then doth the Veyne, and therefore hee hath need to bee further from dangers outwardly: and therefore, God and Nature have ordained for him to be cloſed in two Coates, where the Veyne hath but one.</p>
               <p>The Breaſt or Thorax, is the Arke or Cheſt of the ſpirituall members of man, as ſaith the Philoſopher: where it is to bee noted, that there be foure things containing, and eight contained, as thus. The foure containing, are, the Skinne, Muſculus fleſh, the Pappes and the Bones. The parts contained, are, the Heart, the Lungs, Pannicles, Ligaments, Nerves Veynes, Artiers, Myre, or Iſofagus. Now the Skin and the fleſh are knowne in their Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. It is to be noted, that the fleſh of the Pappes differeth from the other fleſh of the body; for it is white, glandulus, and ſponge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and there is in them both Nerves, Veynes and Artiers, and by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they have <hi>Coli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes</hi> with the Heart, the Liver, the Braine, and the Generative members. Alſo, there is in the Breaſt (as old Authors make mention) Lxxx, or XC. Muſcles; for ſome of them be common to the Neck, ſome to the Shoulders,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:121645:37"/>
and to the Spades; ſome to Diafragma or the Midriffe; ſome to the Ribs, ſome to the Back, and ſome to the Breaſt it ſelfe. But J find a certaine profitableneſſe in the creation of the Pappes, aſwell in man as in woman; for in Man it defendeth the ſpirituals from annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance outwardly, and another by their thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they comfort the naturall heate in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſpirits. And in Women, there is the generation of Milke; for in women there commeth from the Matrix into their breaſts many Veynes which bring into them menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all blood, the which is turned through the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtive vertue, from red colour into white, like the colour of the Paps even as Chilley com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the ſtomack to the Liver is turned into the colour of the Liver.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeake of the Bones of the breſt: they be ſaid to be triple or three-fold, and they be numbred to the ſeaven in the Breſt before, and their length is according to the bredth of the Breſt, and their extremities or ends be griſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Ribbes be. And in the upper end of <hi>Thorax</hi> is a hole or a concavity in which is ſet the foot of the Fockle-bone or Cannel-bone, and in the nether end of Thorax, againſt the mouth of the ſtomack, hangeth a Griſtle called <hi>Enſiforme,</hi> and this Griſtle was ordained for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:121645:37"/>
two cauſes. One is, that it ſhould defend the Stomack from hurt outwardly. The ſecond is, that in time of fulneſſe it ſhould give place to the ſtomack in time of need when it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeake of the parts of the Backe here following; there bee twelve Spondels through whom paſſeth <hi>Mynuca,</hi> of whom ſpringeth twelve paire of Nerves, that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both feeling and moving to the Muſcles of the Breſt aforeſaid. And here it is to be noted, that in every ſide there bee twelve Ribs, that is to ſay, ſeaven true and five falfe, becauſe theſe five be not ſo long as the other ſeaven be: and therefore called falſe Ribs, as it may be perceived by the ſight of the Eye. Likewiſe, of the parts that bee inwardly, and firſt of the Heart, becauſe hee is the principall of all other members and the beginning of Life: hee is ſet in the middeſt of the Breſt ſeverally by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as Lord and King of all members. And as a Lord or a King ought to bee ſerved of his ſubjects that have their living of him; ſo are all other members of the Body ſubjects to the Heart: for they receive their living of him, and they all doe ſervice many wayes unto him againe. The ſubſtance of the Heart is as it were Lazartus fleſh, but it is ſpermatick,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:121645:38"/>
and an officiall member, and the beginning of life, and hee giveth to every member of the Body, both blood of life, and ſpirit of breath, and heate: for if the Heart were of Lazartus fleſh, his moving and ſtirring ſhould be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and not naturall, but the contrary is true: for it were impoſſible that the Heart ſhould be ruled by Will onely, and not by Nature. The Heart hath the ſhape and forme of a Pine-apple, and the broad end thereof is upwards, and the ſharpe end is downewards: depending a little towards the left ſide.</p>
               <p>And heere it is to be noted, that the Heart hath blood in his ſubſtance, whereas all other members have it but in their Veynes and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries: Alſo the Heart is bound with certaine Ligaments to the backe part of the Breaſt, but theſe Lygaments touch not the ſubſtance of the Heart, but in the over-part they ſpring forth of him, and is faſtened as is aforeſaid. Furthermore, the Heart hath two Ventricles, or Concavities, and the left is higher then the right, and the cauſe of his hollowneſſe, is this: For to keepe the blood for his nouriſhing, and the ayre to abate and temper the great heate that hee is in, the which is kept in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities. Now heere it is to be noted, that to the right Ventrickle of the Heart, commeth a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:121645:38"/>
Veyne from the great Veyne called <hi>Venakelis,</hi> that receiveth all the ſubſtance of the blood from the Liver. And this Veyne that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from <hi>Venakelis,</hi> entreth into the heart of the right Ventricle, as J ſaid before, and in him is brought a great portion of the thickeſt blood to nouriſh the heart with, and the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due that is left of this, is made ſubtill through the vertue of the Heart, and then this Blood is ſent into a Concavity or pit in the midſt of the Heart, betweene the two Ventricles, and therein it is made hot and purified, and then it paſſeth into the left Ventricle, and there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in it, a Spirit, that is cleerer, brighter, and ſubtiller, then any Corporall or Bodily thing, that is engendred of the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For it is a thing, that is a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Body and the Soule. Wherefore it is likened of the Philoſophers to be more liker heavenly things, then earthly things.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is to be noted, that from the left Ventricle of the heart ſpringeth two Arteirs: the one having but one Coate, and therefore is called <hi>Arteria Venalis:</hi> And this Arteir carryeth Blood from the Heart to the Lungs, the which Blood is vaporous, that is tryed and and left of the Heart, and is brought by this Artery to the Lungs, to give him Nutriment,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:121645:39"/>
and there he receiveth of the Lungs ayre, and bringeth it to the heart to refreſh him with.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that hee findeth that mans Heart is naturall and friendly to the Lungs: For hee giveth him of his owne Nutrimentall to nouriſh him with, and the Lungs rewards him with ayre to refreſh him with againe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The other Artier that hath two Coats, is called <hi>Vena Arterialis,</hi> or the great Artery, that aſcendeth and deſcendeth, and of him ſpringeth all the other Artiers that ſpread to every member of the Body; for by him is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited and quickned all the members of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. For the Spirit that is retained in them, is the inſtrument or treaſure of all the vertue of the Soule. And thus it paſſeth untill it come to the Braine, and there hee is turned into a further digeſtion, and there he taketh another Spirit and ſo is made animall; and at the Liver nutrimentall, and at the Teſticles generative: and thus it is made a ſpirit of every kind, ſo that hee being the meane of all manner of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and workings, taketh effect. Two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes J find, why theſe Artiers have two coates. One is, that one coat is not ſufficient nor able to withſtand the violent moving and ſtirring of the ſpirit of Life, that is carried in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:121645:39"/>
The ſecond cauſe is, that the thing that is carried about from place to place, is of ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Treaſure that it had the more need of good keeping. And of ſome Doctors, this Artier is called the <hi>Pulſative veyne,</hi> or the beating Veyne; for by him is perceived the pow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r and might of the Heart, &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and Nature have ordained, that the Artiers have two coates. Alſo, there is in the Heart three Pellikles, opening and cloſing the going in of the Heart blood and ſpirit in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time. Alſo, the Heart hath two little Eares, by whom commeth in and paſſeth out the ayre that is prepared for the Lungs. There is alſo found in the heart a Cartilaginous au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditament to helpe and ſtrengthen the ſame Heart. The Heart is covered with a ſtrong Pannicle, which is called of ſome <hi>Capſula Cordes,</hi> or <hi>Pericordium,</hi> the which is a ſtrong caſe, unto whom commeth Nerves as to other inward members. And this Pannicle <hi>Pericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> ſpringeth of the upper Pannicle of the Midriffe. And of him ſpringeth another Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle called <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> the which ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Breſt in the midſt, and keepeth it that the Lungs fall not over the Heart. There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo another Pannicle that covereth the Ribbes inwardly, that is called <hi>Plura,</hi> of whom the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:121645:40"/>
Midriffe taketh his beginning. And it is ſaid of many Doctors, that <hi>Duramater</hi> is the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of all the Pannicles within the body, and thus one taketh of another.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. The Anatomie of the Lungs.</head>
               <p>THe Lungs is a member Spermatick of the firſt creation, and his naturall Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is cold and dry, and in his accidentall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion hee is cold and moyſt, wrapped in a nervous Pannicle, becauſe it ſhould gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the ſofter ſubſtance of the Lungs, and that the Lungs might feele by the meanes of the Pannicle, that which hee might not feele in himſelfe. Now to prove the Lungs to bee cold and dry of kind, it appeareth by his ſwift ſtirring, for hee lyeth ever waving over the Heart, and about the heart. And that hee is cold and moyſt in operation, it appeareth in that hee receiveth of the Braine many cold matters, as Catarres and Rheumes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is thin. Alſo, J find in the Lungs three kinds of ſubſtance. One is a Veyne comming from the Liver, bringing with him the crude or raw part of the Chylle to feed the Lungs. Another is, <hi>Arteria venealis</hi> comming from
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:121645:40"/>
the Heart, bringing with him the ſpirit of Life to nouriſh him with. The third is, <hi>Trachia Arteria,</hi> that bringeth in ayre to the Lungs, and it paſſeth through all the left part of them to doe his office.</p>
               <p>The Lungs is divided into five Lobbes or Pellikles, or five portions, (that is to ſay) three in the right ſide, and two in the left ſide. And this was done for this cauſe, that if there fell any hurt in the one part, the others ſhould ſerve and doe their office. And three cauſes J find, why the Lungs were principally ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Firſt, that they ſhould draw cold wind and refreſh the heart. The ſecond, that they ſhould change and alter, and purifie the ayre before it come to the Heart, leſt the heart ſhould be hurt and annoyed with the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ayre. The third cauſe is, that they ſhould receive from the Heart the fumous ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities that hee putteth forth with his brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Behind the Lungs towards the Spondels, paſſeth Myre or Iſofagus, of whom it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the Anatomic of the Neck. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there paſſeth both Veynes and Artiers, and all theſe with <hi>Trachia Arteria,</hi> doe make a Stoke, replete unto the Gullet with the Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, and ſtrong Ligaments, and Glandulus

fleſh to fulfill the voyd places. And laſt of all, is the Midriffe, and it is an officiall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber made of two Pannicles and Lazartus fleſh, and his place is in the midſt of the body over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart, or in bredth under the region of the Spirituall members, ſeparating them from the <hi>Matrix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And three cauſes J find, why the Midriffe was ordained. Firſt, that it ſhould divide the Spirituals from the Nutrates. The ſecond, that it ſhould keepe the vitall colour or heat to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend downe to the Nutrates. The laſt is, that the malicious fumes reared up from the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, ſhould not annoy the Spirituals or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Wombe is the region or the City of all the Intrailes, the which reacheth from the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe downe unto the Share inwardly, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly from the Reines or Kidnies, downe to the bone <hi>Peeten</hi> about the privie parts. And this Wombe is compound and made of two things (that is to ſay) of <hi>Syfac,</hi> and <hi>Myrac; Syfac</hi> is a Pannicle and a member ſpermatick, officiall, ſenſible, Sinewie, compound of ſubtill Will, and in complexion cold and dry, having his beginning in the inner Pannicle of the Midriffe. And it was ordained, becauſe it ſhould containe and bind together all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:121645:41"/>
and that he defend the Muſculus, ſo that he oppreſſe not the Naturall members. And that he is ſtrong and tough, it is becauſe he ſhould not be lightly broken, and not thoſe things that are contained goe not forth, as it happeneth to them that are broken, &amp;c. <hi>Myrac</hi> is compound, and made of foure things (that is to ſay) of Skinne outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of Fatneſſe, of a Carnous Pannicle, and of Muſculus Fleſh. And that it is to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that all the whole from <hi>Syfac</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is called <hi>Myrac,</hi> it appeareth well (by the words of <hi>Galen)</hi> where hee commandeth, that in all wounds of the Wombe, to ſewe the <hi>Syfac,</hi> with the <hi>Mirac,</hi> and by that it proveth, that there is nothing without the <hi>Syfac</hi> but <hi>Mirac.</hi> And in this <hi>Mirac,</hi> or outer part of the Wombe, there is noted eight Muſcles; two Longitudinals, proceeding from the ſhield of the ſtomacke, unto <hi>Os Pecten:</hi> two Latitudinals comming from the back-wards to the Wombe: and foure Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, of the which, two of them ſpring from the Ribbes on the right ſide, and goe to the left ſide, to the Bones of the Hanches, or of Pecten: and the other two ſpring from the Ribs on the left, and come over the wombe to the right parts, as the other before doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:121645:42"/>
Heere is to be noted, that by the vertue of the ſubtill will that is in the Muſculus Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudinall, is made perfect the vertue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue: and by the Muſculus Tranſverſe, is made the vertue retentive: and by the Muſculus Latitudinall, is made the vertue expulſive. It is thus to be underſtood, that by the vertue attractive, is drawne downe into the Intrailes, all ſuperfluities, both water, winde, and dyet. By the vertue retentive, all things are with-holden and kept, untill Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have wrought his kind. And by the vertue expulſive is put forth all things, when Nature provoketh any thing to be done. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that Wounds or Inciſions be more perilous in the midſt of the wombe, then about the ſides; for there the parts be more tractable then any other parts bee. Alſo he ſaith, that in wounds piercing the wombe, there ſhall not bee made good incarnation, except <hi>Sifac</hi> be ſewed with <hi>Mirac.</hi> Now to come to the parts contained within: Firſt, that which appeareth next under the <hi>Sifac</hi> is <hi>Omentum,</hi> or <hi>Zirbus,</hi> the which is a Pannicle covering the ſtomacke and the Intrailes, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted with many Veynes and Arteirs, and not a little fatneſſe ordained to keepe moyſt the inward parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:121645:42"/>
This <hi>Zirbus</hi> is an oſficiall member, and is compound of a Veyne and an Arteir, the which entreth and maketh a line of the outer Tunicle of the ſtomacke, unto which Tunicle hangeth the <hi>Zirbus,</hi> and covereth all the Guts downe to the ſhare.</p>
               <p>Two cauſes J find, why they were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. One is, that they ſhould defend the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratives outwardly. The ſecond is, that through his owne power and vertue, he ſhould ſtrengthen and comfort the digeſtion of all the Nutrates, becauſe they are more feebler then other members bee, becauſe they have but a thinne wombe or Skin, &amp;c. Next <hi>Zirbus</hi> appeareth the Intrails or guts, of which <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that the Guts were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the firſt Creation to convey the droſſe of the meate and drinke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to clenſe the body of ſuperfluities. And here it is to be noted, that there be fixe portions of one whole Gutte, which both in man and Beaſt beginneth at the nether mouth of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and ſo containeth forth to the end of the Fundament. Nevertheleſſe hee hath divers ſhapes and formes, and divers operations in the Body, and therefore he hath divers names. And hereupon the Philoſophers ſay, that the lower wombe of a man, is like unto the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:121645:43"/>
wombe of a Swine. And like as the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke hath two Tunicles, in like manner have all the Guts two Tunicles. The firſt portion of the Guts is called <hi>Duodenum;</hi> for he is 12. Inches of length, and covereth the nether part of the Stomacke, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth all the droſſe of the ſtomacke: The ſecond portion of the Guts is called <hi>Iejunium,</hi> for he is evermore empty, for to him lyeth evermore the Cheſt of the Gall, beating him ſore, and draweth forth of him all the droſſe, and clenſeth him cleane: the third portion or Gut, is called <hi>Yleon,</hi> or ſmall Gut, and is in length fifteene or ſixteene Cubits. In this Gut oftentimes falleth a diſeaſe called <hi>Yleaea Paſſio.</hi> The fourth Gut is called <hi>Monoculus,</hi> or blind Gut, and it ſeemeth to have but one hole or mouth, but it hath two, one neere unto the other, for by the one all things goe in, and by the other they goe out againe. The fift is called <hi>Colon,</hi> and receiveth all the droſſe deprived from all profitableneſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there commeth not to him any Veynes <hi>Miſeraices,</hi> as to the other. The ſixt and laſt, is called <hi>Rectum</hi> or <hi>Longaon,</hi> and he is ended in the Fundament, and hath in his nether end foure <hi>Muſcles,</hi> to hold, to open, to ſhut, and to put out, &amp;c. Next is to be noted of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:121645:43"/>
                  <hi>ſenterium,</hi> the which is nothing elſe but a tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of innumerable Veynes <hi>Miſeraices,</hi> ramefied of one Veyne called <hi>Porta Epates,</hi> covered and defended of Pannicles nnd Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments comming to the Intrails, with the back full of fatneſſe and Glandulus fleſh, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Stomacke is a member compound and Spermaticke, ſinnowy and ſenſible, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is made perfect the firſt digeſtion of Chile. This is a neceſſary member to all the Body, for if it faile in his working, all the members of the Body ſhall corrupt.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> ſayth, that the Stomacke was ordained principally for two cauſes. The firſt, that it ſhould be to all the members of the Body, as the earth is to all that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of the earth, that is, that it ſhould deſire ſufficient meate for all the whole Body. The ſecond is, that the ſtomacke ſhould bee a ſacke or Cheſt to all the Body for the meate, and as a Cooke to all the members of the Body. The ſtomacke is made of two Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, of which the inner is <hi>Nerveous,</hi> and the outer <hi>Carneous.</hi> This inner Pannicle hath <hi>Muſculus</hi> Longitudinals, that ſtretcheth along from the ſtomacke to the mouth, by the which he draweth to him meate and drinke, as it were hands. And hee hath Tranſverſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:121645:44"/>
will, for to with-hold or make retention. And alſo the outer Pannicle hath Latitudinall will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to expulſe and put out: and that by his heate he ſhould keepe the digeſtive vertue of the ſtomacke, and by other heates given by his Neighbours, as thus. It hath the Liver on the right ſide, chaſing and beating him with his lobes or figures: and the Splene on the left ſide, with his fatneſſe and Veynes, ſending to him Melancholy, to exerciſe his appetites: and about him is the heart, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him with his <hi>Artiers:</hi> Alſo the Braine ſending to him a Branch of <hi>Nerves</hi> to give him feeling. And he hath on the hinder part, deſcending from the parts of the backe many <hi>Lygaments,</hi> with the <hi>Artiers</hi> joyned to the Spondels of the Backe. The forme or figure of this Stomack is long, in likeneſſe of a Goord, crooked: and that both holes bee in the upper part of the body of it, becauſe there ſhould be no going out of it unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe things which are received into it. The quantity of the ſtomack commonly hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth two Pitchers of water, and it may ſuffer many paſſions, and the nether mouth of the ſtomacke is narrower then the upper, and that for three cauſes. The firſt cauſe is, that the upper receiveth meate great and boyſterous in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:121645:44"/>
ſubſtance, that there being made ſubtill, it might paſſe into the nether. The ſecond is, for by him paſſeth all the meates, with their chiloſity from the ſtomacke to the Liver. The third is, for that through him paſſeth all the droſſe of the ſtomack to the guts. And this ſufficeth for the Stomacke, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Liver is a principal member, and official, and of his firſt creation ſpermatick, complete in quantity of blood, of himſelf inſenſible, but by accidence he is inſenſible, &amp; in him is made the ſecond digeſtion, &amp; is lapped in a ſinowie Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle. And that he is a principal member, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth onely by the Philoſophers, by <hi>Avicen</hi> and <hi>Galen.</hi> And it is officiall as is the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and it is of ſpermatick matter, and ſinowie of the which is ingendred his Veines. And becauſe it was like in quantity, Nature hath added to it cruded blood, to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of ſufficient quantity, and is lapped in a ſinowie Pannicle. And why the Liver is crudded, is becauſe the Chile which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the Stomacke to the Liver, ſhould ſhould be turned into the colour of blood.</p>
               <p>And why the Liver was ordained, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that all the nutrimentall blood be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in him. The proper place of the Liver is under the falſe Ribbes in the right
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:121645:45"/>
ſide. The forme of the Liver is gibbous or bunchie on the backe ſide, and it is ſomewhat hollow like the inſide of an hand. And why it is ſo ſhapen, is, that it ſhould bee plyable to the ſtomacke (like as a hand doth to an Apple) to comfort her digeſtion, for his heate is to the ſtomacke, as the heate of the fire is to the Pot or Cauldron that hangeth over it.</p>
               <p>Alſo the Lungs is bound with his Pellikles to the Diafragma, and with ſtrong Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And alſo hee hath Coliganes with the ſtomacke and the Intrailes, and with the Heart and the Reynes, the Teſtikles and other members. And there are in him five Pellikles, like five fingers. <hi>Galen</hi> calleth the Liver <hi>Meſſa Sanguinaria,</hi> containing in it ſelfe foure ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Naturall and Nutrimentall. The Naturals is ſent with the blood to all parts of the body, to be engendred and nouriſhed. And the Nutrimentals be ſequeſtrate and ſent to places ordained for ſome helpings. Theſe are the places of the Humours, the blood in the Liver, Choller in the Cheſt or Gall, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy to the Splene, Flegme to the Lungs and the Junctures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the watery ſuperfluities to the Reynes and Veſike. And they goe with the Blood, and ſometime they putrifie and make Fevers, and ſome bee put out to the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:121645:45"/>
Skinne, and be reſolved by ſweat, or by Scabs, by Puſhes, or by Impoſtumes.</p>
               <p>And theſe foure naturall Humours (that is to ſay) Sanguine, Choler, Melancholy, and Flegme, be engendred and diſtributed in this manner: Firſt, yee ſhall underſtand, that from the Spermaticke matter of the Liver in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, there is engendred two great Veynes, of the which, the firſt and the greateſt is called <hi>Porta,</hi> and commeth from the concavity of the Liver, of whom ſpringeth all the ſmall Veynes <hi>Miſeraices:</hi> and theſe <hi>Miſeraices,</hi> be to <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> as the branches of a Tree bee to the ſtocke of a Tree. For ſome of them bee contained with the bottome of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke: ſome with <hi>Duodenum,</hi> ſome with <hi>Jejunium,</hi> ſome with <hi>Yleon,</hi> and ſome with <hi>Monoculus,</hi> or <hi>Saccus.</hi> And from all theſe Guts they bring to <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> the ſuccoſity of Chiley, going from the ſtomacke, and diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribute it into the ſubſtance of the Liver. And theſe Veynes <hi>Miſeraices,</hi> be innumerable. And in theſe Veynes begins the ſecond Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion and endeth in the Liver, like as it doth in the ſtomacke the firſt Digeſtion.</p>
               <p>So it proveth that <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> and <hi>Vena Miſeraices,</hi> ſerve to bring all the ſuccoſity of all the meat and drinke that paſſeth the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:121645:46"/>
to the Liver, and they ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thorough the ſubſtance of the Liver in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and all they ſtretch towards the gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous (or bowing part of the Liver,) and there they meete, and goe all into one Unity, and make the ſecond great Veyne, called <hi>Vena <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lis,</hi> or <hi>Concava,</hi> or <hi>Vena Ramoſa:</hi> all is one, and hee with his Roots draweth out all the bloud engendred from the Liver, and with his branches Ramefying upwards and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, carryeth and conveyeth it to all other Members of the Body to bee nouriſhed with, where is made perfect the third digeſtion. And alſo there goeth from the Liver Veynes, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſuperfluites of the third Digeſtion to their proper places, as it ſhall be declared here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeake of the Gall, or of the Cheſt of the Gall: It is an oſficiall member, and it is ſupermaticke and ſinowie, and hath in it a ſubtill Will, and it is a purſe or a Panniculer Veſikle in the hollowneſſe of the Liver, about the middle Pericle or Lobe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to receive the Cholericke ſuperfluities which are engendred in the Liver: The which purſe or bagge hath three holes or Neckes; By the firſt he draweth to him from the Liver the Choller, that the Blood be not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:121645:46"/>
hurt by the Choler. By the ſecond Necke hee ſendeth to the bottome of the ſtomacke Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, to further the Digeſtion of the ſtomacke. And by the third Necke hee ſendeth the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler regularly from one Gut to another, to clenſe them of their ſuperfluities and Droſſe: and the quantity of the purſe, may containe in it halfe a pinte, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And next is the Splene, or the Milte, the which is a ſpermaticke member, as are other members: and oſficiall, and is the receptory of the Melancholious ſuperfluities that are engendred in the Liver: and his place is on the left ſide, tranſverſly linked to the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and his ſubſtance is thinne. And two cauſes J<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> find, why hee was ordained there. The firſt is, that by the Melancholious ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities which are engendred of the Liver which hee draweth to him, hee is nouriſhed with. The ſecond cauſe is, that the nutritive Blood ſhould by him be made the more purer, and cleane, from the Droſſe and thickning of the Melancholy, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And next of the Reynes and Kidneyes: It is to be underſtood, that within the Region of the Nutrites backwards, are ordained the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes to clenſe the Blood from the watry ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, and they have each of them two
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:121645:47"/>
paſſages or holes, or neckes; by the one is drawne the water from <hi>Venakelis,</hi> by two Veynes which are called <hi>Vencae Aemulg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of the Kidneyes is Lazartus fleſh, having Longitudinall will, and their place is behind on each ſide of the Spondels, and they are two in number, and the right Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney lyeth ſomewhat higher then the left, and is bound faſt to the back with Lygaments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Philoſopher ſaith, that mans Kidneyes are like the Kidneyes of a Cow, full of hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities; and therefore the Sores of them are hard to cure. Alſo, they are more harder in ſubſtance, then any other fleſhly member, and that for two cauſes. One is, that hee be not much hurt of the ſharpneſſe of the Urine. The other is, that the ſame Urine that paſſeth from him, might the better bee altered and clenſed through the ſame. Alſo, there commeth from the Heart to each of the Kidneyes, an Artier that bringeth with him Blood, heat, ſpirit, Life. And in the ſame manner there commeth a Veyne from the Liver, that bringeth blood to nouriſh the Kidneyes, called Blood nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:121645:47"/>
The greaſe of the Kidneyes or Fatneſſe, is as of other members, but it is an officiall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, made of thin Blood, congealed and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through cold, and there is ordained the greater quantity in his place; becauſe it ſhould receive and temper the heat of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes, which they have of the byting ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the water.</p>
               <p>Now by the Kidneyes upon the Spondels paſſeth <hi>Venakelis,</hi> or <hi>Venacua,</hi> which is a Veyne of great ſubſtance; for hee receiveth all the Nutrimentall blood from the Liver, and from him paſſeth many ſmall Pipes on every ſide, and at the Spondell betweene the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, hee divideth himſelfe whole in two great branches, the one goeth into the one arme, and the other into the other, and there they devide themſelves into many Veynes and branches, as is declared in the Armes.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. The Anatomie of the Haunches and their parts.</head>
               <p>THe Haunches are the lower part of the Wombe, joyning to the Thighes and the ſecret members. And three things there are to be noted thereof. The firſt is, of the parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:121645:48"/>
the ſecond is of the parts contained, and the third is of the parts proceeding out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. The parts containing outwardly, be <hi>Myrac</hi> and <hi>Syfac,</hi> the <hi>Zirbus</hi> and the bones. The part contained outwardly, are the <hi>Vezike,</hi> or Bladder: the Spermaticke veſſels, the <hi>Matrix</hi> in women, <hi>Longaon,</hi> Nerves, Veynes, and Artiers, deſcending downewards; The parts proceeding outwards, are the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks and the Muſcles, deſcending to the Thighes, of which it is to bee ſpoken of in order. And firſt of the parts containing: as of <hi>Myrac, Syfac,</hi> and <hi>Zirbus,</hi> there is enough ſpoken of in the Anatomy of the Wombe. But as for the Bones of the Hanches, there bee in the parts of the back three Spondels of <hi>Oſſa ſacri,</hi> or of the Hanches: and three <hi>Cartali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis</hi> Spondels of <hi>Oſſa Cande,</hi> called the Taile-bone.</p>
               <p>And thus it is proved, that there is in every man thirty Spondels, and thus they are to be numbred: in the Necke ſeaven, in the Ridge twelue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Reynes five: and in the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſixe: And it is to be noted, that every Spondell is hollow in the middeſt: through which hollowneſſe paſſeth <hi>Nuca</hi> from the Braine, or the Marrow of the Backe. And ſome Authors ſay, that <hi>Mynuca</hi> is of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:121645:48"/>
that the Braine is of: For it is like in ſubſtance, and in it ſelf giveth to the Nerves both the vertue of Moving and Feeling.</p>
               <p>And alſo every Spondell is holden on every ſide, through the which holes, both Artiers and Veynes doe bring from the Heart and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver both Life and nouriſhment, like as they doe to the Braine; and from the Pannicle of <hi>Mynuca,</hi> or the Marrow of the back, through the holes of the ſides of the Spondels, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth Nerves motives, and there they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingle themſelves with the ſtrong Lyga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that be inſenſible, and ſo the Lygaments receive that feeling of the Nerves, which the Nerves taketh of <hi>Mynuca.</hi> And by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon many Authors prove, that <hi>Mynuca</hi> is of the ſame ſubſtance that the Braine is of, and the Pannicles of the <hi>Nuca</hi> is of the ſame ſubſtance of the Pannicles of the Braine, &amp;c. And each of theſe Spondels bee bound fall one with another, ſo that one of them may not well bee named without another. And ſo all theſe Spondels together, contained one by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other are called the Ridge-bone, which is the foundation of all the ſhape of the Body. They with the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t Spondell be contained or joyned to the Bones of the Haunches, and they be the upholders of all the Spondels. And theſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:121645:49"/>
Bones bee ſmall towards the Taile-bone, and broad towards the Hanches, and before they joyne and make <hi>Os Pectinis.</hi> And ſo they bee broad in the parts of the <hi>Jles,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome Authors calleth it <hi>Ylea.</hi> And each of theſe two Bones towards the Liver hath a great round hole, into which is received the Bone called <hi>Vertebra,</hi> or the Whorlebone. Alſo beſides that place there is a great hole or way, thorow the which paſſeth from above Muſculus Veynes and Artiers, and goe into the Thighes. And thus it is to bee noted, that of this Bone <hi>Pecten,</hi> and the Bone <hi>Vertebra,</hi> is made the juncture of the Thigh.</p>
               <p>Now to ſpeake of the parts contained, the firſt thing that commeth to ſight is the Bladder, the which is an officiall member, compound of two Nervous Pannicles, in complexion cold and dry, whoſe Necke is carnous, and hath Muſcles to with-hold, and to let goe: and in man it is long, and is contained with the yard, paſſing through <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> but in women it is ſhorter, and is contained with the <hi>Vulva.</hi> The place of the Bladder, is betweene the bone of the Share and the Tayle-gut, called <hi>Longaon,</hi> and in women, it is betweene the aforeſaid bone and the Matrix.</p>
               <p>And in it is implanted two long veſſels
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:121645:49"/>
comming from the Kidneyes, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e names be <hi>Porri Vrikcides,</hi> bringing with them the Urine or water from the Kidneys to the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which privily entreth into the holes of the Pannicles of the Bladder, by a naturall moving betweene Tunicle and Tunicle, and there the Urine findeth the hole of the nether Tunicle, and there it entreth privily into the concavity of the bladder, and the more that the Bladder is filled with Urine, the ſtraiter bee the two Pannicles compriſed together; for the holes of the Tunicles, be not even one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another; and therefore if the bladder be never ſo full, there may none goe backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The forme of it is round, the quantity of it is a Pitcher full, in ſome more, in ſome leſſe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Alſo there is found two other veſſels, called <hi>Vaza Seminaria,</hi> or the Spermaticke Veſſels. And they come from <hi>Venakelis,</hi> bringing blood to the Teſtikles, as well in Man, as in Woman, the which by his further digeſtion it is made ſperme or nature in men: they be put outward for the Teſtikles be without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in women it abideth within, for their. Teſtikles ſtand within: as it ſhall be declared here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Next followeth the Matrix in women: the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:121645:50"/>
Matrix in women is an officiall member, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and Nerveous, and in complexion cold and dry: and it is the field of mans generation, and it is an inſtrument ſuſceptive, that is to ſay, a thing receiving or taking: and her proper place is betweene the Bladder and the Gut <hi>Longaon,</hi> the likeneſſe of it, is as it were a yard reverſed and turned inward, having Teſtikles likewiſe, as aforeſaid. Alſo the Matrix hath two Concavities or Selles, and no more, but all Beaſts have as many Selles as they have Pappes-heads. Alſo it hath a long Necke like an Urinall, and in every Necke it hath a mouth, that is to ſay, one within, and another without. The inner in the time of conception is ſhut, and the outer part is open as it was before: and it hath in the middeſt a Lazartus Pannicle, which is called in Latine <hi>Tengit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> And in the creation of this Pannicle, is found two utilities. The firſt is, that by it goeth forth the Urine, or elſe it ſhould bee ſhed throughout all the <hi>Vulva:</hi> The ſecond is, that when a woman doth ſet her Thighs abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it altereth the ayre that commeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Matrix for to temper the heate.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the Necke that is betweene theſe two aforeſaid mouthes, in her concavity
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:121645:50"/>
hath many involuſions and pleates, joyned together in the manner of Roſe-leaves before they be fully ſpread or ripe, and ſo they be ſhut together as a purſe mouth, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may paſſe forth but urine, untill the time of Childing. Alſo about the middle of this necke be certaine Veynes in Maydens, the which in time of deflowring, be corrupted and broken. Furthermore, in the ſides of the outer mouth, are two Teſticles or Stones, and alſo two veſſels of Sperme, ſhorter then mans veſſels, and in time of Coyt the Womans ſperme is ſhead downe in the bottome of the Matrix. Alſo from the Liver there commeth to the Matrix many Veynes, bringing to the Child nouriſhing at the time of a womans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Child: and thoſe Veynes, at ſuch time as the Matrix is voyd, bring thereto ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities from certaine members of the Body, whereof are engendred womans Flowers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch, as it hath pleaſed Almighty God to give the knowledge of theſe his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and Workes unto his Creatures in this preſent World. Heere J ſuppoſe to declare what thing <hi>Embreon</hi> is, and his Creation. The noble Philoſophers, as <hi>Galen, Avicen, Bartholmeus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and divers others, writing upon this matter, ſay: That Embreon is a thing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:121645:51"/>
in the Mothers wombe, the origin all whereof is, the Sperme of the Man and of the Woman, of the which is made by the might and power of GOD, in the mothers wombe a Child: as hereafter more at large ſhall bee declared. Firſt, the field of Generation called the Matrix, or the Mother, is knowne in the Anatomy, whoſe place is properly (betwixt the Bladder and Longaon) in the Woman, in which place is ſowne by the Tillage of man, a covenable matter of kindly heate: For kindly heate is cauſe efficient both of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and working, and Spirit that giveth vertue to the Body, and governeth and ruleth that vertue: the which Seed of generation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from all the parts of the Body, both of the Man and Woman, with conſent and will of all Members, and is ſhead in the place of Conceiving, where thorow the vertue of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is gathered together in the Celles of the Matrix or the Mother, in whom by the way of the working of mans Seede, and by the way of ſuffering of the Womans Seed mixt together, ſo that each of them worketh in other, and ſuffereth in other, there is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred Embreon. And further it is to bee noted, that this Sperme that commeth both to man and woman, is made and gathered of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:121645:51"/>
moſt beſt and pureſt drops of Blood in all the body, and by the labour and chafing of the Teſtikles or Stones, this Blood is turned into another kind, and is made Sperme. And in man it is hot, white, and thicke: wherefore it may not ſpread nor runne abroad of it ſelfe, but runneth and taketh temperance of the Womans ſperme which hath contrary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: For the womans ſperme is thinner, colder, and feebler.</p>
               <p>And as ſome Authors hold opinion, when this matter is gathered into the right ſide of the Matrix, then it happeneth a Male-kind, and likewiſe on the left the Female, and where the vertue is moſt, there it favoureth moſt. And further it is to bee noted, that like as the Renet of the Cheeſe hath by himſelfe the way or vertue of working, ſo hath the Milke by way of ſuffering: and as the Renet and milke make the Cheeſe, ſo doth the ſperme of Man and Woman make the generation of Embreon, of the which thing ſpringeth (by the vertue of kindly heate) a certaine Skin or Caule, into the which it lappeth it ſelfe in, wherewith afterwards it is tyed to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wombe, the which covering commeth forth with the byrth of the Childe: and if it happen that any of the Skinne remaine after
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:121645:52"/>
the byrth of the Child, then is the Woman in perill of her life.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, (it is ſaid) that of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breon is ingendred the Heart, the Liver, the Braynes, Nerves, Veynes, Arteirs, Chords, Lygaments, Skins, Griſtles, and Bones, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving to them by kindly vertue the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruall blood, of which is engendred both fleſh and fatneſſe. And as Writers ſay, the firſt thing that is ſhapen, be the principals: as is the Heart, Liver, and Braine. For of the Heart ſpringeth the Artiers: of the Liver, the Veines: and of the Brain, the Nerves: and when theſe are made, Nature maketh and ſhapeth both Bones and Griſtles to keepe and ſave them, as the bones of the head for the Brain: the Breaſt Bones, and the Ribbes, for the Heart and the Liver. And after theſe ſpringeth all other members one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and thus is the Child bred forth in foure degrees, as thus. The firſt is, when the ſaid Sperme or Seed is at the firſt as it were Milke. The ſecond is, when it is turned from that kind into another kind, is yet but as a lumpe of Blood, and this is called of <hi>Hypocrates, Fettus.</hi> The third degree is, when the principals be ſhapen, as the Heart, Liver, and Braine. The fourth and laſt, as when all the other members
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:121645:52"/>
bee perfectly ſhapen, then it receiveth the Soule, with Life and Breath, and then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to move it ſelfe alone. Now in theſe foure degrees aforeſaid, in the firſt as Milke, it continueth ſeven dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the ſecond as <hi>Fettus,</hi> nine dayes: in the third, as a lumpe of Fleſh engendring the principals, the ſpace of nine dayes: and in the fourth, unto the time of full perfection of all the whole members, is the ſpace of eighteene dayes: So is there fixe and forty dayes from the day of Conception, unto the day of full perfection and receiving of the Soule, as God beſt knoweth.</p>
               <p>Now to come againe to the Anatomy of the Haunches: Then come wee to <hi>Longaon,</hi> otherwiſe called the Taile-gut, whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is Pannicular, as of all the other Bowels: the length of it is of a ſpan long ſtretching nigh to the Reynes, his nether part is called <hi>Annis,</hi> (that is to ſay) the Towell: and about him is found two Muſcles, the one to open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other to ſhut.

               <p>And when this <hi>Longaon</hi> is raiſed up, then ye may ſee the Veynes and Artiers, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:121645:53"/>
how they bee branched and bound down to the nether parts: the parts proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outwardly, are <hi>Didimus Peritoneum,</hi> the Yard, the Teſtikles, and Buttocks. And firſt, it ſhall be ſpoken of the Yard, or of mans generative members, the which dureth unto that part that is called <hi>Peritoneum,</hi> the which place is from the Coddes, unto the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereupon is a ſeame. Wherefore ſaith the Philoſopher, mans Yard is in the end and terme of the ſhare.</p>
               <p>The Yard is an officiall member, and the Tiller of mans generation, compound, and made of Skin, Brawnes, Tendons, Veynes, Arteirs, Sinewes, and great Lygaments: and it hath in it two paſſages, or principall iſſues, one for the Sperme, and another for the Urine. And as the Philoſophers ſay, the quantity of a common yard, is eight or nine Inches, with meaſurable bigneſſe proportioned to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Matrix.</p>
               <p>This member hath (as <hi>Avicen</hi> ſaith) three holes, through one paſſeth inſenſible poliſions and wind, that cauſeth the Yard to riſe: the other two holes is declared before. Alſo the yard hath a Skinne, and about the head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it is double, and that men call <hi>Praeputium;</hi> and this Skinne is moveable, for through his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:121645:53"/>
conſecration the Spermaticke matter is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſooner gathered together, and ſooner caſt forth from the Teſtikles; for by him, is had the moſt delectation in the doing. And the foremoſt part of the head of the Yard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is made of a brawny fleſh, the which if it bee once loſt, it is never reſtored againe, but it may be well skinned, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Coddes is a compound member, and an officiall, and though it bee counted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the generative members, yet it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a principall member, becauſe of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. This Purſe was ordained for the cuſtody and comfort of the Teſtikles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spermaticke veſſels: and it is alſo made of two parts, of inner and of the outer.</p>
               <p>The outer is compound and made of Skinne, and Lazartus. Longitudinall and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, in like manner as the <hi>Myrac.</hi> The inner part of the Cods is of the ſubſtance of the <hi>Sifac,</hi> and are in ſimilitude as two pockets drawne together by themſelves, and they differ not from the <hi>Syfac:</hi> and there bee two, becauſe if there fall any hurt to the one, the other ſhould ſerve. The Teſtikles or ſtones bee two, made of Glandulus fleſh, or Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelly fleſh. And furthermore, through the <hi>Didimus,</hi> commeth the Teſtikles from the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:121645:54"/>
Braine, Sinewes, and from the Heart Artiers, and from the Liver Veynes, bringing unto them both feeling and ſtirring, Life, and Spirit, and Nutrimentall blood, and the moſt pureſt blood of all other members of the Body, whereof is made the Sperme by the labour of the Teſtikles, the which is put forth in due time, as is before rehearſed.</p>
               <p>The Groynes bee knowne: they bee the empty Junctures, or purging place unto the Liver, and they have curnelly fleſh in the ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or bowing of the Thighes. The Hippes have great brawny fleſh on them, and from thence deſcend downwards, Brawns, Chords, and Lygaments, moving and binding together the Thighes, with the Haunches themſelues.</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. The Anatomie of the Thighes, Legges, and Feet.</head>
               <p>THE Legge reacheth from the Joynt of the Thigh unto the extremity of the Toes, and J will divide it in parts, as the Armes were divided. One part is called <hi>Coxa,</hi> or Thigh, and that is all that is contained from the joynt of the Haunch unto the Knee. The ſecond part is called <hi>Tibia,</hi> and that reacheth
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:121645:54"/>
from the Knee to the Ankle. The third is the little foot, and that is from the Anckle, unto the end of the Toes. And heere it is to bee noted, that the Thigh, Legge, and foot, are compound, and made as the great Arme or hand, with Skin, Fleſh, Veynes, Artiers, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, Brawnes, Tendons, and Bones where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are to be ſpoken of in order.</p>
               <p>Of the Skinne and Fleſh there is enough ſpoken of before. And as of Veynes and Arteirs in their deſcending downwards, at the laſt Spondels they bee divided into two parts, whereof the one part goeth into the right Thigh, and the other into the Left: And when they come to the Thigh, they be divided in other two great Branches: the one of them ſpreadeth into the inner ſide of the Legge, and the other ſpreadeth into the outer ſide, and ſo branching, deſcend downe to the Legge, to the Anckles, and Feet, and bee brought into foure Veynes, which be commonly uſed in letting Blood, as hereafter followeth.</p>
               <p>One of them is under the inner Ankle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the heel, called <hi>Soffena,</hi> and another under the outer Ankle, called <hi>Siarica,</hi> and another under the Hamme, called <hi>Poplitica,</hi> the fourth, betweene the little Toe, and the next, called <hi>Renalis.</hi> And it is to be noted of theſe foure
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:121645:55"/>
great Veynes in the Legges, of the manifold dangers that might fall of them as oft it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. There bee many other branches which a Chirurgion needeth not much to paſſe upon. The Sinewes ſpring of the laſt Spondell, and of <hi>Os Sacrum,</hi> and paſſeth through the hole of the bone of the Hippe, and deſcendeth to the Brawnes, and moveth the Knee and the Hamme, and theſe deſcend downe to the Ankle, and move the Foot, and the brawnes of the Feet move the Toes in like manner, as is declared in the bones of the Hand. The firſt is called <hi>Coxa,</hi> that is the Thigh-bone, and he is without a fellow, and he is full of Marrow, and is round at either end. The roundneſſe that is at the upper end, is called <hi>Vertebrum,</hi> or Whyrlebone, and boweth inwards, and is received into the Concavities of the bone of the Legge at the Knee, called the great Foſſels. There is alſo at the Knee a round bone, called the Knee-panne. Then followes the Legge, wherein is two bones, called <hi>Focile Major,</hi> and <hi>Focile Minor,</hi> the bigger of them paſſeth before making the ſhape of the ſhinne, and it is called the Shin-bone, and paſſeth downe, making the inner ankle. The leſſe paſſeth from the Knee backwards, deſcending downe to the outer Anckle, and there formeth that
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:121645:55"/>
Ankle, &amp;c. The bones of the Feet are ſixe and twenty: as thus. Firſt, next the Ankle bone, is one called in Latine <hi>Orabaliſtus:</hi> Next under that, towards the Heele is one, called <hi>Galeani:</hi> and betweene them is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bone, called <hi>Os Nauculare.</hi> In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ward there be foure bones called <hi>Raceti,</hi> as be in the hands. In the third and fourth wards be foureteene, called <hi>Digitori:</hi> and five called <hi>Pectens,</hi> at the extremities of the Toes, next to the Nailes. And thus be there in the Foot, ſixe and twenty bones, with the Legge from the Ankle to the Knee, two in the knee, and one round and flat bone, and in the Thigh, one. And thus you ſhall find in the whole Leg and Foot thirty bones. And this may ſerve for young Practitioners in the Anatomie.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Wound is a ſolution, ſeperation and recent breach of unity, of that that before was a continuity with out putrified matter, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption giveth the name of an Ulcer to the ſolution, and no more a Wound.</p>
               <p>The cauſes of Wounds are duall, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt by the violence of bodies without life, as we ſimply call an Inciſed wound, as when it is cauſed by edged Inſtruments. Secondly, we call it a Stab or puncture, cauſed by theforce of Daggers and the like. Thirdly, we call thoſe Contuſed wounds, cauſed by violent uſe of the object, being ſome weighty thing (caſt as a Stone, or ſtroake with a Staffe, or their ſimilies) againſt the ſubject receiving their forces, differing in their appellations by the diverſity of their cauſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:121645:71"/>
Or ſecondly, wounds are cauſed by living things, as a wound that is of Biting, ſcratching and the like, and for theſe cauſes they differ in their appellatious.</p>
               <p>Alſo the differencie of Wounds, are taken eyther from their cauſes by which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, or from their accidents, <hi>viz.</hi> the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the place wherein they are ſcituated. Alſo, the place maketh difference thus: eyther they happen in the ſimilar parts, as the Fleſh, Artery, Veyne, &amp;c. or in the organicall or inſtrumentall parts, as ſome intire and whole bulke, truncke, or fully compleat member, or limbe, <hi>viz.</hi> The Head, Necke, Breſt, Belly, &amp;c. Wounds of the Head grow more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, becauſe that parts belonging thereto be of more note; as the Face, Noſe, Lippes, Eyes, and Eares: wounds of the limbes, arc of the Shoulders, Armes, Thighes, and Legs. Of the ſimilar parts alſo, ſome are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine, as the fleſh, whoſe wounds are eyther ſimple, deepe, hollow, plaine, or proud with fleſh. The Spermaticke likewiſe, are eyther hard or ſoft; the ſoft parts, as the Veynes, Arteries, and Sinewes, being wounded, we call them wounds of the hurt part; the hard are the Bones, a breach of which, we call a wound in the Bone.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:121645:71"/>
So Wounds derive their Nominations from the cauſe, place and ſimiſitudes thereof.</p>

For ſome goe right, ſome overthwart, that offend divers places of the body: The ſimple are of ſmall importance, if they keepe them cleane and cloſe ſhut Nature will heale, them, without any kind of medecine: but thoſe where veynes are cut, had neede of ſome Art or Practiſe, with the which they muſt ſtop the blood, and in any wiſe not to ſuffer the wound to remaine open but to ſow it up very cloſe, ſo that the veyne may heale, and thoſe where ſinewes are hurt are of great importance, and would be healed with great ſpeed, ſo the Sinewes

But thoſe where bones are hurt, are of great importance, for if the Bone be ſeperated from the other, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity it muſt be taken forth before the Wound be healed: So that by this meanes every one may know, what Wounds are and their kinds.</p>

The firſt thing that is to be done in thoſe Wounds, is to joyne the parts cloſe together, and dreſſe them upon the wound with our <hi>Oleum Benedictum,</hi> and upon the Oyle lay cloathes wet in our <hi>Magno Licore,</hi> as hot as you can ſuffer it: And ſo with the Remedies thou ſhalt helpe them quickly: becauſe our <hi>Oleo Benedicto</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough there be a very excellent and wholſome Bath within the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> yet for all that, J am certain that there are many in the North parts, which being diſeaſed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore Diſeaſes, would very
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:121645:114"/>
gladly goe to the Bath of <hi>Bathe,</hi> if they knew the vertue and benefit thereof whereby they might receive eaſe and remedy.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, ſeeing that J have writ of the Baths that are in foraigne Countries, therefore J thought good to make knowne the vertues of our owne Bathes; For if they bee able to help and cure mens Diſeaſes, to what purpoſe ſhall men need to goe into farre Countries to ſeeke for that remedy there which they might have at home.</p>
            <p>The Bath of <hi>England</hi> is in the Weſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in <hi>Somerſet</hi>-ſhire, in a City called in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>Bathonia,</hi> and <hi>Bathe</hi> in Engliſh, of the Bathes that are in it. This City of <hi>Bathe</hi> is 15. miles from <hi>Welles,</hi> and 15. miles from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble City of <hi>Briſtow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The chiefe matter whereof theſe Bathes in this City have their chiefe vertue and ſtrength, after my judgement is Brimſtone, and of my judgement are divers other, which have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined them as J have done; when J was at the Bathes with a certaine man diſeaſed of the Gout, J went into them my ſelfe with my Patient, and brought forth of the place next unto the Spring, and out of the bottome, ſlime, mudde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bones, and ſtones, which altogether ſmelled evidently of Brimſtone, if that a man
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:121645:114"/>
may judge the matter by the effect; may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Brimſtone is the onely matter in theſe Bathes, or at leaſt the chiefe that beareth rule in them; for they dry up wonderfully, and giveth great eaſe and cureth the Gout excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and that in a ſhort time, as with divers others (and Gentlemen of quality) can beare witneſſe thereof: Which things are no ſlight manifeſtations that Brimſtone beareth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy and chiefe rule; ſeeing that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſmelling nor taſting, a man can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any other matter or Minerall to raigne there.</p>
            <p>If there bee any thing elſe lightly mingled with the Brimſtone (which J could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly diſtinguiſh) it muſt be Copper; for in my abode as J walked about the Mountaines, out of the which the Bathes doe ſpring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> J found here and there little pieces of Marqueſieth and ſtones mingled with Copper, but J could by no ſence or wit perceive, that the Bathes had any notable quality thereof. Then ſeeing that there cannot bee found any other Minerall or matter to be the chiefe ruler in theſe Bathes then Brimſtone, wee may gather, that theſe Bathes are good for all thoſe Diſeaſes, which all learned Phyſitians write, that other Bathes, whoſe chiefe ruler is Brimſtone, are good for.</p>

               <hi>Aetius</hi> writing of naturall Bathes, wherein Brimſtone is eyther the only Minerall or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, or chiefe ruler thereof, ſaith thus as followeth. The Bathes of Brimſtone ſoften the Sinewes, ſwage the Paine that a man hath in deſiring to goe oft unto the ſtoole, and when hee commeth, he can either doe litle or nothing at all. They ſcowre and cleanſe the Skinne; wherefore they are good for the white Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew and blacke, for the Leproſie, and for all Scabs and Scurffes, for old Sores and Botches, for the falling of humours into the Joynts, for an hardened Mylt, or the Cake in the left ſide, for an hardened Mother, for all kind of Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, for the Sciatica, and for all kind of Itch or Itching.

            <p>The Bathes of Brimſtone doe ſoften the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes and doe heat, they are good therefore for Palſies, for places ſhrunke or pulled in too much, or ſtretched too farre forth; for the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or trembling of any member, and they ſwage Ache, and drawes out the ſwelling of the Limbes, and drive and diſſolve them away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:121645:115"/>
They are good therefore for the Gout in the hands, for the Gout in the feet, and for the Sciatica, and all other diſeaſes in the joynts: they ſwage alſo the paines in the Liver and Milt, and drive away the ſwelling of them both: they ſcowre away Freckles, and heale Morphewes, and Scabbes. But they undoe and overthrow the Stomacke. Then ſeeing (as J ſaid before) our Baths of <hi>Bathe,</hi> have their vertue of Brimſtone, they that are diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any of the above-named diſeaſes, may goe thither, and by the helpe of Almighty God be healed there.</p>
            <p>Though thoſe Bathes have of long time beene knowne, even about a thouſand yeares, either unlearnedneſſe, or the enviouſneſſe of the Phyſitians, which have been in times paſt, is greatly to be rebuked, becauſe either for lack of Learning, they knew not the vertue of thoſe Bathes, or elſe for enviouſneſſe, would not ſend the ſicke folkes, whom they could not otherwiſe heale unto the Bathes; for all men can tell, very few in times paſt have beene by the adviſe of the Phyſitians ſent unto the Bathes, but now in this our light and learned time, after that ſo many learned Phyſitians have ſo greatly commended theſe Bathes. J doubt whether the niggardly liberality, or the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:121645:116"/>
unnaturall unkindneſſe of the rich men of <hi>England</hi> is more to be diſpraiſed, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſo many good turnes of Almighty God, now after that they know that the Bathes are ſo profitable, will not beſtowe one halfe-penny for Gods ſake upon the bettering and amending of them, that the poore, ſicke and diſeaſed people that reſort thither, might be better and ſooner holp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He that hath beene in <hi>Jtalie</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and had ſeene how coſtly and wel-favoredly, the Bathes are trimmed, and appointed there in divers and ſundry places, would be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that any ſtranger which had ſeene the Bathes in foraigne lands ſhould looke upon our Bathes, for hee would thinke that the ſtranger would accuſe us Engliſhmen of three things. Of groſſeneſſe and brutiſh Ignorance; becauſe we cannot trim our Bathes no better. Of unkindneſſe, becauſe we doe ſo lightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſo high and excellent gifts of Almighty God. Of beaſtly filthineſſe, becauſe we make no partition between the Men and the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whileſt they are in Bathing, but ſuffer them contrary both unto the law of God and man, to goe together like unreaſonable Beaſts, to the deſtruction both of body and ſoule of many.</p>

               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:121645:116"/>
Firſt, and before all other things, my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell is, that every Bath have an hole in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, by the which, the ſtopple taken out, the Bath ſhould be cleanſed and ſcowred every foure and twenty houres, at the leaſt once, and that I would adviſe to be done at eight a clock in the afternoone, that againſt the Morning it might be full of freſh and wholeſome water againſt the time the ſicke folke come to it in the morning, and ſo ſhould they be a great deale ſooner healed of their old diſeaſes, and in leſſe jeopardie in taking of new, which may eaſily come unto a man, if he goe into a Bath, wherein a ſicke man (namely if hee be ſicke n a ſmiting or infective diſeaſe) hath continued.</p>
            <p>And for the Dyet that men ſhould keepe at this Bath of <hi>Bathe,</hi> hereafter enſueth; with divers other neceſſary Rules needfull to bee obſerved of all thoſe that enter into the ſaid Bath, or drinke the water of any Bath.</p>

Sickneffe, except it bee ſuch a one as that the learned Phyſitians almoſt diſpaire of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it. If God have ſmitten you with any Diſeaſe, before you goe to any Bath for the healing of it, call to your remembrance how often and wherein you have diſpleaſed GOD, and if any of your ſinnes come to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, exerciſe the ſame no more but be heartily ſorie for it, and deſire of God forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for it, intending and promiſing by his mercy and grace never to fall into the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.

Leave off from ſinne, and order thy hands aright, and clenſe thy heart from all wickedneſſe. Then give place to the Phyſitian, and let him come unto thee, as one that God hath ſent unto thee.</hi> And a little after hee doth plainly declare, that Sickneſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the puniſhment of ſinne, where hee ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Hee that ſinneth againſt his Maker, let him fall into the hands of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian.</hi> As Chriſt in the 5. of <hi>John</hi> doth alſo manifeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when he ſaid unto the blind man he had healed; <hi>Goe and ſinne no more, leſt worſe things chance nnto thee.</hi>

Howbeit, wee may judge no man to bee a greater ſinner then another, becauſe hee is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſicke then the common ſort be; for God ſendeth unto good men oftentimes ſickne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For if that many Infirmities had been a ſure token that ſuch a man were a greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But whether Sickneſſe come for to puniſh ſinne, or to hold a man in good nature and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, all Sickneſſe commeth from GOD; Therefore, for whatſoever cauſe it commeth of, before ye aske any helpe of any worldly Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, yee muſt make your Prayers to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD, (as the good King <hi>Ezechias</hi> did,) and if it be meet for you to be healed, you ſhall be healed as he was.</p>
               <p>Then before yee goe into the Bathes, in any wiſe ye muſt goe to ſome learned Phyſitian, and learne of him, by the helpe of ſhewing, what Complexion you be of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our or other thing is the cauſe of your diſeaſe; and there after his Counſell, uſe ſuch Dyet as
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:121645:118"/>
ſhall be moſt fit for your Complexion and ſickneſſe. Let no man enter into any Bath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his body be purged or cleanſed after the advice of ſome learned Phyſitian, for if any man goe into the bath unpurged, he may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune never come home againe: or if he come home againe, he commeth home moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly with worſe Diſeaſes then he brought to the bath with him.</p>
               <p>Yee may not goe into the bath, the firſt day that you are come to it, but you muſt reſt a day or two, and then goe into the bathe.</p>
               <p>There is no time of the yeare that is more fit to goe into the moſt part of all the bathes, then are the Moneths of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>September:</hi> but the Spring time is better then any other time is.</p>
               <p>The beſt time of the day is an houre after the riſing of the Sunne, or halfe an houre: but before yee goe into the bathe, if your diſeaſe will ſuffer you, yee muſt walke an houre, or at the leaſt halfe an houre before you goe into the bath.</p>
               <p>But you muſt at no time goe into the bath, except yee have beene at the ſtoole, either by nature or by art; yee may take a Suppoſitory, or a Gliſter, and for a great need <hi>Savanorolla</hi> ſuffereth Pils, but hee will not ſuffer that he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:121645:118"/>
that is ſo purged, enter into the bath, for the ſpace of foureteene houres.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author alſo, would at the leaſt every Bather ſhould have a ſtoole once in three dayes: wherefore if any man be hard of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and cannot abide Suppoſitories and Gliſters, he pardoneth the Patient, if he be once purged, or goe to the ſtoole in three dayes, which thing ſcarcely any other writer that J have read will doe, neither would J counſell any Patient to deferre the going to ſtoole ſo long, if there be any meanes poſſible to make a man goe to the ſtoole, without his great paine.</p>
               <p>If that he be counſelled to goe twice on a day into the Bathe, he muſt ſee he goe not into it, till ſeaven houres be paſt after your dinner, and tarry not ſo long in it in the afternoone as you did before.</p>
               <p>The common time of tarrying in the bath, is commonly allowed to be an houre or more or leſſe, according to the nature both of the Bath, as alſo of the Patient.</p>
               <p>Let no man tarry ſo long in the Bath that he be faint or weak, but let him come out before that time.</p>
               <p>Yee muſt alwayes goe into the bath with an empty ſtomack, and as long as you are in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:121645:119"/>
it, you muſt neither eate nor drinke except that great need require the contrary.</p>
               <p>Some grant that a weake perſon may eate a little bread ſteeped in the juyce of Pome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granats, Barberries, or Rilts, or in the Syrups made of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Some Phyſitians ſuffer a man that cannot abide hunger ſo long, to take ere he goe in, two ſpoonfuls of Raiſons well waſhed often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with two parts of water, one of wine, or ſo much of delaied or watred wine, as much as can be holden in a ſpoone, or a few Prunes ſodden and ſteeped in water, or two ſpoonfuls of crummes of bread, waſhed oftentimes with water or wine, tempered as J told before, or a toſte put into ſuch water: but let no man drinke in the Bath, except he ſwound in the bath, or bee in danger of ſounding, or elſe ye muſt all the time that ye be in the bath, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from all meate and drinke.</p>
               <p>As long as you are in the bath, you muſt cover your head well that you take no cold, for it is very perilous to take cold in the head in the Bath, as divers reaſons may be laid to prove the ſame.</p>
               <p>When you come out of the Bath, ſee that yee cover your ſelf well that ye take no cold, and dry off the Water on your body with
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:121645:119"/>
warme clothes, and goe by and by into a warme bed, and ſweat there if you can, and wipe off the ſweat diligently, and afterwards ſleepe, but yee muſt not drinke any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till dinner time, except ye be very faint: then ye may take a little Suger-candy, or a few Raiſins, or any ſuch thing in a ſmall quantity that will ſlake thirſt: for <hi>Galen</hi> in the 14 <hi>De Methodo medendi,</hi> commandeth that a man ſhall not eate nor drinke by and by after the Bathe, untill he hath ſlept after his bathing.</p>
               <p>After that yee have ſweat and ſlept enough, and be clearely delivered from the heate that you had in the Bathe, and afterwards in the Bed, then may you reſt and walke a little, and then goe to dinner; for by meaſurable walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the vapours and windineſſe that is come in the Bath is driven away.</p>
               <p>If the Patient cannot walke, then let him be rubd quickly, and if hee can ſuffer no rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then at ſome time it were good to take a a Suppoſitorie, either of Roote, or of a Beete, with a little Salt upon it, or a Suppoſitory of Honey, or a Suppoſitorie of a Flower deluce, or of ſalt Bacon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or white Sope.</p>
               <p>After all theſe things, then ſhall you goe to dinner, but you muſt neither eate very much good meate, nor any evill meate at all.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:121645:120"/>
Wherefore you muſt riſe from the Table with ſome good appetite, ſo that you could eate more if you would.</p>
               <p>The meates that are commonly of all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians allowed that write of Dyet that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to Bathes, are, Bread of a dayes baking, or two at the moſt, well leavened, and throughly baked, ſmall Birds, and other birds of the fields and mountaines that are of eaſie digeſtion, (but Waterchanters yee muſt not touch) Kids-fleſh, Veale and Mutton, or a Lambe of a yeare old, new laid Egges, Phea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, Partridges, Capons, Chickens and young Geeſe. The meates that are forbidden, are ſalt Beefe and Bacon, Pidgeons, Quailes, Pyes, and Paſties, and ſuch like meates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cherries, and all ſuch fruits, Garlicke, Onions, and all hot ſpices, and all cold meates, as are the moſt part of Fiſhes: howbeit, divers may be well allowed, ſo they be well dreſſed.</p>
               <p>Milke is not to be allowed much: but if that the Patient be ſo greedy of it, that in a manner he long for it, then let him take it two houres or thereabout, before he take any other meate, and he muſt drinke after it.</p>
               <p>White wine that is ſmall is allowable, or Wine delayed with the third or fourth part of ſodden water, according to the Complexion
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:121645:120"/>
of the Patient: Some uſe to ſteepe bread in ſtrong Wine, when as they can get no other Wine.</p>
               <p>Beware that in no wiſe ye drinke any water, and eſpecially cold water, and ſo ſhould yee forbeare from all things that are preſently cold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> namely, when ye begin firſt to eate and drinke. Let therefore both your meate and drinke be in ſuch temper, that they be not cold but warme, leſt when as yee are hot within by your Bathing and ſweating, the cold ſtrike ſuddenly into ſome principall member and hurt it.</p>
               <p>They that are of a hote Complexion, and of an open nature, and not well faſtened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ought not to tarry ſo long in the bath, as other ought that are of colder and faſter complexions.</p>
               <p>If that any man betweene meale times be vexed with thirſt, he may not drinke any thing, ſaving for a great need he take a little Barley water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Water ſodden with the fourth part of the juyce either of ſowre or milde ſweet Pomgranats, with a little Suger: a man may uſe for a need, a little Vineger, with Water and Suger, if he have no diſeaſe in the Sinewes, nor in the Joynts.</p>
               <p>A man that is very weake, or accuſtomed
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:121645:121"/>
much to ſleepe after dinner, an houre and a halfe after that he is riſen from the Table, he may take a reaſonable ſleepe.</p>
               <p>All the time that a man is in them, he muſt keepe himſelfe chaſte from all women, and ſo he muſt doe a moneth after, after the counſell of divers learned Phyſitians, and ſome for the ſpace of forty dayes, as <hi>Pantheus</hi> and <hi>Alear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> would, namely, if they come out of the Cauldron.</p>
               <p>It were meete that in every foure and twenty houres the Bath ſhould be letten out, and freſh water received into the pit againe, for ſo ſhall you ſooner be healed, and better abide with leſſe jeopardy, abiding in the Bath.</p>
               <p>It is moſt meete for them that have any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe in the head, as a Catliaire or Rheume, comming of a moyſt cauſe and not very hot. For them that have Palſies, or ſuch like diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that they cauſe a bucket to be holden over their heads, with an hole in it, of the bigneſſe of a mans little finger, about foure foote above their heads, ſo that by the Reed or Pipe made for the nonce, the water may come downe with great might upon the mould of the Head, if they have the Cathaire; and upon the nape of the necke, if the Patient be ſicke of the Palſie, or any ſuch like diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:121645:121"/>
The clay or grounds of the Bath, is better for the Dropſie then is the water alone: It is alſo good for ſhrunken, ſwelled, and hard places, and for all old and diſeaſed places, which cannot well be healed with other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines: The matter is, to lay the grounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, and to hold the ſame againſt the hote Sunne, or a warme fire, untill it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hard, and then to waſh away the foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Clay, with the water of the Bath: this may a man doe as oft as he liſt. Some Phyſitians counſell, that betweene the Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, when a man is twice bathed upon one day, in the time that the Patient is out of the bath, to uſe his plaiſtering with the Clay: but if the perſon be any thing weake, J counſell not to goe twice into the Bath, but either once, or elſe to be content with the plaiſtering of the mudde or grounds of the Bath.</p>
               <p>It were good wiſedome for them that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tarry long at the Bathes, either for heate or for cold, to take home with them ſome of the grounds, and there occupie it as is afore-told.</p>
               <p>There are certaine learned men, which rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon that the hote breath or vapour that riſeth up from the Bathe, is much more mightier then the water of the bath is, and it is true: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were well that they which have any
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:121645:122"/>
Dropſie, and eſpecially a Tympanie, ſhould ſit over ſuch a place of the Bath, that they might receive into the moyſt diſeaſed place, the vapour of the bathe, either by an holed ſtoole, or by ſome other ſuch like manner of thing well deviſed for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If any poore man by the heate of the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Bathe cannot ſleepe enough, let him eate Lettice, or Purſlaine, or the ſeedes of Poppy, called Chesbowle, in ſome places of <hi>England,</hi> or let him eate Suger and Poppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed together, let this be done at night. Hee may alſo if he cannot get the aforeſaid things, ſeethe Violet leaves and Mallowes, and bathe the uttermoſt parts with that they are ſodden in. Theſe are remedies for poore folke that are not able to have a Phyſitian with them to give them counſell: Let the rich uſe ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies as their Phyſitians ſhall counſell them.</p>
               <p>If any poore man be vexed with any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable thirſt, let him take a little Barley and ſeethe it long, and put a little Suger unto it: or let him take the juyce of an Orange, or take a little of it with a little Suger.</p>
               <p>If any poore man catch the Head-ache, let him take a little Wormelade if he can get it, or Coriander Comfits: or if he can get none of theſe, let him take the white of an Egge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:121645:122"/>
beate it with Vineger, and Roſewater, or with the broath of Violets, or Nightſhade, or with any of them, and a little Vineger, and lay them in a cloath unto the temples of his head, and forehead.</p>
               <p>If any poore man be burned too much, let him take a Gliſter made with Mallowes, Beetes, and Violet leaves, or let him ſeethe Prunes with Barley a good while, and Raiſins, putting a way the ſtones, and eate of them, or let him uſe Suppoſitories ſometimes, made of rootes, either of Beetes, of Flower-de-Luce, or of white Sope, or of ſalt Bacon.</p>
               <p>If any man ſweat too much, let him uſe colder meates than he uſed before, with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger or Verjuyce, and let them alſo eate Sheepes-feete, and Calves-feete, with Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juyce or Vineger.</p>
               <p>If any man have the burning of his water when he maketh it, let him an houre after he is come out of the Bathe, annoynt his Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes with ſome cold Oyntment, as is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigidus Galeni:</hi> or if you cannot come by that, let him ſeethe Violet leaves, Poppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, Raiſins, Licorice and Mallowes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtraine them, and put ſome Suger in the broath, and drinke of it a draught before Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:121645:123"/>
If any be troubled with the Rheume which he hath caught in the Bath, let him parch or briſtle at the fire <hi>Nigella Romana,</hi> and hold it in a cloath to his Noſe, and let him ſet cups or boxing glaſſes to his ſhoulders, without any ſcorching, and let him drinke ſodden water with Barley, and with a little Suger.</p>
               <p>If any man have any appetite to eate, let him uſe the ſirrups of Ribles or Barberies, or the ſirrup of unripe Grapes, or uſe Verjuyce or Vineger to provoke appetite in due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and now and then if ye can get it, let him take a little Marmalade, or of the ſirrup of Mynts, or Worm-wood Raman. (Theſe have I written for poore folke.) Thoſe that are rich, by the advice of the Phyſitians, may have other Remedies enough againſt the fore-named ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, that chance in the time of their bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>If thou be rid of thy diſeaſe by thy bathing, offer unto Chriſt in thy pure members, ſuch offering of Thankeſgiving, as thou mayeſt ſpare and give him hearty thankes, both in word, minde and deed, and ſinne no more, but walke in all kindneſſe of life and honeſty, as farre as thou ſhalt be able to doe, as long as thou ſhalt live hereafter.</p>
