            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

adventured to put it forth, without my privity, I doubt a little unseasonably, but I am confident with a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: Therefore I must not be angry with them.</p>
            <p>For my self, I must desire thee, once for all, to take notice,
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>1.</hi> That I only relate some mens opinions Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and defend them from unjust aggravations; but am not concerned to maintain them to be true or accurately expressed.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>2.</hi> That I acknowledg there be some depths, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies relating to <hi>Predestination</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> which I am not able to fathom. Nor are these the only points in Divinity, in which I believe some things, against which I have objections that I cannot answer any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than by saying, that every Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must needs be true though seemingly contrary to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which my imperfect and corrupt reason apprehends to be true. It is commonly laid to the charge of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> that they make <hi>reason</hi> the <hi>Judg</hi> in Controversies of Faith, and so I verily think it is in some sense: but that it should be <hi>Judex normalis,</hi> the <hi>Norma</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> according to which we are to judge, so as we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing but what we could have demonstrated to be true or possible by meer reason, is an opinion so wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that I hope it is but falsly fathered on the <hi>Socinians.</hi> I believe the Hypostatical Vnion, a Trinity of persons in the Vnity of Essence: if a reason of this my Faith be asked, I will quote the Scriptures, which clearly assert those two Articles: having so done, I have resolved Faith into its first Principle, and I will continue sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast and immoveable in my Faith though I cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, either how three Persons subsist in one numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal nature, or how two natures can be united so as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

make but one person, In like manner, I will believe the Doctrine of Original Sin, as it is explained in our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion, because I find that explication of it agreeable to Scripture, though I cannot so clearly make it out to my own or another mans reason, how Original sin is propagated. I will also believe, <hi>that God hath mercy on whom he will and hardneth whom he will,</hi> bestoweth his determining Grace on whom he will and denieth it to whom he will, because this is a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Doctrine, though the reconciling of Gods eternal Decrees and the efficacy of Grace with the liberty of mans will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> surpass my knowledge. And I am the more confident, that I am not mistaken in thinking this to be a Scripture Doctrine, because, as I have shewen in the following Papers, it hath been so adjudged by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers of the Church. Nor is it a small confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to me, that the greatest opposers of <hi>Calvinism</hi> (as they are resolved to call it) have, after the highest straining of their wits and diligence, been able to say nothing against it, but what the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelagians</hi> had before objected against S. <hi>Austin</hi> and his Disciples. I know there be many who think quite otherwise: These will say, <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

abolishing set Forms of Worship, denying the old Catholick Doctrine of a Real Presence, and consequently all External Reverence in the participation of the blessed Sacrament: which</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>seriously laboured to preserve in the same estate in which he found them at the present.

And some think, that had not the raging of that Pestilential disease called <hi>Anglicus Sudor</hi> put an end to the Conference, the very difference in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to the Sacrament had been made an end of. But let us go on with the <hi>Doctor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Zuinglian <hi>Reformation, was begun in defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Images, decrying the established Fasts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Festivals, abolishing set Forms of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, denying the old Catholick Doctrine of a Real Presence, and consequently all External Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the participation of the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Historian</hi> saith, that <hi>the</hi> Zuinglian <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation began in defacing Images,</hi> the Reader will be apt to think, that defacing Images was the first fruit of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> his Reformation: But if he should so think, he would be mistaken. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> his Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation began in Preaching of the Word at <hi>Zurick:</hi> whither he came <hi>Anno 1519,</hi> leaving another place in which he had a larger stipend than he could there expect, (<hi>N. B.</hi> Both the <hi>Helvetian</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Reformer agreed in this, that neither cared for Gold or sought great Livings.) He laid the foundation also of Reformation in encouraging the study of the learned Languages, the neglect whereof brought in Popery. It was not till
<pb facs="tcp:40538:6"/>
               <hi>Zuinglius</hi> had been five or six years Preacher at <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> that Idols and Images were burnt in the Market place, and being then burnt by publick Authority, what was there in the fact that deserved not praise? Is it not commendable in Christian Magistrates, after they have heard it proved by their Divines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Images are not to be suffered in Churches or other places of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick resort, and when none either could or would say any thing for the retaining of them, to take them away, that so they may be no farther temptations to Idolatry? As much as this was appointed to be done in our <hi>English</hi> Reformation: why it is not done in the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches we shall by and by hear.</p>
            <p>It is added by the <hi>Historian,</hi> that the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation <hi>did begin in decrying the established Fasts and appointed Festivals.</hi> If the meaning of this be, that <hi>Zuinglius</hi> decryed the multitude of Fasts and Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, appointed to be observed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or that he condemned the necessity and meritoriousness, which the Papists ascribed to the observation of Fasts and Feasts, it is true, and tends to the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Zuinglius:</hi> but that he decryed <hi>every esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Fast, or appointed Festival,</hi> is a most noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious slander.</p>
            <p>So is it also, that his Reformation <hi>began in the abolishing of set Forms of Worship:</hi> unless the meaning be, that he procured the abolition of some forms of worship, set by the Papists as Papists. And if an Historian, after he hath told us, that a man abolished set forms of Worship may be allowed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret himself of <hi>Popish Idolatrous forms of Worship,</hi> then may we think, he hath no mind to be
<pb facs="tcp:40538:7"/>
understood, and, without any blame at all, neglect him.</p>
            <p>It follows: the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Reformation <hi>began in the denying of the old Catholick Doctrine of a Real Presence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This charge must be intended of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Real Presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e of Christ in the <hi>Sacrament of the Lords Supper</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if it be so intended, it is as false as what is most false. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> had been at <hi>Zurick</hi> five years, and reformed many things before he let any one know his mind about the Sacrament, and perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knew his own mind as to the manner of Christs presence in or with the Sacramental Elements. When he after long study discovered his mind about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he never denyed a <hi>Real Presence,</hi> unless by Real Presence be understood a <hi>Corporal Presence.</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum,</hi> by a Trope: so did our Reformers in <hi>England.</hi> He thought the Bread was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ody of Christ Representatively. And, as our King may be and is said to be really present, where there is any one who by his own Authority is appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him; so the Body of Christ may be said to be really present where there is an Element, appointed by himself to represent his Body. And if Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> did opine that the Body which our Lord Iesus united to his Divine Nature and with which he ascended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is any other way present in the Eucharist, he both erred and dissented from that Church in which he was bred up.</p>
            <p>For a conclusion, the <hi>Historian</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Reformation <hi>began in denying all Exte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reverence in the participation of the Blessed Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40538:7"/>Words more strange than any that we had before. For what is meant by <hi>the Blessed Sacrament?</hi> Sure the <hi>Dr.</hi> was so much a Christian, as to acknowledge at least two Blessed Sacraments. If so, which of these two would he have us to understand by the Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament? Baptism, or the Lords Supper? I know not why the later, should rather be called the <hi>Blessed Sacrament</hi> than the former; nor why more <hi>External Reverence</hi> is necessary in the participation of this than of that, supposing the Recipient to be adult. If a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Jew</hi> should come to be Baptised, why is he not as well bound to kneel when he is sprinkled with water, as when he takes the Bread and Wine? As for <hi>Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> he never denied External Reverence in the Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Blessed Sacrament of the Lords Supper. The mode and form in the which he first administred it, is recited in <hi>Melchior Adam,</hi> and in the <hi>Historia Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaria de Coena Domini,</hi> and in it all needful Reverence was used. But, perhaps, not to make the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants receive the Sacred Elements on their knees, is to deny all External Reverence in the participation of the Eucharist. If so, Christ and all his Churches for some Centuries must also be affirmed to have denied all External Reverence.</p>
            <p>By this it appears what false witness the <hi>Dr.</hi> hath born against <hi>Zuinglius.</hi> Doth he bear a truer witness concerning <hi>Luther?</hi> Of him these words are used, <hi>which</hi> Luther <hi>seriously laboured to preserve in the same estate in which he found them at the present.</hi> Words that either are senseless, or very untrue: If they have any sense, it must be this, that <hi>Luther</hi> seriously endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preserve the things before mentioned, in the same
<pb facs="tcp:40538:8"/>
estate in which he found them in the Papacy. This sense the words do scarse afford: But if we suppose that this sense was intended, I then say, Nothing more false could have been written, <hi>Luther</hi> did not seriously endeavour to preserve any one thing before-mentioned in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which he found it.</p>

            <p>But perhaps in the point of Predestination, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> were at deadly strife and variance.

<pb facs="tcp:40538:10"/>
grows more bold and confident (yet not so bold as to prove the proposition for which he was challenged,) and in these words he swaggers, <hi>I will yet add more Popery to the former, and so leave you my Friends and Informers to chew the cud on it, as they did after Lectures.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath ever been visible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is, and ever was, a true Church since it was a Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the true Church hath been Visible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any after Lectures do not chew the cud, <hi>i. e.</hi> meditate, they are unclean beasts; but wo be to those who must chew the cud on such food as this. The enunciation here concluded is, <hi>The true Church hath been Visible,</hi> which I never heard any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian deny. But let us see how this man of learning proveth it. The Premises are, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath ever been Visible,</hi> This Proposition is most false and contrary to all History; <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is, and ever was, a true Church since it was a Church,</hi> This premise is not apt to infer the conclusion: It should have been thus formed, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the true Church;</hi> but then it had been Popish with a vengeance. Little need have the Puritans to pray, <hi>a Montacutii Logica liberes nos Deus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed I have observed, that many of those who are no friends to the <hi>absolute decree,</hi> have hut little friendship for <hi>Syllogisms;</hi> they count themselves put into the Pillory or Stocks as often as they are constrained to argue in <hi>form.</hi> If they may not be allowed to rhetoricate, to amplifie and

               </gap>; then are they like Wasps without a sting, or like Soldiers disarmed. <hi>Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Andreas</hi> was earnestly desired by <hi>Beza</hi> that the Conference betwixt them might be managed <hi>syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistically</hi>; but <hi>Andreas</hi> was so far from yielding, that he swore in these or the like words, <hi>Per vitam meam nunquam sic vidi in scholis nostris disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri. Vid.</hi> Bez. <hi>in praef. ad acta Coll.</hi> I hope he wronged the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Schools, or else I must needs say, they had strange Schools, in which a man could never hear a Syllogistical Disputation. In our Schools no Disputations are allowed but what are Syllogistical, and the main work of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator</hi> is, to keep the Disputants to <hi>form.</hi> And this was that which <hi>Tertullian</hi> so much commended, <hi>ad lineas &amp; in gradum disputare:</hi> that which <hi>St. Hierom</hi> so often called for, in his Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against the Luciferians; <hi>Rhetoricaris, &amp; a disputationum spinctis, ad c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And yet the Author of <hi>Gods love to man-kind</hi> makes this one of his reasons why he suspected the Doctrine of absolute Reprobation not to be true, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the maintainers of it are so loth to have it examined.</hi> But the Author, before he died, knew, that the absolute decree did not fear tryal, but was as generally entertained, and as firmly held, after it had endured the most severe tryals, as before.

            <p>To conclude, If any one who is a Scholar and will write like a Scholar, will be at the pains to shew me, that <hi>Arminianism</hi> in the five points <hi>is not contrary to the Doctrine of St.</hi> Austin (the
<pb facs="tcp:40538:12"/>
hammer of Pelagianism,) <hi>nor yet contrary to the Doctrine of our Church,</hi> I shall either speedily reply or acknowledge my self his Prisoner. Put if any one shall publish a Book against me, stuffed only with impotent railings or malicious calumnies, I shall punish him, as I have done two or three already, by not buying, not reading his Book.</p>
            <p>It will perhaps be said, that <hi>the</hi> Papists, <hi>against whom we should unite our forces, will be too too much gratified by one</hi> Protestant<hi>'s writing against another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I doubt not, but the Factors for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, do with much delight tell their Disciples, how those that are not in Communion with them are divided among themselves: But they should do well to make up their own breaches before they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid us wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He, that being scandalised at the diversity of opinions among the <hi>Reformed,</hi> shall betake himself to the <hi>Romanists,</hi> will leap out of the frying-pan into the fire. The <hi>Papists</hi> only agree in that, in which they dare not publish how much they differ: and they then let a Popes decision put an end to their disputes, when they can neither say, that the Pope was misinformed, or that he was not in <hi>Cathed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a,</hi> or know not how by some distinction to evade the determination; that is, they then let the Popes reconcile them, when they have no mind to be any longer at variance. They will not deny, but that there is as much difference between their <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscans</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their <hi>Jansenists</hi> and <hi>Molinists,</hi> as there is betwixt <hi>Calvinists</hi> and <hi>Arminians:</hi> and yet
<pb facs="tcp:40538:12"/>
they say, that their Church is one, and not ours. How is this to be unridled? One <hi>A. D.</hi> about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, put forth a Pamphlet which he called <hi>a Treatise of Faith;</hi> near the later end of which he lets us understand, that <hi>the</hi> Roman <hi>Church is alwayes one and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in Faith, never varying or holding any dogmatical point contrary to that which in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times it did hold. The learned men thereof, though sometimes differing in opinion, in matters not defined by the Church, yet, in matters of Faith, all conspire in one. And no marvel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have a most convenient means to keep unity in profession of Faith; sith they do acknowledge one chief Pastor appointed over them</hi> (viz. <hi>the Successor of St.</hi> Peter,) <hi>to whose definitive censure, in matters concerning Religion, they wholly submit themselves.</hi> The Gentlemans meaning if I can fathom it is, that the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> are resolved to think their Church is at unity within it self. For though the members thereof have <hi>10000</hi> differences among themselves, yet those differences are not in matters of Faith, because they are resolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as soon as the Church shall decide them, never to differ more. Well, one would think that Protestants also might be at unity; because they profess they will yield to Scripture determination whatever it be. Nay, that the Gentleman will n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t grant; <hi>because,</hi> as he had told us a little before, <hi>divers men expound the Scriptures diversly.</hi> As if the decisions of their Church were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded diversly by divers, and were not as apt to be
<pb facs="tcp:40538:13"/>
diversly expounded as the Scriptures. And, as if they were as much at an end after they had found out the meaning of a decision made by the Pope, as we are when we have found out the meaning of the Scripture. Convince a <hi>Protestant,</hi> that any one place of Scripture must needs be so understood as to assert Consubstantiation, he becomes a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>siast</hi> forthwith: But when you have convinced a <hi>Papist,</hi> that a decision of the Pope must needs be so interpreted as to cross his opinion, yet he will not lay down his opinion; but will say, perhaps, that the Pope did decide not as Pope but only as a Learned man, or that it may be questioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a Pope, or whether he be infallible out of a Councel, or whether he was rightly informed of matter of fact? Suppose a <hi>Jansenist</hi> should thus argue, The Pope did not intend to condemn the Doctrine of <hi>Augustine</hi>: therefore, He did not intend to condemn the Doctrine of <hi>Jansenius.</hi> A <hi>Molinist</hi> would be loth to deny the <hi>Antecedent</hi>; and yet if he deny the <hi>Consequent,</hi> then hath the <hi>Jansenist</hi> field-room enough, and is as far from being proselyted as if nothing had been determined against <hi>Jansenism.</hi> In the mean time it were hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be wished, that <hi>Protestant Ministers</hi> would v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng themselves. The day is yet to come that ever I preached Sermon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Election or Reprobation, and I look upon it as a great affliction that I have been by the daring provocations of others put upon it to write about them. I could easily have born it that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:40538:13"/>
should trample upon my self; but could not so well endure it, that for my sake the honour of some of our best Reformed Writers should be laid in the dust. If <hi>Zuinglius, Calvin, Beza</hi> may still be read without prejudice and quoted in the Pulpit with due respect, If I can but perswade young Scholars that those who composed our Articles did understand them, and would not enjoyn men to recant such tenents as were agreeable to them; then have I obtained what I principally aimed at. And so, good <hi>Reader,</hi> I commend thee to the love of God, and to the hatred of Popery and Superstition and every opinion that hath a natural tendency thereunto.</p>

delivered to the Saints.</hi> Against these, as many as had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of mens precious and immortal souls, have in all Ages thought themselves obliged to contend earnestly, and that with two sorts of weapons: The first <hi>Apodictical,</hi> proving the truth, and refelling the errors opposite to it, by evidence of Scriptures, and strength of Reason; the second <hi>Historical,</hi> confirming Truth by the Testimonies and Authority of men renowned for Learning and Piety. The former are the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons <hi>mighty through God to the throwing down of strong holds,</hi> but the later have also been used with good success; and indeed he must be a perfect stranger to all modesty and humility, who doth hastily embrace any assertion opposed by all, or the greatest part of the <hi>Fathers, Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Reformers</hi> of the Church. With these later Weapons I intend (he assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>who worketh in us both to will and to do,</hi>) to encounter the Reverend Doctor <hi>Peter Heylin,</hi> thought, it seems by the many importunate Letters sent to him, as able as any to strengthen the weak hands of <hi>Arminius,</hi> and his followers.

                  </gap>, lead, as many as did embrace it, into the greatest impiety: 'Tis also farther added there by <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> that he had very perfect remembrance of <hi>Polycarpe,</hi> who conversed with S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and that he could witness, as in the presence of God, that had that blessed and Apostolical <hi>Presbyter</hi> (so he calls <hi>Polycarpe,</hi> not Bishop) heard any such thing as was by <hi>Florinus</hi> asserted, he would have stopped his ear; and cryed aloud, according to his custom, <gap reason="foreign">

&amp;c. <hi>Good God! unto what times hast thou kept me that I should hear such things?</hi> yea, that he would forthwith have fled out of that place, in which, either standing or sitting, he had heard any such impiety: Which considerations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly do not want their weight, at least they are as material as any brought by Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> himself. Upon this occasion it may not be amiss to mention the Arguments by which, if not <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> yet other of the Antient Fathers have opposed this (not undeservedly called) <hi>Doctrine of Devils,</hi> that <hi>God is the Author of sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. They laid some stress upon this, that <hi>sin</hi> is not <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> but <hi>privative.</hi> This Argument is largely prosecuted by <hi>Dionysius,</hi> commonly (though falsly) call'd the <hi>Areopagite</hi>: He proveth that Moral evil cannot be from God, because it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Answer. About,</hi> is a word that will stretch, and hath saved many a lie, yet was it no more than was needful; For so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain is our Historian about the time of these wretched miscreants rising, that having in these words placed it at the year 1529, a very few Lines after, he placeth it at <hi>An.</hi> 1527, but his Friend <hi>Prateolus</hi> placeth it lower yet, at the year 1525: at which time Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> was not much above sixteen years old; being born, if he who writes his Life deceive me
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40538:19"/>
not, the sixth of <hi>Iune, Anno</hi> 1509: and therefore it would be a most strange oversight in <hi>Prateolus,</hi> if he should af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the Libertines were the Progeny of <hi>Calvin.</hi> But the truth is, <hi>Prateolus</hi> is guilty of no such oversight, though the Doctor is pleased to charge it upon him: There is no necessity in the World, that <hi>e Schola nostrae tempestatis E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicorum,</hi> (which are <hi>Prateolus</hi> his words,) should take in <hi>Calvin. Bellarmine</hi> doth indeed, in the place quoted by the Doctor, say, <hi>Omnino probabile est, ut Anabaptistae ex Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theranis, sic Libertinos ex Calvinianis promanasse</hi>: But he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a reason, which methinks no one of his admirers should be able to read without blushing. <hi>For in the books of</hi> Calvin <hi>and his Master</hi> Zuinglius <hi>and his Disciple</hi> Beza, <hi>as also of</hi> Martin Bucer <hi>and</hi> Peter Martyr, <hi>are found most apert sentences out of which it is collected that God is the Author of all the wickednesses which are perpetrated by men.</hi> Let us form this reason into an <hi>Euthymem</hi> that the goodliness of it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. <hi>There are in</hi> Zuinglius, Calvin, Beza, Bucer, Martyr, <hi>most apert sentences from which it is gathered that God is the Author of sin: Therefore it is altogether probable that the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines did arise from the Calvinians.</hi> The <hi>Antecedent</hi> he indeed useth all his wit and malice, for many Chapters, to prove; howbeit with most pitiful success, as divers have shewn, divers are still ready to shew. But why did he not use some covering for the <hi>Consequent,</hi> the nakedness whereof is so visible? Could he think that we without more ado would believe the <hi>Libertines</hi> were the brood of the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> if the <hi>Calvinians</hi> have sentences in their writings from whence it may be inferred that God is the Author of sin. Perhaps the <hi>Libertines</hi> were risen in the world before these mens writings were extant. Perhaps they never saw these mens writings, though they were extant, when they did arise. Perhaps there were other men, no <hi>Calvinians,</hi> whose writings the <hi>Libertines</hi> were acquainted with, and sucked their loose opinions from. Why do I use the word perhaps? Most certain it is, that no writing of any <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> either did or could bring Libertinism into the world. But it is as certain that if the first Libertines were bookish men (as I think they were not,) there were extant many Popish Divines and Professors Books, in which were sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences more likely to draw men into Libertinism than any
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40538:20"/>
extant in <hi>Calvin,</hi> or any of his Disciples, or Collegues. Nay, if need were I could shew, even in <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, such sentences as have a greater shew of making God the Author of sin, than any used by <hi>Calvin.</hi> But if the Cardinal had a mind to lay those ugly brats of Libertinism and Anabaptism at the Protestants doors, Why did he trouble himself to father them on two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering sorts of Protestants? Why doth he say, that Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists are the progeny of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and Libertines the brood of the <hi>Calvinians?</hi> Doth he not confess that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> did at first teach the very same things, ministring to Libertinism, that the <hi>Calvinians</hi> teach? If so, Why might not the Libertines learn their lessons from them? Were not the first Anabaptists Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines as well as Anabaptists? If they were not, they are much abused by Historians; And if they were, sure ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Anabaptism is falsly fathered on the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or else Libertinism also must call them fathers. But why should we seek any other fathers of Anabaptism than the Papists? Nothing made the Anabaptists so infamous as their pretended euthusiasms or revelations, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising of dignities, and rebelling against Magistrates: And who laid the foundation of enthusiasm, I shewed a young Scholar above twenty years ago, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be levened with that fanaticism, and he will thank me for it, I doubt not, all the days of his life. What Schools first taught rebellion against Princes, Bishop <hi>Morton</hi> and twenty more have shewn. As for Rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of persons Baptized in infancy (whence Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists have their name,) it is the most innocent er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of all the Anabaptists hold; and yet even this oweth its rise and progress, to Popish principles and practices: as the Papists shall be made to know if they desire it. Nor hath it been my hap, as yet, to hear of any opinion so wild and absurd of our late Sectaries, that I could not derive from some famous Schoolman. Well, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor himself is not unwilling to acquit <hi>Calvin</hi> from being the Parent of these <hi>Libertines,</hi> and acknowledgeth, that Calvin <hi>was not wanting to purge himself from such an odious imputation</hi>: And I hope he hath sufficiently purged himself, if a Learned and full Confutation of their opinion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40538:20"/>
be a sufficient Purgation. The truth is, <hi>Coppin</hi> and <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> as also <hi>Bertrand</hi> and <hi>Perseval,</hi> were all Papists. As for <hi>Antonius Pocquius</hi> (whom Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> according to his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking faculty calls, page 3. <hi>Franciscus Porquius</hi>) he was undoubtedly a Romanist, and a Romanist in Orders, a <hi>Franciscan</hi> Fryer. It cannot be denied (nor is it,) that <hi>Pocquius</hi> was for some time at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and being to leave that place, he would fain have obtained Letters Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and Commendatory from <hi>Calvin,</hi> as he had from <hi>Martin Bucer</hi>; but Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> though he then knew not the spirit of the man perfectly, did so shrewdly suspect him to be a Fanatick, that he would never be prevailed with to testifie any good thing on his behalf: Yea when this Deceiver discovered himself, he could not forbear him, but chastised him and <hi>Quintin,</hi> sharply and by name, in his discourse against the <hi>Libertines</hi>: And when the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> (who though not tainted with the <hi>Libertines</hi> Errors, was bewitched with the pretended Holiness of these two chief Sticklers) took her self to be wounded through their sides, this man of God wrote to her with admirable moderation, (so it was meet, considering her dignity, and the good that she had done to the Church of God,) but withal, he reprehended her imprudence for admitting such men, and by this Letter he so far prevailed, that this abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Sect which began to flock apace into <hi>France,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards kept it self in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Countries adjacent: the Epistle is to be seen among <hi>Calvins</hi> Epistles, pag. 53. To conclude, I do throughly joyn with the Doctor, in dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting all those, who either directly, or by any just conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence known to them, make the Holy God the Author or cause, of all or any sinfulness. Nor do I know any <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> that will not without the least hesitation joyn with us both in this detestation. If there be any that will not, let him be cursed with the severest Anathema's: If he should publish any thing of this nature, let his Book be a Victime to <hi>Vulcan</hi>; as Master <hi>Archers</hi> was by the appointment of the two Houses, and at the desire of the late Assembly of Divines. A story of which transaction it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss here to insert, from Doctor <hi>Arrowsmiths</hi> Chain of Principles;
<q>In the year 1645. there was published in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> an English Book, wherein God was expresly made
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40538:21"/>
the Author of his peoples sins, though not without some li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations. The Assembly of Divines, then sitting at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> took offence at this, made complaint of it to both Houses of Parliament: they both censured the said book to be burnt, by the hand of the Common Hangman: and the Assembly of Divines agreed upon a Declaration, <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine contradicente,</hi> by way of detestation of that abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and blasphemous opinion; which was also published under that Title <hi>Iuly</hi> 17. 1945, and in which we meet with these expressions among others, that The most vile and blasphemous assertion, whereby God is avowed to be the Author of sin, hath hitherto, by the general consent of Christian Teachers and Writers, both Antient and Modern, and those as well Papists as Protestants, been not disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only, but even detested and abhorred: Our common adversaries, the Papists have hitherto, only calumniously charged the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches, with so odious a crime, (in the mean time confessing that we do in words deny it, as well as they themselves;) Now should this Book be tolerated, they might insult over us, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish to the world, that in the Church of <hi>England</hi> it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and impudently maintained, that God is the Author of sin, than which there is not any one point, whereby they labour in their Sermons and popular Orations, to cast a greater <hi>Odium,</hi> (though most injuriously) upon the Reformed Churches: We are not for the reverence or estimation of any mans person, to entertain any such opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as do, in the very words of them, asperse the honour and holiness of God, and are by all the Churches of Christ rejected.</q>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. What <hi>Christian</hi> besides Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> would have taken upon him thus <hi>to judge before the Day of Iudgment?</hi> Had it not been censure high and hard enough, to say of so eminent a Reformer, that he did write his Book <hi>partly out of opposition to</hi> Erasmus, but it must be also affirmed, that he did it <hi>out of meer opposition to</hi> Erasmus?</p>
               <p n="2">2. What <hi>Scholar</hi> besides Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> would have quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Luther, de servo arbitrio,</hi> and never refer so much as in his Margin to <hi>any page,</hi> where we may find the things that are quoted out of him, and examine their coherence with passages antecedent and consequent?</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the thing it self, <hi>Servum arbitrium,</hi> is no false Divinity, <hi>Voluntas humana non est libera, antequam liberetur</hi>; In the first conversion a man is <hi>passive,</hi> as <hi>passive as a stone is in receiving the impression or signature that is made on it</hi>; The liberty of the will discovers it self in its actings, not in its passions or receivings. I hope the Doctor holds that the Image of God in which the first man was Created, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the faculties of the soul. If he do not, then must
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40538:23"/>
he hold, that when man lost the Image of God, he also lost the faculties of his soul, which is contrary to reason and experience. If he do hold it distinct, I would feign know, whether the Will were not passive in receiving that Image? whether it did in the least cooperate towards the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it? If it did not, as certainly it did not; Why may not this Image be again restored, the Will not cooperating to the first restitution, and yet its liberty not be dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed? Is it any absurdity to say that a man is dead, <hi>i. e.</hi> void of spiritual life, before he is quickened? Or that a man is senseless till he have his spiritual senses given him? Yet do not I think that <hi>Luther</hi> was ever in such a height or heat of passion, as to say, that Gods working on the soul is in all things like to our working on a stone. <hi>Similitudes do not run on all four,</hi> as the Proverb is. When I draw a stone, no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal change is wrought on the stone, I destroy not those qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that unfit it for motion, nor do I put into it any qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that may fit it for motion; but when God doth <hi>out of stones raise up Children unto</hi> Abraham, he makes them cease to be stones, <hi>he taketh away the heart of stone,</hi> and <hi>gives an heart of flesh,</hi> he makes them a <hi>willing people,</hi> puts into them <hi>a new Nature, and a new motive faculty,</hi> and so they run unto and follow after Christ, as readily and cheerfully as the child follows the Parent from whom he expects good things. Well but <hi>Luther</hi> is beholding to the Doctor, for though he have given him this shrewd knock, yet at last he gives him a stroke, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had done before, intimating his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation of his rigorous opinion, <hi>Page</hi> 6.

Stars; For if God</hi> before all Eternity <hi>(as they plainly say,) did purpose and decree the fall of</hi> Adam, (Ut suâ defectione periret <hi>Adam,</hi> Calv. Inst. lib. 3. cap. 23. sect. 7.) <hi>there was in</hi> Adam <hi>a necessity of committing sin, because the Lord had so decreed it. If without consideration of the sin of man, he hath by his determinate sentence ordained so many millions of men to everlasting damnation, and that too</hi> necessariò &amp; inevitabiliter, <hi>as they please to phrase it, he must needs preordain them to sin also; there being (as themselves confess) no way unto the end but by the means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This is an heavy charge, and had need be well and clearly proved, or else the Doctor will be thought to have little of that, which is the <hi>bond of perfection, Charity:</hi> Let us examine his proof. The conclusion he is to infer is this, that <hi>Calvin doth ascribe all mens wicked actions to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable Decrees of Almighty God.</hi> What are his premises? He is no <hi>Syllogistical</hi> man, and therefore I will not tie him to the strict rules of argumentation; but examine what he saith as I find it. <hi>If God before all eternity (as they plainly say) did purpose and decree the fall of</hi> Adam, <hi>there was in</hi> Adam <hi>a necessity of sinning, because the Lord had so decreed it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Who are these <hi>they?</hi> Before there was no mention of any one save <hi>Calvin</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is he now multiplied into these two, <hi>Iohn, Calvin,</hi> as once <hi>Luther</hi> was into <hi>Martin,</hi> and <hi>Luther?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. How do these <hi>Iohn, Calvin</hi> say plainly, that <hi>God did before all eternity decree?</hi> Had it been said, that he decreed before all time, or from all eternity, this had been a plain speech; but how any decree should be made <hi>before all eternity,</hi> which hath no beginning, that is not plain: A man had need have Dr. <hi>Heylins</hi> wit to understand it.</p>
               <p>To the thing; <hi>God did purpose and decree the fall of our Father</hi> Adam <hi>from all eternity:</hi> What is the fault in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position? Is this it, that the Decree is said to be made from all eternity? Why surely there are no temporary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. Is it that the decree of God passed upon the fall of <hi>Adam?</hi> Certainly the decrees of the Almighty do reach every thing that hath happened, or that shall happen, be it good or evil: the very delivering of Christ into the hands of them that Crucified him is said to be, <hi>by the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate counsel and foreknowledge of God, Act.</hi> 2.23. Well,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40538:24"/>
but hence it will follow, <hi>that there was in</hi> Adam <hi>a necessity of committing sin.</hi> Verily a necessity in <hi>Adam</hi> is a phrase somewhat odd and uncouth. If the meaning of it should prove to be no more than this, that it was necessary <hi>Adam</hi> should fall or commit sin, I must grant this would follow, but see no imaginable absurdity in it. Imagine God had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver decreed to permit the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> Suppose him only to have foreseen it; hence will follow, that it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Adam</hi> should fall: But this is <hi>necessitas infallibilitatis,</hi> or <hi>consequentis,</hi> not <hi>necessitas coactionis,</hi> or <hi>consequentiae.</hi> Let the Doctor prove that any other necessity follows upon the decree; let him prove that we Calvinists do fabricate any decree, necessitating and compelling <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, whether he would or no, and I will yield him the whole cause. But he hath farther to say; <hi>If without consideration of the sin of man, he</hi> (God) <hi>hath by his determinate sentence ordained so many millions of men to everlasting damnation, and that too</hi> necessariò &amp; inevitabiliter, <hi>as they please to phrase it, he must needs preordain them to sin; there being no way to the end, but by the means.</hi>

<q>If any shall go about to set mans will at liberty, and to tie up short the decreeing and determining Will of God, as if this had not the determining stroke amongst all possible evil actions or events, which shall infallibly be and which shall infallibly not be, he may avoid the suspicion of <hi>Stoicism</hi> or <hi>Manicheism,</hi> but he will hardly avoid the suspicion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism</hi>; for the greater number of mens actions being wicked and evil, if these come into act, without Gods determinate counsel and decree, humane affairs are more over-ruled by mans will than by Gods.

The defenders of conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Predestination, may suppose they clear themselves well in the later, but we are sure they stick in the Semi-pelagian Bryars as concerning the former. For if God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fore-sight of mens faith and perseverance be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to predestinate them, Gods Predestination is no cause at all of Faith, or perseverance, or any saving grace; this prevision not causing things, but supposing them already produced by other causes.</q>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It must be acknowledged, that great care was used by the Church of God, to pluck up the tares that were sowed by <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and by (his Scholars shall I say or Masters) <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestius</hi> and <hi>Iulianus.</hi> The Learned and Holy Fathers em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their Pens against them, Councels made use of their authority against them, nor was the Secular power want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make very severe Edicts against them. But why doth the Doctor say that the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heresies were retracted by <hi>Pelagius</hi> himself in the Synod of <hi>Palestine</hi>? Retractation is when a man out of conviction of judgement revokes his errour: That <hi>Pelagius</hi> did in that Councel of <hi>Palestine</hi> do so, appears not.

To this end I must be more careful in setting down the History of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> than the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor hath been. I must also touch upon the story of

                  <hi>Pelagius</hi> is by the Learned <hi>Vossius</hi> more than once affirmed to be by birth a <hi>Scotchman.</hi> Being such a Pestilent enemy to the grace of God (unto which we owe all that we have, and all that we are) it might be excusable, if we should let this errour go undetected: but because truth is to be preferred to the honour of our Nation, we will rectifie that mistake, and acknowledge that he was our own Countryman: called (as is conceived) <hi>Pelagius,</hi> because born near the Sea-side. Some <hi>Cantabrigians</hi> would have him a Student in their Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, and so ungrateful to it, as to cause the overthrow and ruine of it, because it afforded Orthodox Divines that opposed his Doctrines. But upon the best search, it cannot be found that <hi>Pelagius</hi> in person did ever vent his poison in this Nation. They are in the right, who assign the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastry of <hi>Banchor</hi> for the place of his education. As to his natural and acquired parts, it is not unknown how sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Orosius</hi> speaks of them in his <hi>Apologet:</hi> as if he had been a man <hi>Cui neque natales dederunt ut honestioribus studiis erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur, neque naturaliter proveniebat ut saperet.</hi> But though <hi>Orosius</hi> be, not undeservedly, by Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> called <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissimus rerum Christianarum Historicus,</hi> yet is he not in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous; it being impossible that he should not have seen that Epistle of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> which sheweth him sufficiently a Scholar: Had he not been so, the Fathers, and the Church of God, would never have so troubled themselves about him. His conversation is by some commended; by others, who had as much reason to be acquainted with it, as much decryed: <hi>Vir egregie Christianus, vir Sanctus, &amp; non parvo profectu Christianus,</hi> are Elogiums bestowed on him by <hi>Austin,</hi> a man who seems to be raised up on purpose to confute him, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de pec. merit. &amp; remis. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3; It appears also by <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> in his fourth <hi>Epis. ad Olympiad.</hi> that he was reckoned among the men that did live very temperately and fare hardly, insomuch that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

being at that time in <hi>exile,</hi> Death approaching, did grieve exceedingly, when he heard of his erring from the Faith: But yet I find <hi>Pelusiota</hi> (a Scholar of this very <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> so Holy, that he was called by a peculiar name <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               <p>How are these things to be reconciled? Perhaps thus, <hi>Pelagius</hi> before he swerved from the Faith, did lead a strict life, and had a glorious form of Godliness; but when he fell into his horrid opinions derogatory to the grace of God, then was he a slave to his lusts: and just it was with God, to let him see how impossible it was to lead so much as a sober life without that grace, which he would not acknowledge necessary, no not to the highest acts of piety. Indeed <hi>Iansenius</hi> hath made this general observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>all the</hi> Pelagians <hi>were somewhat loose in their lives:</hi> Which observation, as he takes abundance of good pains to prove, so can it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I conceive, be too much considered in this Controversie; because the <hi>Pelagians</hi> do urge nothing more vehemently than this, that the <hi>extolling of the Grace of God,</hi> and lessening of the liberty of mans will, is the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way to destroy all piety; as shall be seen more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Mean while, we must take notice of a more modest and refined sort of <hi>Pelagians,</hi> commonly called <hi>Semipelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and from the place where they did most abound, <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silienses.</hi> Our <hi>England</hi> might accidentally occasion the rise of these men. <hi>Agricola</hi> an <hi>Emissarie</hi> of <hi>Pelagius</hi> had infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Church with <hi>Pelagianism</hi>; which it was no difficult thing to do, considering the dreadful ignorance, and lasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

               <p>It can scarse be doubted, but that we, who have the very same things objected against us that were objected against S. <hi>Austin,</hi> are of the same mind that <hi>Austin</hi> was; but because I am resolved to give not only <hi>full measure,</hi> but also <hi>running over,</hi> I shall make a parallel betwixt the <hi>Pelagian</hi> and <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelagian</hi> Heresie, and the opinions of <hi>Arminius</hi> and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant crew.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pelagius</hi> (in this not followed by the <hi>Semipelagians</hi>) did deny original sin. That in this he and <hi>Arminians</hi> do not differ needs not much proof; One of our own, highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the men of his own party, in a Book called <hi>Unum Necessar.</hi> doth in most express terms deny original sin, and take a great deal of unhappy pains to answer or rather elude, all the arguments drawn either from Scripture or experience for the proof of it. But perhaps <hi>Arminius,</hi> and his more <hi>ancient Disciples</hi> were modester? I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, this Writer hath exceeded and gone beyond <hi>Arminius,</hi> and all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Remonstrants; but yet <hi>Corvinus</hi> hath told us, <hi>Cont. Til. pag.</hi> 388. <hi>That, with</hi> Arminius, <hi>original sin hath not the nature of sin or fault, properly so called.</hi> I would feign have passed this as a Criticism, and charitably have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that he had only meant that original sin was not a sin or fault, in such a sense as actual sin is, but that I find <hi>Arminius</hi> himself, <hi>Answer to the ninth Question,</hi> pag. 174, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that <hi>it is wrongfully said, that original sin maketh a man guilty of death.</hi> Had he said that none are actually damned for original sin, it had been more tolerable, but to say that it doth not make guilty, or obnoxious unto death, is to make it no sin at all; and yet thus do the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants also speak in <hi>Apol. Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>Peccatum originis nec

The <hi>Pelagians</hi> also were wont much to insist on this, that Nothing could be both <hi>a sin</hi> and a <hi>punishment of sin</hi>; because <hi>sin</hi> is <hi>voluntary, punishment involuntary,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Austin</hi> to convince them, used to produce that place, which indeed carrieth great evidence in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. Against this, <hi>Iulianus</hi> would say, those speeches were Hyperbolical; but yet the Father so pressed him, that sometimes he could not but acknowledge that something might be, <hi>&amp; peccatum, &amp; paena peccati</hi>; whence that,

Doth not <hi>Arminius Pelagianize</hi> in this? See but the one and thirtieth Article objected to him; It will thence appear, that he took exception against the publick Catechism, because in it is said, that
<q>Original sin is a punishment; for if God did punish <hi>Adams</hi> sin with this, then he must punish this with another, and that other with another, and so there will be a <hi>processus in infinitum.</hi>

<q>They hold that God, before the Foundations of the World were laid, did foresee who would believe, and who would persevere in that Faith, (to this perseverance in

If their judgement was asked about infants dying in their infancy, they would reply, that they were predestinated to life or death according to the good or bad life which God foresaw they would have lead, if they had come to maturity of years.</p>
               <p>Do the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who are so angry when called <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> differ from them in this? I confess <hi>Arminius</hi> doth not make a man to be predestinated from <hi>foreseen Works,</hi> but from <hi>foreseen Faith</hi>; nor doth he make Faith the <hi>cause,</hi> but a <hi>condition,</hi> or <hi>decent antecedent,</hi> using a less suspected term, but intending the very same thing; for as our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Davenant</hi> hath well observed,

                  <hi>Arminius</hi> when he makes Faith a condition of Divine Election, infidelity a condition of reprobation, takes the word condition in the later sense, and so plainly makes it the same with a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious or motive cause; for he every where maintains that, <hi>posita side ponitur electio, negata fide negatur electio</hi>; that Faith is a means ordained and appointed by God for the obtaining of Election: therefore as that Learned Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor well concludes, <hi>pag.</hi> 119, 120. <hi>Sunt merae verborum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigiae cum aiunt, praevisam fidem &amp; infidelitatem esse conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones, non modo quae praecedunt praedestinationem &amp; reprobatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem communiter &amp; promiscue consideratam, sed etiam ex qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus oritur distinctio electorum, &amp; tamen negant habere aliquam causalitatem.</hi>

               <p>I had thought to have proceeded to the point of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance, but that I considered the necessary dependance of that on the other two, concerning Election and Grace. By what hath already been laid down, it is manifest, that if the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians</hi> were in the right, then are not the <hi>Arminians</hi> mistaken; but if <hi>Austin, Prosper, Hilary,</hi> and those others whom the Church of God hath been wont to grace with the Title of <hi>Orthodox,</hi> were not in an errour, then Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> and those that follow him are in the right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Here I may expect it will be said, that the Doctrine most quarrelled at in the <hi>Calvinists,</hi> is the <hi>Doctrine of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute reprobation,</hi> and in favour of that, nothing hath yet been produced out of Orthodox antiquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To that I shall answer,
<list>
                     <item>1. By concession that if by reprobation absolute, be meant <hi>a purpose to damn any man without consideration of, or respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sin, either actual or original</hi>; such an absolute reprobation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40538:33"/>
is indeed unknown to all antiquity: but as yet I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meet with that <hi>Calvinist</hi> that asserted such an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute reprobation.</item>
                     <item>2. But if by reprobation absolute be meant, <hi>Gods purpose to deny Grace to some</hi> according to the pleasure of his will; I then stick not to affirm, that such reprobation absolute is not unknown to antiquity. Indeed the Ancients do rarely speak of reprobation; our Church in her Articles mentions it not at all; both they &amp; she leave us to gather the nature of reprobation, which is but <hi>Non-Election</hi> or <hi>Praeterition,</hi> from what we find laid down concerning <hi>Election.</hi> Now seeing the Fathers, those of them that had to with the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> did constantly affirm, <hi>that Gods own good will, not any foresight of the good use of free-will, was it which moved God to give converting grace unto some</hi>; they must also hold that God did out of his own good pleasure, and not from any fore-sight of an ill use of free-will, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to deny this efficacious converting grace unto others. Indeed it's scarce rational to assert, that God should pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose not to cure any one, because he is sick; not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten any one, because he was by him looked on as dark and blind. But concerning the Judgement of Antiquity in this matter, no more shall be said at present; the Reader that desires further satisfaction, is referred to the Learned <hi>Davenant,</hi> in the close of his most accurate Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertation, concerning Election and Reprobation. As for <hi>Vossius</hi> his judgement concerning reprobation, it is consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Manuscript by Doctor <hi>Twisse,</hi> which Manuscript may possibly in a short time be published. From it, the World will soon see, how unjustly the absolute Decree is charged with Novelty.</item>

be guilty of, as if he had held and maintained <hi>that good men were inevitably pre-ordained to a life of happiness, wicked men inevitably pre-ordained to a life of endless misery, and that it profiteth not the wicked if they be converted, nor hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Godly if they sin.</hi> In this Synod <hi>Trithemius</hi> tells us, that he recalled and revoked his errour; but if he had so done, then would not both <hi>Rabanus</hi> and <hi>Hincmarus</hi> charge him, which yet full oft they do, with obstinacy. However at this Synod, <hi>Godescalk</hi> was banished <hi>Germany,</hi> and made to promise not to return, and sent to his own Bishop, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>Rhemes</hi>; for unto his Jurisdiction did the Monastery of <hi>Orbez</hi> (out of which <hi>Godescalk</hi> came) belong: The Epistle of <hi>Rabanus</hi> to <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi> signifying this, is to be seen in <hi>Historia Godes. pag.</hi> 46. One would think at this Synod <hi>Godescalk</hi> met with hard measure, but harder was measured out to him in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod held in the Palace of <hi>Carisacum:</hi> for being heard a second time, it is decreed that he should be divested of his <hi>Sacerdotal Office,</hi> if <hi>ever he were truly a Priest,</hi> (which those Fathers seem not willing to acknowledge, because forsooth he was ordained by <hi>Rigbold, Suffragan</hi> of <hi>Rhemes,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Sueston</hi> not consulted:) <hi>yea, that he should be whipped notwithstanding his Age, and confined for ever to his Cell.</hi> But what was all this while become of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustinian</hi> spirit?

               <p n="1">1.

resolved to make such determinations, not as were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the truth, but as were consistent with the pomp and glory of the <hi>Roman</hi> See. To evince this, I had thought to present my Reader with a short History of this Councel, gathered out of <hi>Padre Paul</hi> the <hi>Servite,</hi> and <hi>Sleidan,</hi> but the Reverend and Learned Doctor <hi>Iohn Cosins</hi> hath happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saved me this labour, and done the work to my hand; His Collection I shall transcribe:</p>
               <p>The calling of a Councel had been shifted off by <hi>Leo</hi> the X, <hi>Adrian</hi> the VI, <hi>Clement</hi> the VII; but <hi>Paul</hi> the III, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for nothing more than dissimulation, condescended so far, that a Synod should be summoned at <hi>Mantua</hi> in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and sent his Bull of Indiction <hi>May</hi> 27, <hi>Anno</hi> 1531: but his design not taking for that place, he sent out another Bull for a Councel to be held <hi>May</hi> the first 1538, at <hi>Vicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> a City under the Dominion of the <hi>Venetians:</hi> this Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction meeting also with opposition, he sends forth a third Bull, which commanded all Bishops and Abbots with other priviledged persons, provided they had taken an Oath to be obedient to the Pope's See of <hi>Rome,</hi> to repair to <hi>Trent,</hi> on the Confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> there to attend the Legates for the celebration of a Councel, to be begun <hi>November</hi> the first, <hi>Anno</hi> 1542. Against this Councel, protestations were made by the Princes and all the Reformed Churches in <hi>Germany,</hi> as also by the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> and many other places besides, which brought it to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Wherefore he se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> forth another Bull, and sent his Legates to <hi>Trent,</hi> to begin a Councel there, <hi>March</hi> 15, <hi>Anno</hi> 1545. The Legates being come to <hi>Trent,</hi> found no Prelate there but the Bishop of the place: Within a few days came three <hi>Italian</hi> Bishops, who, being dependants upon the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Men very ready to promote the Popes service, had order from him to be there with the first; for his desire was that the Councel should begin with as few as might be, and that to regulate the rest that came after. In order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he sent his Brief, and gave his Legates a Faculty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng to be put to the question and defined, which had not been
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40538:36"/>
formerly sent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and assented to by him; and with power, if need were to do him service in it, either to break up the Councel for altogether, or to suspend and prorogue it from time to time, or to remove and translate it from one place to another, at their pleasure; which was a device whereby all attempts and motions that might be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the enormities of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, should be sure to be defeated. For above all other things this was the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal matter, which was given them in charge, that they should not in any case suffer the Authority and Power of the Pope to be questioned. There was a proviso in the first words of the Bull, that they should do nothing without the consent of the Councel, but afterwards that clause was thought needful to be altered, and the Legats had an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power given them, independent of any but the Pope himself, whose service they only attended.</p>
               <p>Two Months passed after their coming to <hi>Trent</hi> before they got twenty Prelates into their company, and because they were somewhat ashamed to begin their <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Councel (as they are not ashamed to call it) with so small a number, they perswaded the Pope to put it off for eight months longer; though much a do they had to perswade the Prelates to stay all that while with them. But by the Months of <hi>December</hi> and <hi>Ianuary</hi> following (having in the mean while contented the poorer sort of Bishops with a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of fourty Ducats a piece, procured for them out of the Popes coffers,) they grew to somewhat a greater number. For, besides the Legates and the Cardinal Bishop of <hi>Trent,</hi> there were present four Archbishops; eight and twenty Bishops, three Abbots, and four Generals. And these three and fourty persons made the general Councel: Among whom two of the Archbishops were only Titular, being the Popes Pensioners at <hi>Rome,</hi> and now sent to <hi>Trent</hi> to increase the number, and to depend upon the Legats; but in those Churches whereof they bare the names, had they nothing to do, nor were they any lawful and true Bishops at all. The one of these was <hi>Olaus Magnus</hi> the <hi>Goth,</hi> who went for the Archbishop of <hi>Upsale</hi> in <hi>Swedland,</hi> and the other blind Sir <hi>Robert</hi> the <hi>Scot,</hi> who appeared for the Primat of <hi>Armagh</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and of whom it was then commonly said, that as pore-blind as he was, yet had he the commendation to ride
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40538:36"/>
Post the best in the World. And with these men they began their <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Chapter at <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far the Learned Doctor, whose design was only to take notice of an <hi>Anathema,</hi> passed in the fourth Session of this Conventicle, by which all were cursed that did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the new Canon of Scripture, in such manner and form as was there first appointed; but that design lead him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to observe, that in this <hi>Trent</hi> Assembly, there were private Congregations, which were appointed to be kept twice a week at one of the Legats Houses, for the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, debating, and framing of all their Decrees, before they were brought to be voted and defined abroad in any publick Session; for by this means the Legats would be sure, either to have every thing prepared to their own mind, and be able to number the Voices before hand, which way they would be given, or else not to suffer the matter to be brought to any open definition in their Councel at all. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the foresaid Learned Doctor having given us the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree concerning the new Canon, saith that it was passed but by a few; for of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church they had not one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it were some such as blind Sir <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> was: of the <hi>English</hi> as few, (for the Bishop of <hi>Worcester, Richard Pates</hi> was not yet come among them, and when afterwards he came thither, he was there but in a private and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal capacity, having no employment given him by the Church of <hi>England</hi>;) of the <hi>Helvetian, German,</hi> and <hi>Northern</hi> Churches none; of the <hi>French</hi> Church scarce two; of the <hi>Spanish</hi> not many; all the rest were <hi>Italians,</hi> among whom divers were the Popes Pensioners, and sent thither to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance other mens voices, some of them Titular, and some Unlearned.</p>
               <p>He that pleaseth may read the story of the remaining 21 Sessions in <hi>Padre Paul</hi>; and having so done, let him, if he be impartial, judge whether it be probable, that such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men should be blessed by God, to find out tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in which those Popish Divines which went the way that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi> did of old and <hi>Arminius</hi> of late, prevailed, <hi>whilest use was made only of corrupt carnal humane reason; but when the testimonies of Scripture came to be examined, they were manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overcome,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> himself tells us out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable <hi>Servits Hist. pag.</hi> 15.

From these two mens acknowledgements and confessions I infer, that seeing some are absolutely elected and converted by an insuperable grace, therefore absolute election and grace insuperable are not contrary to Divine Wisdom or Goodness or Justice, do not destroy the Liberty of mans Will, and therefore are but weakly impugned when they are impugned by arguments drawn from these <hi>Topicks.</hi> But if that will do the Doctor any courtesie, or if he think it any credit to his cause, I will grant him, that tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here the <hi>Doctor</hi> tells us, <hi>That we need not take much pains in looking after the judgement of the</hi> Lutheran <hi>Churches, which come so neer to that of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>as to be reckoned for the same.</hi> That he may not seem to be mistaken in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them the same, he doth <hi>pag.</hi> 32, 33, extract out of the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confession the Doctrine of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches in the five points, only adding one clause to the first Article, out of the writings of <hi>Melancthon</hi> and other learned men of that perswasion. Well, what is this addition? <hi>God behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Man-kind in their wretched condition, was pleased to make a general conditional Decree of Predestination, under the condition of Faith and Perseverance; and a special absolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Electing those to Life whom he foresaw would Believe and Persevere under the Means and Aids of Grace, Faith &amp; Persever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and a special absolute Decree of Condemning them whom he foresaw to abide Impenitent in their Sins.</hi>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Would not any Man in the World think that we should have had the places quoted out of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> or some other <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divine, in which these things are affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? But no such quotation is made, or so much as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted; onely in the Margin we are referred to <hi>Appello Evangelium, cap</hi> 4. as if all that Mr. <hi>Playfer</hi> faith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Lutherans</hi> were as true as Gospel, and must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved without any examination. Mr. <hi>Playfer</hi> hath four con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Arguments against this, which with him is the fourth Opinion, Why are none of them answered? For my part I see not what there is in these passages, which the most strait, narrow-throated <hi>Calvinist</hi> may not swallow; for it is not here said, that there is no other Decree of Election but that mentioned: and the <hi>Calvinist</hi> will readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that God hath decreed to save Man-kind under the condition of Faith and Perseverance; but he will also maintain, that there is another Decree by which God hath determined to bestow Faith, and Perseverance in Faith, on
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40538:40"/>
a certain number, <hi>viz.</hi> all his Elect. Bate us but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety of the phrases used in this addition, which is so great, that the Decrees of Election and Reprobation seem confounded with Justification and Condemnation, and we shall all of us subscribe to it.</p>
               <p>But to speak more distinctly about the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, The composition of it we owe to the joynt endeavours of <hi>Luther, Melancthon,</hi> and <hi>Pomeranus,</hi> (<hi>Iustus Ionas</hi> being absent when these three set about the work;) but <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthon</hi> did most in the business, a man whose both Learning and Piety were admirable, but being of too timorous a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he so drew up the <hi>Confession,</hi> which is also called an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> as that he seemed to some not to keep distance enough from the Papists, which made his Friends blame him, nor had it any good effect upon his Adversaries: Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. in an Epistle to <hi>Sigismund</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> thus writing, <hi>Augustana Confusio</hi> (so he calls it, and not <hi>Confessio,</hi>) <hi>etsi similis est cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris Haeresium pravitatibus, tamen ob eam causam periculosior est, quod levius quam caeterae a Catholicae Fidei professione de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinans, speciem quandam Religionis retinere videatur; eo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciosior aliis, quo venenum ejus occultius latet, nec eminet foras:</hi> so true is the common saying, <hi>Media via, neque a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micos parit, neque inimicos tollit. Grotius</hi> indeed tells us in his <hi>Votum pro pace,</hi> that the Anathema's of the <hi>Trent</hi> Councel were not directed against the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but against the sayings of some private Persons; and that <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperor did intercede at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confession might not be put among prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Books: But in this, as in most things that did pass between him and <hi>Rivet,</hi> he doth but delude his Reader.

Doctor <hi>Rivet,</hi> in his Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on <hi>Grotius</hi>'s <hi>Cassander,</hi> only tells us, that he had heard it so related; but <hi>Hornebeck</hi> had met with the Papal Bull it self, and exemplifieth it to the full, in his Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Bull of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> V. pag. 177, 178. It is most certain, that this Confession was never intended (whatever use be made of it now) to be <hi>a perpetual rule, or symbol for all Protestant Churches</hi>; for it was made in great haste. <hi>Scripsi</hi> (saith <hi>Melancthon</hi> in an Epistle to <hi>Flachius</hi>) <hi>Augustanam Confessionem tunc, cum haberem reprehensores multos, adjutorem neminem.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40538:41"/>
but we are told that <hi>Melancthon,</hi> in his writings, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himself not to side with Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> but rather with <hi>Arminius</hi> in that Point.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Papists in their writings stick not to charge upon <hi>Melancthon,</hi> as well as others, that Blasphemy of making God the Author of Sin. But seeing Learned Men do so differ about <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s judgement in this matter, I could not be satisfied till I had made some further enquiry. To the Epistles of <hi>Calvin</hi> I betook my self, and read over all those that passed betwixt <hi>Melancthon</hi> and him; in which I found,

In the close of that Epistle he speaks something of the question of Predestination, still holding to his old way of discoursing concerning it, which he conceived to be most plain and fittest for the people; but withal affirming, that what he held, had nothing in it of contrariety to, or inconsistency with, what Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> held.

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I must confess this is a specious Objection, and such as at the first reading of it puzzled me; I understood not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> could with truth be charged to hold, that <hi>a man once justified, can by no means lose the Holy Ghost</hi>; it being rather the opinion of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> that <hi>a man once justified, may lose the Holy Ghost:</hi> Which made me think, there was some mistake in the printed Copies which we do commonly use; or else, that this was some expression that dropped from <hi>Melancthon</hi> in haste. I looked over the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Articles that were drawn up by <hi>Luther,</hi> out of which <hi>Melancthon</hi> composed the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confession; in them I found not this expression, nor any like it: But yet I dared not to lay much stress upon this my conceit, because I knew the Anabaptists were a giddy Crew, and might differ among themselves as well as from others; and upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, I found that there were <hi>Valentinian Anabaptists</hi> in those days, who taught <hi>that when once a man was regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and had obtained the Holy Ghost, he might live as he list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and do what he would, for sin could not hurt him.</hi> Such A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists, the Calvinists do as perfectly abhor and would as soon condemn, as the most violent Lutherans: for Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists do not affirm, that <hi>let regenerate men do what they list, and take what courses they please, they shall continue in Gods grace and favour</hi>: but they teach, that <hi>he who hath the spirit, walketh after the spirit, and shall by God be made so to do.</hi> When it was objected by <hi>Bertius</hi> to <hi>Crocius,</hi> the learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor of <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if there were nothing else, this one Argument would be to me sufficient to prove, that in the <hi>Augustan Confession</hi> there is nothing contrary to the conceptions of the <hi>Zuinglians</hi> or the <hi>Calvinists</hi> about the five Points, <hi>viz.</hi> That the very year before that <hi>Confession</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:40538:44"/>
was presented to <hi>Caesar</hi> there was a Colloquy betwixt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> in which it must not be denied, but that there was too great and scandalous a difference betwixt them in the Sacramentary Doctrine: Nor could it well be conceived that it should be otherwise; for <hi>Luther</hi> had written to the Landgrave of <hi>Hesse,</hi> that the <hi>Helvetians would scarcely be brought to acknowledge their errors, and he for his part could not possibly lay aside the opinion which he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced</hi>; and as soon as he met with <hi>Bucer</hi> thought meet to bestow no better complement on him than this, that he was <hi>Homo nequam, &amp; nebulo, i. e.</hi> in plain English, <hi>A very Knave:</hi> But yet, both by what <hi>Philip Melancthon</hi> writes to <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and by what <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> writes to <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholdus</hi> a Preacher at <hi>Breme,</hi> it appears, <hi>that there was a sweet agreement betwixt the Divines on both sides about other matters:</hi> Fourteen Articles were subscribed to, the sixth whereof is this, <hi>quod Fides sit donum Dei,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Faith is the gift of God: which we obtain by no precedent works or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, nor attain by our own proper strength; but the holy Spirit giveth and worketh Faith in our hearts, when we hear the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel or word of Christ:</hi> Which if our <hi>Arminians</hi> would hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge, who is he that would deny them the <hi>right hand of fellowship?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, the later Brood of <hi>Lutherans</hi> may do well to observe, that harsher speeches do not occur in any <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist</hi> than are to be found in <hi>Luther</hi> himself; and that he, as well as <hi>Iohn Calvin,</hi> was charged to make God the Author of Sin, and to put contrary wills in God, as may be seen 2. <hi>Tom. Epist. pag.</hi> 281.</p>
               <p>Is not this enough? Why then let us proceed further, even to that second meeting at <hi>Torga,</hi> held, as I take it, in the year 1576, in which these six men were Presidents, <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus Andreas, Chemnitius, Selveccerus, Chytraeus, Musculus, Cerverus,</hi> and composed that Book which is called <hi>Liber con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae,</hi> which contains in it, besides the <hi>Apostolical, Nicene, Athanasian Creeds, the Augustan Confession, the Smalcaldian Articles, the two Catechisms of</hi> Luther, <hi>&amp;c. a solid, full, clear repetition and declaration of those Articles of the</hi> Augustan <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, about which there had been any controversie among Divines.</hi> If the <hi>Arminians</hi> should have recourse to this <hi>Concord,</hi> all which they would get might (as we say) be

                  </gap> have men Repent, what is the meaning? Is this it? that there are some whose Impenitence God resolves not to cure, unto whom he decreed not to give the Grace of Repentance? Why who can question this? If the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, that there are some whom God never put under an obligation to Repent, unto whom he never made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance a duty, I must needs say, I am yet to learn the name of that Divine who hath affirmed any such thing. Alas! that Scholars should not distinguish betwixt <hi>Gods will of purpose determining of events,</hi> and his <hi>legislative will determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the creatures duty</hi>; or once imagine that <hi>there is a contrariety betwixt these two wills.</hi> The Conference ended, <hi>Beza</hi> desired that notwithstanding any difference, they might still look upon one another as Brethren; which <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas</hi> would not yield to, offering <hi>Beza dextram humanitatis,</hi> but not <hi>dextram fraternitatis.</hi>

               <p>The summ of all that I would have observed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> is, That the more ancient of them do not differ from the Calvinists in the Articles of <hi>Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> or <hi>Perseverance</hi>; the latter do differ from them somewhat (though not so much as the Arminians) in both: yet the latter and worser sort of Lutherans, do so lay down the Doctrine of <hi>Free-will,</hi> that they may easily be driven to grant both <hi>absolute Election,</hi> and <hi>absolute eternal Non-election</hi> or <hi>Preterition.</hi> For as <hi>Hornbeck</hi> well, <hi>Summa Contro. p.</hi> 726, 727,
<q>This being once granted, that it is not by our own strength or concourse that we are converted, but only and meerly by the grace and operation of the Spirit, it follows, that men cannot be converted but by this his grace, and that they are then only converted
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40538:47"/>
when this grace is given: Now all are not converted, but some; to some therefore, and not to all, is this grace given. Could not God give the same grace of Conversion to others? He could doubtless, but doth not. If he doth not, it is because he would not. Whatever God doth not in time do, he from all eternity decreed and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not to do: If God from all eternity decreed not to give his grace, he did also, I trow, decree not to grant them salvation; for salvation is never promised but to the converted.</q>

               <p>By this time it appears that the Doctor and his Party have little reason to lay any claim to the <hi>Augustan Confession,</hi> or those who glory in following it.

themselves unmeet for Mercy, what more injustice is there in rejecting millions of men, than in rejecting of one single man? I, but this is harsh, <hi>that God should lay on</hi> Adam <hi>an unavoidable necessity of falling into Sin and Misery:</hi> Perhaps if it had been said, that God had laid on <hi>Adam</hi> an <hi>avoidable necessity,</hi> it would have well enough pleased the Doctor; but then others would have thought, that an <hi>avoidable necessity</hi> had bordered a little too near the coasts of non-sense and contradiction. But is it not unworthy of God, to say, that <hi>he did lay on</hi> Adam <hi>a necessity of falling into Sin and Misery?</hi> Not unworthy of him to be sure, to lay a necessity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miserable in case he sinned: Some rather question, whether it would not have been unworthy of him to let sinful man pass without punishment, unless on some such valuable consideration as the suffering of a Mediator? As for laying a necessity on <hi>Adam</hi> of falling into Sin, that is indeed an uncouth phrase; and if the meaning of it be this, that God compelled <hi>Adam,</hi> of himself unwilling, to fall, I have not charity enough to excuse it of Blasphemy. But, as I said before, we are not told where the phrase occurs in Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi> This seemeth to be the whole of his opinion, <hi>That God did eternally decree to permit the fall of</hi> Adam; <hi>and God having decreed to permit his fall, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary he should fall.</hi> That man, whom we shall shortly have our Historian endeavouring to justifie, <hi>Arminius,</hi> hath laid it down as a truth, <hi>That if God permits a man to will this or that, it must needs be, that no kind of argument can move him not to will it.</hi>

               <p>Is that a Doctrine of reproach among the Papists, that hath been defended by so many learned Doctors of the Papal Church? Perhaps though the Doctor will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the Puritan Protestant, worthy the name of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant, yet he thinks the Puritan Papist or Jesuit, the onely Papist: If so, I cannot deny but that the Doctrine of absolute Reprobation is to them odious enough. <hi>Molina</hi> in his 23. <hi>Quest. Art.</hi> 4, 5, having granted, that his Schoolmen do commonly maintain absolute Reprobation, and not daring to deny but that <hi>Austin</hi> maintained it too, concludes that <hi>Its too hard and unworthy of the Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and clemency, more meet for a fierce and cruel than for a most clement Prince, the Author of all consolation, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, piety.</hi>

               <p>But yet I am sure <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Benedictus Pererius</hi> were both Jesuits, and (if we may believe the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of learned men concerning them) as learned as any two that ever were of that Order; yet either I understand not their Latine (which is easie enough,) or they do not speak with reproach concerning the absolute Decree. <hi>Bellarm. de grat. &amp; lib. arbit. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 16, <hi>Dicimus repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bationem duos actus comprehendere, alterum negativum, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum positivum; siquidem reprobi opponuntur electis contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, &amp; contrarie.

               <p n="2">2. The Doctor tells us that this Calvinistical Doctrine is

offensive to the <hi>Lutherans of what sort soever.</hi> Which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ever intended that we should believe, I know not; but I cannot in the least imagine that he himself believed it.

If therefore any of them have said or written, that <hi>they would sooner fall back to Popery, than give way to this Predestinarian Pestilence,</hi> they were sure in some high fit of passion; such as they are in when they speak of the Sacramentarian Pestilence, such as that Arminian was in who professed, <hi>he would sooner turn Atheist than Calvinist.</hi>

               <p>Be it so: that, of what account the Master of the Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the same had <hi>Calvin</hi> amongst the Preachers of the Reformed Churches purchased; yet we know that the Papists themselves have their Points, in which they say that <hi>Hic Magister non tenetur:</hi> so the Preachers of the Reformed Churches would undoubtedly have rejected <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> in the Point of the absolute Decree, had they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it to be either disconsonant to Scripture, or injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God, or destructive to the power of godliness.</p>
               <p>I cannot also but take notice of another Calumny, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the cause of the removal of</hi> Castalio, <hi>was his contradicting of</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin <hi>and</hi> Beza <hi>in the Doctrine of God's Decrees:</hi> whereas upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination it will be found, that he was commanded to depart <hi>Geneva</hi> for his notorious Calumnies against those that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served better of the Church than himself.

               <p>The next thing we shall take notice of in our Historian, is the account that he gives of the <hi>Supralapsarian</hi> and <hi>Sublap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarian</hi> Opinion, and the Arguments he brings against the one and the other. His account is drawn by the Pen of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Adversaries, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> and <hi>Tilenus.</hi> His Arguments are all of them transcribed out of that English Pamphlet, called <hi>God's Love to Mankind</hi>; composed by the joint labours and endeavours of two Men that were no Punies in these Controversies, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hoard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where, first, I might take notice of this, as one instance of his failing, that he hath not reckoned up all the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about the object of Predestination. For as some make it to be <hi>mankind not yet created, massam nondum conditam</hi>; others <hi>mankind created and corrupted:</hi> so there are who make it to be <hi>mankind created indeed, but yet not corrupted or fallen.</hi> Nor are they, who go this way, so obscure as not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be mentioned, by him that undertakes to write the History of these matters. But this I could easily pardon,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40538:53"/>
did I not find him highly disingenuous, in laying down the Opinion of the Supralapsarians: Which he represents from their professed Enemies charge in the <hi>Hague-Conference.</hi> Just as if some angry Neighbour having preferred a Bill against Dr <hi>Heylin,</hi> and in that Bill charged him with more than could be proved, I should afterwards make use of this Charge as a Picture to draw Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> by. A dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate Heathen would have had more candor than to Father upon any party of Men, every Brat which a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked Adversary had laid at their door. What evidence is there, that <hi>the Opinion laid down by the Doctor,</hi> page 38, <hi>is the Opinion of the Supralapsarian Divines?</hi> Have all of them or the most famous of them either jointly or severally declared it to be their Opinion? The Writings of some Antelapsarians I have read, and have not found that they have, simply and without distinction, asserted that God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>certain to eternal life, certain to eternal death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard had to their righteousness or sin,</hi> to <hi>their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or disobedience</hi>: Nay, they seem to me plainly to say, that God never decreed to bestow <hi>salvation</hi> on any adult person, but as <hi>a reward of obedience,</hi> nor to inflict <hi>damnation</hi> upon any person, but as <hi>a reward of disobedience:</hi> Only they say, If Election be considered <hi>quoad actum elgientis,</hi> and Reprobation <hi>quoad actum reprobantis,</hi> then there can be no cause assigned either of Election or Reprobation, but only the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pleasure</hi> of the Almighty. <hi>Res volita, &amp; actus volendi,</hi> should not be confounded in a Disputation so mysterious, as this about the eternal Decrees. Whereas therefore Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> page 39, adds, <hi>That the Supralapsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Doctrine, first, makes God to be the Author of Sin, as both</hi> Piscator <hi>and</hi> Macarius, (<hi>I suppose it should be</hi> Maccovius,) <hi>and many other Supralapsarians, as well as Mr.</hi> Perkins, <hi>have positively and expresly affirmed him to be; and then, concludes him for a more unmerciful Tyrant, than all that ever had been in the World, were they joyned together,</hi> I do with some confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence aver, that this is a most manifest and malicious Calumny, exceeding (I think) all the Calumnies that ever were uttered by any Arminian. Mr. <hi>Mason</hi> in his Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Mr. <hi>Hoard</hi> had said, <hi>That none of the Supralapsarians</hi> (Piscator <hi>only and a few more of the blunter sort excepted,</hi>) <hi>had said, directly and</hi> in terminis, <hi>that God is the cause of sin.</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:40538:53"/>

Do they think that their Readers have leisure to turn over all the Writings of these <hi>blunter Supralapsarians?</hi> or any divining faculty to find out, who are intended by the <hi>few others,</hi> and the <hi>many others?</hi> For my part I will not think that any one Supralapsarian ever affirmed <hi>God to be the Author of Sin,</hi> unless I see the very place in which such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation is contained. But should I see any such thing in the Writings of Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> I should be under a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to turn <hi>Cartesian,</hi> and disbelieve my eyes; so impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and and almost impossible doth it seem to me, that a Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his piety and learning, should leave upon Record, a Position <hi>so sensless, absurd, impious.</hi> I shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the Doctor, in some good convenient time, do gather together those expressions of <hi>Piscator, Maccovius, Perkins,</hi> in which God is <hi>expresly</hi> made the Author of Sin, and publish them to the World; or else he must give the World leave to think, that he hath too much communion with the <hi>Father of Lies.</hi> Further I say, that it doth not from any Principle of the Supralapsarian follow, <hi>either that God is the Author of Sin, or that he is a verier Tyrant than ever lived upon earth</hi>; though I shall grant, that for man to do as God doth, would be the highest cruelty. I believe, with the Supralapsarian, that God hath decreed, not to bestow converting Grace upon many whom he could easily (had he so pleased) have converted. Should any man who could convert millions not convert them, and afterwards punish them with eternal torments for not being converted, he would be more cruel than ever <hi>Nero</hi> was. But is God therefore cruel, in not giving his converting Grace to those millions who perish eternally for want of it? Not at all; because he is not under a Law to contribute all that in him lieth towards the conversion of Souls: but so would man be, if he had such a conver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Well, but the Doctor proceeds further, and tells us, that <hi>this extremity being every day found more indefensible, the more moderate, and sober sort of the Calvinians, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking the Colours of their first Leaders, betook themselves into the Camp of the Rigid Lutherans, and rather chose to joyn with the Dominican Friers, than to stand to the Dictates of their Master</hi> Calvin.</p>

<q>Election is the unchangeable purpose of God, by which before the foundation of the World, according to the most free pleasure of his Will and of his meer Grace, out of all mankind, fallen through their own fault from their first integrity into sin and destruction, he hath chosen in Christ unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, a set number of certain men, neither better nor more worthy than others, but lying in the common mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery with others: Which Christ also, from all eternity, he appointed the Mediator and Head of all the Elect, and Foundation of Salvation, and so he decreed to give them to him to be saved, and by his Word and Spirit effectually to call and draw them to a communion with him; <hi>i. e.</hi> to give them a true Faith in him, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie sanctifie and finally to glorifie them, being mightily kept in the communion of his Son, to the demonstration of his mercy, and praise of the riches of his glorious grace, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.4, 5, 6. <hi>Rom</hi> 8.30.</q>

<q>The Holy Scripture herein chiefly manifests and commends unto us this eternal and free grace of our Election, in that it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, that not all men are elected, but some not elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or passed over in God's eternal election; whom doubtless God, in his most free, most just, unrepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable and unchangeable good pleasure, hath decreed to leave in the common misery (whereinto by their own default they precipitated themselves,) and not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow saving faith and the grace of coversion upon them; but leaving them in their own wayes and under just judgement, at last to condemn and everlastingly

It was also then ordained, that these Canons should be sworn to and subscribed, by all that were afterwards to be admitted, ether to the Ministry or to any Office in the University.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Repugnant to plain Texts of Scripture,</hi> Ezekiel 33.11. Rom. 11.32. 2 Joh. 3.16. 2 Tim. 2.4. 2 Pet. 3.9. Gen. 4.7. 1 Chron. 28.9. 2 Chron. 15.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Now if it should prove contrary to any one of these Scriptures, it were meet to be abandoned by all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: But many Opinions are confidently affirmed to be contrary to Scripture, which are not; Such perhaps is this. I needed not to have said <hi>perhaps</hi>; for let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that the Opinion of the Sublapsarians is but this, <hi>That God hath decreed the infallible Conversion and Salvation of certain singular Persons, and also the permission of some mens Impenitence and Perdition,</hi> and it will soon be seen, that the Scriptures produced, have not so much as as a seeming contrariety to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11, God saith, yea sweareth, <hi>that He hath no pleasure in the death of a Sinner</hi>; Therefore <hi>God never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to let sinful Creatures finally run on in their wicked wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a wild conclusion is this? Hence indeed it might be inferred, that neither spiritual nor Eternal Death do fall under that Will of God which is called his <hi>Voluntas simplicis complacentiae:</hi> But Sublapsarians do not say, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40538:56"/>
they do fall under that Will. If they did, they must also necessarily maintain, that they be things in themselves good and lovely; which none of them (that I ever met with) do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32, <hi>God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</hi> What can hence be collected? Why, <hi>The two Alls are of equal extent; How many Unbelievers there be, on so many God hath a Will of shewing Mercy; and if every Man be under Mercy, then there is no precise Will of shutting out any from possibility of Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, 1. Let it be remembred, that here it is granted, that God hath shut up all under unbelief: Which is as high an expression concerning God's providence about, and concurrence unto evil, as any used by Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When it is said, that God hath a Will of shewing Mercy on all Unbelievers: If by Mercy be understood a general Mercy, we can grant it; All Men are not only under a possibility of this Mercy, but also have some actual parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipations of it.</p>
               <p>But 3. It is plain, that the Mercy intended in the Text is not a general Mercy common to all Mankind, but such a Mercy as was never vouchsafed to some whole Nations, much less to every individual Member of those Nations; V. 30, <hi>For as ye</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Gentiles) <hi>in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief: even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</hi> Doubtless the mercy that the Gentiles obtained by the unbelief and hardness of the Jews, was the <hi>hearing of the word,</hi> and that <hi>which comes by hearing, even Faith</hi>: The mercy also that the Jews ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained through the mercy of the Gentiles, was the <hi>being provoked to jealousie</hi>; the <hi>seeing of him whom they had cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and being in bitterness</hi>; the <hi>turning of them away from iniquity,</hi> and the <hi>turning of iniquity from them.</hi> Now, doth Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> indeed think, that God did shut up every Jew and Gentile in unbelief with a design and purpose to have the Gospel preached to the <hi>singula generum</hi>? If so, he must unavoidably grant, that the Almighty is marvelously fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated in his design and purpose; for he is too good a Geographer and Historian to think, that the Gospel was ever <hi>preached,</hi> or <hi>entertained</hi> by all men that have lived, or do now live in the World.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:40538:56"/>3. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16, <hi>God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence it undeniably follows, that God will not damn any man meerly for not coming up to the terms of the old Covenant of Works; and that none shall perish, whose heart is brought to believe in Christ. Nor have the Contra-remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants denied this; and more than this cannot hence be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: For whereas Mr. <hi>Hoard</hi> argueth, <hi>God loveth the whole lump of mankind, and loved it fallen into a gulf of sin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery: He did not therefore hate the most of them lying in the fall; for love and hatred are contrary acts in God, and cannot be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised about the same objects.</hi> He sure could not but think, that we would reply, that God doth not love the whole lump of mankind with the same degree, measure, and kind of love; and that a less degree of love is sometimes in Scriptures called by the name of hatred. God had not such a love for the whole lump of mankind, as to decree to bestow upon every particular person that special grace which shall infallibly bring him to eternal life and glory. Any love less than this, many consist with absolute eternal Non-election or Preterition. Nay, God did never so love the World, as to purpose to bestow on all the parts of it the very means of knowledge: How many, notwithstanding the love this Text speaks of, are everlastingly punished, who never heard of the way to Salvation!</p>
               <p n="4">4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, <hi>Who would have all to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. In these words the Apostle delivers two things</hi>: 1. <hi>That it is God's will that all men should obtain an happy end.</hi> 2. <hi>That it is his will also that they should use and enjoy the means, which is the knowledge of his truth, that they might attain the end: There is no let in God, but that all men may believe and be saved; and therefore there is no absolute will, that many thousands of men shall never believe nor be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The thing that should be proved, is, That there is a will in God to save all men and to bring them to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth; and we have here a Scripture brought to prove, that God would have all men to be saved, as if there were no difference betwixt these two Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Deus vult omnes salvos fieri; Deus vult omnes salvos facere.</hi> If a man should lay down this assertion, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40538:57"/>
Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> hath a mind or purpose to bestow an hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> on <hi>Abingdon,</hi> and when he is called to make good that assertion, should only prove, that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> could be well pleased that an 100 <hi>per annum</hi> were given to the Town, and that there is no let in him why it hath not been given, would he not become ridiculous? Never did sober Sublapsarian say, that there is any let in God, but that all men may believe and be saved; but they do not think, that a man must presently believe and be saved, if God do not hinder his faith and salvation. 'Tis required that God should remove all the le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances of faith, cure us of our unbelief, and put his fear into our inward parts, else we shall never believe, or be saved. Let any Arminian prove, that God hath willed and purposed to do all this for every one.</p>
               <p n="5">5. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9, <hi>Not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. This is a negative Proposition, and must be taken distributively; and therefore it flatly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth absolute Reprobation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is Logick that may well make younger men than Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> and I to smile. 1. The Scripture produced is not one Proposition, but two; and if the first be negative, the second is affirmative.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What if it be taken distributively? Is there no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution, but only into the <hi>singula generum</hi>? I thought that there might be a distribution into <hi>genera singulorum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I could (notwithstanding any thing brought by Mr. <hi>Hoard</hi> to the contrary) hold, that the words are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to the Elect.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But because I can be not only honest but also liberal, I will grant, that God is not willing that any one should perish, that he is willing that every one should repent: But then I deny, that either of these two Propositions do contradict Gods decree of Reprobation; which, as hath been often said, is his decree to permit, that many shall perish in their impenitence. Mens being under this decree doth not hinder, but that God may, <hi>voluntate complacentiae,</hi> will their conversion, and patiently expect it, and afford them such means as will leave them without excuse, though such as he foreknew they would frustrate and receive in vain.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Sublapsarian Opinion fighteth with God's holiness, and makes him the cause of sin in the greatest number of men,</hi> 1. <hi>In regard that of his own will and pleasure, he hath brought mem into an estate, in which they cannot avoid sin: that is to say, by imputing to them the transgression of their Father</hi> Adam. 2. <hi>In that he leaves them irrecoverably plunged and involved in it, without affording them power or ability to rise again to newness of life: In which case that of</hi> Tertullian <hi>seems to have been fitly alledged,</hi> In cujus manu est ne quid fiat, ei deputatur cum jam fit; <hi>In whose power it is that a thing be not done, to him it is imputed when it is done.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If absolute Reprobation do indeed rob God of his holiness, let it for ever be abandoned, and not so much as named with the least approbation among Divines. But what wretched ignorance is this! whilst a man is pleading for the holiness of his Maker, to lay down such a rule, which if it prove true, doth entitle him to all the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that ever were perpetrated by the sons of men! I ask the Doctor, Could not he who kept the Heathenish King from touching <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Wife, <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> from doing mischief to <hi>Iacob,</hi> the <hi>Israelites</hi> Enemies from having so much as a mind to hurt them, so restrain the lust of all and every man, as that it should never conceive and bring forth sin and death? If he could not, he is not Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, nor fit to govern the World: If he could, sith he hath not, he is, by the Doctor's rule, become the Author of all the pollutions that have been in the World through lust. The best is, the rule is most apparently false even in reference to the creature; for a man is not guilty of all the sins which he had power to hinder, but only of those sins which by virtue of his calling and place he was bound to hinder. Let us see whether the Sublapsarians be more happy in their Principles than the Historian in his. Two Principles of theirs are taken notice of,

into an estate in which they cannot avoid sin; that is to say, by imputing to them the transgression of their Father</hi> Adam.</p>
                        <p>Little did I expect to find this Principle charged with any opposition to the holiness of God: For though it be most unhandsomly expressed, yet that which is intended by it, is but this, that It was the free constitution of God, that if <hi>Adam</hi> stood, he should transmit holiness to all his Posterity, and if he did fall and rebel, then his Posterity should be born in a condition of sin and misery.</p>
                        <p>If this be a truth, then it is not contrary to the holiness of God: If not a truth, what shall become of <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12? Let <gap reason="foreign">

If he was made a common Person, so as that his will was reputed our will, his fall our fall, he was made such by the meer will and pleasure of God; for who can think that there was any thing that necessitated God to make him such?

Had not this eating of the fruit of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden tree, all the circumstances in it that may render it out of measure sinful? Had it not something in it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all the Precepts of the natural Law? But besides, This charge of destroying God's mercy is grounded on a gross mistake: For Sublapsarians do not make Reprobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be Gods punishing men for ever, or shutting them up under an invincible necessity of sin and damnation: It is, with them, only the denying or not giving of an undue favour, which yet he is pleased graciously to vouchsafe to others, who could as little deserve it as those to whom it is denied.</p>

Sublap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarians do not say, that the far greatest part of mankind is left remedilesly in a state of damnation, for the sin of their first Father only. They affirm, that the first transgression was as truly the transgression of every one descended na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally from the loins of <hi>Adam,</hi> as of <hi>Adam</hi> himself the common Progenitor. They maintain not, that any is left remediless in a state of damnation. They acknowledge, that a remedy is by God prepared, sufficient to deliver them from the wrath to come, and that it is through the fault of men, living in the Church, if the remedy become not effectual. They also make damnation to come upon the Reprobate, not because he is a Reprobate, nor meerly and solely for original sin; but for their habitual and actual sins. It is also most false, that by the Sublapsarians God is made to require faith in Christ of those, to whom he hath denied both a power to believe, and a Christ to believe in. Those who did never hear of Christ, are not required under pain of damnation to believe in him; faith to them is no duty, and therefore infidelity is no sin: Those to whom Christ is manifested, have a Christ given them to believe in; for he is propounded to them as able to save them to the uttermost, as willing and resolved and engaged to save them upon his own terms: which are no other, than their receiving of him, and submitting to him as their Lord, to rule and govern them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, the Sublapsarians affirm God to give the Reprobate a power of believing, as great a power as the Arminians make him to give to any whether Elect or Reprobate. God never purposed effectually to work in the Reprobate both to will and to do, say the Sublapsarians: He never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed effectually to work to will and to do in any, say the Arminians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I, but God punisheth the Reprobates for the omission of an act, which is by his own Decree made impossible to them, say Sublap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarians</hi>; ergo, <hi>he is unjust.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:40538:59"/>I deny the antecedent; Some Sublapsarians say, that faith is not impossible to any who is in <hi>statu viatoris</hi>; no Sublapsarian saith, that it was the decree of God which made the act of faith impossible to any man. It is the corruption and hardness of mens hearts that makes the act of faith impossible to men, (if absolutely it be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;) but this corruption and hardness of mens hearts is not an effect of God's decree.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is indeed said (the more some mens shame and impudence) too too often; but it is not proved. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsarians do not feign God to have any purpose to remit the debt upon no terms: they plainly say, that he hath purposed to remit, on the conditions of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; should any Reprobate perform and come up to these conditions, the whole sum, how great soever, should be forgiven, and he put into the actual possession and enjoyment of the salvation offered to him in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel. I, <hi>but these conditions are such as God knows the Reprobate will not, cannot come up to: therefore, to offer salvation on such terms, is but to delude.</hi> Why, but did not God foreknow, in the Arminian way, that the Reprobate would not repent and believe? <hi>Ay; but they do not say, that God ever decreed that he should not repent and believe.</hi> Well, however he decreed, not to cure his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence or unbelief. If this be granted, the Sublapsarian hath as much as he need contend for; Reprobation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him, only a denial of that grace which makes men actually believers.

               <p>
                  <hi>All God's passionate wishes, all his terrible threatnings, the whole course of the Ministry, are by this Doctrine made to be but so many acts of deep hypocrisie in Almighty God: though none of the maintainers of it have the ingenuity to confess the same, but</hi> Piscator <hi>only, in his</hi> Necesse est ut sanctam aliquam si mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationem (<hi>lege</hi> simulationem) in Deo statuamus; <hi>which is plain and home.</hi>

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Some maintainers of absolute Reprobation do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this, but ascribe unto God <hi>Sanctam simulationem, duplicem personam, duplicem voluntatem,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Hoard.</hi>
                  </q>
But Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> taking this to be a piece of commendable ingenuity, will not allow any but <hi>Piscator</hi> alone to have any portion of it: all others are disingenuous, and do indeed make God a dissembler, but will not say so much. Surely did the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsarians conceive that so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orrid a consequence did follow upon absolute Reprobation, they would acknowledge it, and withal renounce and disclaim their opinion. Till they be thus convinced, it is no great charity to fasten disingenuity upon men so renowned for Learning and Piety, as are the Sublapsarians. But let us look once more on this scoffing passage; <hi>All God's wishes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>must be but so many acts of deep hypocrisie; though none of the maintainers of this Opinion be so ingenuous as to confess the same but</hi> Piscator. The Opinion he is speaking of, is the Sublapsarian Opinion; and so the sense is, None of the Sublapsarian Opinion, save only <hi>Piscator</hi> who was no Sublapsarian, but a Supralapsarian: Is not this fine sense? Besides, <hi>sanctam quandam simulationem,</hi> cannot well be rendred by <hi>deep hypocrisie.</hi> Lastly, how shall I be assured that any such words as these here quoted, are to be found in <hi>Piscator?</hi> Neither Page nor Book is quoted, yet I have met with the place; and by reading it can easily gather, that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> either never read it, or had not ingenuity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to quote it aright: For whereas <hi>Vorstius</hi> had objected to <hi>Piscator,</hi> that he fastned simulation on God in the case of the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> and the message sent to <hi>Hezekiah</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he replieth, <hi>Tu hic pugnas sine adversario; nam neque ego affirmavi facile aliquam simulationis speciem Deo tribuendam esse, neque exempla illa</hi> Ezekiae <hi>&amp;</hi> Ninivitarum <hi>huc retuli: interim non puto ab illis exemplis alienum esse, ut sancta Dei simulatio in illis statuatur.</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:40538:60"/>
Here is no <hi>necesse est</hi>; nothing like an affirmation, that the maintainers of absolute Reprobation must necessarily ascribe a simulation unto God. Honest <hi>Piscator</hi> never dreamed that the message sent to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by <hi>Isaiah,</hi> or to the <hi>Ninevites</hi> by <hi>Ionah,</hi> was the Decree of Reprobation: All he seems to intend, is but this, that God seemed in those messages to be peremptorily resolved of that, which he never resolved should come to pass: And if his expression were not so accurate, Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> who almost in every period lieth at the Readers mercy, should not have cavilled at it.</p>
               <p>By the way let it be noted, that how slightly soever our present Arminians do think or speak of <hi>Piscator,</hi> yet <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> himself either had honourable thoughts of him, or else was a most notorious dissembler: For writing to <hi>Utengobard</hi> concerning one to succeed <hi>Iunius,</hi> then la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Finally, it is alledged, that this Doctrine of the Sublapsarians, is contrary to the ends by God proposed in the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to many of God's excellent gifts to the sons of men; to all endeavours unto holiness and godly living; and to those grounds of comfort by which a conscience in distress should be relieved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> All this is indeed alledged by Mr. <hi>Hoard,</hi> but it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied also by all the Sublapsarians; and had the Doctor vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to bring Mr. <hi>Hoard</hi>'s Reasons, they should have had their Answer: but where he counts it sufficient barely to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, there I count it enough to deny. But however, I shall take notice of two Stories; whereof the first is said to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, the second to evince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:40538:61"/>The illustrating History in concerning <hi>Tiberius Caesar,</hi> of whom <hi>Suetonius</hi> saith, <hi>Circa Deos &amp; Religiones negligentior erat, quippe addictus Mathematicae, persuasionisque plenus, omnia fato agi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The evincing Story is the miserable example of the Landgrave of <hi>Turing</hi> (related not by <hi>Heistibachius,</hi> but <hi>Heisterbachius,</hi>) who being admonished of his vitious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, and dangerous condition, made his Friends this Answer, <hi>Si praedestinatus, nulla peccata poterint mihi Regnum Coelorum auferre; si praescitus, nulla opera mihi illud valebunt conferre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A man would almost think that this prophane Land-grave was a piece of an <hi>Arminian,</hi> because he opposeth <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinatus &amp; praescitus:</hi> whereas the <hi>Calvinists</hi> take Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination in its latitude, and make Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to be contained under it. But however, this I am sure of, that a Monk in S. <hi>Austin</hi>'s time, being reproved by his Friends for his wickedness, answered, Whatsoever I am now, I shall be such as God foreseeth I will be. Shall we deny God's Prescience, because a wretched Monk abused it? No more must we deny Predestination, because the Land-grave of <hi>Turing</hi> did turn it into wantonness and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciviousness. Had either Supralapsarian, or Sublapsarian, been present when the Land-grave uttered these words, it would have been answered, That though he were Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated, yet should he never be saved if he continued in his sins; and That though he were Reprobate, yet he should not miss of Heaven, if he continued by patience in well-doing to seek for it. Salvation and Damnation are alway (if we speak of the adult) <hi>secundum bona, &amp; mala opera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tiberius</hi> confuted himself; for though he pretended a full perswasion of a Mathematical fate or destiny, yet, as the same Historian observeth, he was out of measure afraid of Thunders, and when the Air was cloudy, he always did wear on his head a Crown of Laurel. We may pity his ignorance, in thinking that there was any virtue in the Laurel to keep him from Thunder; but cannot choose but detest his Hypocrisie, who in words maintained a Fate, and yet endeavoured to secure his life by as many means as were used by them that held no Fate. As much
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40538:61"/>
is their Hypocrisie to be abhorred, who take occasion from the irreversibleness of God's Decrees to neglect their Souls: and yet the irreversibleness of those Decrees notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mind their Bodies as much or more, than any persons in the World besides.</p>
               <p>To conclude; Would it not exasperate, I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in those, who whilst they were prophane, were <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> to the full: but left their <hi>Arminianism</hi> as they left their loosness; their own experience in conversion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing them, that Faith was the gift of God in another way than the <hi>Arminians</hi> ever thought of. He that question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this, may be in part satisfied by reading the History of the Life and Death of the executed Irish Bishop, published by Dr. <hi>Bernard.</hi> To my grief I observe, that there are multitudes of stupid and prophane wretches in the World: With some of them I have occasion to converse; and I find, that one main thing which keepeth them in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality is a perswasion, that there is an universal grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and tendered to all, by which they may repent and believe when they will: they therefore resolve, they will enjoy the pleasures of sin a little longer, and then they will receive and entertain the grace of God; and so get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as sure as the strictest and earliest Puritans. Yea, this was the refuge and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of that grand Propagator of <hi>Arminianism</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomson:</hi> If any one in a fit of intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, minded him of the wrath of God threatned against such courses, he would answer, <hi>I am a Child of the Devil to day; but I have Free-will, and to morrow I will make my self a Child of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So I come to the fifth Chapter of the <hi>Historian,</hi> in which we have some account given of the <hi>Remonstrants</hi>; Unto whom it will be found, that he hath discovered too much charity, though he could find in his heart to shew none at all to the <hi>Contraremonstrants.</hi>

               <p>His first Proposition is this, <hi>That the Remonstrants Opinion though accused of Novelty, is Ancienter than Calvinism in the Churches of the</hi> Belgick <hi>Provinces; which being originally Dutch, did first embrace Religion according to the Lutheran mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A Proposition, concerning which he hath reason to pray, that it may meet with very easie and credulous Readers, else he may well expect it will be queried, 1. How it appears that the Lutheran and Calvinian model were then, as to the points of Grace and the Decrees, any way opposite? 2. How it can be proved, that on supposition the Lutheran and Calvinian platform were distinct, the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches did first embrace Religion according to the Lutheran, and not the Calvinian platform? To which second Question, it will in no wise be a satisfactory Answer to reply, That <hi>Hardingbergius, Clemens Martini, Henricus Antonides,</hi> had opinions about Predestination differing from Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>: For granting this, yea, and granting further, that they had been through-paced Remonstrants, it need not be yielded, that the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches were Lutheran; for there might be at the same time men every way as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and as likely to draw Disciples after them, that were Calvinistical. It is a truth known to all that are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unacquainted with the Stories of the Low-Countries, that though in the dawning of Reformation, the Preachers were not all of a mind; yet as things grew to a settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Pelagian Leaven was purged out, a Confession of Faith published, (which was afterwards called <hi>Belgica Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessio,</hi>) in which the Doctrine of Predestination is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> explained it at <hi>Geneva:</hi> this was in the year 1566, or 1567.</p>

the ensuing Synods of 1576, and 1586, and approved of by the States of <hi>Holland:</hi> Yet not so practised, but that in the want of others more Orthodox, there crept in some that taught things contrary both to the <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism,</hi> whose hard names I will not fill my papers with. These men had not, notwithstanding all their restless en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, any great success: all things were reasonable quiet, till <hi>Arminius</hi> came to be Divinity Professor at <hi>Leyden,</hi> which was <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. Concerning which <hi>Arminius</hi> or <hi>Van Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> we must give a short account.</p>
               <p>He was at first a Tapster or Chamberlain in a common Inn, from whence by the care of some Guests (who were pleased even to admiration with his prompt wit) he was removed, and set to School; maintained there out of the Publick Treasury of <hi>Amsterdam:</hi> where in process of time he was by the Magistrates of the City made Pastor, and preached with that accurateness and solidity, that every one thought him for his parts meet to be a Professor. Indeed <hi>magnus esse potuit, si minor esse voluit:</hi> he might have been high enough, had he not thought meet to raise himself higher, by trampling upon those whom the Churches of Christ have most deservedly had in the greatest admiration. The learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iunius</hi> being dead, <hi>Utengobard</hi> thought none so meet to succeed him as <hi>Van Harmine</hi>; but the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches knew him too well, to let him easily come to such a place, in which he might influence all that were Candidates for the Ministry. The Deputies of the Churches did admonish <hi>Utengobard,</hi> that he would cease to commend a man <hi>so sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,</hi> to the Curators of the University of <hi>Leyden</hi>: but he, too proud to regard such admonitions, desisted not to commend <hi>Arminius,</hi> till he had brought him in to <hi>Iunius</hi>'s Chair. But first a dismission must be obtained from <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> which could not easily be got; the Inhabitants of the City being taken with his Eloquence, the Presbytery (at least the wiser part of them) thinking that he did far less hurt at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> than he would do at <hi>Leyden,</hi> a place where Youth was formed, and where there was more liberty of teaching and prophecying than in a particular Church.

and open declaration of his Opinion, free himself from all suspition of Heterodoxy; and that he should promise, if he had any singular Opinions, he would not discover them to the disturbance of the Churches. <hi>Arminius,</hi> if we may judge of his mind by what he writes to <hi>Utengobard,</hi> was not unwilling to come to this Conference; for these are his words, from <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> to <hi>Utengobard,</hi> 4. <hi>Martii,</hi> 1603, <hi>Non vereor in</hi> Arnoldi, Helmichii, Gomari, <hi>&amp; quorumvis aliorum, qui istarum rerum peritissimi habentur, conspectu &amp; praesentia de illis disserere, probe mihi conscius de sententiae meae veritate, &amp; illorum censuram minime reformidans; quod tibi idcirco dico, ne hoc ipse timidius urgeas. Haesi quidem aliquando circa non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nullos articulos, non eousque tamen, ut quae de illis creditu ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaria ex Scripturis probari possunt, non adprobaverim; sed jam per diuturnas &amp; assiduas meditationes id consecutus mihi videor, ut de omnibus &amp; singulis rationem reddere non exti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mescam.</hi> Accordingly a Conference there was, before the Curators of the University, and the Deputies of the Synod; in which <hi>Arminius</hi> most expresly denied and condemned the Opinions of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> concerning <hi>Grace, Free-will, Original Sin, Perfection in this Life, Predestination</hi>; adding, that he approved all that <hi>Augustin,</hi> and other Fathers had written against <hi>Pelagius</hi>; promising also to read nothing dissonant to the received Doctrine. Hereupon he was admitted Professor; and for some time he defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches in the Points of <hi>Christ's Satisfaction, Iustifying Faith, Iustification by Faith, Perseverance in Faith, Certainty of Salvation,</hi> and such other matters as afterwards he denied, and <hi>which he then</hi> (as is acknowledged by his good Friend <hi>Corvinus</hi>) <hi>maintained against his conscience.</hi> He seems by all his carriage, to be one that was resolved not to venture any further into the sea, than tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Would <hi>Barnevelt</hi> have publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertaken his Patronage, then he would have ventured to proclaim defiance to all Dissenters; but <hi>Barnevelt</hi> not daring so to do, the valiant Professor contented himself mostly to instil his Notions and Principles into some of his Confidents: magnifying <hi>Castalio, Cornhertius, Suarezius,</hi> and as much vilifying <hi>Calvin, Beza, Martyr, Zanchy, Ursin</hi>; yet when he was accused so to do, he peremptorily denieth
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40538:63"/>
himself to be in the least guilty of discommending <hi>Calvin,</hi> or commending <hi>Cornhert</hi>; as may be seen in his Epistle to <hi>Sebastian Egbert,</hi> bearing date <hi>May</hi> 3. 1607, <hi>pag.</hi> 236. (Which is the usual way and method of Hereticks,) he expressed himself in such terms, as would serve to insinuate his own private Heterodox Opinions: and yet if he were questioned for them, he knew how to reconcile them to the Confessions and Catechism; contrary to which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, in a Letter to <hi>Utengobard,</hi> that he never did say any thing in publick. He dreaded a Synod as the shadow of death; and thereupon set himself to make the Authority of the Magistrate in Ecclesiastical affairs, to be all in all: and when he saw that all his Policy notwithstanding, a Synod was like to be called, and he in that Synod like to be made answer for himself, seised upon with sorrow and overwhelmed with grief, he fell sick and died, <hi>Anno</hi> 1609, <hi>Octob.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>Two things more I would have observed concerning <hi>Arminius,</hi> 1. That in the set Conference betwixt him and <hi>Gomarus,</hi> not long before his death, he declared that <hi>he had never opposed the Doctrine of the certain Perseverance of Saints, and that he would not then oppose it: because such testimonies might be brought for it out of the Scriptures, as he was not able to answer: he would therefore only propound such places as made him somewhat to scruple and doubt about that matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He would not then consent to have <hi>Adolphus Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator</hi> dismissed, and to take another Pastor in his place; though <hi>Venator</hi> was at that time, as well for the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his life, as his Doctrine, under the just censure of the Church.</p>
               <p>If the Remonstrants count it any way for their honour, to fight under such a Captain or Leader, let them enjoy their phantasie. Had not our first Reformers been endued with more courage and resolution, Religion had never made that progress among us, that now it hath. I'le never think any Opinion worth embracing, whose Author either doubts of it, or durst not suffer for it. However, glad I should be if they who follow, or rather out-run <hi>Arminius</hi> in the five Points, would be of the same mind with him as to the Pope of <hi>Rome:</hi> of whom he thus writes in an Epistle to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bastian
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40538:64"/>
Egbert,</hi> bearing date <hi>Septemb.</hi> 24. 1608, <hi>Aperte profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor me Pontificem Romanum pro membro corporis Christi non habere; sed pro hoste, pro perduelle, pro sacrilego, pro blasphemo, pro tyranno, &amp; violentissimo injustissimae in Ecclesiam domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis usurpatore, pro homine peccati, pro filio perditionis, pro exlege illo celeberrimo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well had it been for the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, if <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianism</hi> and <hi>Arminius</hi> had both died together: but they did not. Breaches, as the Doctor truly notes, <hi>pag.</hi> 49, <hi>grew wider and wider.</hi> The Remonstrants, having no hopes their cause should succeed, if debated in a full and lawful Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, endeavour to shelter themselves under the wing of the Civil Magistrates; whose favour that they might be the more sure to gain, they ceased not upon all occasions to imbitter the Civil Powers against all the Pastors that were of a perswasion contrary to theirs, <hi>speaking and Printing of them, as if they were enemies to Magistracy, and introduced an Ecclesiastical Power collateral and equal to the Civil:</hi> (an Artifice that Hereticks have alway used when they have been put to their shifts.) Not content thus to reproach their Brethren, they further propound, if there must needs be a Synod, it might consist <hi>not of Persons delegated by the Churches, but of certain nominated by the Magistrate.</hi> Thinking that by this device they had put themselves out of all fear of Synodical censure, they make an open Schism, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent a Remonstrance to the States of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>West-Friesland; in which they neither nakedly and plainly declared their own Opinions, nor candidly represented the Tenents of their Adversaries.</hi> Much they endeavoured that no Copy of this Remonstrance might be given out; but at length a Copy was got, and a Contraremonstrance made. The Doctor tells us, that</p>

                  <hi>The</hi> Remonstrants <hi>gained exceedingly upon their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries: for the whole Controversie being reduced to these five Points; the Method and Order of Predestination; the Efficacy of Christ's Death; the Operations of Grace, both before and after Conversion; and Perseverance in the same; the Parties were admitted to a publick Conference at the</hi> Hague, <hi>Anno</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:40538:64"/>
1611, <hi>in which the Remonstrants were conceived to have much the better of the day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But if a man may be so bold, Who were they that conceived the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> had much the better of the day? The <hi>Remonstrants</hi> themselves? <hi>Proprio laus sordet in ore.</hi> The <hi>Contra-remonstrants?</hi> They never so conceived, but rather reported themselves Victors. When were the Differences reduced to five Heads? Not before the <hi>Hague</hi> Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I am sure; for the Deputies of the Churches charged the Followers of <hi>Arminius</hi> with Heterodoxies, in more Points than the five now mentioned, as appears by all the complaints exhibited against them. And there fell out something, which might justly give the World occasion to think, that the Remonstrants were leavened with Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism, as well as with Pelagianism. For care being taken to chose one who might succeed <hi>Arminius</hi> in his Professors place, the Remonstrants thought none so meet as <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius</hi>; a man strongly suspected to be a great favourer of <hi>Socinus,</hi> and who had then newly Printed a Book, in the which he ascribed unto God, <hi>Quantity, Composition, Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, Passive Power, and such other imperfections, as are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether repugnant to his perfect Essence:</hi> yet at the Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Remonstrants professed unanimously, <hi>that they had found nothing in the Writings of</hi> Vorstius, <hi>contrary either to Truth or Piety.</hi> At the Conference also the Contra-remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants urged, that there were more things controverted betwixt them and the Remonstrants, than were contained in the five Articles.</p>
               <p>I shall make a few Annotations on the five Articles of the Remonstrants,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That Almighty God ordained to save all those, in Christ, for Christ, through Christ, who being faln, and under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of sin, by the assistance of the Holy Ghost, do pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>vere in Faith and Obedience to the very end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Article is such, as no Christian would deny; yet the Remonstrants do lay down such Assertions, as do by most necessary consequence quite overthrow this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. For <hi>Poppius,</hi> a man of note and renown among them, seems much to doubt,
<q>Whether a late, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so serious Repentance, do avail a man to Salvation? Nay, he expresly affirms, (<hi>in praxi Consolationis aegrotantium.</hi>) that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40538:65"/>
he is destitute of any Promise so universal, as that by it any one who dies with but a death-bed serious Repentance, can be assured that he shall go to Heaven; and that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain whether such late serious Penitents, go with the Thief into Paradise, or with those that die in their Sins to Hell.</q>
Nor is this the singular opinion of <hi>Poppius,</hi> I can shew the same in <hi>Episcopius</hi>; not to mention some of our own here in <hi>England.</hi>
                  <q>The Sublapsarians make the object of Reprobation, man fallen into Sin; the Remonstrants say, that man recovered out of Sin by true Repentance, may be the object of Reprobation and Damnation.</q>
How easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might I, if I took pleasure in recriminations, tell them of ascribing Tyranny, Hypocrisie, Respect of Persons unto God? But I only desire my Reader to consider, whether the Remonstrant do not Preach another Gospel, than what hath been hitherto taught in the Churches of Christ? Nothing was thought more undoubted, than that he who believes shall be saved: The Remonstrant saith, this is not necessarily true; and that thousands and millions of true Believers may go to Hell. How will such as these deal with an Unbeliever that is but twenty years old? Will they perswade him to believe in Christ? He will ask them, what encouragement they can give him to believe? Will they reply, Salvation is promised to Believers in Christ? He will rejoyn; Can you give me any Promise, that I shall live long enough to shew sorth my Faith by my Works? If you cannot, there's but small encouragement to believe; for, to a late, though serious Believer, you say, there is no certain promise of Salvation. But let us leave the Remonstrants to reconcile themselves to their own Decree, and take notice, that at the Conference the Remonstrants were further ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1. Whether they made this Article to contain the whole and entire Decree of Predestination? 2. Whether they made Faith and Perseverance in Faith, causes or conditions which did antecede Election unto Salvation, or fruits which grow out of Election and so follow it? After some ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giversation, they said, 1.
<q>That they acknowledged no other Predestination, than that which they had in their first Article expressed. 2. That Faith did, in the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> precede Election to Salvation, and was not a fruit of it.</q>
This is their opinion about the Decree,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40538:65"/>
which, now that it is opened, appears to be as repugnant to Scripture, as before, when it was wrapped up, it seemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable. Were this Opinion true, it should not be said, that we are elected that we may be holy, but because we were holy: nor would the Holy Ghost have said, as many as were ordained to eternal life believed; but, as many as believed were ordained to eternal life.</p>
               <p>The second Article, as translated by the Doctor, <hi>pag.</hi> 50 is, <hi>That Iesus Christ suffered death for all men, and in every man; that by his death upon the Cross<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he might obtain for all mankind forgiveness of sins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with this condition notwithstanding, that none but true Believers should enjoy the benefit of the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and forgiveness of sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have, if I forget not, in the Pamphlets of some Quakers, read this phrase of Christ's suffering death <hi>in every man,</hi> and looked upon it as non-sense; so I do still, and therefore will hope it never dropped from the Doctor's Pen, but is to be put among the Errata's of the Printer. As to the Article it self, I can easily grant it to be <hi>a truth,</hi> (though all Contra-remonstrants do not); but it is not <hi>all the truth.</hi> Christ died not with an intent onely to make man reconcileable and salvable, but also to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase for some, whom the Scriptures call Elect, the very graces of Faith and Repentance. Here therefore is the Question betwixt us, Whether Christ died with the same intention for all? Remonstrants affirm, Contra-remonstrants deny. Christ hath procured, that whoever comes to the Father through him, shall be saved; but there are also some, for whom he hath procured that they shall come to the Father.</p>
               <p>The third and fourth Articles are so worded, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing but the truth, though not all the truth; save that in the end of the fourth it is said, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for the manner of the co-operation of Grace, it is not to be thought irresistible, in regard that it is said of many in the holy Scriptures, that they did resist the Holy Ghost,</hi> Act. 7, <hi>and in other places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which is a very rude Assertion, either impertinent or false. If the meaning be, that some operations of the Holy Spirit are resisted, some of his motions quenched, who ever denied this? If the meaning be, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40538:66"/>
work of the Spirit may be resisted in some degree and measure, that will not be gainsaid neither: But this we say, <hi>that converting Grace doth determine the Will: that Grace effectual, doth not leave the Will at liberty utterly to resist it, or not; but taketh away that which would resist or make head against the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the fifth Article, it seems they did not know their own minds: They profess <hi>that such as are ingrafted into Christ by a lively Faith, may be Conquerours; Christ is ready to assist them, if for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> parts they prepare themselves to the encounter, and beseech his help, and are not wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in performing duties: But they say, it is first to be well weighed and proved by the holy Scripture, Whether they may not by their own negligence, forsake those Principles of saving Grace, by which they are sustained in Christ? before they can publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach these Doctrines with any sufficient tranquility or assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which is no more than may be said of that funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Doctrine concerning the Trinity: for it must first be well weighed, Whether the Scriptures do hold forth a Trinity of Persons? before a man ventures pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to Preach that Mystery. I think that if we search the Scriptures, it will soon be found, that though the Regenerate may lose the Spirit of God, and would soon lose him if they were left to themselves; yet there is a promise by which God hath engaged himself, not to let sin so far prevail in them as quite to extinguish the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, totally to destroy the new Creature and workmanship of God.</p>
               <p>One would think that the Remonstrants, who thus poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sought to hide their Opinions, should not have much reason to brag of the success of the Conference; yet Dr. <hi>Hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> is resolved to tell us, that</p>

                  <hi>The Contra-remonstrants had the worst, and finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves not to have thrived much better by their Pen-combats, than in that of the Tongue, they betook themselves to other courses, vexing and molesting their Opposites in their Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or Consistories, endeavouring to silence them from Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Conference, I find the States enjoyning both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to give in their judgements, what they thought the best way for the composing of the Controversies that were in the Church, which did much endanger the Peace of the Commonwealth. The Remonstrants, in order to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, propounded, <hi>that there might be a Toleration, both Parties being permitted freely to Teach and Publish their Opinion.</hi> The Contra-remonstrants judged the best way for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of the Differences was this, <hi>that a</hi> National Synod <hi>should be called, in which it might be determined which Opinion was most agreeable to Scripture, and to the common judgement of the Reformed Churches.</hi> These two ways being propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the States, they were divided in their Opinions, and so nothing could be determined: only they enjoyned, in order to the crushing of the <hi>Vorstian</hi> Party, that none should teach otherwise concerning <hi>Christ's Satisfaction for our Sins, the Iustification of Men before God, Saving Faith, Original Sin, Certainty of Salvation,</hi> than had been taught in other Reformed Churches, and in those Provinces. If ever men forsook the Word, and betook themselves to the Sword, the Remonstrants did. <hi>Adolphus Venator,</hi> when Magistrates were chosen that favoured not his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, stirred up the common Rabble against them; nor would this Rabble rest, till their Magistrates had been thrown out of their places, and others put into them: who had no sooner got the Government of the City into their hands, than they proceeded, by the instigation of <hi>Venator,</hi> to lay by the Elders and Deacons, and to deprive the two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, <hi>Petrus Cornelii</hi> and <hi>Cornelius Hellenius,</hi> of their places. The like was done by the procurement of that Superficiary Creature <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> to <hi>Cornelius G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>selius.</hi> What should I speak of the Persecutions raised by the Remonstrants against all those that (not knowing how to joyn in communion with them) did only go to some Orthodox Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40538:67"/>
that would feed them with Bread and not Poison? The banishing, or incarceration of so many Contraremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants shews, that the Remonstrants would not grant that Toleration unto others, which they so earnestly desired for themselves. But at last King <hi>Iames</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> prevailed so far upon the States, that a National Synod was like to be called: What do the Remonstrants now? Why they go about to perswade some States-men, that a National Synod was contrary to the Liberty of the Provinces; for every Province had a Power, a supream independent Power, to determine concerning Religion as was by the Rulers of the Province judged most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: that this Power was to be maintained even to the taking up of Arms, and the Hazard of their Lives. These Seditious Speeches did so wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> upon some Governours of Cities, that making a conspiracy, they decreed to raise Souldiers, that should be neither under the States General, nor the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> In how many places this was done, it matters not to relate; but by this means such a Civil war had been raised, as would have had worse conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents than ever had all the Wars with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had not the States General required the Prince of <hi>Orange to imprison the Heads of this Conspiracy,</hi> viz. <hi>Barnevelt, Hager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betius, Grotius, Ledenbergius; to disband these new Souldiers; to purge the Cities of disaffected Magistrates, and to substitute better in their rooms:</hi> All which the Prince with incredible courage and speed effected, and that without the effusion of the least drop of bloud.

                  <q>That every good Christian must believe that he is by the grace of God, and satisfaction of our Lord and Redeemer Christ Jesus, predestinated to Salvation; that by the same grace of God he had received Faith, by which he firmly believes that his Salvation hath not any other foundation than the grace of God, and merits of our Lord Jesus Christ; that if it happen that he fall into grievous sins, he must firmly lean on this confidence, that God will not permit that he should persevere in sins, and that it will come to pass, that if he ask pardon, God would convert him through his mercy, call him to repentance, and make him persevere in faith to the end. He adds, that he had shewed this his Opinion to sundry Divines, and even to <hi>Olevian</hi> himself; by whom he was told, that he might acquiesce in that Doctrine, and that there was no need he should search
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40538:68"/>
deeper in the secrets of this mystery. Again, speaking of Remonstrants and Contraremonstrants, he saith, that he did not more incline to one Opinion than another.</q>
So that we may think that he had only some Political de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to drive on. What it was, and how much it failed him, I will not say; but go on to see, whether the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel do hold good betwixt the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi>

D. C.</hi> Lord Ambassador, <hi>is desired to acquaint</hi> (if he thought fit,) <hi>his Grace of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>that this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is like to be a difference, not in the English Colledge, but in the Synod.</hi> How well this may be accorded with the former Letter, is not for me to judge. Page 8, 'tis said that <hi>some of the Provincials did use</hi> Martinius <hi>very uncivilly. He is a man very learned and honest, sound in all the five Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as any man in the Synod, except the second; in which when the Canons come to be made, your Lordship will hear there will be more of his Opinion besides himself.</hi> Page 25, Dr. <hi>Balcan.</hi> gives us a relation of the <hi>Iudgement of the British Divines and others, concerning the second Article. The</hi> Bremenses <hi>are affirmed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of their Persons, to have delivered three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral judgements.</hi> Martinius <hi>his judgement was first read, who did stand in effect to the Tenents of the Remonstrants in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Article, he mainly overthrew the received distinction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction, and did determine that Christ did truely die for all and every man; that he was made a propitiation both for the godly and the wicked; and that by his death he did impetrate recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God for them all: at the latter end he condemned many things both in the Remonstrants and in the Contraremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants Opinion; but more in the Contraremonstrants.</hi> Issel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgius <hi>defended both the received distinction and restriction.</hi> Crocius <hi>propounded a middle way b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40538:69"/>
granting (which we also in our Colledge did,) that Christ by his death did merit some supernatural things for the wicked, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing belonging to the remission of sin, or reconciliation with God: and so indeed, for any thing I could perceive, his judgement was directly against that of</hi> Martinius, <hi>and in effect all one with that of</hi> Isselburgius. Finally, we are told page 26, that <hi>in the second Article there was not altogether so uniform a consent, both in regard of phrases and forms of speaking and in regard of some Propositions, as were in the first; yet certainly there was very great, more than could be expected from so great a number of learned men, in so hard and controverted an Article.</hi> So that whereas Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> counts it a reproach to the Synod, that there was so much difference about universal Redemption, Dr. <hi>Balcan.</hi> thinks it an honour there was no more. But not to leave this matter so much in the dark; If <hi>Martinius</hi> was for the Arminian equal indifferent universal Redemption of every one of mankind, I am well assured, that neither all the British Divines nor any one of them was of his mind: but indeed his Opinion and the Remonstrants Opinion, seem to be heavenly wide; as may be proved from his subscriptions to the Synodal Determinations about the Death of Christ, and mans Redemption by the Death, <hi>Acta Synodi pag.</hi> 356. for no man can think, that in those Determinations, the Opinion of the Remonstrants was not condemned. But if this be not thought proof sufficient, let the Reader be pleased to turn to <hi>Acta Synodi pag.</hi> 639, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the judgement of this <hi>Martinius</hi> is fully recorded. In the very entrance he professeth to follow <hi>Ambrose, Si Christus pro omnibus mortuus est, specialiter tamen pro nobis passus est. Pag.</hi> 643, 644. he rejects seventeen Errors, the far greater part of which are the Tenents of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants. As for <hi>Ludovicus Crocius,</hi> he hath in his <hi>Duodecas Dissertationum</hi> (provoked thereunto by the cavils of some) taken a great deal of pains to state this Question about the universality of Christ's Redemption; in the tenth dissertation, he explaineth the terms, and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecteth the extream Opinions; in the eleventh, he delivereth his own Opinion, in no fewer than nineteen Conclusions, in any of which, if the Remonstrants can find any lettice for their lips, much good may it do them. For my part, I wonder that Dr. <hi>Balcanqual</hi> should here write, <hi>that for any thing he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40538:70"/>
could perceive, the judgement of</hi> Crocius <hi>was directly contrary to that of</hi> Martinius. The judgements of both those Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are recorded about the second Article, and there is not the least contrariety betwixt them. Both hold uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Redemption in the sense laid down by Dr. <hi>Davenant,</hi> in his most excellent Dissertation <hi>de morte Christi:</hi> Neither of them maintain it in any other sense. Both of them heartily agreed and subscribed to the Canons of the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> made in the second Article, as did also our British Divines; who yet had received it in charge from King <hi>Iames,</hi> not to deny that Christ died for all and every man. Moreover, it is most manifest, that <hi>Crocius</hi> did in the Synod maintain the Universality of Christ's death, by a Letter written to him from one of his Colleagues from <hi>Brente,</hi> during the Session of the Synod <hi>Anno</hi> 1619, <hi>Feb.</hi> 25. For in that Letter, <hi>he hath thanks given him for maintaining the Universality of Christ's death; and is told, that his Opinion was approved by all to whom he had shewn it.</hi> Vide <hi>Crocii Disser. secundam de Peccato Originis,</hi> pag. 61, 62.</p>

                  <hi>The general Body of the Synod not being able to avoid the inconveniences which the Supralapsarian way brought with it, were generally intent on the Sublapsarian way: but on the other side, the Commissioners of the Churches of</hi> South-Holland <hi>thought it not necessary to determine which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, man</hi> faln <hi>or not</hi> faln, <hi>while he passed the Decrees of Election and Reprobation.

Doctor upbraids the Synod with Dissention, another praises God (as there was reason) for their Unity. Indeed if the difference betwixt Supra and Sublapsarians be calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considered, it will be found to be only in <hi>Apice Logico</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> speaks;) and to determine of Logical Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is not work proper for a Synod of Divines met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to settle the Peace of the Churches. I believe the Divines Assembled in this present Convocation, have as considerable differences among themselves about the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, as this comes to; nor is it to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we should all agree in <hi>minutiis Logicis aut Metaphysicis,</hi> any more than that we should be all of the same stature or complexion, as to the outward man. Mr. <hi>Hoard,</hi> so much made use of by our Quinquarticular Historian, plainly confesseth, <hi>there is no reason that the Supra and Sublapsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians should differ about circumstances, since they agree in the substance. Iunius</hi> thought the three Opinions about the object of Predestination were rather <hi>seemingly</hi> than <hi>really</hi> opposite. <hi>Piscator</hi> will not grant that they are opposite, but only different; and therefore, that all three may have place, he resolves the matter of Predestination into three Acts, The first is, <hi>the Decree of creating men to different ends</hi>; this must needs have for its object <hi>massam nondum conditam.</hi> The second Act is, <hi>the Decree of permitting Sin</hi>; and this must needs have for its object <hi>man created, but not yet corrupted.</hi> The third Act is, <hi>the Decree of Electing and Reprobating</hi>; and this must have for its object, <hi>man both created and corrupted.</hi> 'Tis besides my purpose to enquire, how much or how little is to be said against this way of reconciliation: but this I undertake to prove, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance betwixt the Supralapsarians and Sublapsarians is not so great, but that they both may and ought to look upon one another as Brethren, and walk in love, which is the bond of perfection and fulfilling of the Law: The more pity is it that they should so bitterly inveigh against each other, as it cannot be dissembled that sometimes, they do; but this must be imputed to that <gap reason="foreign">

Dr. <hi>Balcanqual</hi> saith, <hi>he could no more blame them for being angry, than he could a stone for descending to its center.</hi> I more wonder that <hi>Scultetus,</hi> a man of better temper, should so far forget himself; but he was transported through a misapprehension, that his reverend and dear Colleague was abused. I scarce ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it Christian in Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> to rake up and bring to remembrance the passionate speeches of men who have many years since given an account unto their Master, and never to mention the satisfaction they made to the men whom they had injured: For it is said, <hi>page</hi> 15, <hi>that they protested they had no hard opinion of</hi> Martinius <hi>or</hi> Crocius; <hi>but accounted them Learned, Religious, Orthodoxal, were sorry for what they had done, and would do so no more.</hi>

The Opinions of the Franciscans and Dominicans differ far more, than do the Opinions of the Supra and Sublapsarians. Nor is it so material to determine, whether truth lie on the side of the Supralapsarian or Sublapsarian, as whether the Dominican or Franciscan be in the right. The parallel (a Fanatick would say) had run better if it had been thus drawn, As both Franciscan and Dominican lay claim to the Canons of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> so both Arminian and Anti-Arminian lay claim to the seventeenth Article of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The holy Scriptures themselves are not so penned, but that men of contrary perswasions do lay claim to them; upon which score yet, none but a professed Papist or Infidel, will accuse them of insufficiency or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity: Particularly the Apostle makes use, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

Must the divinely inspired Scriptures be condemned? God forbid. Besides, how doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that the Supralapsarian Divines in or about <hi>Holland</hi> do pretend some title to the Conclusions of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> or that there hath been a bitter contention betwixt <hi>Voetius</hi> and <hi>Maresius</hi> about the sense of the Synod? <hi>Voetius</hi> indeed is a Supralapsarian; In his first Volume of <hi>Select Disputations</hi> p. 55, he layeth down the several moments of the decree of Reprobation: but <hi>p.</hi> 356, 357, professeth, he easily beareth those who are of a contrary or different judgement from him; provided, they do not rashly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Supralapsarian Opinion maintained by so many and great Divines; and confesseth, the Synod propounded the common opinion, concerning Election out of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but not so as to reject the ascending above the

The Reasons of the doubt were sundry; but the chief was, because in their credential Letters, they were charged to defend the cause of the Remonstrants: now it could not be, that they should be both Defendants and Judges in the same Cause. The answer to this was, that they were not so limited, but that in their private instructions they had leave to do otherwise if they thought good. But when the private instructions were read, all that could be found was but this, that they had commission to defend their Cause, or to labour at least for an accommodation, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of it: but that they had power to pronounce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisively, that did not appear. Hereupon it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that they could not be Members of the Synod in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40538:72"/>
this Cause (for in any other they might,) but only as <hi>Citati.</hi> Yet notwithstanding, that they might see the equity of the Synod, it was permitted them to keep their places, on these conditions: 1. If they would quit their Defence of the Cause. 2. If they would give no Advice or Counsel, either directly or indirectly, to the <hi>Citati</hi>; and by no means meddle with them in their Cause, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not liking these Conditions, they declared that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to leave their place of Judges, and to adjoyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the other Remonstrants: which they did. What in all this proceeding is unjust? what unworthy of a Synod?</p>

               <p>Page 66, the Synod is charged with <hi>being too favourable to the Supralapsarians, and particularly to</hi> Maccovius, <hi>who openly maintained, that God willed sin; that he ordained sin as sin; and that by no means he would have all men to be saved; that God doth propound his Word to Reprobates for no other end, than that they might be left without excuse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet was he only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed with a friendly admonition.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true, that some of these speeches, though not all, were charged on <hi>Maccovius:</hi> Nor could the Synod condemn them simply, unless they would also condemn St. <hi>Austin,</hi> who is known in his <hi>Euchir. cap.</hi> 29, to have delivered this maxime, <hi>Non aliquid sit nisi omnipotens fieri velit, vel sinendo ut fiat, vel ipse faciendo:</hi> Many Scripture-expressions of like import might be produced. But yet if <hi>Maccovius</hi> did use such expressions before persons not seen in these Controversies, he did ill, and was to be blamed; for all truths are not fit for all ears. Sufficient for the Synods vindication it is, that <hi>Maccovius</hi> was brought before the Synod upon a by-occasion; and that the business betwixt him and <hi>Lubbertus</hi> waas committed to the examination of some few Delegates, according to whose report he was dismissed.</p>

                  <hi>Because when the Synod had concluded in the condemnation of the Remonstrants Doctrine, they next proceeded to the destruction of their Persons; calling upom them to subscribe to the Acts of the Synod, and setting them a peremptory day for conforming to it: And when they saw, that would not do it, by their incensed importunity they procured a Proclamation from the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to banish them from their native Countrey, with their Wives and Children, and so compelling them to beg their bread, even in desolate places.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A very lamentable story<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Remonstrants should be banished and their Wives and Children, and that they should be compelled to beg their bread, and their begging be confined to desolate places! But what were the names of these Remonstrants, who were put to all this extremity? Where is this Proclamation of the States General recorded, that such an ignorant man as I am may come to the sight of it? Certainly whatever these Remonstrants had of Free-will, they had not much Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in them, or else they would never have made choice of <hi>desolate</hi> places to beg their bread in; places inhabited, and populous Cities, are the places that our English Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars resort to. The Histories that I meet with, relate of attempts and endeavours, that were used in order to an accommodation; and the Contraremonstrants easily grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the <hi>simple meer Arminian,</hi> might be continued, and cherished in the bosom of the Church, provided, that he would not disturb the peace of the Church: But the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants unhappily choosing <hi>Episcopius</hi> to write their <hi>Confessio Fidei,</hi> broached and vented so many Socinian Errors, that there was no possibility, without violating all rules of discipline, of taking them into Church-fellowship. That no severity was used against the Remonstrants pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently upon the concluding of the Synod, I am not able to say; It is not unlike, they might have a little of that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure meted out to them, which they had meted out unto others: But I am sure that <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> himself acknowledgeth, that <hi>Episcopius</hi> an Arminian, and somewhat more than an Arminian, was not long after he was put out of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors

place, suffered both at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> to enjoy a preferment honourable and gainful. Might the Non-conformists, who differ only in a point of Ceremony and Discipline, have so fair quarter from their Episcopal Brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Remonstrants had from the Contraremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants, they would not sure make such loud Complaints of Trouble and Persecution, as now they do.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> But first, What if some ignorant Writer, abused with a false report, or not well understanding the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Dutch</hi> with whom he conversed, did thus mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represent the grounds of the Arminians condemnation, is this any other <hi>cross</hi> (to borrow one witticism from our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian) than what hath befallen men as honest and famous as the Remonstrants? Was not our own Countrey-man <hi>Wickliff,</hi> who did write professedly against begging Friers, reported by his Adversaries to be a favourer of begging? If it could be proved, that the Contraremonstrants had set this Mr. <hi>Cross</hi> thus to traduce and calumniate the Remonstrants, it had been a soul crime in them; but that they did so, is not pretended. The whole blame therefore of this false report must be on our English Bishops, who would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Fellow of no Parts or Judgement into holy Orders, and license his History; and on the Author himself, who would venture to write the History of things that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not. But what if this <hi>Cross</hi> was of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants own making? It hath been usual for men, upon
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40538:74"/>
some accounts truly guilty, and deservedly blamed, to procure themselves to be accused of some other things that they were never guilty of, that so the World finding them abused in one point, might think them innocent in all. In the late Wars, I believe some Wags have framed stories against their own Party, and sent them up to <hi>London</hi> to be Printed, with no other design than this, to make the <hi>Diurnalists</hi> and <hi>Intelligencers</hi> ridiculous, and suspected even when they related truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If this <hi>Cross</hi> is so much to be blamed for his malice, why doth Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> imitate him, if not exceed him, in saying, <hi>that every man of reason knows that these blasphemies are the consequence and result of</hi> Calvin<hi>'s Doctrine</hi>? Were all those eminent Professors and learned Preachers, who in their Sermons and Lectures and printed Treatises, have maintained, that it doth not from <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrine fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that God is the Author of Sin, men of no reason? or were they so base, as to go about to maintain a thing against their knowledge? Certain I am, that they are not followers, but forsakers of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who positively maintain and teach, either that God is the Author of Sin, or that he created the far greater part of mankind only of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to damn them. That he again and again denied God to be the Author of Sin, no man will gainsay, that hath read either his <hi>Institutions,</hi> or his <hi>Answer to the Calumnies of a Knave,</hi> or his <hi>Discourse against the Libertines.</hi> As so creating men on purpose to damnthem, let the Reader but observe what he saith for himself, <hi>de aeterna Dei provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentia, Etsi quid toti generi humano futu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. What if a man should say, that some at least of the Remonstrants are guilty of these Blasphemies? They make God to be the Author of Concupiscence, and Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence is Sin; therefore they make God the Author of Sin. They also make God not to have decreed to any one that Grace, which alone can keep men out of Hell; therefore they make him to create mankind with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to damn the whole race. In the Calvinists me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, some are sure to be saved: but in the way of the Arminians, no man can be saved; all being left to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty

and indifferency of their own corrupt wills, which must necessarily ruine them at last.</p>
               <p>I will not justifie Mr. <hi>Cross</hi> in what he relates concerning the Remonstrants; but I will say this, that I can manifestly prove, that sundry who pretend the greatest zeal against making God the Author of Sin, do themselves make him the Author of Sin, or say he may be the Author of Sin. It is not unknown that Socinians deny God's prescience of the free actions of men. <hi>Si omnia futura Deus praesciret, opor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yea, and he wonders that <hi>Camero</hi> should think he had any fear, when this, so at least ill-sounding a Proposition, was delivered by him. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that some School-men had said so before him: Which may not be denied; but yet seeing <hi>actus sunt sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positorum,</hi> he will be as hard put to it, not to make God the Author of Sin, as any Calvinist.</p>
               <p>I instance thirdly in Mr. <hi>Th. Pierce,</hi> from whom thus I argue:
<q>
                     <l>God is the Cause of every Being, whether visible or invisible:</l>
                     <l>Therefore <hi>God is the Cause of Sin.</hi>

               <p>The Antecedent is an Article of our Creed. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent is proved; because Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> again and again as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts Sin to be positive. His beloved Author Dr. <hi>Iackson</hi>

                  </gap>s eighth Book of Commentaries, hopes to bring himself off from this argumentation, by limiting the Proposition, <hi>God made all things visible and invisible, to substances; which only
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40538:75"/>
are the immediate and direct effects and proper objects of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Accidents had their beginnings as appurtenances to their subjects, by resultance only.</hi> But I answer, that I suppose he is the first that ever said, that All accidents had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning by resultance; and the first that so limited this maxime to substances. For though it may be granted, that both creation and generation, strictly so called, are termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to substances; yet accidents are truly things, and must have a cause, a real cause: and doubtless the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did ascribe the production of all things, whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents or substances, unto God: and, in reason, he is as truly the cause of what is comproduced and concreated, as of what is produced and created. In <hi>page</hi> 35, this Dr. <hi>Iack.</hi> tells us, what emboldned Divines to assign unto sin only a privative being, <hi>viz.</hi> the maxime that <hi>Omne ens est bonum</hi>: but that he tells us, <hi>is meant only of a Metaphysical goodness.</hi> No Divines thought otherwise, but they were afraid to assign so much as a Metaphysical goodness to sin, which is simply evil: and such fear would have seised on Dr. <hi>Iackson</hi> also, had he but well weighed, what that is which goodness Metaphysical doth superadde to entity. But that he had never weighed; and yet talks confidently, in this whole Controversie, concerning the nature of sin, and the efficient of sin, as if his eyes had been blessed to see the things that scarce any saw before him. Book 10, pag. 3012, &amp;c. cap. 5, 6, <hi>he goes about to make Apologies for the harsh expressions of some good Writers, and well deserving of all Reformed Churches: Yea, and for the Errors of the</hi> Dominicans, <hi>or other Schoolmen, (more faulty than, as he saith,</hi> Zuinglius <hi>or his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, in this point.)

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40538:75"/>
to attribut such acts and decrees unto God as we do, and yet withal to deny, that we concludently make him the Author of Sin, doth not argue as great a measure of artificial foppery or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural infatuation, as it would of impiety, to resolve dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> in terminis terminantibus, <hi>that God is the Author of evil?</hi> But what is it that may make this Question allowed in any Academical Act? <hi>Why, it might be justly allowed, though the Answerer were furnished with no other ground besides that usually avouched distinction, between the act and obliquity of the act: especially if the distinction were applied unto the first sin of our first Parents. In that sin, the act and obliquity, are altogether as unseparably annexed, as rotundity is with a sphere; and to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine there should be one cause of the act, and another of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity of the act, would be as gross a solecism, as to assign any other cause of the rotundity of a sphere besides him that frames it.</hi> A discourse so loose, that I much wondered it could find any place in the writings of an Author so famed for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For every Fresh-man knows, that there is not the same relation betwixt the act and its obliquity, as there is between rotundity and a sphere; every Fresh-man knows, that there may be a sufficient ground of distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, betwixt things that are inseparably annexed; every Divine also knows, that the Calvinists do make man to be the cause, of the sinfulness of the act as well as of the act it self: all that they say is, that the first cause may af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ord that concourse to a sinful action, which is necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required to every action, and yet not be the cause of the sinfulness of the action. If Dr. <hi>Iackson</hi> think this impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, he should have told us, how God could concur to the good actions of his Saints, and not be the cause of the sinful imperfection which is inseparable from every action that doth not flow from a principle that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. I account he hath forsaken the Reformed Churches, who saith, that God gives any one, in this life, such a holiness as doth not fall short of the Law: That habitual holiness which falls short of the Law, must necessarily, when it is put forth, produce actions short of the Law; and so far as they fall short of the Law, they are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: Now I ask, is God the cause of my imperfect act of love to himself? If he be not, why do I either pray to him for it, or praise him for it? If he be the cause, then he
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40538:76"/>
is either the cause of that sinful obliquity necessarily clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to it, and making it need pardon; or else he may be the cause of the act, and not of the sinful obliquity that doth inseparably cleave to it. If Dr. <hi>Iackson</hi> affirm the latter, he contradicts his own Principle; If the former, he avoucheth that blasphemy which all good men abhor. Wherefore he might have done well to reserve the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse of Polygraphy for himself: <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> in this matter do not stand in need of it. As little need had <hi>Paraeus</hi> of his sorrow for entring into dispute with <hi>Becanus</hi>; for if ever man had the better, <hi>Paraeus</hi> had it that day. About the year 1604, <hi>Becanus</hi> at <hi>Mentz</hi> had a disputation, concerning God's being the Author of Sin; in which he expresly said, <hi>that the God of the Calvinists was the Devil</hi>: For this, among other things, <hi>Paraeus</hi> undertook him, and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarias</hi> and <hi>Malhusinus,</hi> and brought them to acknowledge, <hi>that whatever became of</hi> Calvin, <hi>it could not truly be said, that the Devil was the God of the Calvinists:</hi> What is victory, if this be not victory? when did innocence triumph, if not that day, which was <hi>Aug.</hi> 1, <hi>An.</hi> 1608.</p>

On which account, the Reader may be the less troubled, to find in the same page the Reverend and Religious <hi>Peter Moulin</hi> accused, as one that was feign to leave <hi>France,</hi> not for his zeal in Religion, but for pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticalness. Indeed I have rarely observed <hi>Episcopius,</hi> either to give a Contra-remonstrant his due praise, or not to give a Remonstrant more than his due. <hi>Vorstius,</hi> in his <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>Camero, is a man than whom he had never met with one more modest, and more studious of a good conscience:</hi> in his <hi>Theological institutions,</hi> he counts it not sufficient to vindicate the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Translation of <hi>Castalio</hi> from the censures of <hi>Albericus Gentilis</hi> and <hi>Thuanus,</hi> but he must also commend the <hi>faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and elegance of his French Translation</hi>; whereas Doctor <hi>Rivet,</hi> a more competent judge of the elegancy of a French Translation, assures us, <hi>that no French man can read it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out indignation and laughter, so foolish and ridiculous is it in many places.</hi>

Points, was the sole ground of all the penalties that were inflicted on them. All men, who are any way acquainted with the History of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, do know that the Remonstrants were not proceeded against meerly for erring in these five Points, but also for Socinianism and Scepticism, of which to this day they have never been able to purge themselves. Indeed the <hi>Holland</hi> Remonstrants are a Sect of men, that are not fitted for communion with any Christian Churches, except we will call the Assemblies of the furious Anabaptists or the blasphemous Socinians, by the name of Christian Churches. <hi>They can have no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with any Church, that is either idolatrous, or that maketh any opinion necessary which they judge not necessary, or that teacheth that the Magistrate may hinder and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Arnoldus Poelenbergius</hi> in that little piece of his, wherein he labours to prove, <hi>that the Remonstrants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with a safe conscience joyn in communion with the Contra-remonstrants,</hi> layeth the necessity of separation, not on the Heterodoxy of the Contra-remonstrants in the five Points, but on their tyranny in imposing Confessions to be subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and in going about to define what is necessary to be believed. <hi>Episcopius</hi> in an Epistle to <hi>Grotius,</hi> bearing date <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> 29, 1631, saith <hi>Quinquarticulanam litem tanti non facerem, nisi conjunctam sibi haberet eam, quae est de discretione necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum dogmatum a non necessariis, sive de mutua Christianorum tolerantia.

                  <hi>Their Doctrine</hi> (saith he) <hi>is impeached in these Points of no smaller crimes, than to be destructive of God's grace, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductory of Popery, tending unto spiritual pride, and to sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or rebellion in the Civil Government. Which Objections I shall here present, as I have done the Arguments of most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, which were excogitated and enforced against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions and determinations of the Synod in the said five Points: and that being done, I shall return such answers as are made unto them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here I cannot but observe, 1. That whereas he drew up the Charge of the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> against the <hi>Contra-remonstrants,</hi> and took no notice of any Answer that was or might be returned by the <hi>Contra-remonstants</hi>; yet now that the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> are to be impeached, he either finds or makes Answers for them: which is not fair in an Historian.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. That all the impeachment is not exhibited. For the Remonstrants are charged to overthrow the <hi>praesci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the simplicity, the immutability of God; yea, and all piety and Christian consolation.</hi> But it is wisdom to raise no more enemies than a man thinks he shall be able to contest with.

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40538:78"/>
which objection it is answered, that the Remonstrants speak as honourably of the grace of God as any other whatsoever; as may be proved by comparing the first branch of the fourth Article with that golden saying of</hi> S. Augustine, <hi>Sine gratia Dei praeveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente ut velimus, &amp; subsequente ne frustra velimus, ad pietatis opera nil valemus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> So much do all true Christians abhor whatever Doctrine doth derogate from the grace of God, that the greatest opposers of grace have found it necessary to speak honourably of it. <hi>Pelagius</hi> indeed in his first attempts, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much as mentioned the word grace; but he soon saw, his opinions so propounded would never take: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he began to use the word grace, but by it understood no more than Free-will, as appears by that known and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly quoted place of S. <hi>Aug. Serm.</hi> 11. <hi>de Verb. Apost. cap.</hi> 7, <hi>Disputantes contra gratiam pro libero arbitrio secerunt auribus piis &amp; Catholicis offensionem: coeperunt horreri, coeperunt ut certa pernicies devitari, coepit de illis dici quod contra gratiam dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarent: &amp; invenerunt ad revelandam istam invidiam tale com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum; non, inquit, contra gratiam Dei disputo quod liberum arbitrium defendo: videte acumen sed vitreum, quasi lucet vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, sed frangitur veritate:</hi> that is, God gave us our Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, and therefore whatever we do by the strength of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, is to be ascribed unto Grace. When this would not do, then he began to allow another Grace, that was commonly called <hi>Gratia legis aut doctrinae:</hi> allowing God not only to bestow on us Free-will, but also by his Law and Precepts to shew and discover unto us our duty. <hi>Aiunt ideo ista si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lit. cap.</hi> 2. adding also in other places, that they acknowledged a <hi>Grace of remission</hi> vouchsafed to all such as did unfeignedly turn themselves to him. Yea, he stuck not at last to anathematize any one that should say or think, that the grace of God was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, not only for every hour &amp; moment, but also for every one of our actions. Who would think that <hi>Pelagius</hi> were not now become as Orthodox as any of the Fathers of the Councel before whom he was summoned to appear? But the wretch was as Heterodox as ever; for by grace neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for every moment, and every act, he understands ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40538:78"/>
only that it is needful that we should keep in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory that our sins are pardoned, or that we should al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way have in our eye the example or Law of Christ. I list not further to prosecute the several states and steps of Pelagianism; Great art was used, as may be seen both in <hi>Vossius</hi> and <hi>Iansenius</hi> to refine the errour, that it might be the more easily swallowed down. What I have already no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted shews sufficiently, that men may in words acknowledge grace, and yet in works deny it, <hi>sacrificing to their own nets, and burning incense to their own drags.</hi> Whether the Remonstrants are not to be put into this number, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we compare and put together their writings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning converting grace. I grant that they in the third Article, and in the greatest part of the fourth, speak fairly concerning grace; but, Did they not in the <hi>Hague</hi> Conference deny <hi>the infusion of any habit or new vital principle</hi>? Did they not say, <hi>that the Spirit acted no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise upon the Will than by moral swasion?</hi> and that <hi>nothing was put into the will, or did properly inhere in the Will, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Liberty?</hi> That one clause, <hi>as for the manner of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of this Grace, it is not to be thought irresistible, doth</hi> (saith <hi>Paraeus</hi>) <hi>take away all that from grace, that was before given to it.</hi> Acta Synod. p. 311. &amp; p. 317. <hi>If the grace which causeth conver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ion be not irresistible, but resistible, such as may be by the will of man hindred or not hindred, all that in the third or fourth Article is attributed to grace is but an empty smoak of words, and those effects they speak of cannot be ascribed to the grace of God but indifferently and remotely, to the wills of men not resisting they must be ascribed specifically and neerly. If so, then all they so magnificently write of grace, will be either a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, or a cheat: It will be a cheat, or a falsity to say,</hi> 1. <hi>That man hath not faith from himself, and in the strength of his Free-will; for from himself he will have the specification of the operation of grace, because by not resisting grace, he hath distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished himself from others.</hi> 2. <hi>That he cannot of himself think, will, or do any good; for it is good, of a mans self well to spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie a resistible indifferent operation.</hi> 3. <hi>That God by his holy Spirit doth regenerate and renew us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for God by his Spirit shall only resistibly, indifferently and remotely, and therefore improperly; we our selves shall specifically, immediately, and properly regenerate and renew our selves.</hi> Many other things
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40538:79"/>
of this nature are by this learned Professor there urged, which the Remonstrants will never be able by all their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry to evade.</p>
               <p>This also will make good the other charge against the Remonstrants Doctrine, taken notice of by the Doctor <hi>page</hi> 73, viz. <hi>That it doth naturally encline a man to the sin of pride:</hi> For the removal of which he would offer something, but such a something as is next to nothing, <hi>viz.</hi> that</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That Doctrine must needs more cherish humane presumption, which puffeth men up with the certainty of their election, the infallibility of assisting and persisting grace, and the impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of falling from the attaining of that salvation which they have promised themselves; than that which leaves these Points uncertain, which puts a man to the continual necessity of calling upon God, and working out the way unto his salvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> For who will not reply to him, that in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-monstrant way there is more ground for prayer and for fear and trembling; since the Contra-remonstrants ascribe to God the working in us both to will and to do, which the Remonstrants cannot? The Remonstrants must needs, if they will not contradict themselves, affirm, that God doth, <hi>pari gradu &amp; modo,</hi> in the like degree and measure, will and work antecedently, the conversion of those who are converted and of those who are not converted. If so, what ground for fear, sith man can convert himself when he pleaseth, and restore the lost habits when he listeth? The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> one of the rarest examples of humility, did sure best know, what's most likely to quel and subdue high thoughts and proud imaginations: and what weapons doth he make use of to this end? Why two such interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, as must needs prick the bladder, with the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonstrant, but not with the Remonstrant. Let it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of a Calvinist, <hi>What hast thou, that thou hast not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived?</hi> He will answer, <hi>Nothing.</hi> Let it be enquired, <hi>Who made thee to differ?</hi> He will reply, <hi>The meer undeserved omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent grace of God.</hi> But a <hi>Grevincovius</hi> will say, <hi>He made himself to differ.</hi> But perhaps no Arminian else will say so:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40538:79"/>
Yes, Mr. <hi>Playser</hi> in his <hi>Appello Evangelium</hi> hath said so; and all Remonstrants must say so, that will not fly from their principles. To manifest which, I shall only English something out of the <hi>Declaratio sententiae Remonstrant. circa Articul. cap.</hi> 3, <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 21, <hi>If it be enquired, why this man is converted, and another not? We answer, this man is convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, because God converts him, not opposing any new contumacy; the other is not converted, because he doth oppose new contumacy. But you will enquire, why this man opposeth new contumacy, not the other? We answer, this man opposeth, because he will oppose; the other opposeth not, because he is moved by grace,</hi> ne velit opponere, <hi>to have no mind to oppose. If you enquire, whether he who opposeth not new contumacy, and by consequent is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, hath greater grace than he that opposeth, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is not converted? We answer, that antecedent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting grace may be equal; but the former hath co-operating, the latter hath not.</hi> Hence it is plain, that it is man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi> who makes <hi>sufficient</hi> grace to be <hi>effectual</hi>; and by necessary consequence, <hi>man</hi> doth make <hi>himself</hi> a <hi>penitent,</hi> a <hi>believer,</hi> a <hi>regenerate person:</hi> than which <hi>Pelagius</hi> himself could not write or speak, higher or more proudly.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To which the Answer is easie, Because the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans opinions do much tend to the exaltation of grace, and the subjection of carnal reason to Faith; so do not the Tenents of the Franciscans or Jesuits.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40538:80"/>
When as it is known, that a very great, if not the greatest part of the Lutherans, are as far from being Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthonians, or moderate, as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> is from being a Presbyterian or Puritan. But it seems, if men be never so violent for <hi>Ubiquity, Consubstantiation, Images,</hi> if they be but against <hi>Predestination,</hi> they shall pass for meek and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and Melancthonians.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may a little be questioned, Whether the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Lutherans be as far from relapsing to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as were those Lutherans who made the first se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from it? I know not how much there may be of truth in the talk that hath lately filled our ears, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Unions and accommodations betwixt the Lutheran and Roman Churches. It would be very strange if the Lutherans, having all this while been bred up among Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, should be as averse from Image-worship, as were the first Reformers.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="1">1.

Their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might hinder them from passing over this Bridge: forsake these dear Relations they could not, and yet if they did not forsake them, they could promise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves no good reception, or kind entertainment among the Pontificians. 2. The Remonstrants might therefore not turn Papists, because they were resolved to turn to a worse sort of Hereticks, <hi>viz.</hi> the Socinians. But did the Remonstrants strike in with the Socinians? Yes, that they did; as I will undertake to prove by as good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as can be expected in matter of fact.

<list>
                     <item>1. Before Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> ruled and governed, those who embraced the Opinions since called Arminian, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed out of the way to preferment; but who knows not that many of them turned Papists? <hi>Barret</hi> did so in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time: And the Heads of Houses in <hi>Cambridge</hi> complain in the before mentioned Letter, that they had found by experience, that Popery came in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them at the door of Arminianism, (so I may call it by a prolepsis.)</item>
                     <item>2. When Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> ruled and disposed of all Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal preferment, Arminians had no provocations from want or scorn, yet even then some of them turned Papists.</item>
                     <item>3. Since the breaking out of the late unhappy Civil Wars and Confusions, there hath a cup of trembling and astonishment gone round the three Nations, and Divines of all perswasions have been made to drink of it; all Ministers, by what names soever dignified, by what opinions soever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, have been made the filth and off-scouring of all things: but that scorn or want hath befallen any one meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for being a favourer of Arminianism, is more than I know, more than Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> can prove. Sure I am, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those Army-men, who gloried in nothing more, than in trampling all Law and Right under foot, were Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and he who was the only Divine that dared to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie that horrid fact, <hi>the murdering of the late King,</hi> is known to all to be a great stickler for <hi>Arminianism.</hi> But it were to be wished, that no Arminians had, during the late Troubles, forsaken the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and took sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary in the Synagogue of <hi>Rome.</hi> I was bred up with Mr. <hi>W. H.</hi> at <hi>Katherine-Hall</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who was looked upon by the whole Society, as a very studious, ingenious, hopeful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and was thereupon chosen Fellow before he was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Arts; but by acquaintance with some, he began highly to dote on the <hi>Common Prayer-book,</hi> and would leave good Sermons at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and walk over to <hi>Coton</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the might hear the Liturgy; withal he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40538:82"/>
fell to downright Popery, and is now, as they say, a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Priest. I would not have mentioned this story, but that it is notorious, I suppose, all <hi>Cambridge</hi> over. What shall we think of the late Bishop of <hi>Glocester?</hi> was not he called and reputed an Arminian? and did he not die a Son and Member of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> I confess, makes an Essay to clear him from Popery, but very unhappily: whilest he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove that he did not die a Papist, he makes him not a Christian for the former part of his life. These are the words used concerning him, <hi>pag.</hi> 637, <hi>No wonder if dying and dejected, he chose rather to depart in communion with the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>than to adhere to the Church of</hi> England, <hi>which he thought now decayed and dissolved (at least as to its visible order and polity,) if not quite destroyed: not that he owned (I hope) a communion, or conciliation with the Roman Church as Popish, but as far as it was Christian.</hi> If dying he was recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as Christian, then before he was at enmity with it as Christian; and if so, he was not a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian. I hope a man may adhere to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and yet depart in communion with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as Christian? In a word, there was not many years since a Book published, in which were contained the names of many of those who had lately revolted to Popery: Let Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> read over that Catalogue, and then tell me, whether it was not a strange piece of boldness to ask so confidently, Why none of those who are called Arminians, had in all these times turned Papists?</item>

                  <hi>Finally it is objected (but the objection rather concerneth the men than the doctrine) that the Arminians are a Faction, a turbulent and seditious Faction, so found in the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from their very first spawning.</hi> To this he answers, pag. 77, <hi>that there is nothing in the Doctrine of the Arminians (as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the five Points in difference) which can dispose the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of it to any such practices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I know not that any one hath in print affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Arminian Doctrine doth naturally lead men to Faction and Sedition; but if any one have affirmed

               <p>But the Doctor, contenting himself nakedly to affirm, that there is nothing in the Arminian Doctrines, which can dispose the Professors of it to seditious practices; tells us from some, that it is not so with the Doctrine of the other Party,</p>

                  <hi>By which mens actions are so ordered &amp; predetermined by the will of God, even to the taking up of a straw,</hi> ut nec plus boni nec minus mali, <hi>that it is neither in their power to do more good, or commit less evil than they do; and then according to that Doctrine, all treasons, murders, and seditions are to be excused, as unavoidable in them that commit the same,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There is, I remember, a very noted story out of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> concerning an Anonymous Libeller, who would needs father it upon the reverend and learned Dr. <hi>Carolus de Maets, that God hath decreed and determined, that all things should be done in that time, manner, place, and order, that in time they are done; and that according to this decree and divine determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a man cannot do more good or evil than he doth or omitteth:</hi> quite leaving out the explication that was used by the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Professor, <hi>viz. that in a divided sense, a man may do more good, and avoid more evil than he doth.</hi> Just so doth our Historian proceed, making the Calvinists to affirm that <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,</hi> which they affirm not but <hi>with a distinction. In sensu composito,</hi> a man cannot do more good than he doth, nor ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from more evil than he abstaineth from; but in a <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> sense he may. Which made our Divines of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> among the Heterodox assertions which they rejected, place this; <hi>Hominem non posse plus boni facere quam facit, nec plus mali omittere quam omittit: falsum hoc est &amp; absonum, sive de homine irregenito &amp; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mali intelligatur, sive etiam de renato &amp; gratia sanctificante
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40538:83"/>
suffulto.</hi> The learned <hi>Camero</hi> was charged by his angry Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary <hi>Tilenus,</hi> to hold, that man could not do more good than he doth, nor omit more evil than he omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. To this, what answereth he? <hi>Ego vero libens agnosco multa esse,</hi> &amp;c. (pag. <hi>mihi</hi> 704,) <hi>I willingly acknowledge, that there are many things, which uttered simply, do, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly, breed offence; which very things, if they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed conditionally, appear such, as that no man dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict them</hi>; e. c. <hi>If any one shall say, that</hi> Pharaoh <hi>could not let Israel go, he would offend the ears of all, if he add not, unless God soften the heart of the wicked man: but God hath not decreed to do that, therefore it shall not be, it cannot be, that</hi> Pharaoh <hi>let Israel go. Now his speech will offend no man, no not</hi> Tilenus <hi>himself; who doth not deny, but that on hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened persons there doth lie, and that by the decree of God, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of sinning.</hi> Nor can the Arminians (those of them who assert Divine praescience) tell how to extricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of the labyrinth, but by the help of this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>in sensu composito &amp; diviso</hi>: which is made use of by <hi>Curcellaeus,</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Limburgius</hi> from <hi>Amsterdam, Decemb.</hi> 13. 1653.</p>
               <p>To be short, there is no Doctrine that can more encline the heart to quietness, patience, contentedness, (all which are perfectly contrary to sedition and rebellion) than doth the <hi>Augustinian,</hi> or (if that must be the name) <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrine. For this being once firmly imprinted on our hearts, that all things come to pass according to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate counsel of God's will; that the worst of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are but the staff of his indignation, do fulfill the will of his purpose when they most cross and go against his legislative will, what place is there left for murmuring? what place for envie or revenge against second causes or instruments? It was not an Arminian, but a Calvinistical apprehension of God's providence about sin, which <hi>Ioseph</hi> had, when unto his Brethren, fearing lest after their Father's death their old unkindness should be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, he answered, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.19, 20, <hi>Fear not, for am I in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40538:83"/>
when he saith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.8, <hi>It was not you that sent me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This notwithstanding, Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> will quote some testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and authorities tending to prove, that Calvinism or doctrinal Puritanism, is destructive to all Civil Policy and Government. Some scraps he produceth from the old Lord <hi>Burley,</hi> from the Bishop of <hi>Oxford, Rochester, St. Davids,</hi> from Dr. <hi>Brooks,</hi> once Master of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge: But he is, I believe, afraid to come either to the pole or to the scale; either to weigh, or to number authorities with us. We'll undertake among English Protestant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Statesmen, to produce forty who deny Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism to have any tendency to Sedition, for one who hath laid any such thing to its charge. And 'tis a shrewd sign that the Doctor was hard put to it to find out Abettors for his Cause; else he would not have set <hi>Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> to bark against his Adversaries, which yet, to his no small shame, he doth, <hi>page</hi> 79, 80.

               <p>I had thought to have followed our <hi>Historian,</hi> and to have given some account of his <hi>second</hi> and <hi>third Part,</hi> in which he goes about to perswade us, that the Doctrine now called Arminianism, was and is the Doctrine of the Reformed Church of <hi>England:</hi> But this work is already done to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by <hi>Theophilus Churchman,</hi> in his <hi>Revi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40538:84"/>
need an Answer, or else already answered, I shall then yield the Cause. Till this be done, I shall not think, that that can be the Doctrine of the Church, which was contradicted by all or the major part of our learned Divines and Professors; or that the whole Church, or any lawful Authority in the Church, would impose it on her own Members, to recant her own Doctrine. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church is wont to enjoyn Recantation to those who contradict her Articles; why she should enjoyn the Recantation of Arminianism, if that be agreeable to her Articles, he had need have the wisdom of all the seven wise men that can shew a reason. I conclude, humbly beseeching all those who are entrusted with Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Authority, <hi>that they would not be so intent on Discipline, as to neglect Doctrine; that they would not let Pelagianism enter in, under pretence of opposing Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanism; that</hi> Calvin<hi>'s Institutions, and the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles, which a Convocation in</hi> Oxford <hi>joyned together, may not now be put asunder.</hi>

as the unquestionable Doctrine of our Church: Yea, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to find it acknowledged, <hi>that</hi> Adam <hi>by his Fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Image of the Devil, the Bondslave of Hell, and nothing else but a Lump of Sin; and that this so great and miserable a Plague, fell not only on him, but also on his Posterity and Children for ever.</hi> Hence I infer, that they are no Sons of our Church, who either quite deny Original Sin, or make it to be no Sin properly so called. I infer also secondly, that the story of which the Doctor is so proud, <hi>page</hi> 7, doth not represent the case in which God found fallen man. For the King of <hi>Lombard</hi> found in <hi>Lamistus</hi> both a power to lay hold on his Hunting-spear, and a willingness to save himself by it: but if man be the Image of the Devil, and nothing but a lump of Sin, he hath no power till it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, so much as to accept of Grace offered; nay, his carnal mind is enmity against all the Laws by which God would bring him to happiness. As for the Principle laid down, <hi>page</hi> 6, towards the end, <hi>that as were the Acts of God in their right production, so were they primitively in his intention,</hi> it is very unfitly expressed, and either the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it is only this, that as God did put forth his Acts in time so he purposed eternally to put them forth, or else it is most absurd and contrary to all Principles of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy and Theology.</p>

                  <item>1. <hi>That the Sacrament of the Altar is nothing but a piece of Bread.</hi> Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> makes mention of <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Wicket, and I my self have it, as it was reprinted at <hi>Oxford</hi> by <hi>Ioseph Barnes</hi> Prefaced by the Reverend <hi>Henry Iackson</hi> of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge; by the which any one may see, he speaks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently of the blessed Eucharist, and strongly confuteth Transubstantiation. It is there expresly said, <hi>the Bread consecrated is Christ's Body in figurative speech, which is hid to the understanding of Sinners.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That Priests have no more authority to minister Sacraments than Lay-men.</hi> This is a calumny, as Dr. <hi>Iames</hi> his Apology for <hi>Wickliff</hi> will manifest: Yet if he had maintained, that a Lay-man, or Woman, in case of necessity, may administer the Sacrament of Baptism, he had been in an error, but in an error common to him, with the Popish Church, and the Lutheran Church, and our own Church, till headed b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> King <hi>Iames</hi>; yea, had he held that a Lay-man, or woman, may administer the Lord's Supper, I hope the Doctor will not much swagger against him on that score, seeing the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of his Soul, <hi>Simon Episcopius,</hi> affirms as much as that comes to, making also the immortal <hi>Grotius</hi> his Vouchee for this opinion: Lo his words in his <hi>Answer to the sixty four Questions,</hi> page 39,
<q>It is not absolutely necessary, that the Administration of the Supper should be performed by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40538:85"/>
some Officer of the Church; and therefore because in Christ there is neither male nor female, it may in like manner be performed by all. Where that Order ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that some Officer should perform the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Order is to be kept for peace-sake, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Order. Where the Officer is not present, or cannot be present in the publick Assembly, it is lawful for any man, especially a meet man, to perform that Administration: For why should the Administration of the Lord's Supper be thought forbidden to them, unto whom it is allowed to speak and teach in the Assembly? But unto all men doth the Apostle permit to speak in the Church, because he does except women, though meet understanding women, that are married, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Husbands, as is manifest out of both Texts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34, 35. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. For Virgins and Widows the Apostle seemeth not to except, especially if endowed, with the gift of Prophecy from God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause unto them do not belong the reasons for which the Apostle would have women hold their peace in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, not to teach, but to be in silence. Although it is certain where men, especially meet, are present, that it is fit that they should be prefer'd to any kind of women whatever in teaching and administring. I add, where no men meet, but only women religious and godly, that there is no cause why they may not teach one another, and celebrate the Lord's Supper among themselves, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the precept of celebrating the remembrance of Christ's death, and of testifying our mutual communion, belongs not less to women than to men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.28. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily if we view the ancient custom of the Church, which <hi>Grotius</hi> hath alledged out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> we we cannot doubt but that the Administration of both Sacraments were granted to Laicks, and sometimes to women.</q>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>That all things ought to be common.</hi> This is a most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect calumny; <hi>Wickliff</hi> held no community, except that which hath nothing against it, but <hi>covetousness the root of all evil,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Iames</hi> hath manifested.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>That it is as lawful to Christen a Child in a Tub of Water at home, or in a Ditch by the way, as in a Font-stone in the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40538:86"/>
Churches.</hi> And what if <hi>Wickliff,</hi> at a time when the publick Administration of Baptism was defiled with most dreadful Superstition, did tell the People, that Baptism was not by God's Law tied to a <hi>Font-stone</hi> in the Church? would not the Doctor have told them as much had he lived in those dayes? yea, do not all say as much at this very day? For my part I heartily rejoyce in the usages of those Churches, that have Baptisteries placed in the Temple, so as the Administration of the Ordinance may be observed by all the Members of the Congregation. Nevertheless Antiquity used Tubs of Water, and Ditches, or Lakes, not Font-stones. Of the Apostolical times this will not be denied. For the two following Centuries it is manifest by <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> in his second Apology, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his third Chapter <hi>de Corona Militis,</hi> that it was custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary not to bring water to the Church, but to carry the Church to the Water. I would thank that Scholar that would from any undoubted Record of Antiquity shew me that Font-stones, placed near the Church door, came in before the fourth Century.</item>
                  <item>5. <hi>That it is as lawful at all times to confess unto a Lay-man as unto a Priest.</hi> Is not this a shrewd Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie? delivered long before <hi>Wickliff</hi> by Saint <hi>Iames</hi>; who not only allows, but enjoyns us to confess our faults one to another? Yet to say, that Confession unto a Lay-man, is to all intents and purposes as availe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as unto a Priest, is an Error, and never owned by <hi>Wickliff.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. <hi>That it is not necessary, or profitable, to have any Church, or Chappel to pray in, or to do any Divine Service in.</hi> A Church is not necessary to perform Divine Service in, that is certain: no, nor yet profitable, so as to commend our Services to God. But yet usually Temples are more convenient than any other places in our Parishes: and therefore we are to rejoyce, that they are continued to us, notwithstanding the fury of the late Wars; and to use them, making no question for conscience sake. <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff</hi> doubtless used to Pray and Preach in his Church at <hi>Lutterworth,</hi> neither thinking that his Church did sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Services, nor defile them: and of this belief am I. Never do I find it so much as mentioned or objected
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40538:86"/>
against <hi>Wickliff,</hi> that he performed Divine Service in any other than a Consecrated place.
<q>To <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Swinderby</hi> indeed I find it was objected,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vide</hi> Fox <hi>in</hi> Richard II.</note> that many times and oft he had come to a Desart Wood, cleped <hi>Derwalf</hi> Wood, and there in a Chappel not hallowed, but accursed Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds Hulk, presumed to sing, but rather to curse in contempt of the Keys.</q>
But he replies, that this was falsly put on him; saying, it was a Chappel where a Priest useth to sing certain dayes in the year with great solemnity.</item>
                  <item>7. <hi>That burying in Church-yards is unprofitable, and in vain. Wickliff</hi>'s own Body was buried in his Church-yard, after he had served God in his generation: Had he accounted it unprofitable to have such a burying place, why did he not take order with some of his Friends to have his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>case laid elsewhere? Were it not a custom received in our Church to bury in the Church, or Church-yard, I would never petition that it might be made a custom; knowing that from the beginning it was not so, either in the Jewish or Christian Church.</item>
                  <item>8. <hi>That Holy-days ordained and instituted by the Church (and taking in the Lord's day for one) are not to be observed and kept in reverence, in as much as all dayes are alike.</hi> The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis here is of the Doctor's own adding. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation represents the Wickliffists as distinguishing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Sundayes and Holy-dayes, Article 35. We may give a shrewd ghess at <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Opinion, by the Opinion of <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> which was as <hi>Bernard Luzenberg</hi> represents it, <hi>that we must cease from work no day but the Lord's day.</hi> To this the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Churches do stand to this very day; keeping some dayes indeed besides the Lord's day, but meerly as circumstances, not as parts of worship: and therefore so soon as Divine Service is over, allowing people to follow their work; yet granting no such allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the Lord's day, which they aver to be of Divine institution.</item>
                  <item>9. <hi>That it is sufficient, and enough to believe, though a man do no good works.</hi> This is but the Heresie of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> only maliciously represented by <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Adversaries; and it is at this day the stone that every Papist carries in his pocket, to throw at the heads of all Protestants whatsoever,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40538:87"/>
whether Calvinist or Lutheran. It were to be wished that some Lutherans had no more given occasion to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, than <hi>Wickliff</hi> did.</item>
                  <item>10. <hi>That no humane Laws, or Constitutions, do oblige a Christian.</hi> 'Tis added by the Convocation, <hi>but such as be in the Gospels, or</hi> Paul<hi>'s Epistles, or the New Testament.</hi> And why the Doctor omitted this addition, or restriction, no man can give a good reason. Such limitation doth take off all the offensiveness of the Universal negative; for there can be no good Law, or Constitution humane, but what is to be found either expresly, or implicitely in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The New Testament requires obedience to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, that are not contrary to the eternal Rule of Righteousness or some Divine positive institution, under the severest penalties, and from the most perfect motive.</item>
                  <item>11. <hi>That God never gave grace or knowledge to a great person, or rich man, and that they in no wise follow the same.</hi> This was indeed the opinion of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> with whose He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies <hi>Wickliff</hi> was never thought to be infected: that <hi>Wickliff</hi> ever held any such opinion, is neither true nor probable. He was so much favoured by the Nobility and Gentry of this Nation, who had great estates, and ever upon increase, that it cannot be thought he would ever broach a Tenent, that left none of them any hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Dr. <hi>George Abbot,</hi> afterwards Arch-Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> mentions in his Answer to Dr. <hi>Hill,</hi> a Manuscript he had seen of one <hi>Henry Knighton,</hi> a Canon of <hi>Leicester.</hi> That Manuscript is now published, with some others, by <hi>Cornelius Bee</hi>; the learned <hi>Selden</hi> having put a large Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the whole Book. From that Preface I collect, that <hi>Knighton</hi> was contemporary to <hi>Wickliff,</hi> and so was the more able to give us right information of him. He never chargeth <hi>Wickliff</hi> with denying grace or salvation to all rich men: Some such thing indeed he fathers upon <hi>William Swinderby</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> page 2646, but if he had indeed held any other impossibility of rich mens salvation than what is the clear result of our Saviours own speech, why was no such thing charged on him in the Process made against him by the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> or <hi>Hereford?</hi> Both which are related by Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> and have not one tittle of this import in them.</item>

               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:40538:87"/>All that I shall further add, is</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Wickliffists</hi> did maugre all the malice of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries increase. <hi>Knighton</hi> saith, <hi>page</hi> 2666, <hi>Secta illa maximo in honore illis diebus habebatur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that Sect in those dayes was in great honour; and so multiplied, that you would scarce see two in the way, but one of them was a Disciple of</hi> Wickliff.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That <hi>Wickliff</hi> laid the Foundation of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in <hi>England,</hi> as well as of that in <hi>Bohemia.</hi> By three means especially did he advance our Reformation in <hi>England,</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. By Translating the Scriptures into the English Tongue: by this means kindling in his Countrey-men a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to understand the last Will and Testament of their blessed Saviour. By him, saith <hi>Knighton,</hi> page 2644, <hi>the Gospel was made vulgar, and more open to Laicks and Women knowing how to read, than it was wont to be to the Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men very learned and well understanding.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. By asserting the due power of Kings in their own Kingdoms, against the Usurpations of the Popes of <hi>Rome.</hi> Of this the Pope was very sensible, and feelingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of it, in his Letter to the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and to King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, 1378, saying, <hi>Wickliff</hi> broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Errors of <hi>Marsilius</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> and of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dune</hi> of unworthy memory. The very same complaint did Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Twelfth make, in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth: A Copy of this Letter I have not seen; but Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi> had seen it, and any <hi>Oxford</hi> man may see it in the Book that Mr. <hi>Hare</hi> gave to the University. How much <hi>Marsilius</hi> had shaken the Pillars of the Papal Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is not unknown to Scholars: It were to be wished that his <hi>Defensor</hi> were in more of their hands. And <hi>Wickliff</hi> indeed trod in his steps, (or rather in the steps of <hi>William Ocham,</hi> his Senior in <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge;) for he strenuously asserted,
<q>That the Lordship of all Temporalities, both of Secular men and Religious, pertained to the King; for else he were not King of <hi>England,</hi> but of a very small part of it: and that the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully (in case of necessity) for its own defence, detain and keep back the Treasure of the Kingdom, that it be not carried away ro foreign and strange Nations, the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40538:88"/>
Pope himself demanding and requiring the same under pain of Censure, and by virtue of Obedience.</q>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. He corrected and curbed the exorbitance of the Episcopal power also: asserting, that the Order of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in its own nature and substance, receiveth no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of more or less; and yet notwithstanding, the power of inferiour Priests is in these dayes, upon due considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, restrained, and sometimes again in time of necessity enlarged. See his exposition on the Conclusions in Mr. <hi>Fox, Rich</hi> 2. <hi>page</hi> 567. One of his Articles condemned by the Councel of <hi>Constance</hi> was, <hi>that Hallowing of Churches, Confirmation of Children, the Sacrament of Orders, be reserved to the Pope and Bishops only for lucre.</hi> This notion was sucked in by all our <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and even by those Papists that were not wedded to the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>; as may be seen in the <hi>Institution of a Christian man,</hi> concerning the Sacrament of Orders. And that our first Reformers in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s dayes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on the same Principle, will appear undeniable by that which Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> hath Printed in his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> out of Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Manuscript.

Yea, the Bibles used in Churches from 1549, to 1577, were those of <hi>Tindal</hi>'s Translation; called also <hi>Coverdale</hi>'s, because he had made some corrections of <hi>Tindal</hi>'s.

               <p>Here the Doctor supposeth a Question to be asked, <hi>On whom, or on whose judgements the first Reformers relied in the weighty business</hi>? And answers it first negatively. <hi>They had no respect of</hi> Calvin, <hi>whose offered assistance they refused, when they went about it; of which he sensibly complains unto some of his Friends in one of his Epistles.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Here are three things affirmed, 1. That our first Reformers had no respect to <hi>Calvin.</hi> 2. That the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers refused his profered assistance. 3. That <hi>Calvin</hi> sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly complaineth of this in one of his Epistles. But the Historian is wiser than to tell us in what Epistle for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Calvin</hi> makes this complaint, or what was the name of that Friend to whom this Epistle was directed. Such a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence might have spoiled his whole design, and discredited his future proceedings; for it would have let his Reader understand, that he could confidently aver things, that were neither <hi>vera,</hi> nor <hi>verisimilia.</hi> Is any man so facil as to believe, that our first Reformers had no respect to <hi>Calvin?</hi> when as, among the different opinions concerning the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, they followed his, and sent for <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Paul Fagius</hi> (men that they might be sure he had influenced and would influence) to assist them in carrying on their work, and to defend them by their learning against all opposition. I will once more look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Epistles and Answers, that I may see what thoughts our first Reformers had of that now so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried man. One, and but one Epistle, I find written by <hi>Cranmer</hi> to <hi>Calvin,</hi> intimating his desire that learned and godly men, who excell others in learning and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, might meet in some safe place, where they might handle all the heads of Ecclesiastical Doctrine, and agree, not only as to the things themselves, but also as to words and forms of speaking. This his desire being signified, he intreateth <hi>Calvin</hi> that he and <hi>Melancthon</hi> and <hi>Bullinger</hi> would deliberate among themselves, how such a Synod might most commodiously be congregated: The Letter bears date <hi>March</hi> 20. 1542. <hi>Calvin</hi> from <hi>Geneva</hi> answers this Letter; approves the Arch-Bishops design of calling an Assembly of Divines; adds, that if there might be any use of him, he would not refuse to pass over ten Seas to further it, but hoped that his tenuity would effect that he might be spared; he would think he had done his part if he should accompany others with his Prayers. This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is not profering his service, and complaining that his serv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce when profered was refused. <hi>Calvin</hi> also did write to the Protector, the Duke of <hi>Somerset:</hi> that Letter was so kindly accepted, that he of his own accord offered
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40538:89"/>
to present another Letter, which <hi>Calvin</hi> sent to King <hi>Edward</hi> himself. But it may be this Letter to the King was not accepted. I answer, It was not only accepted by the King, but also pleased his whole Council. And <hi>Cranmer</hi> admonished <hi>Calvin,</hi> that he could not do any thing more profitable, than to write often to the King; as I find in a Letter to <hi>Farel</hi> from <hi>Calvin,</hi> dated <hi>Iune</hi> 15. 1557. <hi>Bucer</hi> at <hi>Cambridge</hi> undestood that <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Letters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed much with <hi>Somerset,</hi> and therefore intreats him, when he did write to him to admonish him, not to suffer the Churches to be left void of Preachers and so to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed. Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi> so much valued <hi>Calvin,</hi> that he did write to him, even when he was imprisoned; saluting him with the Compellation of <hi>Vir praestantissime,</hi> earnestly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let the Doctor now have leave to tell us, to whom or to what our Reformers had respect.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If this be true, that our Reformers had such an eye to the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confession, I infer, that seeing <hi>Calvin</hi> could, and did subscribe to the <hi>Augustan</hi> Confession, there is nothing in our Articles but what he might have subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to.

                  <hi>Fourthly, in reference to the Points disputed, they ascribed much to the Authority of</hi> Melancthon, (<hi>not undeservedly called the Phoenix of</hi> Germany,) <hi>whose assistance they earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whose coming over they expected, who was as graciously invited hither by King</hi> Edward, <hi>his coming laid aside on the fall of the Duke of</hi> Somerset; <hi>therefore since they could not have his company, they made use of his Writings for their direction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Of this passage I am not able to give such an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as I desire. Well I remember I have read, that <hi>Melancthon</hi> in an Epistle to <hi>Camerarius,</hi> mentions his being invited into <hi>England</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, about the year 1534, and the cause of his refusal to accept the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>some intelligence he had received, that the King had no great care of the affairs of the Church.</hi> That he was ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by King <hi>Edward,</hi> I can neither affirm nor deny, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s Epistles at hand. But when was it that this great Scholar's assistance was so earnestly desired? The fall of the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> is placed by Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> at the 22. of <hi>Ian.</hi> 1552, the sixth year of the King's Raign, but a few moneths before the King's own death. He had indeed two years before lost his Protectorship, and so as to that may be said to be fallen. Before either his fall as Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> or as Protector, <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> and <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> had been in <hi>England.</hi> Now both these Worthies I shall prove to be Calvinistical in the Points under debate. And certainly the sending for two Calvinists, is a better
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40538:90"/>
and stronger Argument, that our first Reformers had a respect to <hi>Calvin</hi> in drawing up the Articles of Faith, than the sending for one <hi>Melancthon</hi> is, that they had an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calvinistical project: especially if it be considered that <hi>Hierom Zanchy,</hi> a Calvinist if not more than a Calvinist, was also sent for over into <hi>England,</hi> and had come over to assist in carrying on the Reformation, if when he was just upon his journey, a call to another Church had not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him. Let me also ask, What Writings of <hi>Melancthon</hi> be they that our Reformers had for their Directory? The first Edition of <hi>Melancthon</hi>'s Common places, approved by <hi>Luther,</hi> was written as Calvinistically as to the matter of Predestination, as <hi>Calvin</hi> himself could desire. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s own Book against <hi>Pighius</hi> was approved by <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and indeed dedicated to him. If in any other writings he seems to contradict <hi>Calvin</hi> (he doth but seem) in these matters, it is to be imputed not to any contrariety in his own judgement, but to a contrariety in those mens tempers that he had to deal with: and there is even betwixt St. <hi>Iames</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> writing against contrary errors, such a seeming contrariety, as every man is not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile. Something there is in what <hi>Lampadius</hi> writes, in the continuation of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All other men whatever, I suppose, think he <hi>hath spoken reproachfully</hi> of both those Reformers, in sundry of his Books; and in the passage before us, he speaks not over respectfully concerning either of them: and I believe vilely wrongs both, and <hi>Cranmer</hi> too; For where doth it appear that the Arch-Bishop thought either <hi>Luther</hi> because of his <hi>fiery spirit,</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> because of his <hi>busie humour</hi> unfit to be employed in the Reformation of this Church? Our Church was not reformed to any great purpose till <hi>Luther</hi> was in his grave; for he died the 8<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1546, not a month after King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, whose decease is placed by <hi>Iohn Speed</hi> 28 <hi>Ian.</hi> 1546. How far Reformation was advanced by that King, may be collected from his <hi>Will</hi> signed <hi>Decemb.</hi> 30. 1546, in which Masses, multitudes of Masses, are appointed to be said for his Soul. Indeed Mr. <hi>I. Fox</hi> acquaints us from A. <hi>Cranmer,</hi> that <hi>the King the</hi> August <hi>before he died, declared his purpose to abolish all Masses, and in stead of them to set up the Communion.</hi> Had he lived and performed that resolution, and had <hi>Luther</hi> lived to hear of the Performance of it, yet might not <hi>Cranmer</hi> perhaps have accounted it adviseable to keep any correspondence with him, because he had written against his Soveraign more bitterly than was meet, and had repented of that repentance which he sometime ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed for his bitterness.

               <p>Is there any one else that the Doctor thinks the first Reformers attributed much unto?

But, I hope, the Doctor thinks the Protector did intend to propagate some other Doctrine, than what was countenanced in the Writings of <hi>Erasmus</hi>; Why else did he go to fight against the <hi>Scots,</hi> which War was unlawful on the Principles of <hi>Erasmus?</hi> If the Protector warred against his conscience, yet, I trow, the Articles were not drawn up against the minds of those that form'd the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>The Ministers of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> in the most cursed Book of the <hi>Knowledge of one God,</hi> number him among their Ancestors: and <hi>Socinus</hi> himself in his Epistles saith of him, that he was, not undeservedly, suspected by the Trinitarians of Arianism; and of the Antitrinitarians, reckoned among those who somewhat darkly renounced the Trinity.</q>

I wish men would either not at all dispute for the amplitude of Redeeming grace, or else bring more apposite and concluding testimonies and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities than any that the Doctor hath here brought.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Doctor more advantaged by any thing that he alledgeth out of the <hi>Institution of a Christian Man</hi>; for if the Reformation in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths time were looked on as a

standard, (which it is not by any Protestant;) yet is there not a tittle in all the five particulars gathered by him, <hi>Par.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 21, 22, that hath so much as a face of opposition to any opinion of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s concerning Predestination. Had the Authors of that part of the <hi>Institution</hi> put the Pen, after they had made it, into <hi>Calvin</hi>'s own hand, he would not have dashed out any one period or expression in it.</p>
               <p>Many and just exceptions might be taken against sundry passages relating to the Composers, and composition, of the first and second Book of <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and the Book of <hi>Homilies</hi> of King <hi>Edward, pag.</hi> 23, 24. But being <hi>aprosdionysous</hi> to our main Controversie, let them pass.</p>
               <p>Nor will I wrestle with the <hi>Historian</hi> concerning any thing he saith about the Composers of the <hi>Articles,</hi> or the <hi>Articles</hi> themselves, or the authority they carry in respect of the making, or how they are to be understood in respect of the meaning, from <hi>pag.</hi> 25. to <hi>pag.</hi> 33. Though if I should wrestle, I were sure to lay him on his back.</p>
               <p>I will also submit to every Rule by him laid down, for the interpreting of the Article concerning Predestination, <hi>pag.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p>Let this be agreed on, 1. That that only is the Doctrine of our Church, which is laid down expresly in our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, or by good consequence may be thence deduced. 2. That if any phrase occur, about which there is any doubt, that be taken for the meaning, that shall be found agreeable to the mind of those who first composed, or were authorized to review the Articles, or were familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with such, and may be presumed to know their meaning, or to have received their notions from them. 3. Let this also be taken for granted, that none are to believe, or think themselves elect, but those who find in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a faith working by love: or that none can take unto themselves the comfort of being given to the Son by the Father's decree, but only those who are come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and that no ones reprobation can be known by himself, or another in any ordinary way, unless by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning some such sin as is alway accompanied with final unbelief and impenitence; (such is only the sin against the holy Ghost.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:40538:94"/>But the thing to be enquired, is, Whether God's purpose to save out of fallen man all that believe and persevere in believing, be his whole decree of Predestination? and his purpose to condemn all who continue in unbelief, the whole of his Reprobation? So say the Remonstrants. If our Church acknowledge no other decree of Election or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation but this, Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> then hath got the day: But if the Church, besides this general purpose, do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a decree, to give to a certain number of persons grace and glory, and a decree, to leave others in that sin and misery that they brought on themselves by the fall, then he loseth the day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But do the Remonstrants acknowledge no other Election and Reprobation besides these?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Sometimes they do not; and then, all their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction notwithstanding, no one man may be saved: but sometimes they are in a better mood, and give us notice of another Election, according to which some shall certainly be saved. This their decree is terminated to singular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but it is nothing else but God's purpose to save S. <hi>Iames,</hi> or S. <hi>Clement</hi> (for example,) whom he eternally foresaw persevering in faith unfeigned to the end of their lives. This latter decree they speak of but rarely; (what our thoughts are of it, will be seen by and by:) Nor doth it honour Divine election at all; for when they are closely examined, they say, the designation of S. <hi>Iames</hi> to salvation, was founded on the foresight of a faith, not which he attained unto by virtue of any grace prepared for him by Divine election, but which he attained unto by the good use of his own Free-will. Never do I find them, or any that follow them, acknowledge an Election of the Son of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> or any other person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto Faith, or unto any other part of Holiness. Other Questions there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Calvinist and Anticalvinist, besides the Question of Election; but such as are reduceable to it, or at least such, about which they would easily agree, could they but agree in this. I for my part would only ask that angry man, who calls me <hi>Manichee, Blasphemer,</hi> &amp;c. Why did <hi>Iames</hi> believe? why did he persevere? why was he ordained to eternal life? If in answering these, he fly to a special discrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting love and mercy, then will I never look on him as an
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40538:94"/>
Adversary: But if he shall say, the cause of all is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to <hi>Iames</hi> his own using of such sufficient means as were vouchsafed to <hi>Iudas</hi> as well as to him, then must I needs think, that he taketh from God to give to man; I must also needs think, that he shapeth his Notion of the Divine decree and grace, neither according to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor according to the Doctrine of the Fathers who wrote against <hi>Pelagius,</hi> nor according to the English Church.</p>
               <p>As to our <hi>English Church,</hi> thus runs her <hi>Article,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Doctor,</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Predestination to life, is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly ordered by his Council, secret unto us, to deliver from curse and damnation, those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as vessels made to honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Furthermore, we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they be generally set forth to us in holy Scripture; and in our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of God, that is to be followed which we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly declared to us in the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One would think that the many words used in this Article, were sufficient to determine what kind of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination the Church meaneth; For, 1. If she had meant nothing but God's purpose to save all Believers, it had been but bringing some one Scripture, in which eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life is promised to Believers, and all had been done. Nay, what needed any Article at all concerning Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Election, when we had one before concerning Justification; which according to this Notion very little differs from Election? God's Justification considered as an internal immanent act in himself, was nothing but his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to justifie fallen man believing in Christ. How much Mr. <hi>Playfer</hi> is gravelled with this Argument, may be seen <hi>App. Evan. pag.</hi> 360. 2.
<q>If Election be nothing but God's purpose to save Believers; why is it said, that as many as are endued with so excellent a benefit of God, be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to God's purpose; by his Spirit working in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40538:95"/>
due season, they through grace obey, and they walk reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously; and at length, by God's mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity?</q>
The benefit that any man hath by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in this way, is but to know, that if he believe he shall be saved. And are all that know so much, called, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, made to live righteously, and saved? We know they are not.
<q>Again, it is said, that the godly consideration of Election in Christ, is of unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ.</q>
But in the Doctor's way, Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is comfortable to those who feel nothing of the Spirit; for the promise is to them, that if they believe they shall be saved: and other promise the godly man hath not; he may the next hour lose all his holiness, and what certainty hath he then of salvation?
<q>It is also said, that for curious and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal persons, to have alway before them the sentence of God's Predestination, is a most dangerous downfal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Devil doth thrust them into desperation, or into wretchlesness of living.</q>
But now for any men to have the Doctor's Election, or sentence of Predestination alway be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, is no way dangerous, or apt to beget either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair or wretchlesness. We cannot advise carnal persons to a more profitable and pertinent object of meditation. In a word, the very calling of Election by the name of <hi>Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> is enough to determine what kind of Election is meant: The Doctor's Election is a <hi>Postdestination</hi>; for it then only makes men ordained to eternal life, when having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all temptations, they are possessed of it.</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This may perhaps be true of some <hi>Sublapsarians</hi>; of all I am sure it is not. The Sublapsarians I converse with, say, that if we respect God's nature and perfection, he doth, by one most simple act and at once, decree all things; but if respect be had to the things decreed, some priority and posteriority hath place. They also say, that the Controversie betwixt them and the Arminians, is not concerning the order of the Divine decrees, (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every considerable Author hath framed with some variety.) Would the Remonstrants but acknowledge, that God did by his decree ordain men to Faith, as well as to eternal life, they would permit them to abound in their own sense, Whether he did first ordain to the means, or to the end? Christ is by all Sublapsarians, that I ever heard of, made the meritorious cause of our Salvation; but they say, he is not the impulsive cause, why one rather than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other is chosen to Eternal life, any more than he was the cause of sending himself into the World. Whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Mediator did in God's decree precede the consideration of Salvation to be obtained by him; or the Salvation appointed to the Elect precede the consideration of the Mediator? is a thing disputed among the Calvinists themselves.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This is a great truth, that Election cannot be of all; a General election being <hi>oppositum in apposito:</hi> But the Doctor would have merited much of the Arminians, if he had shewn us what Election they acknowledge, which is not of all. <hi>Arminius</hi> makes four Decrees, 1. The Decree to send Christ to Redeem mankind. 2. The Decree to give Eternal life to Believers. 3. The Decree to give Grace and Strength sufficient to Believe. 4. The Decree to give Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to those particular Persons whom he foresaw would Believe, and persevere in the Faith. The three first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all, or at least all that hear of Christ. As for the fourth, methinks it is not worth the name of a Decree, nor
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40538:96"/>
beseeming the Divine Wisdom; for if our King foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who would come in and acknowledge their Rebellion, should decree that <hi>all comers in,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>should be pardoned</hi>; would it be suitable to Royal Wisdom to make another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, to <hi>pardon those whom he foresaw would come in,</hi> &amp;c? Besides, this fourth Decree can be of no use or efficacy to any man in this life: it conferred no more benefit to <hi>David</hi> than to <hi>Saul,</hi> to <hi>Abel</hi> than to <hi>Cain</hi>; for this Decree suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth perseverance in Faith to the last breath, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the other world.

judgement of our Martyrs and Confessors: <hi>viz.</hi> that in this life we can have no certainty of our predestination unto life.</p>
               <p>Against this, thus I argue: If a man may certainly know that he believes in Christ, he may know certainly that he is predestinated unto eternal life. But the antecedent is true, <hi>ergo</hi> so is the consequent.</p>
               <p>I prove my <hi>major,</hi> Because every one that believes, is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternal life. Which enunciation, if any one shall deny, I prove it, first, by the saying of Mr. <hi>Latimer,</hi> quoted with applause by the Doctor, <hi>If thou believest in him, then art thou written in the Book of life, and shalt be saved:</hi> which connexion were not good, if there were any man, a Believer, whose name were not found in the Book of life, or not saved. I prove it, because Faith is called, <hi>the Faith of God's Elect, Tit.</hi> 1.1. I prove it finally, because it is said, that <hi>as many as were ordained to eternal life believed, Acts</hi> 13.48. Why is it said, as many as were ordained to eternal life believed, if any could believe but those who are ordained to eternal life? But there is a place not to be eluded, <hi>Whom he calleth, those he justifieth; and whom be justifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th, those he also glorifieth:</hi> Whoever are called according to the purpose of his will, are justified and glorified.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>minor,</hi> that A man may certainly know he hath saith, methinks no Christian should doubt it. We should not so earnestly be pres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to try, whether we be in the faith, if we could not know, whether we be so or no. Are there not some effects that are proper to saving faith? If there be, why may not he who feels them in himself, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thence that he hath faith?</p>
               <p>As for our first Reformers, so far were they from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Election is not knowable, that some of them pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Faith in an Assurance of a mans Election and Christ's dying for him. If I prove this, I shall prove <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> that they were for personal absolute Election. Of others I shall prove, that they have in terms express owned <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Predestination, or some such Doctrine as is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily connexed with it. Secondly, I shall answer every Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony that Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> brings to prove, that the absolute Decrees were decryed by any of our Martyrs, and pass to the other Points.</p>

The second object is not so large as the first, nor the third so large as the second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Catechumen</hi> is as well taught to number himself among the Elect people of God, as among mankind. Who are these chosen of God? Surely they are the Elect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the foreknowledge of God the Father; and to such is the Sanctification of the Spirit here limited. So that if any one be chosen, he is sanctified; and if he be sanctified, he is chosen; and every one who comes for Confirmation, is taught to profess himself one of those whom the Spirit Sanctifieth, and God Elected. I dare not direct every Baptized person so to say: But by this we may see, what the opinion of the Composers of the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy was.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Catechism</hi> appointed by King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be taught by all Schoolmasters, <hi>fol.</hi> 38, it is said, <hi>To the furnishing of this Commonweal belong all they, as many as do truly fear, honour, and call upon God, wholly applying their mind to holy and godly living; and all those, that putting all their hope and trust in him, do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly look for the Bliss of everlasting life. But as many as are in this faith stedfast, were forechosen, predestinate, and appointed out to everlasting life, before the world was made: Witness whereof they have within their hearts, the Spirit of Christ, the Author, earnest un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but those whom he so fore-ordained to everlasting life. Yet there is more, <hi>fol.</hi> 39, <hi>The first, principal, and most perfect cause, of our justifying and salvation, is the goodness and love of God, whereby he chose us for his before he made the world.</hi> Now the Arminian election is not sure the most perfect cause of our justifying and salvation; nor is it God's chusing of us to be his before he made the world. And let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that it is said, that after that he hath chosen us for his, he granteth us to be called by the preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, when the spirit of the Lord is poured into us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our next task is to look into the sentiments of our Martyrs and Confessors; such as lost their lives, or left their Countrey, or were deprived of their Liberty or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnities and Preserments, for bearing witness to the Doctrine that was established by all Authority, Ecclesiastical and Civil, among us. Our first Martyr in order of time was <hi>Iohn Rogers</hi>; our first in order of Dignity, were <hi>Cranmer</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Bishops. I have not met with any writings of either of these, in which they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly declared their judgments in the Points under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: yet we will see what may be at least guessed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their mind.</p>
               <p>For Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> I find he was the Convert of <hi>William Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> and <hi>Miles Coverdale,</hi> and that he joyned with them in making that Translation, which now goes by the name of <hi>Matthews</hi> Translation: and what opinions that Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth favour, I leave it to indifferent persons to judge. I find him also among those worthy Persons, who subscribed a Declaration sent abroad <hi>May</hi> 8. 1554. all whose names are to be seen in Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> his third Volume, <hi>pag.</hi> 102, of the <hi>London</hi> Edition, 1631. (which Edition I shall still follow, having not the last Edition by me.) The purport of that I eclaration, is to shew Reasons why they will not otherwise <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ead by all, who would understand the spirit of our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs aright. The fourth branch of that Declaration, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Justif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40538:98"/>
of Merits, of the Necessity of Auricular Confession, and Satisfaction to God-wards.</hi> If they disallowed the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistical Doctrine of Free-will, whose Doctrine did they allow but the Doctrine of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> who in this matter perfectly agreed, (<hi>Luther</hi>'s high flown expression being abated.) All that I shall more observe concerning this Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> is 1. That he was a Non-conformist even to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, (his zeal out-running knowledge, unless he had some reasons proper to those times;) for he never went other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than with a round Cap, and would not agree to use the Attire proper to the Order of Priesthood, unless the Popish Priests might be enjoyned to wear upon their sleeves a Chalice with an Host. 2. That he was very zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to put to death the two Hereticks condemned by Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and burnt 1550, 1551. A familiar Friend of his came to him, and desired him <hi>to make use of his interest with</hi> Cranmer, <hi>that they might not be put to death, or if they were put to death, that they might not be burnt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that kind of death seemed not so agreeable to Evangelical meekness.</hi> He answered, <hi>that the punishment of burning men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live was not so tormenting, but mild enough.</hi> His Friend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, with a great ardor of spirit, holding his right hand, and striking his own against it, <hi>Go too, perhaps it will come to pass, that your selves may have your hands full of so mild burning.</hi> And he was indeed (as I before suggested) the first that tasted of the <hi>Marian</hi> Meekness.</p>
               <p>A. B. <hi>Cranmer</hi> must needs be supposed to have a great stroke in the framing of the Articles of Religion agreed on 1552. So must Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> also; for though <hi>Cranmer</hi> was Metropolitan in Title, yet <hi>Ridley</hi> seems to be the greater Stickler of the two, especially in the matter of Rites and Ceremonies. He forced <hi>Hooper</hi> to be Canonically Ordained, against his inclination, against the King's Letter, and the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Letter, the one bearing date <hi>Iuly</hi> 23. 1550, the other <hi>August</hi> 5. Yea, so violent was he, that he threatned or caused to be threatned, death to <hi>Hooper,</hi> if he persisted in refusal. <hi>Haec Theologomachia sic tandem exiit vincentibus Episcopis:</hi> Hooperus <hi>vel ad palinodiam, vel ad eas conditiones adactus est, ut semel saltem in concio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne publica se ostenderet populo, more caeterorum Episcoporum insulatus.

I say, I doubt there was somewhat of a pique, because I find that the same <hi>Ridley</hi> did ordain <hi>Iohn Bradford</hi> a Deacon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of those Canonical Rites that were then in use, as appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments, pag.</hi> 280. But <hi>Ridley</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his fault, and God forgave him, and so must man too. In the Letter in which this acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made, he also accquaints <hi>Hooper,</hi> that <hi>he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by his works, which he had superficially seen, that they throughly agreed, and wholly consented in those things, which are the grounds and substantial points of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, against which the world so furiously raged in those days.</hi> By which works, in all probability, he means some Trearises <hi>Hooper</hi> composed against Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are exemplified in <hi>Fox</hi> his Latine <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary.</hi> Certain it is, that <hi>Ridley</hi> could not approve all Doctrines in <hi>Hooper</hi>'s works, unless he disappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved one Article of our Religion: For <hi>Hooper</hi> in his <hi>Commentary</hi> on the <hi>Creed,</hi> doth most expresly declare against the local descent of Christ into Hell; which is asserted as a truth grounded on Scripture in the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Religion. And as certain is it, that <hi>Ridley</hi> could not joyn with him, if he condemned the absolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Election, (I shall shew hereafter that he did not,) or determining grace in conversion. The Article of Election, I have already both transcribed and argued from; let us now see what may be collected from the Articles of Free-will and Grace, which I will present as they were Printed by <hi>Iohn Day,</hi> with the King's Authority, 1553.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40538:99"/>
The words of the former are these, <hi>We have no power to do good works, pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ, preventing us that we may have a good will, and working in us when we have that will.</hi> Of the latter these, <hi>The Grace of Christ, or the holy Ghost by him given, doth take away the stony heart, and giveth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> heart of flesh: And although those that have no will to good things, he maketh them to will; and those that would evil things, he maketh them not to will the same; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless he enforceth not the will: And therefore no man when he sinneth can excuse himself, as not worthy to be blamed or condemned, by alledging that he sinneth unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, or by compulsion.</hi> If this be not <hi>Calvinism</hi> and <hi>Anti-arminianism,</hi> I know not what is. All power to good works, pleasant and acceptable to God, without grace preventing and co-operating, is denied to us. Grace also is said to take away the stony heart, and give an heart of flesh; to make us to will (not only able to will) good things. And when it comes to be explained, what it doth not, it is only said, it enforceth not: and sinners are only said, not to act by compulsion, which may well consist with some necessity. This is the summ of what the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists alledge, when charged to destroy Free-will. But now the Arminians say, there is no liberty, where no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference; and that the grace of God leaves a man indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, to turn or not to turn. I shall conclude what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Bishop <hi>Ridley,</hi> with those words of his farewel, <hi>pag.</hi> 506, <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monum. The Church had holy and wholesom Homilies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It had in matters of controversie Articles so pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and framed after the holy Scripture, and grounded upon the true understanding of God's word, that in short time, if they had been universally received, they should have been able to have set in Christ's Church much concord and unity in Christ's true Religion, and to have expelled many false Errors and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, wherewith this Church, alas, was almost overgone.</hi> He here approves all the Articles, and therefore the three before-mentioned, as agreeable to God's Word.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Cranmer,</hi> we have him not only owning all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Religion set out by King <hi>Edward,</hi> but also offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (if <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> might be joyned to him, with four or five more) to maintain that it was more pure, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40538:100"/>
to God's Word, than any that had been used in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for an hundred years. This had been a most foolish challenge indeed, if he had not known full well, that <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Martyr</hi> and he, jumped in their judgements about all the Articles, and particularly that of Predestination: With Heterodoxy in which, he might well expect to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; for <hi>Iames Lambert</hi> had been apposed in that point in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths Reign; and our Martyrs in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, were frequently twitted with fatality, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God the Author of Sin, destroying Free-will, and what not?</p>
               <p>The next Martyr I shall instance in, is Mr. <hi>Philpot,</hi> to whom Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> refers his Friend for satisfaction in the matter of Election. What he did write about Election, I do not find; but I find enough to make me confident, that if he had written any thing about it, he would have shewed himself sufficiently Calvinistical. For in his fifth Examination, he took occasion to ask his Popish Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, <hi>Which of them all was able to Answer</hi> Calvin<hi>'s Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which is Minister of</hi> Geneva? To which Dr. <hi>Saverson</hi> replies, with lye and all, <hi>A godly Minister indeed of receipt of Cut-purses, and Runnagate Traytors. And of late, I can tell you, there is such contention fallen between him and his own Sects, that he was feign to flee the Town, about Predestination. I tell you truth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or I came by</hi> Geneva <hi>hither</hi> At which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny <hi>Philpot</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s zeal was stirred, as appears by his words; <hi>I am sure you blaspheme that godly man, and that godly Church where he is Minister. As it is your Churches condition, when you cannot answer men by learning, to oppress them with blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and false reports; for in the matter of Predestination, he is in none other opinion than all the Doctors of the Church be, agreeing to the Scriptures.</hi> If this be not full and home, what is? The profound Disputant, and blessed Martyr, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his life, avows Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrine of Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to be agreeable to the ancient Doctors, and Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: And how could a Doctrine be more amply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended?</p>
               <p>His Friend Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> will say as much for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine it self, though not taking notice of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> as delivering it in his <hi>Institutions.</hi> There is a Letter of his concerning Election to two of his Friends, <hi>N. S. R. C.</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:40538:100"/>
recorded <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi> 352. Who the persons were, notified by these four letters, <hi>N. S. R. C.</hi> I have no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but suppose that <hi>N. S.</hi> was one <hi>Skelthrop,</hi> who held conditional Election, and Free-will, but by the pains Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> and others took with him, was reclaimed. After this Epistle of Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi>'s, Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> adds some Notes appertaining to the matter of Election; which Notes do not in the least contradict any one tittle in Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> but more largely explain what he touched but briefly. But Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> saith,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Dr. <hi>H.</hi> page 42.</head>
               <p>Fox <hi>his</hi> Notes <hi>corrupt the Text,</hi> and that <hi>Bradford</hi>'s <hi>Notion of Predestination, is plainly cross to that of the Calvinistical Party.</hi> Let us see whether there be any such crossness or no. <hi>Bradford</hi> (saith he) <hi>believeth that Faith is the work and gift of God, given to none other than the Children of God: Who are they? Those whom God the Father, before the beginning of the World, hath Predestinated in Christ unto Eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Is this Election cross to that of the Calvinists? Do not they say, against the Arminians, that Faith flows from Election as a fruit of it, and that it is commensurate with Election; so as none believe, but those who are elected? It not this the very offensive Notion of Election, against which the Remonstrants make such outcries?
<q>The Letter further adds; that though the Election be first in God, yet to us it is last opened.</q>
But the Doctors Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is last in God, as well as last opened to us. Let the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> proceed in his Letter:
<q>By the light of the Spirit, a man may see this Faith not given to all men, but to such as are born of God, predestinate before the World was made, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the purpose and good will of God: which will, we may not call into disputation, but in trembling and fear submit our selves to it, as to that which can will none otherwise, than that which is holy, right and good; how far so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever otherwise it may seem to the judgement of reason, which must needs be beaten down to be more careful for God's glory than man's salvation, which dependeth only thereon, as all God's Children full well see.</q>
Lo here, he
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40538:101"/>
speaks of a Predestination in which there is an unsearchable depth, of an Election about which, if reason not assisted by revelation should pass judgement, there would seem to be in it something of injustice. Whereas the Arminian Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, making God to predestinate men to life, upon the foresight that they would believe, and to pass by others, upon a foresight they would not believe, hath nothing of a depth in it, but is as easily accounted for, as any other act of God's providence whatsoever. I said before, that I conceived one of those, unto whom this Letter is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, was by it rectified in his judgement touching Election, and the use of Free-will which he had made a condition of that Election: at least I am sure, one <hi>Skelthrop</hi> was made to see the light in this particular. Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> takes notice of the change wrought in him, and praises God for it, in a Letter to <hi>Careless,</hi> page 336.
<q>Not doubting but that he would be so heedy in his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, that his old Acquaintance may ever thereby think themselves astray.</q>
In the same Letter he salutes in Christ, <hi>True</hi> and his Followers, hoping that God had his time for them also. Now this <hi>True</hi> was a man differing from <hi>Careless</hi> in the point of Election, as doth most manifestly appear by the Examination of <hi>Careless,</hi> related by the Doctor, <hi>page</hi> 15, 16, <hi>Part</hi> 3. He thought as the Popish Clergie did, that we be elect in respect of our good works. But Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> hoped he would come off from that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But I think he did not, but still continued to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Free-will. And the Protestant cause was not credited by him; for he plaid such a prank, as any inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Heathen would have been ashamed of; his Keeper shewing him more favour than he deserved, he ran away from him, and brought him into great danger.
<q>Thus you may see (sayes <hi>Careless</hi>) the fruits of our Free-will-men, that make so much boast of their own strength; but that house which is not builded surely upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable rock, will not long stand against the boiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous winds and storms, that blow so strongly in these dayes of Trouble.</q>
This is the only Sufferer I know of, that held conditional Election; and surely his carriage was not so commendable, that we should envy him unto our Adversaries. But whereas the <hi>Doctor</hi> thinks, that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40538:101"/>
                  <hi>the strong confidence which</hi> Careless <hi>had of his own salvation, and of the final perseverance of all those who are the chosen Members of Christ's Church, was a thought of his own, unto which the Doctrine of the Church gave no countenance:</hi> It will appear, that this was no singular opinion of his, but a kindly derivation from the <hi>Article</hi> of Religion, concerning <hi>Predestination unto Life:</hi> and it seems to be that which he had learned from holy <hi>Bradford,</hi> who in a <hi>Letter</hi> to Mistress <hi>M. H.</hi> under great heaviness and sorrow, teacheth her,
<q>That we should use all God's benefits to confirm our faith of this, that God is our God and Father, and to assure us, that he loveth us as our Father in Christ, and that God requireth this faith, and fatherly perswasion of his fatherly goodness, as his chiefest service. Adding, that no suggestion of Satan, grounded upon our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, frailty, and many evils, should make us doubt of God's savour in Christ; and that obedience giveth us not to be God's children, but to be God's children gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth obedience. And finally, that as certain as God is Almighty, as certain as God is merciful, as certain as God is true, as certain as Jesus Christ was crucified, is risen, and sitteth at the right hand of the Father, as certain as this is God's Commandment, <hi>I am the Lord thy God</hi>; so certain she ought to be, that God was her Father, <hi>pag.</hi> 327, 328.</q>
To another Gentlewoman, <hi>page</hi> 330, thus he writes,
<q>If he had not chosen you (as most certainly he hath,) he would not have so called you; he would never have justified you; he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have so exercised your faith with temptations as he hath done, and doth: if (I say,) he had not chosen you. If he have chosen you (as doubtless, Dear heart, he hath in Christ;) for in you I have seen his earnest, and before me and to me they could not deny it, I know both where and when; if, I say, he hath chosen you, then neither can you, nor ever shall perish.</q>
And in the same <hi>Letter, page</hi> 331, he sayes,
<q>Your thankfulness and worthiness are fruits and effects of your Election, they are no causes. If once you had a hope in the Lord (as you doubtless had it,) though now you feel it not, yet shall you feel it again; for the anger of the Lord lasteth but a moment, his mercy endureth for
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40538:102"/>
ever.</q>
                  <q>In another <hi>Letter, page</hi> 349, the same blessed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr sayes, that One man which is regenerate, well may be called alwayes just, and alwayes sinful: just in respect of God's seed, and his regeneration; sinful in respect of Satan's seed, and his first birth. Betwixt these two men there is continual conflict, and war most deadly: the flesh and old man, by reason of his birth that is perfect, doth often, for a time, prevail against the new man, being but a child in comparison; and that in such sort, as not only other, but even the Children of God themselves, think they be nothing else but old, and that the spirit and seed of God is lost and gone away: where yet notwithstanding, the truth is otherwise, the spirit and seed of God appearing again, and dispelling away the clouds which cover the Sun of God's seed from shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as the clouds in the air do the corporal Sun.</q>
Many things to like purpose follow in that <hi>Letter,</hi> by all which, and by several Treatises in the printed Works of Mr. <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> it sufficiently appears, that he favoured the Doctrine of absolute Predestination. And let any man judge, whether he thought the term of a man's life to be moveable or no, by some passages in his Examination, <hi>page</hi> 286.
<q>As for my death (my Lord) there are twelve hours in the day (as I know,) so with the Lord my time is appointed, and when it shall be his good time, then shall I depart hence; but in the mean season I am safe enough, though all the People had sworn my death.</q>
                  <hi>Page</hi> 291, he desires them <q>to proceed on in God's name, he looked for that which God appointed them to do.</q>
Upon which the Chancellor lets fall these words;
<q>This Fellow is in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Heresie of Fate and necessity, as though all things were so tied together, that of meer necessity all must come to pass.</q>
What replies <hi>Bradford</hi>?
<q>Things are not by fortune to God at any time, though to man they seem so sometimes. I speak but as the Apostle said, Lord, See how <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, are gathered together against thy Christ, to do that which thy hand and counsel hath before ordained for them to do.</q>

               <p>Consider we next the judgement of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> and <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> who, though Foreigners, had a great hand
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40538:102"/>
in the English Reformation. As to <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> methinks there should be no question made of his judgment. In his <hi>Commentary</hi> on the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in his <hi>Common places,</hi> he hath gone as high in the matter of God's decree, as ever <hi>Calvin</hi> did. But the <hi>Doctor</hi> tells us, that</p>

            <div type="part">

               <p>
                  <hi>Its more than probable that</hi> Peter Martyr, <hi>was not</hi> Peter Martyr, <hi>whilst he lived in</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If he would prove it but probable, he must prove that it hath seemed so to all, or to the most, or to the wisest, or to the most famous among those that are wise; which I despair of ever seeing him prove, so far am I from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he will prove more than this. The <hi>London</hi> Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Common places</hi> is not now in many mens hands; yet it is to be found in <hi>England</hi> and elsewhere: and never did any one that was a possessor of it, so much as adventure to affirm, that in that Edition, any thing was delivered concerning Predestination, that was in the least contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or seemingly contrary, to what we find in the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more commonly used. This answer the <hi>Doctor</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was somewhat diffident of, and therefore did not give it until he had before made way by disparaging <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> as one</p>
            </div>

               <p>Of whom <hi>there was little use made in advising, and much less in directing any thing which concerned the Articles; and who having no authority in Church or State, could not be considered as a Master-builder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Is the Doctor of the Chair of no authority in Church or State? I had thought that in matters Divine, both Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical and Political Persons had been wont to give much to his authority. Arch-Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> it is most certain made much use of him; keeping him at his own house, at his first coming over into <hi>England,</hi> that he might have the more frequent and free converse with him. And if Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shor <hi>Ridley</hi> was first converted to be a Protestant by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Bertram</hi>; yet it will not be denied, that he owed
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40538:103"/>
his confirmation to discourse with <hi>Peter Martyr.</hi> As for the Convocation 1552, he might be, for ought I know, a member of it: Doubtless he was one of the eight ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the King to make reformation of the Laws Ecclesiastical, and yet was there no use made of him in directing?</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Bucer,</hi> the <hi>Doctor</hi> would bear us in hand, that we have no reason to reckon him ours in the Points under debate, because</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Dr. <hi>H.</hi> pag. 109.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>He well approved our first Liturgie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Of which reason it will be then time enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, when it shall be shewed, that that Liturgy had any thing in it that favoured conditional Election, and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able converting Grace, and total and final Apostasie. But,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Dr. <hi>H.</hi> page 110.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is also affirmed, that he, among some other Protestants, assented in the point of falling from Grace to the opinion of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>in the Diet at</hi> Ratisbone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 'Tis indeed so affirmed by Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> (and, that I know of, by none else,) that <hi>Bucer</hi> did at the Diet of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbon,</hi> consent with some other Protestants, to the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Saints falling from Grace: but <hi>Zanchy</hi> tells us quite another tale, that <hi>Bucer</hi> hath in the <hi>Relation of the Conference at Ratisbon,</hi> laid down that which makes strongly for the certain perseverance of the Saints. If Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> had expected belief, he should have answered those alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and brought others that might evince the possibility of the true Saints apostasie. This may be sufficient to prove, that he was not <hi>against us:</hi> that he was <hi>for us, Zanchy</hi>'s quotations out of him will scarce suffer any one to doubt; but we will see whether we can find out any other evidence. First, whilst he was a Papist, he had his conversation among the Dominicans, from whom it is likely he got nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Jesuits notion of respective Decrees, and frustrable grace. The Star that brought him out of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, was <hi>Luther</hi>'s Book <hi>de servo Arbitrio</hi>; by which Star
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40538:103"/>
it is not like that he was lead to Pelagianism, or Semipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianism, or any other Doctrine that so advanceth the liberty of man's will, as sacrilegiously to rob the grace of God of its due force and power in converting of a Sinner.
What Doctrine he preached or delivered in the Schools, whilst in <hi>England,</hi> may be collected from the barbarous malice of his Romish Adversaries appointing his dead bones to be taken out of the grave and committed to the fire; for Dr. <hi>Watson</hi> in his Sermon in St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, chargeth <hi>Bucer</hi> to have defended <q>that perillous Doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fatal and absolute necessity of Predestination, and that he had set it out in such wise, as to leave no choice at all in such things: as who should say, It skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not what a man purposed of any matter, since he had not the power to determine otherwise than the matter should come to pass: the which was the peculiar opinion of them that made God the Author of Evil; bringing men through this perswasion into such a careless security of their everlasting eternity, that in the mean season it made no matter, either towards salvation, or towards damnation, what a man did in this life.</q>
And because it may be replied, that he speaks this to disgrace and disparage Protestants in general, let us therefore hear what Dr. <hi>Perne</hi> in his Sermon sayes concerning <hi>Bucer.</hi> In it we are told, <q>that he held opinion, that God was the Author and well-spring, not only of good, but also of evil; and that whatsoever was of that sort flowed from him, as from the head-spring and maker thereof: ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that <hi>Bucer</hi> upheld this Doctrine to be sincere; howbeit, for offending divers mens consciences, he durst not put it into mens heads.</q>
And in his sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, this is laid to his charge, as a Doctrine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by him, <hi>Omnia fato &amp; absoluta necessitate fieri. Vid.</hi> Mr. <hi>Fox, page</hi> 770, 772. I know the good man's soul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred the things in these particulars charged upon him; nor did Dr. <hi>Perne</hi> stick to acknowledge, that he wronged him against his own conscience: yet seeing these Popish Agents can scarce be supposed so mad and furious, as to charge things upon him without any colour, we may and must suppose that <hi>Bucer</hi> did, if not in his publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations yet in his private discourses, let the University
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40538:104"/>
know, that his judgment did not differ from <hi>Calvin</hi>'s, in the matter of God's decrees and concurrence unto the sinful actions of men. But if so,</p>

            <div type="part">

                  <hi>Dr. H.</hi> pag. 109.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why then does</hi> Calvin <hi>himself blame</hi> Bucer, <hi>for being Author and approver of such moderate courses, as the fiery temper of the</hi> Calvinists <hi>could by no means like?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, that <hi>Bucer,</hi> by his very best Friends, had been charged at <hi>Zurick, Anno</hi> 1533, for speaking too doubtfully in the Doctrine of the Sacrament, through a desire to appease <hi>Luther:</hi> He, then, and there, made such an Apology for himself as was accepted. If at his coming over into <hi>England,</hi> he fell into the same fault, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> did but the part of a Christian, to admonish him.
<q>But certainly <hi>Calvin</hi> had high and honourable thoughts of him while he lived, and after his death tells <hi>Viret,</hi> that he found his heart torn in pieces as oft as he remembred, how manifold a loss the Church of God sustained by his departure.</q>
And so we leave <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Martyr,</hi> with the <hi>Elogium</hi> deservedly bestowed upon them by Dr. <hi>Iackson, The two judicious Commentators,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is also worth while to enquire after the many worthy Divines, who to save their lives, and yet keep that faith and conscience which they had professed in the dayes of King <hi>Edward,</hi> did fly beyond Sea. We find some differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences among them, relating to <hi>Discipline</hi> and Ceremonies; an account whereof is given us in the troubles of <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> Had they not all been of one mind in matters of <hi>Doctrine</hi> relating to the Decrees, Grace, and Perseverance, their difference had not been concealed. It had been easie for the party that sided with <hi>Calvin</hi> in these points, to have crushed the <hi>Anticalvinistical</hi> party, if any such there had been; but there is not the least ground to think there was any such. Those English Divines who sojourned at <hi>Geneva</hi> made a <hi>Translation</hi> of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and marginal Annotations upon it sufficiently Calvinistical. This was published <hi>Anno</hi> 1560, and the Authors of it were so little conscious to themselves of having delivered any Doctrine con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rary to that which was received and allowed in King
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40538:104"/>
                  <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, that they adventured to dedicate their Work to the incomparable Princess Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> no favourer of Foreign Doctrine. She accepted the Dedication, suffered the Book and the Annotations to pass among her People, without any censure here. So much entertainment and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause did it meet with, that some who have been curious to search into the number of its Editions, say, that by the Queens own Printers, it was printed above thirty times. I am not ignorant that King <hi>Iames</hi> highly censured this Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation and the marginal Annotations, in the <hi>Hampton</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: the Translation he calls the worst that ever he saw; some of the Notes he calls very partial, untrue, seditious, and savouring too much of dangerous and traiterous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits: instancing in the Note on <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.19, and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.16. (which censure a Jesuit takes as if spoken of the Translation used at <hi>Geneva</hi> it self.) But the Annotations on both these places are satisfied for by Bishop <hi>Morton, page</hi> 104, of a Book written by him, to shew the Romanists Doctrine of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and Aequivocation. As for Arianism charged on these Annotations by Dr <hi>H.</hi> they are acquitted by the learned Letter of Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have all this while said nothing of Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi> and Bishop <hi>Latimer,</hi> out of whose Writings the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath transcribed so much. And truly the things transcribed out of them are so impertinent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it would be no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard to my <hi>Reader</hi> if I should wholly pass them over in si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Yet I will not; but first shall say something of the men, secondly of their writings. <hi>Latimer</hi> was once a very hot Papist, as himself acknowledgeth against himself. Being converted from Popery, he was as zealous for the Reformed Religion; boldly reproving the sins of all, whether Rulers or Ruled. In his Sermons he used a style, which perhaps was then accounted elegant; but would now be judged ridiculous, at least unbeseeming the Pulpit. <hi>Hooper</hi> I look upon as one that feared the Lord from his youth; for he chose from his youth to leave <hi>Oxford,</hi> that he might not ensnare his conscience. Beyond the Seas he fell into acquiantance with the learned <hi>Henry Bullinger</hi>; and returned not into <hi>England</hi> till the Reign of King <hi>Edward:</hi> when he gained more love from the Laicks, than Clergy, being a stiff Non-conformist. Hand in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40538:105"/>
drawing up the Articles of Religion he had none, one of them being diametrically opposite to his declared judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet because he was very great, both for piety and learning, as his writings evidently shew, therefore his judgment is not to be sleighted. And if Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> have proved, or any one else can prove, that he and <hi>Latimer</hi> held the opinions afterwards called Arminian; I will grant that those opinions were not by the Protestant Church in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time adjudged intolerable. Whether they held them or no? must be considered. First, I yield that they both asserted Universal Redemption. This being granted, the <hi>Doctor</hi> dare say, that</p>

                  <hi>He,</hi> (Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> he means,) <hi>will not be confident in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, there can be any room for such an absolute Decree of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, antecedaneous and precedent to the death of Christ, as his great Masters in the School of</hi> Calvin <hi>have been pleased to teach him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi>'s mind is best known to himself, so are his great Masters in the School of <hi>Calvin,</hi> if he ever had any such; but this I am confident of, that <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Decree of Reprobation may be maintained, and yet Universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption not denied. <hi>Monsieur Amyrald,</hi> as great a Scholar as this last age hath afforded, hath in a whole Book de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <hi>Calvin</hi>'s absolute Decree against Mr. <hi>Hoard</hi>; yet the same <hi>Amyrald</hi> most strenuously defends Universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.

               <p>Hooper <hi>in his Preface to the ten Commandments,</hi> saith,
<q>We must not extenuate Original Sin, nor make God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Evil; nor yet say, that God hath written fatal Laws, with the Stoicks, and in the necessity of destiny violently pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth one by the hair into Heaven, and thrusteth the other head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into Hell.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> All this is just according to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s method. No Calvinists say, that God's Decree offereth violence to Man's Will, or pulleth a man into Heaven. Only they say, that Electing love makes men willing, and that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is an effect of Election.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Why so teach the Calvinists too, that our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not to be known, but by our knowledge of our interest in Christ.

               <p>Perhaps the <hi>Doctor</hi> will find more against Calvinistical Reprobation; or if he do not, he must be concluded to have beaten the Air. First we must hear what he makes Calvinistical Reprobation to be. 'Tis that, he saith,</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If it be so, then I am sure I never was in any School of <hi>Calvin</hi>; for I never heard or read of any such Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: nay, I never read of any person whatsoever, that asserted such a Reprobation. Sundry famous Schoolmen, quoted by Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> in his fifth Disputation <hi>de Reprobatione,</hi> were of opinion, that <hi>if God had decreed even innocent creatures to eternal damnation, he had decreed nothing unworthy of himself</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they seem to have but too much countenance for this bold and audacious Tenent from a passage of St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s, in his 16. <hi>cap. de Praedestinatione &amp; Gratia:</hi> But the Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists (as many as I have met with) say, that as God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver actually damned any man but for sin, so he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to damn any but for sin. All that they say is but this, that Whereas <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were both alike cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the fall, and both alike apt by nature to abuse and reject grace, the reason why God determined effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to cure the corruption of <hi>Peter</hi> and not of <hi>Iudas,</hi> was the meer good pleasure of his will. The Calvinists are not engaged to say, that God reprobates any man who was not worthy to be reprobated. All that their opinion obligeth them to, is but this, Not to make sin the cause of preterition or non-election, comparatively considered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And against such preterition there is nothing in the Prayers of <hi>our Church,</hi> nothing in <hi>Latimer,</hi> nothing in <hi>Hooper,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in <hi>Cranmer,</hi> nothing in the whole <hi>Tenth Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s second <hi>Part.</hi> And it is a wonder, that so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient a Divine should trouble himself in so many pages to do execution upon a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40538:106"/>
God designed it unto, man still remains unconverted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different either to turn himself or not turn himself unto God?</hi> If converting Grace do leave a man thus indifferent, they say, that Conversion is rather to be ascribed to man than God; and that <hi>Paul</hi> made himself to differ from other Persecutors, and not God. But they never say, that God forceth or offereth violence unto the natural faculty of the will, or destroyeth any liberty that is essential to it. If any violence be offered, it is only unto corrupt lusts, and sinful inclinations; in which, I hope, I may have fair liberty to say, that the freedom of mans will doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. Let but any one fairly and impartially state this Question, by drawing Propositions concerning it out of the Writings before mentioned, and he will find nothing in <hi>Hooper</hi> or <hi>Latimer</hi> contradictory. The tenth Article of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s he will find perfectly to express the mind of the Calvinists. And so I might dismiss this matter, had not the <hi>Doctor</hi> thought meet <hi>page</hi> 67, as also in another Writing, to smite at us with a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> or something like a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> grounded upon the omitting of this Article in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time. <hi>Either this Article did favour Calvinism, or it did not:</hi> If it did not, <hi>why do the Calvinists alledge it</hi>? If it did, <hi>why is it in our latter Editions of the Articles left out</hi>? We have learnt from Logick, that such <hi>Dilemma's</hi> are not to be used, which may be inverted or retorted upon those that make them; and such is the present <hi>Dilemma,</hi> apparently, notoriously such. For thus I argue, <hi>Either this Article is Anti-calvinistical, or it is not:</hi> If it be not, <hi>why doth the</hi> Doctor <hi>produce it as such</hi>? If it be, <hi>why did our Reformers in Queen</hi> Elizabeth<hi>'s time</hi> (who were, as he would fain perswade us, Anticalvinistical) <hi>leave it out</hi>? He must either answer for himself, or not expect that we should answer for our selves: which yet we could easily do, did any Law of Disputation require it of us; for this might be the reason of the omission, because there was nothing in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s tenth Article, but what doth naturally and lineally descend from our present seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Article.</p>
               <p>I will follow the <hi>Doctor</hi> whither he leads me, when I have first admonisht my <hi>Reader,</hi> not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40538:107"/>
                  <hi>Works done before the grace of Christ do not make men meet to receive grace.</hi> For it will be found agreeable unto Scripture, that Works done before Conversion, may leave in the Soul a material disposition, or a passive prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to receive grace: no preparation can be wrought by them that deserves grace, none from which grace necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily flows; but yet such may be wrought, as from which a man may be denominated more meet, and more likely, to receive the undeserved love of God, than if he wanted it. Just as we say in Natural Philosophy, that though the rational soul do not emerge out of the organization of the matter, but is immediately inspired by God; yet an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical matter, is a more prepared subject to receive such a soul, than a matter not organized.</p>
               <p>I promised, after I had laid down this caution, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Doctor,</hi> and so I will, to his <hi>Twelfth Chapter.</hi> But in it I shall not need to stay long with him; for it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spent in laying down the Doctrine of Free-will, as it was agreed upon in the Popish Convocation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1543. Wherefore though there be nothing in the Article of Free-will there delivered, but what a Calvinist (allowing him but a favourable interpretation) may subscribe to; yet the Doctrine of the Reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> must not be measured by the decisions of that Popish Convocation.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Thirteenth Chapter,</hi> entituled, Concerning the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty or uncertainty of Perseverance, (passing over the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which will be of no use to us to find out the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) Pag. 81, the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists</hi> are charged to <hi>presume, not only to know all things that belong to their present justification, as assuredly as they know that Christ is in Heaven; but also to be as sure of their eternal election, and of their future glorification, as they are of this Article of their Creed, that Christ was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary. If any Calvinist <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ver said so, he erred greatly, not knowing the Scriptures, or the deceitfulness of his own heart. But if never any Calvinist said so, what shall then be done to him that so presumptuously bears false witness against them? Certainly the Calvinists do not hold, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Perseverance is so fundamental, or so clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in Scripture, as the Doctrine of Christ's Nativity; so far are they from holding that they themselves, or any of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40538:107"/>
them, do as certainly know the goodness of their present state, or their eternal election, as they firmly believe the Article of their Saviour's being born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> They are all wont to distinguish of <hi>a certitude of the object,</hi> and <hi>a certitude of the subject</hi>; they say, 'tis certain from the Word, that he who is a sound Believer, shall continue to be a Believer, until he attain the end of his Faith: But they say, a man may be a Believer, and yet not be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he does believe; and if once he had a certain perswasion of his faith, he may lose that perswasion: and many of them (I am sure) say, that he must lose it as oft as he falls into any conscience-wasting sin. This is the Doctrine that agrees with our Articles, and with the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our first Reformers. If any man deliver the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Perseverance at a higher rate, the Calvinists are not concerned to defend him.</p>
               <p>The sixteenth Article of our Church is brought by the <hi>Dr.</hi> against Perseverance: The words of it are these, <hi>Not every deadly sin committed after Baptism, is the sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable; wherefore the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as do fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin; and by the grace of God we may rise again, and amend our lives: and therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they live here; or deny place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.</hi> From which Article they may, in the judgment of our Church, be concluded to be in an error, who hold that every sin committed after Baptism, is the sin against the Holy Ghost: but so do not the Calvinists hold. They also are by this Article condemned, who say, they can no more sin as long as they live here: but what Calvinists say so? They finally are condemned, who deny place of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to such as truly repent: in which number the Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists cannot be placed, but some of the Remonstrants may; and it were to be wished, that some of our <hi>Arminianizing</hi> English Writers might not also be placed among them. The Article having made a [<hi>therefore</hi>] its strange that any one should draw any other conclusion from it, than what it self hath drawn: as strange that any one should write, that our Church intended by this Article to determine,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40538:108"/>
that the faith by which the just man lives, may be totally lost. Let an Argument be made, The Church says, <hi>after we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from the grace given, and fall into sin</hi>; therefore it saith, <hi>we may fall into such a sin as quite extinguisheth grace</hi>; or therefore it saith, that <hi>grace may be quite and for ever lost,</hi> Any one that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands himself, will deny both these Consequents; and deny them he may without danger or fear. But let us view the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s thoughts about this Article. <hi>Pag.</hi> 84, he bolts out a <hi>Maxime in the Civil Law,</hi> Non esse distinguendum ubi Lex non distinguit; <hi>that no distinction must be made in the explicating and expounding any Law, which is not to be found in the Law it self.</hi> I acknowledge, that such a saying is commonly quoted from the Civilians; and as they understand it, it is very rational: But how do the Calvinists willingly oppose themselves against this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime? Their Tenent is, <hi>Regeniti nunquam totaliter exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt a gratia</hi>; and some of them perhaps say, <hi>Regeniti non possunt excidere a gratia totaliter.</hi> If any man will disprove them from the Article, he must out of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle draw some conclusion that contradicts their Tenent: which if any one go about to do, he will find himself at a loss, and will be never able to put them to the cost of a distinction. Foreseeing that this maxime might not serve his turn, he tells us that, <hi>for the clear understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Churches meaning, we must have recourse in this, as in other Articles, to the plain words of Bishop</hi> Hooper <hi>and Bishop</hi> Latimer. But why must we have recourse to these mens Writings, above and beyond all other mens of that age, Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> never resuming his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, cannot be thought to be in any capacity to sit so much as a Member of the Convocation 1552. Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi> indeed had a right to a place in the Upper House, and 'tis like took his place; but his <hi>Exposition on the Commandments,</hi> was printed four years before that Convocation sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e. My Edition, which I use, was printed 1548, when he was a popular Preacher, and, I think, an unlicenced Preacher: Bishop he was not till 1550<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if this Book had been made after the conclusion of the Convocation, it could be no Rule to interpret the Articles, which were drawn up, at least in one point,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40538:108"/>
quite contrary to his declared judgment. If every thing in that Book pass for the Doctrine of the Church, down fall all our Gentlemens Pigeon-houses, down falls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But what need all this? Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi> hath not any thing in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to his <hi>Exposition on the ten Commandments</hi> for total A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie, or against Perseverance. He only saith, <hi>the cause of some mens damnation is this, that after they have received the promise of the Gospel, by accustomed doing of ill, they fall unto a contempt of the Gospel.</hi> Many a man receives the promise of the Gospel, who doth not receive it into a good honest heart, and therefore was never sanctified or justified. Was not then the <hi>Doctor</hi> hard put to it, when he could find no pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in <hi>Hooper</hi> to oppose to the Doctrine of Perseverance, but only this? If <hi>Hooper</hi> speak no more plainly in his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase on the thirteenth Chapter of the Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> than in his Preface to his <hi>Exposition of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> he speaks just nothing at all to the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s purpose. As neither doth Mr. <hi>Tindal</hi> in his Prologue to his <hi>Exposition of the Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi>; whose words are brought in for sundry lines, <hi>pag.</hi> 85, but tend only to prove, <hi>that if a man break the Law, he must sue for a new pardon, and have a new light against sin, hell, and desperation, ere he can come to a quiet faith again, and feel that sin is forgiven; and that the promise of mercy and forgiveness is made on this condition, that we sin no more.</hi> Some Followers of <hi>Islebius Agricola,</hi> may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture enter their dissent from Mr. <hi>Tindal</hi> in this matter; so may also the English Antinomians: but so need not any one who embraceth the Determinations of the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi>; for in those Determinations, if they were searched with a candle, it will never be found, that men are not bound to renew their repentance, as they renew their sin; or that they can have a quiet conscience, or sense of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, till they have converted themselves out of every snare of the Devil.</p>
               <p>It had been, it seems, objected by Mr. <hi>Hickman,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> himself, both in his <hi>Gagg</hi> and his <hi>Appeal,</hi> had confessed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Church had left it undecided, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Saint may fall totally and finally?

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Doth he indeed say so? Where may such a man as I am find him saying so? <hi>Page,</hi> not 28, but 26, he saith, <hi>That there is not from the Church any tie put on him, to resolve in this much disputed Question, as these Novellers would have it; for it there be any, it is for a possibility of total falling, as we shall hear anon.</hi> Is this to say expresly, that the Church hath so determined? then farewel the study of Logick. I am sure however, that if he said it, he hath not proved it. <hi>Pag.</hi> 29, he quotes the words of the Article, <hi>After that we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart away from grace, and fall into sin; and by the grace of God we may rise again, and amend our lives.</hi> After quoting of them, as if his heart had misgiven him, he addeth, <hi>Haply you will quarrel at the sense of the Articles: but then you must remember, that the plain words sound to the meaning for which I have produced them; and that until the Church it self expound otherwise, it is as free for me to take it according to the letter, as for you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise a figure.</hi> Which done, he goes on most untruly to tell the World, that this Article was challenged for unsound by the Ministers at the <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> Conference. Of which untruth, and sundry others relating to Dr. <hi>Overal,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> he hath been told by so many, that it is a wonder any man should not be ashamed to plough with his Heifer. The Arguments out of the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> whether in the form of Baptism, or in the publick Catechism, or Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick before Confirmation, are quite besides the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie; which is by many Calvinists restrained to the grace bestowed on Adult persons, and by none understood of that Sacramental grace given to the Seed of Believers in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40538:109"/>
Baptism. His Reasons from the <hi>Homilies,</hi> if they were of any force when managed by another, do lose their whole strength when they come from him; who hath told us,
<q>That he willingly admits the Homilies, as containing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain godly and wholsome Exhortations, but not as the publick dogmatical Resolutions confirmed by the Church of <hi>England:</hi> They may seem to speak somewhat too hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and stretch some sayings beyond the use and practice of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>
But let it suffice, that he hath trampled upon our Homilies with a foot of pride. I dare not so do, honouring the memory, and reverencing the judgment of those who made them; and much more the Authority that hath enjoyed them to be read in Churches. Let Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> and Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> argue from the Homilies, as if they had never traduced them. Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> argues from the title of one of the Homilies, which is, <hi>Falling away from God:</hi> as if the very title were a sufficient warrant for his opinion. Whereas no one of our Homilies is entituled, <hi>Of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away from God,</hi> but only <hi>Of falling from God.</hi> Ridiculous it would be adds D. <hi>Heylin</hi> p. 88. to <hi>write a Sermon</hi> de non ente; <hi>to terrifie the people with the danger of that misfortune, which they were well assured they should never suffer.</hi> By which addition he makes himself more than ridiculous; for people are not by the Calvinists well assured, that they shall never suffer the misfortune of falling from God: but are told, that they fall from God, as oft as they turn away from God's Law; and that by every such turning away from God's Law, if wilful, they lose some degree of grace, and expose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the wrath of God, and lose all sense of his favour: and this is sufficient to terrifie any man that is in his right wits and senses. Nor doth the Homily it self more favour them, than the title of it; Out of which neither collects more than a conditional, <hi>If they be unthankful, If they do not order their lives,</hi> &amp;c. Now the very Rule of the Logicians is, <hi>Conditionalis nihil ponit in esse.</hi> Will Doctor <hi>Heylin</hi> quarrel against this Rule? Yes; for Mr. <hi>Yates</hi> having brought such a kind of Answer, he saith of it, that <hi>it is a sorrier shift than any before; for if such conditional Propositions conclude nothing positively, what will become of all those Propositions in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, by which we are assured, If we repent, we shall find mercy of the Lord? Do they conclude nothing positively neither?
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40538:110"/>
Most miserable were the state of man, if these conditional Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions should conclude nothing to the comfort of a troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> pag. 96. O dreadful ignorance! Can a conditional Proposition conclude nothing positively and determinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, unless it conclude, that its <hi>antecedent</hi> shall actually come to pass, or may come to pass? When <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>If an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from Heaven preach another Gospel, let him be accursed</hi>; this conditional will conclude, that whoever preacheth another Gospel, is accursed: it will not conclude, that ever any Angel can, or shall preach another Gospel. What pity it is, that men should adventure to write Books, after they have forgot the common Elements of Logick? and what shame is it, that men should dare to bring in passages out of our Homilies, and omit a material Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renthesis that occurs in all Copies of them? as any one may see, that both Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> and Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> have done. I only desire, seeing the Homilies are commonly to be had, that my Readers would be pleased to compare them with the quotations of Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> p. 89, and remember that the thing he is to prove out of the Homilies, is, <hi>that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Saints may fall totally and finally from sanctifying grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> and then let him be deceived if he can: provided that he will also consider, what passages Mr. <hi>Yates</hi> and Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> have collected out of the Homilies, to confirm Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance.</p>
               <p>One more Authority Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> produceth, and it filleth up, <hi>pag.</hi> 90, 91. It is the Authority of <hi>Lanceiot Ridley</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> out of whose <hi>Comment</hi> on the <hi>Colos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians,</hi> he collects something relating to all, or most of the controverted Points; but the Collections, if all truly made, have not in them so much as a seeming contrariety to any of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Tenents. But in this very Arch-dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con's <hi>Comment</hi> on the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> finds personal Election; and if Election, then Perseverance also.

                  <q>Our Gospellers <hi>(saith he)</hi> he better learned than the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost; for they wickedly attribute the cause of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and adversities to God's providence; which is the cause of no ill, as he himself can do no evil: and over every mischief that is done, they say, it is God's will.</q>
                  <hi>In which we have the men and their Doctrine; how the name of</hi> Gospellers, <hi>and the reason why that name was ascribed to them. It is observed by the judicious Author of</hi> Europae Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum, <hi>that</hi> Calvin <hi>was the first of these latter times, who searched into the Counsels (the eternal Counsels) of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty: And, as it seems, he found there some other Gospel than that which had been written by the four Evangelists, from whence his Followers had the name of</hi> Gospellers; <hi>for by that name I find them called frequently by</hi> Campneys <hi>also, in an Epistolary discourse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And finding it given them also by Bishop</hi> Hooper, <hi>(a temperate modest man)
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40538:111"/>
I must needs look on it as the name of the Sect, by which they were distinguished from other men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> All this I have at large transcribed, because I have sundry observations to make thereupon. First, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that in all probability the <hi>Doctor</hi> never read <hi>Hooper,</hi> but trusted to other mens eyes; for he quoteth that as from the Preface of Mr. <hi>Hooper,</hi> which is not to be found in the Preface, but rather in his Postscript, or Appendix to his Declaration of the ten holy Commandments, or his Answer to certain Objections, that keep men from the obedience of God's Law, the fourth of which is Curiosity: Nor is this the first time that he hath suffered himself and his Reader to be abused. Secondly, I observe, that he attributes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hese words to the Reverend Prelate, and right godly Martyr, Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi>; whereas <hi>Hooper,</hi> when he did write these words, was no Prelate, but only a licenced, if licenced, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicant. But I am glad however to find Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> speak of honourably of the Ring-leader of the Non-conformists. It seems, when he is pleased, he can allow one that scrupled the Habit, and expresly condemned the Civil Offices of Bishops, to be reverend, and right godly, and temperate, and modest. Thirdly, I observe, that he chargeth Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,</hi> from the Author of <hi>Europae Speculum,</hi> to be the first in these latter times that searched into the Counsels, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counsels, of Almighty God. That the Author of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropae Speculum</hi> hath any such observation, I am not sure: If he have, it no way contributed to procure him that esteem with which the World reads his Book; for, as all eternal Counsels are the Counsels of Almighty God, so all the Counsels of God Almighty are eternal: And to say, that <hi>Calvin</hi> was the first, who in this latter age searched into the Counsels of Almighty God, is in effect to say, that none of this latter age before <hi>Calvin,</hi> regarded God's glory or mans salvation. I suppose instead of <hi>eternal</hi> Counsels, the <hi>Doctor</hi> intended to say, hidden, <hi>unrevealed</hi> Counsels. But the assertion of absolute Election and Reprobation, is no searching into the secrets of God Almighty: or if it be, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> cannot, by any one that hath the least skill in History, be thought to be the first that searched into God's secret Counsels; seeing both <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> had done it before him. Fourthly, I observe, the unrighteous
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40538:111"/>
censure or calumny of the <hi>Doctor,</hi> that <hi>Calvin,</hi> by searching into God's Decrees, had found out another Gospel than that which had been written by the four Evangelists, from whence his Followers in these Points had the name of <hi>Gospellers.</hi> Neither <hi>Calvin,</hi> nor <hi>Calvinists,</hi> ever found out any other Gospel than this, <hi>He that believeth, shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; he that believeth not, shall be damned.</hi> Nor was the name of <hi>Gospellers</hi> given to Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Followers, on the account of their bringing in a new Gospel, or on any other account: but it was the general name by which all that joyned in opposing Popery called themselves. Let any one but consult the word, <hi>Gospellers,</hi> in the Index of Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>'s Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrology, and compare the places there referred unto, he shall find <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Gospellers</hi> still opposed; &amp; <hi>Gospellers</hi> used, not as a name of ignoming but as a name of honour. Let him also read Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi>'s Letter to his Chaplain, he shall find the same word used, and contradistinguished to Papists. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in Latine no more usual distinction than <hi>Pontificii</hi> and <hi>Evangelici:</hi> So that the <hi>Historian,</hi> in making the Calvinists the only <hi>Gospellers,</hi> makes them indeed the only <hi>Protestants.</hi> Finally, I observe, that the words quoted from Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi> are inexcusable, if they be not qualified with some distinction. The Scripture doth not oftner ascribe unto God the Creation of the World, than it doth ascribe unto his Providence all the Punishments and Adversities that befal either good or bad men: yet it must be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that God does not willingly afflict the sons of men; and therefore never punishes them, but when he finds something in them which deserves the punishment; so that they may thank themselves for all the evil they suffer from God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi>'s next design is to vindicate one <hi>Campneys,</hi> a Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that was made to bear a Faggot at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, the learned and pious <hi>Miles Coverdale</hi> preaching a Sermon when that punishment was inflicted on him. This man, it seems, having either complied in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> time, or saved himself alive by flight, when Q <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> had restored the true Religion began to play his old pranks, <hi>i. e.</hi> to cause disturbance, by nibbling at such who were deservedly honoured and preferred in the Church; publishing a Pamphlet, but unto which he had not courage
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40538:112"/>
enough to affix his name, against Predestination. This Pamphlet was encountred by Mr. <hi>Iohn Veron,</hi> a Chaplain to the Queen, and Reader of the Divinity Lecture in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church, as also by Mr. <hi>Robert Crowley,</hi> sometime Fellow of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxon,</hi> at that time a famous Preacher in the City of <hi>London</hi>; Both these put out Answers unto <hi>Campneys,</hi> and their Answers were both licenced and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and <hi>Veron</hi>'s Dedicated to the Queen her self; whereas <hi>Campney</hi>'s virulent Pamphlet came forth sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptitiously, neither Author nor Printer daring to put their names to it. All this notwithstanding, the <hi>Doctor</hi> would have us believe, that <hi>Campneys</hi> defended the Doctrine of the Church, <hi>Veron</hi> and <hi>Crowley</hi> opposed it; as if the Church had so soon lost all her zeal for her Religion, and would give no countenance at all to those that contended for it, yet would vouchsafe to authorize the writings of those that vigorously fought against it. We need not say, that <hi>Campneys</hi> deserved all the ill names that <hi>Veron</hi> and <hi>Crowley</hi> bestowed on him, perhaps their zeal might be in some particulars too bitter; yet we cannot think that men of so great repute and learning would charge Pelagianism and Popery, upon one that had honestly declared himself against both Popery and Pelagianism. — The <hi>Doctor</hi> tells us that Campneys <hi>hath sufficiently purged himself of both these crimes</hi>; And indeed, by reading his Book, I find that he hath declared himself against Merit; but so hath many a professed Papist done. He doth also muster up the errors of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> publickly recanted by him in the Synod of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine,</hi> declaring them (or at least one of them) to be vile and abominable: This notwithstanding, it is possible he might be a very Pelagian. <hi>Austin</hi> himself doth not speak more sharply against <hi>Pelagius</hi> than do the Ring-leaders of the Semipelagians, and yet they erre as bad an errour as the Pelagians do. But of all these matters let indifferent Readers judge, by comparing <hi>Campneys</hi> Book with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers made to it.</p>
               <p>More I need not say about the <hi>sixteenth Chapter,</hi> had it not pleased the <hi>Historian</hi> to defame <hi>Calvin, Beza</hi> and <hi>Knox. Calvin</hi> and <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40538:112"/>
them; yet they never left persecuting and reviling him, till they had first cast him out of</hi> Geneva, <hi>and afterwards brought him to his grave, meerly because he differed from them about Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi>'s learning, modesty, and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are sufficiently vindicated by others. <hi>Castalio</hi> discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little either of modesty or moderation, in his bitter censures of the Book of <hi>Canticles,</hi> or in the help and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he afforded unto the cursed Socinians. <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> are not the only persons that have condemned him; nor did they condemn him meerly, or principally, for differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them in the point of Predestination, as the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> might have known, if he had rather consulted the impartial Historians of that time, than <hi>Castalio</hi>'s own writings.</p>
               <p>For Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> styled <hi>pag.</hi> 5, <hi>The great Incendiary of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Kirk of</hi> Scotland, I will not undertake an Apology. His own Country-men, who were better acquainted with his principles and practices, may better do it. Yet because I find him to have taken great pains in promoting our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation here in <hi>England,</hi> I shall adventure to mind the <hi>Doctor,</hi> that <hi>Spotswood,</hi> purposely employed by our King to write the History of the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and having also by the King liberty given him to write tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>The <hi>Injunctions</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are mentioned by the <hi>Doctor</hi> pag. 19, in which he observes, that <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his Paraphrases were appointed to be provided for every Church, <hi>Injunct.</hi> 6. and <hi>Injunct.</hi> 16, that every Parson, Vicar, Curate, Stipendiary Priest, (he omits, under the degree of a Master of Arts,) should provide and have of his own, the New Testament in Latine and English, with the Paraphrases, (the <hi>Injunction</hi> saith only, with Paraphrases.)</q>
The conclusion he hence infers, hath been before considered.
<q>I must take notice, that the 51. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> straitly chargeth and commandeth, that no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of person shall Print any manner of Book or Paper, of what sort, nature, or in what Language soever it be, except the same be first licenced by her Majesty by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words in writing, or by six of her Privy Conncel, or be perused and licenced by the Archbishops of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> the Chancellors of both Universities, the Bishop being Ordinary, and the Archdeacon also of the place where any such shall be Printed or by two of them, whereof the Ordinary of the place shall always be one; and that the names of such as shall allow the same, be added to the end of every such work, for a testimony of the allowance thereof.</q>
From this <hi>Injunction</hi> I infer, that <hi>Campneys</hi> had no respect at all unto the Queens Order, or else he would not have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished his Papers without Authority. I also infer secondly, that neither Queen, nor Councel, nor Archbishops, nor Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, were of <hi>Campneys</hi> mind, because else he would have prevailed with some of them to authorize his Book, that it might have been more passable. And now, if the <hi>Doctor</hi> have got any thing by these <hi>Injunctions,</hi> much good may it do him.</p>

We have Records, from which it may appear who were <hi>Anno</hi> 1562, Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Bishops: amongst them all it will be hard to find any one that was not a cordial Friend unto the Doctrine of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi>; some of them are blamed for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing too well with them in matter of Discipline and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony also: the names of almost all may be found in Mr. <hi>Fuller, Book</hi> 9. <hi>p.</hi> 69. But the <hi>Historian</hi> would have done no less than wonders, if he had informed us, how the passing of the <hi>Articles</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s first <hi>Convocation,</hi> could be a probable means to suppress the growth of the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Doctrine. Certain I am, that if they were designed for any such use, they had no prosperous success; but were in the days of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> made use of to suppress the <hi>Antizuinglian</hi> Doctrine. Indeed the <hi>seventeenth Article</hi> plainly lays down such a Predestination, as the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calvinistical</hi> ear cannot hear: and the <hi>Homilies,</hi> so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the <hi>Articles,</hi> have a little too much <hi>Calvinism</hi> in them; for they place Faith in such a kind of assurance, as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> indeed thought essential to Faith, but is found by experience to be separable from it. I would transcribe the passages in the <hi>Homilies</hi> that relate unto the five Points; but Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> hath already done it, and done it so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that nothing considerable seems to have escaped his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. I beg of my <hi>Reader,</hi> that he would vouchsafe to put together Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Prin</hi>'s Allegations out of the <hi>Homilies,</hi> and then pass judgment.</p>
               <p>There was a probable Argument drawn from the <hi>Prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor</hi> of this <hi>Convocation,</hi> Mr. <hi>Alexander Nowel.</hi> He must needs be supposed fully to know the mind and sense of those that confirm'd the <hi>Articles</hi>; nor can it be supposed, that he had not a great hand in the drawing of them up: yet this reverend and learned Person, in his <hi>Catechism,</hi> publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him after this <hi>Convocation,</hi> doth declare himself for absolute Election. Places clearly proving this were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged out of an <hi>English Translation</hi> of that <hi>Catechism</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:40538:114"/>
by Mr. <hi>Norton,</hi> dedicated to the two Arch-Bishops, the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> by name, and to all the Bishops in the several Diocesses in <hi>England:</hi> this was printed by <hi>Iohn Day,</hi> with the Queens Majesties priviledge for ten years, <hi>An.</hi> 1575. In answering this Objection the <hi>Doctor</hi> spends many words, even so many as make up <hi>pag.</hi> 24, 25, 26, 27. Of some of these words I know not how to make any sense. Of others of them I think I know the meaning, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive their design; for admitting <hi>there hath been a greater Catechism of</hi> Mr. <hi>Nowels,</hi> admitting <hi>that which is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to be taught in Schools is the less and not the bigger,</hi> what is either gained or lost, unless the Author had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his judgment with some diversity in the two <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisms</hi>? which is not, cannot be pretended. What though I do not find any one single Question concerning Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination or the Points thereupon, may not the Author in Answer to other Questions sufficiently declare his mind? I will set down the passages quoted by Mr. <hi>Hickman</hi> at large.
<q>To the Church do all they properly belong, as many as do truly fear and honour and call upon God, altogether applying their minds to live holily and godly, and, putting all their trust in God, do most assuredly look for the blessedness of eternal life. They that be stedfast, stable, constant in this Faith, were chosen and appointed, and (as we term it) Predestinated to this so great Felicity.</q>
Again,
<q>The Church is the Body of the Christian Common-wealth, <hi>i. e.</hi> the universal number and fellowship of the Faithful, whom God through Christ hath before all beginning of time appointed to everlasting life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This the <hi>Doctor</hi> saith <hi>is not to be found in the Latine Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But I say, and am sure of it, it is to be found in the Latine Edition of 1570. set forth by the Author, and print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Reginald Wolf,</hi> the Queens Latine Printer.</p>
               <p>He saith secondly, <hi>It is taken almost word for word out of Bishop</hi> Poinet<hi>'s Catechism; and therefore must be understood in no other sense than before it was, when it was perused and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Bishops, and other Learned men of King</hi> Edward<hi>'s time.</hi> If so, then up goes <hi>Calvinism</hi>; for we have before proved Arch-Deacon <hi>Philpot,</hi> one of those Learned men, expresly to own <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Predestination; nor is it possible
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40538:114"/>
to interpret <hi>Poinet</hi>'s words so, as that Faith shall be an antecedent and not consequent of Predestination. He that saith, <hi>only those who are predestinated to Eternal life believe,</hi> doth say, that <hi>no Believer can finally fall from Faith,</hi> if he understand the necessary consequences of his saying, as in justice we are bound to think so great a <hi>Scholar</hi> as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Poinet</hi> did. But of <hi>Poinet</hi> no more.
Mr. <hi>Nowel</hi>'s own words are plain and clear for <q>an election unto Faith and Salvation, before the foundations of the World were laid;</q>
and that <q>they who are thus elected, have in their own minds the spirit of Christ, the Author of this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and in like manner a most certain pledge of it:</q>
The Scholar finally is taught to say, that<q> by the instinct of the Divine Spirit, he most certainly perswades himself, that he also by God's good gift through Christ, is freely made one of this blessed City.</q>
And it is further worth observation, that there is scarce any one place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made use of by the <hi>Calvinists</hi> to prove Personal ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which Mr. <hi>Nowel</hi> hath not put into the Margin of his <hi>Catechism; Matth.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 15, 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. and 5.5. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.13, 14. and 5.30. All this notwithstanding the <hi>Doctor</hi> pleaseth himself, as if Mr. <hi>Nowel</hi> were his own. And that he might not seem to lay claim to him without some gound, he produceth two places out of his <hi>lesser Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism,</hi> promised by the Author in the Epistle Dedicatory of the <hi>larger,</hi> and now, as more apt for youth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taught in Grammar Schools, <hi>page</hi> 33. In tender compassion unto <hi>him</hi> and my <hi>Reader,</hi> I will not relate them; but they are both such, as any <hi>Calvinist</hi> will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace with both arms, as savouring of that special Faith that some ancient <hi>Calvinists,</hi> too securely following their <hi>Master,</hi> contend for. In it the <hi>Doctor</hi> finds, that <hi>we are elected by</hi> or through <hi>faith in Christ; therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>the Decree of Election is not absolute and irrespective.</hi> Nor do the <hi>Calvinists</hi> say, <hi>it is,</hi> without a limitation or distinction of the words <hi>irrespective</hi> and <hi>absolute.</hi> The second passage is such, as no <hi>Remonstrant</hi> can mention without abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for <hi>Remonstrants</hi> do utterly deny, that God made any Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> that if he stood all his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity should stand if he sell all his Posterity should fall,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40538:115"/>
and be corrupted with Original Sin: but the <hi>Calvinist</hi> is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for this Covenant; and no less eagerly doth he contend, that God promised to send Christ, the Seed of the Woman, to break the Serpent's head, that is, the Devil, and so to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him and his Posterity that believed the same; for this, if it proves any thing, proves particular Redemption: which the most famous <hi>Calvinists</hi> now a days do not contend for; some of them have written whole Books against it. I shall only insert one passage more out of Mr. <hi>Nowel</hi>'s Catechism, relating to the peremptoriness and irreversibility of God's will of purpose; it is in his <hi>Exposition</hi> of the <hi>third Petition</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Prayer: Non tantum precantur ut quod illi decretum fuerit eveniat; quod, quum divina voluntas efficiendi necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem secum semper adferat, evenire necesse est, &amp;c.</hi> quoting in the Margin <hi>Psal.</hi> 115.3, and 135.6, 7, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19. And so my Pen takes its leave of this holy and learned Person a constant hearer of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>; both wonderfully preserved from the fury of the Bishops, and both, no doubt, of one mind in these matters.</p>
               <p>In the next place I am to wait on the <hi>Doctor</hi> to the <hi>Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>Homilies</hi>; for he hath adventured to look into them: and a great adventure it had been to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, if so be he had looked into them with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as well to answer what had been alledged against him by Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> as to consider what made for him. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready entreated my <hi>Reader</hi> to give himself the trouble of comparing passages of all sorts, and then there will remain no further trouble for me. I am sure no man can think, that any thing in the 29, 30, 31, <hi>pages</hi> of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s third <hi>Part,</hi> collected out of the <hi>Homilies,</hi> is contradictory to the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists</hi> assertions rightly understood. The <hi>Homily</hi> of the <hi>Nativity</hi> saith, <hi>Christ must be not only full and perfect man, but also full and perfect God; to the intent he might more fully and perfectly make satisfaction for mankind. This,</hi> saith the Doctor, <hi>is as plain as words can make it.</hi> And <hi>plain</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is, against any that deny either the Deity or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Christ (those that do so, usually deny God's Decrees too;) but there is here neither <hi>plain,</hi> nor obscure words, or word against <hi>Calvinists.</hi> Every one will laugh at the passage brought for Universal Grace, out of the first part of the <hi>Sermon against the peril of Idolatry</hi>; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40538:115"/>
to no more than this, that <hi>Idolatry is against the light of Nature as well as Scripture:</hi> Yet in this passage did he so much please himself, that he proceeds to tell us, that <hi>in the third Part of that</hi> Sermon, <hi>there are some passages, that do as plainly speak of falling from God, the final alienation of the soul of a man once righteous from his love and favour.</hi> Such pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages as these would be worth Gold, the fine Gold of <hi>Ophir.</hi> He names but one, which is this, <hi>How much better were it, that the Arts of Painting and we had never been found, than one of them whose souls are so precious in the sight of God, should by occasion of Image or Picture, perish and be lost.</hi> This passage looks as if it were designed to perswade Christian Magistrates to break down all Images of God, Christ, the Saints, especially in Churches, (on which score these <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons against Idolatry</hi> have been decried by sundry of the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Friends;) but what hath it in it, that by all the help of the whole Art of Logick can militate against Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance? <hi>Better it were that Painting had never been found out, than that by occasion of a Picture, a precious Soul should perish and be lost</hi>; therefore <hi>the Souls of the Elect, of justified and righteous Persons, may be totally and finally alienated from the grace and favour of God.</hi> I will form his other Argument against Perseverance out of the <hi>Homily</hi> of the <hi>Resurrection. The Homilist very affectionately disswades those that are risen with Christ from returning to sin</hi>; therefore <hi>he took it for granted, that some truly sanctified Souls might totally and finally fall from grace.</hi> These two are pretty, but the prettiest passage of all is still behind; <hi>The co-operation of mans will with the grace of God</hi> (he must mean, or else he trifleth, in the very first moment of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,) <hi>is presumed, or else our</hi> Church <hi>had not writ any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies at all.</hi> Just so he might argue, that <hi>if</hi> Calvin <hi>had not held co-operation, he would never have preached Sermons.</hi> And indeed out of <hi>Calvin, Beza, Zuinglius,</hi> may easily be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five hundred places that have a more seeming and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable face of contrariety against <hi>Calvinism,</hi> than any that the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath made a shift to gather out of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Homilies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet least he might be thought faint-hearted, he goes on from the <hi>Homilies</hi> to Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> the Copier out of <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>'s Sermons and Lectures, his intima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Friend at <hi>Oxford,</hi> his Guest at <hi>Strasborough</hi> and <hi>Zurich,</hi> and his Assistant in compiling his <hi>Comment</hi> on <hi>Iudges.</hi> In his <hi>Defence</hi> of his <hi>Apology,</hi> he saith, that <hi>Christ by saying, it is finished, plainly signified, persolutum jam esse prectum pro peccato humani generis:</hi> By which the good Bishop sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared himself to be no friend to Popish Satisfactions. But what can hence be inferred, either for or against <hi>Calvinism?</hi> Did ever any <hi>Calvinist</hi> say, that Christ did not pay the whole price? or that God did expect any part of the price from the hands of any other? I, but <hi>it was paid for the sin of mankind.</hi> True; but not for the sin of every particular person of mankind: though if it had been so said by <hi>Iewel,</hi> many <hi>Calvinists</hi> would have liked <hi>Iewel</hi> the better for such a speech.</p>
               <p>At length the <hi>Doctor</hi> hits upon one just of his mind, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Samuel Harsnet,</hi> who preached at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cross <hi>Octob.</hi> 27, 1584, and preached <hi>Anticalviristically</hi> in all the five Points under Controversie. This must be granted him, if the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> were delivered as it was some few years since printed. Hence he argues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Sermon preached at St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s, at which no offence was taken, upon which no Recantation was enjoyned, nor any complaint made; had no matter in it contrary to the Rules of the</hi> Church, <hi>and the appointment of the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Harsnet<hi>'s Sermon was such a Sermon, preached at St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s, &amp;c.</hi> Ergo, <hi>it had no matter in it contrary to the Rules of the</hi> Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Either the <hi>Doctor</hi> thinks the <hi>major</hi> of this Syllogism true, or he does not. If he does not, then can he have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his own Syllogism. If he do, then will it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follow that, in <hi>Calvinism</hi> there is nothing contrary to the Rules of the <hi>Church,</hi> because so many <hi>Calvinistical</hi> Sermons have been preached at <hi>Paul</hi>'s, which were never complained of to Authority, nor any Recantation enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, yea, for which the Preachers have had thanks and preferments. Besides, if Mr. <hi>Harsnet</hi> had been complained of and Recantation enjoyned him, the <hi>Doctor</hi> would not have accounted him the less Orthodox on that account; for he knows and will afterwards confess, that Recantation hath been enjoyned for such kind of Sermons as Mr. <hi>Harsnet</hi>'s was. So that I can scarce tell, whether it
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40538:116"/>
be worth while to descend to the <hi>minor</hi> of the former Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism; for what will it advantage us to prove, that the Sermon was Censured and Recanted, when as those we have to deal with are resolved to think, that lawful Authority hath enjoyned Recantations of Sermons agreeable to the <hi>Articles of Religion?</hi> Yet because we are in <hi>genere Historico,</hi> I deny the <hi>minor</hi>; and say, It doth appear that <hi>offence was taken at the forementioned Sermon,</hi> that <hi>complaint was made of it,</hi> and that <hi>the Preacher did at least declare his sorrow for it:</hi> perhaps not heartily, for he seems to have lived and died an Arminian; yet <hi>he did declare his sorrow for the preaching of that his Sermon.</hi> Had he not so done, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity no doubt had spewed him out; especially living in a Colledge where Dr. <hi>Fulke</hi> was Master, a man, that in his <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Rhemists,</hi> hath thought himself as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to vindicate the Doctrine of Election and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Points thereupon depending, as any other Doctrine of our Reformation whatever. Doth any one ask me, how it appears that Mr. <hi>Harsnet</hi> and his <hi>Sermon</hi> was so censured and condemned? I answer, It appears from the plain testimony of Mr. <hi>William Prin, page</hi> 304, of his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity,</hi> printed at such a time, when Prudence as well as Conscience would have restrained him from uttering an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth against so great a man as <hi>Harsnet</hi> was then become? Can it be imagined, that if this had been a slander, so great a Prelate of our Nation would not have demanded repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and satisfaction? As for the <hi>Doctor's</hi> Argument, that <hi>seeing the Sermon was preached at the Cross, the University could take no cognizance of it</hi>; it is such, as I suppose upon second thoughts, he will wish he had never made use of.</p>
               <p>And he hath as much reason to wish, that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver troubled his Book with any thing of Bishop <hi>King</hi>'s Lectures upon <hi>Ionah:</hi> in which nothing is to be found against absolute Predestination; nor yet any thing from which any probable collection can be made, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop had conceived in his own mind any opinion about it contrary to Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s; nor could the <hi>Doctor</hi> himself collect any thing from them, till he had first supposed, which no one will grant him, <hi>that there is the same reason of God's eternal Election and his Promises, as of his eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and his threatnings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:40538:117"/>This done; the <hi>Historian</hi> fills his <hi>nineteenth Chapter</hi> with lamentations and weeping, bewailing the sad condition of the <hi>Church,</hi> that was feign, in her Reformation under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to make use of <hi>any Learned man that had zeal against Popery,</hi> to discharge the places of greatest trust and Authority in the Church, how <hi>Calvinistical</hi> soever they were for Doctrine. But when was that it the <hi>Church</hi> was put to this strait? was it not in the first years of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>? and particularly in the year 1562, when the first <hi>Convocation</hi> was held? If so, what a piece of boldness was it to say, that <hi>that Convocation drew up</hi> Articles <hi>with any purpose to give check to</hi> Doctrinal Calvinism? and what uncharitableness is it to affirm, that <hi>our learned Divines did change their minds, when for a few years they were forced to change the air in the Reign of Queen</hi> Mary? What men of note had they to converse with beyond the Seas, whose Opinions and Arguments they had not read and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while in <hi>England</hi>? They must needs be clouds without water, if the breath of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Martyr</hi> could so easily toss them to and fro. But we know, those that went over <hi>Conformists,</hi> came home <hi>Conformists</hi>; and those that went over <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> came back <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> though somewhat strengthened in their <hi>Non-conformity,</hi> by the communion they had with the Protestant Churches beyond the Seas. I shall hereafter shew, that not only <hi>Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> Divines, but also the most zealous <hi>Conformists,</hi> did set themselves with all their might to declare against and crush the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine, as soon as in any place it began to be be delivered. And the <hi>Doctor</hi> may do well to remember, that Mr. <hi>Hooper</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> whom he hath before made so much use of, though to little purpose, were both of them <hi>Non-conformists</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s days: and Mr. <hi>Latimer,</hi> whom he also challengeth for his own, was litle better than a <hi>Non-conformist,</hi> letting fly sufficiently at the Dignities of the Reformed Prelates. So that, if these three men had been as much for him as he pretends, a man might say, English <hi>Arminianism</hi> did spring out of the root of <hi>Non-conformity:</hi> but it will appear, that it did spring from opposition to those wholsom Doctrines, in which all our Reformers, how much soever differing about Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, agreed.</p>

                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:40538:117"/>Mr. <hi>Iohn Fox</hi> his <hi>Martyrology,</hi> though dedicated to the Queen and by her accepted graciously, though highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by a <hi>Canon</hi> of the whole <hi>Convocation,</hi> 1571, the <hi>Historian</hi> expresly saith, <hi>he looketh on as the first great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery which was made on the Bulwarks of this</hi> Church, <hi>in point of Doctrine, by any Member of her own,</hi> page 58.

But did the <hi>Convocation</hi> appoint no balm for that wound made by the <hi>Martyrology</hi>? Yes, that it did, he thinks. What was it?
<q>Another <hi>Canon, page</hi> 60, that men should teach no other Doctrine in their publick Sermons to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved of the People, but what was agreeable to the Doctrine of the Old and New Testament, and had from thence been gathered by the Catholick Fathers, and ancient Bishops.</q>
I say, If this Canon had been observed, Mr. <hi>Harsnet</hi> had never preached his Sermon: He thinks, <hi>Calvinism</hi> had never been preached, <hi>because maintained by none of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Fathers, and ancient Bishops, but Saint</hi> Augustine <hi>only, who was but one Bishop, but one Father.</hi> All <hi>Calvinists</hi> will now easily forgive him his reproaches against <hi>Calvin,</hi> seeing he spares not St. <hi>Augustine.</hi> But I hope he will not forgive himself that passion, which produced so great an untruth. Had he said, none <hi>before</hi> St. <hi>Augustine</hi> maintained <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrines, the mistake had been excusable: so is it not, to say, that no Catholick Father or ancient Bishop, maintained it <hi>besides</hi> St. <hi>Augustine.</hi> Doubtless <hi>Prosper</hi> and <hi>Hilary</hi> were both <hi>Catholick Fathers,</hi> and <hi>ancient Bishops</hi>; yet they as much maintained <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Opinions as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> doth. Who are the Bishops and Catholick Fathers, that the <hi>Doctor</hi> follows in these Points of Predestination and grace? In his second <hi>Part, page</hi> 36, he quotes three ancient Writers. The first, <hi>Ambrose</hi> on the Epistles: yet
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40538:118"/>
every one knows, that those <hi>Commentaries</hi> on the <hi>Epistles</hi> are not his, but the work, as some think, of a <hi>Pelagian</hi>; as others, of one <hi>Hilary,</hi> no Bishop, though a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. He also quotes the <hi>Commentary</hi> upon Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epistles</hi> ascribed to St. <hi>Hierom:</hi> but he is not ignorant (or if he be ignorant, few other Scholars be.) that those <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,</hi> however formerly fathered on <hi>Hierom,</hi> do call <hi>Pelagius</hi> himself Father; and he, I trow, was no <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Father,</hi> or <hi>ancient Bishop,</hi> but a most vile Heretick. He also refers us to St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in <hi>Ep.</hi> 14. By which I know not what he means; but am sure it is little credit to a <hi>Doctor in Divinity</hi> living so near the University, to bring <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in <hi>Latine,</hi> whose <hi>Greek</hi> is so easie as that School-boys are able to understand it: so that if this had been any piece of a Sermon, I might certainly h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The best advice I can give them is, to buy such Books as contain a Confession of Faith confirmed all along with Scriptures and Fathers; in which I cannot but commend the <hi>Orthodoxus Consensus,</hi> dedicated by <hi>Gasper Laurentius</hi> to the Prince Elector <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine,</hi> bound up with the <hi>Corpus &amp; Syntagma confessio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Fidei</hi> printed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> 1654. There is also pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by <hi>Cyril,</hi> late Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith as <hi>Calvinistical</hi> as if it had been extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s own <hi>Institutions,</hi> which is now extant; confirmed all along by Scripture and Fathers, Catholick and ancient, in a little Piece put out by the learned <hi>Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinger:</hi> where also there is enough said of <hi>Cyril</hi>'s life, troubles, and death to free him from the aspersions cast on him by the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and by <hi>Grotius.</hi>

               <p>We have brought off Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> and must now see, whether the <hi>Historian</hi> do charge Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> with more success, of whom it is affirmed, <hi>page</hi> 62,
<q>That he did open wider the great breach, that had been made by <hi>Mr.</hi> Fox.</q>
Sure it may easily be pardoned him, that he made that breach wider which was made by the <hi>Church</hi> it self, by putting so much honour upon the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:40538:118"/>
as did, if we may believe this <hi>Doctor,</hi> manifestly tend to the subversion of that Doctrine that she had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten years before so solemnly ratified. But as it may well be presumed, that the <hi>Church</hi> would not consent to the picking out of her own eyes; so we have great reason to think, that Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> did design all his <hi>Treatises,</hi> only to commend that milk unto others which he had, with so much delight and nourishment, sucked from the Breasts of his Mother, the <hi>Reformed Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Treatise</hi> of his quarrelled at, is called <hi>Armilla Aurea, composed by the Author in</hi> Latine, <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated into</hi> English <hi>by Dr.</hi> Robert Hill, <hi>at the request of</hi> Perkins <hi>himself,</hi> (saith our <hi>Historian</hi>;) but tells us not whence he had that information: nor indeed is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> would <hi>request another</hi> to do a work that might easily be done, and yet could be done so well by no hand as his <hi>own.</hi>
                  <q>The <hi>Translator</hi> tells us plainly, in his <hi>Epistle Dedicatory</hi> unto the Judge of the <hi>Admiralty Court,</hi> that he made the Translation at the request of some well disposed, that his own Countrey-men might by it reap some profit:</q>
and perhaps also he had a design to reap some profit by his Countrey-men, presaging that it would be of very quick sale; as indeed it hapned, being printed fifteen times in the space of twenty years. Many of the greatest learning and judgment, thought this left-handed <hi>Ehud</hi> did by this his <hi>Book,</hi> wound the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Cause to the very heart. Our <hi>Historian</hi> thinks not so, and tells us <hi>page</hi> 64, that <hi>it found not like welcome in all places, nor from all hands. Parsons</hi> the <hi>Iesuite</hi> is brought in thus sleighting him, <hi>By the deep humour of fancy, he hath published and writ many Books with strange Titles, which neither He, nor his Reader do understand; as namely, about the</hi> Concatenation, <hi>or laying together of the causes of mans Predestination and Reprobation. And then Iacob van Harmin,</hi> he acquaints us, <hi>wrote a full discourse against it.</hi> I know not what he means by, <hi>it: Arminius</hi> his <hi>Examen,</hi> as we all know, being not designed against <hi>Perkins</hi> his <hi>Armilla Aurea</hi>; but against another Piece called a <hi>Treatise of Predestination, and of the largeness of God's grace.</hi> And that <hi>Examen</hi> of <hi>Arminius</hi> hath been so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by the learned Dr. <hi>Twiss,</hi> that no <hi>Remonstrant</hi> hath as yet had confidence enough to rejoyn. All the wind hitherto
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40538:119"/>
sent from the <hi>Doctor,</hi> hath shaken no corn: We can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn <hi>Parsons,</hi> and not value <hi>Arminius.</hi> He therefore fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acquaints us, <hi>page</hi> 65, of a <hi>very sharp censure passed upon Mr.</hi> Perkins, <hi>by the Doctor of the Chair in</hi> Oxford. What is this censure?
<q>No more, but that Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> otherwise a learned and pious Person, <hi>(therefore surely able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Title of his own Books,)</hi> did err no light er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, in making the subject of Divine Predestination, to be man considered before the fall: <hi>adding also further, that</hi> "some by undertaking to defend Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> in this opinion, had given unnecessary trouble to the Church.</q>
This censure is very gentle, in comparison of what the same Reverend and Learned Professor, afterwards Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> thought meet to pass upon <hi>Arminius, Bertius,</hi> and all their Followers; whom he accuseth <hi>of most detestable Sacriledge.</hi>
                  <q>The same Doctor had before undertaken a <hi>Defence</hi> of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his <hi>Reformed Catholick,</hi> calling him a man of very commendable quality, and well deserving, for his great travel and pains for the furtherance of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and edifying of the Church:</q>
which <hi>Reformed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> also is learnedly defended by Mr. <hi>Wotton.</hi> For a parting blow, the <hi>Doctor</hi> tells us that Mr. <hi>Perkins scarce lived out half his days:</hi> and that <hi>in the pangs of death, he spake nothing so articulately, as</hi> Mercy, mercy; <hi>which he hopes God did graciously grant him in that woful agony.</hi> And I for my part, do not at all doubt that God shewed him mercy, and had shewed him the very riches of his mercy many years before; for God is not unrighteous, that he should forget that labour of love with which Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> had laboured in <hi>Cambridge.</hi> As little do I doubt, that there are hundreds in Heaven blessing that Providence, that placed a light so shining and burning in that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity. His dying so soon is not to be imputed to his bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirstiness, or deceitfulness; but to his hard studies and unwearied diligence, which must needs wast his natural spirits, and bring him sooner to his grave than he would have come, if he could have satisfied himself (as some do) to enter into the Pulpit no oftner, than the High Priest entred into the Holy of Holies. He always desired that he might die praying for the pardon of sin, and he had his desire. If in his Sermon he <hi>pronounced the word</hi> damned
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40538:119"/>
                  <hi>with a more than ordinary Emphasis,</hi> it was only to forwarn his Hearers to flee from the wrath to come. If he <hi>so pressed the Law, as to make the hair of the young Scholars stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,</hi> it was only, that being awakened o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t of their secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they might seriously ask the question, How they should do to be saved? The Law was designed to be a School-master to bring us to Christ, and would not have that effect, if it should not be preached with some of that terror with which it was at first delivered. But <hi>he made the infinitely greatest part of all mankind uncapable of God's grace and mercy, by an absolute and irrespective decree of Reprobation.</hi> So it is said <hi>page</hi> 66. but no such thing can be proved out of Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s Writings. Had he framed any such decree as made any one man or woman uncapable of grace and mercy, he must needs have affrighted away his Disciples and Hearers: which he was so far from doing, that the <hi>Historian</hi> himself confesseth, that by means of him and Dr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> the University had been quite over-run with <hi>Calvinism,</hi> had not Dr. <hi>Baro,</hi> a French-man born, set himself to pluck up what the other two had planted and watered.</p>
               <p>Of this Dr. <hi>Baro</hi> we shall hear the <hi>Historian</hi> tell us a fine tale: <hi>Scilicet liberanda veritas expectabat liberatorem</hi> Petrum Baro, <hi>the English Kingdom of Heaven had fallen, had it not been for this</hi> Atlas <hi>that bare it up with his shoulders.</hi> Let us see what the man was, and what he held, that we may know how much we owe unto him; which yet we cannot well do, till we have taken in our way the story of one <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</hi> This <hi>Barret</hi> in a Sermon <hi>ad Clerum, April</hi> 29. 1595, had vented sundry <hi>Anticalvinistical</hi> Points, for which he was convented <hi>May</hi> 5. before the <hi>Heads of Houses,</hi> and charged to have preached Doctrines erroneous and false, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Religion received and established by publick Authority in the Realm of <hi>England.</hi> He confessed the Doctrines charged upon him, but denied them to be any way repugnant to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> and forenamed <hi>Heads,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into mature deliberation, and diligently weighing and examining these Positions; because it did manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the said Positions were false, erroneous, and likewise repugnant to the Religion received and established
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40538:120"/>
in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> adjudged and declared, that the said <hi>Barret</hi> had incurred the penalty of the 45th <hi>Statute</hi> of the University, <hi>de Concionibus:</hi> and, by virtue and tenour of that <hi>Statute,</hi> they decreed and adjudged the said <hi>Barret,</hi> to make a publick Recantation, in such words and form, as by the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> and the said <hi>Heads,</hi> or any three or two of them, should be prescribed unto him; or else upon his refusal to recant, to be perpetually expelled both from his <hi>Colledge</hi> and the <hi>University.</hi> What the form of Recantation was, may be seen in Mr. <hi>Prin</hi>; such it was, as gave sufficient honour unto <hi>Calvin, Peter Martyr,</hi> and the Doctrines Preached and Printed by them. Lo here we have those that were alwaies entrusted with power to judge of, and to condemn false Doctrine, condemning the <hi>Anti-Calvinistical</hi> opinions as false and contrary to the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Religion</hi> established in <hi>England.</hi> And when such an Authority has laid a Recantation upon Mr <hi>Barret,</hi> how will Dr. <hi>H.</hi> get it off? Why First, He doubts <hi>whether any Recantation were enjoyned in so many words as are extant in</hi> Mr. <hi>Prin.</hi> This is an irrational doubt; seeing Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> had the transcript under the <hi>University Register's</hi> own hand. Secondly, He denies it <hi>as a thing most false, that ever</hi> Barret <hi>published any Recantation, whatsoever it was.</hi> And yet Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> tells him that he had a transcript taken out of an Original copy under Mr. <hi>Barrets</hi> own hand; and tells us, as also does Mr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> what words he used after he had read the Recantation: and words they are from which it might be infer'd, that he was not heartily sorry for the errors delivered by him, nor really changed in his judgment. But <hi>doth it not appear by a Letter of the</hi> Heads of Houses <hi>dated March</hi> 8, that <hi>Mr.</hi> Barret <hi>had never made any such Recantation</hi>? I answer, It doth not appear; for the <hi>Heads of Houses</hi> say not, that he had never read the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, but that he had refused to do it in such sort as was prescribed: which might make those who were in Authority in the <hi>University,</hi> both to mind him of his duty, and also to complain of him unto their <hi>Chancellour</hi> for not doing his duty. Yet if it will do the <hi>Doctor</hi> a kindness, let him enjoy his fancy, that Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> Recanted not; for to be sure he did not credit his Recantation, returning to <hi>Arminianism</hi> and also to <hi>Popery,</hi> unto which the <hi>Heads
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40538:120"/>
of Houses</hi> say <hi>Arminianism</hi> had been by sundry made a Bridge. However here is the judgment of the <hi>Heads of Houses</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi> solemnly declared, that he who strikes at Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in these points, strikes at the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> also. <hi>Yea,</hi> sayes the Dr, <hi>but it will not hence follow that</hi> Barrets <hi>Doctrines were repugnant to the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>because these</hi> Heads <hi>judged them so: for if so, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by the same Argument, that the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>was in Light, in the Darkest times of ignorance and superstition; because all that publickly opposed her Doctrine were enjoyned Recantation.</hi> Which evasion is so lamentable, that he had much better have used none; for we do not from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning of the Recantation inferr the falsity of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to be recanted, but only their dissonance unto the Religion established: and certainly the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> when it was at the worst, did never injoyn Recantation of any Doctrine, which was not contrary unto her present sentiments. And so I leave Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> and his opinions under the blot justly dropped upon them by the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> only taking notice that <hi>Barrets</hi> peremptoriness might occasion <hi>Baro</hi> to deliver his mind more plainly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, than before he had done; which occasioned the <hi>University</hi> to send up Dr. <hi>Whitaker</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tindal</hi> unto Arch-Bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> hoping that he who had been so zealous against <hi>Cartwright</hi> in a point of Discipline, would be found to have some zeal against <hi>Baro</hi> in matter of Doctrine: nor did their hopes fail them; for he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with called to him sundry right worthy and Reverend Divines, and drew up those <hi>Articles</hi> commonly called the <hi>Lambeth-Articles,</hi> agreed upon <hi>November</hi> the 10th. 1595. nine they are in number, and were approved by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> as well as by his <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi> So that here are the two <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> men no doubt considerable for Learning as well as for Authority; for both of them had been Lady <hi>Margaret</hi>'s and <hi>King</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors in the University. Now I ask, Did these know the Doctrine of the <hi>Church,</hi> or did they not? If they did not, how durst they call men to subscribe what they knew not? If they did, then either <hi>Calvinism</hi> in this matter, is the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi>; or else the two <hi>Primates</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the <hi>University,</hi> a Doctrine against their own Light
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40538:121"/>
and conscience. And it is worth observation that the Bishop of <hi>York</hi> in his Letter to his Brother of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> does give him to understand, that his opinion he sent him concerning Election and Reprobation, was but that in which they had both agreed while they professed and taught Divinity in the <hi>Schools.</hi> Nor can it be said that <hi>Whitgift</hi> received his opinion from beyond the Seas, where he never was; having such favour shewed him by Doctor <hi>Perne,</hi> that he never needed to leave the Kingdom. More probable it is that he suckt in these opinions from his Tutor Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> and from Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> Master of <hi>Pembroke Hall,</hi> whilst he was a fresh-man. By whom also he was so principled against the tyranny and Detestable enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the Pope, that at the time of his commencing <hi>Dr. in Divinity,</hi> he gave this <hi>Thesis</hi> to be disputed on, <hi>Papa est Antichristus.</hi> Wherefore let not the <hi>Historian</hi> spend time to prove, that those <hi>Articles</hi> do not bind the <hi>Church</hi> as those did that solemnly passed in the <hi>Convocations</hi>; for I ascribe no such Authority to them, only urge them as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi>; just as I would urge the judgment of the two <hi>Lord Chief Iustices,</hi> calling in to their assistance others learned in the Law, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of a <hi>Statute</hi>: 'tis not impossible they should be mistaken in their exposition; but it would be strongly presumed by all modest men, that they were not mistaken. And so I could let go these <hi>Articles,</hi> had it not pleased the <hi>Historian</hi> to tell us, <hi>of a mighty offence taken at them by the Lord</hi> Burleigh, <hi>and a resolution of having all that acted in them attainted of a</hi> praemunire; <hi>from the danger of which the</hi> Arch-Bishop <hi>could not get release, until he had promised speedily to recall and suppress those Articles.</hi> All which we have laid down, <hi>page</hi> 81, 82, as things <hi>affirmed by Mr.</hi> Mountague, <hi>from the</hi> Remonstrants, <hi>in an Answer of theirs published,</hi> 1618. But where did these <hi>Remonstrants</hi> hear this story? <hi>Why, possibly they might have it from the mouth of</hi> Baro, <hi>or some other</hi> Cambridge <hi>men.</hi> Will any man believe so great things upon so slender proofs as the possibility of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants hearing them from the mouth of some <hi>Cantabridgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>? when they do not so much as pretend to have heard any such thing from any member of our <hi>Church,</hi> nor doth any one ever since offer to tell us when and where the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40538:121"/>
Arch-Bishop was forced to make any such submission? The <hi>Heads of Houses</hi> in their Letter to the <hi>Lord</hi> Burleigh, <hi>own the sending up of Dr.</hi> Tindal, <hi>and Dr.</hi> Whitaker, <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr with the Lord of</hi> Canterbury: <hi>and write of the great and comfortable quiet, that by the coming down of the</hi> Articles, <hi>was brought unto the</hi> University; <hi>until that</hi> Baro <hi>in</hi> January <hi>following, contrary to restraint and commandment, gave some new disturbance.</hi> In the same Letter also, subscribed with their names, and bearing date <hi>March</hi> 8. 1595, they reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely tell the same Lord; <hi>that</hi> Baro <hi>had determined, preached, printed diverse points of Doctrine, not only contrary to himself, but also contrary to that which had been taught and received ever since her</hi> Majesty's <hi>reign, and agreeable to the errours of</hi> Popery. <hi>Wherefore they pray his</hi> Lordship <hi>to vouchsafe his good ayd and advise to the comfort of themselves and all others of the</hi> Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>truly affected, and to the suppression, in time, of those errours, and even of gross</hi> Popery <hi>like by such means to creep in among them.</hi> And upon this Letter, or something else, <hi>Baro</hi> left his place in the <hi>University:</hi> because he could not keep it, say Dr. <hi>Ward,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> and all other <hi>Cantabridgians</hi> that ever I read; but this <hi>Oxford Historian,</hi> who can easily affirm any thing that he much desires, tells us he left his place, <hi>neither because he was deprived, nor because he had any fear of being deprived, but meerly because he had no mind to keep it any longer.</hi> Nay he sticks not to affirm that <hi>in case it had pleased him to continue any longer</hi> Lecturer, <hi>it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he might have carried the</hi> Lecture <hi>from any other Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate, or Competitour of what rate soever.</hi> But by what mediums did he bring himself to this probable perswasion, or whence did he collect that <hi>Baro</hi> had so great a number of adherents? Only from Dr. <hi>Overals being chosen to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> Dr. <hi>Whitaker.</hi> But if they were the <hi>Anti-calvinists</hi> that carried it for <hi>Overal,</hi> why did they not rather carry it for <hi>Baro</hi> himself, seeing they had such fair presidents of preferring those who are Lady <hi>Margarets</hi> Professors to be <hi>King's</hi> Professors? <hi>Hutton</hi> had been so preferred, so had <hi>Whitgift,</hi> so had <hi>Chaderton.</hi> Or if <hi>Baro</hi>'s interest were so great, how came he to use so little care and Conscience as not to provide a Successor of his own mind? Did he think his opinions were not worth the knowing: If he did not, why did he trouble the world with them? If he did,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40538:122"/>
why would he so tamely yield to the chusing of Doctor <hi>Playfer,</hi> than whom there was not a man in all the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</hi> more opposite to him? The truth is Doctor <hi>Overal</hi> had not then declared himself to differ from <hi>Calvin,</hi> and therefore was by the <hi>University</hi> employed to convince <hi>Barret:</hi> and afterwards when he delivered such things as some <hi>Calvinists</hi> condemned him for, yet he never deliver'd his mind so, as to deny personal election or the certain perseverance of all the elect. Something more of his mind we shall hear hereafter, in the <hi>Hampton-Court Conference.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time I must mind the <hi>Doctor</hi> of a certain <hi>Catechism,</hi> consisting of <hi>Questions</hi> and <hi>Answers</hi> touching the Doctrine of Predestination, bound up with our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Bibles,</hi> printed by <hi>Robert Barker, Anno</hi> 1607. but not then <hi>first</hi> bound up with our <hi>Bibles,</hi> as the <hi>Doctor</hi> seems willing to think, <hi>pag.</hi> 101, 102. The Questions and Answers are to be found in the Church <hi>Bibles,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Bishops <hi>Bibles</hi>: printed by <hi>Christopher Barker.</hi> I my self have seen <hi>Bibles</hi> printed twenty years before the coming in of King <hi>Iames,</hi> in which they were; and for ought I know they were as old as any Translation of the <hi>Bible</hi> used in Queen <hi>Elizabetbs</hi> time. He asks, <hi>by what authority those</hi> Questions <hi>and</hi> Answers <hi>were put in betwixt the Old and New Testament</hi>? and so I remember he somewhere asks, <hi>by what Authority the Metrical Translation of the</hi> Psalmes <hi>was allowed to be Sung in Churches</hi>? I am not able to give him a satisfactory answer either to the one or the other question; no more than he is able to answer me, who made our <hi>second</hi> Book of <hi>Homilies</hi>? Yet he thinks I suppose, that those who made that Book were Authorized to make it: and so I think, that those who first bound up those <hi>Questions</hi> and <hi>Answers</hi> and <hi>Singing Psalmes</hi> with our <hi>Bibles,</hi> had Order and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority so to do.</p>
               <p>All this while <hi>Cambridge</hi> hath took us up. We must now look into the other <hi>University,</hi> in which we are told that <hi>all things were calm and quiet, no publick opposition shewing it s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lf in the Schools or Pulpits.</hi> The reason of this quiet is guessed at, <hi>because the Students of that</hi> University <hi>did more incline to the canvasing of such Points as were in difference
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40538:122"/>
betwixt us, and the Romanists.</hi> For witness he calls in many Papists, and on the other side Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> Dr. <hi>Humphry,</hi> Mr. <hi>Nowel,</hi> Dr. <hi>Reynolds, and many others which stood firm to the Church of England.</hi> This last clause sure slipped from him unawares. Upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts I fear he will scarce affirm, that all these stood firm to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> If they did, no lot or portion hath he or any of his in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> most of them having declared their minds point blank against conditional election, <hi>&amp;c.

Five such <hi>Thesis</hi> as these, laid down by two such Scholars, were enough to let the new <hi>Pelagianizers</hi> see, there was no quarter for them in <hi>Oxford.</hi> Nor can I find, that they sought any; <hi>Calvin</hi> being there all Qu. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> days, in as much honour as at <hi>Geneva.</hi>

And of this the <hi>Historian</hi> seems sensible, confessing that even <hi>Barnabas</hi> was carried away into <hi>Calvinism:</hi> only he labours to prove, that <hi>it was but in one point, that of the not total or final falling away of Gods Elect.</hi> And that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the only point, for which Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> was quoted; but that is such a point as with which the other are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily twisted, and so defended by him as that he appears <hi>Calvinistical</hi> to the utmost. For whereas there be that maintain the certain perseverance of only the Elect, judging it not impossible that some might be believers who were not Elect, <hi>Hooker</hi> plainly makes all true believers Elect to eternal life, and therefore sure to persevere in the Faith; and he is so confident in this point as in none more, prefacing his assertion thus, <hi>In this I am sure I am not deceived, nor can I deceive you.</hi> At last the <hi>Doctor</hi> is faign to fly to this <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Seeing we have found <hi>Anti-calvinism</hi> discountenanced by the <hi>Church,</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign; let us now follow the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> to her Successors dayes, that we may see whether it were more countenanced then.</p>
               <p>The first thing we are led to <hi>Pag.</hi> 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, is the <hi>Hampton Court Conference:</hi> in which he shall find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him, but much against him. <hi>Dr.</hi> Reynolds <hi>calls the</hi> Lambeth <hi>Articles Orthodoxal:</hi> no one intimated that they were Heterodoxal. <hi>Dr.</hi> Overal <hi>declares against the total and final Apostasy of the Saints:</hi> no one declared for it. <hi>His</hi> Majesty <hi>determined, that Predestination and Election depend not upon any Qualities, actions, or works of Men, which be mutable; but upon Gods Eternal and immutable decree and purpose:</hi> no one said or whispered any thing
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40538:124"/>
against this determination 'Tis only said that the Bishop of <hi>London</hi> told his Majestie how <hi>very many in these daies, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Holiness of life, presumed too much of persisting in grace,</hi> (Calvinists would say, such fellows never had grace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in) <hi>laying all their Religion on Predestination,</hi> If I shall be saved, I shall be saved, <hi>which he termed a desperate Doctrine,</hi> (and so the <hi>Calvinists</hi> term it also an hundred times over;) <hi>shewing it to be contrary to good Divinity, and the true Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Predestination, wherein we should rather reason</hi> Ascendendo <hi>than</hi> Descendendo, <hi>thus; I live in obedience to God, in love to my Neighbour, I follow my occasion, &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I trust God hath elected me and predestinated me to eternal Salvation: not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, which is the usual course of argument, God hath predestinated and chosen me to life, therefore though I sin never so grievously, yet I shall not be damned; for whom he once loveth, he loveth to the End.</hi> In which words there is some thing <hi>Hypercalvinistical</hi>; for the <hi>Bishop</hi> saith, we must rather reason <hi>Ascendendo</hi> than <hi>Descendendo</hi>: but the <hi>Calvinist</hi> saith, that we must altogether reason <hi>Ascendendo,</hi> in such a way as he after delineates. If the <hi>Bishop</hi> were not a <hi>Calvinist,</hi> I would fain know how a man could, according to his principles, argue <hi>Ascendendo, I live in obedience to God,</hi> therefore <hi>I trust God hath elected me and predestinated me to Salvation.</hi> The <hi>Calvinist</hi> saith, <hi>he that lives in obedience to God is predestinated to Salvation:</hi> but so doth not the <hi>Anti-calvinist,</hi> nor hath he any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build his trust of Predestination to Salvation upon; for, according to him, a man who lives in all good obedience to God may be damned, because he may cease to live in obedience to God, and hath no promise that he shall not cease.</p>
               <p>But if Dr. <hi>Bancroft</hi> had not by his speech declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>Calvinistical</hi>; yet, as hath been said, his <hi>Chaplain's</hi> publishing his <hi>Exposition</hi> or <hi>Analysis</hi> of our <hi>Articles,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Calvinistical</hi> frame, and that with his good liking and approbation, is a sufficient argument that he was such. To invalidate this argument it is only said, that <hi>That</hi> Analysis <hi>had been published</hi> 1585, <hi>which was eighteen years before</hi> Bancroft <hi>was Arch-Bishop.</hi> Which answer adds strength to the argument; for by it it appears, that he took one to be his <hi>Chaplain,</hi> who had eighteen years before pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished

a <hi>Calvinistical</hi> Exposition of the <hi>Articles,</hi> and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him after his own Consecration to republish it, and to dedicate it to his own Grace: which it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, he would not have done, if it had contained any thing contrary to his own judgement and sense.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But <hi>why would any one affirm, that</hi> Bancroft <hi>agreed to the</hi> Lambeth-Articles, <hi>whilst Bishop of</hi> London?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It was Mr. <hi>Fullers</hi> mistake, in his <hi>Church History,</hi> so to affirm. Mr. <hi>Hickman,</hi> whom the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath chosen for his adversary, never so affirmed. Yet he affirmed, that he <hi>agreed to them:</hi> and so it is like he did, in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of a Divine called in to consult. On which score I also reckon that Mr. <hi>Nowel</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> might agree to them; because he was Dr. <hi>Whitakers</hi> Unkle and resided at <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. 2. <hi>Did not King</hi> James <hi>reject the</hi> Lambeth Articles, <hi>when propounded as fit to be inserted into the</hi> Articles?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> He did not reject them, nor could he in honour reject them; having never seen them before, nor having them read to him at that time. He was only told, that the <hi>Articles</hi> were by the <hi>Arch-Bishop,</hi> taking to him some Divines of special note, drawn up and sent to the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> for the appeasing of quarrels. Whereupon his <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty</hi> resolved, that <hi>when such questions do arise among Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the quietest proceeding were, to determine them in the</hi> University, <hi>and not to stuff the Book with Conclusions Theological.</hi> Here is not one word of leaving them to be canvased and disputed in the Schools: though if they had been so left, they might not forthwith be held in the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative</hi> or <hi>Negative,</hi> as best pleased the <hi>Respondent</hi>; for the <hi>Respondent</hi> in our <hi>Universities</hi> can hold nothing without the allowance and approbation of the <hi>Doctor of the Chair,</hi> or <hi>Vice-Chancelor,</hi> or <hi>University.</hi> Yea King <hi>Iames</hi> did, some years after, allow the putting of these <hi>Lambeth-Articles</hi> into the <hi>Confession</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Anno 1615. To this the <hi>Doctor</hi> shapes an answer, <hi>pag.</hi> 101, consisting of sundry particulars.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That the Irish Articles were drawn up by Dr.</hi> Usher <hi>a professed Calvinian, who not only thrust in the</hi> Lambeth-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, <hi>but also made others of his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:40538:125"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Articles are the better to be liked because drawn up by a hand so learned and peaceable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the</hi> King <hi>might give consent to the confirming of these Articles, though he liked them not.</hi> How so? First, <hi>Because the Irish Nation, at that time, were most tenaciously addicted to the errors and corruptions of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and therefore must be bended to the other extreme, before they could be streight.</hi> Secondly, <hi>It was an usual practise with the</hi> King <hi>in the whole course of his government, to ballance one extreme by another; countenancing the</hi> Papists <hi>against the</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, <hi>and the</hi> Puritans <hi>sometimes against the</hi> Papists.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I have heard much talk of the craft of King <hi>Iames</hi>; but did never before hear, nor do I now believe, that this was any part of it: for what Policy is it, to bring People out of one extreme into another? or what Piety is it, to agree to <hi>Articles of Religion,</hi> the which all the <hi>Clergy</hi> must approve, meerly to keep the civil interest even? But I see what the <hi>Doctors</hi> fetch is in this; what ever King <hi>Iames</hi> did in the affairs of Religion that his palat relisheth not, must be thought to be done to gratifie the <hi>Puritans:</hi> may not the <hi>Puritans</hi> also say, that what ever was done pleasing to the <hi>Doctor,</hi> was done in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the <hi>Papists?</hi> and with whom then will the name of King <hi>Iames</hi> be precious or honourable?</p>
               <p>One piece of veracity I must needs commend the <hi>Doctor</hi> for, viz. <hi>his acknowledging that Dr.</hi> Reynolds <hi>owned the meaning of the sixteenth</hi> Article <hi>to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ound, pag.</hi> 98. This I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, because Mr. <hi>Mountague</hi> found a forehead, in his <hi>Appeal,</hi> to aver that <hi>it was by him and the other Ministers challenged for unsound.</hi> I wish I had the like occasion to commend him for veracity to the end of his Book? But I have not; for <hi>pag.</hi> 103, he tells us, <hi>that the opposites to the</hi> Calvinians <hi>were by the grace and favour of King</hi> James <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested in the chief preferments of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as openly and freely upon them as those who had been bred up in the contrary perswasion.</hi> This if it be understood of men that had openly declared their opinions against the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrine, will be found to be an untruth. If any trust be to be given to our printed Catalogues of Bishops, there were in that Kings Reign these Translations, or Consecrations. Canterbury, <hi>Richard Bancroft,</hi> 1604. <hi>G.

How few are they among these which the <hi>Doctor</hi> layes claim to?

that his Conditional-decree-men <hi>found King</hi> James <hi>a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Patron, and by means of his gracious Patronage, in the end surmounted all difficulties, and came at last to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as considerable, both for power and number, as the</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinists <hi>were.</hi>

<q>For why might not King <hi>Iames</hi> charge the <hi>Remonstrants</hi> with <hi>Vorstius</hi> his blasphemies, when as they so apertly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they had nothing against <hi>Vorstius,</hi> nor had found any thing in his Writing which was contrary to truth or piety: and that it would be most profitable to Church and Commonwealth, if his calling should proceed?</q>

               <p>Sir, I beseech you consider whether you do not contradict your self, whilst you think you only contradict <hi>Calvin. Universal redemption by the death of Christ overthrows the whole</hi> Machine <hi>of the</hi> Calvinian <hi>predestination and the points thereon depending.</hi> Thus I argue from this, <hi>They that were sent with Order to assert Universal redemption by the death of Christ, were sent with order to destroy the whole</hi> Machine <hi>of</hi> Calvinian <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination. Our Divines by King</hi> James <hi>were sent with Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to assert Universal redemption by the death of Christ.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Our Divines were sent with Orders to destroy the whole</hi> Machine <hi>of</hi> Calvinian <hi>predestination.</hi> Again, <hi>They that asserted Universal re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our Divines at the Synod of</hi> Dort, <hi>asserted Universal Redemption by the death of Christ.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Our Divines at the Synod of</hi> Dort, <hi>destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole</hi> Machine <hi>of the</hi> Calvinian <hi>predestination.</hi> The premises in both Syllogisms are your own. Yet I suppose you disown the conclusion, naturally and necessarily flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them: Or if you do not, why did you say, that <hi>our King thought it a piece of King-Craft to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the suppression of the weaker,</hi> i. e. Remonstrant <hi>party, and sent Divines that would be active in their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, you tell us that <hi>this point of Universal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, was, together with the rest, condemned in the Synod of</hi> Dort.</p>
               <p>Now nothing was in that Synod condemned, but what our Divines consented to: they have subscribed to all the determinations of the Synod, relating to the death of Christ: Therefore either the Synod <hi>did not condemn Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal redemption,</hi> of our Divines <hi>did not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:40538:128"/>The <hi>Reader,</hi> by this time sees what terrible executions the <hi>Doctor</hi> hath done on himself: and more need not be said about the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> as it relateth to our <hi>English</hi> affairs.</p>
               <p>Some things done in <hi>England,</hi> and misrelated by the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> must be rectified. <hi>Pag.</hi> 105, he essays to make a Salve for the Recantation imposed on Mr. <hi>Sympson,</hi> for some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in a <hi>Sermon</hi> before the <hi>King,</hi> at <hi>Royston,</hi> 1616, and he would fain have us think, that <hi>the</hi> King <hi>took no offence at his saying, that the committing any great Sin did for the present ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish grace, and Gods Spirit; for in that he went no further than</hi> Overal <hi>had done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is very untrue; for <hi>Overal</hi> never said so, nor could say so, according to his principles. But what then did the <hi>King</hi> take exception at?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At nothing but the Preachers expounding the seventh to the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>as</hi> Arminius <hi>had done, or rather, his Fathering the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition on</hi> Arminius.</p>
               <p>But either the <hi>Preacher</hi> did bring this exposition of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi> to credit an <hi>Arminian</hi> notion, or he did not. If he did, then it was the <hi>Arminianism</hi> of the exposition that gave distast. If not, would it not sound like tyranny in the <hi>King,</hi> to injoyn a Learned man a Recantation, meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he used such an exposition of a place of Scripture as <hi>Arminius</hi> had used?</p>
               <p>Take the place of a Regenerate man, <hi>Arminius</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine cannot stand, as the wise <hi>King</hi> well saw; and therefore he sent to the two <hi>Professors</hi> of <hi>Cambridge</hi> to have their judgment in the case, who sent their judgment in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of St. <hi>Austins</hi> exposition.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Doctor</hi> observes, that <hi>the Professors did not do this of their own Authority, but as set on by the King, pag.</hi> 106.</p>
               <p>I wonder how they could give their judgments to the <hi>King</hi> at <hi>Royston,</hi> of a Sermon Preached before him, until they were by his <hi>Majesty</hi> required so to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I, But the</hi> Professors <hi>were not so forward as to move in it of themselves; as may appear by their not answering of</hi> Tompsons <hi>Book,</hi> de intercisione gratiae &amp; justificationis, <hi>though the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it were a member of that</hi> University, <hi>but leaving it to be co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

great an alteration had been made in</hi> Cambridge, <hi>since the first striking up of their heats against</hi> Baro, <hi>and</hi> Barret.</p>
               <p>O what superfoetations of Doctrines are here upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or what is less than nothing? First, Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi> when he confuted <hi>Tompson,</hi> was not <hi>Doctor of the Chair</hi> but <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and so no Brother to the <hi>Professors</hi> at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> 1616. Secondly, The <hi>Professors</hi> at <hi>Cambridge</hi> then, were Dr. <hi>Richardson</hi> originally of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> a Colledge that in those days afforded few <hi>Arminians</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Iohn Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> a very able and zealous opposer of <hi>Arminianism,</hi> as all know. Thirdly, The <hi>Cambridge Professors</hi> might not count themselves concerned to confute <hi>Tompson,</hi> because his Book was not Printed in their <hi>University,</hi> nor indeed in <hi>England,</hi> and because <hi>Tompson</hi>'s life had confuted his Book at <hi>Cambridge.</hi> He was a man of a most debauched conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and confirmed himself in his debauchedness, by his <hi>Arminianism</hi>; for when men reproved him for his propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he would say <hi>My will is free, I am a Child of the Devil to day, to morrow I will make my self a Child of God:</hi> this more than any Answer to the Book, would confirm the <hi>Cantabridgians,</hi> that he was not an enemy to perseverance as a Doctrine leading to impiety.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Well, but <hi>Did not King</hi> James, <hi>by his Directions to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity,</hi> Jan. 18. 1619. <hi>require that</hi> young students in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity be appointed to study such Books, as be most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Doctrine and discipline to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and excited to bestow their time in the Fathers, and Councels, School-men, Histories, and Controversies: and not to insist too long upon Compendiums, and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviations, making them the ground of their study in Divinity?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Really he did so, and I heartily wish the direction had been observed: for then had <hi>Arminianism</hi> been crushed in the shell. I think next to the study of the Holy Scriptures, the reading of the Fathers is the best preservative against <hi>Arminianism</hi>; which came into the <hi>Low-countrys</hi> with the contempt of the Fathers. As for <hi>Calvinism,</hi> it cannot be condemned, if sentence be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon it out of the Fathers; those I mean, who professed to set themselves, to handle the Controversies
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:40538:129"/>
concerning grace and predestination. Sure I am the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al directions</hi> notwithstanding, the <hi>University</hi> continued as highly, or more highly <hi>Calvinistical</hi> than ever: a manifest argument that the <hi>University</hi> looked upon the <hi>Kings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,</hi> as no way tending to root out <hi>Calvinistical</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but rather as a means to confirm it, and so indeed they were.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> will not yet give over, but, <hi>pag.</hi> 108, tells us of <hi>certain Orders sent out, Anno</hi> 1622, <hi>August the fourth, designed to put a bridle into the</hi> Calvinists <hi>mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Orders</hi> it is notoriously known were put out at such a time when the <hi>Spanish</hi> match was driving on, and common people began to have thoughts of heart whither the releasing of Recusants, and the Articles of Marriage might tend.
<q>In those <hi>Orders</hi> care was taken, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, that no undecent expressions should be used against <hi>Puritanes</hi>; but it was also provided that no Preacher of what title soever under the degree of a Bishop or Dean at least, should thenceforth presume to teach in any popular auditory, the deep points of predestination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but rather leave those points to be handled by learned men, and that modestly and moderately, by Use and application rather than by positive Doctrine.</q>
And this was a right good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for <hi>Calvinists,</hi> who never suffer so much from any thing, as the declamatory attempts of men in <hi>popular Sermons.</hi> In the <hi>Schools,</hi> where Syllogisms must be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, their Doctrine is not in much danger; because he who disputes must keep himself close to the State of the Question, through not representing of which, <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> get all their Advantage. Mr. <hi>Hoard</hi> did make choice of that piece of <hi>Calvinism</hi> which is most liable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the <hi>absolute decree of reprobation.</hi> And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, when I was a young proud <hi>Graduate,</hi> I had read his Book, and did think it perfectly unanswerable: but when I had the good hap to meet with Bishop <hi>Dav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nants</hi> answer to it, I was marvelously altered in my opinion and estimation concerning the strength of the <hi>Book,</hi> (keeping still an high opinion of the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40538:129"/>
                  <hi>Author</hi> of it;) for I found that the <hi>absolute decree of reprobation</hi> was quite another thing than it was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented.</p>
               <p>There was in <hi>Oxford,</hi> after the coming out of the aforesaid <hi>Orders</hi> of the King, a Sermon Preached in the <hi>University</hi> Church by Mr. <hi>Gabriel Bridges,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the absolute decree: <hi>this,</hi> saith the Doctor, <hi>was a violating of the Kings Order,</hi> (you must pity him, he had nothing else to say,) <hi>and this laid him open to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of Dr.</hi> Prideaux, <hi>and to the censure of the</hi> Vice-chancelor.</p>
               <p>But all who have searched the <hi>Register</hi> do know, that violation of the <hi>Kings Order</hi> was never so much as once laid to Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi> his charge. He was accused for Preaching contrary to the <hi>Articles of Religion</hi> established among us: and was Ordered to maintain in the Schools, the Contrary to what he had Preached in the Pulpit: and he did so, and never altered his mind afterwards. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it had been most ridiculous once to imagine, that a Sermon Preached in the <hi>University</hi> Church, could violate the <hi>Kings Order</hi> manifestly restrained to <hi>popular Auditories,</hi> in which number the <hi>University Auditories</hi> were never placed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> hath one Card more left to play, which if it hit not, he will have a perfect Slam. What is that? It is his dear friend Mr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> whom he imagineth in his Gagger <hi>to have disclaimed all the</hi> Calvinian <hi>tenents, and to have asserted the</hi> Church <hi>to her primitive and genuine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</hi>

the <hi>Arminians</hi> that he might save the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and Archbishop <hi>Abbot</hi> coming not at him, and Dr. <hi>Iames Mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue</hi> being dead,) <hi>was Master of himself,</hi> (it seems before he had been a servant to others,) <hi>and Governed by the Light of his own most clear and excellent judgement, took both</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague <hi>and his Doctrines into his Protection, and gave him a</hi> quietus est <hi>from all those Calumnies of</hi> Popery <hi>and</hi> Arminian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism <hi>that were by the Informers laid on him, commanded Dr.</hi> Francis White <hi>to see his</hi> Appeal <hi>he was in hand with Licenced for the Press, and finally gave Order to</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague <hi>to dedicate the Book, when Licenced, to his Royal self.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things are very unlikely; that a King should give command to have a Book Licenced before he had seen it or knew what would be in it, and that he should give Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to have it Dedicated to himself: and because they are unlikely, I could be glad to see them confirmed by some irrefragable Authority; but find no Authority al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. Wherefore I am a very unbeliever in all these matters: so are most I meet with. But these things I am certain of, First, That in Mr. <hi>Mountagues Appeal</hi> there be down-right untruths in matter of fact; in which I do not find the <hi>Doctor</hi> going about to justifie or excuse him. Secondly, That never Book gave more discontent than his did; for it was answered by no fewer than five or six, all considerable in the Nation, all agreeing that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Doctrine of the <hi>Church.</hi> The Book was also censured in Parliament, as contrary to our <hi>Articles.</hi> Archbishop <hi>Abbot</hi> indeavoured the stopping of it before it came to light. Dr. <hi>White</hi> who had approved it, did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly complain what a trick the Bishops had served him, promising to joyn with him in the approbation of the Book, but yet cowardly slipping their necks out of the Collar and leaving him to bear the whole envy of the Midwifery of so distastful a Book. Finally, King <hi>Charles</hi> himself, was feign both to pardon <hi>Mountague</hi> for all his Writings, and at last to call in his Book, as the great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of many unneces<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I Am given to understand, that I seem to some, not sufficiently to have taken notice of what the <hi>Doctor</hi> brings, to invalidate the Argument drawn from <hi>Barret</hi>'s Recantation. I drew the Argument from the <hi>Heads of Houses</hi> in <hi>Cambridge</hi> enjoyning Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> to Recant what he had delivered against absolute reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and against perseverance, and some other <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines, not only as false but also as contrary to the <hi>Articles of Religion</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> established. The <hi>Doctor</hi> doth not, cannot deny, but that such Recantation was enjoyned him. Now if the <hi>Heads of Houses</hi> in the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> who are authorized to judge of the Sermons preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, and to censure what they find in such Sermons disagreeable to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church,</hi> did judge <hi>Barret</hi>'s Doctrine, denying absolute reprobation and perseverance of Believers, to be contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church,</hi> and manifestly contrary to it, and passed this judgment upon mature deliberation, I leave it to any ones consideration, whether this be not a very vehement presumption, that <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Doctrine concerning absolute election and perseverance is agreeable to the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Barret</hi>'s Doctrine contrary to them. If this be granted, what need I contend about by-passages relating to the Recantation, being in a place where I can have no recourse to the <hi>Records</hi> of <hi>Cambridge</hi>?

then no <hi>Heads</hi> but what were <hi>Calvinistical,</hi> and no man can think that they should all be guided and acted by Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> a poor Preacher in the Town. 2. <hi>It is to be doubted,</hi> saith he, <hi>pag.</hi> 71, <hi>whether any such Recantation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of so many Articles, and every Article having its abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or recantation subjoyned unto it, was ever enjoyned to be made?</hi> But what reason have we to doubt of this? when as the Form of Recantation is exemplified in Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> (from whom I had it,) and also in Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>'s <hi>Antiarminianism,</hi> and was fairly printed in Qu. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s daies, some printed Copies of it being still extant, and seeing Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> declares that the Form of Recantation by him inserted into his Book, was a Transcript taken out of an Original Copy under Mr. <hi>Barret</hi>'s own hand? Why he doubts, <hi>because though Mr.</hi> Prynne <hi>say, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, in the same manner and form as we there find it, was exemplified and sent unto him under the</hi> Register's <hi>hand, yet he also confesseth, that no such matter could be found when the</hi> Heads of houses <hi>were required by an Order from the</hi> House of Commons <hi>to make certificate unto them of all such Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as were recorded in their</hi> University Register, <hi>and of this Recantation in particular.</hi> But first, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> only tells us, that he had been certified and informed, that this Order for Recantation could not be found among the <hi>University</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. 2. Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> doth not pretend to have had in his hands the Form of Recantation exemplified under the <hi>Register's</hi> hand, but only the Order for Recantation. The Form of Recantation he tells us, he had another way; and perhaps the Form of Recantation was never put into the <hi>University Archives,</hi> or <hi>Register.</hi> But if the Order for the Recantation should not be found there neither, I should much wonder, and yet less wonder, because <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> who was <hi>Register</hi> at this time, is branded for one that was very careless in Registring matters that concerned the <hi>University</hi>; as may be found in Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi>'s Hist. of <hi>Camb.</hi> p. 49.</p>
            <p>But that which the <hi>Historian</hi> most contends for, is, that the Recantation was never made by <hi>Barret.</hi> Pag. 72. <hi>It is to be denied as a thing most false, that he never published the Recantation, whatsoever it was.</hi> It is to be thought that the Printer hath mistaken his Copy, and put <hi>never,</hi> instead
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40538:132"/>
of <hi>ever</hi>; for if it be most false that he never published his Recantation, then it is to be affirmed as a thing most true, that he sometime published it: which is that which we believe Let us s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an the reasons of the <hi>Doctor</hi> to prove that he never read the Recantation, <hi>ibid. For</hi> 1. <hi>It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in Mr.</hi> Prynnes <hi>own Transcript of the Acts, that though</hi> Barret <hi>did confess the Propositions wherewith he was charged, to be contained in his Sermon, yet he would never grant them to be contrary to the Doctrine of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>and therefore was not likely to retract the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Argument framed stands thus,</p>
            <p>
               <q>He that would never acknowledge his Propositions to be contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was not likely to retract the same. Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> would not acknowledge his Propositions to be contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>: therefore, he was not likely to retract the same.</q>
The <hi>Major</hi> certainly is most absurdly false; but the <hi>Minor</hi> cannot be proved. For Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>'s Copy doth not say, that <hi>he would never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge</hi>; but only that <hi>at first reading of his Charge he denyed</hi> his Propositions to be contrary to the Religion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Many a man at first denies what he afterwards granteth. Secondly, saith the <hi>Doctor,</hi> ibid. <hi>It is plain from</hi> Mr. <hi>Barret</hi>'s Letters, <hi>the one to Dr.</hi> Goad <hi>Master of</hi> Kings, <hi>the other to Mr.</hi> Chadderton <hi>Master of</hi> Emanuel, <hi>that neither slattery, nor t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ings, nor the fear of losing his subsistence in the</hi> University, <hi>should ever work him to the publishing of the Recantation required of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctor</hi> had in his <hi>Certamen Epistolare</hi> before told us of two <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Barret</hi>'s, written one to Dr. <hi>Goad,</hi> the other to Mr. <hi>Chadderton</hi>; and now he tells us that from them it is manifest that neither flattery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet he gives us only a Copy of the <hi>Letter</hi> to Dr. <hi>Goad,</hi> and never tells us whence he had that; nor doth the <hi>Letter</hi> to Dr. <hi>Goad</hi> in the least intimate that any flattery had been used to draw him to make the Recantation; but rather it manifests that he used flattery to perswade Dr. <hi>Goad</hi> to be his Friend, and obtain for him, that he might stay in the <hi>University,</hi> on solemn promise to keep his Opinion to himself. A very <hi>sneaking Letter</hi> it is, and shews that he was a poor low spirited man, valuing his Place more than his Conscience,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40538:132"/>
and yet his Credit more than his Place. Nor doth he (if we may judge of him by the <hi>Letter</hi> pretended to be his,) appear to be a toberable Scholar. For let any one read the beginning of it, and he will scarce be able to find sense in it. <hi>My duty remembred to your Worship, &amp;c.</hi> Sir, <hi>according to your appointment I have conferred with Mr.</hi> Overald, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Chadderton. <hi>Mr.</hi> Overald <hi>after once Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, refused to talk any more off these points, saying it needed not. For Mr.</hi> Chadderton <hi>he is a learned man, and one whom I do much reverence, yet he hath not satisfied me in this point: for I required proof but of these two things at his hands: that</hi> una fides <hi>did</hi> specie differre ab alia; <hi>and that it was</hi> aliud donum ab alio. <hi>But for the first, whereas he should have proved it did was</hi> differre specie, <hi>he proved it did</hi> differre numero, <hi>and that but out of the</hi> Master of the Sentences; <hi>whose authority notwithstanding I do not impugne. And for the other, that it should be</hi> aliud donum, <hi>he proveth out of St.</hi> Augustin <hi>that</hi> fides daemonum <hi>is not</hi> alia a fide Christiano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, <hi>which no man ever denyed; for</hi> fides daemonum <hi>is not</hi> donum <hi>at all; so that it cometh not in question. So that I being unsatisfied of one party</hi> (<hi>meaning Mr.</hi> Chadderton) <hi>and rather confirmed of the other party, I do hold my Positions as before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He, (if he) saith, <hi>he required proof but of two things,</hi> viz. <hi>that</hi> una fides <hi>did</hi> differre specie ab alia, <hi>and that it was</hi> aliud donum ab alio. That <hi>it</hi> was; that <hi>what</hi> was? <hi>Una fides.</hi> Can any one make sense of this, <hi>Una fides est aliud donum ab alio?</hi> I must confess I cannot. But what success had he in his desire to Mr. <hi>Chadderton</hi>? Why, <hi>whereas he should have proved that</hi> una fides <hi>did</hi> differre specie ab alia, <hi>he proved it did</hi> differre numero; <hi>and that but out of the</hi> Master of the Sentences, <hi>whose authority nevertheless,</hi> he saith, <hi>he did not impugne.</hi> Really I think he did not disgrace himself in granting upon the authority of the <hi>Master of the Sentences,</hi> that <hi>una fides</hi> doth <hi>differre numero ab alia:</hi> but Mr. <hi>Chad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derton</hi> did vilely disgrace himself, if he did bring the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Sentences</hi> authority, to prove that <hi>una fides nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mero di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fert ab alia.</hi> He might even as well have brought the authority of the <hi>Master of the Sentences,</hi> to prove that Mr. <hi>Chadderton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> did <hi>differre numero.</hi> But why was Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> so simple, as to desire to have it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40538:133"/>
proved, that <hi>Una fides</hi> doth <hi>specie differre ab alia?</hi> Could he once imagine that divine and humane faith do not <hi>specie differre?</hi> or did he not know that the faith of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles did specifically differ from that by which we are justified? If any man would be satisfied that even the faith which is commonly called temporary, doth specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally differ from that to which salvation is promised, he may soon be satisfied by reading the writings that passed betwixt Dr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> concerning this point. Did Mr. <hi>Chadderton</hi> satisfie any better his second desire? (which I for my part cannot understand.) Of that thus he writeth. <hi>And for the other that it should be</hi> aliud donum, <hi>he proveth out of</hi> St. Austin <hi>that</hi> fides daemonum <hi>is not</hi> alia a fide Christianorum: <hi>which no man ever denied, for</hi> fides daemonum <hi>is not</hi> donum <hi>at all, so that it cometh not in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</hi> This is the strangest stuff I ever met with. Did Mr. <hi>Ch.</hi> prove out of St. <hi>Austin</hi> that <hi>fides daemonum</hi> is not <hi>alia a fide Christianorum,</hi> and did no man ever deny this, and is this a good reason to prove that no man denied it, because <hi>fides daemonum</hi> is not <hi>donum</hi>? Either this is non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense or I have lost my reason and senses. In the Form of Recantation I find it enjoyned Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> to recant this saying <hi>In fide nulla est distinctio sed in credentibus.</hi> Which undoubtedly was unworthy of a Scholar; for what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction could he mean, specifical or numerical? If spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical, then his meaning must be, <hi>Una fides non distinguitur specie ab alia, sed unus fidelis specifice distinguitur ab alio:</hi> If numerical, then his meaning must be, <hi>Una fides non differt numerice ab alia, se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> unus fidelis differt numerice ab alio:</hi> which was rare stuff to put into a Sermon <hi>ad Clerum.</hi> If there be no difference in Faiths, there can be no difference in Believers as such, that's certain. I believe this muddy <hi>Letter</hi> made Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> himself somewhat muddy: for <hi>pag.</hi> 75, he lets us know <hi>that it cannot be made apparent that either Dr.</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>the</hi> Vicechancellor, <hi>which was most concerned, or Dr.</hi> Baro <hi>the Lady</hi> Margarets <hi>Professor for Divinity there, had any hand in sentencing the Recantation. Not Dr.</hi> Baro <hi>because by concurring to this Sentence, he was to have condemned himself</hi>: (he might also have added because being no <hi>Head of an House,</hi> he could not sit among the <hi>Heads of Houses.</hi>) But, Why not Dr. <hi>Duport? For I find his Place to be supplied by
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40538:133"/>
Dr.</hi> Some, <hi>which shews him to be absent at that time from the</hi> University, <hi>according to the stile whereof the title of</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancellarius <hi>is given to Dr.</hi> Some <hi>in the Acts of the Court; as appears by the extracts of them in the</hi> Antiarminianism, p. 64, <hi>compared with</hi> p. 63. Did I ghess amiss in saying the <hi>Doctor</hi> was muddy when he writ this? Could Dr. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> be most concerned to sentence the Recantation, if he were absent from the <hi>University</hi> when the Sentence was given? Doth the managing of the business by Doctor <hi>Some</hi> shew, that Dr. <hi>Duport</hi> was absent from the <hi>University</hi> at the management of it? Might he not be in the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> and be sick, or or otherwise hindred from coming to the <hi>University</hi> Consistory. Finally, it seems by Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>'s Transcript that though Dr. <hi>Some</hi> did as Deputy manage some part of the Transaction, yet Dr. <hi>Duport</hi> himself ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged at least the latter part of it. I had almost forgot to take notice of one thing the <hi>Doctor</hi> brings to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the Recantation <hi>page</hi> 73. It is <hi>the Title of it, given by Mr.</hi> Prynne <hi>page</hi> 50, <hi>Antiarm.</hi> And really, had that Title been given to it by the <hi>University,</hi> it had been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to disparage the whole Recantation. But Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> doth not affirm that Title to be made by any but himself; who being a long-winded wordy man, and as fierce against the <hi>Arminians</hi> as the <hi>Doctor</hi> can be for them could not mention Mr. <hi>Barret</hi>'s errors without shewing his detestation, of them and Mr. <hi>Harsnet</hi> who held them as well as Mr. <hi>Barret.</hi> To conclude, I hope, for Mr. <hi>Barret</hi>'s sake, that he never did write so silly a <hi>Letter</hi> to Dr. <hi>Goad</hi>: If he did, I cannot collect from it that he never read the Recantation enjoyned him. And I wish for Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s sake that he had not depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated <hi>the invincible constancy of Mr.</hi> Barret, as he doth <hi>page</hi> 87: and that he had used his art, rather any other way, than to put a fair face on foul Opinions. And for <hi>my self,</hi> I desire thee Good <hi>Reader</hi> to believe, that as I took but little pleasure in writing against Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> whilst he lived; so I take less to find any thing of mine printed against him since he is dead. If by what thou readest, thou be any way edified, give God the glory, and me thy prayers.</p>
