            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>You know we have had a Long and Bloody War, Gentlemen: and the same Actions which on the <hi>Legal side,</hi> were <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Piety,</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> were in the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Party,</hi> no other then <hi>Rapine, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion.</hi> These <hi>Crimes</hi> call for <hi>Repentance,</hi> and either <hi>Christianity</hi> is but a <hi>story,</hi> or it concerns those People that have This Load upon their <hi>Consciences, frankly,</hi> and <hi>seasonably</hi> to <hi>discharge</hi> themselves.</p>

               <hi>As to the</hi> Rest, <hi>I think a</hi> private List <hi>presented to his</hi> Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, <hi>were a</hi> Good <hi>and a</hi> Loyal piece of service: <hi>as</hi> ('tis, <hi>and ever</hi> was <hi>my</hi> judgment) <hi>it were the</hi> contrary <hi>to make it</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, <hi>for</hi> that <hi>were to</hi> invade an Act of Parliament, <hi>to</hi> assault <hi>the</hi> Party. <hi>Whereas the</hi> other <hi>is (as I understand it) onely a</hi> dutiful <hi>and</hi> modest office <hi>toward his</hi> Majesty.</p>
            <p>General Rules <hi>have their</hi> Exceptions; <hi>and beyond doubt,</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars there are, whom they that plac'd them there, would not his Majesty should take notice of. <hi>Neither do I</hi> presume <hi>to</hi> blame <hi>even</hi> Those, <hi>but I</hi> propose <hi>to</hi> shew <hi>them.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>If Services of</hi> this <hi>Quality be rendred</hi> dangerous, <hi>'tis onely for those people that are weary of their</hi> Lives, <hi>to be</hi> Honest; <hi>and I'l content my self still to be</hi> one <hi>of them.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>One</hi> Note, <hi>and I have done. My Crime is not the raking into</hi> pardon'd Actions, <hi>but for</hi> exposing Relapsers, <hi>and</hi> discovering new Combinations.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome <hi>Thousands</hi> of these <hi>Fire-balls,</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready thrown among the <hi>Common People</hi> by the <hi>Reformado Presbyters,</hi> and 'tis their way; First to Preach, the Rabble to <hi>Gunpowder</hi>; and then scatter their <hi>Squibs</hi> among them. There is neither <hi>Author, Stationer,</hi> nor <hi>Printer,</hi> that appears to the Pamphlet: but the Design is <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi>; and That's the Reason they're asham'd to own it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49955:7"/>If my Intelligence deceives me not; this same <hi>Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal piece of Holynesse,</hi> was delivered to the Presse by one Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> or by his <hi>Order. Ibbitson</hi> in <hi>Smithfield</hi> was the <hi>Printer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Birds of a Feather.</note> (The <hi>Levelling Ibbitson</hi> I suppose; he that Printed the <hi>Adjutators Proposals,</hi> I mean, and <hi>The</hi> PETITION TO THE ARMY AGAINST THE MAIOR AND ALDERMEN in <hi>October</hi> 1647.) I am told too that <hi>R. W.</hi> has a Finger in the Pye; — <hi>Brittanicus</hi> his old Friend; — he that hunts in Couples with <hi>Tyton.</hi> These good Folks have Printed <hi>Treason</hi> so long, that they think now they do the King a <hi>Kindnesse,</hi> to <hi>stop</hi> at <hi>Sedition.</hi> Indeed 'tis pitty their old <hi>Imprimatur-man</hi> was so unluckily call'd aside by a <hi>Good Office</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi>; we should have had the Toy <hi>stamp'd else with Priviledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Information tells me further; that the <hi>Bauble</hi> was <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd</hi> up, for fear of <hi>Venting,</hi> and so sent several ways; which being perform'd with much <hi>Secresie</hi> and <hi>Dispatch, does but bespeak a general Tumult, and prepossess the Nation against better Reason.</hi>

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> take notice, that though the <hi>Book</hi> addresses to
<pb facs="tcp:49955:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Bishops,</hi> from <hi>Them</hi> of all the <hi>rest,</hi> 'tis with most care <hi>conceal'd</hi>; but on the <hi>Other side</hi>: The <hi>Copies</hi> flye in <hi>Swarms</hi> about the <hi>Nation:</hi> that is, where they may do most Mischief; however kept from them, to whom they seemingly apply for <hi>Satisfaction. Is this fair Play my Masters?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See now the <hi>Timing</hi> of it: <hi>upon the just Nick, when the Bishops are consulting a Christian, General,</hi> and <hi>Friendly Accommodation:</hi> and <hi>That's</hi> the Event they <hi>Dread; DOMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NION</hi> or <hi>CONFUSION</hi>; — being their <hi>Motto.</hi> Did ever <hi>Presbyters</hi> set footing any where, and <hi>Blood</hi> or <hi>Slavery</hi> not go along with it? This Comfort yet attends the Broyls they cause; <hi>The WARR'S a less Plague then the</hi> GOVERN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT.</p>
            <p>Once <hi>more</hi>; who knows but they have chose this <hi>Juncture,</hi> for some yet more <hi>malicious</hi> ends?</p>
            <p>They have not stickled to make <hi>Parties</hi>; — held their <hi>Consults</hi> and <hi>Conventicles: — Printed</hi> and <hi>Preach'd Sedition</hi> all this while only for <hi>Exercise</hi> or <hi>Pleasure.</hi> Do they not now expect to reap the fruits of their Disloyal Labours?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Parliaments adjourn'd,</hi> and in this <hi>Interval,</hi> 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond doubt they think to do their Businesse: what can be else the drift of this their <hi>Challenging Petition</hi>; and at this most <hi>unseasonable Instant</hi>; but <hi>to precipitate a Breach, and disappoint the General hopes of their next Meeting?</hi> Nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the <hi>Faction,</hi> then to discourse <hi>what wonders the</hi> next <hi>Parliament will do: and hint the Approching end of</hi> This.</p>
            <p>Unthankful Creatures! have they so soon forgot, <hi>who sav'd them?</hi> Their <hi>Mushrome-Honesty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nemo repente.</hi>
               </note> has in a night forsooth shot it self up from <hi>Hell</hi> to <hi>Heaven.</hi> 'Tis a wide step, from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,</hi> to <hi>strict Holyness:</hi> —from <hi>Robbing</hi> the <hi>Material Church,</hi> to the <hi>advancing</hi> of the <hi>Mystical:</hi> — from a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, Merciless oppression of Gods Ministers</hi>; — to a <hi>true pity towards his Servants.</hi> In fine; 'tis a huge leap, from the <hi>Dross</hi> of <hi>Humanity,</hi> to the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi>; yet in the case before us, there's but a <hi>Thought,</hi> a <hi>Moment</hi>; but an <hi>Imaginary Line</hi> that seems to <hi>part</hi> them.</p>
            <p>'Twas the Kings <hi>Fiat</hi> that strook <hi>Light</hi> out of <hi>Darkness,</hi> and made them pass for what they should be; His <hi>Majesties
<pb facs="tcp:49955:8"/>
Command,</hi> that drew the <hi>Curtain</hi> betwixt the <hi>World,</hi> and their <hi>Transgressions</hi>; and betwixt <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are not yet at <hi>Ease</hi>; they have their <hi>Heads</hi> again to make new Stakes with: and we have another <hi>King</hi> to lose, if they can catch him as they did his <hi>Father.</hi> Just <hi>Thus</hi> began the <hi>Late Rebellion</hi>; and if good order be not taken with these <hi>Relaps'd Apostates,</hi> just <hi>Here</hi> begins <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it only the same <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Design</hi>; but it will soon appear, that the same <hi>persons</hi> are now <hi>in</hi> again, <hi>whining</hi> and <hi>Snivelling</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> (as they did ever) only to <hi>Cheat</hi> the <hi>Multitude,</hi> and to <hi>engage</hi> a <hi>Faction.</hi> They have now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd this Pamphlet all over <hi>England</hi>; as I am fairly assur'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why to the People first?</hi> Unless they intend to make <hi>use</hi> of them? and what <hi>use</hi> can they make, but <hi>Violence?</hi> This is to say, that if the <hi>Bishops will</hi> not do them <hi>Reason,</hi> the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> shall. <hi>Next; Why so many?</hi> but to beget a <hi>thorough-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection</hi> to the <hi>Establish'd Liturgy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short; What is all This, but to cry <hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Murther</hi> to the Nation; <hi>When they themselves are the Aggressours; and 'tis a Flame of their own kindling</hi>?</p>
            <p>Truly these are <hi>Symptomes</hi> (as the Country Fellow said) of an <hi>Apostacy</hi>; We'll come a little nearer now, and feel their <hi>Pulse.</hi>

               <p>What, Sir <hi>John B</hi>— too? <hi>Your most humble Servant Sir,</hi> Pray'e while I think on't let me ask you a Modest Question or two; (with favour of your Friends here.)</p>

                  <hi>Some</hi> say, he's a <hi>Physician</hi> (but I hear no Body say so that knows him) and that 'twas only a cast of his <hi>Profession,</hi> to advise <hi>Breathing of a Vein with a Dog-whip.</hi> (for betwixt <hi>Friends</hi> some of the new-modell'd <hi>Gimcracks</hi> take <hi>Mee</hi> for <hi>Mad.)</hi>

               <p>I am the rather inclin'd to believe <hi>This,</hi> because I'm told that <hi>He,</hi> and <hi>Barkstead,</hi> (late of the <hi>Tower)</hi> were formerly <hi>Fellow-Servants,</hi> and <hi>conferr'd Notes.</hi> Now this same <hi>Barkstead</hi> laid that very <hi>Law</hi> to me: He told me <hi>that I was a</hi> Fidler, <hi>and that a Fidler was a Rogue by the Statute.</hi>

               <p>Some will needs fasten it upon one, that would have made the <hi>PRESBYTERY</hi> of <hi>Pauls Covent-Garden, INDEPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DENT:</hi> and that he took an <hi>Edge</hi> they say, because of a <hi>Jerk</hi> I gave to a certain Friend of his; who upon <hi>Richard</hi>'s comming toward the <hi>Crown</hi>; PRAY'D <hi>devoutly that the Scepter might not depart from the Family.</hi>

            <head type="sub">NOTE. III.</head>
            <p>OUr <hi>Liturgy</hi> was very much to blame sure: <hi>Seventy Six Quarto-Pages</hi> to <hi>reform</hi> it? Pray'e <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> since y'are so Liberal of your Labours, do but once blesse the World with a <hi>Presbyterian Dictionary,</hi> that we may be the <hi>better</hi> for them. <hi>It would be an Excellent means I can assure ye, to beget a right understanding betwixt the King and his People</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Alas! how <hi>Ignorant</hi> were <hi>We,</hi> that all this while took <hi>Reformation</hi> only for <hi>Amendment</hi>; a <hi>Pruning</hi> perhaps of some <hi>Luxuriances,</hi> and setting things <hi>Right,</hi> that were out of <hi>Order.</hi> But now we <hi>stand Corrected,</hi> and perceive that to <hi>reform</hi> is to <hi>destroy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was not <hi>Church-Government</hi> REFORM'D? yes, by an Act of ABOLITION. Was not the <hi>Kings Power</hi> RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORM'D too? yes, by a <hi>Seisure</hi> of his <hi>Regalities</hi> and of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49955:12"/>
his Sacred <hi>Person.</hi> At this rate, is our <hi>Liturgy</hi> REFORM'D: that is, 'tis totally <hi>thrown out</hi>; and a wild <hi>Rhapsody</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherences,</hi> supplies the <hi>place</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Presbyterian <hi>Reformation</hi> signifies <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition.</hi>
               </note>Note here <hi>Good People of the Land,</hi> that <hi>Presbyterian</hi> REFORMATION <hi>signifies</hi> ABOLITION. By the same <hi>Irony</hi> they made <hi>YOV FREE,</hi> and <hi>HAPPY</hi>; the <hi>King</hi> A GLORIOUS PRINCE: <hi>advanc'd the</hi> GOSPEL. — When of all <hi>Slaves</hi> you know ye were the <hi>cheapest,</hi> and the most <hi>Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous:</hi> Your <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> hanging upon the Lips of <hi>Varlets</hi>; — Your <hi>Consciences tenter'd</hi> up to the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and every <hi>Pulpit</hi> was but a <hi>Religious Mous-trap.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, remember, that <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion, had the same Authority,</hi> and that those <hi>Prodigies</hi> of <hi>seeming Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyness,</hi> your <hi>Kirkify'd Reformers</hi>; those <hi>Reverend Cannibals,</hi> that made such <hi>Conscience</hi> of a CEREMONY, made none of BLOUD-SHED. This is not yet, to <hi>prejudge Tenderness</hi>; and to conclude <hi>all Forwardness of Zeal</hi> to be <hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> Let it rest <hi>here</hi>; we have from <hi>Truth it self, that Liberty may cloke Maliciousness</hi>; we have it likewise from <hi>experience</hi>; for we our selves have been <hi>Betray'd</hi> by most <hi>malicious Libertines.</hi> The Question is but now how to discern the <hi>Real,</hi> from the <hi>Counterfeit:</hi> and <hi>That,</hi> so far as may concern the <hi>Plat-form</hi> here before us, shall be my <hi>business.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>Reformers</hi> Leave, we'll <hi>shortly, plainly,</hi> and <hi>sincerely</hi> examine the matter.</p>
            <p>They pretend in the <hi>Front</hi> of this <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> to exhibite to the World,<note place="margin">Fraud.</note> 
               <hi>A</hi> REFORMATION <hi>of the Liturgy,</hi> but upon <hi>search,</hi> we find just nothing at all of it: only a <hi>Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> and <hi>Talking</hi> thing of their <hi>own</hi>; in stead of a most <hi>perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> and <hi>solemn service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That's <hi>Fraud</hi>; Score <hi>One,</hi> Good People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> they confess themselves <hi>authorized to treat</hi> [only] <hi>about the ALTERATION</hi> of it:<note place="margin">Usurpation.</note> to propose <hi>This</hi> for <hi>That</hi> perhaps, <hi>one</hi> Clause or Passage for <hi>another:</hi> but barely to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> or <hi>offer</hi> at the total ABROGATION <hi>of the old form,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49955:12"/>
is to assume a <hi>Power</hi> we do not find in their <hi>Commission.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is <hi>another Presbyterianism.</hi> Reckon <hi>Two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi>; they were to <hi>Treat</hi>; They did so; and <hi>the debate prov'd Fruitless:</hi> Where lyes the <hi>Fault</hi> I pray'e? Do but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a little.</p>
            <p>His Majesty, out of a Gracious Inclination to <hi>gratifie</hi> all persons whatsoever, of <hi>truly-Conscientious,</hi> and <hi>tender Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples:</hi> appoints a Consult of <hi>Episcopal,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian Divines</hi> to advise jointly upon some <hi>general expedient;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to satisfie all <hi>reasonable Parties,</hi> (saving <hi>the Glory of God; the Good of the Church; his own Royal Dignity; the Peace, and welfare of his People.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What they insisted on, ye see under their own hands;<note place="margin">Design, not Conscience.</note> and that the <hi>Change of Government,</hi> was That they aim'd at, not (as they would perswade the World) <hi>relief of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That day wherein this Proposition should be granted,</hi> would (I much fear) <hi>prove but the</hi> Eve <hi>to the Destruction of this Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am no <hi>Prophet,</hi> but my kind Friends, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> before they have done, I think will make me pass for one. They make good every Syllable I promis'd for them, in my <hi>Holy Cheat:</hi> and if the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ormond</hi> would forgive me, I should presume to mind his <hi>Grace,</hi> of a <hi>Paper,</hi> which (now more then a <hi>Twelve-month</hi> since) was left at <hi>Kensinton</hi> for his Lordship; although not known from WHOM, to this Instant.</p>
            <p>We are to Marque here a <hi>Third Property of this Faction.</hi> They propose things <hi>unreasonable, unnecessary,</hi> and <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: More then they ought to ask,</hi> as to <hi>themselves:</hi> — more then the <hi>People</hi> can be suppos'd to <hi>want</hi>; on whose <hi>behalf</hi> they seem to <hi>Beg — more then the King can Grant,</hi> with Safety to his <hi>Majesty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they'r <hi>repuls'd,</hi> how sad a Tale they tell,<note place="margin">The Method of Sedition.</note> of the <hi>hard usage of Gods People!</hi> This is done in a <hi>Sermon,</hi> or <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> — Let them alone <hi>thus far,</hi> and once within a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, you may expect a <hi>Remonstrance, a state of the Case</hi>;—

or some such business. <hi>That's dangerous</hi>; for 'tis ten to one, That <hi>Presbyterian Legend</hi> will have <hi>some Cutting Truths</hi> in't. <hi>(no Government being absolutely faultless)</hi> The <hi>Vulgar,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as easie to <hi>avoid Errors,</hi> as to <hi>discover</hi> them; and finding <hi>some Truths</hi> in the <hi>mixture,</hi> swallow down all the Rest, for <hi>Company,</hi> (and for <hi>Gospel.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next News, possibly may be the Storming of <hi>White-hall,</hi> or the <hi>Two Houses</hi> with a <hi>Petition against Bishops.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>You are not <hi>(first)</hi> the <hi>Judges</hi> of the Case: so that in <hi>That</hi> Regard, 'tis an <hi>Impertinence.</hi> Nor are you <hi>vers'd,</hi> (I speak to the <hi>Common</hi> sort) <hi>Instructed</hi> in the <hi>Controversie.

            </p>
            <p>Now ask your selves <hi>This Question.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether did you contract Those <hi>Scruples</hi> which they charge upon you; (if <hi>really</hi> you have <hi>any)</hi> upon the accompt of your <hi>own judgement</hi>; or from their <hi>Instigation</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If upon <hi>Their accompt,</hi> observe what <hi>use</hi> this sort of people have ever made of your <hi>Beleevings:</hi> how Step by Step, they have drawn you on, from a meer <hi>Counterfeit</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> to a direct <hi>Insensibility</hi> and <hi>Loss</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Thus far, we have met with very little, either <hi>fair dealing</hi> or <hi>Moderation</hi> from them. But perhaps they'll say, that <hi>less would have contented them.</hi> 'Tis very right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if <hi>manifested to be unmeet.

they have a mind to see? They'll say perchance too for the <hi>Printing</hi> of it; that it was only done to shew the World that they had discharg'd their <hi>Duties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Duty</hi> was discharg'd in the bare <hi>Tender</hi> to the <hi>Bishops</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We have seen the <hi>Earnestness</hi> of his <hi>Majesties Desires,</hi> a word now to the <hi>Drift</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of them: from whence, flows the cleer evidence why they <hi>oppos'd</hi> them.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Reconciling</hi> Terms at last are <hi>These. Episcopacy</hi> they lay aside: — they totally reject the <hi>Common-Prayer:</hi>

If so, we beseech you suffer us to use it, who seek nothing by it, but to Worship God as nere as we can, according to his Will who is Jealous in the matters of his Worship.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It seems <hi>they do not like the Form of the Church:</hi> — nor the <hi>Church Theirs</hi>; where lyes the <hi>Authority</hi> betwixt them? But <hi>theirs is more</hi> perhaps <hi>in Scripture-Phrase:</hi> — and <hi>lesse</hi> in <hi>Scripture-meaning.</hi> 'Tis not the Crying <hi>Lord, Lord:</hi> — nor the Crowding of so many Texts hand over head into a <hi>Prayer,</hi> that makes our Service acceptable: But the due, genuine, and fervent <hi>application,</hi> and <hi>conformity</hi> of our <hi>Words, Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> to Gods <hi>Revealed Will.</hi> I speak with <hi>Reverence</hi> to those <hi>blessed Oracles</hi>; which in themselves however accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate to our <hi>Relief</hi> and <hi>Comfort,</hi> may yet by our <hi>abuse,</hi> be render'd <hi>Mischievous:</hi> They are the Dictates of the God of <hi>Order,</hi> and hold no Fellowship with <hi>Confusion.</hi>

            <p>[B] <hi>Touching our Saviours Charge to St. Peter:</hi> it was a Charge to <hi>Him; to Feed his Sheep</hi>; no warrant to the <hi>Sheep</hi> to be their own <hi>Carvers.</hi> It was his <hi>Office</hi> too, <hi>to reclaim Straglers,</hi> and keep within his Fold, such as he found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to wander after <hi>strange Shepheards.</hi> He was the <hi>Judge</hi> too of the <hi>Food</hi> that best befitted them; and if at any time he saw them hanckering after new Walks and Pastures; It was his Part to <hi>overwatch</hi> their <hi>Appetites</hi>; they might perchance take <hi>poysonous Plants</hi> for <hi>wholsome</hi> else; and reject <hi>better nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment:</hi> Blaming the <hi>Meat</hi> for the <hi>Disorders</hi> of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</hi>

               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49955:21"/>
               <hi>Yes certainly, so far as they had need of them.</hi> We have not yet forgotten, how they besought <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> on the behalf of <hi>tender Consciences</hi>; — how they laid forth the sad Estate of many <hi>Thousands, ready to famish for want of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly food:</hi> which <hi>delicate, and weak-stomach'd Christians,</hi> were forsooth, those Religious Brutes <hi>that brav'd his Sacred Majesty in his own Pallace: that forc'd the Votes of the Two Houses: —demolish'd Churches:</hi>— yes, <hi>and had Thanks too for their good Affections, and the SMECTYMNUANS</hi> to plead their Cause.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>great Kindness,</hi> but not <hi>Lasting.</hi> For as the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Power encreas'd,</hi> and the <hi>Kings Lessen'd:</hi> (effected, partly <hi>by false play in his Majesties Quarters</hi>: and partly by a Potent <hi>Combination</hi> betwixt the <hi>Kirk,</hi> and <hi>Scotifi'd English)</hi> The <hi>Consistorian Party</hi> began now to bethink themselves, how fairly to get <hi>quit</hi> of their <hi>old friends</hi> the <hi>Independents:</hi> plainly discovering, that <hi>what was</hi> CONSCIENCE, <hi>while they needed their Assistance, was become downright</hi> SCHISME, <hi>when they could live without it</hi>; and so That <hi>Liberty,</hi> which was cry'd up at first for <hi>Christian,</hi> and <hi>necessary,</hi> was by <hi>Those very Ministers</hi> Preach'd <hi>down</hi> again, as most <hi>Intolerable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet to conclude; FAITHFUL they are; that is: to their <hi>first Principles,</hi> of <hi>Pride: Ambition,</hi> and of <hi>Infidelity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they are LABORIOUS <hi>Preachers</hi> likewise, we shall not much deny, for truly, I think,<note place="margin">Laborious.</note> no men take more <hi>pains</hi> in a <hi>Pulpit</hi> then they do: or would more willingly <hi>compass Sea and Land to gain a Proselyte.</hi>

               <hi>AND we beseech you consider, when you should promote the joy and thankfulness of his Majesties Subjects for his happy Restauration, whether it be equal and seasonable to bring upon so many of them, so great Calamities, as the change of able, faithful Ministers, for such as they cannot comfortably commit the conduct of their Souls to, and the depriving them of the Liberty of the publick Worship; Calamities far greater then the meer loss of all their worldly Substance can amount to: in a day of common Joy, to bring this causlesly on so many of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Subjects, and to force them to lye down in heart-breaking Sorrows, as being almost as far undone, as Man can do it; this is not a due requital of the Lord for so great deliverances: Especially considering, that if it were never so certain, that it is the Sin of the Ministers that dare not be Re-ordained, or conform; it's hard that so many thousand innocent people should suffer even in their Souls for the faults of others.</hi>

            <p>Now what's all this, to the Exteriour <hi>mode</hi> of <hi>Worshipping?</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s advice was <hi>Decency</hi>;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.40.</note> in General Terms, not Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>Thus,</hi> or <hi>so</hi>; but <hi>Decently</hi>; and leaving to the <hi>Church</hi> the <hi>Judgement</hi> of that <hi>Decency.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Some</hi> Posture or <hi>other</hi> we <hi>must</hi> worship in; as <hi>Kneeling, Sitting,</hi>

            <p>'Tis the same thing, the Case of all Those <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> which are only of <hi>meet,</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> relation to the Duty.

And how comes it to pass that unity, concord and order must be placed in those things, which are no way necessary thereto. Will there not be order and concord in Holy obedience and acceptable Worshipping of God, on the Terms which we now propose and crave, without the foresaid matter of offence?</hi>

            <p>[E] <hi>It is easie to make any man an Offender, by making Laws which his Conscience will not allow him to observe, and it's as easie to make that same man cease to seem disobedient, obstinate, or factious, without any change at all in him by taking down such needless Laws.</hi>

            <p>HOw these good people beat the Bush, and yet start no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing! <hi>The Liberty of the Primitive Times,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>what Primitive</hi> Times? where will these men begin their Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? The late Primate of Ireland, tells us, that [<hi>all the Churches in the Christian world, in the first, and Best times, had their set forms of Liturgy whereof most are extant in the writings of the Fathers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke. 1 1.2.</note> 
               <hi>at this day] —when you Pray, say — Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.] In the <hi>Apostles</hi> age, the <hi>Holy Ghost abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly supply'd all humane needs, by super-natural Graces, and Inspirations.</hi> But the Use of <hi>Liturgies</hi> is too cleer, to suffer or admit a contradiction.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A modest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.</note>Yet this they are not very earnest in; <hi>allow them onely the Liberty of the following Ages</hi>] and what was that I beseech ye? <hi>Onely the Power of making and Altering Liturgies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; as under the same Prince ha's been formerly permitted to Particular Pastors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Away away for shame, with These <hi>Horse-coursing</hi> Tricks; they <hi>dresse</hi> a <hi>sound Leg</hi> to amuse the People, when the <hi>Jade</hi> wants an <hi>Eye.</hi> Look ye be not Cheated with Their <hi>Ambition,</hi> and never trouble your selves for their <hi>Consciences:</hi> They'll shift in all weathers; — for in case of necessity.—</p>

            </p>
            <p>I would the whole Nation might but once dream of such a <hi>Whipping,</hi> as when these <hi>Reverences</hi> got the Law into their own hands, their bounty would bestow upon them. They would use no other <hi>bug-word</hi> to their <hi>Children,</hi> then the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians are coming.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wer't not a <hi>blessed Reformation,</hi> to have an <hi>Almighty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition,</hi> set up in every <hi>Parish</hi>: to see a <hi>Pontificall Presbyter</hi> rule as <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Priest</hi> over the <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Consciences</hi> of his <hi>subjected congregation?</hi> To have but <hi>One Commandement</hi> to keep, in stead of Ten; <hi>Obey the Presbyter.</hi> — In truth 'tis such a <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Clouts,</hi> I cannot chuse but play the Fool
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49955:30"/>
with it: Briefly; when <hi>They're</hi> permitted to make <hi>Laws</hi> let <hi>us</hi> make <hi>Halters:</hi> We have tasted them already, and if They proceed to mind <hi>us</hi> of their <hi>Old Discipline,</hi> let us mind <hi>one another</hi> of our <hi>Old slavery</hi>; and <hi>Them</hi> too, that they now plead for a <hi>Bratt, by their own rule not to be received into the Church</hi>; for it was <hi>conceived</hi> in <hi>Schisme</hi> and <hi>Brought forth</hi> in <hi>Rebellion</hi>; (God blesse us) I mean <hi>Presbytery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas they urge that <hi>several Liturgies have been allowed under the same Prince,</hi> &amp;c.—] Confeis'd: It <hi>hath</hi> been so, and may be so <hi>again,</hi> and with good reason too; yet all this while, This proves no <hi>Title</hi> our <hi>Pretenders</hi> have to the <hi>same Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where People of <hi>differing Humours,</hi> and wonted to <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Customes,</hi> are united under the <hi>same Prince; Prudence</hi> advises a <hi>Diversity</hi> of <hi>Liturgyes.</hi> Again; 'Tis one thing to <hi>perswade</hi> a Prince; another thing to <hi>force</hi> him (but the main reason is yet to come.) These <hi>bold Petitioners</hi> presse the King to <hi>give</hi> them what they <hi>Got,</hi> and <hi>kept,</hi> (so long as they could <hi>hold</hi> it) by <hi>Rebellion:</hi> — to <hi>grant away,</hi> what his <hi>Royal Father</hi> held dearer then his <hi>Bloud</hi>; and to complete the shamelesse proposition, some of the now-<hi>Petitioners</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> were the hot <hi>Persecutors</hi> of the <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, they act, as if they would vie <hi>Provocation</hi> with the Kings <hi>Mercy:</hi> they ask, That which his Majesty cannot <hi>grant,</hi> but with a <hi>Double hazzard</hi> to himself; — both from the <hi>Government,</hi> and from the <hi>Persons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[A] <hi>IF you should reject (which God forbid) the moderate Proposals which now and formerly we have made we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly crave leave to offer it to your consideration,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>[B] <hi>If after our submission to his Majesties Declaration, and after our own Proposals of the Primitive Episcopacy, and of such a Liturgy as here we tender, we may not be permited to

            </p>
            <p>[C] <hi>And we doubt not but you know how new and strange a thing it is that you require in the Point of Reordination. When a Canon amongst those called the Apostles deposeth those that Re-ordain, and that are re-ordained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[D] <hi>Not only the former Bishops of</hi> England, <hi>that were more moderate were against it, but even the most fervent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of the Presbyterian way; such as Bishop</hi> Bancroft <hi>himself; how strange must it needs seem to the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to the whole Christian World, and to future Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that so many able, faithful Ministers, should be laid by as broken Vessells, because they dare not be re-ordained? and that so many have been put upon so new and so Generally dis-rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished a thing.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how have they submitted?</hi> They have not <hi>Strook,</hi> That's all.

Yes, and abuse the <hi>Freedome</hi> of proposing <hi>some Alterations,</hi> by the <hi>Rejection</hi> of the <hi>Whole.</hi> Suitable to This <hi>Submission,</hi> are Their <hi>Proposals,</hi> both of the <hi>Primitive Episcopacy,</hi> and of their <hi>Liturgy.</hi> Their <hi>Liturgy,</hi> as we have spoken formerly, is a Contest for <hi>Dominion,</hi> not for <hi>Conscience,</hi> and comes to This at Last; <hi>If they may not Rule, they will not worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Primitive Episcopacy,</hi> sounds as much as <hi>Presbytery:</hi> for they <hi>confound the Termes,</hi> as if <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> were <hi>Originally</hi> the same; and <hi>Prelacy</hi> (as the Queynt <hi>Smectymnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> has it) of <hi>Diabolical Occasion,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>To give the matter <hi>Credit</hi>; they Appeal to the Reverend <hi>Hall,</hi> and <hi>Vsher,</hi> those <hi>Learned, Moderate Bishops</hi> (as they Term them) whose Pens are to bear witness against <hi>These</hi> now in <hi>Being,</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> if they refuse their Askings. I am told, (and I believe it) that at least <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Smectym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuans</hi> had a hand in this <hi>New Liturgy, and Petition for Peace.</hi> If so, I must needs put the Gentleman a Froward Question.</p>

               <hi>Is Bishop Hall so much emprov'd since he Dy'd?</hi> (in truth a <hi>Prelate</hi> to whose Memory the Church of <hi>England</hi> owes great Reverence) This was that <hi>Learn'd and Moderate Bishop,</hi> that <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> so bespatter'd under the Name of the <hi>Remonstrant.</hi> But will you see now how that <hi>Noble Prelate</hi> was bayted by <hi>five</hi> of our <hi>new-fangled Primitive Bishops?

               <p>This is enough to clear the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Institution</hi>; But <hi>That,</hi> they'll say is not the Question?

               <p>That is; they will allow a Bishop <hi>to Rule in Consociation with his Presbyters:</hi> and This looks gayly to the <hi>Common-People.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>In</hi> 1610. <hi>a Question was moved by Doctor</hi> Andrews, <hi>Bishop of</hi> Ely,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>touching the Consecration of three</hi> Scotish <hi>Bishops; who,</hi> as he said, <hi>must first be ordained Presbyters, as having received no Ordination from a Bishop. Bancroft</hi> being by, <hi>maintain'd it not necessary, seeing where Bishops could not be had, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation given by the Presbyters must be esteemed lawful.</hi>] This carri'd it.</p>
               <p>Hence, it appears, that <hi>if Bishops could have been had, their Ordination by Presbyters had not been lawful.</hi> Had not these Gentlemen now as good have let the old Bishop alone, as have taken the <hi>Dorr</hi>? as <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> has it.</p>

               <p>None are <hi>Turn'd out</hi> (so far as I can hear) upon That Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; But sure, 'tis a fair reason not to <hi>Admit</hi> them: For it denotes them <hi>Factious,</hi> and in Truth, the common business of their <hi>Lectures</hi> is <hi>notorious Schism.</hi>

            <p>BElieve me, and we are now upon a weighty Question. <hi>Who shall be Judge, the</hi> People, <hi>or the</hi> Church;<note place="margin">The <hi>Church</hi> the Judge.</note> 
               <hi>Which is</hi> Christ's Flock? That is, <hi>Whether shall</hi> One <hi>be the Judge of all the</hi> Rest; <hi>or all the</hi> Rest <hi>be the Judge of that</hi> One? (for that's the point) What signifies the <hi>Multitude,</hi> but a number of <hi>single Persons,</hi> where each <hi>Individual</hi> acts, and accompts for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</hi> whereas the <hi>Church,</hi> is both by <hi>Divine Deputation,</hi> and by <hi>Political Paction, Authoris'd</hi> and <hi>Acknowledg'd</hi> to be the <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there were nothing in't but <hi>common Expedience;— Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Interest,</hi> and of <hi>State:</hi> me-thinks, <hi>That</hi> might suffice, to make us rest in <hi>Their Decrees,</hi> to whom, as by a <hi>general reference,</hi> we have subjected the <hi>Decision</hi> of all our <hi>Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> But the Benignity of Providence treats us more kindly <hi>yet</hi>; annexing all the <hi>Blessings</hi> of <hi>both Worlds</hi> to our <hi>Obedience:</hi> which surely no man will <hi>oppose,</hi> that is not wholly void of <hi>Religion, Moral Honesty,</hi> and of <hi>common Prudence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>it is better to obey God then Man,</hi> they'l tell us, <hi>Has the Church any jurisdiction over our souls? any right of Imposing upon our Consciences?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No, God forbid.

            <p>It is confess'd, that <hi>Softness,</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> becomes the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and 'tis <hi>enjoyn'd</hi> them; But then <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diance</hi> likewise befits the <hi>Children:</hi> whose part it is meekly to <hi>obey,</hi> in all matters not <hi>directly sinful,</hi> but to <hi>Resist</hi> in <hi>None.</hi>

               <hi>Preaching Ministry,</hi> and <hi>Lectur'd</hi> up the people into a <hi>Gospel-frame,</hi> (for that's the <hi>Knack</hi>) of <hi>Disobedience.</hi> The People heard their Prayers; (for 'twas to them they prayed) <hi>Meroz</hi> was <hi>curs'd,</hi> and <hi>curs'd</hi> — and the right Reverend <hi>Matrons</hi> sent forth their <hi>Bodkins</hi> and their <hi>Thimbles to help the Lord against the Mighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine; <hi>The Cause prosper'd under their</hi> Ministery, <hi>and</hi> Things unnecessary <hi>were taken away</hi>; that is, <hi>King, Bishops, the Law of the Land, the Liberty of the Subject: — the Heads and Fortunes of his Majesty's best Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some <hi>Oathes</hi> that were of exceeding <hi>scandal</hi> and <hi>burthen</hi> to <hi>weak consciences</hi> were <hi>taken away too,</hi> or rather <hi>exchang'd,</hi> for others less <hi>offensive,</hi> to the sense of the <hi>Learned, Pious,</hi> and <hi>Peaceable men,</hi> they speak of. As for instance; in stead of that Abominable <hi>Oath of Canonical Obedience to the Bishop and his Successors,</hi> (in omnibus Licitis, &amp; honestis) <hi>in all things lawful and honest</hi>; A <hi>Covenant</hi> was introduced of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination</hi> against them. But no man was compell'd to take it neither; for 'twas but <hi>losing the capacities of Englishmen; a Sequestration;— Rotting in a Gaol,</hi> or some such <hi>trivial pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,</hi> if they <hi>refus'd</hi> it. Indeed, to <hi>serve the King</hi> after the <hi>taking</hi> of it, was a little <hi>dangerous,</hi> because of an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Aug.</hi> 16.1644. declaring, that <hi>whosoever shall voluntarily take up Arms against the Parliament, having taken the</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Covenant, <hi>shall die without mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, the <hi>Covenant</hi> was somewhat more in <hi>Scripture-phrase,</hi> and suited better to the <hi>gust</hi> of the <hi>godly.</hi> So for the <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Oathes</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi>; They gave us <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>; still mov'd by <hi>tenderness of Conscience</hi>: They made a <hi>scruple</hi> forsooth, of <hi>swearing</hi> with <hi>Vs</hi> to <hi>serve the King</hi>; but they made <hi>none</hi> of <hi>forcing Oathes</hi> against him. To make an end; The late <hi>Presbyterian Rebellion</hi> has cost the <hi>three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> at least <hi>fourscore millions</hi> of <hi>Treasure,</hi> besides <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi>; and now they are hammering of the Nation into <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They talk of <hi>Conscience:</hi> so <hi>Peters,</hi> their <hi>fellow-labourer,</hi> was a man of <hi>conscience</hi>; was he not? the foulest part of whose lewd life, was That wherein they wrought in <hi>common fellowship.</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49955:38"/>
In short; the <hi>Presbyterians bound</hi> and <hi>prostituted</hi> the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and the <hi>Independents</hi> were the <hi>Ravishers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These drops are sharper, than in any other case would stand with <hi>Modesty:</hi> but they are <hi>Truths,</hi> so <hi>timely,</hi> and so <hi>needful</hi> for the <hi>Publick,</hi> that they shall out, what ere they cost me.</p>
            <p>What do these Creatures keep a coil with <hi>Sin</hi> for? that <hi>Act</hi> as if there were no <hi>God</hi>; and yet they <hi>talk,</hi> as if they thought of nothing <hi>else.</hi> Are not their <hi>Contradictions</hi> upon <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord?</hi> has not the <hi>Nation,</hi> in all Quarters, the witnesses of their very <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Pens</hi> against them? Was ever any <hi>Tyranny</hi> so <hi>barbarous,</hi> as what these people exercis'd over the <hi>consciences</hi> of their <hi>fellow-subjects,</hi> and against the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which they had <hi>sworn</hi> to <hi>preserve?</hi> Yet <hi>now,</hi> when the <hi>Authority</hi> requires <hi>Obedience</hi>; the <hi>learned pious men</hi> are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a sudden with strange fits of <hi>conscience: — FROM SUDDEN DEATH</hi> (in the <hi>Letany</hi>) must be, forsooth, <hi>FROM DYING SVDDENLY</hi>; (a most important Scruple!)</p>
            <p>Well, but <hi>forbearance</hi> (they say) <hi>cures, and eases them.</hi> We do not know, had the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of the <hi>Angels</hi> been once <hi>pardon'd,</hi> what such a <hi>mercy</hi> might have wrought upon the <hi>Devils.</hi> But <hi>here</hi> we are upon <hi>Experiment. After so large an Act of Grace; — so flowing and magnificent a Bounty; — so prone a goodness toward their whole Party</hi>; now to <hi>Re-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt:— Misereatur Deus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are much careful not to take an <hi>able Minister</hi> for a <hi>Schismatick:</hi> they take not half that care to distinguish a <hi>Schismatick</hi> from an <hi>able Minister. If Christ</hi> (they say) <hi>should find that</hi> able Minister <hi>cast out for a</hi> Schismatick? <hi>what then, good people?</hi> But what (say I) if Christ should find <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> kept in for <hi>able Ministers?</hi> what then, good Brethren?</p>

            <p>The <hi>Reformers</hi> cannot believe the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>Binding:</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Reformers</hi> cannot <hi>believe</hi> that they ought to be <hi>kept out</hi> for <hi>Inconformity</hi>; the <hi>Church</hi> cannot <hi>believe</hi> that they are to be taken <hi>in,</hi> unless they <hi>conform.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Reformers</hi> cannot but believe the <hi>Separatists</hi> to be <hi>Saints</hi>; the <hi>Church</hi> on the other side, cannot but belive them to be <hi>Schismaticks.</hi>

            <p>THis is but loosely argu'd: to Reason from <hi>an universal Fallibility,</hi> to an <hi>universal Toleration.</hi> Because <hi>all men</hi> may <hi>commit errors,</hi> therefore all <hi>errors</hi> must be suffered. The <hi>Law</hi> respects <hi>common equity,</hi> and <hi>politick convenience</hi>; not the <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Folly</hi> in the <hi>Transgressors</hi> of it. If <hi>Fools</hi> were <hi>priviledg'd,</hi> all <hi>Knaves</hi> would plead <hi>Ignorance.</hi> There may be subsequent allowances in favour of misguided <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,</hi> but they are of <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Relaxation,</hi> not of strict <hi>Justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All <hi>stated Laws (better</hi> or <hi>worse,</hi> no matter) if they are not <hi>simply wicked,</hi> are <hi>obliging:</hi> and to correct a <hi>publick Sanction,</hi> by a <hi>private Hand,</hi> is but to mend a <hi>Misadvice</hi> by a <hi>Rebellion.</hi>

            <p>This they <hi>concede,</hi> that <hi>All may erre:</hi> Then they <hi>themselves</hi> are not <hi>Infallible:</hi> so that the <hi>Competition</hi> rests betwixt the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Reformers.</hi> But <hi>now,</hi> to what we are <hi>sure</hi> of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are some cases wherein a Subject</hi> must not obey <hi>his Prince; but I defie the world to shew me</hi> any, wherein <hi>he may</hi> Resist <hi>him.</hi> That were to say, <hi>A Subject is no Subject.</hi> To say, he may be <hi>Su'd,</hi> makes nothing; That <hi>Law</hi> which war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants the <hi>Compleynant</hi> is virtually the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again; That which betwixt <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> were a fair Rule, holds no proportion betwixt a <hi>Personal Weakness,</hi> and a <hi>Publick Inconvenience. The giving way to Clamours of this impetuous and froward nature, cost the late King his life.</hi> To say more, were to prejudge my Betters; let this suffice.</p>

And nature having planted in all men an unwillingness to suffer, and denyed to all men a Love of Calamity, and necessitated men to feel when they are hurt, and made the Tongue and Countenance the Index of our sense, these Effects will be unvoydable, while such Impositions are continued, and while a fear of Sinning will not suffer men to swallow and digest them, and what wrongs such divisions about Religion will be to the Kingdom; and to his Majesty, we shall not mention, because our Governours themselves may better understand it.</hi>

            <p>If the <hi>Apostles</hi> had been <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> they would perhaps have begun with their <hi>holy Discipline,</hi> and laid the <hi>Sacraments</hi> aside to be considered of at <hi>leisure.</hi> Had it not been a most preposterous course, to have directed the <hi>manner</hi> of our <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> before they had laid the <hi>foundation</hi> of our <hi>Faith?</hi>

            <p>[E] <hi>We have now faithfully, &amp;c.</hi>] With what <hi>Faith, Reason,</hi> or <hi>Necessity</hi>— soever <hi>the case was spread before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops:</hi> we're sure 'twas fouly done to spread the case before the <hi>People.</hi> But where's the Faith, of taking an <hi>Ell</hi> for an <hi>Inch:</hi> — of <hi>abolishing</hi> what they pretend to <hi>alter:</hi> — of <hi>perverting Scripture:</hi> — and of putting an <hi>Arbitrary Nothing</hi> upon the People, instead of a <hi>Set-form?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where lies the <hi>Reason</hi> of presenting the <hi>Opinions</hi> of the <hi>Simple,</hi> as <hi>Arguments</hi> to the <hi>Wise:</hi> — of opposing <hi>Number</hi> to <hi>Equity: — Tumults</hi> to <hi>Authority:</hi> — and of <hi>pressing</hi> his <hi>Majesty,</hi> to put himself into the power of those very people that <hi>dethron'd</hi> his Father?</p>
            <p>Lastly, where lies the <hi>necessity</hi> of insisting upon so many <hi>variations,</hi> as are already prov'd to be utterly <hi>unnecessary?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now see the <hi>Remedies</hi> they offer us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which come to this; They propose to cure <hi>good Order</hi> by <hi>Confusion. Honest</hi> and <hi>safe</hi> they say they are; and <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>safe</hi> we may believe them; but we must first believe, that <hi>there's</hi> no <hi>Knavery</hi> in <hi>Nature:</hi> for set mens <hi>consciences</hi> at <hi>liberty</hi> once, to <hi>think</hi> what they please, their <hi>hands</hi> will not be long restrained from executing those <hi>thinkings.</hi> Never was a <hi>general Freedom</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but for a <hi>particular design:</hi> nor was it ever <hi>granted,</hi> but the next proposition was <hi>Equality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they propose it here, it seems, <hi>as to prevent the fear'd enemies of our distractions.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Behold a <hi>drop fallen from the lips of Prudence it self.</hi> Are we in <hi>danger already</hi> and shall we be in <hi>less,</hi> when those we fear are in <hi>more power</hi>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> the Design is Dangerous, <hi>as</hi> Presbyterian. <hi>For I do not find where ever yet that Government was Setled, but by</hi> Conspiracy, <hi>and to the</hi> Ruine <hi>of the</hi> Supreme Magistrate. <hi>(With Reverence to the</hi> Reformed Churches; <hi>whose</hi> opinions <hi>in matters of</hi> Faith <hi>may be</hi> Sound, <hi>and yet the Extraction of their</hi> Discipline, vitious.)</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The</hi> Proposers <hi>of This</hi> Peace (<hi>as they call it) were the</hi> Promoters <hi>of the Late</hi> War: <hi>and by those very means did they destroy the</hi> Last King, <hi>which they here offer as Beneficial to</hi> This.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The very</hi> Matter <hi>of their</hi> Proposals, <hi>imports a</hi> Denyal <hi>and</hi> Usurpation <hi>of the</hi> Kings Authority. <hi>His</hi> Majesty <hi>may</hi> not <hi>prescribe a</hi> Set-form <hi>of</hi> Worship: <hi>They</hi> Themselves <hi>may for</hi> [WEDDED, JOYN'D] <hi>&amp;c.—stamp'd with the</hi> Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49955:49"/>
                  <hi>signifie nothing: But change them into</hi> MARRIED, CONJOYN'D, <hi>&amp;c.] and the</hi> Reformers Seal <hi>to them, They pass for</hi> Current.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Their Propositions are an utter disclaim of the</hi> Episcopal Order: <hi>for they</hi> oppose <hi>under pretense of</hi> Conscience, <hi>all</hi> Powers <hi>or</hi> Faculties <hi>derivative from</hi> Bishops: <hi>as</hi> Canonical Obedience, Ordination, Subscription, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>They Press the King to act against his Declar'd</hi> Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: <hi>and to condemn the</hi> Blessed Memory <hi>of his Father; who</hi> Dy'd <hi>because he could not</hi> Grant, <hi>what they</hi> demand <hi>now from his</hi> Royal Successour.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The</hi> Ground <hi>of their</hi> Pretense, <hi>is</hi> Scandal <hi>and</hi> Unfitness <hi>for the</hi> Ministry <hi>in the</hi> One Party; <hi>Great Holyness,</hi> Ability, <hi>and</hi> Conscience <hi>in the</hi> Other, <hi>which to</hi> allow, <hi>were to make</hi> Martyrdome, <hi>and</hi> Loyalty Scandalous; <hi>and to give</hi> Treason, Faction, <hi>and</hi> Hypocrisie, <hi>the</hi> Credit <hi>and</hi> Reward <hi>of</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynesse. (<hi>for That's the Difference betwixt those that</hi> Ruin'd <hi>the</hi> Late King, <hi>and Those that</hi> Perish'd <hi>for him, which Two are now the Question.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>The very</hi> Style, <hi>and</hi> Manner <hi>of the</hi> Addresse, <hi>is</hi> Mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, Libellous, <hi>and</hi> Mutinous: Menacing, <hi>in the</hi> Title; [A Petition for <hi>PEACE.] That is</hi>; no Peace <hi>without a</hi> Grant. Libellous, <hi>in the</hi> way, <hi>and</hi> purpose <hi>of it. A</hi> Nameless, Close, <hi>and</hi> Defamatory Invective <hi>against</hi> Bishops. Mutinous <hi>in the</hi> Scope, <hi>and</hi> Consequence; <hi>'tis an Appeal from the</hi> Supreme Power <hi>to the</hi> People.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The</hi> Liberty <hi>they</hi> ask, <hi>Extends to any thing they shall call</hi> Conscience: <hi>and Then what</hi> Crimes, <hi>and</hi> Villanies <hi>shall not passe for</hi> Virtues, <hi>when every</hi> Malefactour <hi>is his own</hi> Judge?</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>To give these People what they</hi> ask <hi>is to allow the</hi> Reason <hi>of their</hi> asking: <hi>and at once to</hi> reward one Injury, <hi>and</hi> justifie another.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>They plead the</hi> Peoples Cause <hi>without</hi> Commission; <hi>and what the</hi> Church <hi>styles</hi> Schisme, They <hi>terme</hi> Religion; <hi>That,</hi> Christian Liberty, <hi>which the</hi> Law <hi>calls</hi> Treason.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>'Tis dangerous trusting of common</hi> Vow-breakers, <hi>and most unequal to</hi> challenge absolute Liberty, <hi>and</hi> allow none.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:49955:50"/>12. <hi>The grant of</hi> one unreasonable Request, <hi>begets</hi> another, <hi>till at the last, it becomes</hi> unsafe <hi>to</hi> deny, <hi>by having parted with too</hi> much.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>The late War began with a pretence of</hi> Reformation: <hi>and with</hi> Reformation <hi>are we now beginning again. It may very well be, that the</hi> same persons <hi>may intend the</hi> same things, <hi>by the</hi> same terms, <hi>and that they still propose to act by the</hi> same conscience: <hi>which if they</hi> do, <hi>in common</hi> equity <hi>and</hi> prudence, <hi>they are not to be</hi> admitted. <hi>If</hi> otherwise, <hi>till their</hi> Confession <hi>is as</hi> publick <hi>as their</hi> Fault, <hi>they are not to be</hi> believed. <hi>(I speak of</hi> Church-men <hi>more especially.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>If really the</hi> common people <hi>be disaffected to the</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>of the</hi> Church; <hi>surely these</hi> Ministers <hi>that preach'd them into these</hi> distempers, <hi>deserve rather to be</hi> punish'd, <hi>than</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifi'd <hi>for so doing. And that's the case. They themselves first stir up a</hi> factious <hi>humor in the</hi> Multitude, <hi>and then they call that</hi> Conscience, <hi>which is nothing else but a</hi> misguided Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>of their own procuring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>While they pretend to</hi> reform bad Laws, <hi>they</hi> destroy good <hi>ones; noy, they oppose the very</hi> scope <hi>and</hi> benefit <hi>of</hi> Law <hi>it</hi> self, common utility <hi>and</hi> concord: <hi>making their</hi> fickle <hi>and</hi> unquiet fancies, <hi>the</hi> Rule <hi>of that</hi> Authority, <hi>which better Reason meant expresly for a</hi> curb <hi>of our</hi> licentious wandrings.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Our Reformers place</hi> the last Appeal <hi>in the</hi> People; <hi>an excellent contrivance, to make</hi> That Party Judge <hi>of</hi> every <hi>thing, which effectually</hi> understands nothing.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>Whereas they plead</hi> Religion <hi>in the case, such a</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <hi>'tis, as the whole</hi> Christian world <hi>cann't shew</hi> the <hi>fellow on't: rather to</hi> justifie <hi>those</hi> outrages, <hi>which even</hi> Humanity <hi>it self</hi> abhors; <hi>than to admit those universal</hi> Rights <hi>of</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>which</hi> all men <hi>in</hi> society acknowledge, <hi>and</hi> submit <hi>to, but</hi> themselves.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>A furious</hi> Bustle <hi>they make with the silly people, for fear of</hi> Popery. <hi>Let this be observ'd,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath gain'd more English Proselytes (ten <hi>for</hi> one) during our Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Tyranny, than in proportion of time it ever did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Bishops. <hi>And</hi> still <hi>we</hi> lose; <hi>(I would I could not say) with</hi> Reason <hi>too: for what's</hi> Presbytery, <hi>but a more</hi> shameful
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49955:50"/>
                  <hi>and</hi> Intolerable Popery? <hi>(But all perswasions have their more</hi> moderate, <hi>and their</hi> violent <hi>Parties.) We talk of</hi> Jesuits; What is a Jesuite, <hi>but a</hi> Presbyterian Papist? <hi>or</hi> what a Presbyterian <hi>but a</hi> Reform'd Jesuite?</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>Their</hi> Propositions <hi>are an</hi> affront <hi>to the</hi> King, <hi>and a</hi> snare <hi>to the</hi> People. <hi>They</hi> ask <hi>leave to</hi> alter <hi>the</hi> Common-prayer, <hi>and they</hi> take <hi>leave to</hi> destroy <hi>it. They offer a</hi> new form, <hi>and they desire it may be left to the</hi> Minister's discretion <hi>which to use; which being granted, the Minister is left still at</hi> liberty <hi>to use</hi> neither. <hi>Thus do they play</hi> Fast <hi>and</hi> Loose <hi>with his</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; <hi>ensnaring likewise the</hi> People <hi>with a lamentable pretence, that they cannot</hi> obtain, <hi>what in effect no mortal can</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
               <p n="20">20. <hi>Let them now</hi> get <hi>what they</hi> ask, <hi>and they shall soon</hi> take <hi>what they</hi> please: <hi>for they onely desire, that they may</hi> do <hi>what they</hi> list, <hi>and then</hi> judge <hi>of their own</hi> doings. <hi>We all know what they</hi> have <hi>done, and call'd it</hi> Conscience <hi>too; so that their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent talk of</hi> Conscience, <hi>gives us no</hi> certainty <hi>of what they</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>to do. Wherefore 'tis</hi> safer <hi>to</hi> refuse <hi>than</hi> trust <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me be taken still to speak with reverence to <hi>Authority:</hi> and truly I shall further yet subject my <hi>Reason</hi> to my <hi>Charity</hi>; if any man will but do me the kindness to shew me onely one <hi>publick President,</hi> where ever a <hi>Presbyterian Faction,</hi> in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test <hi>for</hi> Power, and under <hi>no necessity, kept faith with any party.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What were all <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Ties of Honor,</hi> more then <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rushes,</hi> when they could <hi>gain</hi> by <hi>breaking</hi> them?</p>
               <p>How much I loathe these brawling Arguments, I might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the whole practise of my life, wherein I never yet put <hi>Pen</hi> to <hi>Paper,</hi> to any man's dishonor, that was not a profess'd <hi>enemy</hi> to the <hi>King:</hi> nor have I ever <hi>printed</hi> the least <hi>syllable,</hi> but on a <hi>publick score.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis now high time to end this tedious <hi>wrangle,</hi> which I must not absolutely quit, till I have given some Reasons for engaging in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I am ty'd by <hi>Oath</hi> to the <hi>discovery</hi> of all <hi>Conspiracies</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:49955:51"/>
against his <hi>Majesty, and by the Oath I have taken,</hi> I judge this here in question to be a <hi>foul</hi> one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> as a <hi>Subject,</hi> I am bound to do the <hi>King</hi> all lawful <hi>service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I look upon this <hi>Office,</hi> as a small <hi>Offering</hi> to my <hi>Country</hi>; 'tis no great <hi>vanity,</hi> if I believe <hi>some</hi> weak enough for <hi>me</hi> to <hi>teach:</hi> and 'tis a <hi>truth,</hi> that I as much desire to <hi>learn</hi> from <hi>others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are charg'd with <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Scandal, (the Presbyterians Livery)</hi> and I would have the world to know, that Those of the <hi>Censorious</hi> Cut are not all <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Philosophers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might add for a <hi>Fifth</hi> Reason, that <hi>general good allowance</hi> which my <hi>well-meaning weaknesses</hi> have found with the <hi>King's Friends:</hi> from whose <hi>agreement</hi> of opinion, I receive great <hi>assurance</hi> and <hi>encouragement,</hi> in my poor <hi>undertakings</hi>; and in their <hi>Charity</hi> much <hi>Honor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>All</hi> are not so <hi>satisfi'd:</hi> for at This Instant I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of several mean designes upon my <hi>Person, Freedom,</hi> and <hi>Credit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> amounts to <hi>nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Next</hi> I look upon but as the boiling of some old ranco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Humor</hi> against the <hi>King:</hi> — a <hi>Dream</hi> perchance of <hi>forty-four</hi> again. For sure no other Persons will <hi>condemn</hi> me <hi>Now,</hi> but those that would have <hi>hang'd</hi> me <hi>Then.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Third,</hi> I'm least of all sollicitous; for <hi>perjur'd persons</hi> are no <hi>proof</hi> in <hi>Law,</hi> and for the <hi>rest,</hi> I fear them not.</p>
               <p>It will be urg'd perhaps, <hi>What has this scribling Fellow to do with the publick?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I cry ye mercy, Gentlemen.</hi> You count it nothing then, after <hi>three Prentiships</hi> spent in the <hi>Royal Cause,</hi> to be <hi>bespatter'd</hi> by those very persons that overthrew it?</p>
               <p>This is the course of your Implacable <hi>Distempers: The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers are abus'd, and the Presbyterians complain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Give me leave onely to offer ye two or three <hi>Questions,</hi> and I have done. (The <hi>first</hi> an <hi>old one,</hi> but not yet <hi>Resolv'd.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:49955:51"/>First, <hi>VVithout</hi> Repentance <hi>can there be any</hi> Salvation? <hi>or, without</hi> Confession <hi>and</hi> Restitution, <hi>any</hi> Repentance?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>VVhy will not you</hi> swear <hi>to</hi> obey Bishops, <hi>as well as ye</hi> Covenanted <hi>to</hi> destroy <hi>them? and why may not you as well be</hi> forc'd <hi>to take a</hi> lawful Oath, <hi>as you</hi> forc'd others <hi>to an</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful one?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>VVhy is it not as lawful for</hi> Bishops <hi>to</hi> silence Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, <hi>as for</hi> Presbyterians <hi>to</hi> extirpate Bishops?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One Fool</hi> may <hi>ask</hi> more <hi>Questions,</hi> than <hi>twenty VVise-men</hi> can <hi>answer.</hi>
