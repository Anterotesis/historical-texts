            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE VINDICATION OF Mr. <hi>Brunskel</hi>'s Diſcovery of ABUSES, And of his Propoſals to <hi>Remedy</hi> them.</head>
            <p>SHeweth <hi>Abuſe</hi> 1. That diverſe Proceedings, whereon Your Majeſties caſual Revenues ariſe, are never recorded, becauſe the head Officers, forſaking the old practice to record Proceedings, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing be done thereon) take their own and Judges Fees upon ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, &amp; leave the Attorneys to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58937:10"/>
record them, <hi>when,</hi> &amp; <hi>as</hi> they pleaſe: whereby they often deceive your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of your <hi>Capias pro fine,</hi> and put your Subjects to the trouble and charge to record divers Judgments upon Poſt-Rolls two or three Terms afterwards; But if the Paper Copies be loſt, as ſome have been, Your ſubjects loſe their Debts thereby.</p>
            <p>This may be prevented, if Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Surveyor, and his Deputies may have the ſigning of all Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, for ſecurity of Your Majeſties Profits, as the Officers have, for the ſecurity of their own &amp; Judges Fees; keeping in like manner a ſettled Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in or near the Seal-Offices of every Court, for conveniency of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneys to repair unto.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the Surveyor is bound in point of intereſt, without the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of an Oath, to be true to your Majeſties intereſt; whereas the head Officers intereſt oppoſe your Majeſties: Therefore, as Judges, and head Officers underſtanding Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys tricks, not truſting their own
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58937:10"/>
Fees to be paid according to what the Attorneys and Practizers (in the voluntary performance of their Oaths and Duties) Record, ever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them to reaſonable Methods, upon prudent Surmiſes, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Tryals and Convictions by Suits in Law or Equity, as fully appeareth by the Remembrances and Records of every Court. And the Judges fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſtop Suiters motions untill Affidavits be fyled, and Officers Fees paid: <hi>Ergo</hi> (being enjoyned by the Statute 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. to do all reaſonable things to procure your Majeſties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits) They may ſubject the Officers to this Method, or reduce them to the firſt practice, as your Majeſties Attorney General adviſed to be done for your Majeſties intereſt; becauſe it's impoſſible to know what Officers neglect, unleſs it be known what Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers ought to Record and Eſtreat.</p>

            <p>This may be prevented, if Officers account in and receive a Warrant from the <hi>Exchequer</hi> for their Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, as other Accomptants do: And if Officers diſcretionarily tax, or add to the Suitors Coſts, ſo much as the Fine upon the Judgment <hi>quod Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atur</hi> doth amount unto; and take a <hi>Memorandum</hi> from the Attorney, to take care to ſee the ſame paid
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58937:11"/>
when the Coſts are levied, as the Officers uſed to do for their own damage clear; becauſe Coſts, by the Statute 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Chap. 15. may be taxed more or leſs diſcretio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, as they pleaſe: and by this means your Subjects will be free from paying more than the duty. The preſent Lord Keeper, by a Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power from your Majeſty, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth relief even where the Laws are deficient: And the Statute 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3 (now in force) enjoyneth his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and all the Judges to do all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable things to procure your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits: And the Statute 13 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. cap. 50. provideth where the Law faileth of a remedy, it may be ſupplyed by your Majeſties writ: <hi>Ergo,</hi> your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty wants not equitable or legal means to ſecure your Fines, with eaſe and relief to your Subjects, as propoſed.</p>

large and fictitious: ſo that the great expence and trouble of feeing Councel, Attorneys moving the Courts, and the difficulty; when all is done, to find Bail to the Original Action, eſpecially if they live remote from <hi>London,</hi> forceth poor People to diſadvantagious agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And Ejectments are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inſtead of Formedons; yet the Declarations are not compounded in the Alienation Office, or ſuch Fines paid thereon, as were uſually paid upon Formedons: And by the Statute 9 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. cap. 11.

            <p>This may be prevented, if head Officers in every Court, to whom it belongs, keep an exact Bill of

               <p>The Rates or Methods which the preſent Commiſſioners obſerve, appear to be Arbitrary, and very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient; for they never abate of the full Duty in Rents and Annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or certifie the Values otherwiſe than they are; becauſe they want a Commiſſion or Authority to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate where the Values are known; yet they rate other Eſtates five times lower than they appear to be by the Parties own Confeſſion: and to Cloak it, certifie upon the back of every Writ, that the Annual Values are affirmed to be as they rate them; whereas Deceit being <hi>Malum in ſe</hi> is diſhonourable, ſeeing <hi>veritas non Angulos querit;</hi> but more eſpecially in this Caſe, becauſe Your ſubjects may infer from thence, that it's not your Majeſties pleaſure to abate of the full Duty in any Caſe; and Your ſubjects in <hi>Wales, Durham, Lancaſter,</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> complain of paying
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58937:38"/>
more to Farmers, than their fellow Subjects pay to your Majeſty; and Younger Children, and Poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all other parts of your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Complain, That even right is not done to them (as the Statute 20 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. directeth) becauſe their Rent, Charges, Anuities, and whole Eſtates, pay after the rate of 25 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> and great Eſtates pay but 5 <hi>l. per Cent.</hi> at moſt, and rating great Eſtates higher or lower upon different occaſions: As for inſtance, Setlements lower than Purchaſes, and Mortgages lower than Setlements, maketh your Subjects think the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Arbitrary, who are apt to blame their Attorneys, if their Fines be not low; becauſe all Your Subjects na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally love to be freed from Duties. Therefore Attorneys wrangle with your Majeſties Commiſſioners for an Abatement to pleaſe their Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; which being obtained, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attributed to the Commiſſioners kindneſs, than you Majeſties Bounty: So your Majeſty neither gets your
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58937:38"/>
Duty? nor grateful acknowledgments inlieu thereof: Yet the Commiſſioners to excuſe themſelves, alledge their Caſe to be like the Officers of the firſt-Fruits, who have eſtabliſhed values, and no power to Adminiſter Oaths to diſcover any other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make all Spiritual Perſons pay equally and proportionably thereto. But the Commiſſioners in the <hi>Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> Office have a Maſter in Chancery aſſigned, who ſits in the Office on purpoſe to Adminiſter Oaths, to diſcover the improved Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues of Eſtates, That your Majeſty may not be deceived therein: And it's impoſſible to take meaſures by the rates of former Commiſſioners; becauſe Eſtates between one time and another, are clogged with or disburthened of Incumbrances, and daily improve or impair. It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the old Books, That <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd</hi> and <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> who were the firſt Commiſſioners upon the erection of this Office, ever Adminiſtred an Oath to diſcover the real Values of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58937:39"/>
Eſtates untill they found by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that Attorneys, and Solicitors, or their ill principled Clyents got Knights of the Poſt to under-ſwear them; then they omitted the Oath to rate diſſeretionarily higher for their Maſters ſervice, as they might Lawfully do, becauſe their Maſter the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was abſolute Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, anſwerable for nothing but the Rent, while they rated Eſtates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their real Annual Values; but the preſent Commiſſioners Caſe is far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, becauſe the ſurpluſage of the profits (as well as the Rent) is to be accompted for, and anſwered to your Majeſty; for your Majeſties Grant to the Lords Commiſſioners of Your Treaſury, is only a truſt for continuing the Office, to free Your ſubjects from the chargeable Formes of the Courts: Upon theſe conſiderations, Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> gave theſe following Opinions.</p>
