            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

made mee at a stand to
whom I might commend the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of this small Tractate,
especially bearing this Title. To
any <hi>Matron</hi> I durst not, though
never so modest; lest her consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

<pb facs="tcp:4247:3"/>
she had beene guilty of reading
the like <hi>Lectures.</hi> To a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

having beene often terrified
with his <hi>Curtaine clamours,</hi> I
might rather add to his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than insinuate into his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
Therefore to you, O
single <hi>Batchelours,</hi> and singular
<hi>Virgins,</hi> I recommend both the
patronage and perusall of these
papers; and the rather, because
in you it can neither breed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust,
nor beget distaste; the
<hi>Maides</hi> not comming yet to
<hi>reade,</hi> nor the <hi>Young men</hi> to be
<hi>Auditors.</hi> But howsoever I
proclaime this worke free from
all offence, either to the single,
or the double. <hi>Marriage is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi>
and therefore I say
unto thee, Marrie: feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<hi>Audaces fortuna juvat:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:4247:3"/>
for it may be suspected, if there
were fewer Bachelours there
would be more honest wives;
therefore I say againe, Marry at
all adventure. If thou hast chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
thinke them thine owne,
though they be not: thou art
sure to have a wife of thine own,
though the issue be another
mans. Be valiant, feare not
words, they are but wind, and
you live at land, and not at sea:
with which admonishment, and
encouragement withall, I bid
you generously farewell.</p>

               <p>Rare things in women. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

Of those that inveigh
against their sexe. Many

as presidents for
others to imitate.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was the opinion
of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> that a
serpent is engende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the marrow in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4247:7"/>
backe bone of a man decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and cast into the fields
without buriall: upon which
it is observed, that as the fall
and death of man came by
the serpent, so the life of the
serpent comes by the death
of man. And since the first
back-sliding of <hi>Adam</hi> there
hath beene such an antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
betwixt the seed of the
woman and the serpent, that
if the naked sole of her foot
shall tread upon his head,
though never so lightly, yet
the weight thereof is more
ponderous and fatall unto
him, than if he were beaten
with mallets, or a rocke or
mountain should precipitate
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4247:7"/>
it selfe upon him; for with
her bare touch he instantly
expireth. But if hee shall
but bite the heele of a man
(for at that still is his aime)
the poison disperseth it selfe
through all the parts of his
body, from which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
speedy and inevitable
death.</p>
            <p>A second thing worthy
remarke is, to consider how
provident nature hath beene
to teach women bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and modesty in their
lives, by concealing their
immodest parts after their
deaths: for it is familiar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, that if a man be
drown'd, his gallis no sooner
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4247:8"/>
burst, but he riseth with his
face upward: but if a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
perish in the water, she
swims with her face down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
of which some give
this reason, <hi>Omne leve fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
sursum, &amp;c.</hi> As every
light thing naturally as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends
up into the aire, and
that which is weighty stoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
it selfe downe to the
earth; so a man being broad
and heavie in the shoulders,
and but thin and light in the
breasts, the more ponderous
parts sinke, and those lesse

            <p>But in this my progresse

<q>Foemineum servile genus,

which in my thoughts, in

And <hi>in Bacchid.</hi> Nothing is

these, with many other, he

adherents belonging to all;

way to speake something of
virgins; for all women
were first maids before they
came to bee married. One
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4247:18"/>
saith of women in generall,
that they are wonders in
nature, if they would not
wrong nature. And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they bee admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Angels, if they would
not be drawen with Angels
to become Devils. And of
virgins thus: If they bee
faire, they are to bee won
with praises: and if coy,
with prayers: if they bee
proud, with gifts: if cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
with promises. And
as it is naturall in them to
despise what is offered, so
it is death to them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
what they demand.
Some compare their hearts
to the Cotton tree, whose
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4247:19"/>
fruit in the bud is as hard as
a bullet of iron, but being
ripe, it bringeth forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but soft wooll. But
give me leave a little to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate,
and leave them for a
page or two, to speake
something of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of virginitie it selfe.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> hath these
words; <hi>Quanquàm lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem
virginitatis non sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepi,
expressionem tamen,
&amp;c.</hi> Though I have not
undertooke to give virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
the due praise, yet I will
afford it some expression<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and first shew you in what
countrey she was bred, and
by what parent begot. If
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:4247:19"/>
that be our countrey where
our dwelling is, then is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the mansion of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie.
It hath here a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
there a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.
For what is virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
chastitie, but an integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
voyd of all contagion?
And whom can we call the
father thereof, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
Sonne of God,
whose flesh saw no corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and whose Divinitie
was not sensible of putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
How great then is
the honour of virginitie,
when our blessed Saviour,
a virgin, came of a virgin?
A virgin the Mother, a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the Sonne, begot of his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4247:20"/>
Father before all worlds,
borne of his Mother in the
world; the first proceeding
from his eternall goodnes,
that the second might bee
conducible to our everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
glorie. So likewise
the holy Mother Church,
his Spouse, is immaculate in
her conception, and yet
fruitfull in her issue, a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
in her chastitie, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in her children: being
a virgin shee generateth us,
not by the aid of the flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but by the assistance of the
Spirit; not with the throwes
and paines of the womb,
but by the joyes of Angels:
she gives us suck, not with
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4247:20"/>
the milke of the breast, but
the doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.
A virgin is the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Sion, a virgin is
the new Jerusalem, into
which no flesh can enter
that is common or uncleane.</p>
            <p>Note but how farre the

            <p>For many causes (saith
<hi>Iohannes Episcopus</hi>) did the
Saviour of the world chuse
to be borne of a wife espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to an husband: first, to
take away all aspersions
that might bee alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
her by the Jewes,
who urging the strength of

next, to prevent

should listen unto any false
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:4247:21"/>
suspitious rumours, by
which our blessed Saviour
might bee injured or defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
that in going and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
from Aegypt, shee
might have the company
and comfort of her husband
<hi>Ioseph,</hi> not a protectour
onely, but a witnesse of her
continued virginitie; as also
to beguile the Devill, the
open adversarie of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
who by reason of her
marriage, might be in some
hesitation and doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she were a virgin, and
therefore grow diffident
whether our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
were the Sonne of God,
or no.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:4247:22"/>Pope <hi>Leo, Parturiente
Maria, natus est nobis Dei
filius, &amp;c. Mary</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
or bringing forth,
to us and for us was borne
the Sonne of God; borne
of an untoucht woman, that
his humane birth might as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us that he was perfect
man, and her immaculate
virginitie confirme to us,
that he was perfect God; of
whom <hi>Maxinus Episcopus</hi>
to this purpose testates.</p>
            <p>Though when hee was
borne, earthly swathings
contained him, yet that hee
was not of earth, heavenly
signes witnessed of him.
Whilst he lay in the cradle,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4247:22"/>
he shined in the clouds; hee
cryed as an infant amidst
the Jewes, he raigned as an
Emperour amongst the
Gentiles: whilst hee suckt
amongst the Bethlemites,
hee was a worshipped<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and
adored by the Chaldeans;
when hee was visited by

by Kings; when he was
obscure in the stable, hee
was visible amidst the

he appeared in glory amidst
the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Therefore (saith a learned

            <p>The Romans so honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
chastitie, that such of
the Vestall virgins, as were
knowne to violate their

were called incestuous
(which word comes of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi>
a virginall girdle, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

and being convicted
of the fact, their judgement
was to bee buried alive.
They were Votar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lib.</hi> 6. with great elegancie
delivereth it in these words:
<q>
                  <l>—Ne viva defodietur
Humo:</l>
                  <l>Sic incesta perit; quia quam

                  <l>No Vestall Priest, to break

                  <l>Lest shee (yet living) in her

                  <l>Because the Earth and <hi>Vesta</hi>
are one power.</l>
               </q>
Moreover, their persons
were had in such reverence,
that the people gave them
almost divine adorations,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4247:24"/>
and the Senatours and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
at meeting gave them
way.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Lawes that
<hi>Lycurgus</hi> made, one was,
that no virgin, of what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
or condition soever,
should have any dowrie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
her to her marriage:
and being demanded the
reason thereof, he made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
lest those that be rich
should bee desired for their
wealth, or those that want
be despised for their pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
so that by marriage, the
Maid and not her meanes,
beautie &amp; vertue would be
acquired solely. He also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
at what yeeres ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4247:25"/>
sex should marrie,
which was at a mature age<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that from able bodies might
be propagated the stronger
issue. Neither would hee
suffer them to bed together
the marriage night, unlesse
by stealth, but to keepe the
Bride-groome and the
Bride (if it were possible)
many nights asunder, by
conference and company:
and being askt the cause
thereof, hee made answer,
Because they should still
prevent satietie, keepe thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bodies strong and in health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which would preserve their

            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:4247:25"/>Unguents and tinctures
he banished the Citie, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
mulcts and fines on
all those who were found
to use them: and in his
dayes, such was the rare
modestie both of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
and matrons, as that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie
was so little pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised,
that the name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was not knowne amongst
them. For <hi>Plutarch in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.
Apotheg.</hi> reports, that
a stranger asking one <hi>Gera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>data,</hi>
a matron of the old
Spartane race, what punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their Lawes inflicted
upon adulterers? She made
answer, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> had made
none, for there was no such
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4247:26"/>
monster to bee found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them. But hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying:
but say any such
should be, how then? Why
then (saith she) he must bee
fined to give a Bull with so
long and large a neck, that
shall stretch over the mount
Taygetus, and drinke of
the river Eurota. Which
hearing, he said, that was a
thing impossible. As im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
a thing (said she)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it
is in Sparta to finde an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer
or adulteresse.</p>
            <p>Now whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
or comely for a Vestall,
or profest virgin, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in her single and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contracted
estate, to bee
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4247:26"/>
pleasant in lookes, free in
language, wanton in carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
to poetize, or the like,
(howsoever she be of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
and chaste condition)
may be any just taxation of
her continence, it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
disputable. <hi>Seneca</hi> in
his controversies, speaketh
of a Vestall virgin, who but
for writing this verse,
<q>Felices nuptae, moriar nisi
nubere dulce est.</q>
was summoned into open
Court, and pleaded against
in these or the like words:
<hi>Felices nuptae,</hi> .i. happy are
those which be married.
These be the words of one
that longs for marriage,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4247:27"/>
which the Vestalls ought

I hold it not impertinent to
the present tractate in hand,
to shew you an history or
two (and those not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon)
how some Virgins,
but of meane condition and
quality, have, by their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
meerely, and generous
behaviour, attained to great
preferment and honour:
for varietie of Historie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt
with discourse of
times, makes the Argument
lesse tedious to the Reader.
Thus therefore it happened,
<hi>Pulgotius</hi> the Historian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my Author, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
me of one <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drata
Bertha,</hi> the daughter
of a private Florentine, but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4247:31"/>
of extraordinarie beautie
and vertue.</p>
            <p>It so happened, that the
Emperour <hi>Otho,</hi> the fourth
of that name, upon some
urgent occasion comming
to the great Citie of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
he was entertained
with all the sumptuous and
triumphall shewes which
could be then provided, as
best suiting with a State Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall.
He being one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to take the aire, a
great confluence of people
gathered about him, of all
degrees, to behold his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whom till then they
had never seene, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
on him for his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4247:31"/>
into the Citie, the
lowd acclamation of <hi>Ave
Caesar.</hi> Amongst all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Virgins and Damosels
there assembled, he cast his
eye upon this <hi>Galdrata Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi>
and on the sudden was
much taken with her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
in so much that, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to mother his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(for he had taken a most
especiall notice of her) after
he had retired himselfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Dukes Palace, where
he was at that time bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
feasted, he began o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
at the table to speake
of this Damosels beautie,
giving her a character of
prioritie before all that he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4247:32"/>
had before time seene.</p>
            <p>Her father, whose name
was <hi>Bellincionus,</hi> there
attending at the table,
finding by the Emperours
description that there was
no other likelihood but that
it was his daughter of whom
he gave such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
approbation, because
he reflected upon her sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
feature and habit, sends
for her privately to Court,
and commands her by the
duty of a child, all delayes
set apart, to make there her
present and personall appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.
To which the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Damosell (ignorant,
and no way suspitious of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4247:32"/>
any such treason intended
against her chastity, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from a father) assented,
and came. The banquet
being ended, and the table
withdrawne, the father
(worse than the Roman
<hi>Cabbus</hi> or <hi>Phuillus,</hi> branded
with eternall infamy, who
though honoured with the
stile of <hi>Equites Romani,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for gaine or flattery
were guilty of their wives
prostitution) he (I say) whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spered
the Emperour in the
eare, and told him that he
would presently bring him
into the company and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
of her whose
beauty and feature he had so
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4247:33"/>
liberally extolled. The
Prince gladly imbracing
the motion, he retired him
into a private and remote
chamber, where she was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
her fathers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
the Emperour at the
first enterview acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
her to be the same:
when the most unworthy
Parent of so accomplisht a
child, thus said unto him: Lo
here the Virgin by you so
much praised ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
her self to your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
whom you may with all
freenesse kisse and embrace
at your pleasure. At which
words <hi>Otho,</hi> almost extasi'd,
came toward her to take her
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4247:33"/>
by the hand, and proceeded
further to have toucht her
lips: but she astonisht and
abasht at her fathers unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
levitie and besenesse,
denied the Emperour her
right hand, and with her
left modestly put him back,
uttering these words: With
pardon to your high and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Majesty (Royall Sir)
n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ither of these your faire
proffers it lies in me to grant
you, having made betwixt
my Saviour and my selfe
such an irrevocable vow
and contract, that I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lend that hand or these
lips to any, of what state or
condition soever, whom I
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4247:34"/>
shall not undoubtedly know
to be my Lord and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
(at which the father
frown'd) and she further
proceeded and said (falling
low upon her knees, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tears dropping from her
eyes) Hee onely insidiates
my life that se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kes to take
away the least part of mine
honour; and there she pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Which in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of the Emperour
was uttered with such a
bashfull shame, and well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming
modesty, that in
the Prince it tooke a very
sudden and solid impression;
who comparing the villanie
of the father with the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4247:34"/>
of the daughter, and
setting the base Pandarisme
of the one against the rare
prudence of the other, it
compelled him into a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and distracted counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
For with a stern and
supercelious brow bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, but a smooth
and unwrinkled front appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto her, he made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
aiming his speech unto
her: Delicate and sweet
Virgin, are you then already
disposed of? or by private
contract engaged to any
man? To which she with a
low and well-beseeming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
answered, that she
had not as yet devoted her
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4247:35"/>
selfe unto any. Will you
then (replied the Emperour)
faire Damosell, give mee
leave to provide you of an
husband? Who answered
unto him, that it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in her great rudenes &amp;
indiscretion withall, not to
agree to such a motion, and
therefore with all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

she surrendred her

that since he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the inward vertue. We have
an old Adage frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

us, which for the
most part proveth true, that
choice is soonest deceived in
three things; namely, in
Brokers wares, Courtiers
promises, and Womens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancies:
therefore it is
good for all men to looke
before they leap; for it is
generally found,

            <p>In choosing a wife, looke
not upon the feature of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4247:43"/>
body, but search into the
fancies of her mind; and
take her not for her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
person, but her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
perfection. For if
thou makest election of
beauty, it fadeth; if of riches,
they soone waste; if of
fame, it oft proves false; if
of vertue, that only conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues.
For as <hi>Theopompus</hi>
tells us, If the eye be the
chuser, the delight is short;
if the will, the end is want;
but if reason, the effect is
happy. And <hi>Bias,</hi> one of
the Grecian Sages, was
wont to say, that he that
marrieth himselfe to a faire
face, oftentimes tieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4247:44"/>
to a foule bargaine.</p>
            <p>But there are some that
scarce will admit of any
choice at all, and say, Who
that is free will willingly
run into fetters like a foole?
For whosoever maketh
himselfe a Captive with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
constraint, incurreth the
imputation either to bee
counted wilfull or witlesse:
and amongst such, one deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entire unto me, who was
in a great hesitation whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to marry or no, shewed
me a fancy of his written to
that purpose, which was as
followeth:
<q>
                  <l>What kind of wife were I
best wed? A maide?</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:4247:44"/>Shee's young perhaps, and

                  <l>A widow? Who stale lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings

                  <l>One old? Thou of a crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed

                  <l>One fruitfull? Numerous

                  <l>One barren? Youth and
strength in vain are lost.</l>
                  <l>One rich? Shee'll domineer,
and master prove.</l>
                  <l>One poore? Whom want

                  <l>One mute? Her tongue will

                  <l>A prater? That's a burden I

                  <l>One faire? Such aptest are

                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:4247:45"/>One foule? Shee's tedious

                  <l>No marriage then, Ile keep

            <p>So much for choice: I
come now to discourse of
marriage it selfe, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
thereof. For though
<hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynick Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
was of opinion, that
for a young man to marrie
it was ever too soone, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:4247:45"/>
for an old man alwaies too
late; and <hi>Euripides</hi> the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
Poet calls it an evill,
yet to be desired; and that
<hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>obaeus</hi> saith, a woman
bringeth but two joyfull
daies only in her whole life
time, which are, the day of
her marriage, and the day of
her death; and that <hi>Thales</hi>
seeing <hi>Solon</hi> lament the
death of his son, gave him
no other comfort than this,
that for the like reason only
he had refused to marrie;
and that <hi>Cleobulus</hi> meeting
his son in the way, having
finished the nuptiall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,
presented him with
a branch of Hen-bane;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:4247:46"/>
thereby intimating, that his
sweet meat must be served
in with sower sawce, and a
terrible tempest was to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
so temperate a calme:
yet we reade on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the
famous Law-giver branded
all such with infamy as refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to marrie. And the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spians</hi>
made an edict, that
whosoever past their yeeres
singly, and did not contract
matrimony before they
came to fifty, in all feasts
and assemblies such should
have the lowest and most
dishonourable places allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, as those who had
neglected their prime and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:4247:46"/>
most flourishing time of
their age, and done a thing
meerely repugnant to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Homer</hi> tells us that the
Grecian Ladies in his daies
held wedlocke in such ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
as they reckoned
their yeeres from their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
not their birth: and
we Christians hold, that our
spirituall marriage is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
in baptisme, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in godly life, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated
in a repentant
death. Now concerning
whether it be necessitous or
no, it may be thus dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</p>
            <p>Matrimony is therefore
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:4247:47"/>
to be esteemed and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as being first ordained
in Paradise, and since conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
upon earth, and in a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
gratitude returnes us
many pious and gracious
children, to be made Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
and Saints in heaven.
It purchaseth man the name
of father here below, as a
type of that great and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Father above: here
generating, as he there crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
God made nature,
man here maintaines her:
and to such things as else
would perish by time (by
his posterity) he giveth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity.
Marriage puts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
into man, to fight
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:4247:47"/>
boldly in the defence of his
King and his Countrey.
For who can be a coward,
fearing his wife and children
may be made captives? It
maketh men wise, as carefull
to provide for them: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
temperance, and out of
voluptuousnesse breedeth
modesty: for it limiteth
lust within law, and prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
a moderation to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
which in it selfe being
damnable, is by matrimony
made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ufferable.</p>
            <p>Now if some shall object
and say, Though marriage
with peace may be called
the worlds Paradise, yet if
it be with shrife, it may be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4247:48"/>
termed the lives Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and that all such as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in haste may repent at
leisure: and some to the like
purpose, may quote <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in Adelphis,</hi> in these
words:
<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Duxi uxorem, quam ibi non
miseriam vidi? &amp;c.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>What have I got by marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a wife,</l>
                     <l>But misery to attend me all
my life?</l>
                     <l>Children I have, and that's
another care:</l>
                     <l>The charge to keepe them
makes me poore and bare.</l>
                     <l>In toile and travell all my
time I spend,</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:4247:48"/>But of my tedious labour
there's no end.</l>
                     <l>Now I am old, and for my
age thus spent,</l>
                     <l>What's my reward, but
hate and discontent?</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Many no doubt have for
these and the like feares bin
affraid, and forborne to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
at all, thinking with
<hi>Plautus,</hi> that he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to intangle and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
himselfe into a world
of troubles, may provide
himselfe of a ship to guide,
or a wife to governe. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
will say, he that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
one who is faire and
false, weddeth himselfe unto
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4247:49"/>
a world of miseries; or if
to one as vertuous as beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull,
yet in possessing a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
he at the best enjoyeth
but a needfull evill. To such
it may be thus answered,
that in this they rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
fortune than wedlock;
for all things that happen
crosse and averse, are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of chance, not of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony.
Much better it is
therefore carefully to respect
those good things thereon
necessarily depending, than
timerously to regard the
disasters accidentally refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting.
Admit the worst that
can be objected, yet is not
marriage therefore to be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:4247:49"/>
neglected; for if in all other
courses and passages of our
life we be crost, shall we
therefore be altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd
from prosecuting
them, as things accurst?</p>
            <p>Examine all trades, facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
disciplines, or professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
(to instance some few
in behalfe of the rest) what
practise is it, though the
most necessitous and usefull,
which may not be cavill'd
at, or that we cannot find
some colour to accuse? The
Husbandman, though the
frost prove violent, the
snow unseasonable, the
showers intempestive or
immoderate, yet doth he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4247:50"/>
not therefore forsake his
fields, cease his culture,
and despaire of an happie
harvest.</p>
            <p>The Mariner having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured
many stormes at Sea,
in which his goods have
been hazzarded, and his life
endangered, doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
upon his landing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tackle
his ship, and having
brought her from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
break her up to the fire;
but rather proposeth to
himselfe those many bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
which may arise by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation:
as that no profit
can be made without perill,
and no delightfull gaine but
with some great difficultie:

can rest in age be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,

            <p>Warres take away the

are not to be forborne for
the feare of evills that may

that the better may bee

or children die, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were borne, and
their bodies created mortall,
and not immortall.</p>
            <p>It may be therefore thus
further argued, that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
supplies such deficiencie
in nature: for by a second
nuptiall the wife loseth the
name of widow, and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
not only the late lost
name of husband, but to her
children the forfeited name
of father: by which marriage
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:4247:52"/>
maketh amends in what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
seemed to doe amisse,
and is rather a restauration
than a deprivation to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phancie
and Widow-hood.</p>
            <p>If you shall summe up the
cares and troubles that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon wedlocke, set but
against them the profits and
the pleasures, and they shall
farre surmount them both
in nature and number. What
greater content to a man,
than after the laborious tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells
of the day to repose at
night in the bosome of a
sweet and loving bed-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?
What more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
hope than the exectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an happy issue? The
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4247:52"/>
throwes of the mother are
forgot in the birth of the
child, and the pleasures of
the latter farre surmount the
paines of the former: the
peevishnesse of the childs
infancie is quite forgot
when he begins to prattle.
What comfort their toward
youth breeds, and what
consolation their more staid
yeeres beget, I leave to their
consideration who have
beene the fruitfull parents
of a fortunate progenie.</p>
            <p>If then by lawfull marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
soules are here inspired
upon earth to become glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Saints in heaven, and
parents (in their issue and

               </gap>itie all such
are justly deprived, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
themselves to a life
single and solitary. But
there ought to be a great
care in the Parents in dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of their children, the
better to continue this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
perpetuitie. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Aurelius</hi> informeth us,
that there was a custome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> or a
Proverb at least, that the
fathers to marry a son need
to spend but one day, but in
the disposing of one daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they ought to consider
with themselves ten yeers:
which were it even in these
times carefully observed,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4247:55"/>
and diligently imitated,
might be the prevention of
many inconveniences, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
palpable mischiefes, of
which we have had many
wofull examples.</p>
            <p>Some through their base
avarice, not willing to allow
unto their daughters suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
dowers. Others (too
prodigall) have stretcht
themselves beyond their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and meanes, to be the
ruine of their children by
pride, and of themselves by
poverty. Others (ill advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
or too selfe-opinioned)
by their too much dotage
on the sons have cast too
great a neglect upon the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4247:55"/>
daughters; by which, as
they lose time, so they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
duty, and many times
chastity: for when they
come to maturity of yeers,
such as their fathers have no
care to bestow, have a will
to dispose of themselves;
the event of which is for
the most part disaster and
penurie. Others will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
them to marry where
themselves like, and not
where their children love;
the effects of which are
commonly discontent and
misery (for inequality ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in yeeres, fortunes, or
affections, is the road way
to spouse-breach and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divorce:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4247:56"/>
for where there is
dis-union of hearts, there
must needs be disorders in
the house.</p>
            <p>How often have forced
contracts beene made to
add land to land, not love to
love? and to unite houses
to houses, not hearts to
hearts? which hath beene
the occasion that men have
turned monsters, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

concerning the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ceremonies observed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the <hi>Romans,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
in their contracts and
nuptiall ceremonies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> called them
<hi>Sponsalia, à spondendo,</hi> of
the vow and promise made
each to other; which words
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4247:57"/>
were writ downe, recorded,
and sealed before witnesses,
and those were called <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natores.</hi>
Before the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome
consulted severally
either of them with a sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer,
to know what <hi>omen</hi>
should be in their future
marriage. Of which <hi>Iuve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>

.i. The Soothsayer comes
with those that signed to
the contract. <hi>Aul. Gellius</hi>
informes us that the young
man gave unto the Virgin a

ring, which she ware upon
her fourth finger on the left
hand, because to that finger
alone (as the best Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
tell us) proceeds a
veine that hath its originall
from the heart. The word
<hi>nuptiae</hi> is derived from <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo,</hi>

the woman was presented
unto her husband in a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
vaile, which was called
<hi>Flamineum</hi> (which colour is
held to be the embleme of
jealousie) and with that she
covered her face. And in
regard of the good successe
which <hi>Romulus</hi> and his
souldiers had in their rape
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4247:58"/>
of the Sabine Virgins, they
still continued a custome,
that the Bride-groome
should snatch away the

or the next of their alliance
and kinred: and after this

the haire of her head with
the point or top of a speare,
with which some Gladiator

informeth me) was, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

should after dis-joine them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch in Roman. Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</hi>

the crowne was separated
with such a lance or speare?
Was this (saith he) a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole
or embleme that the

made by war and rape? Or
is this admonition to the

other curiosity) be only fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured
with the sawe and the

vaine or superfluous should
enter in at those doores?
Or doth it imply (by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance)
that wedlocke
ought not to be dis-joined
but by sword and death?
Or is it because the speare is
consecrate to <hi>Iuno,</hi> who is
also called <hi>Pronuba,</hi> that
is, the Goddesse of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
all her statues being
pourtrayed leaning upon a

she is called <hi>Dea quiritis?</hi>

            <p>The next day after the
nuptialls was a feast held, to
which all their friends and
kinred were invited, and
such they called <hi>Repotia:</hi>
their Aruspices or Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

            <p>There were then severall
waies by which a Virgin
became a mans lawfull wife:
The first was called <hi>

is, by prescription, that is,
if she were contracted by
her Parents or Overseers,
and continued with her
husband the space of three
entire yeeres, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
absent from him three
whole nights in a twelve
moneth. The second was,
<hi>Confarreatione,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
that when being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
before a Flamine or
chiefe Priest, before ten
witnesses, the married cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
eat together of a barlie
cake, before used in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
which was called
a <hi>Far,</hi> and the solemnities
(as <hi>Cicero pro Muraena</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verres)
were called <hi>Farra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:4247:60"/>
from barley. The third
was, <hi>Coemptione,</hi> of buying
and selling: for the wife
bought her husband, under
a seeming pretence, with a
small piece of silver. <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi>
speakes of a fourth,

by the ancient Roman
lawes,
<q>Nubentes mulieres tres ad

when the women that were
to bee married brought
three small pieces of money
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4247:61"/>
to the Bridegroome, the
man was not called by his

of the most excellent and
vertuous Matron <hi>Caia Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilia,</hi>
wife to <hi>Tarquinius

Spouse being brought home
by her friends to the very

                  </gap>
Caius? Hic sum ego Caia:</hi>
which <hi>Erasmus</hi> thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth,
<hi>Ut tu Dominus, ita

and she that was thus mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
might justly challenge
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4247:61"/>
the title of <hi>Mater familias,</hi>
or, Mother of the houshold.
The Bride was lighted thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with five torches bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which did intimate the
great necessitie that married
wives have of these five
gods and goddesses, <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Iuno, Venus, Suadela,</hi>
and <hi>Diana,</hi> otherwise cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Lucina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were no contracts
held to prove successefull
amongst the Romans which
were not celebrated with
the two elements of Fire
and Water. It is in one of
<hi>Plutarchs</hi> Roman questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
What is the reason
(saith he) that in all nuptials
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:4247:62"/>
the Bride is commanded to
touch Fire and Water? Is
it because the Fire is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Element, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
representeth the man;
and the water a passive, and
consequently an Embleme
of the woman? Or is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Fire illustrates, and
the water purgeth: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the wife ought by all
her endevours and industry
to preserve her purity and
chastity? Or is it because
that as Fire without hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to feed loseth its fury,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd abateth its strength; and
water without some heat
groweth use-lesse and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
motion: so man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:4247:62"/>
separated and dis-joi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
are of no validity and
power, but by conjunction
or commixtion of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
faculties, they by offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
belonging unto marriage
are made compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?
Or doth the morall
extend so farre, that the one
ought not to forsake the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but to endure prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and adversity alike,
though they be driven to
that extremity that they
have no other good thing
left them save only Fire and
Water to comfort them?
According to that of <hi>Seneca</hi>
the Tragedian, <hi>Amor peren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Conjugis castae manet:</hi> .i.
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4247:63"/>
The love of a chaste wife

            <p>THe maner of solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Marriage amongst
the Russians or people of
Muscovie is different from
other nations: for the man,
though he never in his life
time beheld the woman,
yet is he not permitted to
have any or the least view
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:4247:66"/>
of her when he would soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
her for marriage, but it
is done by his mother or
next kinswoman: and when
the match is agreed upon, as
well by the Parents as the
parties, (for without the
consent of the Parents no
marriage is held amongst
them lawfull) the father
and chiefe friends meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
and conclude about
the dower. It is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that the Virgin
brings the dower, but the
young man maketh her no
jointure unlesse she have is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
by him, and then shee
hath full interest in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:4247:66"/>And if she were never
married before, the Parents
and friends enter into bond
that she shall prove a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.
The contract thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
they send tokens the
one to the other, but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
no lookes all this
while. The Eeve before the
nuptiall day, the Bride is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
either in a Callimago
or Coach, or if it be win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
on a sledd (by reason of
the snow and ice) to the
house of the Bride-groome,
with her wedding clothes,
and the bed on which they
are that night to lie, which
for the most part is very
rich and costly. That night
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4247:67"/>
she is accompanied with her
mother and her other
friends, but all this while of
him not seene. The next day
she is married in a vaile, or
rather an hood of knit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

They and their friends ride
all to Church, being well
mounted, though never so

they be people of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

house, and there
lodged that night, her vaile

she is injoin'd from her

one word, because the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
is neither to see her

till the next morrow after
their marriage; neither is
she that day to speake at all,
saving some few limited
words, meerely of forme,
nor three dayes after. If
she transgresse the least of

            <p>The third day expired,
they depart unto their own

And herein is to be observed,
that for the marriage day,
and the whole time that the
nuptiall feast is solemnized,
he hath the honour to be
called <hi>Molodax Knez,</hi> that

<hi>Molodax Knezay,</hi> the young

            <p>
               <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> in the 6. book
of his Commentaries tells
us, that amongst the ancient
<hi>Gaules</hi> (which is now the
French nation) the husband
brought so much goods, and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:4247:70"/>
laid it down, as did amoun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to the dower which his
wife brought with her,
and a just account being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the stocke was put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the party surviving
being made full Executour,
and possessing both their
meanes to them and their
children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> gives a
noble commendation of the
<hi>Germans.</hi> The wife, saith
he, never bringeth or assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
any dower to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
but he to his wife, the
Parents, cousins, and friends
being present to approve or

she enterchangeably present

unto her.</p>
            <p>There are very few
knowne adulteries commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
amongst that great and
populous Nation, for the
punishment thereof is very
severe and speedy. For she

then stript naked, and after
brings her out of his owne
doores in the presence of all
his and her neerest kinred,
then beats her with a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toone

for there is no connivence
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4247:71"/>

granted to any woman who
hath once violated her wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke
chastity: neither can
her youth, beauty, or riches,
though all should meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in one, ever purchase
her to have the honour of a

and detestable is that sinne
held amongst them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Assyrians</hi> take their
daughters with them (when
they be marriageable) to the
market, and there such as
want wives buy them for
their money, or money-worth.
The like is in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
with the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and people of Thrace: so
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4247:72"/>
did the ancient Grecians
purchase their wives, either
for coine, or some other
commodity that was ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.

that if a poore mans daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

the constitution of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
I come now to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the minde.</p>
            <p>As there are many sorts
of wives, so there are many
kinds of husbands: as one
for instance (I begin with
the country.) A plaine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

occasion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from plow before his
houre, found a young <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
his neighbours sonne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
busie with his wife, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:4247:81"/>
came suddenly upon them
before they could any way
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vade it; which hee seeing,
said to his wife, O sweet
heart, what is this I see?
could'st thou not have pickt
out a more private place
then this? Ile put it to thy
selfe, how scurvily would
this have showne, if any
stranger but my selfe had
come in, and seene what I
doe how? and with this

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>But all husbands (as I said
before) are not of the like
temper; for instance: An

neighbours, used every
night as soone as her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
came to bed, to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize
him, what companie
he had kept? and how hee
had spent the day? and
still used to keepe him wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
past midnight, when
the poore honest man, who
had travelled hard all the
day, had rather been at rest;
and that shee would have
read him asleepe. But at
length observing that shee
was somewhat precisely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and that shee used often
to goe to confession, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to consider what great
sins she might be guilty of,
of which she need so often
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:4247:82"/>
to desire absolution: and to
that purpose watching the
time when shee used to goe
unto her Confessour, he had
gotten into the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and privately hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
so neere to the Altar
that hee might easily heare
whatsoever passed betwixt
them: and when amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quotidian (or as some
call them venial sins:) she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

            </argument>
            <p>A Question being asked,
why our first and
great Grandmother <hi>Evah,</hi>
was rather in her formacio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
taken out of the side of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
than any other part of
his bodie? It was thus lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
answered: Because the
side is the middle of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
to signifie that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is of equall dignitie
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:4247:91"/>
with the man; and therefore
shee was taken not from the
head, nor the foot; for she
must not be superiour or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
unto him. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
also that shee was
taken out of the left side:
for the heart of man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth
that way, rather
than to the other; to denote
unto us, that man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
should imbrace each
other with an hearty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
love: and as the left side
is the weakest, so the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
made from thence, is
the weaker ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ell. Also all
male children are conceived
in the right side, and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
in the left: and as the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:4247:92"/>
sides are defended by the
armes, so ought a woman to
be by her husband.</p>
            <p>Another demanding a
question, why women
were more apt to talke, and
for the most part, make a
greater &amp; lowder noise than
men? Answer was returned,
that for that there was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great reason to be given:
for saith he, wee know that
<hi>Adam</hi> the first man was
created from the dust of the
earth, which is of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
soft, pliant &amp; tractable,
and in the handling yeeldeth
no noise or sound at all: but
the woman was made of a
ribbe (a bone taken out of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4247:92"/>
               <hi>Adams</hi> side) which is of a
much harder temper. Now
for example, take a bushell
bagge or a quarter sacke, and
fill it with dust, or with
flesh, and tumble it or tosse
it which way you please, no
eccho ariseth from thence at
all; but empty them, and
fill them with bones, and
so shake and bowlt them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and you sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll then
heare what a ratling they
will keepe.</p>
            <p>Of a more gentle disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than those before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
was she of whom
I now am to speake, who in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead
of a Curtaine Lecture,
read by her to her husband,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4247:93"/>
had a strange one read to
her; the manner whereof
followeth. Not farre from
Reevilling, a Towne under
the Imperiall jurisdiction, a
very faire country wench,
but very simple withall,
who was newly married to
one of the young rusticks
there by, some quarter of a
yeere after shee had beene
married, came to a Friar to
be confest, who casting an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous
eye upon her, and
finding her by her simple an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to bee none of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest:
the businesse which she
came for, being quickly run
over, he presently fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another matter, and told
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4247:93"/>
her that she was run into
a great arrerage with him,
for not paying him Tithes.
The woman innocently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of him what Tithes
were due to him? Marry
saith hee, for every nine
nights which thou liest with
thy husband, the tenth is
due to me. Truely Sir, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
she, I pray you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
mine ignorance, and
heaven forefend but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
should bee due unto
you from mee, should bee
fully satisfied. At which hee
retired her into a sequestred
place, and there abused her
honest simplicitie. After
which returning backe to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:4247:94"/>
her house, shee began mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly
to chide her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
who would not tell
her of those duties and
tithes due to the Friar her
Confessour, and so told him
all the whole circumstances
before related. The man
said little, knowing the
weaknesse of his Wife, and
loath to have his owne
shame to be made publike,
yet vowing revenge in
heart; and fearing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Churchman, upon his
complaint the Friar might
find some favour with the
great ones, he bethought
himself of a safer course, and
resolved withall to bee his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:4247:94"/>
owne justicer: for, dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
the matter, and taking
no notice at all of any
such thing as passed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Friar and his
Wife, he made meanes to
infinuate into his more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
acquaintance; to
which the Friar most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
assented, because un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that colour hee might
have the freer and lesse su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitious
consocietie with his
Wife. Upon this new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
the rusticke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
him to dinner, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired
him to come alone;
which was a motion that he
willingly imbraced. The
day was appointed, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:4247:95"/>
good cheare provided: now
the good man commanded
his Wife to reserve all the
water shee made for two
dayes together, and keepe
it in a vessell by it selfe;
which was accordingly
done: hee invites two or
three of his neighbours,
whom hee durst best trust.
The Friar keepeth his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
the dinner is ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in, and he set betwixt a
couple of them so close that
there was no rising from
the table without leave: the
first trenchers were not
changed, but the good man
takes a deepe bowle, and
drinketh it off to the Friars
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:4247:95"/>
welcome (of wine good and
wholsome:) the Friar vowes
to pledge him supernacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,
and still casting a lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
eye upon the woman,
which the Host very well
observed; he whispereth to
have the Friars bowle brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with his Wives urine:
which he taking and tasting,
spit it out and said, Now fie,
what tart and unpleasant
wine is this? if I should
drinke it, it would poyson
me. The good man replied,
Doth not then this wine tast
you well? He replied, No
by no meanes: No, saith the
Host? Ile assure you <hi>it was
drawne out of the same vessell
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:4247:96"/>
from which you received your
Tithes;</hi> and either drinke it
off at one carowse, or bee
assured that it is the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st you
shall ever swallow. By
which the Friar finding his
former villany discovered,
tooke it off at a draught,
concluding with a sowre
sawce his former sweet bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
and being dismissed
thence without any other
violence, vowed to himselfe,
never to come under that
mans roofe after.</p>
            <p>I have read of a fellow
who travelled a great part
of the world over with a
paire of boots, which hee
had vowed to part with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:4247:96"/>
to no man, but such a one as
had an absolute power and
Empire over his wife: he
had past through many
Countries, and offered them
to all that he met, but no
man was either willing, or
else durst not accept them
upon these conditions: at
length meeting with a stout
fellow, a Black-smith, he
asked him if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them upon the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
aforesaid? who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
that he would, and
weare them in despight of
all the women in Europe:
(now the Smith had put on
a cleane shirt that morning)
Upon this answer the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:4247:97"/>
replied, Then Friend,
here take them to thee, put
them into thy bosome, and
beare them home. The
Smith replied, Not so, I
know a tricke worth two of
that: if I should put them
into my bosome, and durty
my cleane shirt, my wife
would not be well pleased
with that, for we should
have no quietnesse in the
house for all this day.
Which the other hearing,
snatched them away from
him, and said, Get thee
hence in an evill houre, who
goest about to cheat me,
being, as all others, afraid
of thy wives scolding; and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4247:97"/>
so left him: nor have I heard
whether he hath yet delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them unto any even to
this day.</p>
            <p>A Countrey fellow ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
married a substantiall
Farmers daughter, found
her within a twelve-moneth
to prove not only an arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scold,
still thundering in his
eares, but very lascivious
and unchaste, of which he
had manifest and infallible
proofes; and therefore hee
tooke occasion to complain
to his father-in-law both of
the morosity and inchastity
of his daughter. To whom
the good man gave this
comfort; Son, I advise you
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:4247:98"/>
to have patience, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
for a time: she is her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
daughter right, for just
such an one was she in her
youth, for I could neither
governe her tongue, nor—
but now she is growne old,
there is not a more quiet
and chaste Matron amongst
all her neighbours: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
arme your selfe with
patience as I did, and I make
no question but when the
daughter shall arrive unto
her mothers age, your wife
will prove as tractable and
quiet as mine is now; and
with this cold comfort dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
him:</p>
            <p>Another Rusticke being
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:4247:98"/>
married to a very handsome
peece, grew jealours of a
young fellow a Farmers
son, his neighbour (and
he had divers times upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
her with him:) at length
being angry, she bid him
not to feare any such matter
betwixt them, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
she had rather prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
her selfe to ten Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
than to one such clown
as himselfe, or him whom
he had so often cast in her
teeth.</p>
            <p>Another Countrey wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
following her husband
to his grave, not onely wept
and wrung her hands, but
tore her haire from her
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:4247:99"/>
head, uttering such lowd
cries and ejulations, that she
was much pitied, in regard
they feared that the very
sorrow for his death would
distract her of her senses.
Divers came about her to
comfort her, and they had
much adoe to keepe her
from leaping into his grave.
The like she did comming
backe. At length one that
was a widower, and well
knowne unto her, stept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her to lead her home
by the arme, and spake di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
comfortable words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her. To whom she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
No, she was undone
for ever, for she was left a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:4247:99"/>
lone woman, and a widow,
and had none to manage her
affaires, or to guide her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.
Who replied, Let not
that be your care, I am, you
know, a widower, and if it
please you to accept of me,
my suit is, that I may be
your second husband. To
whom she still weeping and
howling made answer, I
thanke you neighbour for
your good will and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offer, but indeed you
speake too late, for I have
already past my faith and
promise to another.</p>

put them in mind of a young
Friar who had often before

frequented the house.</p>
            <p>A Rusticke having the
day before beaten his wife
for reading a Lecture unto
him somewhat too lowd,
sent her the next day with a
Sow to the market to sell.
Her way lying through a
parke or thicke wood, and
she driving the Swine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her with a cord tied to
the hinder leg, a young
Clowne of her former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and who had
long beene a suitor to her to
corrupt her chastity (but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prevailing) overtooke
her just as she was entring
into the thicket; and having
first given her the good

other things, the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of time and place
but she still obstinately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him, and in such rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
words, that seeing her
resolution, he forbare to
speake of it any further, and
began to talke of other
things. But when she per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
they were almost
out of the forrest, and that
they were ready to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the open fields, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
how churlishly
her husband had dealt with
her the day before, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
thus to break with him,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:4247:101"/>
and say, You spake unto me
even now of a businesse I

me to a thing which I may
be sorry for I know not
when; but if I should now

            <p>A Tailor in the Citie,
who kept his wife very gal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lant
(who was indeed a very
choice girle, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
those cloathes which
she wore) before he had
beene married a full twelve-moneth,
perceiving divers
young Citizens, and other
Gallants, often to pass by his

impertinent businesse to his

the worst, call'd up his

chamber, and began to
question her about sundry
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4247:103"/>
things, of which the woman
was meerely innocent: all
this would not perswade
the man, but being absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
jealous of her honesty,
he began to schoole her in
very rough and course lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
which wakened a fire
in her bosome which till
then lay hid, and now brake
forth at her tongue. Then
she told him what matches
she might have had when
she was a maid, and what
fortunes she had neglected
in making choice of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
how she might have beene
married to a man, and now
she had cast her selfe away
upon a Tailor; with the like:
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:4247:103"/>
in so much that when shee
had once begun she knew
not how to make an end, but
call'd him foole, and jealous
coxcomb, putting him to
such a silence, that he had
not one word to utter; but
waiting till the storme was
over, he then began to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her, and give her the best
language that he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise,
with which they were
reconciled betweene them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and made friends.</p>
            <p>He then began to breake
with her further, that for
their continuance of love,
and to avoid all suspicion or
controversie that might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
arise betwixt them, she
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:4247:104"/>
would sweare unto certaine

answered, she would with

that afterall, he would
sweare her also to one thing
which her selfe would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.
Who gladly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that he would. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Sweet wife, will you never

            <p>Another Tradesmans wife

her husband being at a Faire

altogether averse to his suit,
threatning him, if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
to prosecute it any

made him at that time to

such interchange of vvanton

ansvvered him vvith No;
till at length hee urging
still further, from No shee

leaving his Mistresse making

and made an uproare in the

before he was napping, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
her of pardon, and said
he would willingly rise and

to creepe into thy Masters

thy Mistresse. Well, for this
time I pardon thee, but
charge you, without first
getting my good will, to do
so no more hereafter; and
without more words put
out the candle, and went to

            <p>The like to this was rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me of another, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned
his mistresse to
lewdnesse in the absence of
his master; to which act
shee would no way appeare
to give any consent at all:
but he thinking to prove
her to the full, told her that
he had vowed to steale into
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4247:107"/>
her chamber that night, nay
more, into her bed. Wilt thou
saith she? doe it then upon
thine owne perill, and I
will leave the doore open
a purpose; but withall I
tell thee before hand, I will
lay a knife ready drawn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
my beds head, with
which (if thou offerest to

came, and she stript her selfe,
put out the candle, and went
to bed: anone after in comes
hee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and softly stealing
(whilst she counterfeited a

bed side, he began to open
the sheetes, but finding her
not to move at all, doubted
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:4247:108"/>
to enter, left being suddenly
started, shee with the knife
might doe him a mischiefe;
and therefore thought to

out of sleepe, asked, Who

Hee answered againe, It is
I. What I, saith shee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine?
So hee told her his
name. And whats your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse
here at this time of
the night? Marry saith he,
I had thought to have come
to bed to you, but that I
durst not for your knife,
and therefore I am going
hence: which hearing, she

replied, Now beast that I
was to forget the knife,

Now shee had perswaded
her husband to creepe into a

they would not let

so much as a small sticke to

which (being almost stifled)
he was forced to sweare; nor
did hee offer the lest blow
after, in regard of his oath.
But not long after, a great
Wedding being kept in that
street, and he and his wife
invited amongst the rest, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dinner they fel to dance:
amongst the rest hee tooke
his wife to taske, and being
in a measure where the men
are to take the women in
their armes, and lift them
up from the ground, hee
took up his wife, and turning
round with her till hee came
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:4247:110"/>
to the top of the staires, and
then letting her fall head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
she tumbled downe to
the bottome, and great odds
she had not broke her neck;
and this hee did laughing.
But such was her good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
that shee was onely
bruised, as hee had before
been beaten; and finding it
no advantage for her further
to contend with him, shee
submitted her selfe, and hee
accepted of her submission;
which on both sides was
so unfainedly done, that
they lived in great unity and
love all the rest of their
life after.</p>
            <p>But not altogether to tire

Citizens vvives came to
a devoute man, vvho vvas
their ghostly Father, to be
shriven: and he demanding
of them what grievous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ins
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:4247:113"/>
they had committed, saith
the first, The greatest sinne
that I suppose my selfe to be
guilty of, was that upon a
time, I tooke a strange knife
which was not mine owne,
and put it into my sheath.
The good man not much
considering upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but thinking that young

take the least errour to be a
very hainous offence, past
it slightly over, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

her over with the like slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:4247:114"/>
of the third? Who made
answer that indeed she was
guilty of putting three
knives into hers. Is this all
said hee? They answered,
Yes. Then, saith he, I will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
you presently, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
quickly absolved the
two first, and comming to
the third, he began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
with himselfe, what
sheath it was which should
hold three knives, when
hee never saw any that held
more then two and a bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin;
and asked her what she

that three severall men had

               <p>Pleasant discourse betwixt a
Noble man and a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.
Lectures read by
country Gentlewomen and
Ladies to their husbands.
By the souldiers wife, to
her Captaine or Leiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
And of Court Ladies
to their Lords.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>A Nobleman and a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Merchant jesting
together freely, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
exceptions to bee taken,
saith the Nobleman to him,
I wonder at you Merchants,
who for the most part have
very beautifull and faire
wives, that dare trust them
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:4247:115"/>
here at home, whil'st you
take such long voyages into
Countries so farre remote:
surely it cannot choose but
bee a great trouble to your
minds being abroad, for
feare they should violate
their conjugall tie at home:
when wee Noblemen deale
more securely; for if we take
a journey either from the
Court to the Country, or
from the Country up to the
Court, we leave our Ladies
well accommodated &amp; guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Servants, Groomes,
and Pages. The Merchant
perceiving how hee plaid
upon him, said unto him
againe (by your Lordships
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:4247:116"/>
favour, and without offence
be it spoken) How comes it
to be a proverb, that Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
children are not (for
the most part) so well featu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and favoured, as the sons
and daughters of Citizens?
If your Lordship will not
be offended, I can shew you
the reason. I pray thee doe,
saith the Noble man, I give
thee free leave and libertie
to speake. Then thus, saith
the Merchant, In the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of all such Merchants
as have houses in the City,
it being so populous, there
are choice either of young
Aldermens sons, or of such
lusty young Gallants as use
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:4247:116"/>
to insidiate the chastities of
beautifull women in the
absence of their husbands;
and they having their choice,
will commonly picke out
the properest men to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
with; and so betwixt
them commeth a faire and
well featured issue: when
you Noblemen taking your
journeies, take all your Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
along to attend you,
leaving none with your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but a Chamberlaine,
Cooke, or a Coachman, and
they in your absence being
glad to make use of such
course groomes, I suppose
that may be the reason why
your children are not so faire
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:4247:117"/>
and well favoured as ours.
At which answer, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman
smil'd, and taking
the retort as well as the
Merchant did the jest put
upon him at first, they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
without any further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion.
But ere I come to
the Court, I must first looke
backe upon the, Country,
and see how the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
there bred useth to
lecture to her Esquire or
Knight: and after how the
Souldiers wife useth to read
to her Lievtenant o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>An Esquires wife, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an excellent housewife,
but of a very loud tongue
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:4247:117"/>
withall, used to taxe him for
being too free in his kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen,
sellar and at his table;
for keeping too many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
servants, too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
horses and dogs, hounds,
grey-hounds and spaniels,
hawkes, &amp;c. which drew
him to unnecessary char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
Then laied the law to
him, what hee might save in
the yeere, which he vainely
and profusely wasted; with
divers other things to the
like purpose, with so often
iteration (as preaching still
upon one text) both at boord
and in bed, that tired with
her continuall clamours, and
withall shee often forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:4247:118"/>
his imbraces, unlesse
he would reforme all things
according to her minde, and
leave all his estate to her
sole management, he grew
not to love her so well as
at the first, and casting his
eie upon a pretty slut, his
Gardeners wife, hee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
his own, grew very
much enamored of her, but
durst not come to the house,
by reason of his wives jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie;
yet he wrought so by
one of his servants, who
dealt for him to the woman,
that shee was willing to
yeeld to any thing to doe
her Master a pleasure, so it
might bee done safely, and
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:4247:118"/>
without suspition, either
from her husband or her
mistresse. It was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that they should
meet in a lodge some halfe
a mile from the Mannor
house, and to that purpose,
hee had sent his Gardener
some twenty miles out of
the towne; and the better
to conveigh her thither, he
commanded his man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
a large basket into
which to put the woman,
and cover it with strewing
flowers, hearbs, and sallets;
which was accordingly
done. The Master of the
house got up early to keepe
this appointment: so was
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:4247:119"/>
the Mistresse to dogge her
husband, as mistrusting his
early rising: and in the way
meets this fellow with his
basket, the bottome of
which, by reason of the
weight of the woman, was
quite broken, and her legs
and feet hung downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his knees: which shee
perceiving, call'd the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
unto her, and asked him
what hee had in his basket?
Sallets Mistresse; saith hee:
Sallets, and nothing else?
Nothing Mistresse, saith he,
but hearbs and sallets. Well
saith shee, carry them to
your Master, and tell him
from mee, this is a fish day,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:4247:119"/>
and bid him beware what
flesh hee tasteth with those
sallets. The fellow no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
perceiving all this
while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> makes way to the
lodge, and delivers his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then;
the Gentlewoman fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
and before her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
discovers the woman.
The cause was at first some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
bitterly debated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them; but all the
choler being vented, they
fell to a more mild attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
in which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
He would ever after
forsake his lust, so long as
shee would forbeare her
Lecture.</p>
            <p>A Knights wife in the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:4247:120"/>
Country was perfect in the
same doctrine, and read it as
freely as the former; and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him one morning with
a tale of an houre long, he
not interrupting her in one
syllable, she vexing all this
while that he made her no
answer, at length for meere
wearinesse she gave over.
Then he knockt as lowd as
he could, till one came up:
he then commanded him to
call up the servants of the
house, men-servants and
maid-servants, up into the
chamber, and that instantly:
who presently ran downe as
he was commanded; she in
the meane time wondring
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:4247:120"/>
what it might meane: (I
forgot to tell you that hee
bade them to bring their
Church books with them.)
Well, all of them came up
thus accommodated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
what his Worships
pleasure was? Marry (saith
he) this was the cause I sent
for you, my wife hath prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
to me a very learned
Sermon, in which she bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
somewhat of the
houre-glasse, and exceeded
her time, and it is but now
ended, and I desire it may
not goe off without a
Psalme; and therefore saith
he (and was going on) when
she interrupting him, said,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:4247:121"/>
Get you all downe about
your severall affaires, and
that I charge you instantly,
or you shall heare from me
in another kind. Which
they incontinently did:
when she, ashamed of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ricke he had put upon her,
desired him to use it or the
like no more, and she would
never trouble him either in
his nights sleep or his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
rest after.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
wife. It is recorded of
a brave and noble Captaine
to have a brauling shrew to
his wife, from which turbif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
he could by no gentle
meanes reclaime her; and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:4247:121"/>
therefore hee so awed her
with threats and menaces,
and now and then with a
kicke or a blow, that she
was forced to give her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
Lectures quite
over. Then she going often
to confession, still when she
came to her ghostly father,
in stead of her owne faults
reckoned up all that she ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
knew or could devise
of her husband. In so much
that the good man meeting
with the Captain, gave him
courteous admonitory coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
as to leave drinking,
swearing, rioting, and the
like; by which the Captaine
might perceive that some
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:4247:122"/>
or other had complained
of him. Not long after, the
woman insinuates with her
husband, that for any thing
that had ever past betwixt
them either in words or
blows, in which she was the
sole sufferer, she did heartily
forgive him, and desired the
like forgiveness from him, if
by her lowd tongue she had
any way offended him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
a reformation of all
her misdemeanours for ever
after; and therefore that
lasting unity might continue
betwixt them, she desired
him to goe to her ghostly
father, and heartily confesse
him of his sins, which would
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:4247:122"/>
be a mean to ratifie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
all conjugall love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them. The Captaine
was perswaded, and went,
and comming before the
grave Church-man, told
him he was desired to come
unto him, and now being
here (saith he) I would know
what your will is with me.
Who said, I would wish
you to consider with your
selfe, and rub up your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
and calling to
mind all your sins and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
riots and disorders, and
what else; for which (repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of them unfeignedly)
I will give you present ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.
Nay if that be all
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:4247:123"/>
(said the Captaine) that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is sav'd already, and
needs no second iteration;
I know you are my wives
Confessour, and she hath
told unto you all my sinnes,
and more than I ever did
or thought to doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready:
and so bluntly left
him.</p>
            <p>A brave Lievtenant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
many other wounds
lost an eie in the wars, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
retiring himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own Country, where
he had some meanes to live
on, bethought himself, after
all those tumultuous dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
past, to betake himselfe
to a peaceable and quiet
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:4247:123"/>
life; and to that purpose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to marry. A match
was presently offered him, a
Virgin (supposed) both of
good feature and competent
dower. The marriage day
came, and was past with
great joy and solemnity,
and the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome
(according to the
custome) brought to their
bed. The curtaines were
drawne, and they left to
their rest; when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to doe the office of an
husband, perceived she had
bin before devirginated, and
was not a true maide; and
thrusting her from him in
great anger, said, A way thou
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:4247:124"/>
strumpet, I tooke thee for a
perfect Virgin, and now I
find thee to be a woman
flaw'd and unperfect. Who

her opinion of the matter.

            <p>And such an one was
<hi>Xantippe,</hi> the wife of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi>
of whom we will speake
something, onely to shew
that there have been scolds
of old as there bee now.
Some report that hee kept

<hi>Myrtho,</hi> the other the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Xantippe.</hi> And to a
friend of his, earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
why hee kept two

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:4247:127"/>
scolding queanes, ever
brauling and chiding, and

These women teach

that I must use in sufferance
abroad: for being throughly

            <p>Upon a time, when <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tippe</hi>
in the open Market
place had plucked his cloake
from his backe, and such of
his friends as saw it, said unto
him, Why <hi>Socrates</hi> do you

            <p>Another time, one <hi>Euthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi>
a Philosopher, and
one of his most intimate
friends, comming from the
wrastling place, <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>crates</hi>
meeting with him, invited
him home to supper; the
meat being set on the table,
and they being in an earnest
discourse, more minding to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:4247:128"/>
argue than to eat; <hi>Xantippe</hi>
being therewith very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
rose up from the place
where shee sat, and wished
them choaked with their
prating, if they would not
fall to their victuals whilst
they were hot, giving her
husband very bitter and
despightfull words: but they
by custome being nothing
therewith moved, talked on:
which she seeing, tipped up
the table over and over, and
flung downe all that was
upon it to the ground, and
so went out of the roome.
But when <hi>Euthidemus,</hi> being
very much moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
offered to rise up
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:4247:129"/>
and to depart the house:
Nay stay good friend, saith
<hi>Socrates,</hi> what harme hath
shee done? did not the like
thing happen unto you the
last time you bad me home
to dinner, when an hen lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
up amongst us, cast
downe and spoyled whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was upon the table?
yet did we who were then
your guests onely laugh at
the accident, and neither
fret nor fume as you now
seeme to doe.</p>
            <p>The same <hi>Socrates,</hi> after
hee had indured his wives
bitter railing in the house,
at last being wearied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
hee went out, and sat
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:4247:129"/>
upon a bench that sided the
street doore. Shee at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
being much more
incensed, in regard of his
silence and quietnesse, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her no more argument
to speake of; she presently
(seeing where he sat) went
up into the garret, and
poured downe a chamber
pot full of stinking water
upon his head: at which
those that passed by fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a great laughter; which
seeing, he laughed as loud as
they, &amp; said, Nay, I thought

thereon, that after so loud
thunder there must needs
follow a violent shower of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:4247:130"/>
raine. But I have done with
<hi>Socrates,</hi> wishing that all
such as have the like shrewes
as hee had, might be indued
with the like patience to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
them.</p>
            <p>I come now (and that I
propose to be the conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this worke) to tell
you of a curtaine Lecture,
read by a vertuous Queene
to the King her Husband;
super-exceeding all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and worthy the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and imitation of all
good women, of what estate
and condition soever. The
Historie thus followeth.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Kings of
Arragon, there was one <hi>Don
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:4247:130"/>
Pedro</hi> (vulgarly <hi>Don Peter)</hi>
the seventh of that name; but
before his Inauguration,
Count of <hi>Barcellonas,</hi> who
tooke to wife a beautifull
young Ladie called <hi>Donna
Maria,</hi> daughter to the
Earle of Mount Pesulia, and
Nephew to the Emperour
of Constantinople; who
notwithstanding shee was
plenally furnished with all
the accomplishments both
of nature and grace; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that beautie annext with
vertue purchaseth praise
with immortality, and that
(as another saith) if chastity
and good name be lost, there
is nothing left in women that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:4247:131"/>
can be praise-worthie; and
that she knew withall, that
true vertue was the beautie
of the soule, the grace of the
bodie, and the peace of the
mind; and that it might bee
said of her, as <hi>Seneca</hi> in <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule
Furente</hi> speakes of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gera</hi>
the wife of <hi>Hercules:</hi>

                  <lg>
                     <l>Although my bodie be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest

                     <l>And famine by a lingring

                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all this
goodnesse inherent to her
greatnesse, the dissolute
King, growing neglectfull of
his first faire choice, bends
his inordinate affections ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon fresh change. Hee
sleepes now onely in the
bosomes of <hi>Catamites,</hi> and
base prostitutes; whil'st her
company and consociety
is both at boord and bed
quite abandoned.</p>
            <p>But the good Queen, lesse
troubled with the want of
his boord or bed fellowship,
than grieved with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:4247:132"/>
shee had of hopefull
and princely issue; knowing,
as <hi>Basil</hi> saith, that barren
marriage is seldome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
braules, she bethought
her selfe, how by redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the one, she might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the other. And to that
purpose she dealt privately
(being wonderously for
her vertues sake beloved of
all) with one of the Pages
of the Kings bed-chamber,
whom he most imploied in
his private prostitutions, to
bring her covertly to the
Kings bed, to supply the
place appointed for one
of his best loved mistresses.
This was as effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4247:132"/>
as considerately
plotted: so that the King
once more injoyed his
Queen, and was as prodigall
of those favours to her, as
he pretended to another.</p>
            <p>The morning growing
on, and he now sufficiently
sated, hastens her departure,
both for his owne honour
and her credit. But shee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
hold of the present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
began to discover
her selfe in these or the like
words, and read unto him
this short Lecture: My gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Lord and Husband,
if I have offended you in
the fervencie of my love, I

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing,
it was neither to
quench any immoderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
in my selfe, nor envie to
intercept any of those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
you intended unto
another: it was not lust, but
love, hoping that this nights
unexpected passage may
blesse us with issue, and
beautifie the Kingdome
with a joyfull heire. For
why should strangers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit,
where there is yet
hope left that we may have
of our own to succeed. Nor
will I leave your side till
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:4247:133"/>
you call into your chamber
some persons of honour and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rust; to the end that if hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
be so gracious unto us,
that royall fruit (by me so
much desired) may ensue by
this adventure, the world
by their testimony may
take notice, that it is legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
to crowne me with
the name of an happy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and not adulterate, to
brand mee with the title
of a lewd and lascivious
strumper.</p>
            <p>The King, though he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
somewhat troubled at
the first, yet better recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
himselfe, was not any

               </gap>eenes honest deceit: but
presently called in two
Gentlemen of his chamber,
as witnesses of that truth;
considering it touched his
own honour as much as the
Queenes desire. The event
of this stratagem proved
fortunate, both to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
and the kingdome: for
by that meeting she concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
vvith childe, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the season of vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
vvas delivered of a son,
on the first day of <hi>February</hi>
in the veere of Grace 1196.
The Father and Mother,
when the solemnity of his
Baptisme vvas to bee cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
differing about the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:4247:134"/>
name, they caused twelve
torches of equall length and
making to bee alighted at
once, they bearing the
names of the 12. Apostles;
with this <hi>omen,</hi> that the
name of that torch vvhich
vvas first burnt out, should
bee given to the Infant:
vvhich happened to be that
of S. <hi>Iames;</hi> and so was hee
called <hi>Iames,</hi> being the chief
Saint whom the <hi>Arragoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
celebrate.</p>
            <p>He proved a rare and an
unparalleld Prince, as well in
forrain warres as domestick
government: he was bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
to his servants, and
bountifull to his souldiers:
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:4247:135"/>
his courage vvas full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
and continued vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
change; proving such an
one as <hi>Socrates</hi> characters
for valiant. Great attempts
he undertooke vvithout dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
and managed them
vvithout feare. Making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion
upon the Mores, he
pierced vvith a great army
the Ile of <hi>Majorque,</hi> then in
their possession, and after
many skirmishes brought it
under his owne subjection.
Hee invaded <hi>Carihage,</hi> and
made his name famous in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had a faire and fertile
issue, sonnes and daughters.
His eldest was <hi>Don Peter,</hi>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:4247:135"/>
who succeeded him in the
kingdome of <hi>Arragon:</hi> his
second, <hi>Don Iames,</hi> whom
hee made King of the two
Iles, <hi>Majorque</hi> and <hi>Minor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que:</hi>
his third vvas Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Toledo. His eldest
daughter, <hi>Donna Tollant,</hi>
vvas Queen of Castile: the
second, <hi>Donna Isabella,</hi>
Queen of France: the third,
<hi>Donna Urracha,</hi> vvas marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Don Emanuell</hi> Prince
of Castile. His sonne <hi>Don

of the King of Navarre.
Great pity therefore it had
beene that the meeting of
that happy night had beene
intermitted, in vvhich the

it is good for wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

than to revenge it; to suffer
infirmities, and dissemble
mishaps: the one is the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of a constant sicke man,
the other of a cunning
Statesman. But for a wife to
