            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>There may be more who having helps put into their hands for this purpoſe, will not ſo much as <hi>find leaſure</hi> to make uſe of them; as if this would not indeed rather further then hinder their lawfull Affairs; or as if they could have any greater and weightier buſineſs then thus to <hi>ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near;</hi> Or as if, when the moſt in a Family will both find time and get together <hi>twice a day</hi> for <hi>ſet meals</hi> for their <hi>Bodies,</hi> they ſhould not much rather ſtrive to do ſo, <hi>once at the leaſt,</hi> for <hi>ſet and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Prayer</hi> in order to their <hi>Souls</hi> eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. If your eſtate be more plentifull you may ſpare the more time; if your condition be meaner on Earth, you have more need to ſeek by Chriſt a Treaſure in Heaven. Say not therefore, you are to provide for Wife and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and ſo have no time to regard your Soul by a ſolemn and ſerious performance of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but remember that the ſame God who commands you to follow your <hi>particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings as Men,</hi> injoins you likewiſe to follow your <hi>general Callings as Chriſtians,</hi> and that in the firſt place. <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God, and the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs <note place="margin">S.

ouſneſs thereof, and all other things ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded unto you.</hi> And alſo with the greateſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. S. <hi>John</hi> 6. 27. <hi>Labour not</hi> (i. e. not only) <hi>for the food that periſheth, but</hi> (chiefly) <hi>for the food that endureth to Everlaſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Should we pray to God <hi>every day</hi> in the week <hi>not once or twice</hi> but <hi>many times,</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Bleſſedneſs, and continue to do ſo with greateſt earneſtneſs, while our life and breath is continued, if <hi>but once</hi> this Petition at laſt be granted us, will it not be richly worth our pains, and fully requite all that we have done? Or having every Work-day in the week 23 <hi>hours and an half</hi> to eat and drink and work and ſleep in, is it any great matter to redeem <hi>half an hour</hi> or a <hi>quarter of an hours</hi> time, wherein to work out our Salvation, to prepare our Souls for Death, Judgement and Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to read ſome portion of Gods Word, and to praiſe him for the Mercies we have received, and to Pray unto him for ſuch as we have need of? If a mans houſe were in a flame he would not let it burn, and ſay, <hi>I have no time to quench it.</hi> If a Neighbour call us to ſit at our doors, to talk or dine with them we can find <hi>leaſure</hi> for it. When therefore the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God calls upon us to be diligent this way
<pb facs="tcp:31344:4"/>
among others to <hi>make our Calling and Election ſure,</hi> ſhould we fooliſhly ſay, <hi>that we have no time for this,</hi> though indeed one of the main Works which we were ſent into the World about! Oh let not ſuch vain excuſes keep us from our Duty, leſt the Righteous God for our pretending now want of <hi>time</hi> to <hi>ſerve</hi> him in, be provoked at laſt to give us an <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> to <hi>ſuffer</hi> in.</p>
            <p>Others, I fear, will be ready to make light of theſe Helps becauſe of their groundleſs prejudices againſt all Book-Prayers, not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtanding either their <hi>benefit</hi> or <hi>lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> but I beſeech you let it be well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, how many <hi>Chriſtian Duties</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> we may be <hi>daily put in mind of</hi> by theſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which if we ſtrive to follow with <hi>anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Practices,</hi> as we ought to do, and as we hereby beg of God to enable us to do; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this courſe muſt in all reaſon be allowed to have a very conſiderable influence into our more Holy and Circumſpect Walking. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides you know how natural it is to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind when they have any petitions or thanks to prefer but to an <hi>earthly King,</hi> to take good advice beforehand that they may be delivered in as <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>grave form</hi> of words, and as reverent a manner as may be; certainly then
<pb facs="tcp:31344:5"/>
Chriſtians in this reſpect ſhould be much more carefull, if poſſible, how they preſent the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of their Hearts to the <hi>moſt High God,</hi> the Eternal Majeſty of Heaven and Earth. But alas with many, ſuch have been the <hi>licentious Rambles</hi> of their fancy in <hi>ſuddain Prayer,</hi> ſo bold and rude have their deſcriptions been of Almighty God, ſo raſh their Sayings concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, or concerning themſelves, and ſo many untrue or doubtfull things have they uttered; that they have not only ſhamed that way of addreſs to God, but diſhonoured and hindered true Chriſtian Devotion, which hath ſuffered extremely in the thoughts of many by ſuch extravagance. And ſome, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath ſhewn, finding that they could not pray in their Families <hi>ex tempore</hi> or <hi>on the ſudden</hi> as they have been urged, without many vain repetitions and broken impertinent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, have quite left off the Duty it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Tis true ſome few may attain an habit of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering their Deſires freely and becomingly upon any occaſion; yet the moſt, though well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded People, are ſo defective both in their <hi>Conceptions and Utterance,</hi> that they greatly need the Aſſiſtance which is here offered them, and ought by no means to be diſcouraged from
<pb facs="tcp:31344:5"/>
performing thus ſafely and piouſly their known Duty towards God; eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that when we pray for ſuch things as are contained in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> which are from the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> and when by the ſame Bleſſed Spirit helping our infirmities, we are enabled to Pray for thoſe things <hi>fervently and ſincerely,</hi> we do truly pray by the <hi>Gift</hi> or <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit,</hi> whether the Prayer we uſe be written in a Book, or imprinted in the Memory, or ſuddenly uttered; and ſuch a Prayer is acceptable unto God who looks not at the <hi>outward varied expreſſions</hi> of the Tongue, but the <hi>inward holy Affections</hi> of the Heart. And ſo our Saviour pray'd in or by the Spirit, when he repeated the ſame requeſts at ſeveral times; and ſo ſtill do all plain and honeſt-hearted People, when they devoutly uſe <hi>that form of Prayer</hi> which he hath taught us, or any other after that manner judiciouſly compoſed.</p>
            <p>The Prayers, Directions, and Catechiſms of the following Book, I have for the moſt part collected out of ſeveral approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of great Judgement, Learning, Piety, and Chriſtian experience, only fitting them with needfull <hi>Alterations</hi> and <hi>Additions</hi> for your eaſier uſe and benefit. And in the whole
<pb facs="tcp:31344:6"/>
you have comprehended thoſe things which make for your greater Holineſs here and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs hereafter; which are often more fully explained by the <hi>publick Miniſtry</hi> of the Word; and which agree with the ſenſe of the moſt and beſt Chriſtians in the truly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick or univerſall Church, beginning at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and diſperſed throughout <note place="margin">S. Luke 24. 47.</note> the whole Chriſtian World. Yet I doubt not but many deceivers and deceived who have caſt off the Ordinances of Chriſt, and lately taken up a <hi>new Religion</hi> of their own deviſing, building their <hi>Altars of falſe Worſhip</hi> beſides the <hi>Altar of the Lord,</hi> theſe will be ready to revile me for my pains, to call me Deceiver, as ſome did the Apoſtles themſelves, to prate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly againſt me, and to oppoſe and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay what I am doing, that they may hinder your being benefited thereby. But I beſeech you, do you <hi>hold faſt the form of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 8.</note> 
               <hi>ſound Words</hi> or Chriſtian Doctrine which you have received in Faith and Love which is in Chriſt Jeſus; adhere to the Spirit, Miniſtry, and Ordinances of Chriſt; keep in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of his Saints and People; and as you have the <hi>true Religion,</hi> ſo be <hi>true unto</hi> your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> by living accordingly, and my Soul for yours, by the Grace of God, you ſhall not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.

                           <p>O Moſt holy and ever bleſſed Lord God, we thine unworthy Servants do here acknowledge, that as we were born in ſin, ſo we have lived in iniquity, and broken thy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Laws in thought, word, and deed, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing too much the deſires of our own will, and not caring as we ought to be governed by thy Holy Word and Spirit; but O gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Father, we beſeech thee for the merits of thy Dear Son to forgive us all our ſins, and not to inflict upon us thoſe Puniſhments which are due unto us for them. And do thou we pray Thee ſanctifie us throughout in Body, Soul, and Spirit, and lead us in the ways of Truth and Holineſs, and make us in every reſpect ſuch as thou wouldeſt have us to be.</p>
                           <p>And here, O Lord, from the bottom of our hearts we praiſe thy Name for all thy Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings beſtowed upon us, concerning this or a better Life; Particularly we praiſe Thee for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31344:14"/>
the Mercies of the laſt Night and this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; that thou haſt preſerved us from ſuch dangers as might have fallen upon any of us; and for our Refreſhment by moderate reſt and ſleep. Oh that this Day we may be kept from the evil of Sin, and ſo, if it may be thy Will, from the evil of Puniſhment. Enable us to watch over our Thoughts, that good Meditations only may enter into our minds, and Holy deſires and purpoſes into our Hearts. Help us to ſet a watch before our Mouths, and to keep the door of our Lips that we offend not with our Tongues.</p>
                           <p>Help us alſo to watch over all our Actions, that we may do hurt to none, but all the good we can to all, as we would have others deal with us, That in all we do thy Word may be our Rule, thy Spirit our Guide, our Saviour our pattern, and thy Glory our end. That we may be wiſe and modeſt in our Carriage, temperate and ſober in our Diet, diligent and chearfull in our Buſineſs; that we may abide with Thee in our particular Places and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings by a conſcientious performance of the Duties thereof; that we may undertake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon which we may not deſire thy Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and wherein we may not expect thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Aſſiſtance.</p>

That we may be crucified to the World, and the World unto us, by the Croſs of Chriſt; that we may be content with ſuch things as we have, and not uſe any unlawfull means for our own relief, knowing Thou haſt promiſed, never to leave us nor forſake us. That we may ſo paſs through the things of this Life, that finally we looſe not Everlaſting Life and Happineſs in the enjoyment of thy Self. And all we beg upon the account of Chriſt, in whoſe Name we continue to pray unto Thee, ſaying, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                           <p>O Lord, the Creator of the World, and the Redeemer of Mankind, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all things, and canſt do what thou pleaſeſt,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31344:17"/>
and haſt done us very much Good already, and promiſed to do more for us, if we be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, then we can ask or think; we here fall down before Thee in the loweſt manner, to expreſs our fear and reverence to thy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power; our admiration of and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to thy unſearchable Wiſdom; our hearty love, and thankfull acknowledgment of thy wondrous Goodneſs; our truſt and confidence in thy Faithfull Promiſes; with our ready and ſincere purpoſes to perform all Obedience to thy holy Commands.</p>
                           <p>There is nothing, O Lord, ſo afflictive to us, as the remembrance that we have at any time offended thy Sovereign Authority. We are heartily ſorry for the breaking any of thy Righteous and Good Laws, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech Thee for the ſake of Chriſt to pardon the ſame unto us, and that we may abhor the thoughts of doing ſo again, ever reſolving by thy Aſſiſtance to deny all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live Righteouſly, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and Godly in this preſent World; and to ſtrive to be like our Saviour Chriſt in meekneſs and lowlineſs of Spirit, in Purity and Zeal for thy Worſhip and Glory, and in being ready as we have opportunity, to take the more pains that we may do the more good in the World.</p>

                           <p>O let us be ſo ſenſible of thy great kindneſs to us, &amp; of our many engagements unto Thee, that we may love thee our God and Saviour with all our heart, ſoul, and ſtrength; that we may ſtrive to credit our Religion, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thy Name all the ways we are able, with all that we are, have, or can do; that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the ſpecial Duties of thy Worſhip, but alſo by the right management of our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Affairs, and our moderate uſe of the good things of this Life, we may ſerve Thee, and be brought nearer unto Thee.

                           <p>Free us, O Lord, from all inordinate cares for the things of this Life; from all diſtruſt of thy good Providence; from all repining at any thing that befalls us; and enable us in every thing to give Thanks; believing that all things are ordered by the greateſt Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſhall work together for the good of thoſe that love Thee. We doubt not of thy Fatherly Affection to thoſe that ſtudy in all ſincerity to approve themſelves unto Thee; and therefore ſtill reſolve to leave our ſelves entirely to thy wiſe Counſels, that thou mayſt diſpoſe us into ſuch a condition as thou ſeeſt beſt in this World.

                           <p>Give, we pray Thee, repentance unto Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and increaſe of Grace and Strength to all thy faithfull Servants; Reduce thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us that wander out of the way; raiſe up thoſe that are fallen; confirm and ſettle thoſe that ſtand, and grant them a ſtedfaſt Reſolution to perſevere in Faith, Love, and Obedience.

Aſſiſt thoſe that are Dying and leaving this World, and fit their Souls for a better Place; and let us alſo with them after our own laſt ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in due time through Chriſt, obtain a glorious Reſurrection and Eternal Life.</p>
                           <p>And here, O Lord, we do from our very Souls render unto Thee moſt humble and hearty thanks for all thy Bleſſings and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits beſtowed upon us concerning this Life and that which is to come; but more eſpecially we praiſe Thee for the mercies of this day; for any meaſure of ſucceſs thou haſt given us in our lawfull Endeavours; that thou haſt defended us from ſuch dangers as might have fallen upon us.

                           <p>That thou wouldeſt give us an univerſal Good Will towards others in the World; that we may love our Neighbours as our Selves, and love even our Enemies for thy ſake; and be more carefull that we do hurt unto none, but deal juſtly and mercifully to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all, as we would that they ſhould do unto us.</p>

Nor laid to heart, as I ought, thine infinite Love in Chriſt my Redeemer: Nor duly followed the godly Motions of thy Holy Spirit, which thou haſt ſent to renew and ſanctifie my Affections, and draw me to thine Obedience. I have not lived up to the Faith which I profeſs, but behaved my ſelf too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as if I neither dreaded the threatned Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:31344:30"/>
nor duly valued the promiſed glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious rewards of my Lord Chriſt, who will judge the World in Righteouſneſs, and render to every one according to their Works. O Lord, I have done ſo much Evil, and ſo little Good; been ſo eager in the purſuit of the things of this World, and ſo cold and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned many times about thoſe of Eternity; ſo unmindfull of my promiſes, unthankfull for thy Benefits, and unfruitfull in the Knowledge of Chriſt, that it is a wonder of thy Patience and Goodneſs, that I am ſtill alive, and not cut down like a barren Tree that cumbers the ground; that I am not lamenting theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in weeping and gnaſhing of teeth, which I now mention with ſo little ſorrow and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of Spirit. For ever adored be thy forbearing Mercy, which hath ſo long ſpared me an unprofitable ſervant, who have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways in thought, word, and deed, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thy Divine Majeſty. <note n="*" place="margin">Here reckon up thoſe particular ſins which thou art conſcious of.</note> Oh continue I beſeech thee to be gracious unto me, and for Jeſus his ſake give me a truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and believing Heart; and by the vertue of that Sacrifice of himſelf, which he offered once for the ſins of the World, let all my ſins be done away and remembred no more.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:31344:31"/>
And for this and all other thy great Mercies, I reſolve to offer unto Thee by Chriſt, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of continual Praiſe and Thankſgiving, and I preſent my body a living Sacrifice, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, acceptable unto Thee, which is my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Service; And I dedicate my ſelf ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to thy Obedience; Oh therefore give me Grace ever to fear Thee, and to walk humbly with Thee, and to preſerve a tender ſenſe of my Duty towards Thee.</p>
                           <p>O Lord, I purpoſe by thy Aſſiſtance, that hereafter I will never willingly depart from thy Precepts; oh do thou ſtrengthen me to perform what I have purpoſed; that I may never be ſo unreaſonable as to return to thoſe ſins which are the burden of my Heart; and grieve thy Holy Spirit; which rent the Fleſh, and ſhed the Blood of the Lord Jeſus; and which I have ſo often, and ſo ſolemnly prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted againſt.</p>
                           <p>And now that I am going to thy Holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to commemorate the Sacrifice of my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to remember his love in Dying for me; to give thee further teſtimonies of my love to Thee; and receive new tokens of thy Love to me: O Lord, vouchſafe to make thy ſelf powerfully preſent to my Mind. Repreſent thy ſelf, and thy Son Jeſus ſo lively to my

Imprint the very image of thy Son upon me; that I may carry him ever in my Heart, and have his life and death continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before mine Eyes; and in all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my ſelf to his Will, and faſhion my ſelf after his Holy Example. Come, Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and poſſeſs thy ſelf of my whole Man. Purifie me from all remaining filthineſs either of the Fleſh or Spirit. Bring in all thy Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Graces along with thee into my Soul. And be my perpetual Defence, by giving me a fuller communication of thy Holy Spirit, and more mighty aides to do my duty towards Thee, and towards all Men.</p>
                           <p>And for that end, compoſe my unſetled thoughts before I approach to receive the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Myſteries; that I may attend Thee with a full and clear conception of their meaning; with an actual Belief of thy whole Goſpel; with moſt ſenſible love to thee, and deſire to be more like thee; with thy high Praiſes in my mouth, and joy unſpeakable in my heart.

            <head>Some brief helps to Meditation in Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FIrſt,</hi> When the Sermon is ended, and thou art adreſſing thy ſelf to the Banquet of the Lords Supper, meditate how lovingly thou art invited to be a gueſt at this Holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Hoe, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters; Come, buy Wine and Milk without money, and without price: Eat ye that which is Good, and let your Soul delight it ſelf in Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Take, Eat, this is my Body which is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for you; Drink ye all of this; for this is my Blood which was ſhed for the Remiſsion of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As <hi>Abraham</hi> when he went up to the Mount to ſacrifice <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Son, left his ſervants beneath in the Valley: So when thou comeſt to the ſpiritual commemorative Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Lords-Supper, lay aſide all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts and cogitations, that thou mayeſt wholly contemplate of Chriſt, and offer up thy Soul to him, who Sacrificed both his Soul and Body for thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Set thy ſelf as in the <hi>Preſence of God,</hi> with awfull and reverent thoughts of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31344:33"/>
thy <hi>crucified Lord.</hi> If the bleſſed Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter,</hi> ſeeing but a glimpſe of Chriſts Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, thought himſelf unworthy to ſtand in the ſame Boat with him? how unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy art thou to ſit with Chriſt at the ſame Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, where thou mayeſt behold ſo much of his infinite Grace and Mercy diſplayed? Yet if thou comeſt <hi>humbly,</hi> in <hi>Faith, Repentance</hi> and <hi>Charity, abhorring</hi> thy <hi>ſins paſt,</hi> and <hi>purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing unfeignedly to amend thy life henceforth,</hi> let not thy former ſins affright thee, for they ſhall never be laid to thy Charge; and this Sacrament ſhall ſeal to thy Soul, that all thy ſins are fully pardoned, and clean waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Blood of Chriſt. For this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was not ordained for them who are perfect; but to help penitent ſinners towards Perfection. <hi>Chriſt came not to call the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous but Sinners to Repentance.</hi> And he ſaith, That the <hi>whole need not the Phyſician,</hi> but <hi>they that are ſick.</hi> Bathe thou therefore thy Soul in this <hi>fountain</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Blood;</hi> and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, according to the Promiſe, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Thou ſhalt be healed of</hi> all thy <hi>ſins</hi> and <hi>unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</hi> Not ſinners, but they who are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to repent of their ſins, are debarred this Holy Ordinance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> When the Miniſter begins to read
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:31344:33"/>
the ſentences of Scripture before the Offerto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, let them be conſidered by thee to ſtirr up thy Charity to the Poor. Let Gods bounty to thee in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> provoke thy Mercy to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>Temporals.</hi> Hoping to be refreſhed with the ſaving benefits of Chriſts Death; be willing to thy Power to refreſh the bowels of his poor Members: <hi>What we do to them, we do to Chriſt;</hi> and who would not thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt, who made himſelf Poor to make us Rich in the beſt things?</p>
            <p>And now the <hi>Sacrament</hi> being <hi>begun</hi> to be adminiſtred, apply thy ſelf with <hi>diligent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi> and <hi>fervent Devotion</hi> to go along with the Miniſter in all Actions, Rites, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Confeſſions, Readings, Exhortations, or Thanksgivings, which are uſed in, and about the Holy Sacrament.</p>
            <p>When therefore thou ſeeſt the Miniſter <hi>putting apart</hi> Bread and Wine on the Lords Table, and conſecrating them by Prayers, and rehearſal of the words of <hi>Chriſts Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to be an <hi>holy Sacrament</hi> of the bleſſed Body and Blood of Chriſt; then meditate, how <hi>God the Father,</hi> of his meer love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, did <hi>ſet apart</hi> and ſeal his only begotten Son, to be the <hi>All-ſufficient means,</hi> and only Mediator to redeem us from ſin, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31344:34"/>
us to Himſelf, and to bring us to Glory.</p>
            <p>When thou ſeeſt him <hi>break the Bread;</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate how Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>put to death</hi> as to his humane Nature; and his bleſſed Body wounded and pierced, and both Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as we may ſay, broken aſunder for our ſins; and withall, call to mind the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, and the greatneſs of Gods ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt them, ſeeing his Juſtice could not be ſatisfied but by ſuch a Sacrifice.</p>
            <p>When he is <hi>drawing towards Thee</hi> with the conſecrated Bread, and offering it unto thee, then meditate, that Chriſt himſelf cometh unto thee, and both offereth, and giveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unto thy Faith, Himſelf, and all the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Death</hi> and Paſſion, to feed thy Soul unto Eternal life. <hi>The bread of the Lord</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the Miniſter; but the <hi>Bread which is the Lord</hi> is given by Chriſt himſelf.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>I ſee the Symbols, the</hi> Holy Bread, <hi>and the</hi> bleſſed Cup, <hi>but I alſo think of thy Authority or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining theſe Rites; of thy voice bleſſing theſe Symbols, of thy Mercy reaching out my pardon, thy Holy Spirit ſanctifying my Spirit, thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Self making interceſſion for me at the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Altar in Heaven.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Here before the <hi>Cup</hi> be brought to thee thou mayeſt uſe one or more of the foregoing <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculations.</hi> Thou mayeſt alſo have time to bleſs God for the Death of Chriſt; to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon his Sufferings; to admire the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his <hi>Love in dying</hi> for thee, reſolving to take the Cup of Salvation, and to pledge his love with love; to <hi>renew thy Covenants</hi> with God, to reinforce thy purpoſes of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Obedience; to beg of God ſtrength to performe ſuch Duties as thou haſt formerly neglected, againſt ſuch ſins and temptations as have too eaſily prevailed againſt thee; to pray alſo for all Patience under ſuch troubles and afflictions as may befall thee before another Sacrament Day come about.</p>
            <p>Having received the Cup at the Miniſters hand, in the <hi>inſtant of Drinking,</hi> and as ſoon after it as may be, meditate on Chriſts Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Bleeding upon the Croſs; <hi>giving him hearly thanks for his love in Dying for us.</hi> And having poured the Sacramental Wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy ſtomach, ſay with thy ſelf, <hi>As verily as I have received this Wine, ſo certainly Chriſts

Paſtor: <hi>My advice to you is this. See that you obey your</hi> faithfull Teachers, <hi>and improve their help for your Salvation while you have it;</hi> and take heed that you refuſe not to learn when they would teach you. And in particular, ſee that you refuſe not to ſubmit to them in this Duty of <hi>private Inſtruction.</hi> Go to them when they deſire you, and be thankfull for their help. Yea, at other times when you need their Advice, go to them of your own accord, and ask it. Their Office is to be your Guides in the way of Life. If you ſeek not their direction, it ſeems you either deſpiſe Salvation it ſelf, or elſe you are ſo proud as to think your ſelves ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to be your own Directors. Shall God in Mercy ſend you Leaders to teach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you in the way to Glory, and will you ſtoutly ſend them back, or refuſe their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſay, <hi>we have no need of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?</hi> Is it (ſays he) for their own eaſe or gain that they trouble you, or is it for your own everlaſting Gain? Remember that Chriſt hath ſaid to his Meſſengers, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi> If your obſtinate refuſal of their Inſtruction do put any of them to bear witneſs againſt you in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſay <hi>(Lord, I would have taught

            <p>I Believe that there is one only true God, who is a Spirit infinitely glorious, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>One</hi> in Nature, is yet <hi>Three</hi> in Perſons; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; which are <hi>three</hi> and <hi>one</hi> after a wonderfull and <hi>myſterious</hi> manner.

            <p>I believe that Mankind being fallen by ſin from God and Happineſs, under the wrath of God, the curſe of his Law, and the power of the Devil, <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only Son</hi> to be their Redeemer; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and one with the Father, became Man alſo in the ſame Perſon, by taking to him our Nature; as to which he was concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Holy Ghoſt of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and born of her without ſin, and named <hi>Jeſus

            <p>And having ordained and appointed that all that truly repent, and believe in Him, and love him above all things, and ſincerely obey him, and that to the death, ſhall be ſaved; and that they that will not ſhall be damned; and commanded his <hi>Miniſters</hi> to publiſh thus much, and to preach the Goſpel to the World; he will come again, and <hi>raiſe</hi> the bodies of all Men from death, and will <hi>judge all men</hi> according to what they have done in the Body.</p>
            <p>I believe that God the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son, was ſent by them to <hi>inſpire</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> the Prophets and Apoſtles, that they might <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reveal</hi> the Doctrine of Chriſt, and by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of <hi>evident Miracles</hi> to be the great witneſs of Chriſt, and of the Truth of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word; and alſo to dwell and work in all that are drawn to believe; that being firſt

            <p>
               <hi>FIrſt,</hi> When thou findeſt thy ſelf <hi>viſited</hi> with <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> thou art preſently to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it is God who <hi>with rebukes doth chaſten Man for ſin,</hi> and therefore let thy firſt care be to find out what it is that provokes him to ſmite thee; and to that purpoſe <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine diligently</hi> thine own heart and ways, and <hi>confeſs</hi> thy <hi>ſins</hi> humbly and penitently unto God, begging moſt earneſtly his Mercy and Pardon in Chriſt Jeſus, and putting on ſincere

and <hi>zealous Reſolutions</hi> of forſaking every evil way for the reſt of that time which God ſhall ſpare thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That your own Heart deceive you not in this ſo weighty a buſineſs which is for Eternity, it will be your Wiſdom, before your Diſeaſe prevail <hi>too much</hi> upon you, to ſend for ſome <hi>godly Divine,</hi> your <hi>own Miniſter eſpecially,</hi> under whoſe care you live, and who may be beſt acquainted with your Condition; uſing his help to <hi>ſettle your Conſcience</hi> aright, and to make your Peace with God. And to that end, open your heart ſo <hi>freely</hi> unto him that he may be able to judge, whether your Repentance be ſuch, as may give you Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to appear before Gods dreadfull Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and if it be not, that he may <hi>help you</hi> what he can towards the making of it ſo.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Take notice that I have not here ſet down any Prayers for the Sick, as is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done in ſuch Books of Devotion, becauſe <hi>I would have Neighbours oftner to acquaint me with their ſickneſs, in order to my Viſiting of them;</hi> And then as occaſion ſhall require, I ſhall be ready to help them to ſuch <hi>Prayers and Meditations</hi> as may be <hi>ſutable</hi> to their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> which they may make uſe of in my abſence.</p>
