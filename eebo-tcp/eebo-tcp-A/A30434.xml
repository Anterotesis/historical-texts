            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Psal. Lxxxv. Ver. 8.</bibl>
               <q>I will hear what God the Lord will speak, for he
will speak Peace unto his People, and to his
Saints: but let them not turn again to Folly.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN all the various Turns of <hi>David</hi>'s Life, we
find him neither so much lifted up with
Success, nor depressed with Misfortune,
that he went off from that Confidence in
God, which was his Basis, and on which
all his Hopes rested;<note place="margin">Psal. 3. 6.</note> when he was beset <hi>with ten
thousands of people that had compased him round
about, he was not afraid, but laid himself down in
peace and slept,<note place="margin">Psal. 4. 8.</note> for it was God only that made him
to dwell in safety:</hi> and when his Afflictions grew
so high,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 30. 6.</note> that once his own People <hi>spake of stoning
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65711:5"/>
him, yet even then when he had fainted, unless he had
believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land
of the living, he encouraged himself in the Lord his
God:</hi> And when a happy reverse of his affairs
raised him to a vast Elevation, and a Series of
great Successes covered him with so much Glory,
that all his Enemies did fall or fly before him;
this change of his condition wrought no change
in his mind, unless it were to the better, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying
the hours of that Tranquillity which he
had procured to himself, and to his People, in
composing this Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> in which by a
happy intermixture of the two charmingest things
in the World, <hi>Poetry</hi> and <hi>Musick,</hi> he studied to
raise in himself and in his People, the loftiest
Thoughts of God, and the most grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
of his Mercies that was possible.</p>
            <p>There is somewhat in Misfortune and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that gives Men naturally a Cast towards
Religion and Devotion. For, the Mind being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in upon it self, and forced to think much,
if it is apt to be overcharged with Melancholy,
then it encreases its trouble by severe Thoughts,
drawn from the Considerations of Religion; but
if it is naturally gay and cheerful, then it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
it self with such a pleasant prospect of
Hope, as Religion proposes. Thus it is so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all men in trouble to look towards God,
that unless the mind is strongly fortified against
those Impressions, they will then break in upon
it. But the Charms of Ease and Prosperity, of
Greatness and Glory, do soon deface all those
good thoughts, which arise out of blacker cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances;
the mind stays no more within it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65711:5"/>
self, but is softened with pleasures, and dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with business or folly, and retains neither its
former wise thoughts nor good resolutions; yea,
that very Devotion which was ones Sanctuary and
Relief in the evil day, becomes matter of Raillery
in the daies of mirth and gaiety.</p>
            <p>How different from all this was this great
King, who though he was raised from a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to an high dignity, which often brings a
Giddiness over weak minds, that cannot bear such
an unlookt-for progress in their Fortunes, and
that extraordinary Merits, a high Courage, a wise
Conduct, and great Vertues made, that his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
might be considered, as the Effect as
well as the Reward of his worth; yet he ascribes
all his Deliverances, all his Victories, and all his
Glory, wholly to the Goodness of God, and to
his great designs, in which he was employed as
an Instrument, that how glorious soever it might
be, was yet only an Instrument in the hands of
that Eternal Mind that raises up and uses all
persons in subserviency to those ends, for which
all things were made, and do still subsist. In
these his Raptures he did not think it would
derogate from his glory, to acknowledg, that
<hi>he did not trust in his Bow, neither did his Sword
save him,</hi> but that it was God <hi>that had saved
him from his Enemies, and had put them to shame
that hated him; that God was his Refuge and
Strength; that vain was the strength of man; that
a King was not delivered by the multitude of an
Host, nor was a mighty man delivered by much
Strength; that God was his Deliverer, and his
Shield, in whom he trusted, that subdued the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65711:6"/>
under him that gave salvation to Kings, and
that delivered David his servant from the hurtful
sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conquests and the Treasures of <hi>David</hi>
are perhaps, Objects which strike the minds of
some Princes, while his Courage and his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
raise a nobler Ambition in others. But
alas, shall his Piety and Devotion have no force
to work on great Minds, raised to great Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
who, how much soever they may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
above the rest of Mankind, yet still in
comparison to God, and when put <hi>in the ballance
with him, they are altogether lighter than vanity.</hi>
What a new face would the World put on, if
it were governed by Princes of such a temper,
as appears in <hi>David,</hi> when he composed this
Psalm, of which my Text is a part. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
it with a grateful remembrance of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances
of former times, and particularly of
their being redeemed out of the Bondage their
Fathers suffered in the Land of <hi>Egypt. Lord,
thou hast been favourable unto thy land, thou hast
brought back the captivity of Iacob, thou hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered
all their sin, thou hast taken away all thy wrath,
thou hast turned thy self from the fierceness of
thine anger.</hi> These are both acknowledgments
of past Mercies, and encouragements to hope for
a return of the like Blessings, since such extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
favours were marks of a particular
care and kindness that seemed to watch over
them. From these he proceeds to an earnest
Intercession for the People, who it seems were
then under signal characters of God's displeasure:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65711:6"/>
               <hi>Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine
anger towards us to cease: Wilt thou be angry with
us for ever? Wilt thou draw out thine anger to
all generations? Wilt thou not revive us again,
that thy people may rejoyce in thee? Shew us thy
mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.</hi> Words
of great tenderness, that express both a deep
sense of God's anger, and a most earnest desire
of being again restored to his favour! After
these comes my Text, which carries in it a Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Allusion to the consulting of the Cloud of
Glory, which was between the Cherubims, and to
the receiving Answers from it, upon all critical occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.
<hi>David</hi> turned his thoughts from all the other
views, he might have, to this, <hi>I will hear what God the
Lord will speak,</hi> that so he might depend wholly
on the assurances that he should receive of God's
favour, upon the Repentance and Prayers of the
People; and in consideration of God's Covenant
with them, he knew the answer would be <hi>Peace;</hi>
which being the form of Salutation in those
Ages, among Friends, imported an intire recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.
So that by <hi>speaking Peace,</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
an assurance of God's love and favour
to <hi>his People, and to his Saints;</hi> that is, to the
People that was <hi>sanctified,</hi> and dedicated to the
service of God by so many federal Rites. The
words that follow are capable of different ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings,
either thus, <hi>to his Saints, and to such as
turn not again to folly,</hi> or, <hi>and they shall not turn
again to folly;</hi> or as it is in our Translation, and
<hi>let them not turn again unto folly.</hi> The LXX.
Interpreters differ much more, but the enlarging
on any account of those various rendrings, would
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65711:7"/>
require too long and too dry a Discourse for a
day of this kind.<note place="margin">Psal. 14. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Folly</hi> in Scripture stands often
for Atheism and Impiety;<note place="margin">Jer. 5. 21. &amp; 10. 8. &amp; 23. 13.</note> 
               <hi>The fool has said in
his heart, that there is not a God.</hi> Sometimes
for Idolatry, there being no instance of folly
that is more extravagant, than the giving divine
Honours to the works of Mens Hands, or to
the Fictions of their vain Imaginations: but
most commonly the irregularities of Vice are set
forth in Scipture under this notion, to shew how
contrary they are to all the Principles of true
Reason that are in our natures. The words
being thus opened, lead me to speak to these
Three Heads.</p>
            <p>I. That the great security and happiness of a
Nation depends on its being at peace with
God, and in his favour; and that its greatest
danger and misery arises out of God's anger
and displeasure.</p>
            <p>II. That therefore it is necessary to use most
earnest and fervent Prayers, for removing
God's anger, and for the procuring his favour:
And that our great encouragements to this,
are the remembrance of past Deliverances,
and the consideration of the Attributes of
God, who is naturally gracious and merciful.</p>
            <p>III. That a Nation which would secure to
it self the continuance of God's favour, and
of all the Blessings that accompany it, must
above all things take care of not relapsing into
Vice and Idolatry, Ungodliness and Atheism.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65711:7"/>
To return: <hi>The greatest Security and Happiness
of a Nation, depends on its being at peace with
God, and in his favour: And its greatest Danger
and Misery arises out of God's anger and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
Either this is true (let our Scoffers make
it the subject of their profane Mirth as much
as they will) or there is nothing true in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
If God is infinitely Wise and Perfect,
and if he made the World, which they pretend
to own, then certainly he still takes care of it:
For no body can deny a Providence, that does
not likewise in his heart deny a God, and a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Prejudices against Providence arise
chiefly from the narrowness of our Minds,
that cannot conceive how one Being can have
an extended and universal care of all things:
But is not the prejudice of a blind Man against
the possibility of seeing, as well grounded?
For how extravagant must this appear to him,
that through so small a passage as the Pupil of
the Eye, such a vast variety of Objects should
enter at once, and open themselves within the
body of the Eye without confusion, and there
be represented to us in their just figures, with their
distance from us, and from one another; and
in their Colours, which he cannot understand
neither, and that thus at a great distance we can
reason and judge of things: To one that pe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
nothing but by touch, this will appear
very unconceivable. If then the good disposition
of an Organ raises one Man so far above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he cannot apprehend how such an
extent of perception is possible, it is a most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65711:8"/>
thing to conclude against any Perfection
in the Divine Mind, because it is beyond our
compass of thought. The other prejudice against
Providence seems a little better grounded, which
is, That in the government of the World there
is such an irregularity, that it cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to flow from a Good and a Wise Being:
But this is likewise an effect of the shortness
of our Prospect, we seeing only things that are
before us, but not being able to guide our Eye
further to the end of the Scene, nor to what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions
or Catastrophes are abiding those who
at present seem covered with Success and Glory.
But if we believe God to be the infinitely Pure
and Holy, we must likewise believe that he
loves those that are truly good, and are confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to his own nature, and that he has an
aversion to those who are contrary to it, and
that are defiled and impure: For the Principle
of Self-love that is natural to every Being, makes
it love such as resemble it, and hate such as are
in an opposition to it; not by a hatred of anger
and fury, which is the effect of Passion and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
by a hatred which arises out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
of nature that is between them. It is then,
as certain as that there is a God, that he is perfectly
Pure and Holy, and that by consequence such
Nations as are vertuous and innocent, that are
neither false nor cruel, vicious nor dissolute,
must be more acceptable to him, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
protected by him, than those that are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by sensuality and luxury into all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacies
of humane Nature, and into a scorn of
Religion and Vertue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65711:8"/>
But though it is certain, that such debauched
Nations are under the Divine Displeasure, yet as
to the properest time, and the suitablest circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
in which God will pour out his Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
upon them; and as to the ballancing of
the sins of one Nation against another, and the
delivering one over to be plagued by another, till
the one is purged, and the other has filled up the
measure of its Iniquities, those are Secrets lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in that Infinite mind, into which our sight
can carry us but a very little way.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, if there is a God that
made the World, he governs it; and if he is wise
and holy, he must govern it so as to favour the
Good, and to hate the Wicked. If any object
to this, the long-flourishing of the <hi>Turkish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi>
and the strange Progress and Success of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometism,</hi>
the Answer is plain enough, That the
<hi>Eastern Christians</hi> were so far degenerated from
all that is pure and noble in the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that they were become a Reproach to
it, and therefore God has delivered them up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
so long a Captivity, and has rewarded the
Temperance, the Justice, and the Aversion to
Idolatry, that are among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> with
so long a course of Prosperity. If the Reign of
some Princes, that have broken through the Faith
of Oaths and Treaties, and through all the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred'st
Rules of Justice and Mercy, has hitherto
had a course of Success and Glory, to which we
find nothing that can be compared in History
since <hi>Augustus</hi>'s days; yet even to this it must
be said, That we can form no true Judgment of
it till we see to the end of it: And even this is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65711:9"/>
only a Personal Success, for that the Nation that
is the Scene of that Prince's Glory, may suffer as
much under him, if not more, than it could have
done from any Enemy; since all the Protection
that they enjoy under him is, that they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from the Impressions of others that they
may be the entire Prey of the Lawless Power,
that devours them and all their Substance, and
employs it in the support of his Injustice and
Cruelty. Besides, the great decays of true
Religion among all those Churches that carry the
Name <hi>Reformed,</hi> may have required an exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
chastisement to awaken and parifie them; and
the slow progress that they make in this, may
have occasioned so long a continuance and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of Glory in him whom God has made the
Rod of his Anger for correcting them But when
that end of Providence is once fulfilled, we may
then reasonably hope to see that Persecutor, who
is swelled up upon his success, become the object
of as much Scorn as he has been hitherto of
Flattery. But alas! our Impenitence and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
keeps off still that day, and our Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Vices do still feed his Pride, and furnish
him new matter of Triumph and Glory.</p>
            <p>In a word, nothing needs be further said for
a fuller proof of this matter, than that those
very Sins that provoke the wrath of God, do
likewise dissolve and corrupt all that is great or
noble in human nature; falshood dissolves the
mutual Confidences and Union of a Nation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which it must act feebly and move irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
as a disjointed body. Cruelty brings a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity
on mens natures, which makes them inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65711:9"/>
of prudent and wise Counsels. Sensuality
takes away mens Hearts, their Courage, and
their Spirit. But above all things, a brutal Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
and scorn of Religion cuts all the Banks
and Fences of Human Society, and not only sets
men loose to all their Appetites and Passions, by
taking off all inward checks and restraints, but
begets a sort of boisterousness and insolence in their
Tempers, so that they become incapable of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Conduct, and equally unfit both for
Council and Execution.</p>
            <p>How much of all this belongs to us is but too
visible! Would to God it were but a Secret, and
not too notorious and publick! Where is the
ancient gravity and composure of Behaviour that
made a large part of the Character of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Where is the Truth and Fidelity which
was formerly one of the distinctions of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glishmen?</hi>
Where is the Good-nature and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity
that was the Ornament of those that
were nobly born? Where are even the Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of Religion, or of the Worship of God?
What is become of the Love of our Country,
and of its ancient Government and Liberty?
Has not this shameful Degeneracy of our Morals
brought us so low, that there is scarce Virtue
enough left, and men enough to be found, that
have even a general Tincture of it to save a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Sensuality has run many into such a deep
Arrear for Vice, that they cannot be true neither
to publick nor private Engagements, and then
Imployments will be made the Robberies of the
Publick, and Vice will swallow up all that
Strength and Treasure which should go to the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65711:10"/>
support of the Nation. Men are pleased or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
only as their Vices are fed or starved:
Some pretend to be Patriots that are so eminent
for Vice, that a Government fixt, and strong
enough to reform the Nation, must throw them
off as the Scum and Reproaches of it: For let
those Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> say what they will, Atheism
and Impiety are as destructive to a Nation as
they are to a Church. What can secure a man's
Honesty, or give life to his Industry? What
can cure all those Diseases under which we lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish,
but the possessing mens minds with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
principles of Religion, which will make
them to become a Law and a Rule to themselves?
What can raise in men a generous love to their
Country, which is the root of all Political Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
to so high a degree as the Principles of
Christian Love and Charity, the sense of an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to be given to God for all we do, and
that noblest Principle of all Religion, the raising up
our Natures to become as like the Divine Being
as possibly we can; which will give us a Zeal
of doing all the good we can to Mankind, and
of being publick Blessings to the Age and Place
we live in. These are solid Principles, upon
which Vertue is founded, and in these it finds
a Root, from which it receives a perpetual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.
But if Virtue has no other Root but
Honour, which is a decenter name for Pride or
Humour, there is no strength in this Principle to
resist a Temptation that bears hard upon some
other corrupt Inclination, especially if one hopes
that things may be managed with Art and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65711:10"/>
But on the other hand, what can be desired
to make a Nation great and happy, but that
which at the same time recommends it to the
favour of God? When the Principles of Truth
and Goodness, of Sobriety and Temperance, of
mutual Love and Kindness, and above all, when
an inward strictness in examining ones Actions
as in the sight of God, come to possess multitudes
of Men, then a Nation may reckon it self safe
and happy; because as it comes under a kind and
indulgent Providence; so it has a real strength
from the vertues of every individual Person, in
whom those good qualities live. The World
might be well and happily governed with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
proportion of Understanding, if there were
but a great deal of Vertue under it. For if it
were not for Vice and Falshood, which must be
watched over carefully, there are not such Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in things, but that they may be easily master'd.
Here is then the root of all our evils on the one
hand, and the remedy to them all on the other;
we have fallen from our ancient Vertues, and
our Religion has not force enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
or restrain us; we went easily into corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when great Examples led and encouraged us
to it. But we do not so easily recover out of it,
though we have now as bright Examples before
us the other way; but this has a contrary operation
on depraved Minds, and instead of making them
love Vertue &amp; Religion the better for the lustre with
which it shines in the Persons of those that govern
us, many perhaps love the Government the worse,
because they apprehend that Immorality and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
will become more odious, less excused, and less
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65711:11"/>
protected. But a noble Pattern set by Princes, tho'
it is a great thing in it self, yet it is not all that they
owe to God, and to their People. It does indeed
give them great advantages in reforming their
Courts, and their Subjects, when it appears that
they do not deny to others the freedoms of Vice, that
they may appropriate them to themselves; and
that what they do this way, is not a Hypocritical
affectation for advancing other designs, but that it
is a genuine effect of their own Vertues, a Homage
that they pay to God, and an effect of the Love
that they bear to their People. And we do not doubt
but that every advance that is made in the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Throne of those whom God has set
over us, will be acknowledged by them in such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
of their zeal for God, as we find resolved on
by <hi>David,</hi> That <hi>there eyes shall be upon the faithful
of the land, that they may dwell with them, and that
those who walk in a perfect way shall serve them; but
that froward and wicked persons, those that work de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and tell lyes, shall not stay within their house, nor
so much as in their sight.</hi> For as God will honour
those that honour him, so he likewise expects that
such as he has honoured in the sight of all the World,
by so many repeated marks of his favour, should
honour him not only in their own private deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but likewise in the sight of all their People:
and how natural soever Clemency may be to them,
and how beautiful soever it may appear in them;
yet if milder methods cannot reform us, they must
at last resolve even to cut off wicked Doers from the
City of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Then we may carry our Hopes as far as we can
do our Wishes, when God is of our side, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65711:11"/>
the Seas and Winds, of which he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us many and signal instances, and some of
these very lately, who confounds the Councils
of the wicked, who sometimes takes both their
Understanding and their Hearts from them, and
at other times strikes them with such panick
fears, that one man can chase a thousand of
them; and on the other hand, blesses those that
depend on him, with happy circumstances, so
that the Frame of Nature is of their side, and
from those favourable appearances their Courage
is raised, and their Spirits are animated so, that
nothing can stand in their way. This is often
the Portion of those that <hi>fear God:</hi> For, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all, as there is nothing that depresses and
misguides men more than superstitious and false
Opinions of God and Religion; so there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that does so raise and establish the Mind in
every thing that is great and noble as true Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Religion, which carry a Man to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and best things, of which his nature and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are capable.</p>
            <p>And thus from a great variety of Considerations
it is plain, that the favour of God is the foundation
both of the Security &amp; of the Happiness of a Nation.
This then leads me very naturally to the Second
Head, which is, That it is therefore necessary to use
most earnest and fervent Prayers for removing
God's anger, and for the procuring his favour.</p>
            <p>This can be no indifferent thing, and therefore it
is either to be neglected quite, as an empty Dream;
or if there is any truth in it, we ought to use all
possible means to compass it. If the favour of
Princes is pursued with so much Application and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65711:12"/>
Industry, that all methods both good and bad are
made use of for gaining it; if a constant attendance,
and all the arts of pleasing them, how costly or how
abject soever, are taken for securing an Interest in
them, which perhaps will never succeed, or when
gained may prove of small advantage, and may be
quickly lost; what do we make of our Religion, if
we own that we believe all these things to be true,
and yet will be at no pains to procure to our selves
or to our Country an interest in them. Can such
cold Devotions as ours are, that in the greatest part
are only a compliance with Custom, which we
offer up to God without either attention or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
give us a Title to such invaluable Blessings.
We pursue all things with an earnestness of desire,
and a strength of thought proportioned to the value
that we set on them: And if we are cold and slack
only in the matters of Religion, when we over-doe
every thing else, this shews that either we do not
at all believe them, or that we do not at all value
them. I know earnestness in Prayer is one of the
Subjects of the profane mirth of our Scoffers; they
cannot think that God is moved by our earnestness
to depart from his own counsels, and therefore they
think all fervency in Prayer is a vain heating of the
Imagination to no purpose. But though it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that our Importunities do not overcome God,
though Men are sometimes wearied out with them,
and yield to them; yet he commands us to pray
earnestly, and he promises to reward our fervour
in Prayer, for this end, that the impressions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and of our dependance on him, of our impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
without him, and of his goodness and bounty
to us, may go deep in our minds. These are the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65711:12"/>
springs of all Religion and Vertue; and when these
are strong in us, they govern us in all our actions.
In fact it is certain that none are so powerfully and
effectually subdued by the Principles of Religion, as
those who are frequent &amp; earnest in Prayer. God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made this the <hi>condition</hi> of bestowing his favours
on us, not as it has an effect on himself, to soften and
overcome him, but as it has an effect on us to make us
serious and good: from hence it appears how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
a thing it is for us to pray often and fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And in this all good minds may be appealed to,
that set themselves often to seek God by <hi>Fasting</hi> and
Prayer, if they do not find the happy effects of it
upon their minds: That earnest agitation of their
Thoughts, which is raised by fervent Prayer, ends
in an inward calm, ioyned with higher degrees
of confidence of God, and upon it, a good temper of
mind dwells upon them, their minds grow clearer,
and their thought, brighter: Whereas such as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
secret Prayer, come under a flatness and deadness
in the matter of Religion: It has no life within
them, it gives them neither joy nor courage, zeal
nor affection: Nor is there any thing to which the
visible decay of Religion in this age is so much
owing, as to the neglect of secret Prayer; which has
prevailed so universally, that whereas in former
times it would have passed for a strange thing, if a
Man had gone into any business without he had
first said his Prayers, it would now be thought ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
to hear that a Man was retired to his Prayers:
and the using such earnest and tender Expressions
as we find here in this Psalm, would pass for a mark
of an Enthusiast, or an Hypocrite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But let the World
think and say what they will, it is by Prayer that
our Souls ascend up to God, and draw down all
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65711:13"/>
Blessings from him: This is that which removes his
displeasure, and procures his favour; and neither the
abuse of it by Hypocrites, nor the scorn cast upon it
by Atheists, can lessen its value in the sight of God,
nor our obligation to it.</p>
            <p>To encourage us to it, we have the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Nature and Attributes of God: He
is gracious, slow to anger, and ready to forgive:
Judgment is his strange Work; whereas Mercy
and Compassion are natural to him. It is true,
as he is the just and righteous Governour of the
World, he must punish when it is necessary, for
the maintaining the Order that he has established;
but yet <hi>he afflicts not willingly, nor grieves the
children of men:</hi> and therefore we are sure, that
upon our turning to him, our praying earnestly,
and our repenting sincerely, he will turn from the
fierceness of his anger. Of this we are assured,
both from his Nature and Attributes, and also
from his Promises; and if those limited degrees
of Goodness that are in us bring us under a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness
of heart and readiness to forgive such as
seek to us, had they offended us ever so much,
we have much more reason to assure our selves,
that God will <hi>speak Peace to us,</hi> upon our suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
him as we ought to do.</p>
            <p>There is in this Psalm another consideration
that gives us great encouragement in our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to God for pardon, which is, That in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, when his People had provoked him
to deliver them up to Captivity, he had, upon
their repentance, forgiven their Sins, turned away
his Anger, and brought again their Captivity.
And from those instances of his mercy in past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<hi>David</hi> does expect new proofs of it, as we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65711:13"/>
may also do if we take the same method now which
had such effects formerly: The Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
of God are still the same; Repentance and
Prayer have the same effect at all times. <hi>David</hi>
did here encourage himself with the remembrance
of the Deliverance of the People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
when after a long course of oppression, God did
with a mighty Hand and an out-stretched Arm
bring their Fathers out of that Bondage: and
from that time downward, God had often heard
them when they groaned under the yoke of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors,
into whose hands he had deliver'd them
for their sins; but he had also raised up Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
by whose means they were freed from the
yoke they lay under. And from those signal instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God's hearing their Prayers, and being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to them, they had reason to reckon, that the
Severities of his Judgments, which at any time broke
out upon them, were intended only for their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and Correction. The whole Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
contains a Series of History, made up of those
varieties; That People sinned, and were punished;
they repented and were delivered. In conclusion,
their Sins were such, that they were given up as a
prey to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> but after 70 years Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
they were brought back, upon the Prayers and
Intercessions that <hi>Daniel</hi> and other good men put up
to God, according to God's Promises and to the time
limited by the Prophets. Upon the perfecting of
that Deliverance under <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> they began to
relapse into some of their old Sins; but <hi>Ezra</hi> and
<hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who saw well what consequences these
Sins must have, and how they might be prevented,
engaged them to an early and serious repentance, the
good effects of which continued near 300 years:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65711:14"/>
but then they corrupted themselves again, upon
which they were delivered up into the hands of the
Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi> who oppressed them severely, and
studied to defile their Temple, and to extirpate their
Religion: Upon this they returned to God, and he
raised up Deliverers for them, in the persons of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi>
and his Sons the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> in whose courage,
conduct, and success, we see one of the beautifullest
Scenes that is in History. Those Wars did purge
them quite from all that mad inclination that had
been so long among them, to Idolatry; they
flourished and had rest, about an hundred years, till
they corrupted their Morals again, and then they fell
under the mischiefs of Civil Wars, which made way
to their coming first under the Tyranny of <hi>Herod,</hi>
and then under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke; but under all that
oppression they did not as they had done formerly,
<hi>Repent and turn unto God;</hi> and tho' first St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Baptist, afterwards our Saviour himself, and his
Apostles after him, particularly S. <hi>Iames</hi> the Brother
of our Lord ceased not to call on them to <hi>repent,</hi>
and threatned them with a final extirpation if they
did it not; yet this had no effect, except on some
particular persons, the rest hardened themselves in
their Immoral ties and Hypocrisies: <hi>They killed the
Heir, that the Inheritance might be their own,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Parable, and they stoned and slew
the rest; and they being so obstinate in their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency,
that neither the Calamities they lay
under, nor the Messengers sent them from God,
could work on them; the Wrath of God at last
came upon them to the uttermost, and in so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
a manner, that their destruction is by much
the most tragical piece of History.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:65711:14"/>
Let us next observe in short, the History of
the Christian Religion. It is an astonishing
thing to see a Doctrine, that by its Rules car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
Men to the highest degrees of Purity, and
that received so great Authority from all those
Miracles that accompanied the first opening of
it to the World; yet so soon depraved, even in
the Apostles days, by many false Teachers and
false Christians; this were an incredible thing, if
the Epistles of the Apostles themselves were not
full of it. But upon this, God delivered many of
them up to the Fury of the Jews, and to the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
of <hi>Nero;</hi> but upon their Repentance they
were spared in the final destruction of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
and though there were some particular Instances of
Persecution under <hi>Domitian</hi> and <hi>Trajan,</hi> they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
for a Sect of the Jews; yet after that they
had a long Peace of about 140 Years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
In which time the Christian Religion did
shine in the purity of their Lives, who professed
it, and did spread it self over the whole Roman
Empire: And the Instances of Severity that were
acted in a few Places, gave the Church the Glory
of many Martyrs, while the rest were rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by their Constancy, than terrified with
their cruel Deaths. The Writers of those Times
do often make their Appeals to the Lives of the
Christians, to prove the purity of their Doctrine:
Yet Numbers are generally bad, and a long Peace
brings naturally with it, a softness on Mens Minds,
together with a dissolution of their Morals; of
which S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> gives us a particular account, in
terms that shew he did not flatter his Side, nor the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65711:15"/>
Order of the Church, to which he was so great
an Honour; for he sets out the Corruptions, as
well of the Bishops and Clergy, as of the Laity of
his Time, in a stile that is far from Partiality.
After this came Persecution after Persecution; but
these having the Effect for which they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of God, the Church had again forty
Years Peace. But it would offend weak Minds,
to hear the words in which <hi>Eusebius</hi> sets forth the
Corruption that this brought on the Church:
Then came the last Persecution, which continued
Ten Years with very little intermission, and
with so excessive a Fury, that in the succession of
the Persecutors, every one studied to out-do all
that had gone before him. Yet these repeated
Fires of their Martyrs, kindling another Fire in
the Minds of the Christians, and setting them on
to Fastings and Prayers, God did at last arise,
and sent them a Deliverer, from this Island, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
who first gave them Quiet and Liberty,
and then Protection and Favour, and then the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion shined with a new Lustre of Wealth
and Prosperity: But, alas, this was not so happy
to it as that which the Fires of the Martyrs had
given it. The Church did soon degenerate, and
the Bishops of the chief Sees fell into Factions.
The History of that Time gives us but a sad viow
of the governing Men of the Church. But yet
even there we have a Witness in favour of that
Religion that is beyond Exception, I mean <hi>Iulian,</hi>
who tells his Heathen Priests, in his Zeal for the
restoring of Paganism, how both Priests and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ought to imitate the Lives, the Temperance,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65711:15"/>
the Gravity, and above all, the Charity that was
among the Christians. But insensibly in the
course of an Age, Christianity did so degenerate,
that scarce any thing of the first Purity and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
was left. Great Disorders, Irreconcileable
Heats, and Differences, and Disputes, even about
Authority and precedence, tore the Church, and
exposed it to the Reproaches of its Enemies: And
after that God had suffered that Apostacy for a
whole Age, it drew at last a Series of Plagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, that amazes every one that reads it.
The Western Empire was over-run with an Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Northern Nations, that came so thick
one after another, that whatsoever one had spared,
seem to be only reserved to be destroyed by the
next that came. In a word, the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals,</hi>
and the <hi>Hunns</hi> brought an unheard-of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
along with them; that was followed
by Plagues and Famines, to so high a degree, that
whole Countries were almost dispeopled. The
Eastern Empire was also long wasted by the <hi>Goths</hi>
and <hi>Avares,</hi> and then by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and finally
destroyed by the <hi>Turks.</hi> In this Island we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Christian Religion very early: We had
our Martyrs as well as the other Churches, and a
particular simplicity of Manners, which is remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
as the peculiar Ornament of our Clergy: But
this did not last long, for there followed a vast
Corruption among all sorts of People, which is
set forth very sincerely and pathetically, by a very
good Man that saw it, and lamented it, I mean <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das;</hi>
after that we lost both our Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and fell under the Saxon Tyranny, than Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65711:16"/>
got footing again among us, within an
Age and an half after that, but it was much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed
and debased; yet, such as it was, it made a
great progress, and produced some very good Men,
if we may believe <hi>Bede.</hi> But the Nation became
rather more corrupt than ever, and then we were
delivered over to the Depredations, the Burnings
and Cruelty of the <hi>Danes,</hi> which continued at
several Reprises, for near two hundred Years to
be the Plague of <hi>England.</hi> At last all was melted
into one Government, but then the Nation became
a Scene of Blood, what during the Competitions to
the Crown, the Barons Wars, the Wars with <hi>France,</hi>
and those of the Houses of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to take a narrower view of the State of the
Protestant Religion, both abroad in the World,
and here in <hi>England,</hi> we shall find how often God,
for the Sins of those who carried that worthy
Name of <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> but that were not
worthy of it, has brought them very low; and what
sudden and unlook'd-for Deliverances have again
recover'd and restored them. Upon the first open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Reformation, all the World run into it.
The Corruptions and Ignorance of Popery, were
things of which all Men were so weary, that they
with joy welcomed the Light and the Purity of the
Gospel: but in the multitudes that embraced it,
there was a great mixture; many came in only for
the Spoil, and threw off the Yoke of all Religion,
as well as that of Popery. But God punished this
severely; for though they were by much the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
force in <hi>Germany,</hi> which was then the Scene;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65711:16"/>
and were secretly favoured both by <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> yet all their Strength did melt away, and
they dividing their Forces, became an easy Prey to
<hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th,</hi> who got both their Heads, the
<hi>Elector of Sax,</hi> and the <hi>Landgrave of Hesse</hi> into
his Power, and made all the rest bend under him;
only the Town of <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> stood out against
him: And in a course of five Years Success, the
Protestant Interest was brought so low, that it
was every where given for lost, when of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<hi>Maurice of Saxe,</hi> that had been the chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of dividing the Party, and of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it up to the Emperor, gave Matters so quick
a turn, that the Emperor was forced to run out
of <hi>Germany;</hi> and he soon saw he could not hope
ever to return to it, without granting the Edict
of <hi>Passaw,</hi> under which Security the Protestant
Religion has subsisted there ever since.</p>
            <p>Not many years after that a second Storm arose,
King <hi>Edward</hi> died, and while Queen <hi>Mary</hi> persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and burnt the Protestants here in <hi>England,
France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> fell under the Ministry of two
Cardinals, who seeing that the way which they
called <hi>Heresy,</hi> was gaining ground every-where,
under the shelter of the Wars, they projected and
effected a Peace, in order to the Extirpating of
<hi>Heresy;</hi> but while this was in agitation, Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> died: and soon after, the King of <hi>France</hi> was
killed, and left that Kingdom under the feebleness
of a long Minority: a Deliverance sprung up also
in <hi>Holland,</hi> after many unsuccessful Attempts, by a
small company of Fishermen, who seized on the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65711:17"/>
               <hi>Brill,</hi> and from inconsiderable beginnings, falling
happily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under the Conduct of a Family of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,
have grown up to be one of the Powerfullest
Nations that any Age has seen: Here was the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Crisis carried off.</p>
            <p>A Third was, when the League of <hi>France</hi> was
formed, for the Extirpation of <hi>Protestants,</hi> and that
<hi>Spain</hi> at the same time designed the Conquest of
<hi>England,</hi> upon which they reckon'd, that the War
in the Low-Countries would soon come to an end:
but all this was blasted, the <hi>Armada</hi> of Eighty eight
was scattered and lost, the Heads of the League were
killed, and <hi>Spain</hi> became so feeble, that those were
its last efforts. In this Age, from the Year 1620,
for ten Years together, the whole <hi>Protestant</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
was every-where sinking. The Revolution
of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the Reduction of <hi>Hungary,</hi> raised the
House of <hi>Austria</hi> so high, that every thing that stood
in their way, fell before them; and all the Attempts
made to preserve <hi>Germany,</hi> proved fatal to those who
undertook it; then <hi>Holland</hi> was brought very low,
by the loss of <hi>Breda,</hi> and the breach among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
occasioned by the <hi>Arminian</hi> business; the
<hi>French</hi> Protestants were by the Reduction of <hi>Rochel,</hi>
brought to extremities; <hi>England</hi> fell under a feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and dis-joynting at home, when of a sudden, the
Great <hi>Gustavus</hi> with a small Army broke through
the whole <hi>Austrian</hi> Force, and restored the Liberty
of <hi>Germany,</hi> and obliged <hi>France</hi> that needed his
Alliance to confirm the Edicts in favour of the
Protestants; so that Storm went over, and the
Protestant Religion was again as strong as ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65711:17"/>
The next Crisis was in Seventy Two, when
the <hi>States</hi> were marked out, to be the First Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;
but we were to have gone next, and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
and Popery were every-where to be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished:
That Union which had at first such
an unlook'd-for success, had almost swallowed
up <hi>Holland,</hi> the Inundation breaking in upon
them with such a Rapidity, that nothing could
stand before it, till a Young Prince, who as he
was the Inheritor of the Glory of Four Successive
Ancestors, every one of whom had Lustre enough
to have ennobled a whole Race; so was he design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Heaven, for a much greater Harvest of
Triumph and Glory; till he, I say, stemmed this
Torrent by so small a handful at first, that it
seemed a tempting of Providence, to have hoped
for success, where the Force was so unequal. But
his Vertues, and his Valour begot, first Union at
home, and then Security abroad; and tho' he
could not all at once raise up their Armies to
imitate the Pattern he set them; yet, we now
see, even in their late misfortune, with what a
Spirit of Courage such a <hi>Hero</hi> can inspire an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
This Crisis went off likewise, and there
appeared such Characters of the Protection of God
over <hi>the Man, whom he had made strong for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;</hi>
and the State which was then so gloriously
preserved, that all the World looked on this, as an
Essay of the Great things that Heaven design'd
to the Age, by that Hand, whose first Attempts
proved so fortunate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:65711:18"/>
The last Crisis in which we still are, began in
85, when within the compass of one Year, Popery
was on the Throne here in <hi>England;</hi> it had likewise
the <hi>Palatinate</hi> brought under it, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion was proscribed and Persecuted,
both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy.</hi> Then the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Pride and Cruelty of the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor,
reckoned that Heresy was to be extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all the World over: There was indeed no
visible Hope left, but in him who had begun his
Carier with so much Glory, and seemed marked out
to be the Common Deliverer of <hi>Europe,</hi> as well as
the special Blessing of all the Churches of God.
I shall not enlarge further on that, with the
Sense of which I hope all your Hearts are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
how ungratefully soever it may be opposed
by some, whose Designs, whatever their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may be, tend to the bringing us under <hi>French</hi>
Tyranny, and Popish Cruelty. When we also
consider the special Deliverances of this Church,
the Critical Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Rome;</hi> and of Q. <hi>Mary's</hi> Death. Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Glorious Reign; the discovery of
the Gunpowder-Treason; the long Peace of
Eighty Years with which this Kingdom was
blessed, to which there is not any thing that
can be compared in our whole History; the
easy conclusion of a long and bloody Civil
War; the First, and now the Second Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> with the surprising Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of both: What reason have we from
all these to conclude, that as God has hitherto
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65711:18"/>
watched over us, and preserved us in so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
a manner, he will still continue to do it?
But this last Deliverance of <hi>Ireland</hi> must not be
past over in general Words. Can we reflect on
the many Dangers to which that <hi>Sacred Life,</hi>
on which all ours depend, in so signal a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
was so lately exposed, without feeling a
Commotion within us, that is both melting and
tender? for though it is now past, we still
tremble to think that it was once so near; while
a Hand of Heaven seemed so to lead the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,
that though it was suffered to <hi>touch his
Anointed, yet could do him no Harm.</hi> Do not
we look amazed on one another, when we think
in what a State we had been, if it had gone
deeper; while he that received it, seemed to be
the least concerned of all that beheld it. And
thus while other Princes take care of their own
Safety, and grow proud upon the Glory that
their Subjects procure them; He does not think
the Regal Dignity bright enough, but as it
takes a fresh Lustre from Military Glory. But
while we take leave humbly to complain, that
he has so little regard to himself, we must with
all Thankfulness acknowledg, that this defect of
Care in him is fully supplied by the watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of that Providence, on which he does in
so particular a manner depend; If our Glory has
on another side received an Eclipse, tho even on
those less fortunate Occasions we have seen parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Instances of a watchful Providence, while
the Winds changed to preserve and favour us;
and perhaps it would have been too great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65711:19"/>
to Pride and Security, if we should
have had two great Victories at once. Yet if
we have failed at this time, What may not we
hope from such an Essay, but that Angels watch
over him, and that the Head of Angels covers
him? and that this retarding of our Deliverance,
and darkning of our Glory, is but for a new
reserve of Triumph to him, whose Scene of
Success is not compleat, till all that false shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
which has so long compared it self to
the Sun, is darkned; and that not only <hi>England,</hi>
but <hi>Europe,</hi> is by his Means delivered from all
their Fears and Dangers.</p>
            <p>But how far soever such a Subject may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
me, I must not suffer you to forget that
which remains of my Text, <hi>But let them not
turn again to Folly.</hi> I shall not dwell here
upon so beaten a Path, as the shewing you
the Madness and Follies of Vice. You have so
many Instances of so great force round about
you to demonstrate this, that it is needless
to enlarge upon the Breaches that Vice makes
on Mens Persons, and their Estates, on their
Reputation and Courage; its wasting their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and depressing their Minds, are such visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things, and have shewed us so many Wrecks
on all hands, that we must needs see how just
and reasonable it is to bring all these Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
under the denomination of Folly. Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is also such a debasing the Nature, both
of God and of Man, by which the Idea's of
God are brought so low, and our Natures are
so affronted, while we prostrate our selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65711:19"/>
the Works of Mens Hands, or the Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Minds, that this is also <hi>Folly,</hi> and
a <hi>Folly</hi> of so strange a kind, that it is not easy
to imagine that Humane Nature should be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of it: But no <hi>Folly</hi> is more extravagant
than that of imagining that things were made,
and are preserved by Chance, or Fate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the directions of a wise and good Being:
And that either there is no God, nor Maker
of all Things; or if there is one, that he has
abandoned the Works of his Hands, that he does
not see through the thick Cloud, that it is in
vain to serve him, and that his Wrath is but
a Word, made use of by crafty Men to frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Fools. This is the Language of Scoffers,
and a degree of <hi>Folly</hi> beyond all others, even
the venturing upon Eternal Misery, upon the
maddest set of Principles that ever were put
together. These are the Follies that we must
guard against, lest if after God has delivered
us once more, we should again relapse into
them, and that then our latter End should prove
worse than the Beginning.</p>
            <p>If God should now according to the Riches of
his Grace deliver us from all our Enemies, and from
the hand of all that hate us, and should establish
that which he has wrought for us, and add to the
Settlement of his true Religion, and the happy
Constitution both of Church and State among us,
a secure and honourable Peace, a fullness of Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and a freedom of Trade, and should carry the
Glory of our Soveraigns so high, as to make them
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65711:20"/>
the Arbiters of Christendom, and the Protectors
of all Protestants. If I say, after so great an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Wealth and Prosperity, of Success and
Glory to us, we should then give our selves up
to our Vices, as if all our Blessings were only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to furnish out our Luxury with all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Entertainments; if we should grow proud
of the Ancient Valour of our Nation, while we
degenerate from it our selves; and by despising
our Neighbours, should both make them stronger,
and our selves weaker; if we should take up our
Animosities, as if we had only made a Truce with
one another, while we had a mighty Enemy to deal
with, and so would revive these Follies, which God
has by an Interposition of so many Providences called
on us to forget; if we of the Church should forget all
our promises, and resolve to yield nothing for the
gaining of our Brethren, but should let our Minds ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be soured with the old Leaven of bitterness and
malice. If those who depart from us, should rather
study to strengthen their Party, than to hearken to
the Counsels of Peace; if those of a higher Rank,
should become swell'd with Pride, or softned with
Voluptuousness; If the Clergy should become La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy,
Covetous, and Ambitious; and the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
should again break loose into open Vice, and
divide into Parties and Factions: But above all, if
Impiety and Blasphemy, Scoffing and Atheism,
should again be in vogue, and pass for Wit and
Spirit, then upon so fatal an abuse of God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
we should have reason to look for Judgments
as eminent, as such our Ingratitude should be;
and that the return of Wrath should be so heavy,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65711:20"/>
that our Portion should be to perish with an
everlasting Destruction from the Presence of the
Lord, and from the Glory of his Power. But if
we become so wise, and so good as to improve the
Deliverance that is already come to us, and those
which we have in prospect, to the Noble ends for
which they are design'd by God, then we may
expect to see an accomplishment of all the other
Blessings which <hi>David</hi> promises to himself, and
to his people in this Psalm, That <hi>Mercy and Truth
should meet together, and Righteousness and Peace
should kiss each other.</hi> That a Spirit of Truth,
and Honesty, and Love, and Charity, should run
through the whole Nation, and knit it altogether
in one Body; that <hi>Truth</hi> should become so natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to them, that like the growth of the Earth,
it should <hi>spring up</hi> of it self; and that <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
should like a dew from Heaven, cover the
whole Land; that God should bless them with
every good thing, and that they should have a
rich Soil and fruitful Seasons; and that Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
should be near or present at every return
of Danger, for preserving those that fear God;
and the top of all, that <hi>Glory</hi> should dwell in
their Land: By which is to be understood that
Cloud of Glory which was between the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,
and was the Symbol of God's Presence
among them; that is, That the True Religion,
with all the happy Characters of God's Favour,
should be still continued among them, by which
they were the Glory of all Lands, and all the
Nations of the Earth were to be blest in them:
This as applied to us, is, that God may establish
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65711:21"/>
and continue his True Religion among us, that
he may watch over, and preserve those whom he
has set over us; and that as their Lives have
been hitherto a Series of Wonders, so he may
perfect that which concerns them, and bless the
Work of their Hands; and that the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
may return to its Ancient Honesty and
Vertue; and that all Differences and Divisions
may be composed, we being animated with one
Heart, and one Spirit; and that to all this, the
Blessings of Peace and Plenty may be joined:
which God of his Infinite Mercy grant, through
Jesus Christ our Lord, <hi>Amen.</hi>
