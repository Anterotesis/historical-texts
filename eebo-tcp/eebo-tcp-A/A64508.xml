            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Truly Sir, I had drest up the <hi>Mormo</hi> of the
<hi>Popish Plot,</hi> with so much popular and artificial
horror, that I had almost frighted the people out

When I observed a fit juncture to put the Nation
into a flame, I first kindled the fire with those
Brimstone Matches, the <hi>fears,</hi> and <hi>Jealousies</hi> of
<hi>Popery,</hi> I had then the mighty advantage of a <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
House of Commons,</hi> who were at that time
the <hi>Representative Lungs</hi> of the <hi>Nation:</hi> Their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
breath blew up the flame into so fierce a rage,
that the City was cooler in the fire of <hi>London,</hi> than
it was in the heat of the <hi>Popish Plot;</hi> and when I
had procured a <hi>Printed Resolve,</hi> and prefixed it
to a <hi>Fast-book,</hi> that there was a <hi>Damnable hellish
Popish Plot</hi> against the Life of the King, and
the Government, I thought I had been secure both
of the Government and the Life of the King: But,
oh, that fatal flight from <hi>Oxford!</hi> It was ten times
more unfortunate to us than the Kings escape from
<hi>Worcester;</hi> for then he only fled with his own Life,
and left us to share his Fortunes, but now he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his Crowns and Kingdoms with him; and
left us nothing but Prisons, and Pillories, Jayles,

the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> would have done in the Ashes of

the Ruine, and dissembled the affront to my Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

think it my Interest to disown it.</p>

your <hi>Smithfield Fires,</hi> and your <hi>Gunpowder

               <p>Well, I do hope that <hi>Time</hi> or the <hi>Gallows</hi>
will give you Grace to confess the <hi>Cheat;</hi> in the
mean time, I must tell you, that if you had charged
me with a <hi>Plot</hi> of any Honourable contrivance, or
plausible Perjury, I should have pardoned such a
meritorious forgery; but to bring me upon the
Stage in a Fools-coat and Cap, to make my Nobles,
and Priests, to act the parts of <hi>Bedlams,</hi> this was a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53578:6"/>
                  <hi>Sham,</hi> and <hi>Effrontery,</hi> that must be <hi>resented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You know that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been
more famous for Policy, than Divinity, and I
have, by <hi>finess,</hi> and <hi>artifice,</hi> ruined more Kings
than ever you knew; and can it be reconciled to
common Reason, or Interest, that we should trust
the <hi>Arcana</hi> of our <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and those Sacred
endearments of Lives and Fortunes, to the Mercy
and Management of a Company of <hi>Banditi, Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadoes,</hi>
and <hi>Lazarillo's,</hi> whose Iniquity and Indigence
must certainly betray us?</p>
               <p>Had you told the people, that there was a mighty
<hi>Spanish Armada</hi> seen at Anchor on <hi>Salisbury Plaines,</hi>
it had been as probable a <hi>Romance,</hi> as your <hi>Forty
Thousand Pilgrims</hi> from <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the Murder of Sir <hi>E.B.G.</hi> It fell out
unluckily, the laying of the <hi>Scene</hi> in <hi>Somerset-house,</hi>
for it looks a little odly, that the <hi>Thames</hi> gliding by
the walls of that Palace, the Murderers of that
unfortunate Gentleman should not in that Critical
juncture have endeavoured an eternal concealment
of the Murder, especially there being at hand, so
easie and so safe a conveyance to the <hi>Thames,</hi> where
with less weight than a Milstone, he might have
been sunk 'till <hi>Dooms-day;</hi> but the overseeing this
ready advantage, and the exposing his Body above
ground, nigh the passage to an <hi>Imperial City,</hi> look'd like
Frenzy beyond all the extravagancies and costacies
of <hi>Bedlam;</hi> you might as well have reported that
I had cut my own Throat, or leapt off the <hi>Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
And it is a miracle to me, how you could
gain a belief of so wonderful a Proceeding.</p>

               <p>Why, Sir, the very word <hi>Pope,</hi> is Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and hath a prodigious power of Infatuation
upon the people of <hi>England:</hi> For suppose I should
<hi>Invent</hi> a <hi>Plot,</hi> as dark, and confused, as the first
<hi>Chaos,</hi> whose Monstrosities could out-do all the
Fables of <hi>Talmud</hi> and <hi>Alcoran:</hi> Allow me but the
<hi>Harangues</hi> of a <hi>Presbyterian One-and-Forty-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
to Eccho the noise of a <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> and the
<hi>People</hi> would believe it as great a <hi>Truth,</hi> as the
<hi>Pharisees Conspiracy</hi> against <hi>Jesus;</hi> but to conclude
this; Sir, I spoke the <hi>Prologue</hi> to the <hi>Popish Plot</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Westminster:</hi> And at <hi>Oxford,</hi>
the <hi>King</hi> unhappily spoke the <hi>Epilogue;</hi> and so
<hi>FINIS</hi> and <hi>FITS-HARRIS.</hi>

               <p>But Brother, you know that the <hi>Good Old
Cause,</hi> which is our Common Interest, amounts
to no less than a <hi>Supremacy</hi> over all the <hi>Kings</hi> of
the Earth; and that is so Sweet, and Glorious a
<hi>Sovereignty,</hi> that I hope you will never give over
your designs for <hi>That fift Monarchy,</hi> or Kingdom of
<hi>Christ,</hi> as you wisely phrase it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Never suspect it, my zeal is too warm and
obstinate, to be discouraged by a <hi>Disappointment;</hi>
and as long as my <hi>Numbers</hi> can merit the name of
<hi>Legion,</hi> or <hi>Association,</hi> so long I will have the grace
to persevere; and therefore having shed a little
blood by a falsifying blow, but missing my chief
aim in the <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> I still pursued the same
design, only shifting the Scene from <hi>Rome,</hi> to
<hi>Geneva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now enter <hi>Anthony</hi> and the <hi>Giant Ferguson,</hi>

by a mighty train, tyed together with <hi>Green

have diversity of Gifts, and difference in <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
My <hi>Presbyterian</hi> was for destroying the
<hi>King</hi> after the <hi>English</hi> fashion, by the more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and Religious procedure of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> or
the <hi>Popular Authority</hi> of a <hi>High Court of Justice:</hi>
My <hi>Independent <hi>Zelots</hi>
                  </hi> were for <hi>Killing the King,
Alamode de France;</hi> and like your St. <hi>Clement,</hi> and
<hi>Raviliac,</hi> resolved upon the surest, and shortest
method of <hi>Assassination; <hi>Your</hi> Jesuit Mariana</hi> and
<hi>My <hi>Junius Brutus</hi>
                  </hi> have resolved the Case, that if
<hi>a Prince invades our Religious Rights or Civil Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,</hi>
he is, by <hi>your</hi> Divinity, and <hi>Mine,</hi> decreed
a <hi>Tyrant:</hi> And then we are agreed on both sides,
that a <hi>Tyrant</hi> is a <hi>State-Behemoth,</hi> and <hi>to kill such a
Beast of Prey, is not only Justice, but Merit:</hi> What
<hi>Sainted</hi> our <hi>George,</hi> but the <hi>killing</hi> of a <hi>Dragon?</hi> and when <hi>David</hi> slew the <hi>Lion,</hi> and the <hi>Bear,</hi> and cut
off the head of the <hi>Uncircumcised Philistine,</hi> he was
a <hi>Hero</hi> but no <hi>Assassin.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>I grant that if a Prince affront our humour
or Interest, we have an ancient privilege to censure
him for an <hi>Her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tick</hi> or a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> But in this Age,
I dare not own the Consequence of <hi>Assassination;</hi>
not that this Modesty proceeds from any nicety of
<hi>Conscience,</hi> but <hi>Policy,</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> oblige me to
dissemble that <hi>Grim Divinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whatever you pretend, I know the Duke
hath a greater Endearment for his <hi>Brother,</hi> than
he hath for the <hi>Pope,</hi> and I do easily foresee, that
if the <hi>King</hi> should fall by the hand of a <hi>Papist,</hi>
the <hi>Duke</hi> would, in abhorrence of the Fact, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53578:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
himself a <hi>Protestant,</hi> nothing would appease
his revenging mind, but a <hi>Massacre</hi> of the <hi>Papists</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>Ashes</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed if I were again <hi>Lord Paramount</hi> of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and had <hi>Crowns</hi> for <hi>Styrrups;</hi> and could mount
my horse upon the back of <hi>Kings,</hi> as formerly I
have done: Or if <hi>my <hi>Numbers</hi>
                  </hi> in <hi>England</hi> were as
great as <hi>yours,</hi> I should then no more scruple the
hard words of <hi>Association,</hi> or <hi>Assassination,</hi>
than you do; but in my present Circumstances, I
can only dance in a <hi>Court-Mask,</hi> with <hi>Caress,</hi> and

               <p>Nay, I am satisfied, that your present tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

as long as you are <hi>Pope,</hi> you must be of my opinion,
in the matter of <hi>Princes;</hi> and so long I will own
you for a <hi>Brother:</hi> But if ever you dwindle into a

Thesis,<note place="margin">Tyrannum posse &amp; debere occidi à quocun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que subdito non aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta vi modo sed etiam per insidias &amp; fraudes.</note> 
                  <hi>that</hi> any Subject whatsoever,
<hi>not only</hi> might, <hi>but</hi> was obliged to
destroy a Tyrant, either by open vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,

               <p>
                  <hi>This Decree was occasion'd by the Impudence
of your Rebel Ancestors, the</hi> True Protestant Hussites
<hi>of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>who declared it as an Article of their
reforming Divinity, that</hi> if a Prince were a Criminal,
he did by his crimes forfeit his Crown, and any one
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53578:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might with impunity despoil
him of that Authority,<note place="margin">Principes quocunque crimine admisso principatu cadere posse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que potestate quam injuria occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pabant à quocunque impune Spoliari.</note> to
which <hi>(in their opinion)</hi> he
had then no Title.</p>
               <p>Now you must know that the Golden Trade of
disposing Crowns and Kingdoms was the Monopoly
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and I only claim the Prerogative of
<hi>Religions Regicide;</hi> and therefore when your
<hi>Hussites</hi> and <hi>Taborites</hi> became <hi>Interlopers,</hi> it was
my Interest to decree, <hi>that none should destroy Kings
but my self.</hi> But, to speak truth to a Brother,
there was at that time <hi>Three Heads,</hi> that did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the <hi>Triple</hi> Crown; and the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> being under that distraction, might pass
that <hi>Canon</hi> as a Complement to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> who
had the chief influence and management of <hi>That
Council;</hi> but I cannot find that Pope <hi>Martin the fifth,</hi>
or <hi>Eugenius,</hi> or any of their <hi>Roman Successors,</hi> did
ever Ratify that <hi>Anathema,</hi> and therefore, it having
no <hi>Pontifical</hi> sanction, I have left my self as much
power and freedom to destroy and depose Kings,
as ever I had <hi>before</hi> the Council of <hi>Constance;</hi> and if
ever the Stars be again <hi>Popishly-affected,</hi> you shall
see me reassume my Thunders with a <hi>Non obstante.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I grant that we must assert the <hi>Papal, and Popular Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi>
by maintaining our <hi>deposing,</hi> and <hi>Assassinating
Divinity;</hi> for this will be a mighty awe upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and without this, we can never propagate our
<hi>Good Old Cause;</hi> but the Cavaliering Clergy of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> have cursed arguments against
this our Common Principle, and in my opinion,
my Jesuit <hi>Mariana</hi> has not answer'd them with
sufficient satisfaction, and I would gladly hear how
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53578:8"/>
your Sophistry can respond to those desperate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections;
but at this time I will only mention their
Argument drawn from Antiquity: They tell us
that the Christians of the <hi>first three hundred years,</hi>
had a greater advantage of understanding the Laws
and Temper of <hi>Christianity,</hi> than we can pretend
to, at the distance of <hi>sixteen Centuries;</hi> and though
these Christians lived under Emperours, who were
<hi>Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Tyrants</hi> too; yet they quietly suffer'd
all the Invasions upon their Lives, Liberties, and
Properties, that a Tyrannick malice and power
could contrive or execute, and yet in the History of
those Ages, we Read of the <hi>Noble Army of
Martyrs,</hi> but not of <hi>One Rebel, or Assassin</hi>
among all the <hi>Christian Legions.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Do you account this such a formidable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Yes indeed in my opinion it looks severely,
and if you can take it off, you deserve to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
to the whole order of <hi>Jesuits.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, First I answer, that it is very
probable, it was a Christian Souldier that Murdered
<hi>Julian</hi> in his <hi>Persian</hi> expedition, and that Souldier
was the only <hi>True-Protestant</hi> or <hi>Papist</hi> in all the
<hi>Roman Army.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if a meer probability have not weight e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
then I grant them the opinion of some of
their admired ancients, that <hi>Julian</hi> was slain by an
<hi>Angel;</hi> now it cannot be fancied, that an <hi>Evil
Angel</hi> should smite an <hi>Apostate Brother,</hi> for it could
not be the <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> to destroy such an
eminent <hi>Devoto</hi> to <hi>his Empire:</hi> And if he were
dispatch't by <hi>Gabriel,</hi> or <hi>Michael,</hi> or any other of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53578:9"/>
the Heavenly Host, then we have a precedent from
<hi>Heaven,</hi> for the killing of <hi>Tyrants</hi> upon <hi>Earth;</hi>
and why should not the <hi>Saints</hi> be <hi>Assassins,</hi> as well
as <hi>Angels;</hi> especially considering that those flaming
Spirits are made the patern of our Zeal and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>This I confess may be plausible to the <hi>Vulgus,</hi>
but the Malignant Divines will unluckily rejoyn, that
Angels were no Subjects of the Empire; under
no obligation of Allegiance to the Emperour <hi>Julian,</hi>
and that the destroying Angel had a divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or a special warrant for that execution: But
they will tell the world, that every humane Soul
is obliged to be Subject to the Secular powers, and
therefore conclude, that the Assassination of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants
must be left as the peculiar service of <hi>Angels,</hi>
but 'tis beyond the Commission of <hi>Saints.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Well then, Grant that <hi>Julian</hi> fell by a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
dart, and that there is not one instance of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,</hi>
or <hi>Regicide</hi> in the <hi>first three hundred years,</hi>
what is all this to you and I? For I return them
their own argument in the Case of <hi>Cathedrals,</hi> and
<hi>Ceremonies;</hi> what tho' the Church in her Infant
weakness knew no such Glorious or Solemn practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
must they therefore be unlawful to the <hi>Saints,</hi>
who are arrived to the full heat of blood, and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very?
They might argue by the same Logick, that
because Innocent <hi>Adam</hi> went naked, therefore no
<hi>Saint</hi> must wear a <hi>Coat of Maile;</hi> and because <hi>Abel</hi>
knew nothing of the Invention of <hi>Guns,</hi> therefore
it is unlawful for the race of <hi>Cain</hi> to fire a <hi>Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbus.</hi>

               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>I acknowledge this answer to be fine and
popular, but it will never silence the Clergy of
<hi>England,</hi> those disputers of this world.</p>

               <p>Sir, if you and I can compose such a <hi>System</hi>
of <hi>Politick Divinity,</hi> as to perswade the People,
that the <hi>Saints,</hi> and the <hi>Senate,</hi> have the Supreme
disposing of <hi>Princes,</hi> our business is done by that
popular delusion, and we may laugh at all the
Learning and Arguments of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford.</hi>
For we have this advantage, that our <hi>Proselytes</hi> will
sooner Read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> than the Writings of the
<hi>English Clergy,</hi> and have no more value for <hi>Their
Canons,</hi> than they have for the Votes of a House of
<hi>Commons.</hi> But as for the <hi>Tory Divines,</hi> it is as much
impossible for us to convince them, as it is for them
to convert us, for they are such blind adorers of
the King, that they honour him even to Idolatry,
and wish his Kingdom might be everlasting.</p>
               <p>I dare ingage they should sooner believe the
Miracle of the <hi>Masse,</hi> than the momentous mystery
of <hi>Assassination;</hi> and might with more ease be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>Alas, Sir, these were excellent Words in
Popular Cant and delusion, and therefore I used
them to serve my Interest; but I never thought
them more Divine or Almighty, than the Name

made as great a noise, and did as much service, as

for the <hi>Turkish</hi> Army, for that was too broad a
discovery of Irreligion; sure you cannot think that
the <hi>Grand Vizir</hi> did fight the <hi>Lords Battels;</hi> but
yet I suppose, that you are of the opinion of your
great Apostle, <hi>Luther,</hi> for I remember that <hi>Sultan
Solyman</hi> and <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> did infest the <hi>German
Empire</hi> in the same Age; and <hi>Martin</hi> had so great
a Friendship for <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that he and his followers
taught the people in publick Harangues, <hi>that it was
a mortal Sin to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the</hi> Turks,<note place="margin">Luthero y sus sequaces, predicavan, y hazian entender, a la probre gente Tudesca que pelear contra Turcos era peccado mortal, tanto como restir sia la voluntad de Dios, que los embiava para castigar al Papa, y a los Principes Christianos que eran catorze vezes peores que Turcos.

this is base, Unpolitick and Treacherous; but the

there was so much honourable Evidence against me,
that if I had <hi>denied</hi> the whole matter, I must have

the whole Plot, I must have been Branded for a

to make such cloudy confessions, and mystical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials,
that the <hi>Tories</hi> thought there was enough

valued at such a Rate, that we are plagued with
Addresses from all Quarters; and such Addresses
too, as tend more to make him a <hi>Sultan,</hi> than a

there was no room for the <hi>Imperial Army,</hi> or the

divino,</hi> than you and I.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding your droll upon the Throng
of Addressers, yet I look upon that proceeding as
a very Politick Stratagem; for they have rendred
the King Great and Formidable, and have firmly
establisht that Church, which you and I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to destroy; you may remember that your
flourishing Address to <hi>Oliver,</hi> in LIII. did help to
make him as great as the <hi>Mogul,</hi> for those Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Strains and Titles awed the people into as
great an opinion of <hi>Cromwell,</hi> as if he had been
Brother to the Sun, Kinsman to the Moon, and
Cozen German to the Stars; and therefore sure this
publick artifice of <hi>Popular Addresses</hi> must have as
Glorious an effect upon a lawful Prince, as it had
in the Case of an <hi>Usurper;</hi> for I am afraid the King
hath Listed more men by the <hi>Rolls</hi> of <hi>Addresses,</hi>
than ever you did by the <hi>Musters</hi> of <hi>Petitions.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>Give me, once more but a Rampant and
Sitting-house of <hi>Commons,</hi> and I will not value all
the ranting Addresses of <hi>England,</hi> for many of those
men, who now adore the <hi>King,</hi> as the <hi>Pagans</hi> did
their <hi>Jupiter,</hi> would then Worship our God <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius,</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53578:15"/>
and fall down before the chief Speaker of
the People.</p>
               <p>I know several in the List of Addressers, who
inserted their names in a meer Trimming compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to <hi>Tantivy</hi> Times; but if ever occasion serves,
will with more chearfulness subscribe a Petition
for a Parliament, than ever they did an Address
to the King.</p>
               <p>And besides, there are many of these promising
Addressers, who are men of so little and narrow
Souls, that they value their Blood, and their
Gold, at the same rate; and would not part with
three Drops of the one, nor three Scruples of the
other, to save the King and his Three Crowns;
and what an empty Complement is the promise
of <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes,</hi> from <hi>Cowards,</hi> and <hi>Misers!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I will grant, that there are vast numbers of
Addressers, who are men of Resolution, and such
Simplicity of Conscience as to think themselves
obliged by their promise, to Sacrifice both Men
and Money in defence of the King; but suppose
we had dispatched the King and the Duke at the
<hi>Rye,</hi> and there had been no right Heir to the Crown,
within the compass of the <hi>four Seas;</hi> then all the
Addresses would have been Impertinent extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies,
for you know that he, who destroys the
King, dissolves the whole <hi>Militia;</hi> and in this Case,
the Addressers would have demurred upon Puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio's
of Law, and would not have dared to beat a
<hi>Drum</hi> and <hi>Rendesvouz'd</hi> without <hi>Commission;</hi> but
by virtue of our <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Association,</hi> we should
have had the grace to have taken Arms, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied,
without, and against Authority, and thus
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53578:15"/>
in that <hi>Critical Interregnum,</hi> we would have possess't
our selves of the Kingdom, and <hi>Massacred</hi> the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Addressers,</hi> before ever they could have agreed
upon a method of defence.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>I confess this would have been a very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<hi>dilemma,</hi> especially if you had nois'd it for a
<hi>Popish Plot,</hi> for if you had reported, that the
<hi>Assassins</hi> were <hi>Papists,</hi> that rumour would have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muzed
the Addressers, and so alarm'd the <hi>Vulgus,</hi>
that you might have effected your designs before
the discovery of the Cheat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ph.</speaker>
               <p>You may be sure we would have used that
customary Artifice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>But upon further Consideration, I fancy,
that the Addressers having engag'd in defence of
the <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and <hi>Lineal Succession;</hi> and knowing
their Lives and Fortunes were at Stake, in such a
desperate <hi>Crisis,</hi> would have had the wisdom to
Arm, and Unite, and secured their respective
Counties, 'till the quiet <hi>Inauguration</hi> of the next
<hi>Successor,</hi> and tho' this proceeding had been <hi>Illegal,</hi>
yet they should have hoped that the <hi>Merit</hi> of the
Service would have pleaded their <hi>Impunity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You know that in the <hi>Hurricane</hi> of the <hi>Popish
Plot,</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> resolved that if the King had
been <hi>Assassinated,</hi> they would have revenged his
Blood with a <hi>Massacre</hi> of all the <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
and now your Conspiracy is so notorious, that
should the King dye by Violence, the Vengeance
might fall upon your own heads, and Enraged
Addressers would cry in your own Language, <hi>Down
with them, Root and Branch.</hi>

               <p>Indeed if it could be supposed, that ever

               <p>Why, did not your most <hi>Christian King</hi>
make a League with the most <hi>Turkish Solyman</hi>
against <hi>Charles the Fifth?</hi> and why might not I,
by the same <hi>Christian</hi> Policy make an Alliance with
the <hi>Turk</hi> against <hi>Charles the Second?</hi> does not the

serve the <hi>Ottoman Interest?</hi> and I have heard of a

horrour, that all my <hi>Esquadron Volante,</hi> of <hi>Neuters</hi>

               <p>Alas, our Old seat at <hi>Westminster,</hi> is now no

<hi>Breath</hi> exhaled in <hi>Popular Harangues,</hi> that the inner

and hence proceeds that <hi>Magical</hi> power, that

               <p>I have known several Gentlemen in former times,

could discourse of nothing but <hi>Monarchy,</hi>

I might be ruined by my own precedents; for such

               <p>This Cheat must do, I see that <hi>Canting</hi> will

               <p>I think your <hi>Conscience</hi> is as well matcht as
our <hi>Charity;</hi> your <hi>Jesuits</hi> first taught me the art
of <hi>Canting,</hi> nay and to <hi>Cant</hi> too upon the very
<hi>Canticum Canticorum;</hi> for you know, the <hi>Virgin
Mary</hi> is the great <hi>Goddess</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the <hi>Good Old
Cause</hi> is the <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and you have been
guilty of more <hi>Blasphemy</hi> in <hi>Devotion</hi> to the <hi>One,</hi>
than ever I <hi>Canted</hi> in the service of the <hi>Other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your <hi>Jesuit <hi>Poza,</hi>
                  </hi> in his <hi>Elucidarium Deiparae,
lib. 2. p.</hi> 477. hath told the world, that, excepting
the <hi>Hypostatical Vnion,</hi> the <hi>Conception</hi> of the <hi>Virgin</hi>
was more <hi>miraculous,</hi> than that of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and that
the <hi>Virgin</hi> may be called, not only the <hi>Mother</hi> but
the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> p. 485. he would make us
believe, that her <hi>Body</hi> had such a perfection of
<hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Symmetry,</hi> that her formation was the
work of <hi>Forty Ages, lib. 3. p.</hi> 939. and thus the
Heavens and the Earth, which, at most, took but
six days in framing, must be thought the slight and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53578:19"/>
careless dash of <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> but the Creation of
the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> must be the only Elaborate work
and design of <hi>Infinite Wisdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And tho' <hi>Paul</hi> hath told us, that we must all be
<hi>Changed,</hi> before we can be fitted for that <hi>Celestial
State,</hi> yet <hi>Poza</hi> excepts the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and tells us,
her <hi>Natural Beauty</hi> was so <hi>Angelical,</hi> that she shall
suffer no <hi>Alteration,</hi> and that
God himself<note n="*" place="margin">Non enim Virginià mortuis resurgenti addi potuit à Domino corporis pulchritudo. <hi>Lib. 3. p.</hi> 947.</note> can add no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of the <hi>dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that her <hi>Stature</hi> was as prodigious as her
<hi>Beauty,</hi> he proves by this Argument: <hi>The</hi> Virgins
Smock, <hi>which</hi> Charles the Great <hi>Lodged in the</hi>
Cathedral <hi>of</hi> Aquisgran, <hi>at his return from</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,

               <p>The Beauty of some particular <hi>Parts</hi> he draws
from the <hi>Canticles,</hi> as that her <hi>Eyes</hi> were of an
<hi>Olive-green,</hi> appears from <hi>Canticles, 7. 4. Thine
Eyes are like the Fish-pools in</hi> Heshbon: Now because
the Text is not clear at first sight, therefore it is

That her <hi>Nose</hi> was strong and placed true as a

proves from <hi>Cant. 7. 4. Thy Nose is as the Tower of</hi>
Lebanon, <hi>which looketh towards</hi> Damascus.</p>
               <p>That her <hi>Lips</hi> were of a pure <hi>Vermilion</hi> is past

being disciplin'd in those <hi>Seraglio's,</hi> they would
become a kind of <hi>Janisaries,</hi> and be taught to destroy

               </p>
               <p>The whole <hi>Catholick Church</hi> did never look upon

               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Jews,</hi> they were a people so <hi>Base</hi> and
<hi>Earthy,</hi> that they would have allowed no time for
<hi>solemn devotion</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>diversion</hi> to their <hi>domesticks,</hi>
and therefore God was pleased, next to his own
honour, to provide for the ease and relaxation of
the <hi>Jewish Labourers,</hi> for without the Laws of
<hi>Sabbaths,</hi> the <hi>Jewish Servants</hi> had been as great
<hi>Slaves</hi> in <hi>Israel</hi> as their <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> were in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and would have found no <hi>Jubilee,</hi> but the day of
<hi>Death,</hi> and no <hi>Rest,</hi> but a <hi>Bed</hi> or a <hi>Grave:</hi> Therefore
it is evident, that God did design the <hi>Sabbath</hi> to be
a <hi>Cheerful Mixture,</hi> of <hi>devotion,</hi> and <hi>diversion,</hi> for
if that whole day must have been spent in the
<hi>Strictest Offices</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> that <hi>Restraint</hi> would

have been more <hi>tedious</hi> to the <hi>youth</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> of

have look't more like the <hi>Rigor</hi> of a <hi>fast,</hi> than the
<hi>favour</hi> of a <hi>Festival.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, That Law of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was a <hi>peculiar
Sanction</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and no more obliges the <hi>Christian
World,</hi> than the <hi>Sacrificing</hi> of <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Rams;</hi> now
what I have said in this case, I have not spoke as
a <hi>Pope,</hi> but the sense of a <hi>Common Catholick,</hi> and in

               <p>I tell them, that <hi>we Christians</hi> are bound to

it?</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>'Tis true, we are obliged to worship, fall
down and kneel, in our solemn Addresses to the
Divine Majesty, and to do this with as much Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Reverence as the <hi>Jews</hi> did in the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi>
or <hi>Temple,</hi> tho' your <hi>Ruder Modes</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>
look more like <hi>Affront,</hi> than adoration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:53578:24"/>
Nay, I grant that we have as much moral reason
to observe the <hi>Lords day,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> had for the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> but yet I can't think that
howling and whining, sadness and sower Faces
should be essential Sanctifications of a <hi>Festival;</hi>
Indeed the honour of God ought first to be consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by the solemn homage of <hi>Publick Religion,</hi> but
when that service is devoutly performed, I see
no profaneness in harmless and healthful diversions.</p>
               <p>When God enacted those <hi>Jewish Feasts</hi> of <hi>Weeks</hi>
and <hi>Tabernacles, Mirth</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
was made an essential
part of those Festivals,<note place="margin">Every Feast call'd, was call'd <hi>Sabbath</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </note> they were
as much obliged to rest from their
Servile Labours upon those days,<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 21.</note>
as they were upon the <hi>Sabbath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 16. 10.</note>
and to keep them as <hi>Solemn Feasts</hi>
to the <hi>Lord;</hi> no doubt but they did repair upon
those Feasts to a Holy place, and there did pay their
Religious Homage to the Lord of the whole Earth;
there they made a Solemn Commemoration of his
peculiar providences, and offered up their first
Fruits and Thanksgivings for the prosperity and
harvest of <hi>Israel;</hi> but when these Religious parts
were accomplish't, the rest of those Festivals were
to be spent in Mirth and Jollity, and that too, by
Divine Command, <hi>Deut. 16. 14. And thou shalt
rejoyce in thy Feast, thou and thy Son and thy Daughter,
and thy Man-servant, and thy Maid-servant, and the
Levite, the Stranger and the Fatherless, and the Widow,
that are within thy Gates:</hi> And that there might not
be the undecency of a Sigh, or a sad Thought, to
profane those Festivals, God repeats the injunction
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53578:25"/>
at the end of the <hi>fifteenth verse, Thou shalt surely
rejoyce:</hi> Now why the <hi>Jews</hi> should be allowed,
nay enjoyned to be <hi>Merry</hi> and <hi>Pleasant,</hi> upon <hi>their
Festivals,</hi> and we <hi>Christians</hi> should be <hi>sad,</hi> and <hi>severe,</hi>
upon <hi>Ours,</hi> I cannot understand; and therefore your
<hi>Sabbatarian</hi> delusion is to me one of the greatest
<hi>Miracles</hi> of <hi>Geneva.</hi>

               <p>But I tell the people, that we are bound to
design and endeavour perfection, and are always
obliged to do that which is most Religious: Now
certainly to Read the Bible is better than to play at
Football; to repeat Sermons is more Religious than
to Dance in a Circle; and sure Prayers, tho' shot
at Rovers, are fitter weapons for the <hi>Sabbath</hi> than
<hi>Bows</hi> and <hi>Arrows;</hi> and <hi>singing</hi> of <hi>Psalms</hi> is a more
Sanctified Musick than <hi>ringing</hi> of <hi>Bells.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>Whether those persons whose Heads under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
little more than their Feet, will not do less
mischief with <hi>Footballs</hi> than with <hi>Bibles,</hi> is a great
question at <hi>Rome,</hi> and whether the extravagance
of your <hi>Random-prayers</hi> have not more wounded
Religion, than all the <hi>Sunday-Bows</hi> and <hi>Arrows,</hi> may
be doubted too; and whether <hi>ringing</hi> of <hi>Bells</hi> be
not as solemn melody as <hi>singing</hi> of <hi>Psalms,</hi> may
admit dispute, especially in those places, where
there are <hi>Musical Bells</hi> and <hi>Mad Voices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But your whole argument is a meer <hi>Sophisme,</hi> and
is founded upon a <hi>false Postulatum,</hi> for we are not
always bound to do that which is most <hi>Religious;</hi>
indeed in matters which have a moral contrariety,
there we are always obliged to do that which is
good, and avoid that which is evil; but in two
actions, where neither is evil, we may in due cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53578:25"/>
do that which is <hi>Innocent,</hi> tho' not so
great an Office of Piety as the other.</p>
               <p>Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>Virginity</hi> is a <hi>purer
State</hi> than a <hi>Married Life,</hi> but yet if all Christians
should think themselves obliged to this <hi>Angelick
Perfection,</hi> and should neither <hi>Marry,</hi> nor be <hi>given</hi>
in <hi>Marriage,</hi> because 'tis most <hi>Pious</hi> not to <hi>Touch</hi> a
<hi>Woman, Christendom</hi> would be totally lost in the
next <hi>Century,</hi> and the whole Earth become the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To Pray, and to Worship God, are undoubtedly
greater Acts of Religion, than to Plow and to Trade,
but if all Christians should therefore desert the Shop,
and the Field, and spend their days in Clossets and
Temples, <hi>Christendom</hi> must be fed by Miracles; and
such superstition would look more like <hi>Frenzy</hi> than
<hi>Devotion,</hi> and therefore, tho' to Pray be a more
Pious office than to Plow, yet it is as Lawful in
just Circumstances, to Plow, as it is to Pray:
Thus tho' Preaching and Praying be more Religious
services, than <hi>Sport</hi> and <hi>Pastime,</hi> yet such recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as have no Moral Evil, and are not prohibited
by any Divine or Civil Law, are certainly Innocent,
and when the Publick Devotions of the <hi>Sunday</hi> be
duly performed, no man can offend by such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions.</p>
               <p>But tho' you use this argument for Popular se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement,
yet this is not your Rule of Practice:
No question but to <hi>Pray</hi> and <hi>Worship God</hi> is far more
Religious, than to <hi>Shed Blood,</hi> but yet you forgot
this <hi>Divinity</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Edg-hill,</hi> and made no
scruple of <hi>Murder,</hi> and <hi>Rebellion,</hi> tho' it was upon
that day, which you call the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:53578:26"/>
For <hi>Subjects</hi> to make <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> for
<hi>Kings,</hi> and all in <hi>Authority,</hi> and to live a Quiet life
in all Godliness, and Honesty, and to leave it to
the Lord of the whole world to influence the minds
of Princes, and to dispose of their persons and
Crowns; no question but this is far more Religious,
than to usurp the Divine Prerogative, and set up
whom we fancy, and pull down what Prince we
please, but yet you and I don't think our selves
obliged to this height of Perfection.</p>

in <hi>Ashes;</hi> I did expect that the <hi>Gunpowder</hi> would have
<hi>Sabbatized,</hi> and would not have been so <hi>Diabolical,</hi>
as to have flasht into <hi>Fire and Brimstone:</hi> However
I thought the <hi>Cannons</hi> might have prov'd like the
fiery Furnace, and have destroyed those men, who
kindled the Flame: But those Triumphing Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
being not revenged by any fire or Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53578:26"/>
from Heaven, I have lost my argument from

but I am secure of this advantage; for the
Church of <hi>England</hi> it self does contribute to this
delusion; for tho' <hi>Paul</hi> tell us, that the <hi>Ministration
written in Stone is done away,</hi> yet <hi>Moses</hi> is read every
<hi>Sabbath day</hi> in the <hi>English Churches,</hi> as well as in the

came just from Mount <hi>Horeb)</hi> proclaims with a loud
voice, <hi>Remember thou keepest holy the Sabbath day,</hi>
it is impossible the people should forget to <hi>Sabbatize,</hi>
and by this frequent Repetition of the <hi>Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> must be continued in

               <p>I see the Church of <hi>England</hi> was resolved
to have the <hi>Reformation</hi> according to <hi>Law,</hi> and after
the <hi>Patern</hi> of the <hi>Mount;</hi> but I wonder they are
not asham'd to Charge me with the Doctrine of
<hi>Equivocation,</hi> when they themselves do every <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:53578:27"/>
Equivocate both with God and Man: For the
people are enjoyn'd in express terms to observe the
<hi>Jewish Sanction</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and to keep <hi>Holy</hi> the
<hi>Seventh day,</hi> and yet all this time, the <hi>First day</hi> of
the <hi>Week</hi> is only <hi>Intended,</hi> and when that Law of
the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is fully pronounc't, the people are taught
to Pray, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our
hearts to keep THIS Law:</hi> So that the best sence,
which can be put upon that mistaken Ejaculation
is this, Lord we pray thee to give us grace to keep
the <hi>Seventh day,</hi> but thou knowest we mean the
<hi>first.</hi>

               <p>My <hi>Rabbi's</hi> tell me, that the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
being a <hi>Peculiar Sanction</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> were
never received into any ancient <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi>
or <hi>Latin Churches;</hi> but the inserting them into the
<hi>English Service</hi> was a very Fortunate Innovation, and
I shall improve the advantage; for the Church of
<hi>England</hi> is now under an inextricable <hi>Dilemma;</hi> if
they continue this <hi>Mosaical Sanction,</hi> as part of their
<hi>Christian Service,</hi> it must perpetuate the humor of
<hi>Judaizing:</hi> If they should alter or expunge the
Laws of <hi>Moses,</hi> it would cause such Popular Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries,
that they dare not adventure the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p>It is the opinion of some, that the <hi>Evangelical
Beatitudes</hi> were designed to answer the <hi>Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi>
and therefore like them were delivered
from the <hi>Mount;</hi> But yet if the <hi>Convocation</hi> should
place those <hi>Beatitudes,</hi> and the whole <hi>Pandect</hi> of
<hi>Christian Laws,</hi> in the room of the <hi>Two Tables,</hi> it
would not amount to popular Satisfaction, for the
Common people have as much, if not more, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53578:27"/>
for <hi>Moses,</hi> than they have for <hi>Christ;</hi> for
they do not murmur against the <hi>Pictures</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>Aaron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> tho' expos'd in their holy places; but
if these two <hi>Jewish Saints</hi> were removed, and the
Pictures of <hi>Christ and his Apostles</hi> introduced into
<hi>Churches,</hi> the people would clamour against the
change as rank <hi>Popery.</hi>

               <p>Well, you have abundantly convinc't me,
that a <hi>Judaizing Puritanisme</hi> must continue in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as long as the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book;</hi> but have you
no other Stratagem to propogate the <hi>Good Old
Cause?</hi>

               <p>Truly at present I have no more in prospect,
but only the hopes of a <hi>Toleration;</hi> to have our
Religious exercises confin'd to <hi>Private Families,</hi>
is like the restraint of <hi>Simple Marriage,</hi> and will
never propagate with expedition, but a <hi>Toleration</hi>
is a kind of <hi>Spiritual Polygamy,</hi> and if I can once
again but espouse the Teeming Crowds, we shall
Multiply like <hi>Jews,</hi> and bring forth <hi>Captains</hi> of
<hi>Fifties,</hi> and <hi>Captains</hi> of <hi>Hundreds,</hi> and <hi>Captains</hi>
of
<hi>Thousands.</hi>

               <p>If ever you have an <hi>Indulgence,</hi> you must
thank <hi>Rome</hi> for the favour; but you can never
expect it upon the account of your own Merit,
for all your <hi>Plots,</hi> and <hi>Associations,</hi> your <hi>Insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
and <hi>Conspiracies,</hi> are dated from the <hi>Last In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,</hi>
and tho' the King might forget that you
denied his Father the favour of his own <hi>Chaplains,</hi>
yet he can't but remember, how you <hi>abused</hi> his
<hi>Grace,</hi> and what where the <hi>mischiefs</hi> of the <hi>Late
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53578:28"/>
Toleration;</hi> and therefore I am afraid you will
be deceiv'd in the hopes of a <hi>Second Indulgence.</hi>

               <p>To give the King his due, he is a Prince
of great Humanity and good Nature, and his
anger being appeas'd by a few bloody Sacrifices,
I hope he may be persuaded that a freedom of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
in matters of Religion is the most <hi>Sacred
Right,</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Subject,</hi> and that such
an Act of Grace would produce an <hi>Vniversal Calm,</hi>
and force <hi>Assassins</hi> to adore him; I know he can't
long endure to hear the Grones and Doleful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of ruin'd Families, who pine under the
pressure of <hi>Poenal Laws,</hi> and since it is no time to
affront him, I am resolv'd to appear as <hi>Patient</hi>
as a <hi>Primitive Martyr;</hi> and thus I do hope that
by the Intercession of mighty Friends, and the
artifice of a feigned Humility, I may at length
attain the <hi>Jubilee</hi> of a <hi>Second Indulgence,</hi> and
then—</p>
               <p>But pray tell me, what is your Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Toleration?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Po.</speaker>
               <p>I have a very good Opinion of a <hi>Toleration</hi>
in <hi>England,</hi> but I will never allow it at <hi>Rome,</hi> for
I am of the same mind with your <hi>Presbyterian,</hi>
that if the Devil were to beg a favour, he would
petition for an <hi>Vniversal Toleration,</hi> for beside the
ill consequences of <hi>State-factions,</hi> and <hi>fierce Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities,</hi>
an Allowance of so many Divisions and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties
in Religion, must occasion an <hi>Indifferency</hi> in
looser minds, and make them dispute the very
<hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and therefore I believe that a <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
tends more to <hi>Atheisme,</hi> than the <hi>Spanish
Inquisition.</hi>

               <p>

But now I must leave you, and consult with
the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Venetian Ambassadours</hi> concerning
that grand Affair of the <hi>Turkish War;</hi> and since
you are resolv'd for <hi>England</hi> again, I wish you a
