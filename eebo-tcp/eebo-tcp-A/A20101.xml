         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the money, and how honest men may auoide them. First
know your pocket is drawne vp, that he may the easier come by
your purse with two fingers, onely the fore-finger and the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
and with that forke, he cetches hold not of the lining, nor
on the side next your skin, but the other: for if hee should faste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

him sooner then on the other. When hauing drawne your poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
vp, till he can reach your purse, it is then gon with the least
twitch nay by this meanes of drawing, If your money be loose,
they will turne you the case cleane out, and the bit, into their
hands, now for the sharing of this bit, as they call it, your <hi>Stall</hi>
is equall part with your foyst, if the foyst his none, which is
shift some aside, ere they come to sharing, but your snap has his
wages at their discretion.</p>
            <p>For the manner to auoide them, though their cunning bee
great, it is very easie, which is, if euer you take any, to hang
them, and let not this composition preuaile with you, for that

so strong a garrison, and who be those but <hi>Serieants?</hi> Serieants
are the cunning pilots that in all stormes bring men safely to

poynts of that compasse, are the customs of the Cittye, vppon
which whosoeuer kéepes not directly, he runs himselfe on the
sands, and so sincks, or vpon rocks, and so splits.</p>
            <p>Serieants are those nymble-footed <hi>Cenii,</hi> that walke at mens
elbowes (on either side, one) to kéepe them vpright. They are
neither <hi>Russians</hi> nor <hi>Turkes</hi> (though some count them) that beat

coldly an ill word from their mouth goes to a mans hart, (when
any by chance fall into their company, they presently play the
phisitions, and counsell him to step into a Zauerne, &amp; to drinck
wine to comfort his poore hart, or if wine doe no good, then to
send for his friends aboute him, to try if the sight of them can
make him any better, and this is an act pitious and charitable.
So that to a man that is meatefyed in flesh, and whose state (in

this world) is desperate, a Sergiant may serue instead of a
Deaths head, to put him in minde of his last day, and what hee
is to come to.</p>

and thereby likewise haue they an Atcheiuement of honor: for

to open mens harts and make them looke into their estates
and by looking to know themselues, which the <hi>Philosopher</hi> saith

<hi>Clauus</hi> is also a club, the double propertie of which is in euery

and to guard the <hi>Right;</hi> he must as soone strike the rich, as the

he is like death to spare no man. All which attributes, necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
