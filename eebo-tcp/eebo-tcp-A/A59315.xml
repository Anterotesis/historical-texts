         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LADY <hi>HENRIETTA WENTWORTH,</hi> BARONESS OF NETTLESTED.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Ought to beg your Ladyſhips Pardon, when I lay ſo inconſiderable a Trifle as a Play at your Ladyſhips Feet; the acceſs to ſo much Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity being that difficult awful Bleſſing, that nothing mean or unhallowed ſhould dare to aſpire to. Yet Greatneſs and Beauty, whatever Awe they may ſtrike into all other Adorers, are not defended from the bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Devotions of Poetry: For ſuch is the Poets Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, that they have ſo long convers'd with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>in Effigie,</hi> till they have borrowed their Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Heroes they write, and their Confidence from the Stage that repreſents them.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, we live in an Age ſo Critical and ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
<pb facs="tcp:50758:3"/>
that the Muſes melancholy Groves grow every day more deſolate, and even their ſofteſt Ayres to the late untunable Ears ſound harſh and unpleaſant; poor Poetry being ſo maliciouſly perſecuted, that nothing but the Patronage of a Great Name can give it a Paſs, to go peaceably and unmoleſted: And in theſe Circumſtances, Self-preſervation and Security make our Boldneſs a little more excuſable.</p>
            <p>The pooreſt ragged Traveller that ſeeks a Shelter in a Storm, though under the Battlements of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Palace is not much to be blamed. This 'tis that makes Poetry always come into the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Umbrage of Quality, whilſt Poets, like their blind Original, never venture abroad without a Guide. Nor can even the weakeſt Brother of the Muſes fail, when Greatneſs and Beauty are at once its powerful Supporters. The Lady <hi>Henrietta</hi>'s Name will prove a Charm againſt the ſharpeſt Criticks. What Malice dares ſtrike where ſo much Beauty ſhields? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Wit can hope for no Succeſs but when favored by the Fair; and 'tis by their Influence alone, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, if ever, can be made immortal; who in return can but faintly pay their Tribute to a Power ſo favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſince your Ladyſhip has a far greater Title to be Eternal in the Records of Fame, from the vaſt
<pb facs="tcp:50758:3"/>
Merits of your Illuſtrious Anceſtors, than all the <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> ſince the World began can make you.</p>
            <p>The Famous Earl of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> and the no leſs Famous Lord <hi>Wentworth,</hi> both Generals under our late Sacred Majeſty, are thoſe never-to-be-forgotten Heroes, that whilſt the World ſhall have an Ear, and Wonder a Tongue, ſhall never want a Name: Worthies of that generous Zeal, and indefatigable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, till they drein'd their Eſtates ſo low, that the fought even to the Nakedneſs of a Gladiator. Their Loyalty, and the Service of their King, being not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Study, but their Religion; inſomuch, that like him that reſignes his Share in the World for an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Heaven, they were ſo little dejected even at Ruine it ſelf, when in a Cauſe ſo Glorious, that they bore the very <hi>Pouerty</hi> of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> with the <hi>Pride</hi> of <hi>Triumphers</hi> and the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of <hi>Martyrs:</hi> And to attain the higheſt Character of Perfection that Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity ever reacht, with the Bravery and Courage of an <hi>Alexander,</hi> they had the Peace and Content of a <hi>Diogenes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But their Honorable Loſſes your Ladyſhips kinder Stars have amply repaid: And all thoſe Debts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence thoſe Loyal Sufferers did not live long enough to receive; their Arrears of Glory, are in your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
<pb facs="tcp:50758:4"/>
compleater Happineſs entail'd on their Poſterity. The Lady <hi>Henrietta</hi> has a Perſon and a Mind ſo richly endowed, and to theſe that Prodigious Maſs of Worldly Bleſſings, as if Providence had ſtudied to adde new Ornaments to Her, whoſe Birth, Charms and Vertues in themſelves alone, render'd her a Beauty inacceſſible. So juſt it is, that ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Perfections ſhould be no little Care of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that are ſo great a part of it. But in the ſtrange and proſperous Recovery of your Ladyſhips exhauſted Patrimonies, the unexampled Induſtry of the Lady <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> your Ladyſhips pious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to her immortal praiſe, will never be forgotten. When Fate, by a too early Stroak, had rob'd her of her dear Lord, ſhe ſtept into a <hi>Seat</hi> ſo ſtrangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh'd, beheld thoſe Ruines of an Eſtate where the Thunder of the War had made the Deſolation ſo low, and the Breaches ſo wide, that the frightful Proſpect would have daunted a more than Female <hi>Spirit:</hi> where all hopes of Re-building would appear an Attempt altogether impoſſible. Yet that Attempt the bolder Lady <hi>Philadelphia</hi> reſolved and finiſh'd; ſtemm'd all the adverſe Tides of Fortune, to gather up her Family's <hi>Shipwracks;</hi> and with that incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Pains,</hi> and no leſs wonderful <hi>Succeſs,</hi> that ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:50758:4"/>
has rather created than repaired an Eſtate; has mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly heaped together an infinite Treaſure with no leſs Toil than if ſhe had labor'd in the Mine, and dig'd the very Oar that form'd it. Never was a loſing Hand ſo ingeniouſly play'd, nor a laſt Stake ſo artfully managed. Her Happineſs, her Love and Life were ſo lodged in her only Hopes, her fair young Darling <hi>Henrietta,</hi> that for her dear ſake, to advance her growing promiſing Glory, ſhe acted with a Zeal ſo vigorous, as if ſhe had taken a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution even to out-do the <hi>Pelican.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as your Ladyſhips Loyal Anceſtors, thoſe two memorable Engliſh Champions, are that ſhining Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that Fame, when ſhe paints any thing that's Heroick might for ever Copy from. So they are no leſs bleſt in an Heireſs, whoſe Majeſtick Beauty to theirs, and her own Eternal Monument, might ſit for a <hi>Britannia.</hi> Your Royal Godfather might very frankly and largly promiſe Wonders in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Henrietta</hi>'s Name: For 'twas impoſſible there ſhould be any common Branch from a Stock ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Illuſtrious. How then am I, beyond all meaſure, happy, thus Gloriouſly protected? methinks I look with Scorn upon the cenſorious World, and can defie my Enemies with as great Aſſurance as if I had the
<pb facs="tcp:50758:5"/>
               <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Swords</hi> of thoſe prodigious Heroes. And 'tis no ſmall Pride to me, when I conſider I am the firſt of thoſe many Writers to come that have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the glorious Preferment of thus publickly writing my ſelf,</p>
