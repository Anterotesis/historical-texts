            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet these the common people of wit blow up with their breath of praise, and honour with the Sacred name of Poets: To which as I beleeve they can never have any just claime, so shall I not dare by this essay to lay any title, since more sweate and oyle he must spend, who shall arrogate so excellent an attribute.

In all those flames in which I burnt, I never felt a wanton heate, nor was my invention ever sinister from the straite way of chastity. And when love builds upon that rocke, it may safely contemne the battery of the waves, and threatnings of the wind.

The Alabaster, Ivory, Porphir, Iet, that lent an admirable beauty to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward building, entertained me with but a halfe pleasure, since they stood there onely to make sport for ruine. But when my soule grew acquainted with the owner of that mansion; I sound that Oratory was dombe when it began to speake her, and wonder (which must necessarily seize the best at that time) a lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, that dulled too much the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the minde, onely fit to busie themselves in discoursing her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Wisdome, I encounter'd there, that could not spend it selfe

since it affected silence, attentive onely to instructions, as if all her sences had beene contracted into hearing: Innocencie, so not vitiated by conversation with the world, that the subtile witted of her sex, would have tearm'd it ignorance: Wit, which seated it selfe most in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, and if not inforc't by good manners, would scarce have gain'd the name of affability.

However such I fancied her, for to say shee is, or was such, were to play the Merchant, and boast too much the value of a lewell I possesse, but have no minde to part with.

Nothing new is free from detraction, and when Princes alter customes even heavie to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, best ordinances are interpreted innovations. Had I slept in the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of my acquaintance, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted no study beyond that which the chase or field allowes, Poetry had then beene no scandall upon me, and

But what malice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in the Country upon ignorance, or in the City upon Criticisme, shall prepare against me, I am armed to endure. For as the face of vertue lookes faire without the adultery of Art, so fame needes no ayde from rumour to strengthen her selfe. If these lines want that courtship, (I will not say flattery) which insinuates it selfe into the favour of great men, best; they partake of my modesty: If Satyre to win applause with the envious multitude; they expresse my content, which maliceth none, the fruition of that, they esteeme happie.

She is chaste, for the devill enters the Idoll and gives the Oracle, when wantonnesse pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth beauty, and wit maintaines it lawfull. She is as faire as Nature intended her, helpt perhaps to a more pleasing grace by the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of education, not by the slight of Art.

                     </gap>ne, for vice is too strong to be wrastled with, and gives her frailty the foyle. She is not proude, though the amorous youth interpret her modestie to that sence; but in her vertue weares so much Majestie, lust dares not rebell, nor though mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued, under the pretence of love, capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate with her. She entertaines not eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parley offer'd, although the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles pretended to her advantage: advice and her owne feares restraine her, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man never owed ruine to too much caution. She glories not in the plurality of servants, a multitude of adorers heaven can onely challeng; and it is impietie in her weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to desire superstition from many. She is deafe to the whispers of love, and even on the marriage houre can breake off, without the least suspition of scandall, to the former

liberty of her carriage. She avoydes a too neere conversation with man, and like the Parthian overcomes by flight. Her lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is not copious but apposit, and she had rather suffer the reproach of being dull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, than have the title of Witty, with that of Bold and Wanton. In her carriage she is sober, and thinkes her youth expresseth life enough, without the giddy motion, fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of late hath taken up. She danceth to the best applause but doates not on the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, nor licenceth an irregular meeting to vaunt the levity of her skill. She sings, but not perpetually, for she knowes, silence in woman is the most perswading oratory. She never arriv'd to so much familiarity with man as to know the demunitive of his name, and call him by it; and she can show a competent favour: without yeelding her hand to his gripe. Shee never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the language of a kisse, but at salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

nor dares the Courtier use so much of his practised impudence as to offer the rape of it from her; because chastity hath write it unlawfull, and her behaviour proclaimes it unwelcome. She is never sad, and yet not jiggish; her conscience is cleere from guilt, and that secures her from sorrow. She is not passionately in love with poetry, because it softens the heart too much to love: but she likes the harmony in the Composition; and the brave examples of vertue celebrated by it, she proposeth to her imitation. She is not vaine in the history of her gay kindred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

She is not ambitious to be prais'd, and yet vallues death beneath infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.


<pb facs="tcp:3769:11"/>
And Ile conclude, (though the next sinod of Ladies condemne this character as an heresie broacht by a Precision) that onely she who hath as great a share in vertue as in beauty, deserves a noble love to serve her, and a free Poesie to speake her.</p>

Without her, Man if pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not restraine him; is the creator of sinne; or, if an innated cold render him not onely the businesse of the present age; the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of posterity. She is so religious that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day crownes her a martyr, and her zeale

Shee is so true a friend, her Husband may to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate even his ambitions, and if successe Crowne not expectation, remaine neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse uncontemn'd, Shee is colleague with him in the Empire of prosperity; and a safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyring place when adversity exiles him from the World. Shee is so chaste, shee never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the language lust speakes in, nor with a smile applaudes it, although there appeare wit in the Metaphore. Shee is faire onely to winne on his affections, nor would she be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris of the most eloquent beauty; if there were danger, that might perswade the passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate auditory, to the least irregular thought. Shee is noble by a long descent, but her memory is so evill a herald, Shee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver boasts the story of her Ancestors. Shee is so moderately rich, that the defect of portion doth neither bring penury to his estate, nor the superfluity licence her to Riot. Shee is

liberall, and yet owes not ruine to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but knowes Charity, to be the soule of goodnesse, and Uertue without reward often prone to bee her owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer. Shee is much at home, and when shee visits 'tis for mutuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, not for intelligence. Shee can goe to Court, and returne no passionate doa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on bravery; and when shee hath seene the gay things muster up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves there, shee considers them as Cobwebs the Spider vanity hath spunne. Shee is so generall in her acquaintance, that shee is familiar with all whom fame speakes vertuous; but thinkes there can bee no friendship but with one; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath neither shee friend nor private servant. Shee so squares her passion to her Husbands fortunes, that in the Countrey shee lives without a froward Melancholly, in

Shee is inquisitive onely of new wayes to please him, and her wit sayles by no other compasse then that of his direction. Shee lookes upon him as Conjurers upon the Circle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which there is nothing but Death and Hell; and in him shee beleeves Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice circumscrib'd. His vertues are her wonder and imitation; and his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, her credulitie thinkes no more frailtie, then makes him descend to the title of Man.

He is vertuous, for love begot in sin is a mishapen monster, and seldome out-lives his birth.

to action. He is so valiant, feare could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be listned to, when she whisper'd danger; and yet fights not, unlesse religion confirmes the quarrell lawfull. He submits his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the government of vertue, not to the wilde decrees of popular opinion; and when his conscience is fully satisfied, he cares not how mistake and ignorance interpret him. He hath so much fortitude he can forgive an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie; and when hee hath overthrowne his opposer, not insult upon his weaknesse. Hee is an absolute governor; no destroyer of his passions, which he imployes to the noble in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of vertue. He is wise, for who hopes to reape a harvest from the sands, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the perfect offices of friendship from a foole. He hath by a liberall education beene softned to civility; for that rugged honesty some rude men professe, is an indigested Chaos; which may containe the seedes of goodnesse, but it wants forme and order.</p>

He is neither effeminate, nor a common courtier; the first is so passionate a doater upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, hee cannot spare love enough: to bee justly named friendship: the latter hath his love so diffusive among the beauties, that man is not considerable. He is not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed to any sordid way of gaine, for who is any way mechanicke, will sell his friend upon more profitable termes.

He is open in expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his thoughts and easeth his melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by inlarging it; and no Sanctuary preserves so safely, as he his friend afflicted.

In prosperity he gratefully admires the bounty of the Almighty giver, and useth, not abuseth plenty: But in adversity hee remaines unshaken, and like some eminent mountaine hath his head above the clouds. For his happinesse is not meteor-like exhaled from the vapors of this world; but shines a fixt starre, which when by misfortune it appeares to fall, onely casts away the slimie matter. Poverty he neither feares nor covets, but cheerefully entertaines; imagining it the fire which tries vertue: Nor how tyrannically

Fame he weighes not, but esteemes a smoake, yet such as carries with it the sweetest odour, and riseth usually from the Sacrifice of our best actions. Pride he disdaines, when he findes it swelling in himselfe; but easily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth it in another: Nor can any mans error in life, make him sinne in censure, since sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome the folly we condemne is so culpable as the severity of our judgement. He doth not malice the over-spreading growth of his aequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude he remembers his better part is Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall; and therefore his minde practiseth the best discourse without assistance of inferiour Organs.

in a charitable silence, whose manners he reformes not by invectives but example: In prayer he is frequent not apparent: yet as he labours not the opinion, so he foares not the scandall of being thought good. He every day travailes his meditations up to heaven, and never findes himself wearied with the journey: but when the necessities of nature returne him downe to earth, he esteemes it a place, hee is condemned to. Devotion is his Mistresse en which he is passionately enamord: for that he hath found the most Soveraigne antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganst sinne, and the onely balsome powerfull to cure those wounds hee hath receav'd through frailety. To live he knowes a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and the contempt of it ingratitude, and therefore loves, but not doates on life. Death how deformed soever an aspect it weares, he is not frighted with: since it not annihilates, but uncloudes the soule. He therefore stands
