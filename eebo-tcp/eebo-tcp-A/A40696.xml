            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE True MOTHER OF THE Pretended <hi>PRINCE</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> DISCOVERED.</head>
            <p>IN <hi>May, Anno Dom.</hi> 1688. the Counteſs of <hi>Tyrconnel,</hi> (whoſe Zeal for the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Cauſe and Service, is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the World) came from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> in the <hi>Monmouth Yatch,</hi> Capt. <hi>Wright,</hi> Commander; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides her own Daughters and Servants that attended her hither, brought over <hi>Two Gentlewomen,</hi> both big with Child: The <hi>Firſt</hi> of which, was about <hi>Thirty</hi> Years of Age, a luſty and healthful Countenanced Woman: The <hi>Second</hi> was a tall and ſlender Woman, darkiſh
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94786:6"/>
Hair'd, and ſomething above <hi>Twenty:</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe Women was brought to Bed at St. <hi>Albans,</hi> in her way to <hi>London:</hi> The <hi>Second,</hi> (whoſe Name was Mrs. <hi>Grey</hi>) was conveyed to St. <hi>James</hi>'s Palace, and was Lodged in two private Rooms, <hi>over</hi> or <hi>within</hi> the Lady <hi>Strickland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s</hi> Lodgings, in the <hi>Narrow Gallery,</hi> between the <hi>Queens</hi>'s Appartment, and the great Chappel. In theſe Lodgings, this <hi>Young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was Delivered on <hi>Sunday-Morning,</hi> the <hi>Tenth</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> the ſame day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and but a little time before the late <hi>Queen</hi> pretended to be Delivered of a <hi>Prince of Wales.</hi> About the latter end of <hi>June.</hi> this <hi>Young Gentlewoman</hi> was removed from thoſe Lodgings to the Marchioneſs of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wis</hi>'s Appartment, which was in the ſame Gallery; ſhe being then Governeſs to the pretended <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> and to whoſe Charge and Care this Lady was particularly Committed.</p>
            <p>At that very time, was I in the Marchioneſs Family; and, by her ſpecial
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94786:6"/>
Commands, daily and almoſt hourly attended the ſaid <hi>Young Gentlewoman;</hi> being ordered to ſupply her with all Neceſſaries, and do all other Offices of Service, during her Continuance at St. <hi>James</hi>'s; her preſent Indiſpoſition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a more than ordinary Aſſiduity and Attendance upon her.</p>
            <p>During her ſaid continuance at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, ſhe was very little Viſited by any Perſon, but the Marchioneſs her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf, excepting ſome of her Women in proper Occaſions of Female Nurſery and Service; appearing by this, to be ſome more than ordinary Charge of the Marchioneſs's: She ſeemed very well contented with her Entertainment, and the Marchioneſs's Care and Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her: and was hardly ever, or (at leaſt) very ſeldom deſirous to ſtir over the Threſhold of her own Lodgings; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſometimes, that ſhe expreſt a deſire, and that (as I obſerved) with a particular Zeal and Delight to go and Viſit the <hi>Young Prince,</hi> which was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94786:7"/>
granted her; and whither I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her by the Marchioneſs's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and waited on her back again. Amongſt the general Devoirs that were then publickly paid to that young <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,</hi> I remarkt, that nothing appeared ſo warmly fond as her ſelf; and when (as a peculiar Favour) ſhe was permitted to take him in her Arms, her Kiſſes and Embraces ſeemed more than uſually Tender and Paſſionate.</p>
            <p>About the middle of <hi>July</hi> following, when her Health and Strength were viſibly improved, it was thought fit, by ſome Authority from Above, that ſhe ſhould be Tranſported into <hi>France;</hi> and accordingly one Father <hi>Sabran,</hi> and one Mrs. <hi>Jones,</hi> and my ſelf, by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, attended her to <hi>Dover,</hi> in order to her Voyage.</p>
            <p>Before her Departure, I obſerved, that ſhe ſeemed mightily concerned at her leaving <hi>England;</hi> and in my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both before, and all the way to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> expreſt a great deal of Trouble
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94786:7"/>
on that account, as compelled to viſit <hi>France</hi> much againſt her Inclination; which I the more wondred at, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſhe was a Native of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and had not been two Months in this Kingdom. And before ſhe took her leave of the <hi>Court,</hi> ſhe deſired to Pay her laſt Duty to the Queen; and here taking her farewel of the <hi>Young Prince,</hi> ſhe betrayed that extraordinary Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Weakneſs, that ſhe melted into down right Tears.</p>
            <p>When ſhe arrived at <hi>Dover,</hi> ſhe was met by one Father <hi>Grey,</hi> (her ſuppoſed Brother, or ſuch he pretended himſelf) a <hi>Secular Priest,</hi> and an <hi>Irish-man,</hi> with whom ſhe Embarked for <hi>Calais,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be conveyed to the <hi>Convent</hi> of <hi>Benedictine Nuns</hi> in <hi>Paris;</hi> ſhe having been in a <hi>Nunnery</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſometime before ſhe came for <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the <hi>new Happy Revolution,</hi> the Winter following, and King <hi>James</hi>`s <hi>Abdication,</hi> I being at that time Servant

to her Majeſty in <hi>France,</hi> commended and prefer`d to her <hi>Majeſty`s Service,</hi> by my kind <hi>Patroneſs</hi> the <hi>Marchioneſs</hi> of <hi>Powis;</hi> and the late Queen repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a peculiar <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> in <hi>my Fidelity,</hi> from the Character ſhe had received of me from the <hi>Marchioneſs;</hi> I proceed to let you know, That in <hi>February</hi> 1689, I being at <hi>St. Germains,</hi> (the late Queens <hi>Court</hi> in <hi>France</hi>) was one <hi>Sunday-Night</hi> ordered to attend the Queen immediately, Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> being, as was reported, Indiſpoſed, (it ſeems with a Fright, which made Her keep her Chamber) where I attending Her <hi>Commands,</hi> Her <hi>Majeſty</hi> told me, I muſt immediately prepare to go to <hi>England,</hi> with ſome Letters to the Lord <hi>Montgemery</hi> and <hi>Others,</hi> about extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

            <p>This was the <hi>Contents</hi> of the <hi>Queens</hi> Letters, and what I had Orders to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Lord <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and Others of his <hi>Party,</hi> which the <hi>Ring,</hi> as a <hi>Token</hi> was to Confirm.

return with him to St. <hi>Germains</hi> again, were we arrived the next Night; and then waiting on the <hi>Queen,</hi> ſhe told me, <hi>The lost Sheep was found at a private Houſe in</hi> Paris; and as I afterwards ſoon underſtood, was then in the ſame <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery</hi> again, under the care of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs</hi> of <hi>Suſſex</hi> and others.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94786:11"/>
late Queen: Then the Womam, <hi>Sabran,</hi> and my ſelf, were conducted by a Prieſt, a <hi>Chaplain</hi> of the Arch-Biſhops, private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>French King's</hi> Back Stairs: The Woman lamenting her Fate, which ſhe ſaid was occaſioned by her laſt being in <hi>England;</hi> ſhe grieved to that exceſs, that ſhe Fainted ſeveral times, before they could get her up the Stairs to the <hi>French King</hi>'s Apartment, whither ſhe was conducted by a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued about half an Hour, with the <hi>French King,</hi> and the late Queen. During which time, I waited with Father <hi>Sabran</hi> at the bottom of the Stairs, till ſhe came down with the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> that conveyed her up; at which time ſhe wept bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and told Father <hi>Sabran</hi> and me, <hi>That now ſhe muſt take her Everlaſting Farewel of us:</hi> and ſo was carried away by the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> and never more ſeen or heard of, notwithſtanding my moſt diligent Inquiry after her at all the <hi>Engliſh, Scotch</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Nunneries</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> and other Places, where I had great Acquaintance
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94786:11"/>
and where, led by my extraordinary Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity in this Affair, I was not a little inquiſitive to learn, if poſſible, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe</hi> of this unfortunate Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman; as indeed, I had been all along little other than a Spy upon her, and her concerns, relating to that <hi>Young Child.</hi> I confeſs, I had but ſmall occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of given my ſelf this needleſs trouble of making the aforeſaid Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For Father <hi>Sabran,</hi> who (I forgot to tell my Reader) was Chaplain to the Young Prince, and is now his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, did frankly own to me the ſame Evening they left her, <hi>That he believed ſhe would not be alive the Day following, nor was it fit ſhe ſhould live.</hi> I might have reſted ſatisfied with what <hi>Sabran</hi> told me, it being undoubtedly too much of Truth: However, as it could not enter into my heart, to think it poſſible there ſhould be ſuch Inhuman Barbarity in the World, as to Murder a poor Woman in cold Blood, and that too by the Commands of Crowned Heads;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94786:12"/>
my own good Nature in Tenderneſs for the poor Creature, inclined me to the ſaid inquiry about her.</p>
            <p>Beſides my own knowledge in this Affair, there have been ſeveral Letters and Papars found in Mrs. <hi>Labodies</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers's Trunk, now ſtill to be produced, Relating to this Gentlewoman; beſides ſeveral corroborative Proffs from divers <hi>Perſons</hi> of <hi>Quality</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and others, as alſo Capt. <hi>Wright,</hi> that brought her over from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the other Capt. that carried her over into <hi>France,</hi> that are able to give a great Light into the Diſcovery of this <hi>Grand Impoſture:</hi> Nor were the Managers of this Affair any ways wanting in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Two Big-Bellied Women toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if One String failed the other might hit.</p>
            <p>As for the Child, he is a very Brisk and Airy, no ways Deformed in his Limbs, but a Ruddy <hi>Complexion,</hi> fair Hair, and Dark coloured brisk Eyes. He, when but Two Years Old, was a great lover

None dare croſs him, for he is ſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory, that upon the leaſt Occaſion, he will hold his Breath to that degree, that the <hi>Queen</hi> and all about him, have thought him really Dead.</p>
            <p>As to my firſt Introduction to this Truſt and Knowledge into the Affairs of the late <hi>Court.</hi> I muſt inform my Reader, (that by Sir <hi>John Burrows,</hi> a Zealous <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and my particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, and the Marqueſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> (to whom by the Mother ſide, I had the Honour to be a little Related) I was prefered to be a <hi>Page</hi> to the Counteſs of <hi>Melford:</hi> From her Service, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the Marqueſs`s Family,

prevented <hi>Crone</hi>'s Tryal; but it pleaſing Almighty God to reſtore me to my Health again, after Ten Weeks Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I was able to come to the <hi>Old-Baily,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Crone</hi> was Tryed, and Condemned for High - Treaſon: He had ſeveral Reprieves from time to time, on his Promiſe of making a full Confeſſion; but as he was lingring it out, about Six Months after his Conviction, I Receiv'd a Letter at my Lodgings in the <hi>Pall-mall</hi> from the Earl of <hi>Melford,</hi> King <hi>James</hi>'s Secretary, in which I was promiſed King <hi>James</hi>'s Pardon, and all the Favour I could deſire from him, and the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and Five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds down, if I would return to <hi>France,</hi> and Recant from what I had done: I carried this Letter to the King, who ſent me to the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt,</hi> for his Advice, how far I might proceed by Law, thinking thereby to diſcover ſomething more; but his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſeveral others were of Opinion, that it was a Trick, purely to invalidate
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94786:18"/>
my Evidence; They ſtill being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of Mr. <hi>Crone</hi>'s Confeſſion, which they knew muſt be ſo agreeable to my Informations, that the Heads of King <hi>James</hi>'s Friends had been intirely at King <hi>William</hi>'s Mercy: And this Matter highly concern'd the <hi>French</hi> Court; for, had <hi>Crone</hi> been juſt to Him that gave him his Life, there might have been but ſmall Incouragement from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> long ſince; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, no Plotting now. They of King <hi>James</hi>'s. Party (as well has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the Court) made it their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to have <hi>Crone</hi> Hang'd, to ſtop his Mouth; and that as I am well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, occaſioned his making almoſt a full Diſcovery: Though he went for <hi>France</hi> as ſoon as he was let out of <hi>Newgate,</hi> being invited back with great Promiſes, as I before had been. I muſt thank him for his Juſtice to me, in his laſt, and moſt Authentick Confeſſion: He affirms on Oath, That all my Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was true; for the Confirmation
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94786:19"/>
of this, I can appeal to any Member of Parliament that heard Mr. <hi>Crone</hi>'s, or the Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s Confeſſions Read, before the Honourable <hi>Houſe of Commons.</hi> After this, it may ſeem ſtrange to ſome, how the Houſe came to be ſo angry with me: I beg leave to inform ſuch, That the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Crone</hi>'s go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, knew they had partly ſecured themſelves from the juſt Power of the Law; but were yet concern'd, if poſſible to make the World believe, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any Deſign againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And who can blame them for being aſhamed of ſuch a Horrid, and Bloody Deſign, as they had then contrived againſt the Government and their own Countrey, to Ruine both Church &amp; State? To cover their Shame as much as may be, they had no way but to Invalidate me; which they ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with all the Malice that the Devil, or Popiſh Principles cou'd incite them with; though for ſome time my faithful Service, and the King's large Promiſes
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94786:19"/>
of laſting Favours to me, was my Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and had continued ſo, but that the Immaturity of my Judgment was ſo eaſily impos'd upon, by Two Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſent by the <hi>French</hi> Court, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh my Ruin, <hi>viz.</hi> Colonel <hi>Tho. Dellaval,</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Hayes:</hi> They were formerly my moſt intimate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance both in <hi>England</hi> and at the Court at St. <hi>Germains,</hi> and were imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſtantly' twixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> on King <hi>James</hi>'s Account, as I was: The Firſt of theſe came to me at my Lodgings in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and told me, He deſired to come and Serve the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as I had done, provided I wou'd intercede with the Queen for his Pardon, and make ſome Conditions for his coming over Honourably. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Queen of it immediately, the King being then in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and Her Majeſty, (whoſe Bounty extended to all,) did moſt Graciouſly promiſe to Write to the King about it; and, in the mean time, committed the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94786:20"/>
of this Affair to the Care of His Grace, <hi>John</hi> Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> (my very good Friend) But before the King's Anſwer came from <hi>Flanders, Dalleval</hi> received a Letter from the Earl of <hi>Melfort,</hi> requiring his Return immediately to St. <hi>Germains;</hi> which Letter he ſhewed me, and I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to the Queen, who knowing <hi>Melfort</hi>'s Hand, gave Orders, That Colonel <hi>Dalleval</hi> might go for <hi>France</hi> again, provided, that he engaged to Return when Her Majeſty required him: All which he Swore, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed moſt Solemnly to do, and then went for <hi>France</hi> accordingly: Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Arrival there, he ſent me ſeveral Letters writ in Characters, promiſing to come to King <hi>William</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and deſired me to meet him there. The Arch-Biſhop and my ſelf from time to time, acquainted Her Majeſty of every Particular; and I was Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go for <hi>Flanders,</hi> where I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with the King Three Months on
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94786:20"/>
this Occaſion, and Receiv'd Letters from Colonel <hi>Dellaval</hi> at St. <hi>Germains</hi> Twice every Week, during the time I was there; the Contents of which Letters prov'd very true, and of ſome Uſe at that time to the King's Affairs; but this was only a Snare, the more ſecurely to Ruin me to the Purpoſe: For, as ſoon as the King came to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Parliament was Sitting, <hi>Dellaval</hi> writ to me, and Mr. <hi>Hayes</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to have me get their Pardon, and Protection from the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, promiſing they wou'd make great Diſcoveries, (which His Majeſty knew they might, this being the Winter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Second intended Invaſion, when the Forces with the late King <hi>James</hi> lay at <hi>La Hogue,</hi> ready to Embark the latter end of <hi>April</hi> following) the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament having Addreſſed the King, to cauſe the Lord <hi>Preſton</hi>'s, and Mr. <hi>Crone</hi>'s Confeſſions to be laid before them; and theirs agreeing with mine, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made an humble Addreſs to the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94786:21"/>
King, to add to his Bounty to me; this did more inflame Mine, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Enemies; and Colonel <hi>Dellaval</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hayes</hi> ſent me abundance of Letters, and great Promiſes of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſiderable Services for Their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties, and this Kingdom's Safety. At length I did Addreſs the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> in their Behalf, Deſiring a Pardon and Paſsport to be given me Blank, for Two Gentlemen to come from beyond the Seas, and to Return if deſired: The Honourable Honſe granted my Requeſt, on Condition I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for their Appearance, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what they promiſed at this time: Only their Majeſties, and ſome of Their Moſt Honourable Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil knew theſe Mens Names that I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for, leſt the <hi>French</hi> Court ſhou'd prevent their Coming, (as my Credulity caus'd me to believe) I had the Protection of the Parliament for them, and a Pardon and Paſsport Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aed by the King, and under the Great
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94786:21"/>
Seal; it was left blank for me to fill up; and this I ſent for <hi>Flanders,</hi> by a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of my own, Recommended by ſome Members of Parliament: It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving very cold hard Weather in thoſe Parts, <hi>Dellaval</hi> and <hi>Hayes</hi> came to <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> ſome time before my Meſſenger cou'd get there; ſo they went to <hi>Oſtend,</hi> and came from thence to <hi>England,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard their Pardon had paſſed the Seals. The Meſſenger heard of them at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and other Places; and hearing they were come for <hi>England,</hi> he returned: As ſoon as <hi>Dellaval</hi> and the other arrived, they ſent one <hi>Jones</hi> to me with a Letter, aſſuring me, they were coming to Town, and intended to Attend on the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> the <hi>Monday</hi> following. I was extream joyful to hear of their Arrival, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent their Letter to the Houſe, where the <hi>Speaker</hi> Read it; and <hi>Monday</hi> was appointed for Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. At this Unhappy Time I was very dangerouſly Sick, and when
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94786:22"/>
               <hi>Monday</hi> came, the Gentlemen were ſeen by many in the <hi>Lobby,</hi> whilſt the Houſe was at Prayers: But Prayers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, and they call'd for, they were vaniſhed of a ſudden, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the Houſe to appoint a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to come to me, which they did, taking all my Papers, and Informations on Oath; <hi>Anthony Bowyer,</hi> Eſquire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chair-man of the ſaid Committee I gave them an Account where Mr. <hi>Hayes</hi> had lodged formerly at a Papiſts in <hi>Holborn,</hi> but they were not to be ſound; which occaſion'd on <hi>Wedn'ſday</hi> the Twenty Fourth of <hi>February</hi> to paſs a Vote againſt me, and to addreſs the King to order the <hi>Attorney-General</hi> to proſecute me for engaging for theſe Men, and that they did not appear: Now King <hi>James</hi>'s Friends had their Deſire, and <hi>Dellaval,</hi> with the Other, having accompliſht their Villanous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, return'd for <hi>France:</hi> I was brought to my Tryal, at my own Requeſt, at the <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94786:22"/>
even then theſe Gentlemen, <hi>Dellaval,</hi> and <hi>Hayes,</hi> ſent me ſeveral Letters to excuſe themſelves, and promiſed to come and Vindicate me: And it is moſt certain, That even to this time, they have continued to come frequently to <hi>England</hi> about King <hi>James</hi>'s Buſineſs: When I was on my Tryal, the <hi>Attorney-General,</hi> now <hi>Lord-Keeper</hi> of the <hi>Great Seal,</hi> and one of the Lords Juſtices of <hi>England,</hi> told the Judges and Jury, That I had performed very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Services to the Advantage and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Preſent Government, and had diſcharg'd my Duty honeſtly; but having Engag'd for thoſe Men, and they not Appearing, occaſioned my Tryal; on which I produced a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, under the Hand of His Grace the Duke of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> that by the King's Order, and his Encouragement, I was ſent to <hi>France</hi> for the Service and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Preſent Government, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:94786:23"/>I alſo deſired the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice Holt</hi> to acquaint the Jury, (who were all Gentlemen of good Account) of what he knew, being one of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's moſt honourable Privy-Council. And, as to the Matter relating to the Letters I had, and the Pardons, and Money which was offered me to go back for <hi>France,</hi> all which his Lordſhip moſt juſtly and honourably declared: There was likewiſe a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Members of Parliament call'd; but the Men I engaged for, not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Houſe, to certifie them, I was found Guilty of a Miſdemeanour againſt them.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſhewed how far their Malice extended to me, I beg you will take Notice, how Confidently King <hi>James</hi>'s Friends can oppoſe any Truth that is againſt their Intereſt, as now their denying that the <hi>French</hi> Court, or King <hi>James</hi>'s knew, of the Deſign of Murthering King <hi>William;</hi> when the World cannot but remember that <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier</hi>

               <hi>Granval</hi> was Executed in <hi>Flanders,</hi> for Endeavouring to Shoot the KING; and that, at his Death, he Confeſs'd the Fact: And it was ſufficiently prov'd, That Colonel <hi>Parker</hi> was engag'd with him; and that <hi>Parker</hi> had Receiv'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from the Late King; and that both of Them, with Others, were En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from Time to Time, by the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters of State: Of This I firſt acquainted his Majeſty, but it was further Diſcover'd at one of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate</hi> Prince's Courts; who earneſtly preſſed his Majeſty to Examine the Matter; and, being done, this <hi>Granval</hi> was found Guilty, and Executed; tho' Colonel <hi>Parker</hi> made his Eſcape: Which may convince any thinking Man, that from the Firſt Intended Invaſion from <hi>France,</hi> that Court has ſtudied Wayes to Kill King <hi>William,</hi> and his late Royal Conſort, of ever Bleſſed Memory.</p>
            <p>As for the Intolerable Injuries that I have undergone, Time, and their own

Devices have at laſt Demonſtrated, tho they ſpared for no Means, that might make me Obnoxious to all Good Men: <hi>I bleſs God, and muſt acknowledge the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Goodneſs of my Sovereign, for my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from their treacherous and baſe Villanies; and earneſtly pray, that Almighty God will forgive them, as I moſt freely do.</hi>

blaſt the whole Credit of all I had ſaid, or could ſay; ſo to expoſe the King to their own Impious Conſpiracies, by ſtifling whatever Truth ſhould pretend to ſpeak, for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Deliverance.</p>
               <p>And, as to the 'Veracity of my Informations and Depoſitions, though render'd by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Miſrepreſentations ſo diſcredited by the Government, the happy Detection of the late horrid Plot has fully and amply clear'd the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Aſperſions and falſe Imputations againſt me, when their Deſigns are ſo manifeſtly proved to be built upon the ſame Bottom, and managed by the very ſame Perſons; the ſame Conſpiring hands I then Diſcovered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
