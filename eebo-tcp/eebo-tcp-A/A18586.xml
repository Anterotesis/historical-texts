            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in her Chamber, and sitting v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pona low stoole, preparing her selfe to bedward: the Ferrit standing with his hinder legs vpon the ground, and his fore legs setled vpon her lappe, and setling his fiery eyes vpon her eyes, spake and pronounced vnto her these woords follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, namelye: Ioan Prentice giue me thy soule, to whome this Examinate being greatly amazed, answered and said: In the name of god what art thou The Ferrit answered, I am satan, feare me not mycomming vnto thee is to doo thee no hurt but to obtaine thy soule, which I must and wil haue before I departe from thee to whome the saide examinate answered and said, that he demaunded that of her which is none of hers to giue, saying: that her soule appertained onely vnto Iesus Christ, by whose precious blood shedding, it was bought and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. To whomethe saide Ferret replyed and saide, I must then haue some of thy blood, which she willingly graunting, offered him the forefinger of her left hand, the which the Ferrit tooke into his mouth, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his former feete vpon that hand, suckt blood ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, in so much that her finger did smart exceedingye: and the saide examinate demaunding againe of the Ferrit what his name was: It answered Bidd. and then presently the said Ferrit vanished out of her sight sodainly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:19911:6"/>Item, the saide examinate saith further, that about one moneth after, the saide Ferrit came againe vnto her in the night time as she was sitting vpon a little stoole, preparing her selfe to bed-ward, as is aboue saide: Ioan wilt thou goe to bed, to whome she an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered yea that I will by Gods grace, then presently the Ferret leapt vp vpon her lap, and from thence vp to her bosome, and laying his former feete vpon her lefte shoulder, sucked blood out of her lefte cheeke, and then he saide vnto her, Ioan if thou will haue me doo any thing for thee, I am and wilbe alwaies ready at thy commaundement, and ther-upon she beeing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before fallen out with William Adams his wife of <hi>Hinningham Sibble</hi> aforesaide: willed the Ferret to spoile her drinke which was then in brewing, which he did accordingly.</p>
            <p>Item, the saide examinate furthermore saith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, that the saide Ferret diuers times after appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto her alwaies at the time when she was going to bed, and the last time he appeered vnto her was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout seauen weekes last past, at which time she going to bed, the Ferrit leapt vpon her left shoulder, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked blood out of her lefte cheeke, and that doone: he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of her what she had for him to doo? To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she answered, goe vnto Maister Glascocks house, and nippe one of his Children a little, named Sara, but hurt it not, and the next night he resorted vnto her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and told her that he had doon as she willed him: namely, that he had nipt Sara Glascock, and that she should dye therof, to whome she answered and saide, thou villaine what hast thou doon, I bid thee to nip it but a little and not to hurt it, and hast thou killed the

childe? which speech beeing vttered, the Ferrit vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed away suddenly, and neuer came to her sithence.</p>
            <p>Item, she affirmeth, that the occasion why she did will her Ferret to nippe the saide childe, was for that she beeing the daye before at the house of the saide Maister Glascok, to begge his almes, answere was made to her by one of his maiden seruantes, that both her Maister and Mistres were from home, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desired her to be contented for that time, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the examinate departed greatlye discontented, and that night sent her Ferret to nip the childe as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouesaide.</p>
            <p>Item, she saith and affirmeth, that at what time so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer she would haue her Ferret doo any thing for her, she vsed these woordes, Bidd, Bidd, Bidd, come Bidd, come bidd, come bidd, come suck, come suck, come suck, and that presently he would appeere as is aforesaide: and suckt blood out of her left cheeke, and thenperfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med any mischeefe she willed or wished him to doo for her vnto or against any of her neighbours.</p>
            <p>Lastly the said examinate saith, and confesseth, that one Elizabeth Whale, the wife of Michaell Whale of Henningham Sibble aforesaide labourer, and Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Mott, the wife of Iohn Mot of the saide Towne Cobler, are as well acquainted with her Bidd as her selfe is, but knoweth not what hurt they or any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue doone to any of their neighbours.</p>
            <p>WHen their inditements were read, and their exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations also, they stoode vpon their tearmes, to prolong life: yet to make the matters more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, sundry witnesses were produced to giue euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce

<pb facs="tcp:19911:7"/>
against them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and firste the Iudge of the circuite very wisely with a great foresight, called in the two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterd Children before mencioned, and contended them greatlye for telling the trueth of that which he should aske them, concerning their Grandam and their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which they did, and hauing saide what they could, together with the depositions of sundrye other witnesses, they hauing confessed sufficient matter to proue the inditements. The Iury found these bad wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men guiltie and that they had slaine Men, women, and Children, And committed very wicked and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions, diuers and sundrye times, and ther-upon, the Iudge proceeded, and pronounced the sentence of death against them, as worthely they had deserued.</p>
            <p>After they had receiued their iudgments, they were conuayed from the Barre backe againe to Prison, where they had not stayed aboue two howers, but the officers prepared them-selues to conduct them to the place of execution: to which place they led them, and being come thether, one Maister Ward a learned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, beeing desired by the Iustices, did exhorte these wicked women to repentance, And perswaded them that they would shewe vnto the people the trueth of their wickednes, and to call vpon God for mercy with penitent hartes. And to aske pardon at his hands for the same: some fewe prayers they saide after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, but little els: more then this, that they had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to dye, in committing those wicked sinnes: and so tooke their deathes patiently.</p>

               <hi>Note,</hi> that Mother Upney being inwardlye pricked and hauing some inward feeling in conscience cryed out saying: that she had greeuously sinned, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

had deceiued her, the deuill had deceiued her, and that she had twice giuen her soule to the Deuill, yet by the meanes of Gods spirite woorking in her, and the paines which Maister ward tooke with her, she seemed very sorry for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, and died very penitent, asking God &amp; the world for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes, euen to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> last gaspe, for her wicked and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable life.</p>
