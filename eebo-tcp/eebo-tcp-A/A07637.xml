            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ine honoured Lord, I here preſent vnto your view, nor Comedie, nor Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as wanting firſt the iuſt number of Speakers: Secondarily, thoſe parts or Acts it ſhould haue, which ſhould bee at the leaſt fiue; but a plaine Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue or conference between ſo many perſons, conſiſting of three Acts, and no more. If there be any Act in it, to make it ſauour in your Lordſhippes pallate, I ſhall be glad: Wormewood or gall to make it diſtaſtefull, I am ſure there is none, if rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: for howſoeuer I may by chaunce light vpon a galled place, my entent is not to rubbe it ſo hard, to grieue it or make it worſe: but rather to wipe it ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to clenſe it, and heale it.</p>
            <p>If any man thinkes himſelfe touched in any thing
<pb facs="tcp:1552:3"/>
that is amiſſe, let him endeauour by Gods helpe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it; and if there be any good counſell in it, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reformation of manners, or other aduice, as I dare be bold to ſay, there eyther is, or ſhould be; let him make vſe of that, and follow it.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, my very good Lord, as in all actions done, or to be done, after what kind ſoeuer, there be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall reaſons, if grounded vpon reaſon or iudgement: why, or to what end they are, or ſhould be done, ſo in this committed to your Lordſhips hands, though ſoone conceiued, and as ſoone brought into the world, being not aboue ſixeteene dayes labour therein, more aimed at then the verball ſence: Which if it pleaſe your Lordſhip, giue me leaue to giue you ſome inſtructions, is thus to be taken.</p>
            <p>In the perſon of the old Gentleman is figured forth a man of ſingular good education, life &amp; conuerſation, a man that had ſeene the World, taſted the ſorrowes and troubles of this life with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and towardes the end of his dayes had a peacefull poſſeſſion of an happy eſtate giuen him: wherein alſo is ſet out the benefit of contentation: A man truly vertuous, frugall, bounteous and liberall, a louer of good company and hoſpitality, deſirous to gaine the good will of his neighbours.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, are ſhewed the wonderfull preſeruation and bleſſings that God beſtoweth on them that ſerue him: firſt, his wife a good wife; then his children, as a principall bleſſing, next, good children, and his care in their education, beſides his temporall bleſſings.</p>
            <p>In the perſon of his wife is ſet out a vertuous, chaſte and ſober Matron, one that was carefull of her charge,
<pb facs="tcp:1552:3"/>
not a gadding houſwife, but ſuch an one as did ſpende her idle times in reading hiſtories and other good bookes, as is eaſie to bee perceyued. In them both the happieſt vnion, and agreement that ſhould bee in that bleſſed eſtate of marriage: and laſtly, in them two, the prayſe of a country life.</p>
            <p>In the perſon of their ſon is ſet out an hopefull yong Gentleman, whoſe father had a great care to ſee him well brought vp according to his eſtate, and to let him know the world betimes; not to keepe him at home vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his noſe, as many too kind and fooliſh parentes vſe to doe, vntill they haue marde their children, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe might haue beene better. Secondly, in him is ſhewed how a young man ſhould carry himſelfe; firſt, to ſerue God, to pleaſe his parents, to follow that which is good, to reade good bookes, and to make choiſe of his company.</p>
            <p>In the perſon of the Merchant, the nobleſt profeſſion of Trade; from whom diuers Worſhipfull houſes in <hi>England</hi> haue had their originall, is ſet out in ſome part their diſpoſition, who being for the moſt parte excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rich, are alſo exceeding miſerable, till they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to get out &amp; warm their blouds with this element of good liquor, and then as farre exceed in ſuperfluity, as by experience I haue knowne ſome.</p>
            <p>In the Serieant is ſet out, a well-deſeruing ſouldier, who ſticking in the firſt place of preferment, can get no higher.</p>
            <p>In the Sentinell, an honeſt priuate ſouldier, one that loues a potte better then a Wench, and indeed the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſpoſition of all Souldiers, who for the moſt part
<pb facs="tcp:1552:4"/>
leade a merry life, careleſſe of any thing, ſo they may in a reaſonable meaſure be prouided for of meate, drinke, and apparrell.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Beerepot</hi> is ſet out an honeſt ſeruant, who howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, he will keepe company, and be merry ſometimes, yet nothing can draw him from the performance of his buſineſſe, and the due reſpect of his ſeruice, and duty to his maſter.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Flutterkin,</hi> a Marchant of good Beere, a merry companion, one that will giue content to his gueſts, ſet out his wares, and helpe to vtter them himſelfe, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then no body ſhould be drunke, he will make one.</p>
            <p>In the Moore, a man that had taſted the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of Fortune, one that bare his croſſes brauely and ſtoutly, and in deſpight of Forune, would bee merrie, and ſing while others wept.</p>
            <p>And for the names which are ſignificant, if you take them according to their Dialect, as leſſe materiall, I leaue your Lordſhip, at your leaſure to gueſſe at: and commending my ſelfe, and thoſe my poore endeuours vnto your Lordſhips Honourable patronage.
