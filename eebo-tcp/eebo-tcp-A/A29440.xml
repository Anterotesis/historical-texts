            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>HOw now M. <hi>Caco-zeal,</hi> what is the reaſon
you came no ſooner, ſeeing I ſent for you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Zeal.</speaker>
               <p>In truth Sir, I was ſo buſied in pulling
down Cheap-ſide Croſſe, and preparing my
Journey for Amſterſtam, I could make no more haſte.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>What for Amſterdam, I think now the Spirit
bloweth where it liſteth? what Newes I pray you in
<hi>England,</hi> you muſt need go that pilgrimage: hath your
Zeal bin ſo fervent that ye have ſet England on fire, and
in a mutiny, that now it is grown to hote for you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Zeal.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt confeſſe, that our Zeal was hote, ſo that
we ſet them all in an uprore: but to tell you in a truly
the ſhepheard is ſmitten, and the flock is ſcattered, our
old Prophet Samuell How is dead; but I thank my God
that many more are riſen, but muſt not be allowed to
pray <hi>ex tempore,</hi> no not to pray at all without a ſet Form
and Order (Order ſay I) I cry the Lord hearty mercy
for preſenting that word, it is a ſlip in me, the Lord will
not ſuffer his beſt ſervants to fall, we uſe no order but in

more preciſe in our actions, not communicating with
Publicans and Sinners, neither diſtrubuting to the poor
nor any other. But cleaving cloſe unto a holy brother
neither viſiting the ſick; for it is quite contrary to our
Diſcipline and Form of teaching, we have ſcarce ſo much
time as to get our dinners at home, nay our breakfaſts,
we are ſo early: for I muſt tell you the ſpirit moveth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

               <p>But J muſt tell you the ſpirit is upon us, and
