            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> Brief Directions To the READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et me obtain (loving Reader) this favour, that you take notice of theſe few Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the peruſal of this little Book.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169411:4"/>
Firſt, that the main Rule of my thoughts in the compiling hereof, hath been Experience; I ſay, The Experience out of divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars diligently (according to my poor skill) compriſed together into one. And truely if, according to the Philoſopher, <hi>Experientia est op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima Magiſtra,</hi> Eperience be our beſt Teacher, as alſo a chief guide in all our Divinity; doubtleſſe it is worth the labour ſeriouſly to mark it. Yet ſince that what I have written is not the Experience of all men, but of ſome (for who is able to finde out all the ſecreſie of but one heart, much more of all hearts?) let it not, I pray, by any means of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you, if you chance to meet with that thing which concurs not with the Experience and Motion
<pb facs="tcp:169411:4"/>
of your own ſoul; for I intend nothing herein as a poſitive Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or an abſolute Rule: if any thing be generally true in all or moſt men, be it ſo; if not in thoſe things which are ſtrange to your ſoul, let your Diſcretion be your better Direction: for you muſt conſider, that like an Anatomiſt I have cut up as well the Breſt as the Head, and as well the Belly as the Breſt: I have equally let out the foul and deformed parts that are in Man or Mankinde, as well as the fairer and better parts: Here is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſomewhat of all ſorts of men, and again ſomething per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance which diſagrees with moſt men.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for my expreſſions, I have endeavoured to declare every
<pb facs="tcp:169411:5"/>
particular herein in the fitteſt and moſt naturally-agreeing terms (as neer as I could) according to the lively ſenſe of the Truth, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a congruity of ſpeech to be the beſt eloquence; ſhattering in alſo now and then an expreſſion in Verſe, to the end the ſerious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your minde may the more pleaſantly run on in reading: for though my poor and humble Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes adde perhaps but little orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the matter, yet ſince they do not at all interrupt the ſenſe nor your thoughts with any long Parentheſis, my hope is they may be delightful in their variety, though they be not in their elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And whereas again I have caſt my words into a ſympathetical and fellow-feeling Mould, the
<pb facs="tcp:169411:5"/>
cauſe is, Partly for that mine own experience gives me good reaſon for it; and partly again, for that I conceive, <hi>Nihil humanani à me alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> No humane thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Mankinde to be ſo ſtrange unto me, but that I may fitly ſympathize and ſenſibly concur with it. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>all things unto all men; to the Jews, a Jew; to the Gentiles, a Gentile; to the ſinners, a ſinner,</hi> that he might work the more effect and comfort in all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhal earneſtly deſire, if your time and ability may conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſerve, that you will adde your own Experimental Obſervations hereunto, to the encreaſing of this poor Book (if God ſhall ſo give
<pb facs="tcp:169411:6"/>
his bleſſing) into a larger Volume: for I could heartily wiſh that lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men would ſtudie Themſelves as well as their Books; would more ſet forward in communicating their Experience, I ſay, the real Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their Hearts, rather then the Imaginary notions of their Brains, to the publike uſe, for comfort and encreaſe of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge unto others.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, whereas I have laboured very much for Brevity, knitting up all things ſhort and cloſe together, to the end I might not be tedious unto you; ſo that it may be <hi>dum brevis eſſe labore obſcurus fio,</hi> whileſt that I ſtrive to be brief, I become obſcure, and the more dark to the apprehenſion of him that readeth:
<pb facs="tcp:169411:6"/>
My humble Requeſt therefore is, that you would beſtowe, if not a repetition, at leaſtwiſe the more heed and deliberation in reading: and as <hi>Eliſha</hi> did in reviving the Widows Childe, ſo let me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to take this little Book up into your Chamber or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Room, to ſpread it before you, and to ſtretch your ſelf upon it, to apply the inner ſhape and proportion of your hearts unto it; and ſo by your Prayers unto God, to deſire that you may finde a ſoul and life in the reading of it, that it may ſo animate in you, that it be not as a dead and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether-unprofitable thing, which I alſo ſhall ever pray for to the utmoſt of my power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169411:7"/>
And thus for the preſent I take my leave, remaining</p>

               <p>As we are raiſed up, I may ſay with Saint <hi>Paul, unto</hi> this <hi>third heaven,</hi> this more then thrice happie Condition of Joy; ſo is there alſo given us our fatal portion of miſery, <hi>a thorn in the fleſh;</hi> a thorn of ſin which doth as ſhrewdly prick us with ſorrow, as ever we were tickled with delight; the ſowrneſſe of <hi>Eve</hi>'s apple will not be put out of our taſte: be we never ſo ſpiritual, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſubject unto ſin: I ſay ſin, and I may ſay ſins too; ſin, as intimating onely ſome ſpecial ones, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; and ſins, as denoting a multiplicity of them in the general: for as for many of us, peradventure we are more indifferently prone and ſubject unto all kindes and ſorts of iniquity: there is almoſt no ſin, no perverſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and impiety, but that we have a ſtrong taſte there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in our ſouls: But moſt of us, I ſay moſt of us in particular, are troubled with ſome pricking ſin, ſome thorn or other above the reſt, ſome naturally-enclin'd enormity of our inner man; and theſe, theſe darling and intimate ſins of ours, whatſoever they be, do always, as we may obſerve, in an eminent manner cry down the reſt, do with more violence haunt us, and with more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency overwhelm us; ſo that we ſhall hardly long be free from them. Ordinary and weakly diſpoſed ſins may perhaps be ſwallowed down with eaſe; but theſe extraordinary and deep-rooted ones do ſtick cloſe and faſt in the Conſcience: our other ſins for the moſt part we may pretty well digeſt in oblivion; but this ſin, this our familiar and boſom-ſin, is ſo hearty a ſin, always with ſo full a deſire, and therefore ſo palpably groſſe to our apprehenſion, that it conſtantly leaves behinde it a

Memento of ſhame to our outward man, and the ſting of ſadneſſe to our inner ſoul. When it is paſt and gone, we ſhall finde our Conſciences wounded with diſmayedneſſe, and our hearts drooping with grief; ſuch ſowre ſauce hath this ſeeming pleaſure; ſuch a ſting in the tail hath this flattering Serpent; a ſting it is which, as I ſay, without queſtion we are ſufficiently ſenſible of; we can moſt duely and tenderly feel the hurt it doth us; and yet for all that, when it comes too, it doth ſo ſtrongly charm and bewitch our reaſon, that all the power that is in us is preſently diſſolved, and we are no way able to withſtand it: the deceitful bait of pleaſure maketh us ſuddenly to ſwallow down the Bane, and then, though like that Book in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> it be <hi>ſweet in the mouth</hi> to commit it, yet is it <hi>bitter in the belly,</hi> exceeding bitter, even as Wormwood: See <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 4. Sin doth us no great harm whilſt we look to it in time: though it bring with it a ſadneſſe and a ſting unto our Conſciences; yet as long as within three or four days, or a week, we do vent out this ſadneſſe into tears, with true Compunction, and pull out again this ſting by the hand of Repentance, we feel no danger unto our ſelves. When we are in ſin, our underſtanding is as it were in a cloud, and our affections cold and dull; but the return of Gods favour again, will appear unto us as the Sun diſperſing with his brightneſſe the clouds of ignorance, and enflaming with his heat the coldneſſe of affection: ſo true finde we that which our Saviour ſpeaks of himſelf in Saint <hi>John: I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſſe, but ſhall have the light of life. In darkneſſe,</hi> that is, the darkneſſe of ſin: <hi>but ſhall have the light of life,</hi> that is, that living light which quickens the heart unto goodneſſe, and enliveneth the affections.

In the act of Repentance, we ſhall as it were throw down our ſelves before God with a filial remorſe and melting ſorrow for our offence, ſomtimes caſting an eye upon the exceeding vileneſſe of our ſin, and then weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and grieving, and vexing our ſelves, that we ſhould be creatures ſo wretched as to commit that, which, though there were no God to obey, not Law to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, yet a man would be aſhamed and ſcorn to do: ſomtimes caſting an eye to conſider, not ſo much what it is in it ſelf, as againſt whom; and then it is ten times grief, to think that we ſhould ſo highly offend him that hath always been ſo good, ſo loving, and, as I may ſay ſo, too much merciful unto us; that we ſhould diſpleaſe him whoſe infinite goodneſſe is more then that we are able in the leaſt degree to deſerve, though we ſhould with all the veins of our hearts continually obey him; counting it a moſt tender thing to grieve him which hath vouchſafed us to be as dear unto himſelf as the very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his eye.</p>
               <p>We ſhall, I ſay, weep, and grieve, and vex our ſelves: for it is to be noted, that we do ſeldom finde the true and effectual comfort of Repentance without tears: when the eye can kindly run down with ſtreams of water, then doth our heart begin to feel eaſe, then doth that burden begin to be light, which before was ſo heavie; and then will the light of grace begin to ſhine in upon our ſouls, and kindle our affections with that zeal of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 86. 11. <hi>O knit my ſoul, knit it faſter unto thee, that I may fear thy Name.</hi> Many times thus in the paſſion of our ſouls are we ſo overjoyed, as it were, at the return of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that we could even ſuffer our hearts to be pluckt out of our breaſts to offer them up in devotion unto him: and therefore now do we lift up our ſouls with ſuch a ſervent deſire of better obedience, that hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth it ſeemeth not enough for us to go or walk, but we muſt <hi>run the way of thy Commandments, O Lord, ſince thou <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>To hang down the head like a bulruſh,</hi> Iſai. 58. 8, and to be covered with the ſackcloth of dejection for our ſins, this verily is not the main; this is but the outſide and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Repentance:</p>
               <lg>

               </lg>
               <p>A lively reſolution of the heart to redeem the time, this is the ſoul and reality thereof. Repentance is but dead, without a lively heart: and ſurely it never doeth us good, till it thus come unto the quick.</p>
               <p>Well now, when the Almighty hath thus breathed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſouls this breath of life, then doth our hope revive again in the confidence of pardon, and then alſo ſhall we be ſo ſenſibly affected with Gods infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards us, that theſe his mercies, like thoſe <hi>bands of love,</hi> Hoſ. 11. 4, do tye us far more to his obedience then before; all the faculties of both body &amp; ſoul do ſeem too little for us to do him ſervice with, that ſo in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure we may requite his love in forgiving, by our love in obeying; the more God forgives us, the more we do always love him: ſo that we may juſtly witneſſe the truth of that which our Saviour ſaith, <hi>To whom God hath forgiven much, he will love him much.</hi> This love of God doth uſually raiſe in us a holy indignation againſt ſin, to hate, to abhor, and as it were trample it under our feet, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us zealouſly to take part with God againſt our ſelves, who have thus took part with ſin againſt God; and therefore ſhall we be ready to enjoyn a kinde of penance to our ſouls, and to execute in Gods behalf a revenge upon our ſelves, ſo that if it were poſſible, we might give him a due recompence and ſatisfaction for our offence.</p>
               <p>The effect of Repentance is, That we ſhall feel our conſciences ſatisfied, our hearts at reſt, and our ſelves joyfully at one with God again; and then will our ſoul make her boaſt of the Lord, that <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, the Service of God leads us into that glorious liberty (which as I conceive Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of) <hi>of the ſons of God.</hi> Firſt, I mean that liberty whereby we feel our Conſciences ſet free from the doting ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſity of things unneceſſary and indifferent, the which perchance at ſome other times we may be apt to ſtick upon with perplexity. Secondly, I mean that liberty, we may call it The liberty of Obedience, which as it makes us willingly and freely to obey our betters, cauſe 'tis for Gods glory, who hath appointed the ſame, and 'cauſe 'tis for his glory to do him ſervice in it: ſo again it makes us ſo free in Spirit as not to ſtoop to any igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or diſgraceful ſervility; that is, with a baſe and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly heart to yeeld our approbation in any unjuſt &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct courſe, becauſe our Superiours either like or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it; to <hi>call good evil,</hi> or <hi>evil good,</hi> for any cauſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: No, we have a warrant for it methinks in our ſouls, not to deny the Truth for the fear or love of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt or deareſt one in the world: for if we deny the Truth, we deny him that is greater and dearer unto us then any can be beſides, even God himſelf; for <hi>God is Truth,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>John:</hi> And ſurely he that is in ſubjection to <hi>father or mother,</hi> as our Saviour ſaith, or even unto any other
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169411:15"/>
Creature, more then unto God, <hi>is not worthy of</hi> him. Many times this free ſpirit is apt to degenerate into a firy ſpirit; ſo that in ſtead of a moderate uſe of the liberty of truth towards Superiours, ſhall we be ready to fall into a raſh and diſobedient humour againſt them. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi>'s dealing with King <hi>David,</hi> 1 Chron. 21. 3, is a ſingular example to be followed in this kinde; that is, to be ſo freely faithful unto our Betters, as not to flatter or back them on in that which is evil; and yet <hi>(not uſing our Liberty as a cloke of Maliciouſneſſe)</hi> ſo lovingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful, as not to contradict their power with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet and churliſh impatiency. Moreover, this our foreſaid unity and reconciliation with God, crowneth our ſouls with many happie and rare advantages; but ſpecially in this, that it maketh our ſpirits chearful, merry and full of rejoycing: a good Conſcience is as <hi>a continual feaſt,</hi> wherein we are ſatisfied with all good things, <hi>as with marrow and fatneſſe;</hi> and therefore moſt fitly hath our Saviour named the holy Ghoſt a <hi>Comforter: And be ſhall give you another Comforter,</hi> Joh. 14. 16. A Comforter, and truely ſo: for how can ſadneſſe take faſt hold in that breſt where this heavenly joy and comfort doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide? Thus for a ſeaſon do we flouriſh in the ſtate of reconciliation, flouriſh like an herb nouriſhed with the dew of heaven, or <hi>like the tree,</hi> in <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, <hi>planted by the waters ſide,</hi> the flowing river of Gods mercies. And now</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>And now perchance that we have ſpent ſome days,</l>
                  <l>Or elſe ſome weeks in theſe more ſacred ways,</l>
               </lg>
               <p>we muſt begin to take an unwilling farewel of this our happineſſe: for by this time, that heart and courage againſt ſin which we have got by Repentance, doth flag, grow leſſe and leſſe and decay, till we are defiled therewith as before: the drowzie eye by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle falls aſleep it knows not how; and were it not for the awaking again, 'twould ſcarce perceive whether it had ſlept or no: ſo, even ſo, inſenſibly doth ſin creep

on, and ſo ſubtilly get within us, that we can never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt feel it, till the ſting thereof hath awaken our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences unto Repentance. And then again perceiving the wickedneſſe of our hearts, and the foul enormity of ſin, ſhall we in the bitterneſſe of our ſouls, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of our iniquities, humble our ſelves even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the duſt of the earth, accounting us not worthy to be the vileſt creatures under the cope of heaven, that have been ſo wickedly perfidious againſt our Creator; and therefore do we conſider and earneſtly reſolve for the preſent, if it will pleaſe him once more, even this once more to forgive us this our ſin; ſurely methinks all the devils in hell ſhould not prevail to overtake us ſo again: for this doth always touch us neereſt and trouble us moſt, that we are ſo faithleſſe unto God, and ſo full of hypocriſie before him, that whereas at our laſt Repentance we had ſo ſyncerely, ſo heartily and ſo ſeriouſly promiſed amendment of life, and alſo with our whole might and main to obey God and pleaſe him; nevertheleſſe, though our promiſe doth ſeem to be never ſo hearty, and with ſo full a purpoſe, yet the end and event doth ſhew that there is hypocriſie in it, even great hypocriſie: for when temptation comes, and ſin is at hand, then do we falſheartedly and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, not onely not duly ſtrive againſt and reſiſt it, but even baſely yeeld unto it: So infirm is our beſt ability, that our Saviour hath wiſely taught us to pray to God that he would not try our ſtrength with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation; <hi>O lead us not into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

farther beſides this hugging and haſtie embracing of the evil motions of ſin propoſed unto us: I ſay, One degree farther, even by ſeeking after temptation and inviting of outward means to beget ſin within us; juſt as thoſe of whom <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>that draw iniquity with cords of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſin as it were with a cart-rope.</hi> Well, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</p>

                  <l>Though ſin doth thus even dye our ſouls in grain,</l>
                  <l>Thy mercies, Lord, can purge out all the ſtain.</l>

                  <l>But all our hope is in thy ſaving grace.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>notwithſtanding, I ſay, the unhappie diſcouragements of ſin, we ſhall embolden our ſelves to offer up in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner our reſolution unto the Lord. <hi>O merciful Father, if it would pleaſe thee to paſſe by our iniquities, and to forgive us this time, ſure now in good earneſt we will perform our words; we will certainly keep our promiſe, and ſet our ſelves more ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to it then before: hitherto we have promiſed well, but now will we do well; knowing verily, that it is not the ſudden paſſion of a good deſire that is ſufficient, but the conſtant habit of better Obedience: it is not enough to have the ſhew of godlineſſe in our Mouthes and bare Intentions, if we deny the true power and effect thereof in our Lives and Converſations. We will now therefore act out our intendment in the practice of Religion: whatſoever hath been paſt, we will now certainly be altogether in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; there ſhall nothing hinder us.</hi> Thus, even thus, ſo eager, ſo intentive, and ſo earneſt ſhall we be ſomtimes, that we deſire forgiveneſſe from God on no other terms, but as he doth finde our amendment afterwards: we will even be dealt withal according to our good beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and not onely ſo, but we ſhall be ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate a revenge of our breach of promiſe with ſome due puniſhment upon our heads, and to expect from God no otherwiſe to be merciful unto us then as that we do approve our faithfulneſſe unto him.</p>
               <p>And yet for all this, this utmoſt reſolution that may be, are we at no time as good as our word; I ſay, At

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf would fain be delivered, but it was anſwered him, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> Again, another cauſe may be, for that perchance we do attribute too much to our own ſtrength for the deliverance; and therefore God will let us ſee how weak we are of our ſelves to do any thing as of our ſelves.

We may take notice in our ſoules experience, that the proſperous ſucceſſe of religion, and the long uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted continuance of grace within us; as it maketh us bold with God thorough his mercies; ſo it maketh us alſo humble; bold I ſay, not proud; although nature bee very frequently apt and endeavouring in us to take too much upon her, and to miſtake Gods gifts and graces for her own proper powers faculties &amp; endowments; as bold, ſo I ſay again, it maketh us humble in our own ſelvs and weakneſſe; ſuch is the amiable brightneſſe of the divine Eſſence, that the more wee apprehend the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteneſſe, and purity thereof, the more wee ſeem in our ſelves to admire, to want and to thriſt after it, and even with unſatiable love to deſire perfection for this neerer apprehenſion of the Almighty, who giveth us light more clearely to ſee the groſneſſe, and obliquity of our own imperfections, whereby with humility we loath and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre what we are of our ſelves, ſo that our leaſt ſins in the time of grace ſeeme greater then our greateſt in the time of ſinne.

them again: As alſo that little praying, meditating, or reading which we do at any time now employ our ſelves in, doth altogether methinks paſſe away without any ſweetneſſe in't; it hath no more reliſh to us (for the moſt part) then even as it were a rotten ſtick, or a thing of nought; ſo ſuperficially doth it ſlip away on the outſide of our ſouls.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>In every thing, 'tis the delightful ſweet</l>
                  <l>Thereof, that doth with our affection meet.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>I ſay, It is the ſweetneſſe thereof that joyns it cloſely to the thoughts, and unites it to the affections; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe duties and the like being ſo out of reliſh with us, we have but little minde on them, we coldly regard them, and in a manner wholly neglect them; or if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure the faſhion of the times tend thereunto, and that we can ſmoothly ſtop up the mouth of truth-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conſcience with ſome daubing ſatisfaction: we may, I ſay, we may ſome of us retain the outſide, when we have loſt the inſide; we may ſeem to be delighted with an oral formality, when as it is no whit cordial within us; like unto ſhallow brooks that make a great noiſe with a little water; the ſhadow ſtill continuing with us, whilſt the ſubſtance is ſtollen away. But to go on in that way which is moſt uſual: I ſay, The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial deepneſſe of true inward pleaſure and delight in divine things being rooted up, pulls away with it the outward uſe of reading, meditating, and the like: ſo that we are ſeldom converſant in theſe things, although the liberty of our time give us opportunity for it never ſo conveniently: for it is to be noted, a truely willing minde can finde out ſhreds enough of time to beſtow in that way, even in the buſieſt and moſt induſtrious Calling. And as for that more excellent gift of the Spirit, Prayer, that Princely Diadem amongſt all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly graces, from whence all other divine bleſſings
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169411:30"/>
do borrow ſome luſtre and advantage; how far is the familiar acquaintance thereof gone from our ſouls? when as all our private devotion is now poſted off to the publike; and that alſo ſo ſlenderly and coldly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us, that the practice thereof is held on, it may be, rather for faſhion ſake then devotion; more with the motion of our lips then with the affection of the heart; following the publike exerciſe rather for fear of ſhame and reproach; I ſay, rather to keep touch and turn with the common Cuſtome, then out of any religious care or good will thereunto: for though the Sabbath be but once a week, yet ſhall we moſt times be then glad, if occaſion bee handſomly offer'd us to 'bide at home, and omit that duty.</p>

                  <l>It is too wet, or elſe it is too cold;</l>
                  <l>And we can pray even as well here as there:</l>

               <p>Again, as Prayer, ſo the Hearing of the Word is as much neglected by us, or as ill uſed, when we now ſit at Sermons, it is more perchance with a cenſorious ear, like Moderatours to give judgement, and paſſe our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, rather then as diligent Auditours, with humble hearts to receive inſtruction. If the Preacher doth but meanly perform his exerciſe, we are then ready to ſlight it, as a thing belowe us, and not worth our heeding: but if he go beyond us in his Learning and good parts, we are on the other ſide peradventure diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our ſelves, for that he exceedeth the reach of our capacity and qualification: for lo, we feel and finde as in this, ſo in all other things (it is worth obſervation) we finde, I ſay, that Nature is always ſo partial unto it ſelf, that it is never tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly pleaſed, and fully contented, except every

               <p>Every one, ſaith the Poet, thinks and talkes moſt of that which hee hath moſt to doe with, and doth moſt affect; and here nature principally begins to play her part, and ſhew her affection; our ſelfe accuſing, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient mind cannot abide the rehearfall of miſeries; unhappineſſe and affliction; the hideous newes of ſuch things is too rough for our tender thoughts to meddle with; whatever come of it hereafter, we muſt by all meanes put off for the preſent, as farre as may be from us that day of the Lord, and righteous retribution of his moſt juſt vengeance: againe, alſo the deadneſſe of heart maketh our ſoule to loath abhorre and leave off to hear and ſpeak of holy and pious ſubjects, as the diſpraiſe of vice, the commendation of vertue; the maner and means of Mortification; of Sanctification, of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and the like; ſnuffling away all ſuch matters
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169411:31"/>
if it be poſſible, into other diſcourſe: becauſe we feele our hearts ſo dead and rotten inward, that theſe things doe nothing elſe but ſecretly ſpeake the Condemnation and ſhame of our owne lives: and therefore when as out of the abundance of the heart (as ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) the mouth ſpeaketh, therefore I ſay on the other ſide, our thoughts being alwaye. for the moſt part vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outwardly diſpoſed; our delight is to be talking of vanity all the day long, to be asking after, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of newes, whereby to claw our idle phanſie with, or it may be queſtioning how rich others be, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they are in, how they doe thrive and the like; our Melancholy thoughts mainly labouring with emulation againſt others: and ſuch verily is alwayes the rivality and inward ſtriving betwixt equals, or thoſe that be neer equals in the ſame kind, that ſure I cannot thinke that it is a quality much leſſe then naturall unto all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſo to contend in affectation of deſire; this emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was there amongſt the Patriarks when they ſold <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and amongſt the Apoſtles when they vie'd who ſhould be the greateſt: and thus our minds being ſo wholly ſet on earthly things, and things of this world, it is ſeldome that we can thinke upon thoſe men that are in a little better proſperity then our ſelves, but with the eye of envious emulation, counting it as ſo much the worſe for us, and an eye-ſore to our ſtate and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they goe beyond us; and againe taking it as it were ſomewhat the better for us; and applauding our ſelves in content therewith, if they fall out and appeare to be ſomewhat under the condition that we our ſelves are in; thus as wee doe enviouſly thinke that too much which our ſucceſſefull neighbours have, and enjoy, and ſwell after their happineſſe with indignation at our owne; ſo alſo are we many times unhappy in our own happineſſe without any compariſon at all, or in reſpect of others; but meerly in our ſelves, and in regard of our owne bottomleſſe deſires, thinking all too little that

               <p>Nay farther, our apprehenſion is apt to be ſo ſubtilly deluded with this vice, that, as if avarice were a vertue, we ſhall be ready to think and ſay, of any one that is an hard and unreaſonably-neer man in his dealings and commerce with others, and that will ſtand out for the utmoſt farthing in every thing, though it be never ſo juſtly due and to be yeelded unto; of ſuch a one, I ſay, who hath cunningly learnt to oppreſſe the poor man by the advantage of his neceſſity, we ſhall be ready thus to think and ſay, <hi>I warrant he is wiſe enough, he will look to himſelf, he will not be fool'd of his goods;</hi> taking his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as a lawful patern for us to imitate.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169411:33"/>
or if it doth take any hold in us, it is very momentany &amp; of ſhort continuance obſcured quickly with the clouds of ſinne, and altogether forgotten; for let us know that Conſcience even in the freeſt and fulleſt purſuite of ſin is many times, ſo reall and urgent with us, that it will not be ſleighted, but either by excuſing our ſelves, by mitigating the nature of ſinne, by a ſeeming repentance, or the like, we muſt needs give it ſome content, though it be but as a meere duluſion for the time, and to no purpoſe at all; but I proſecute the patterne of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; in like manner as Melancholy joyned with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary privacy is wont to make good Meditations in the time of grace take the deeper root in nature; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it being united with a retired ſolitarineſſe maketh evill thoughts in the time of ſinne much more ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornely to perſiſt within us, cleaving a great deale the faſter to our apprehenſion, and fixing a farre ſore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in our ſoules.</p>

into it, and retains it longer then thoſe things which are of a rare and thin ſubſtance; for we always feel theſe ſolitary, theſe ſad and melancholy ſins of ours to be of a far deeper dye, and to wound our Conſciences more dangerouſly then thoſe other lighter kinde of ſins, thoſe merry, as I may ſo call them, and ſuperficial ſins: theſe ſad ones, I ſay, are worſe, becauſe they are moulded with deliberation in the heart, and come from a ſetled good-will and determinate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; but thoſe other, thoſe merry ones, are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the moſt part as ſudden flaſhes ariſing more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately, and paſſing away as a gueſt of one night.</p>
               <p>Well, to proceed in Anatomizing the particulars of this our now ſin-ſick ſoul: <hi>The wicked,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, fleeth when none purſueth him.</hi> An evil Conſcience having moved the foundation of our Spiritual comfort, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry buſh is a thief with us, every thing becomes our enemy, though not really, yet in conceit.

that all this while for the moſt part we do but fight with our own fancie, fearing where no fear is, and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving revenge where there is no cauſe of revenge: for at length having ſpoken with our adverſary, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded our ſelves together, we ſhall moſt times finde that he hath ſcarce had any the leaſt ill imagination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; and ſo by a true hearted diſcloſing our minde one to the other, we are perhaps eaſily undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and become friends again: whereas the muing up our ſelves from our enemy in a melancholy ſtrangeneſſe and ſquint-ey'd retire, might breed a continual and a deep Conſcience-wounding grudge betwixt us.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>So uncontented and ſo eagerly frappiſh are we apt to be, through the uneaſineſſe of the ſoul for want of true inward reſt and ſatisfaction; I ſay, ſo full of wrath, of paſſion and anger in all our thoughts, buſineſſes and affairs, that the leaſt and ſmalleſt occaſion, is enough to make us fret, chafe, aed be moſt furiouſly moved with thoſe either equals or inferiours with whom we have to do; we cannot chuſe but unſheath our paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fury and outragious diſturbance, into cniding and unquietneſſe; we can by no means bridle our ſelves in the leaſt degree; our humour muſt have its courſe; and then perchance afterwards, our thoughts reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves, do ſecretly check us, and make us ſorry again for this our raſhneſſe, heartily wiſhing that we had not done ſo, and that we were at one with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as before; onely that we be loth to confeſſe ſo much, or bewray the acknowledgement of our own errour. See the diſquieting unhappineſſe of ſin! If we do not thus vent our wrath, we can be at no reſt for fretting inwardly: and if we do vent it, we are diſpleaſed with our ſelves for doing it impatiently and undiſcreetly: others cannot pleaſe us, and we cannot pleaſe our ſelves: What peaceful harmony of concord or content can there then be to our ſouls? I ſay, Others cannot pleaſe us; for nature hath ſo out of all reaſon bent us to our own courſes, to our own minde, to our own wills in every thing, <hi>ut ferè nihil placet quod non noſtrum eſt;</hi> that almoſt nothing contents us, but that which is of our own doing and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; it even cuts to the gall to be any way croſſed and contradicted in our intentions and deſires: when we have once took an opinion, let it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by whom it will be, ſtiff-neck'd nature being
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169411:36"/>
uncontroll'd by grace, it is ſo obſtinate in her own ſenſe, that 'tis as death for her not to have it go and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in her own way; and therefore let it fadge how it will, we muſt, I ſay, we muſt needs prevail in contending, though it be for the worſe: and when at length we have thus peradventure through much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty obtained our deſire, and gotten our wills fulfill'd, even then alſo are not our thoughts happie therein: though for the preſent it might ſeem to delight us, yet are we not long well pleaſed therewith in our ſelves; nay, perhaps that alſo in the end gives our minde little ſatisfaction; 'tis nothing but our conceit, nothing but that we would have it ſo, and then would it had not been ſo; this is the courſe of it: ſo little peace of minde is there to that ſoul which is without God, and left alone in the ſnare of ſin.</p>
               <p>Sure enough it is, O let us obſerve it; I ſay, Sure enough, that our own will is always our worſt enemy, could we but conſider it: nay methinks, for all ſhe ſeems to be as our onely friend, yet in truth we have no other enemy can do us hurt, but onely her: not the malice of all the creatures, men and devils in the world, are able to bring upon us the leaſt unhappineſſe without her help.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>It is this Own ſelf and Will of ours that parts us from God, joyns us in ſociety with the devil; and thus brings us at length (if not prevented by Grace) to the certain deſtruction both of body and ſoul. It is our Saviours counſel, that if our <hi>eye, hand,</hi> or other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>offend us,</hi> we ſhould <hi>cut it off, and caſt it from us:</hi> this doubtleſſe is a moſt difficult thing, a hard ſaying, for a man to cut off his own fleſh, that which is ſo cloſe and neer unto him, and indeed I believe that wholly to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:169411:36"/>
part our ſelves from our ſelves, is to divide <hi>indiviſibilè,</hi> that which as long as we continue mortal men, is not to be divided: but to cut off thoſe rank grown extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of our wills, this proud fleſh, theſe limbs of the devil, that muſt needs be done, if we mean to follow Chriſt, and enter into heaven, unleſſe together with them we will be caſt into hell fire, to follow Chriſt: for this is the right way to follow him, by <hi>denying our ſelves;</hi> becauſe we plainly finde both by his moſt holy Doctrine, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 34, and Example, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 36, that his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in this world was not to do any thing of his own will, the will of man, but in all things <hi>the will of him that ſent him,</hi> even the will of God.</p>
               <p>But further; to ſee what a deal of trouble and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe is there always ſtirring in the ſinful minde of man? what a reſtleſſe vexation another while do the ambitious projects and aſpiring motions of our vain imagination put us unto? even ſo far, that ſure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it is an Ixion's task, or as a Bridewell-work to undergo the toil that ſuch encroaching and climing thoughts many times torment us with. How doth our fancie labour to be ſo great, ſo high, ſo rich, that we had ſuch an office or eſtate, that we were in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch a man and ſuch a man? and thus when we have vainly ſuppoſed ſo far and ſo far; when, like the Giants of whom the Poets do fable, we have ſet one mountain of ambitious deſires upon another, yet then at laſt are we as far from ſatisfaction as they were from heaven.</p>
               <p>Again, in the proſecution of our earthly policy, when the event of things that do much concern us fruſtrates our expectation, our lowe creeping mindes, that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice onely to their own nets, to their own skill and wiſedom; how do they ſnarl themſelves in blinde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures? <hi>Lo, this doubtleſſe was the cauſe that our buſineſſe took not effect; it ſhould have been done by ſuch or ſuch a means, it ſuch or ſuch a time, with theſe or theſe Circumſtances;</hi>

out our ſelves to ſeek the reaſon thereof, like thoſe blinde men that ſought <hi>Lot</hi>'s door and could not finde it; never thinking all this while on the Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which directeth all things, towards which our thoughts ought to aim their firſt and chief regard: and therefore it is that oftentimes we do try ſo many ways, ſpend ſo much time, break ſo many nights ſleep, to no purpoſe: for ſure, <hi>Except the Lord keep the Citie,</hi> all our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is loſt, <hi>the watchman waketh but in vain.</hi> As <hi>Jehu</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Jehoram,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9, ſo may we anſwer our thoughts, and with ſufficient experience reſolve our ſelves; <hi>What peace,</hi> content or reſt <hi>can there be, ſo long as</hi> this <hi>Jezebel</hi> of ſin raigns and remains within us?</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>No peace within, nor yet no peace without,</l>
                  <l>But full of troubles, toils, and fears, and doubt.</l>
                  <l>Our peace with all things utterly doth ceaſe,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe with God we do not make our peace.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>And thus on every ſide we both ſee and feel it, even too much, to our own grief, That <hi>there is no peace unto the wicked.</hi> The man of Sin, is a man of Trouble; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his minde with the diſtractions of ſin; trouble in his conſcience with fear of judgement; every way diſturbed and out of reſt: and yet lo, for all this, that there is ſo much unquietneſſe, and trouble, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content in our ſinnes, we are ſo ſtrongly hampered and engaged therein, that there is no power in us to break off <hi>the bands</hi> thereof, or <hi>caſt away</hi> her <hi>cords from us:</hi> through the habituated continuance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it is ſo hard and difficult for us to repent, I mean, fully and perfectly to repent, that it goes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt might to think of making up a reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and an account with God: we are ſo totally as it were turned into ſin it ſelf, I mean, ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible diſpoſition of ſinning in all our converſation,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:169411:37"/>
that O <hi>who ſhall deliver us from this body of death?</hi> what courſe can we take to come out of this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe? 'Tis high time to look about us, to raiſe our thoughts to ſome better notions: but ſuch is the difficulty of true Repentance, that we cannot go thorow ſtitch with it; but this and this opportunity is ſtill put off with excuſes, with the preſumptuous and flattering conceit that Gods mercy is infinite; we have had often and often trial of it; <hi>Doubtleſſe we ſhall have ſome better time and more fitting ſeaſon hereafter.</hi> But we who finde it ſo hard a matter at this time, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand to one but that we finde it more difficult the next: the longer we continue in ſin without due Repentance, the more methinks are we entangled with it, and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſnarl'd the faſter from getting out. O therefore let us take heed in time, and duely <hi>conſider this, all we that</hi> now <hi>forget God;</hi> Conſider this, I ſay, whilſt we have time afforded us, leſt in his wrath he ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pluck us away, and there be none to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us.</p>
               <p>Here it is obſervable, according to what I have formerly intimated, that, though not uſually, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Conſcience is ſo cunningly daub'd up, that it ſeems within us to be as well ſatisfied with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward formality of Religion, as if it were in the ſtate of grace and true reconciliation: <hi>our mouthes</hi> and the outſide of our thoughts do <hi>draw neer</hi> unto God, when-as <hi>our hearts,</hi> the true depth of our heart, <hi>is far from</hi> him, even full of nothing but dead mens bones, the rottenneſſe and corruption of ſin: we are, I ſay, thus ſo ſmoothly deluded in our ſelves, that we can ſeem boldly to chalenge acquaintance with Chriſt, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps think that we are able to boaſt of great matters in his Name, and yet for all that peradventure as it was with thoſe in the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. peradventure, I ſay, Chriſt himſelf may never ſo much as know or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge one jot of Chriſtianity within us: but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169411:38"/>
this deceitfulneſſe of Religion, this ſuperficial delight is eaſily diſcerned, if we mark it well, both by our ſelves and others, in that it is frequently wont to vent it ſelf into a partial ſiding, contentious talking, part-taking and debating as thoſe of whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, that fell out about their Religion; <hi>I am of Paul, I am of Apollo, I am of Cephas;</hi> taking the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow for the ſubſtance, and miſtaking the truth thereof, as though it were a thing ſo ſhallowly ſeated in the ſoul, that it conſiſted in wittineſſe of diſcourſe, ſharp underſtanding, following of Opinions, and the like: no verily, <hi>the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> Religion and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>is</hi> not without, as our Saviour ſaith, but <hi>within us,</hi> even in the dreſſing, ordering and managing of our own ſouls.

               <lg>
                  <l>Our Knowledge without Charity may ſwell</l>
                  <l>Into Contentious ſtrivings full of pride:</l>
                  <l>But true Religion in that heart doth dwell,</l>
                  <l>Where patience, love, and humble thoughts abide.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>what ever or however the Conſcience, as I ſay, may thus be deluded and held in ſome pleaſing ſatisfaction, finely skinned over for a while with the upper part of Religion; yet in the truth of it, the wound that is ſo deep, is not ſo eaſily cured; this ſinfulneſſe of the minde here ſpoken of, having gotten ſuch time and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty with us, is not without great difficulty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deep ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, many prayers, and much carefulneſſe, took off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and therefore till we can by Gods ſpecial mercy attain unto this thorow piercing and happie Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, there is none ſo ſoveraign and helpful a means to prevent the dangerous encreaſe thereof, as is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant following of a good employment, ever to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one induſtrious action or another, according to the quality and manner of our life, even in one honeſt action or other, though it be but to little advantage:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169411:38"/>
ſo that the Rule is very true, <hi>Praeſtat orioſum eſſe, quam nihil agere;</hi> It were far better for us to be in action with that which is to no purpoſe, ſo that we do not ſin in it, then to ſit ſtill and be altogether idle: for alas, we do by woful experience finde, that Idleneſſe is rightly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med The devils Cuſhion; being ſeldome out of one ſin or other, whilſt we are out of action in ſome good employment: This Cuſhion makes the devil ſo eaſie a ſeat, that it is even an invincible work to remove him from our idle ſouls, or make him ſit away: this is his ſeat, I ſay, and his ſhop too; here he freely ſits and plyes his utmoſt skill, to mould our thoughts to the very wickedneſſe of his hearts deſire; here he ſits forging and faſhioning all the uglieſt forms of ſin, and fouleſt monſters of impiety that ever entred into the heart of man: there is no ſin ſo great, ſo helliſh and inhumane, but Idleneſſe hath been the means to hatch it into the world.</p>

object, converting it to ſome libidinous and wanton mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the which perchance ſometimes doth cling ſo faſt unto us, that we can ſcarcely draw off again our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination from it.</p>
               <p>Again, Idleneſſe and Luxury, the exceſſe of eating and drinking, either in quantity or quality; I ſay, <hi>fulneſſe of bread, and abundance of Idleneſſe,</hi> are conſtant compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons together: we that are idle, muſt needs be luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one way or other. And if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid that the idle perſon was not worthy to eat or drink at all; how often and how much do we ſin, when as the vanity of our idle ſouls cauſeth us to waſte ſo much in ſuperfluity, who are not worthy of ſufficiency? O alas, ſo we live many times, as if we were created for nothing elſe but to eat and drink. Sure this is not the leaſt, if not the greateſt of our ſins: for if abſtinence be the chiefeſt help to mortifie the fleſh, certainly luxury is the chiefeſt means to quench all goodneſſe of the Spirit: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee in the Goſpel the devils deſire to enter into the Swine; we hear of no other creature that at any time they deſired to enter into, but onely, I ſay, into the gluttonous Swine, that of all other creatures being moſt uncleanly addicted to its belly; ſo fit an habitation is the gluttonous and luxurious ſoul for nothing but devils, but ſin and uncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p>But further with the ſtory: our whole man is ſo ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disframed and disjoynted with ſin, that there is no part but is out of order.

then all our former ſins, and diſtempers beſides; for when perchance we endeavour to ſettle our thoughts upon Humiliation, and are ready to take upon us the examination of our wicked and ſinful life, as lifting up our thoughts into this Meditation: <hi>Oh how the time paſſeth away! the daily-conſuming torch of our life burneth out apace, and ſhall we continue ſtill in this deſolate and deplored condition without due Repentance and reconciliation with God? how far are are we from that glorious comfort and moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ſtate we uſe to enjoy in the time of grace?</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Well, theſe hideous glances do perchance ever and anon ſlip into the imagination, and are very terrible and tedious unto us. But many times it falls out for a while, until we either better underſtand our ſelves herein, or that God ſhew forth his power more ſtrongly in us: I ſay it falls out many times, that the earneſt employment of our minde in the fears, cares and deſires of other things, doth not ſuffer us ſo ſeriouſly to tend for them, or elſe doth put them out of remembrance again; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ever and anon they do come into our heads to diſturb and terrifie us moſt wonderfully. But ſpecially 'tis to be noted, that if at any time we go about to read, or ſet our ſelves diligently upon the work of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, then ſure they are abundantly preſent with us: and becauſe they are ſo terrible that we cannot abide them, we muſt therefore needs leave off whatſoever we have took in hand; and this we may conceive to be a ſpecial policie of the devil, to have them chiefly propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to our phancie at ſuch times, to the end, if it could be ſo, there might be no time for us to repent in: For now methinks at length, through a due ſelf-conſideration, and theſe manifold checking troubles and inconveniences, which ſo diſturb us, that we cannot tell which way to turn for them; doubtleſſe, I ſay, we have great longing to be reconciled unto God, and we would very fain repent, putting our ſtrength really to it, did not now theſe Scar crowes ſtand in the way to affright us: and now in this (though not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) we can truely repent that we did not repent heretofore, that we had not <hi>drawn neer unto the Lord whilſt he might be found,</hi> ſince that in thoſe great wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-floods,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169411:47"/>
this day of trouble and temptation, we cannot come nigh unto him: for moſt deſervedly we that have continued ſo long in our ſins for our own pleaſure, to content our ſelves, muſt yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a while longer to content Gods juſtice. As yet then for all this, though the <hi>Ax</hi> be as it were <hi>laid to the root of the tree,</hi> Gods judgement and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to our evil Conſciences, yet we cannot leave off the deceitfulneſſe of our ſouls, our oppreſſing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, the vanity of our minde, the excuſing our ſins, the ſwelling and ſelf-conceited folly of our hearts, and the like.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, that according to the method in this Book before premiſed, moſt of us men have ſome one part or ſpace of our life (be it four or five yeers, or whatſoever) wherein ſin hath more full power over us, and perhaps doth thus prevail in us with an high hand and ſetled courſe, and this time above all the reſt is the time of ſin, as being ſo properly diſpoſed for it, that during the continuance thereof, we can never attain unto true Repentance: for though that we may ſometimes ſuperficially fallow up our ſouls with the Sollow of Humiliation, yet do we not ſo thorowly plow them up as to fit them for the due receiving of that good ſeed which is able to fructifie into newneſſe of life. Sure this is not an eaſie thing:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>A perfect ſinner doth not change his hue,</l>
                  <l>So quickly turning his old life to new.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Though we may peradventure many times outwardly ſcan over the duty of Repentance, yet do we not during this time ſo perfectly repent, as thereby to get a full Releaſe from the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> guilt of ſin, or ſuch a comfortable
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169411:48"/>
and a diſcharging acquittance to our Conſciences, as we ought to have, and which maketh us chearful and free powerfully to reſolve and ſet on towards amendment of life.</p>
               <p>Well, to the matter. I ſay, What by one means or other, we are yet ſtill ſcared off from the main hope and help of our ſouls, the comfort of Reconciliation; ſo great is our ſinful folly and unability unto good. But this, all this, is but for a taſte of inward trouble: See what follows: the hand of the Almighty doth not leave us ſo; if a man will <hi>not turn,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal 7, God <hi>will whet his ſword:</hi> he hath <hi>bent his bowe, and made it ready:</hi> hitherto there is no turning with us, nothing is able to turn us unto a due ſerious repenting, or ſufficiently to rouze us up out of the unhappie Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of ſin; and therefore ſure God is now whetting his ſword and bending his bowe againſt us As <hi>Lazr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Dangerous diſeaſes deſerve deſperate cures. If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe can thorowly awake us, the Judgement of a troubled minde and tormented Conſcience muſt do it.

               </p>
               <p>I ſay, There be in the ſoul of man many tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting thoughts; as alſo ſins of ours, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Scripture often too hard for us well to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt: but this enſuing Paſſage of a diſtracted minde and troubled Conſcience is ſeldom paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd.</p>
               <p>For lo, I ſhall herein ſhew you a Myſtery, even welnigh the very height and utmoſt pitch of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and ſad Diſtraction that the melancholy minde can undergo without falling quite into Fury and Madneſſe, which doth fitly follow this more then ordinary ill courſe of life here preſuppoſed, and ſo long a ſleep in preſumption.</p>
               <p>For this is the right Method in the ſtate of the ſoul: before ſuch great trouble of minde, there u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually precedes a deep ſleep in Preſumption, becauſe the minde and Conſcience can never be very much inwardly troubled, (it may ſuffer ſome ſmall diſtreſſe)
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169411:49"/>
I ſay, never be much troubled, as long as <hi>fear,</hi> the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the ſoul, keeps his due centry. And therefore this is the true wiſedom of a careful Chriſtian, diligently to keep this watch about him, leſt he be overtaken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted and engaged in ſin, and ſo then <hi>the day of the Lord come upon him like a thief in the night:</hi> I ſay, <hi>the day of the Lord,</hi> the day of his Judgement, <hi>a day of gloomineſſe and thick darkneſſe;</hi> a day of trouble and diſtraction of minde, even ſuch a day (as is expreſt in the next Part) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord thundreth from heaven with his mighty power againſt the ſoul of man,</p>

It is ſaid indeed in the ſixth Chap. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that <hi>every imagination of the thoughts of mans heart are onely evill continually.</hi> But O theſe and the like thoughts, as I may ſay, even ſent from Hell into the ſoul of man, are ſo beyond meaſure unreaſonably evill, that we ſhall many times think to our ſelves, think it, I ſay, to be a thing almoſt impoſſible, that man, as a meer man, and being only in the mortall condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, ſhould be capable of entertaining ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable things within him: As alſo ſometimes we ſhall think thus, that if other men did but know what vile imaginations, what monſtrous indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties there are in our heads, they would ſure be ready to kill us out of zeale to piety, and revenge to Gods glory, as not fit to live on earth, who are in truth full of nothing but Hell: Many times perhaps are our thoughts of ſuch high and immediate impiety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we verily look for one fearfull judgement or other preſently to confound us, and do even quake and crouch down, as though ſome fierce thunderbolt of vengeance were already falling from Heaven upon us: Theſe thoughts they are not all of them evill in the ſame degree, ſome it may be being far worſe then ſome; as alſo, they are not all of the ſame nature, for the diverfity of every ones conſtitution, and the diverſity or ſeverall kinds of ſins, to which we are moſt addicted, do perchance much varie the nature of them; yet moſt of them in the ſame particular party (ſpecially at the firſt) do ever point to one kind of end and effect; in a while the much prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtrength of theſe thoughts hath ſuch a terrifying power in us, that even but one of them is ſufficient to ſtrike an heart-breaking paſſion of ſo great a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and diſtemper into us, that we ſhall not be wholly out of it again for a whole day after, being uſually in the mean ſpace revolving in our minds

the works of him that ſent thee into the world, ſo muſt we alſo work the will of our father which is in Heaven. 3. That as thou didſt it in thy day, ſo muſt we do it in our day, this day of our life. 4. For as the night, the night of thy Paſſion commeth, ſo our night of death is continually approaching. 5. And then no man can work, even no man at all can work out his ſalvation. O excellent rule I here is roome enough for our ſouls to exerciſe their thoughts day and night, even this day of working untill that night of reſt; this day of life untill that night of death, when no man can work.
