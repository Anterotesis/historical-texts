            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE have had the History of <hi>Aesop</hi> so many times over and over, and drest-up so many several Ways; that it would be- but La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Lost to Multiply Unprofitable Conjectures upon a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so Great Uncertainty. Writers are divided about him, almost to all manner of purposes: And particularly concerning the Authority, even of the greater part of Those Compositions that pass the World in his Name: For, the Story is come down to us so Dark and Doubtful, that it is Impossible to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the <hi>Original</hi> from the <hi>Copy:</hi> And to say, which of the Fables are <hi>Aesops,</hi> and which <hi>not;</hi> which are <hi>Genuine,</hi> and which <hi>Spurious:</hi> Beside, that there are divers Inconsistencies upon the Point of <hi>Chronology,</hi> in the Account of his Life, (as <hi>Maximus Planudes,</hi> and Others have Deliver'd it) which the whole Earth can never Reconcile. <hi>Vavasor</hi> the <hi>Josuite,</hi> in a Tract of his, <hi>de Ludicra Dictione,</hi> takes Notice of some four or five Gross Mistakes of This Kind. <hi>[Planudes</hi> (says he) <hi>brings</hi> Aesop <hi>to</hi> Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ylon, <hi>in the Reign of</hi> Lycerus; <hi>where there never was such a Prince heard of, from</hi> Nabonassar (<hi>the first King of</hi> Babylon) <hi>to</hi> Alexander the Great. <hi>He tells also of his going into</hi> Aegypt <hi>in the Days of King</hi> Nectenabo; <hi>which</hi> Nectenabo <hi>came not into the World till well nigh Two Hundred Years after him. And so he makes him Greet his Mistress upon his first Entrance into his Master's House, with a Bitter Sentence against Women out of</hi> Euripides; (<hi>as he pretends</hi>) <hi>when yet</hi> Aesop <hi>had been Dead, a matter of Fourscore Years, before T'other was Born. And once again, He brings him in, Talking of the</hi> Pyraean Port, <hi>in his Fable of the</hi> Ape and the Dolphin: <hi>A Port, that the very Name on't was never thought of, till about the</hi> Seventy Sixt Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad: And <hi>Aesop</hi> was Murder'd, in the <hi>Four and Fifti'th.]</hi> This is enough in All Conscience, to Excuse any Man from laying over-much Stress upon the Historical Credit of a Relation, that comes so Blindly, and so Variously Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us: Over and above, that it is not one jot to our Bus'ness (further then to Gratify an Idle Curiosity) whether the <hi>Fact</hi> be <hi>True or False;</hi> whether the <hi>Man</hi> was <hi>Streight,</hi> or <hi>Crooked;</hi> and his <hi>Name, Aesop,</hi> or (as some will have it) <hi>Lochman:</hi> In All which Cases, the Reader is left at Liberty to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Pleasure. We are not here, upon the <hi>Name,</hi> the <hi>Person,</hi> or the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:66024:3"/>
of This Great Man; but upon the Subject of his <hi>Apologues</hi> and <hi>Morals;</hi> And not of <hi>His</hi> alone, but of several other Eminent Men that have Written after his Copy; and abundantly Contributed in those Labours, to the Delight, Benefit, and Instruction of Those that were to come after them.</p>
            <p>There are, 'tis True, a Certain Set of Morose and Untractable Spirits in the World, that look upon Precepts in <hi>Emblem,</hi> as they do upon <hi>Gays</hi> and <hi>Pictures,</hi> that are only fit for <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and make no more reck'ning of them, then of the Fooleries of so many <hi>Old Wives Tales.</hi> These are a sort of People that are Resolv'd to be pleas'd with nothing that is not <hi>Unsociably Soure, Ill Natur'd,</hi> and <hi>Troublesome;</hi> Men that make it the <hi>Mark</hi> as well as the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> to be <hi>Magisterial,</hi> and <hi>Churlish;</hi> As if a Man could not be <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Honest,</hi> without being <hi>Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane;</hi> or, I might have said, without putting an Affront upon <hi>Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Civil Society, Decency</hi> and <hi>Good Manners:</hi> But they are not aware All this while, that the <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> are laid in our <hi>Childhood;</hi> when Nothing goes Kindly down with us, that is not Season'd and Adapted to the Palate and Capacity of 'those Tender Years. 'Tis in the very <hi>Nature</hi> of us, first, to be Inquisitive, and Hankering after New and New <hi>Sights</hi> and <hi>Stories:</hi> And 2dly, No less Sollicitous to Learn and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of what we <hi>See</hi> and <hi>Hear:</hi> So that betwixt the Indulging and Cultivating of This <hi>Disposition,</hi> or <hi>Inclination,</hi> on the <hi>One</hi> hand, and the Applying of a Profitable <hi>Moral</hi> to the <hi>Figure,</hi> or the <hi>Fable,</hi> on the <hi>Other,</hi> here's the Sum of All that can be done upon the Point of a <hi>Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Discipline</hi> and <hi>Institution,</hi> toward the Forming of an Honourable, and a Vertuous Life. Most Certain it is, that without This Early Care and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon the Main, we are as good as Lost in our very Cradles; for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that we Imbibe in our Youth, we carry commonly to our Graves; and it is the Education, in short, that makes the Man. To speak All, in a Few Words, <hi>Children</hi> are but <hi>Blank Paper,</hi> ready Indifferently for any Impression, Good or Bad, for they take All upon Credit; and it is much in the Power of the first Comer, to Write Saint, or Devil upon't, which of the Two He pleases. Wherefore let the <hi>Method</hi> of Communication be never so Natural and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the Better, the Worse still, if the <hi>Matter</hi> be not Suited to the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the Piety, and the Tenderness that is Requisite in the Exercise of such a Function. Now This is a Nicety that Depends, in a Great Measure, upon the <hi>Care, Providence, Sobriety, Conduct</hi> and <hi>Good Example</hi> of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Guardians, Tutors,</hi> &amp;c. Nay it Descends to the very Choice of such <hi>Nurses, Servants,</hi> and Familiar <hi>Companions,</hi> as will apply themselves Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to the Discharge of This Office.</p>
            <p>As it is beyond All Dispute, I suppose, that the Delight and Genius of Children, lies much toward the Hearing, Learning, and Telling of Little
<pb facs="tcp:66024:3"/>
Stories; So this Consideration holds forth to us a kind of Natural Direction to begin our Approches upon that Quarter, toward the Initiating of them into some sort of Sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Understanding of their Duty. And This may most properly be done in a way of <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Moral;</hi> and in such a manner, that the Truth and Reason of Things, may be Artificially and Effectually Insinuated, under the Cover, either of a <hi>Real Fact,</hi> or of a <hi>Supposed</hi> One: But then These very Lessons Themselves may be Gilt and Sweeten'd, as we Order Pills and Potions; so as to take off the Disgust of the Remedy; for it holds, both in <hi>Vertue,</hi> and in <hi>Health,</hi> that we love to be <hi>Instructed,</hi> as well as <hi>Plisick'd,</hi> with <hi>Pleasure.</hi> This is an Article that would both Bear and Require a Volume: But without Dwelling any longer upon it, I shall content my self with some short General Touches, and so Proceed.</p>
            <p>It may be laid down in the First Place, for an <hi>Universal Rule,</hi> never to suffer Children to Learn any thing, (now <hi>Seeing,</hi> and <hi>Hearing,</hi> with Them, is <hi>Learning</hi>) but what they may be the Better for All their Lives after. And it is not sufficient neither, to keep Men clear of any Thought, Word or Deed, that's <hi>Foul, Scandalous,</hi> and <hi>Dishonest;</hi> but there are Twenty Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid <hi>Twittle-Twattles,</hi> Frothy <hi>Jests,</hi> and Iingling <hi>Witticisms,</hi> that look, as if they had no Hurt in them; and yet the Wonting of us to the Use and Liking of These Levities, Leads, and Inures us to a <hi>Mis-understanding</hi> of Things, that's no less Dangerous then a Corruption o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Manners.</hi> Beside, that there's no need of Entertaining them with These Fopperies, having so much Choice of Useful Matter at hand, and as Good Cheap. Briefly, in the Case of This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Instruction and Institution, let but the Fancy or the Figure be Clear and Pertinent, and the Doctrine in the Direction of it can never fail of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so too. But without This Guard and Caution upon the Conduct of the Affair, This Humour of <hi>Mythology</hi> may turn to a <hi>Poyson</hi> instead of a <hi>Nourishment:</hi> And under the Pretext of a Lecture of <hi>Good Government,</hi> Degenerate into an Encouragement to <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Debauch.</hi> For while the Memory is Firm, and the Iudgment Weak, it is the <hi>Director</hi>'s Part to <hi>Judge</hi> for the <hi>Pupil,</hi> as it is the <hi>Disciples,</hi> to <hi>Remember</hi> for <hi>Himself;</hi> And we are also to take This along with us, that when a Child has once Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted an Ill Train or Habit, it will Cost as much time to Blot out what he is to <hi>Forget,</hi> as to Possess him of what he is to Retain in his <hi>Memory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let it not be Understood now, as if the <hi>Thing it self</hi> were <hi>Childish,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the <hi>Application</hi> of it; or as if Boys and Men were not Indifferently of the same Make, and Accountable more or less for the same Faculties and Duties. So that the Force and Dignity of This way of Operation, holds good in all Cases alike; For there's Nothing makes a Deeper Impression upon the Minds of Men, or comes more Lively to their Understanding, then Those I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I shall now Wind up what I have to say, as to the <hi>Fables Themselves,</hi> the <hi>Choice,</hi> the <hi>Intent,</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> of them, in a very Few Words.</p>
            <p>When I first put Pen to Paper upon This Design, I had in my Eye only the Common <hi>School-Book,</hi> as it stands in the <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford Editions</hi> of it, under the Title of <hi>[Aesopi Phrygis Fabulae; unà cum Nonnullis Variorum Autorum Fabulis Adjectis:]</hi> Propounding to my self, at that Time, to follow the very Course and Series of that Collection; and in One Word, to Try what might be done, by making the Best of the Whole, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapting Proper and Useful Doctrines to the several parts of it, toward the turning of a <hi>Excellent Latin Manual</hi> of Morals and Good Councels, into a <hi>Tolerable English One.</hi> But upon Iumbling Matters and Thoughts together, and laying One thing by Another; the very State and Condition of the Case before me, together with the Nature and the Reason of the Thing, gave me to Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that This way of Proceeding would never Answer my End. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that upon this Consideration, I Consulted other Versions of the same Fables, and made my Best of the Choice. Some that were <hi>Twice</hi> or <hi>Thrice over,</hi> and only the self-same Thing in other Words; These I struck out, and made <hi>One Specimen</hi> serve for the rest. To say Nothing of here and there a Trivial, or a Loose Conceit in the Medley, more than This; that such as they are, I was under some sort of Obligation to take them in for Company; and in short, Good, Bad and Indifferent, One with Another, to the Number in the Total, of 383. Fables. To these, I have likewise subjoyn'd a Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Addition of other Select <hi>Apologues,</hi> out of the most Celebrated Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that are Extant upon that Subject, toward the Finishing of the Work.

               </gap>oleries of <hi>Apology,</hi> and <hi>Excuse,</hi> for such an Undertaking: As if the Honestest, and the most Necessary Part of a Man's Life, and Bus'ness, were a thing to be Asham'd of. Now All that I have to say upon this <hi>Common Place,</hi> is in Three Words, that I meant well in what I have done; and let the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance be what it will, I Comfort my self yet in the Conscience of a Good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I shall not Charge any of My Failings upon the Importunity of my Friends, though I have not Wanted Earnest and Powerful Instances and Encouragements to proceed upon This Work; over and above the Impulse of a Natural Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and Inclination that led me to't. But these were Temptations that I could Easily have Resisted, or put by, in favour of a Carcass that's in a manner, past Labour; if it had not been for Another Motive, that I shall now tell the Reader in Confidence, and so Conclude.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Rhapsody</hi> of <hi>Fables</hi> is a Book Universally Read, and Taught in All our Schools; but almost at such a rate as we Teach <hi>Pyes</hi> and <hi>Parrots,</hi> that Pronounce the Words without so much as Guessing at the Meaning of them: Or to take it Another way, the Boys Break their Teeth upon the Shells, without ever coming near the Kernel. They Learn the <hi>Fables</hi> by <hi>Lessons,</hi> and the Moral is the least part of our Care in a Childs Institution: so that take Both together, and the One is stark Nonsense, without the Application of the Other; beside that the Doctrine it self, as we have it, even at the Best, falls Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely short of the Vigour and Spirit of the Fable. To supply This Defect now, we have had several English <hi>Paraphrases</hi> and <hi>Essays</hi> upon <hi>Aesop,</hi> and Divers of his Followers, both in <hi>Prose</hi> and <hi>Verse</hi>: the Latter have perchance Ventur'd a litte too far from the Precise Scope of the Author, upon the Privilèdge of a Poetical License: And for the Other of Ancient Date, the <hi>Morals</hi> are so <hi>Insipid</hi> and <hi>Flat,</hi> and the <hi>Style</hi> and <hi>Diction</hi> of the <hi>Fables,</hi> so <hi>Course</hi> and <hi>Uncouth,</hi> that they are rather Dangerous, than Profitable, as to the purpose they were Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally Intended for; and likely to do Forty times more Mischief by the One then Good by the Other. An <hi>Emblem</hi> without a <hi>Key</hi> to't, is no more then a <hi>Tale of a Tub;</hi> and that Tale sillily told too, is but One Folly Grafted upon Another. Children are to be Taught, in the first Place, what they <hi>Ought</hi> to do. <hi>2dly,</hi> The <hi>Manner</hi> of Doing it: And in the third Place, they are to be Inur'd, by the Force of <hi>Instruction</hi> and <hi>Good Example,</hi> to the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of Doing their <hi>Duty;</hi> whereas on the Contrary, One Step out of the way in the Institution, is enough to Poyson the Peace, and the Reputation of a whole Life. Whether I have, in this Attempt, Contributed or not, to the Emprovement of these Fables, either in the <hi>Wording,</hi> or in the <hi>Meaning</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:66024:6"/>
them, the Book must Stand or Fall to it self: But this I shall Adventure to Pronounce upon the whole Matter, that the <hi>Text</hi> is <hi>English,</hi> and the <hi>Morals,</hi> in some sort, Accommodate to the <hi>Allegory;</hi> which could hardly be said of All the Translations, or Reflexions before-mention'd, which have serv'd, in truth, (or at least some of them) rather to teach us what we should <hi>Not</hi> do, then what we <hi>should.</hi> So that in the Publishing of these Papers, I have done my Best to Obviate a <hi>Common Inconvenience,</hi> or, to speak Plainly, the <hi>Mortal Error</hi> of pretending to Erect a Building upon a False Foundation: Leaving the whole World to take the same Freedom with Me, that I have done with Others: Provided that they do not Impute the <hi>Faults,</hi> and the Mis-Pointings of the <hi>Press,</hi> to the <hi>Author,</hi> and that they Consult the <hi>Errata</hi> for other <hi>Mistakes.</hi>

This Imperfection is said, to have been the most sensible part of his Misfortune; for the Excellency of his Mind might otherwise have Attoned in some Measure, for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66024:11"/>
Appearance of his Person (at least if That Part of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story may pass for Current.) There goes a Tradition, that he had the good hap to Relieve certain Priests that were Hungry, and out of their way, and to set them Right again, and that for that good Office, he was, upon their Prayers, brought to the Use of his Tongue: But <hi>Camerarius</hi> whom I shall Principally follow, has no Faith in the Miracle, And so he begins his History with the tracing of him to <hi>Samos,</hi> and from thence Prosecutes it through the most Remarkable Passages of his Life, to the Last Barbarous Violence upon him at <hi>Delphos.</hi> As to his Impediment in his speech, whether there were any such thing or Not, or how he came to be cur'd of it, the Reader is at Liberty what to Believe and what Not. And so likewise for Twenty Other Passages up and down this History; Some of them too Triviall, and others too Gross to be taken Notice of, Upon this Argument and Occasion: Let it suffice, that (according to the Common Tradition) he had been Alreadie Twice Bought and Sold; and so we shall Date the Story of his Adventures; from his Entrance into the Service of at least a Third Master.</p>
               <p>As to the Age he liv'd in, it is Agreed upon among the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, that it was when <hi>Croesus</hi> Govern'd <hi>Lydia;</hi> as also that <hi>Xanthus,</hi> a <hi>Samian,</hi> was his Master. <hi>Herodotus</hi> will have it to be one <hi>Iadmon,</hi> a <hi>Samian</hi> too; but still according to the Current of most Writers, <hi>Xanthus</hi> was the Man.</p>

               <p>UPON the Merchants Arrival at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he made a quick Riddance of All his Slaves but Three. That is to say, a <hi>Musician,</hi> an <hi>Orator,</hi> and <hi>Aesop.</hi> He dress'd up the Two Former in Habits answerable to their Profession, and Carry'd them to <hi>Samos,</hi> as the Likelyest Place for a Chapman. He shew'd them there in the open Market, with <hi>Aesop</hi> for a Fool betwixt them; which some People took much offence at. While they were attending upon the Place, there came among other <hi>Samians,</hi> one <hi>Xanthus</hi> an Eminent Philosopher of that City, with a Train of his Disciples at his Heels. The Philosopher was mightily pleased with the Two Youths, and ask'd them one after another about their Profession, and what they could do. The one told him he could do <hi>any thing,</hi> the other that he could do <hi>ev'ry thing;</hi> and this set <hi>Aesop</hi> a laughing at em. The Philosophers Pupils would Needs know what it was that made <hi>Aesop</hi> so merry. Why says he, if the Question had been put by your Master, I should have told him the reason of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xanthus</hi> in the mean time was beating the Price of the Two other Slaves, but the Terms were so high, that he was just upon turning about to go his way, Only his Pupils would needs have him put the same Questions first to the Ill favour'd Fellow, that he had done to the other Two; and so <hi>Xanthus,</hi> for the Humour sake, Interrogated <hi>Aesop</hi> what <hi>He</hi> could do. <hi>Nothing at all,</hi> says he. How comes That says the Philosopher? My Companions, says the Other, Undertakes every thing, and there's Nothing left for me to do. This gave them to Understand, that the Man knew well Enough what he say'd, and what he Laugh'd at. Well! says <hi>Xanthus,</hi> but if I should give Money for you Now, would you be Good and Honest? I'le be That, says <hi>Aesop</hi> whether you
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:66024:12"/>
Buy me or No. Ay but tell me again says the Philosopher, Wo'nt you run away? Pray says <hi>Aesop,</hi> did you ever hear of a Bird in a Cage that told his Master he Intended to make his Escape? <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> was well enough pleased with the Turn and Quickness of his Wit; but says he, That Unlucky Shape of yours will set People a Hooting and Gaping at you whereever you go. A Philosopher says <hi>Aesop</hi> should Value a man for his Mind, Not for his Body. This presence of Thought gave <hi>Xanthus</hi> a High Opinion of the Wisdom of the Man; and so he bad the Merchant set him his Lowest Price of That Miserable Creature. Why says he, you had as good Cheapen a Dunghill; but if you'l bid me like a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for either of the Other Two, you shall have this Phantome into the Bargaine. Very good says the Philosopher; and without any more ado what's your selling Price? The Merchant speaks the Word, The Philosopher pays the Money, and takes <hi>Aesop</hi> away with him.</p>

My Dear, says he, You have been often complaining of Careless Servants; And I have bought you one Now that I am Confident will fit your Turn. He shall Go and Come and Waite and do Every thing as you would have him; Oh, your Servant Sweet heart says she, but what did he Cost you? Why Truly very Reasonable; but at present He's a Little Tann'd and out of case you must know, with his Journy, says the Husband, and so he Order'd him to be Call'd in. The Cunning Gipsy smoak'd the Matter presently. Some Monster says she, I'le be Hanged else. Wife, Wife, says <hi>Xanthus</hi> If you are a good Woman That that Pleases Me Must Please You too. While These Words were between his Lips, up comes <hi>Aesop</hi> towards them, she gave him a Fierce Look, and Immediately discharg'd her Choler upon her Husband.

given me Now, of an Insufferable Hatred and Contempt? <hi>Aesop</hi> said not one Word all This While; 'till <hi>Xanthus</hi> Rowzd him with a Reproof. Oh Villain! says he; to have a Tongue and Wit at Will upon All other Occasions, and not one Diverting Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Now at a Pinch, to Pacify your Mistress! <hi>Aesop,</hi> after a short Pause upon't, Bolted out an old <hi>Greek</hi> Saying, which is in <hi>English</hi> to this Effect, <hi>From Lying at the Mercy of Fire, Water, and a Wicked Woman, Good Lord Deliver us.</hi> If the Wife was heartily angry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, This Scomm made her Stark Mad, and the Reproche was so Cutting too, that <hi>Xanthus</hi> himself did not well know how to take it.

For <hi>Aesop</hi> was Murder'd at least Fourscore Yeares before <hi>Euripides</hi> was Born.

                  <hi>CAP. V. Aesop</hi>'s Answer to a Gard'ner.</head>
               <p>SOME Two or Three Dayes after the Encounter above mentioned, <hi>Xanthus</hi> took <hi>Aesop</hi> a long with him to a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to buy some Herbs, and the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> seeing him in the Habit of a Philosopher, told him the Admiration he was in, to find how much faster Those Plants shot up that Grow of their own Accord, then Those that he set Himself, though he took never so much Care about them. Now you that are a Philosopher, Pray will you tell me the meaning of This? <hi>Xanthus</hi> had no better answer at hand, then to tell him, That Providence would have it so: Whereupon <hi>Aesop</hi> brake out into a Loud Laughter. Why how now Ye slave You, says <hi>Xanthus,</hi> what do you Laugh at? <hi>Aesop</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:66024:13"/>
took him aside and told him, S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> I Laugh at your Master, that Taught You no better: for what signifies a Gen'ral Answer to a Particular Question? And 'tis no News Neither that Providence orders All Things: But if you'l turn him over to me, You shall see I'le give him another sort of Resolve. <hi>Xanthus</hi> told the <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> that it was below a Philosopher to Busy his head about such Trifles; but says he, If you have a Curiosity to be better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, you should do well to ask my Slave here, and see what he le say to you. Upon This, the <hi>Gard'ner</hi> put the Question to <hi>Aesop,</hi> Who gave him this Answer. The Earth is in the Nature of a <hi>Mother</hi> to what She brings forth of her Self out of her own Bowels; Whereas She is only a kind of a <hi>Step Dame,</hi> in The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Plants that are Cultivated and Assisted by The Help and Industry of Another: so that it's Natural for her, to Withdraw her Nourishment from the One, towards The Reliefe of the Other. The <hi>Gard'ner,</hi> upon this, was so well satisfied, That he would take no Mony for his Herbs, and desired <hi>Aesop</hi> to make Use of his Garden for the future, as if it were his own.</p>
               <p>There are several Stories in <hi>Planudes,</hi> that I shall pass over in this Place (says <hi>Camerarius</hi>) as not worth the while: Particularly The Fables of the <hi>Lentills,</hi> the <hi>Bath,</hi> the <hi>Sows Feet,</hi> and several Little Tales and Jests that I take to be neither well Layd, nor well put together; Neither is it any matter, in Relations of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Whether they be True or False, but if they be Proper and Ingenious; and so contriv'd, that the Reader or the Hearer may be the better for them, That's as much as is required: Wherefore I shall now Commit to Writing Two Fables or Stories, One about the bringing his Mistress home again, when she had left her Husband; Which is drawn from the Modell of a Greek History set out by <hi>Pausanias</hi> in his Description of <hi>Beotia;</hi> The Other, upon the Subject of a Treat of <hi>Neates Tongues,</hi> which was taken from <hi>Bias,</hi> as we have it from <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his <hi>Convivium Septem Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientum.</hi>

                  <hi>CAP. VI. Aesop</hi>'s Invention to bring his Mistress back again to her Husband, after she had Left him.</head>
               <p>THE Wife of <hi>Xanthus</hi> was well-born and wealthy, but so Proud and Domineering withall, as if her Fortune and her Extraction had Entituled her to the Breeches. She was Horribly Bold, Medling, and <hi>Expensive;</hi> (as that sort of Women common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are) Easily put off the Hooks, and Monstrous hard to be pleased again: Perpetually chattering at her Husband, and upon All occasions of controversy, Threatning him to be gone. It came to this at Last, That <hi>Xanthus</hi>'s stock of Patience being quite spent, he took up a Resolution of going another way to Work with her, and of trying a Course of Severity, since there was nothing to be done with her by Kindness. But this Experiment, instead of mending The matter, made it worse; for upon harder Usage, The Woman grew Desperate, and went away from him in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest. She was as Bad 'tis true as Bad might well be, and yet <hi>Xanthus</hi> had a kind of <hi>Hankering</hi> for her still: Beside that there was matter of Interest in the Case: and a Pestilent Tongue she had, that the Poor Husband Dreaded above all things Under the Sun: but the man was willing however to make the Best of a Bad Game, and so his Wits and his Friends were set at Work, in the fairest Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that Might be, to get her home again. But there was No good to be done in't it seems; and <hi>Xanthus</hi> was so visibly out of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour upon't, that <hi>Aesop</hi> in Pure Pity bethought himself Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately how to Comfort him. Come Master (says he) Pluck up a good heart; for I have a Project in my Noddle that shall bring my Mistress to you back again, with as good a Will as ever she went from you. What does me <hi>Aesop,</hi> but away Immediately to the Market among the Butchers, Poulterers, Fishmongers, Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Best of Every thing that was in Season. Nay he takes private People in his way too, and Chopps into the very house of his Mistresses Relations, as by Mistake. This Way of Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding set the whole Towne a Gog to know the Meaning of all this Bustle, and <hi>Aesop</hi> innocently told every body That his Masters Wife was run away from him, and he had Marry'd another: His Friends up and down were all Invited to come and make Merry with him, and This was to be the Wedding Feast. The News flew like Lightning, and happy were they could carry the First Tydings of

it to the <hi>Run-away-Lady:</hi> (for every body knew <hi>Aesop</hi> to be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in That Family.) It Gathered in the Rolling, as all Other Stories do in the Telling: Especially where Womens Tongues and Passions have the Spreading of them. The Wife, that was in her Nature Violent, and Unsteady, order'd her Chariot to be made readie Immediately, and away she Posts back to her Husband: falls upon him with Outrages of Looks and Language; and after the Easing of her mind a Little; No <hi>Xanthus,</hi> says she, Do not you Flatter your selfe with the hopes of Enjoying another Woman while I am Alive. <hi>Xanthus</hi> look'd upon this as one of <hi>Aesop</hi>'s <hi>Master pieces;</hi> and for that Bout All was well again betwixt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and Mistress.</p>

Away they went together, and so strait into the Parlour, where the Blockhead Throws Himselfe downe Dirty and Beastly as he was, Upon a Rich Couch. After a very little While, in comes <hi>Xanthus</hi> to Supper, and asks <hi>Aesop</hi> who That Man was? Why This is the Man, says <hi>Aesop,</hi> that you sent me for; that is to say a Man that has no <hi>Curiosity</hi> in him at All. Oh that's very well, says <hi>Xanthus,</hi> and then told his Wife in her eare, That if she would but be a Loving and Obedient Wife to him, and do as he bad her, he would now save her Longing, for, says he, I have been a Great while Seeking for an Occasion to pick a Quarrell with <hi>Aesop,</hi> and I have found it at last. After this Whisper, <hi>Xanthus</hi> takes a Turn in the Parlour, and calls aloud to his Wife. Heark ye Sweet Heart, says he, go fetch some Water, and Wash the Feet of my Guest here. Away she goes, brings a Bason to the side of the Couch, where the Clown was lay'd at his Length, and bad him put forth his Feet for her to Wash them. <hi>Xanthus</hi> Little thought he would have done it.

There was a particular Dish that the Clown fed very Heartily upon: <hi>Xanthus</hi> fell into a Rage against the Cook for the Ill-Dressing of it, and Threatned to have him brought and Lash'd in the very Parlour. The <hi>Bumpkin</hi> took no Notice of it at All, but without Speaking one Word on the Cooks Behalf; It was Nothing to him he thought, what other People did with their Servants.</p>
               <p>They were come Now to their Cakes and Pyes, and the Clown Guttled Upon them without mercy. <hi>Xanthus</hi> Resolves then upon Another Tryal; Calls for his <hi>Pastry-Cook</hi> and tells him, Sirrah, says he, you spoile every thing that goes through your hands. There's neither Spice, nor any other Seasoning here. The Cook told him, That if they were either Over or Under-Bak'd, it was his Fault; But for the Spice and Seasoning, it was his Mistresses, for it was All put in that she De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd. Nay Wife, says <hi>Xanthus,</hi> if it sticks there, By All that's Sacred, I'le Treat you no better then if you were a Slave bought with my Mony. Wherefore Strip Immediately and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for a Dog-Whip. <hi>Xanthus</hi> thought with himself; that If any thing in the World could move this Barbarous Brute, he would have put in a Word at Least to save a Woman of Honour from so Scandalous an Indignity, But says this Loggerhead to himself; There's an old saying; <hi>What have Wee to do to Quench other Peoples Fires?</hi> And Ile e'en keep my selfe Clear of Other Peoples Matters; Only he took <hi>Xanthus</hi> by the Hand indeed, and told him if he would but Stay a Little, he'd go fetch his own Wife too, and so they might take the Lash by Turns. In one word, <hi>Xanthus</hi> missed his Aim at last; and though he was troubled at the Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he could not but Laugh yet at the Simplicity of the Man, and Confess, that <hi>Aesop</hi> was in the Right, in bringing a Person to him that had no Curiosity at all.</p>

               <p>IT happened some few days after the Last Passage above, that <hi>Xanthus,</hi> having some Business at the Publick Hall, sent <hi>Aesop</hi> to see if there were any Great Throng of Men there; A Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate meets him Upon the <hi>Way,</hi> and Asks him whether he was going? Why truly, says <hi>Aesop,</hi> I am going I know not whither. The Magistrate took it that he Banter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d him, and bad an Officer take him into Custody and Carry him to Prison. Well, says <hi>Aesop,</hi> to the Magistrate; Is it not true Now, that I did not know Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I was going? Can you Imagine, that when I came out of the house this Morning, I had any thoughts of going to <hi>Prison?</hi> The Magistrate was well enough pleased at the fancy, and Discharg'd him Upon it, and so he went forward to the Hall; Where among a world of People, he saw one Man arrest another upon an Action of Debt. The Debtor Pleaded Poverty; but if he would Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for halfe, it should go hard but he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Well with all my Heart, says the Creditor, Lay down the Mony upon the Nail, and the Business is done: for a man had better Content himself with Halfe, then Lose All, And I reckon that Mony as good as lost, that a Man must go to Law for; <hi>Aesop</hi> upon this, went back and told his Master, that he had been at the Hall, and saw but one Man there; This was a Riddle to <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus;</hi> Insomuch that he went himselfe to Learn the Truth of the Matter. When he came to the Place, he found the Court ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely Thronged, and turning short upon <hi>Aesop,</hi> in great Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Sirrah, says he, are All these People come since you told me there was but one Man here? 'Tis very true, says <hi>Aesop,</hi> There was a Huge Crow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>THERE happened not Long after This, to be a Merry Meeting of Philosophers; and <hi>Xanthus,</hi> one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. <hi>Xanthus</hi> had alreadie gotten a Cup too much; and <hi>Aesop</hi> finding they were like to set out his hand; Sir, says he, 'tis the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> they say, first to make men <hi>Cheerfull,</hi> and when they are past That, to make 'em <hi>Drunk,</hi> and in the Conclusion, to make them <hi>Mad. Xanthus</hi> took Offence at <hi>Aesop;</hi> and told him, That was a Lecture for Children. (<hi>Laertius</hi> makes this to be the saying of <hi>Anacharsis</hi>) The Cupps went round, and <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> by this Time had taken his Load, who was mightily given to talk in his Drink; and whatever was uppermost, out it came, without either Fear or Wit. One of the Company observing the weak side of the Man, took the Opportunity of Pumping him with several Questions. <hi>Xanthus</hi> (says he) I have read some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that it is Possible for a Man to Drink the Sea Dry; but I can hardly believe it. Why says <hi>Xanthus,</hi> Ile venture my House and Land upon't, that I do't my selfe. They Agreed upon the Wager, and presently off went their Rings to Seal the Conditions. But Early the next Morning, <hi>Xanthus</hi> missing his Ring, thought it might be slipt off his Finger, and asked <hi>Aesop</hi> about it. Why truly, says <hi>Aesop,</hi> I can say Nothing to the Loosing of your <hi>Ring;</hi> But I can tell you that <hi>you Lost your House and Land last night:</hi> and so <hi>Aesop</hi> told him the Story on't, which his Master it seems had utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. <hi>Xanthus</hi> began now to Chew upon the Matter, and it went to the Heart of him to consider, That he could neither do the thing, nor yet get quit of his Bonds. In this trouble of Thoughts he Consults <hi>Aesop,</hi> (whose advice before he had rejected) what was to be done in the Case. I shall never forget, says <hi>Xanthus,</hi> how much I owe you for your Faithful Services; and so with fair Words <hi>Aesop</hi> was prevailed upon to Undertake the bringing of him off. 'Tis Impossible to doe the thing (says he) but if I can find a way to Dissolve the Obligation, and to gaine you Credit by it over and Above, That's the Point I suppose that will do your business. The Time appointed, says <hi>Aesop,</hi> is now at hand, Wherefore do you set a bold face upon it, and goe to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66024:17"/>
                  <hi>Sea side</hi> with all your Servants and your Trinkets about you, and put on a Countenance, that you are just Now about to make good your Undertaking. You'l have Thousands of Spectators there, and When they are got together, let the Form of the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Conditions be read, Which runs to this Effect. That you are to Drink up the Sea by such a Certain Time, or to forfeit your House and Land, upon Such or Such a Consideration. When This is done, call for a Great Glass, and let it be filled with <hi>Sea-Water,</hi> in the Sight of the Whole Multitude: Hold it up then in your Hand, and say as Follows. <hi>You have heard Good People, what I have Undertaken to do, and upon what Penalty if I do not go Through with it. I confess the Agreement, and the Matter of Fact as you have heard it; and I am now about to drink up the Sea; not the Rivers that run into't. And therefore let All the Inlets be Stopt, that there be Nothing but pure Sea left me to drink, And I am now ready to perform my part of the Agreement, But for any drinking of the Rivers, There is nothing Of that in the Contract.</hi> The People found it so clear a Case, That they did not only agree to the Reason and Justice of <hi>Xanthus</hi>'s Cause, but hissed his Adversary out of the Field; Who in the Conclusion made a Publique Acknowledgment, that <hi>Xanthus</hi> was the Wiser and Better Man of the Two; But desired the Contract might be made voyd, and offer'd to Submit Himselfe further to such Arbitrators as <hi>Xanthus</hi> Himselfe should direct. <hi>Xanthus</hi> was so well pleased with the Character his Adversary had given him, of a Wise Man, That All was Passed over, And a finall End made of the Dispute. <hi>Plutarch</hi> makes this to have be'n the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>Bias.</hi>

               <p>IN the days of <hi>Aesop,</hi> The World was mightily addicted to <hi>Augury;</hi> that is to say, to the Gathering of <hi>Omens</hi> from the Cry and Flight of <hi>Birds.</hi> Upon this Account it was, that <hi>Xanthus</hi> one Day sent <hi>Aesop</hi> into the Yard, and bad him look well about him. If you see <hi>Two Crows</hi> (says he) you'l have <hi>good Luck</hi> after it, but if you should Chance to spye <hi>One Crow Single,</hi> 'tis a <hi>Bad Omen,</hi> and some Ill will betide you. <hi>Aesop</hi> stept out and came Immediately back again, and told his Master that he had seen <hi>Two Crows.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Xanthus</hi> went out himself, and finding but <hi>One,</hi> (for the Other was flown away) he fell Outragiously upon <hi>Aesop</hi> for making Sport with him, And order'd him to be sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lash'd for't, but just as they were stripping him for the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, In comes One to Invite <hi>Xanthus</hi> abroad to Supper. Well Master, says <hi>Aesop,</hi> and where's the Credit of your <hi>Augury</hi> Now? When, I that saw <hi>Two</hi> Crows, am to be <hi>beaten like</hi> a Dog, and You that saw but <hi>One,</hi> are going to <hi>make merry</hi> with your Friends? The Reason and Quickness of this Reflexion, Pacified the Master for the Present, and saved the Poor Fellow a sound Whipping.</p>

Well, says <hi>Aesop,</hi> let me see a Little If I can Uncypher it. And so after lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Things and Things together a While, Master, says he, What will you give me, If I find you out a Pott of Hidden Treasure now? One <hi>Halfe</hi> of it, says <hi>Xanthus,</hi> and your <hi>Liberty.</hi> So <hi>Aesop</hi> fell to Digging, a Matter of four Yards from the Stone that had the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription; and there found a Pott of Gold which he took up and Delivered to his Master; and Claimed his Promise. Well, says

                  <hi>Xanthus,</hi> I'le be as good as my Word; but you must first shew me how you came to know there was Treasure, by the Inscription: for I had rather be Master of That Secret, then of the very Gold it self. <hi>Aesop</hi> Innocently opened the whole Matter to him.

Come Sir, says <hi>Aesop,</hi> (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that his Master play'd Fast and Loose with him) To deal freely with you, This Treasure belongs to King <hi>Dionysius.</hi> How do you know that? says <hi>Xanthus.</hi> Why by the very Inscription, says <hi>Aesop:</hi> for in That Sence, α stands for <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>CAP. XIV. Aesop</hi> Expounds upon an Augury, and is made Free.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>AESOP</hi> had thus far born All the Indignities of a Tedious Slavery, with the Constancy of a Wise Man, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either Vanity or Abjection of Mind. He was not Ignorant how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of his own Value; Neither did he Neglect any honest Way or Occasion of Advancing his Name and his Credit in the World; as in One Particular Instance among the <hi>Samians,</hi> on a Strange Thing that happened There upon a Very Solemn Day. The Ring, it seems, that had the Towne-Seale upon't was lay'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in Sight, Where an Eagle could come at it; She took it up in the Aire, and dropt it into the Bosome of a Slave. The <hi>Samians</hi> took this for a Fore-boding, that Threat'ned some dismal Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the State, and in a general Consternation They presently called a Councell of their Wise Men; and <hi>Xanthus</hi> in the first Place, to give their Opinions upon This Mysterious Accident. They were All at a Loss what to Think on't; only <hi>Xanthus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired some few Days time for further Consideration. Upon This, he betook himselfe to his Study, and the More he Beat his Brains about it, the further he found himselfe from any hope of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding The Secret. This put him into a deep Melancholly; which made <hi>Aesop</hi> very Importune, and Impatient, to know the Cause of it; with Assurances, That he would serve his Master in The Affair, Whatever it was, to the Uttermost of his Power. <hi>Xanthus</hi> hereupon laid the Whole Matter before him, and told him in Conclusion, that he was not only lost in his Reputation, but in Danger to be Torn to Pieces by the Rabble. When <hi>Aesop</hi> found how the Case stood, Never Trouble your Head any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, says he, Do but follow my Advice, and I'le bring you off as well now as ever I did before. When you Appear to Morrow to give in your Answer, I would have you Speak to the People after this Manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I need not tell your Wisdoms, That</hi> so Many Heads so Many Minds, <hi>and so many severall Men, so many severall Conceptions of Things; Nay and further, That every severall Art, or Profession requires a Distinct Faculty or Disposition, that is more or less Peculiar to it self. It is the Custom of the World for People in All Cases where They are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ignorant or Doubtfull, to Repair to Men that have the Reputation of</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:66024:19"/>
                  <hi>Philosophers, for Councell and Satisfaction. But this, under favour, is a Great Mistake; for it is with Philosophers, as it is, I say, with other Arts and Professions that have their Functions a part the One from the Other. Wisdom, 'tis true, may be called properly enough the Knowledge of Things Divine and Humane, but will you therefore expect that a Philosopher should do the Office of a Shoomaker or a Barber, because the Trades are conversant about Humane Things? No No Gentlemen, a Man may be a Great Philosopher without any Skill at All in the Handling of the Awl, or the Razor. But if the Question were Concerning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life and Manners, the Nature of Things Celestial or Terrestrial; The Duties that we owe to God or Man; you could not do better then repair to Philosophers for satisfaction. But for reading upon Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies; or Commenting upon the Flights of Birds, or the Entrails of Beasts, These are Things quite Beside the Philosophers Business. If there be any thing you doubt of that falls under the Cognizance of Philosophy, I am ready to serve you in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I should not Presume to name a Servant; Neither Perchance would you think fit to make use of one; If the Necessity of your present Distress, were not a very Competent and Reasonable Excuse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here's your Speech, says <hi>Aesop;</hi> and your Credit sav'd whether They'l hear me or Not. If they send for me, The Honour will be yours, in Case I Deliver my self to their Liking, and the Disgrace will be Mine then if I Miscarry. His Master was pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond Measure with the Advice, but he did not as yet Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Whether it Tended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xanthus</hi> Presented himselfe Early the next Morning before the Councell, Where he Dilated Upon The Matter according to his Instructions, and so referr'd Them to his Servant for the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Difficulty. The People with one Voyce cry'd out <hi>Where is he? Why does he not Appear? Why has not his Master Brought him along with him?</hi> In short, <hi>Aesop</hi> was Immediately fetch'd into the Court, and at the very First Sight of him, They All burst out a Laughing by Consent. This Fellow, says one, may have Skill perhaps in Divining, but he has Nothing that's Humane about him. Another asked Where he was Born, and whether or no Blocks had the Faculty of Speech in his Country. <hi>Aesop,</hi> upon This, Address'd himselfe to the Councell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You have here before ye,</hi> (says <hi>Aesop</hi>) <hi>an Ungracious Figure of a Man, which in truth is not a Subject for your Contempt, Nor is it a Reasonable Ground for your Despaire, upon the Matter in Question. One</hi>

                  <hi>Wise Man values Another for his Understanding, not for his Beauty; Beside that the Deformity of my Person is no Incapacity at All as to your Business. Did you never tast Delicious drink out of an Ill Look'd Vessell? or did you never drink Wine that was Vapid, or Eager, out of a Vessell of Gold? 'Tis Sagacity and Strength of Reason that you have Occasion for, not the force of Robust Limbs, nor the Delicacies of Colour and Proportion. Wherefore I must Beseech ye not to Iudge of My Mind by my Body, nor to Condemn me Unheard.</hi> Upon this, they All cry'd out to him, If he had any thing to say for the Common Good, That he would speak it. <hi>With your favour,</hi> says he, <hi>It is for that End I presume, that ye have called me hither, and it is with a Great Zeal for your Service, that I stand now before ye: But when I consider the Weight of the Matter in hand, and the Office That I am now to Perform, it will as little stand with your Honors Perhaps, to take the Opinion of a Slave into your Councells and Debates, as it will with my Condition to offer it. Beside the Risque I run of my Masters Displeasure upon the Event. But All This may yet be Obviated, my Fears secured, my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty gratify'd, and your own Dignity preserved, only by making me a Freeman before hand, to Qualify me for the Function.</hi> They All said it was a Most Reasonable Thing, and presently Treated about the Price of his Liberty, and order'd the <hi>Quaestors</hi> to pay down the Mony. When <hi>Xanthus</hi> saw that the thing must be done, He could not Decently stand Higgling about the Price; But making a Virtue of Necessity, he chose rather to <hi>Present Aesop</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, then to <hi>Sell</hi> him. The <hi>Samians</hi> took it very kindly, And <hi>Aesop</hi> was Presently <hi>Manumiz'd,</hi> and made a Citizen in Form, Proclaim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d a Freeman; and after this Ceremony, he Discoursed upon the Subject of the Portent as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I shall not need to tell so many Wise and Knowing Men, that the Eagle is a Royal Bird, and signifies a Great King; that the Dropping of the Ring into the Bosom of a Slave that has no Power over himself, portends the Loss of Your Liberties, if you do not look to your selves in Time; And that some Potent Prince has a Design upon ye.</hi> This put the <hi>Samians</hi> all a-fire to hear the Issue of the Prediction. In some short time after there came Ambassadors from <hi>Croesus</hi> the King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to Demand a Tribute on the Behalfe of their Master, and Threat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ned the <hi>Samians</hi> with a Warr in Case of a Refusal. This Affair came to be Debated in the Councell, where the Majority was rather for Peace with Slavery, then for running the Risque of a Dispute; but they would not come to a Resolution yet, without first Consulting <hi>Aesop</hi> What They had best to do; Who gave Them his Thoughts upon't in Words to This Effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:66024:20"/>
                  <hi>Every Man in this World has Two Wayes before him, That is to say, first, The Way of Liberty, that's Narrow and Rugged at the Entrance, but plainer and Smoother still the further you go.</hi> Secondly, <hi>The Way of Servitude or Slavery, that seems to be Easie at first, but you'l find it afterwards to be full of Intolerable Difficulties.</hi> The <hi>Samians,</hi> upon These Words, Declared themselves Unanimously for Liberty, and that since they were at present Free, They would never make Themselves Slaves by their own Consent: So the Ambassadors Departed, and there was a War Denounced.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Croesus</hi> came to Understand the Resolution the <hi>Samians</hi> had taken, and how Inclinable they were to a Complyance, 'till <hi>Aesop,</hi> by the Power only of a few words, Diverted them from it, he Resolv'd to send for and Discourse with <hi>Aesop.</hi> So He made an Offer to the <hi>Samians,</hi> upon their sending <hi>Aesop</hi> to him, to put a Stop at present to the course of his Arms. When <hi>Aesop</hi> came to hear of their Proposition, he told them That he was not against their sending of him, Provided only that he might tell them One Story before he Left them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Old Time,</hi> (says he) <hi>when some Beasts talked better Sence then Many Men do now a days, there happened to be a Fierce War betwixt the Wolves and the Sheep, And the Sheep, by the help of the Dogs, had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Better on't. The Wolves, upon This, offer'd the Sheep a Peace, on Condition only that they might have their Dogs for Hostages, The Silly credulous Sheep agreed to't, and as soon as ever they had parted with the Dogs, The Wolves brake in upon them, and Destroy'd them at pleasure.</hi> See <hi>Fab.</hi> 45.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Samians</hi> quickly smelt out the Moral of this Fable, and cry'd out, One and All, that they would not part with <hi>Aesop:</hi> But this did not hinder <hi>Aesop</hi> however from putting himself abord, and taking a Passage for <hi>Lydia</hi> with the Ambassadors.</p>

               <p>IMmediately Upon <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Arrival in <hi>Lydia,</hi> he Presented himselfe before the King, who looking upon him with Contempt, Hatred, and Indignation; Is This a Man says he, to hinder the King of <hi>Lydia</hi> from being Master of <hi>Samos?

               <p>
                  <hi>I am not here</hi> (says he, <hi>Great King</hi>) <hi>in the Quality of a Man that's Given up by his Country, or under the Compulsion of any force; But it is of my own Accord that I am now come to lay my selfe at your Majesties feet, and with this only Request, that you will vouchsafe me the Honour of your Royal Eare, and Patience but for a few words.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>There was a Boy hunting of Locusts, and he had the Fortune to take a Grasshopper. She found he was about to kill her, and Pleaded after this Manner for her Life. Alas (says she) I never did any Body an Injury, and never had it either in my Will or in my Power to do't. All my Business is my Song; and what will you be the Better for my Death? The Youth's Heart relented and he set the Simple Grasshopper at Liberty.</q>
               <p>Your Majesty has now that Innocent Creature before you: There's Nothing that I can pretend to <hi>but my Voyce, which I have ever employ'd so far as in me Lay, to the Service of Mankind.</hi> The King was so Tenderly moved with the Modesty and Prudence of the Man, That he did not only give him his Life, but bad him ask any thing further that he had a Mind to, and it should be Granted him. Why then, says <hi>Aesop,</hi> (with that Veneration, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Respect that the Case required) I do most humbly implore your Majesties favour for my Country-Men the <hi>Samians.</hi> The King Granted him his Request, and Confirmed it under his Seale; Beside that the Piety of making that Petition his Choice, was a further Recommendation of him to his Royal Kindness and Esteem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aesop,</hi> soon after This, returned to <hi>Samos</hi> with the News of the Peace, where he was Wellcomed with All the Instances of Joy and Thankfulness Imaginable; Insomuch that they Erected a Statue for him, with an Inscription upon it, in Honour of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. From <hi>Samos</hi> he returned afterwards to <hi>Croesus,</hi> for whose Sake he Composed several of <hi>Those Apologues</hi> that Pass in the World to This Day under his Name. His Fancy lay extremely to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66024:21"/>
but above All other Places, he had the Greatest Mind to see <hi>Babylon:</hi> To which End he got Letters of Recommendation from <hi>Croesus</hi> to the King there: who, according to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> was a Friend, and an Ally of <hi>Croesus</hi>'s, and his Name, <hi>Labynetus;</hi> not <hi>Lycerus,</hi> as <hi>Planudes</hi> has Handed it down to us upon a Great Mistake. But his Curiosity led him first to pass through <hi>Greece,</hi> for the sake of the <hi>Seven VVise Men,</hi> whose Reputation was at That Time Famous All over the World. He had the Good Hap in his Travels to find them at <hi>Corinth,</hi> together with <hi>Anacharsis,</hi> and several of their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and Disciples, Where they were All Treated by <hi>Periander</hi> at a <hi>Villa</hi> of his not far off the Towne. This Encounter was to the Common Satisfaction of the Whole Company; the Entertainment Philosophical, and Agreeable, and among other Discourses, they had some Controversy upon the Subject of Government; and which was the most Excellent Form: <hi>Aesop</hi> being still for <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> and the <hi>Rest</hi> for a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> He Travell'd thence, a while after into <hi>Asia,</hi> and so to <hi>Babylon,</hi> according to his first Intention.</p>

               <p>IT was the Fashion in those Days, for Princes to Exercise Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls of Skill in the Putting and Resolving of Riddles, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate Questions; and He that was the Best at the Clearing or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying of Knotty Difficulties carry'd the Prize. <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Faculty lay notably that way, and render'd him so serviceable to the King, that it brought him both Reputation and Reward. It was his Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to have No Children, for the Comfort and Support of his Old Age; So that with the Kings Consent, he Adopted a young Man, who was Well Born, and Ingenious enough, but Poor; His Name was <hi>Ennus. Aesop</hi> took as much care of his Institution, as if he had been his own Child, and Train'd him up in those Principles of Vertue and Knowledge that might most probably ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him Great and Happy. But there's no working upon a Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious and Perverse Nature, by Kindness and Discipline, and tis time lost to think of Mastering so Incurable an Evil: So that <hi>Ennus,</hi> after the Manner of other Wicked Men, heaping One Villany up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

another, Counterfeits his Fathers Name and Hand to Certain Letters, wherein he Promises his Assistance to the Neighbour Princes against <hi>Labynetus.</hi> These Letters <hi>Ennus</hi> carry's to the King, and Charges his Father with Treason, though in Appearance, with All the trouble and unwillingness that was possible, Only a Sense of his Duty to his King and to his Country, swallow'd up All other Respects of Reverence and Modesty that a Son ows to a Father. The King took All These Calumnies for Instances of <hi>Ennus</hi>'s Affections to him, without the Least Suspition of any Fraud in the Matter: So that without any further Enquiry, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Aesop</hi> to be put to Death. The Persons to whom the Care of his Execution was Committed, being well Assured of his Innocence, and of the Kings Ungovernable Passions, took him out of the way, and Gave it out that he was Dead. Some few Dayes after this, there came Letters to <hi>Labynetus</hi> from <hi>Antasis</hi> the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> wherein <hi>Labynetus</hi> was Desired by <hi>Amasis</hi> to send him a certain Architect that could raise a Tower that should Hang in the Aire, and likewise Resolve All Questions. <hi>Labynetus</hi> was at a Great Loss what answer to return, And the Fierceness of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure against <hi>Aesop</hi> being by This time somewhat Abated, he began to Enquire after him with Great Passion, and would often Profess, That if the Parting with One halfe of his Kingdom could bring him to Life again, he would Give it. <hi>Hermippus</hi> and Others that had kept him out of the Way, told the King upon the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of This, That <hi>Aesop</hi> was yet Alive; so They were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to bring him forth; which they did, in All the Beastlyness he had Contracted in the Prison. He did no sooner Appear, but he made his Innocence so manifest, that <hi>Labynetus</hi> in Extreme Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure and Indignation, commanded the False Accuser to be put to Death with most Exquisite Torments; But <hi>Aesop,</hi> after All this, Interceded for him, and Obtained his Pardon, upon a Charitable Presumption, that the Sence of so Great a Goodness and Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would yet work upon him. <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells this Story of <hi>Cambyses</hi> the Son of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Croesus,</hi> and with what Joy <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byses</hi> received <hi>Croesus</hi> again, after he was supposed to be put to death by his own Order; but Then it Varies in This, that he Caused Those to be put to Death, that were to have seen the Execution done, for not Observing his Commands.</p>

               <p>These, or such as these, were the Lessons that <hi>Aesop</hi> read daily to his Son; but so far was he from mending upon Them, that he grew Every Day worse and worse, shewing that it is not in the power of Art or Discipline to Rectify a Perverse Nature, or (as <hi>Euripides</hi> says) to <hi>Make a Man Wise that has no Soul.</hi> But however, according to <hi>Neveletus,</hi> he came soon after to be Touched in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science for his Barbarous Ingratitude, and Dyed in a Rageing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse for what he had done.</p>

                  <hi>CAP. XVIII. Aesop</hi>'s Voyage to <hi>Delphos;</hi> his Barbarous Usage There, and his Death.</head>
               <p>WHEN <hi>Aesop</hi> had allmost taken the Whole Tower of <hi>Greece,</hi> he went to <hi>Delphos,</hi> either for the <hi>Oracle</hi> sake, or for the sake of the <hi>VVise Men</hi> that Frequented the Place. But when he came thither, he found Matters to be quite otherwise then he expected, and so far from deserving the Reputation they had in the World for Piety and Wisdom, that he found them Proud, and Avaritious, and Hereupon Deliver'd his Opinion of Them under this Fable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I find</hi> (says he) <hi>the Curiosity that brought me Hither, to be much the Case of People at the Sea side, that see something come Hulling toward them a great way off at Sea, and take it at first to be some Mighty Matter, but upon Driving Nearer and Nearer the Shore, it proves at last to be only a heap of VVeeds and Rubbish.</hi> See <hi>Fab.</hi>

               <p>The Magistrates of the Place took Infinite Offence at this Liberty and presently enter'd into a Conspiracy against him to take away his Life, for fear he should Give them the same Character else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in his Travells, that he had done there upon the Place. It was not so Safe they thought, nor so Effectual a Revenge to make him away in private; but if they could so contrive it, as to bring him to a shamefull End, under a Form of Justice, it would better answer their Business and Design. To Which Purpose they caused a Golden Cup to be secretly convey'd into his Baggage, when he was packing up to Depart. He was no sooner out of the Towne upon his Journy, But Immediately Pursued and taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way by Officers, and Charged with <hi>Sacrilege. Aesop</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd the Matter, and Laughed at them All for a Company of Mad Men; But upon the Searching of his Boxes, they took the Cup, and shew'd it to the People, Hurrying him away to Prison in the Middle of his Defence. They brought him the Next Day into the Court, Where Notwithstanding the Proof of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, as clear as the Day, he was Condemned to Dye; and his Sentence was to be Thrown Head-long from a Rock, Down a Deep Precipice. After his Doom was past, he Prevailed upon Them, with much ado to be heard a few Words, and so told them the Story of the Frog and the Mouse, as it stands in the Fable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:66024:23"/>This wrought nothing upon the Hearts of the <hi>Delphians,</hi> but as they were Bawling at the Executioner, to Dispatch and do his Office, <hi>Aesop</hi> on a Sudden gave them the Slip, and Fled to an Altar hard by there, in hopes that the Religion of the Place might have Protected him, but the <hi>Delphians</hi> told him, that the Altars of the Gods were not to be any Sanctuary to those that Robbed their Temples; Whereupon he took Occasion to tell them the Fable of the <hi>Eagle</hi> and the <hi>Beetle</hi> to this Following Effect, As it stands in the Book, <hi>Num.</hi> 378.</p>
               <p>Now says <hi>Aesop</hi> (after the telling of this Fable) you are not to Flatter your Selves that the Prophaners of Holy Altars, and the Oppressors of the Innocent, shall ever Escape Divine Vengeance. This Enraged the Magistrates to such a Degree, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Officers Immediately to take <hi>Aesop</hi> from the Altar, and Dispatch him away to his Execution. When <hi>Aesop</hi> found that Neither the Holyness of the Place, nor the Clearness of his Innocence was Sufficient to Protect him, and that he was to fall a Sacrifice to Subornation and Power, he gave them yet one Fable more as he was upon the Way to Execution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There was an Old Fellow</hi> (says he) <hi>that had spent his Whole Life in the Countrey without ever seeing the Towne, he found himselfe Weak and Decaying, and Nothing would serve, but his Friends must needs shew him the Towne once before he Dyed. Their Asses were very well Acquainted with the Way, and so they caused them to be made Ready, and turned the Old Man and the Asses Loose, without a Guide to try their Fortune. They were overtaken Upon the Road by a Terrible Tempest, so that what with the Darkness, and the Violence of the Storm, the Asses were Beaten out of their Way, and Tumbled with the Old Man into a Pit, where he had only time to Deliver his Last Breath with This Exclamation. Miserable Wretch that I am to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd, since Dye I must, by the Basest of Beasts; by Asses. And that's my Fate now, in suffering by the Hands of a Barbarous Sottish People, that Understand Nothing either of Humanity or Honour; and Act Contrary to the Tyes of Hospitality and Iustice. But the Gods will not suffer my Blood to lye Unrevenged, and I doubt not, but that in Good Time the Iudgment of Heaven will give you to Understand your Wickedness by your Punishment.

                  <p>Now, with favour of the Ancients, this Fable seems to me, rather to hold forth an Emblem of <hi>Industry</hi> and <hi>Moderation.</hi> The <hi>Cock</hi> lives by his <hi>honest Labor,</hi> and maintains his Family out of it; His Scraping upon the <hi>Dunghill,</hi> is but Working in his <hi>Calling:</hi> The <hi>precious Stone</hi> is only a gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Temptation</hi> that Fortune throws in his way to divert him from his Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness and his Duty.

Nay, that very La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidary himself, with a coming Stomach, and in the <hi>Cock</hi>'s place, would have made the <hi>Cock</hi>'s Choice.

                  <p>When Innocence is to be oppress'd by Might, Arguments are foolish things; nay, the very Merits, Virtues, and good Offices of the Person ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd, are improv'd to his Condemnation: As the Industry and Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Cock</hi> here, in the calling of People out of their Beds to work when 'tis time to rise, is turn'd upon him as a Crime.

The <hi>Lamb</hi> it self shall be made malicious. And what is this now, but the lively Image of a perverse Reason of State, set up in opposition to Truth and Justice; but under the August Name and Pretence, however of Both?

Decency of Religious Worship shall be made Superstition; Tenderness of Conscience shall be call'd Phanaticism, Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and Faction; and the very Articles of the Christian Faith shall be condemn'd for Heresie.

                  <p>THIS is the Case of Unreasonable, and Insatiable Desires; as in Love, Ambition, and the Like; where People are still reaching at More and More, till they lose All in the Conclusion.</p>
                  <p>There are more Meanings of <hi>Substance</hi> and <hi>Shadow;</hi> of Mistaking One for T'other; and Losing All by Chopping at More; than the Bare Sense and Letter of the <hi>Dog,</hi> the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Image</hi> here in the Fable. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these Heads are comprehended all Inordinate Desires, Vain Hopes, and Miserable Disappointments. What shall we say of those that spend their Days in Gaping after Court-Favours and Preferments; Servile Flatteries; and Slavish Attendances? That Live, and Entertain themselves upon Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings in Vision? (For Fair Words and Promises, are no more than Empty Appearances) What is all This, but Sacrificing a Man's Honour, Integrity, Liberty, Reason, Body, Soul, Fortune, and All, for <hi>Shadows?</hi> We place our Trust in Things that have no Being; Disorder our Minds, Discompose our Thoughts, Entangle our Estates, and Sell our selves, in One Word, for Bubbles. How wretched is the Man that does not know when he's Well, but passes away the Peace and Comfort of his Life, for the Gratifying of a Fantastical Appetite, or Humour! Nay, and he Misses his Aim, even in That too, while he Squanders away his Interest, and Forfeits his Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the Pursuit of One Vanity after Another. Ambition is a Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that reaches from Earth to Heaven; and the First Round is but so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inches in a Man's way toward the Mounting of All the Rest. He's never well till he's at the Top, and when he can go no Higher, he must either Hang in the Air, or Fall; For in This Case, he has nothing above him to Aspire to, nor any Foot-Hold left him to come down by. Every Man has what's Sufficient, at Hand, and in Catching at more than he can carry away, he loses what he Had. Now there's Ingratitude, as well as Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, in All these Rambling and Extravagant Motions: Beside, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice is always Beggerly; for He that Wants, has as good as Nothing. The Desire of More and More, rises by a Natural Gradation to Most, and after that, to All; Till in the Conclusion we find our selves Sick and Weary of All that's possible to be had; sollicitous for something else, and then when we have spent our Days in the Quest of the Meanest of Things, and at the

Feet too of the Worst of Men, we find at the bottom of the Account, that all the Enjoyments under the Sun, are not worth Struggling for. What can be Vainer now, than to Lavish out our Lives and Fortunes in the Search and Purchase of Trifles; and at the same time to lye Carking for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Goods of this World, and in a restless Anxiety of Thought for what's to come.

What's a Man's Contending with Insuperable Difficulties, but the Rolling of <hi>Sisiphus's Stone</hi> up the Hill, which is sure before-hand, to Return upon him again?

               <p>A <hi>Wolf</hi> had got a Bone in's Throat, and could think of no better Instrument to Ease him of it, than the Bill of a <hi>Crane;</hi> so he went and Treated with a <hi>Crane</hi> to help him out with it, upon Condition of a very considerable Reward for his pains. The <hi>Crane</hi> did him the Good Office, and then claim'd his Promise. Why how now Impudence! (says t'other) Do you put your Head into the Mouth of a <hi>Wolf,</hi> and then, when y'ave brought it out again safe and sound, do you talk of a Reward? Why Sirrah, you have your Head again, and is not that a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Recompence?</p>

                  <p>One Good Turn they say requires another: But yet He that has to do with Wild Beasts (as some Men are No Better) and comes off with a Whole Skin, let him Expect No Other Reward.</p>

                  <p>THIS Fable will bear Divers Morals; as First, That it is but Due Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to be Thankful to our Preservers. Secondly, The <hi>Crane</hi>'s Good Fortune can hardly Excuse his Facility. And then the <hi>Crane</hi> did Ill again to Insist upon a Reward; for a Good Office pays it self; neither was he reasonably to Expect that so Perfidious a Creature should keep Touch with him. Thirdly, Though the <hi>Wolf</hi> was to blame for not making Good his Promise, there is yet in Equity a kind of a Reward, in not Chopping off his Head when he had it at Mercy.</p>
                  <p>The Case of the <hi>Crane</hi> here, is a Case of Conscience; for 'tis a Nice Business to Determine, how far Wicked Men in their Distresses <hi>May</hi> be Reliev'd; How far they <hi>Ought</hi> to be Reliev'd; and to what Degree of Loss, Labor, and Difficulty, a Sober, a Wise, and a Good Man may In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose to their Redress. He may <hi>Give;</hi> he may <hi>Lend,</hi> he may <hi>Venture,</hi> so far as Generosity and Good Nature shall prompt him; provided always that he go no farther than the Conscience of the Cause, or of the Action will Warrant him. A Man is at <hi>Liberty,</hi> 'tis true, to do many Kind and Brave Offices, which he is not <hi>Bound</hi> to do: And if the Largeness of his Heart shall carry him beyond the Line of Necessary Prudence, we may reckon upon it only as a more Illustrious Weakness.</p>
                  <p>Here is a Fiction of One <hi>Crane</hi> that scap'd, that there might not want One Instance of an Encouragement to a Dangerous Act of Charity: But this One Instance is not yet sufficient to justifie the making a Common Practice of it, upon the same Terms. 'Tis possible for One Blot not to be Hit; or to be Over-seen perhaps. And so 'tis as possible for One Ill Man, either not to think of the Mischief he could do, or to slip the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it; but such a Deliverance however, is a Thing to Thank Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for, without standing upon a Reward for the Service. The Bone in the Throat of the <hi>Wolf,</hi> may be Understood of any sort of Pinch, or Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, either in Body, Liberty, or Fortune. How many do we see Daily, Gaping and Struggling with Bones in their Throats, that when they have gotten them drawn out, have Attempted the Ruine of their Deliverers! The World, in short, is full of Practices and Examples to Answer the Intent of this Fable; and there are Thousands of Consciences that will be Touch'd with the Reading of it, whose Names are not written in their Foreheads.</p>

                  <p>HE that takes an Ungrateful Man into his Bosom, is well nigh sure to be Betray'd; and it is no longer Charity, but Folly, to think of Obliging the Common Enemies of Mankind. But 'tis no New Thing for good Natur'd Men to meet with Ungrateful Returns. Wherefore Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, Charities, and Kindnesses, should be well Weigh'd and Examin'd, as to the Circumstances of Time, Place, Manner, Person, and Proportion, before we Sign and Seal. A Man had much better take a <hi>Tyger</hi> into his Grounds, than a <hi>Snake</hi> into his Bosom. How many Examples have we seen with our own Eyes, of Men that have been pick'd up and Reliev'd out of Starving Necessities, without either Spirit, or Strength to do Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, who in requital have afterwards conspir'd against the Life, Honor, and Fortune of their Patrons and Redeemers. Did ever any of these Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Snakes</hi> lose their Venom for lying under some Temporary Incapacity of Using it? Will they be ever the less Dangerous and Malicious, when Warmth shall bring them to themselves again; because they were once Frozen and Benumm'd with Cold? The very Credulity Encourages an Abuse, where the Will to do Mischief only waits for the Power, and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of putting it in Execution. Facility makes the Innocent a Prey to the Crafty: Wherefore it is highly necessary for the One to know how far, and to Whom he Trusts; and for the Other to understand what he is to Trust to.

Why will you lie Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and Pinching your self in such a Lonesome Starving Course of Life as This is; when tis but going to Town along with Me; to Enjoy all the Pleasures, and Plenty that Your Heart can Wish? This was a Temptation the <hi>Country Mouse</hi> was not able to Resist; so that away they Trudg'd together, and about Midnight got to their Journeys End.

                  <p>THE Design of This Fable is to set forth the Advantages of a Private Life, above Those of a Publick; which are certainly very Great, if the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of Innocence, Security, Meditation, Good Air, Health, and sound Sleeps, without the Rages of Wine, and Lust, or the Contagion of Idle Examples, can make them so: For Every Thing there, is Natural and Gracious. There's the Diversion of All Healthful Exercises for the Body; The Entertainment of the Place, and of the Rivers, without any Base Interest to Corrupt, either the Virtue, or the Peace of our Lives. He that's a Slave in the Town is a kind of a Petty Prince in the Country. He loves his Neighbours, without Pride, and lives in Charity with the Whole World. All that he sees is his Own, as to the Delight of it, without Envying the Prosperity. His Doors are not Troubled with either Dunns, or Fools, and he has the Sages of All Times in his Cabinet for his Companions. He lives to Himself as well as to the World, without Brawles or Quarrels, of any sort whatsoever. He sees No Bloody Murders; He hears No Blasphemous Execrations; He lives free from the Plagues of Jealousie and Envy: And This is the Life in fine, that the Greatest, and the Wisest Men in the World, Have, or would have made Choice of, if Cares and Business had not Hinder'd them from so Great a Blessing.</p>
                  <p>'Tis against Common Justice to pass Sentence without hearing Both sides: And the Only way to come to a True Estimate upon the Odds betwixt a Publick and a Private Life, is to Try Both. Virtue is only Glorious in the Native Simplicity of it, and while it holds no Communication with Interest, Fancy, Sense, or Ornament: Wherefore <hi>Aesop</hi> has done Wisely to cast the Issue of the Question upon the Experiment, <hi>Far from Iupiter</hi> (says the <hi>Adage</hi>) <hi>far from the Thunder.</hi> What signifies the Splendor, and the Luxury of Courts, considering the Slavish Attendances, the Invidious Competitions, and the Mortal Disappointments that go along with it. The Frowns of Princes, and the Envy of those that Judge by Hearsay, or Appearance; without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reason or Truth! To say nothing of the Innumerable Temptations, Vices, and Excesses, of a Life of Pomp, and Pleasure. Let a man but set the Pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Palate against the Surfeits of Gluttony and Excess, The Starving of his Mind against a Pamper'd Carcass; The Restless Importunities of Tale-bearers and Back Friends, against Fair Words and Professions only from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66024:31"/>
the Teeth outward: Let him, I say, but set the One in Ballance against the Other, and he shall find himself Miserable, even in the very Glutt of his Delights. To say All in a Word; Let him but set the Comforts of a Life spent in Noise, Formality, and Tumult, against the Blessings of a Retreat with Competency and Freedom, and then Cast up his Account.</p>
                  <p>What Man then, that is not stark Mad, will Voluntarily Expose himself to the Imperious Brow-beatings and Scorns of Great Men! to have a Dagger struck to his Heart in an Embrace; To be torn to pieces by Calumny, nay to be a Knave in his own Defence! for the Honester the Worse, in a Vicious Age, and where 'tis a Crime not to be like the Company. Men of that Character are not to be Read, and Understood by their Words, but by their Interests; their Promises and Protestations are no longer Binding than while they are Profitable.

                  <p>THIS Fable shews us the Danger and the Nature of Flattery. It calls Good Things by Ill Names, and Ill by Good; but it will never be out of Credit, so long as there are Knaves to Give it, and Fools to Take it. It is never more Pernicious than in the Courts of Great Princes, because a good deal of it looks like Duty; as in private Cases, it carries a face of Friendship. The way to Rise is to Please, and whatever is gotten by't, comes by Treachery. 'Tis a Design that endangers both Body, Soul, and Estate; and not One Man of a Million that's Proof against it. But Great and Good Men will rather look for their Character in the Writings and Precepts of the Philosophers, than in the <hi>Hyperboles</hi> of their Flatterers.

The two main Ends of Flattery, are Profit, or Safety, though there are many others too that are less Principal; but in some respect or other, Reducible to these Heads. The One is too Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and the Other too Servile, for a man of Worth. There are also several sorts and degrees of it under this Division; and divers ways of Address and Application. But <hi>Flattery</hi> is <hi>Flattery</hi> still, and the Moral extends to All.</p>

The Measures, and the Artifices of it are Many, and in divers Cases so like Sincerity, that what betwixt Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, and the Nature of the Thing, it looks, in truth, like a Virtue, and a Duty; that is to say, where it is so manag'd, as to be rather Instructive than pussing up. As for Example, for a body to say, [<hi>This or That was Wisely foreseen,</hi>] Or [<hi>You intend, I presume, to go This or That Way to Work:</hi>] and the like. Such an Insinuation as this is, carries the Force in it of a Tacite, and a prudent Advice; for it both serves to point out the Reason of the thing, and it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the Decency of that Respect which ought to go along with it. 'Tis a good Hint, the very suggesting of such or such a Precaution, though the consideration perhaps never came near the t' others Thought.

                  <p>It is the Parasites Act to cast himself into all Shapes that may sort with the Figure of his Patron, in what Post, Function, or Administration soever; and to frame the Air and Countenance of his Words, Looks, and Actions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, with a respect to his Power, Wisdom, Conduct, Bravery, Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, Justice, or what other Subject he thinks fit to treat upon. So that let him be never so Perfidious, Shallow, Rash, Timorous, Envious, Malicious, Proud, Covetous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a Little <hi>Court Holy-Water</hi> Washes off all Stains.

                  <p>A Prince that does not secure Friends to Himself while he is in Power and Condition to oblige them, must never expect to find Friends, when he is Old and Impotent, and no longer Able to do them any Good. If he Governs Tyrannically in his Youth, he will be sure to be Treated Contemptuously in his Age; and the Baser his Enemies are, the more Insolent, and Intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable will be the Affront.</p>

                  <p>This may serve for a Lesson to men in Power, that they Treasure up Friends in their Prosperity, against a time of Need; for He that does not Secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of a stock of Reputation in his Greatness, shall most Certainly fall Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pity'd in his Adversity: And the Baser his Enemies are, the more insupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able is the Insolence, and the forwarder will they be to Trample upon him.</p>
                  <p>The Case of this Miserable <hi>Old Lion</hi> may serve to put Great Men in mind, that the Wheele of Time, and of Fortune is still Rolling, and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are to lie down at last in the Grave with Common Dust: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any thing to support them in their Age, but the Reputation, Virtue and Conscience of a well spent Youth. Nay Age it self, is well-nigh sufficient to Deface every Letter and Action in the History of a Meritorious Life. For Old Services are Bury'd under the Ruines of an Old Carcass: But there are None yet that fall so Unpity'd; so Just, so Necessary, and so Grateful a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Rage and Scorn of the common People, as those that have rais'd themselves upon the Spoiles of the Publick: Especially when that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is Aggravated with a Wanton Cruelty, and with Blood and Rapine, for the very love of Wickedness. It is a kind of Arrogance, in such a case, to be Honest, where 'tis both a Fashion, and a Credit to be Other.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lion</hi> is here upon his Death-Bed; Not a Friend left him, nor so much as an Enemy, with either Fangs or Claws, that does not stand Gaping and Waiting for a Collop of him.

                  <p>There is Nothing so Little, but Greatness may come to Stand in need on't, and therefore Prudence and Discretion ought to have a place in Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, as well as in Piety and Justice. 'Tis <hi>Doing as we would be done by;</hi> and the Obligation is yet Stronger, when there is Gratitude, as well as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Good Nature in the Case. The Generosity of the <hi>Lion,</hi> and the Gratitude of the <hi>Mouse;</hi> The Power, the Dignity, and the Eminence of the One, and the Meanness of the Other; do all Concur to the making of this a very Instructive Fable. Who would have thought that Providence should ever have lay'd the Life of a <hi>Lion</hi> at the Mercy of a <hi>Mouse?</hi> But the Divine Wisdom that brings the Greatest Ends to pass by the most Despicable Means, Orders the Reward of Virtue, and the punishment of Vice, by Ways only known to it self, in token of an Approbation of the One, and a Dislike of the Other.</p>
                  <p>Here's a Recommendation of Clemency and Wisdom, Both in One; for the <hi>Lion,</hi> in sparing the Life of the <hi>Mouse,</hi> sav'd his Own; and has left us in this Fable, an Instance of a Grateful Beast, that will stand upon Record to the Confusion of many an Ungrateful Man; that is to say, against those that in their Prosperity forget the Friends, that to their Loss and Hazard, stood by and succour'd them in their Adversity. This is a Sin of so odious and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an Example, that it puts even Piety, and Gratitude it self out of Countenance. And then the Tenderness on the other side, is Matter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and ordinary Prudence, as well as of Virtue.

But 'tis not for a Wicked Life to trust to the Hazzards of an Uncertain State, and Disposition at the point of Death.

                  <p>THESE Fables are a Reproof to the Ungrateful Cruelty of those that will neither Forgive One Slip, nor Reward a Thousand Services, but take more Notice of a Particular Unlucky Accident, than of a General Laudable Practice. But One Stumble is enough to Deface the Character of an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Life. It is a Barbarous Inhumanity in Great Men to Old Servants, to make the Failings of Age to be a Crime, without allowing the Past Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Their Strength and Youth, to have been a Virtue. And This is found in Governments, as well as in Courts, and Private Families; with Masters and Mistresses, as well as in States.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a miserable Thing, when Faithful Servants fall into the hands of Insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and Unthankful Masters; Such as Value Services only by the Profit they bring them, without any regard to the Zeal, Faith, and Affections, of the Heart, and pay them with Blows, and Reproaches in their Age, for the Use, Strength and Industry of their Youth. Nay Humane Frailty it self is Imputed to them for a Crime, and they are Treated Worse than Beasts for not being More than Men. Here's an <hi>Old Drudging Curr</hi> turn'd off to Shift for Himself, for want of the very Teeth and Heels that he had lost in his <hi>Masters</hi> Service. Nay, if he can but come off for Starving, it passes for an Act of Mercy. Under These Circumstances, the Bare Sense of a Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is call'd Grumbling, and if a man does but make a Face upon the Boot, he's presently a Male-Content. It may be a Question now, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Wickedness, or the Imprudence of this Iniquity be the more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious; for over and above the Inhumanity, 'tis a Doctrine of Ill Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the <hi>Master</hi> Himself, to shew the World how Impossible a Thing it is for a Servant to Oblige and Please him: Nay, it is some sort of Temptation also to Impiety and Injustice, when Virtue and Duty come to be made Dangerous.</p>
                  <p>And yet it is not One <hi>Master</hi> perhaps of Twenty, all this while, that either directs, or takes Notice of These Indignities. It goes a Great Way, 'tis true, Barely to Permit them. One while perchance the Master is not Aware of what is done, and then in Other Cases, it may fall out Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be his Own Act, even against his Own Will: That is to say, when the Passions of Imperious, and Ill Natur'd Servants are Cover'd with the Name and Authority of their Patrons, in the Abuse of a Trust that was Plac'd in 'em for Honester, and for Nobler Ends. It is Congruous enough yet to Apply the Moral of This Fiction, rather to the Driver of the <hi>Asse,</hi> and to the Huntsman that Manag'd the Chase, than to the <hi>Master</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: But the <hi>Asse</hi> and <hi>Dog</hi> were Beaten however, for being <hi>Old,</hi> and spent, in Despite of All the Bonds and Instincts of Honour, Piety, and Good Nature.</p>

                  <p>'Tis the Intent of These Two Fables, to shew, that no People are so Miserable, but that at some Time or Other, in some Thing or Other, they have Reason to Account themselves Happy. And if they would but duly
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66024:38"/>
consider, how it is with many of their Neighbours, they would find it their Duty to be Thankful, that it is no Worse with Themselves. It is some Relief to the Miserable to shew them that there are Others yet more Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, and there is not any thing so Timerous, but something else is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of It. There are Those, 'tis True, that Die for the very Fear of Death, and Plunge themselves into Certain Misery, upon the Bare Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of it: But this comes rather from their Spleen, than their Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
                  <p>Since so it is, that Nature Provides for the Necessities of All Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and for the Well-Being of Every One in it's kind: And since it is not in the Power of any Creature to make it self Other than what by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence it was Design'd to be; what a Madness is it to Wish our selves Other than what we Are, and what we Must continue to Be: Since the Thing is Bounded, and the Whole Matter Pre-Determin'd. Every <hi>Atome</hi> of the Creation has its Place Assign'd: Every Creature has its Proper Figure, and there is No Disputing with Him that Made it so. <hi>Why have not I This?</hi> and <hi>why have not I That?</hi> are Questions for a Philosopher of <hi>Bedlam</hi> to ask; and we may as well Cavil at the Motions of the Heavens, the Vicissitude of Day and Night, and the Succession of the Seasons, as Expostulate with Providence upon any of the rest of Gods Works. The <hi>Asse</hi> would have <hi>Horns,</hi> and the <hi>Tinker</hi> would fain be in Bed with my <hi>Lady.</hi> The <hi>Ape</hi> would have a <hi>Tail;</hi> and why should not a <hi>Mountebank</hi> Complain that he is not a <hi>Minister of State or Iustice?</hi> But in short, the Poor, Wretched, Blind <hi>Mole</hi> puts in with her Doctrine to take up the Quarrel.</p>
                  <p>And what's the Case of the <hi>Hares</hi> now, but an Instance to Fortifie us against <hi>Panick</hi> Frights and Terrors, for Trivial Causes; where the Fears are a great deal more Terrible than the Dangers? In All These Cases, we fancy our selves much more Miserable than we Are, for want of taking a True Estimate of Things. We fly into Transports without Reason, and Judge of the Happiness, or Calamity, of Humane Life, by False Lights. A Strict Enquiry into the Truth of Matters will Help us in the One, and Comparison will set us Right in the Other. The <hi>Dogs</hi> and the <hi>Eagles</hi> Fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Hares;</hi> The <hi>Hares</hi> Frighted the <hi>Frogs,</hi> and the <hi>Frogs,</hi> Twenty to One, Frighted something else. This is according to the Course of the World, One Fears Another, and some body else is affraid of Him.</p>
                  <p>It may seem to be a kind of a Malicious Satisfaction, that One Man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> from the Misfortunes of Another. But the Philosophy of This Reflexion stands upon Another Ground; for Our Comfort does not Arise from Other peoples being Miserable, but from This Inference upon the Ballance, That we suffer only the Lot of Humane Nature: And as we are Happy or Miserable, compar'd with Others, So Other People are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable or Happy Compar'd with Us: By which Justice of Providence, we come to be Convinc'd of the Sin, and the Mistake of our Ingratitude. What would not a man give to be Eas'd of the Gout or the Stone? Or supposing an Incurable Poverty on the One Hand, and an Incurable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady on the Other; Why should not the Poor Man think himself Happier in his Rags, than the Other in his Purple? But the Rich Man Envies the Poor mans Health, without considering his Want; and the Poor Man Envies the Others Treasure without considering his Diseases. What's an Ill Name in the World to a Good Conscience within Ones self? And how much less Miserable upon the Wheel, is One man that is Innocent, than Another under the Same Torture that's Guilty. The Only Way

                  <p>AESOP has here given us the Fiction of a Case, wherein it may not be Amiss to repay an Abuse in its own Kind. The Mockery of the <hi>Fox</hi> was a Reproach, as it Hit the <hi>Stork</hi> on the Weak side; but That which was Rudeness, and Ill Nature in the Aggressor, was only a Monitory Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and a Discreet Sharpness in the Other.

                  <p>There's Nothing looks Sillier than a Crafty Knave Out-witted, and Beaten at his Own Play.

                  <head>REFLEXION.</head>
                  <p>WE are to Gather from hence, that people would never Envy the Pomp and Splendour of Greatness, if they did but consider, either the Cares and Dangers that go along with it, or the Blessings of Peace, and Security in a Middle Condition. No man can be truly Happy, who is not every Hour of his Life prepar'd for the worst that can befall him. Now This is a State of Tranquility never to be Attain'd, but by keeping perpetually in our Thoughts the Certainty of Death, and the Lubricity of Fortune; and by Delivering our selves from the Anxiety of Hopes and Fears.</p>
                  <p>It falls Naturally within the Prospect of This Fiction to Treat of the Wickedness of a Presumptuous Arrogance, the Fate that Attends it; The Rise of it; and the Means of either Preventing, or Suppressing it; The Folly of it; The Wretched and Ridiculous Estate of a Proud man, and the Weakness of That Envy that is Grounded upon the mistaken Happiness of Humane Life.</p>
                  <p>If a body may be Allow'd to Graft a <hi>Christian Moral</hi> upon a <hi>Pagan Fable,</hi> what was it but Pride and Arrogance that first threw <hi>Lucifer</hi> out of Heaven, and afterward, <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradise? [<hi>Ye shall be as Gods</hi>] was the Temptation; an Impotent, and a Presumptuous Affectation of Vain-Glory was the Sin; and a Malediction Temporal and Eternal was the Punishment. Now if the Charms of an Unruly Ambition could so far prevail upon the <hi>Angels</hi> Themselves in their Purity; and upon Mankind in a State of Innocence, how Strict a Guard ought <hi>we</hi> then to keep upon our selves, that are the Children of disobedience, and bring the seeds of This Deadly Vanity into the World with us in our very Veins?</p>
                  <p>It is highly Remarkable, that as Pride, and Envy are the Two Passions, that above All Others give the Greatest Trouble to the Sons of Men, so are they likewise the First Emotions of the Mind that we take Notice of in our Approaches to the Exercise of our Reason. They begin with us in the Arms of our Nurses, and at the very Breasts of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for what's the meaning of All the Little Wrangles and Contentions else, <hi>which Child shall be most made off; or which Baby shall have the Gayer Coat?</hi> So that These Affections are in truth, Connatural to us, and as We our selves grow up and Gather Strength, so do They; and pass In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibly from our Inclinations into our Manners. Now the Corruption must needs be Strong, where Humane Frailty strikes in so Early with it, and the Progress no less Mortal, where it is suffer'd to go on without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol: For what are all the Extravagances of the Leudest Life, but the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66024:44"/>
more Consummated Follies and Disorders, of either a Mis-taught, or a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Youth? Nay, what are All the Publick Outrages of a Destroying Tyranny and Oppression, but Childish Appetites let alone 'till they are grown Ungovernable? Beside, that it is Infinitely Easier to prevent Ill Habits, than to Master them; As the Choaking of the Fountain is the surest Way to Cut off the Course of the River. It should be Consider'd too that we have the seeds of Virtue in us, as well as of Vice; and when ever we take a Wrong Biass, 'tis not out of a Moral Incapacity to do Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but for want of a Careful Manage and Discipline, to set us Right at First.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore Children should be Moulded while their Tempers are yet Pliant and Ductile. As <hi>Pride,</hi> for the Purpose, that Arises from a False Opinion of Things, should be Obviated by Enforming their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. And so for <hi>Envy;</hi> the very Disposition to it is to be Sweeten'd, as Flowing from a Certain Froward Tincture of Ill Nature. (I speak This of the Malevolent, Canker'd Passion of Envy, which, in Effect, is Little or Nothing akin to the Silly Envy of the <hi>Ass</hi> here in the Fable.) In One word, Children should be season'd betimes, and Lesson'd into such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and Detestation of This Vice, as neither to practice it Themselves, nor to Approve it in Others. This is, in Little, the Foundation of a Virtuous Life, and there goes no more than Judging, and Acting A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, to the Character of a Good Philosopher, a Good Christian, and a Good Man: For to Know, and to Do, is the <hi>Compendium</hi> of our Duty,</p>
                  <p>It is not for Every Twatling Gossip yet, or some Empty Pedant, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to Undertake This Province; for it requires a Critical Nicety both of Wit, and of Judgment, to find out the <hi>Genius,</hi> or the Propensions of a Child, and to Distinguish betwixt the Impulses of Envy, and Those of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation: Betwixt the First Motions of a Churlish, and Impetuous Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and Those of a Serene Greatness, and Dignity of Mind. It is not, I say, for Every Common Eye, or Hand, to Divide so Accurately betwixt the Good, and the Evil, the Gracious, and the Perverse, as to Hit the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise <hi>Medium</hi> of Encouraging the One, without Discouraging the Other. And This Faculty of Discerning is not enough neither, without a Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Assiduity of Application. The Just Season of Doing Things must be Nick'd, and All Accidents Observ'd and Improv'd; for Weak Minds are to be as Narrowly Attended, as Sickly Bodies: To say Nothing of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Curiosity of the Operation, in the Forming of our Lives and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: And that not One man of Ten Thousand is Competently Qualify'd for the Office. Upon the Whole Matter there must be an Awe maintain'd on the One Hand, and at the same time, a Love and Reverence Preserv'd on the Other. And all this must be Order'd too with so Gentile a Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Address, that we may not Hazzard, either the Stifling, or the Quenching of Generous Inclinations, by bearing too Hard upon them, or the Licentiating of any thing that is Course and Vulgar, out of a foolish Facility or a Mistaken Pity. It is with our Passions, as it is with Fire and Water, they are <hi>Good Servants,</hi> but <hi>Bad Masters,</hi> and Subminister to the Best, and Worst of Purposes, at once. This is enough said, as to the Wickedness, and the Fate of Pride; The Source and Danger of it, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the only sure and Effectual Means of Remedy.</p>
                  <p>The Moral leads me in the Next place, to Consider the Folly of both the <hi>Horse</hi> and the <hi>Ass;</hi> The One, in Placing his Happiness upon any thing that could be Taken away; and the Other, in Envying that Mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Happiness, under the Abuse of the same Splendid Illusion and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.

What Signifies a Gay Furniture, and a Pamper'd Carcass; or any other Outward Appearance, without an Intrinsick Value of Worth and Virtue? VVhat signifies Beauty, Strength, Youth, Fortune, Embro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Furniture, Gawdy Bosses, or any of Those Temporary, and Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Satisfactions, that may be taken from us with the very next Breath we draw? What Assurance can any man have of a Possession that Every Turn of State, Every Puff of Air, Change of Humour, and the least of a Million of Common Casualties may Deprive him of? How many Huf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing Sparks have we seen in the World, that in the same day have been both the Idols, and the Sport and Scorn of the same Slaves and Fools? Nay, how many Emperours and Princes, that in the Ruff of All their Glory have been taken down from the Head of a Conquering Army, to the Wheel of the Victors Chariot? VVhere's that Advantage under the Sun that any but a Mad man would be Proud of? Or where's That Pride it self that any Mortal in his Right Wits, would not find Reason to be Ashamed of? Take it singly, and what is there More in't, than an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and an Unmanly <hi>Tympany,</hi> that Rises in a Bubble, and spends it self in a Blast? Take it in Complication, and we find a Thousand Weaknesses, Iniquities, and Vexatious Cutting Miseries wrapt up in't. VVhat can be more Imprudent than to Affect Reputation by the Methods of Infamy? To Aspire to Greatness by the ways of becoming Odious and Contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible? And to Propose the Erecting of a Mighty Fabrick, upon a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom that will Certainly sink under the Weight?</p>
                  <p>The Disappointments of Those that Build their Hopes in this World upon a False <hi>Basis,</hi> fall under These Three General Heads. The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we Value our selves upon, may either be Taken from Us; or We from Them: Or, which is much at One, we may be brought by a Thousand Accidents to lose the Use and Rellish of them. As first for the Purpose; they may be taken from Us, by Cheats, Robberies, Suborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, False Oaths, Forgeries, Corrupt Judges; To say nothing of Fires, Earthquakes, Tempests, Inundations, Insurrections, and Other Violences without Number. Secondly, We may be taken from Them, by as many Ways as there are out of This World. A Fly or a Hair shall do the Office of a Rope. And then for the Third Branch, an Indisposition, a Feaver, an Acute Pain, an Impetuous Passion, an Anxious Thought, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency and Old Age, shall do the Work of Taking away both the Gust, and the Comfort of them. Nay, the very Loss of One Pleasure is enough to Damp, if not to Destroy the Rellish of Another.</p>
                  <p>But now to carry the Allusion One Step further yet; It may be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally Asserted, that All Proud Men, over and above the Stroke of a Divine Judgment, are Miserable, even in Themselves, and that no Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in This World can ever make them Other. Their Appetites are Insatiable, and their Hearts consequently never at Rest; Whether it be Wealth, Power, Honour, Popular Esteem, or whatever else they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. They Envy, and they are Envy'd. 'Tis Impossible for them to be at rest, without Enjoying what it is Impossible for them to Attain. They live Gaping after More, and in a perpetual Fear of Losing what they have already. The Higher they are Rais'd, the Giddier they are; the more Slippery is their Standing, and the Deeper the Fall. They are never Well, so long as Any thing is above them: And their Ambition carries them on to the Supplanting of their very Masters and Makers: When yet by a most Ridiculous Contradiction, they lie Effectually, (in

V. 11.] Who would have Imagin'd now, that the Stiff Crossness of a Poor Captive, should ever have had the Power to make <hi>Haman</hi>'s Seat so Uneasie to him? Or that the want of a Cap, or a Cringe, should so Mortally Discompose him, as we find afterwards it did! If Large Possessions, Pompous Titles, Honourable Charges, and Profitable Commissions; If a Plentiful Issue, Court Favours, or the Flowing Bounty of a Gracious Prince, could have made This Proud man Happy, there would have been Nothing wanting to his Establishment. But All This did not do his Work, it seems; neither, as big as he was, did there in Truth, need any Great Matter to Unsettle him. But he was as sure to sink under the Infirmity of his Own Mind, as if he had been Doom'd to Sink in the Fate of a Common Ruine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When</hi> Haman <hi>saw</hi> Mordecai <hi>in the Kings Gate,</hi> (says the Text) <hi>that he stood not up, nor Moved for him, he was full of Indignation against</hi> Mordecai. <hi>Nevertheless,</hi> Haman <hi>Refrained himself, and when he came Home, he sent and call'd for his Friends, and</hi> Teresh, <hi>his Wife; and told them of the Glory of his Riches, and the Multitude of his Children, And All the Things wherein the King had Promoted him, and how he had Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him above the Princes and Servants of the King. Tea,</hi> Esther <hi>the Queen</hi> (says he) <hi>did let no man come with the King unto the Banquet that she had prepar'd, but my self; and to morrow am I Invited unto her also with the King</hi> [Yet All This Availeth Me Nothing, so long as I see <hi>Mordecai</hi> the <hi>Iew</hi> sitting at the Kings Gate, <hi>Esther,</hi> Cap. 5. V. 9. 10, 11, 12, 13.]</p>
                  <p>This Instance of <hi>Haman</hi>'s Case may serve, in a Good Measure, for a Moral to the Arrogance of the <hi>Horse</hi> here in the Fable; only <hi>Haman</hi>'s Pride was the more Invidious and Malicious of the Two. To Wind up the Story; <hi>Mordecai</hi> was an Eye sore to <hi>Haman,</hi> and <hi>a Gallows of Fifty Cubits High was prepar'd for him by the Order of</hi> Haman, <hi>Cap,</hi> 5. <hi>V.</hi> 14. But the King, upon Examination of the Matter, Order'd <hi>Haman</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be Hanged. [<hi>So they Hanged</hi> Haman <hi>upon the Gallows that he had prepared for</hi> Mordecai, <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>V.</hi> 10.] <hi>Haman</hi>'s Pride, in fine, was a Torment to him, and he was not only Punish'd By it, and For it, but by a Righteous Judgment of Retaliation, he suffer'd Death Himself up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very Gibbet that he had provided for Another.</p>
                  <p>How Wretched a Creature was <hi>Haman</hi> now, even in the Caresses of his Royal Master, and in the very Rapture of all his Glories! And how Vain again were All the Marks and Ensigns of his Character and Power; that were not able to support him against one Slighting Look of a Sorry Slave! He had the World at Will, we see; but All was as good as No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to him, <hi>so long as he saw</hi> Mordecai <hi>the</hi> Jew <hi>sitting in the Kings Gate.</hi> Where's the Sober Man now, that would not rather chuse to be <hi>Mordecai</hi> in the <hi>Gate,</hi> upon These Terms, than to be <hi>Haman</hi> in the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace?</hi> The One had the Blessing of a Conscience that Fears Nothing but God; the Other was Haunted with a Fantastical Weakness of Mind, that makes a man Dread Every thing, and stand in awe of his Own Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow! A Word, a Thought, an Imagination, a Countenance is enough to Break his Sleep, and to Shake the very Foundations of the <hi>Babel</hi> that he has Built. He fansies Every Bolt that's Levell'd at his

Vices, to be Pointed at his Person, and finds himself Wounded in the Morality of the most Innocent Reproofs. He's a Slave to All Passions, All Accidents, and All sorts of Men. A Jest, a Banter, a Lampoon; Nay a Glance, an Insinuation, or a Bare Casuality, with the Help of a Guilty Conscience, and a Suspicious Gloss of Application, is enough to Murder him; for he Conceits himself to be Struck at, when he is not so much as Thought of: as I dare appeale to the Consciences of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Top Gallant Sparks, that will fancy their Own Case to be the Key to This Moral. He makes himself Odious to his Superiours, by his Haughtiness; to his Equals, by a Restless Course of Factious Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and then he never fails of a Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As to the Wretchedness of his Condition, 'tis all a case to Him, whether he be Teiz'd out of his Life by a Judgment of Flies and Lice, or Stung to Death by Fiery Serpents. And he is not only Tormented by Others, but the very Tormenter of Himself too. Nay, rather than want a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable Ground of Trouble, he Creates it. His Pride is a Continual Drought upon him, and a Thirst never to be Quench'd. His Conscience, his Fancy, his Fears, Jealousies, and Mistakes; Every thing helps on toward his Undoing. And now to the Infinite Variety of Plagues that Wait upon Pride, there is likewise as Great a Diversity of Imperious Humours for This Misery to Work upon. As for Example, There is a Pride of Stomach, a Pride of Popularity, a Pride of Brow, Equipage, and Parade. There's a Pride of Tongue without either Brains, or Heart to Support it. There is an Abject, (in fine) and there is a Surly Pride; But to Conclude, there is All This, and a Thousand times more of the same Kind and Colour, that lies Naturally Couch'd under This Allegory. And not One Instance at last, that is not verify'd by Many and Many an Example.</p>
                  <p>Now as to the Envy of the <hi>Ass</hi> it was a Double Folly; for he Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes both the Horses Condition, and his Own.

                  <p>WE are here taught in some Cases to Yield to Times and Occasions; but with a Saving still, to Honour, and to Conscience. A Wise and an Honest Man will always Mean the same Thing; but he's a Fool that always says the same Thing. <hi>Aesop</hi> however Condemns the Double Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of <hi>Trimmers,</hi> and All False, Shuffling, and Ambidextrous Dealings. He gives also to Understand, that Those that pretend at the same time to serve Two Masters, are True to Neither.</p>
                  <p>The Three Fables next above have a Great Affinity One with Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet not without some Remarkable Diversities neither. From the Emblem of the <hi>Bat</hi> and <hi>Weazle,</hi> we are to Gather, that there are Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ways, Cases, and Occasions, wherein, Disguises, and Artificial E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions are in some Measure Allowable, provided only that there be No Scandalous, or Malicious Departure from the Truth. This Shuffling of the <hi>Bat</hi> in the Paw of the <hi>Weazle,</hi> was but making the Best of what he had to say, and to shew for Himself, toward the saving of his Life. There was No Breach of Faith, or of Trust in't; No Abandoning of a Duty, No Thought of Treachery; Nor in Effect, any thing more in't, than a Fair Christian Way of putting out False Colours.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bat</hi> that stood <hi>Neuter,</hi> may serve for the Character of a <hi>Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Trimmer:</hi> He Betrays his Party, first, in withdrawing his Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Secondly, In going over to the Stronger Side, and Declaring Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an Open Enemy when his Fellows had the Worst on't. His Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in fine, was Just, and if All Double Dealers and Deserters were serv'd as This <hi>Bat</hi> was, it would be an Example of Terrour to Renegades and of Encouragement to Honest Men.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Estriches</hi> Case seems to be Different from the Other Two. He Fought, (though 'tis not said on which side) and he was Taken in the Battel. He had the Shape, but not the Heart of a <hi>Trimmer,</hi> and it was rather Nature then Fraud, that brought him off. Now there are Many things in an Affair of This Quality that may be Warrantable, even upon the Nicest Scruples of Honour, in him that suffers the Violence, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance would not be so in the Aggressor.</p>

Why truly says the <hi>Wolfe,</hi> I have gotten an Indisposition that keeps me much at Home, and I hope I shall have Your Prayers for my Recovery. The <hi>Fox</hi> had a Fetch in't, and when he saw it would not Fadge; Away goes he presently to a Shepherd, and tells him where he might surprize a <hi>Wolfe</hi> if he had a mind to't. The Shepherd follow'd his Directions, and Destroy'd him. The <hi>Fox</hi> immediately, as his Next Heir, repairs to his Cell, and takes possession of his Stores; but he had Little Joy of the Purchase, for in a very short time, the same Shepherd did as much for the <hi>Fox,</hi> as he had done before for the <hi>Wolfe.</hi>

I do not speak of the Trust of Privacy and Confidence only; but a Wise Man would not so much as Venture himself in such Company, nor let him come within distance of so much as knowing how to put a Trick upon him. This Fable shews us the Danger of such Conversation. And it shews us likewise the Just Fate that Attends the Treachery, even of One Traytor to Another: The <hi>Wolfe</hi> had a Design upon the <hi>Fox;</hi> The <hi>Fox</hi> had a Counter-Design upon the <hi>Wolfe:</hi> (which was no more then a Couple of Crafty Knaves well Match'd) And the Shepherd did Justice upon them Both.</p>

Well! says he, If These Pityful Shanks of mine were but Answerable to this Branching Head, I can but think how I should Defy All my Enemies. The Words were hardly out of his Mouth, but he Discover'd a Pack of Dogs coming full-Cry towards him. Away he Scours cross the Fields, Casts off the Dogs, and Gains a Wood; but Pressing thorough a Thicket, the Bushes held him by the Horns, till the Hounds came in, and Pluck'd him Down. The Last Thing he said was This. What an Unhappy Fool was I, to Take my Friends for my Enemies, and my Enemies for my Friends! I Trusted to my <hi>Head,</hi> that has Betray'd me, and I found fault with my <hi>Leggs,</hi> that would otherwise have brought me off.</p>

                  <head>REFLEXION.</head>
                  <p>THIS is to shew us how perversly we Judge of Many Things, and take the Worse for the Better; and the Better for the Worse; upon a very great Mistake, both in what we Despise, and in what we Admire. But we are rather for That which is Fair, and Plausible in Appearance, then for That which is Plain and Profitable in Effect; Even to the Degree of Preferring Things Temporal to Eternal.</p>
                  <p>He that would Know Himself, must look into Himself. 'Tis only the Resemblance, or the Shadow that he sees in the Glass, Not the Man. 'Tis One Thing to fancy Greatness of Mind; Another Thing to Practise it; for a Body may Promise, nay and resolve upon Many Things in Contemplation, that he can never make good upon Tryal. How did the <hi>Stag</hi> despise the <hi>Dogs</hi> here, at the sight of his Armed Head in the Fountain; but his Heart went quite to another Tune, when the Hounds were at the Heels of him. We are likewise taught here, how subject Vain Men are to Glory in That which commonly Tends to their Loss, their Misfortune, their Shame, and their very Destruction; and yet at the same time to take their Best Friends for their Enemies. But there's a Huge Difference betwixt a False Conception of Things, and the True Nature and Reason of them. The <hi>Stag</hi> Prided himself in his Horns, that afterward Shackled, and were the Ruine of him; but made slight of his Pityful <hi>Shanks,</hi> that if it had not been for his Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Head, would have brought him off.</p>

This is the Case of Those that will be Trying Masteries with their Superiors, and Biting of That which is too Hard for their Teeth. There's no Contending with an Adversary that's either Insensible, or Invincible: And the Rule holds, in Matters, not only of Actual Force and Violence, but of Fortune and Good Name; for 'tis no better then Downright Madness, to strike where we have No Power to Hurt, and to Contend where we are sure to be Worsted.

                  <p>To take This Fable in a Political Sense; a Peace that puts People out of Condition of Defence, in case of a War, must expect a War; and such a State as leaves them at the Mercy of an Enemy, is Worse then War it self. There's no Trusting to the Articles and Formalities of an Out-side Peace, upon the pretended Reconciliation of an Implacable Enemy. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion bids us Forgive: But Christian Prudence bids us have a Care too, whom we Trust. 'Tis just in the World as it is in the <hi>Apologue.</hi> Truces, and Cessations, are both Made, and Broken, for Present Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience; and where the Allies find they may be the Better for't, we may lay down this for an undoubted Truth, that there can never want a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for a Rupture, where there's a Good Will to't.

                  <p>THE Fables of the <hi>Ax-Handle,</hi> and the <hi>Wedge,</hi> serve to Precaution us not to put our selves Needlesly upon an After Game, but to Weigh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand what we Say, and Do. We should have a Care how we Arm our Enemies against our Selves; for there's Nothing goes Nearer a Man than to be Undone by his Own Improvidence; and Nothing afterward more Ridiculous, then to Blame Fortune for our own Faults: Though we are so Fram'd by Nature, in respect of our Souls and Bodies, that One Part of a Man is still Wounded by the Other. Nothing so much Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the <hi>Eagle</hi> and the <hi>Thrush,</hi> as the Thought of assisting to their own Destruction.</p>
                  <p>There's No living in This World without an Exchange of Civil Offices, and the Need we have One of Another, goes a Great Way toward the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of us Love One Another. How is this Amity, and Communication to be entertain'd now, but by the Commerce of Giving and Receiving? Reason, and Experience, are Sufficient to convince us of the Necessity of such a Correspondence; And this Fiction of the <hi>Axe</hi> and the <hi>Forrest,</hi> and so of the <hi>Tree</hi> and the <hi>Wedge,</hi> shews us the Danger of it too, if it be not Manag'd with a Provident Respect to All the Niceties of Circumstance, and Contingency in the Case. People have got a Custom, 'tis true, of Computing upon the Present Need, and Value of Things, without ever heeding the Consequences of them: As if all our Askings, and our Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were to be Governed by the Standard of the Market. <hi>'Tis so pityful a Bus'ness,</hi> says One, and <hi>it was so small a Thing,</hi> says Another; And yet this <hi>Pityful Bus'ness,</hi> and this <hi>Small Thing</hi> proves at last to be as much as a Man's Life, Honor, and Estate is Worth. Alas! What's a <hi>Handle</hi> for an <hi>Axe,</hi> out of a whole <hi>Forrest!</hi> What's the Writing of a Man's Name, or the saying Ay, or No to a Question? And yet the very Safety and Honour of our Prince and Country, and the Summ of our Well-being lies many a time at Stake upon the Issue of doing either the One or the Other. Nay and let the People we have to do withal be never so Just and Honest, it is yet a Temerity, and a Folly Inexcusable, to Deliver up our selves Needlesly into Anothers Power: For He that does any thing Rashly, must be taken in Equity of Construction to do it willingly: For he was Free to Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or Not: 'Tis Good Advice to Consider, First, what the Thing is that is Desired. 2. The Character of the Person that Asks. 3. What use may be made on't to the Detriment of him that Grants the Request, and so to Resolve how far in Duty, Humanity, Prudence, Justice, and Respect, we are to Comply with it. Wheresoever there is a Moral Right on the One Hand, No Secondary Interest can Discharge it on the Other. A Pris'ner upon Parole must surrender himself upon Demand, though he Die for't. A Man may Contribute to his own Ruin Several Ways; but in Cases not to be Foreseen, and so not to be Prevented, it may be his Misfortune, and the Man not to blame. We are not to omit Precaution how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for fear an Ill Use should be made of Those Things that we do, even with a Good Intention; but we are still to Distinguish betwixt what may Possibly, and what will Probably be done, according to the Best Measures we can take of the End of Asking; for there would be No Place left for the Functions of Humane Society, if the Possibility of Abusing a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, should wholly Divert us from the Exercise of Charity and Good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. There may be Great Mischief Wrought yet, without any thing of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:66024:50"/>
a Previous Malice, and it may be Hazardous to Yield, even where the Proposal is wholly Innocent. There may be other Propositions again, that were Originally Design'd for Snares, to the Short-sighted and Credulous, Now 'tis the Art of Life, Critically to Discern the One Case from the Other.</p>

of the Whole. 'Tis true, their Operations are More or Less Noble, but the Mechanical Faculties can no more be Spar'd than the Intellectual, and those that Serve in Council under an Appearance of Rest, are yet as Busie, and as Necessary, in their Functions, as those that are Actually and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly in Motion. Here's a Caution in fine, to the <hi>Members,</hi> to have a care how they withdraw themselves from their Duties, till it shall be too late for their Superiors to make use of them.</p>
                  <p>There is so Near an <hi>Analogy</hi> betwixt the State of a Body Natural, and and Politique, that the Necessity of Government and Obedience cannot be better Represented. The Motions of a Popular Faction are so Violent, and Unreasonable, that neither Philosophy, Prudence, Experience, nay, nor the Holy Writ it self, has the Power (ordinarily speaking) to Work upon them. If People would allow themselves Time for Thought, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, they would find that the Conservation of the <hi>Body</hi> depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Proper Use and Service of the Several <hi>Parts;</hi> and that the Interest of Every Distinct <hi>Member</hi> of it, is wrapt up in the Support, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the <hi>whole,</hi> which obliges them all to Labour in their Respective Offices and Functions for the Common Good. There are Degrees of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (no doubt on't) in Both Cases, and One Part is to be Subservient to Another, in the Order of Civil Policy, as well as in the Frame of a Man's Body: so that they are mightily out of the way, that take Eating and Drinking, and Un Eating, and Un-Drinking, in a course of Vicissitude, with other Offices of Nature that are common to Beasts with Men, to be the Great Bus'ness of Mankind, without any further Regard to the Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Duties of our Reasonable Being: For Every <hi>Member</hi> has its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and Respective Function Assigned it, and not a Finger suffers but the <hi>Whole</hi> Feels on't.</p>

                  <p>THIS is to Reprove the Impertinent, Useless, and Unreasonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Those that first Ask what Another cannot Part with, unless he be a Stark Fool, or a Mad Man. And 2. That which if they could obtain would be of No Use, or Benefit to them at all. The Old Moral carries it to Those also that will Part with Nothing to the Poor, even out of their Superfluities: But it seems to be Abominably Wrested, for neither did the One want, nor had the other Any Thing to spare.</p>
                  <p>There are Cerrain Rules to be observed, as well in Asking, as Denying. Things against Nature are unreasonable on Both Sides. Things Impossible are Ridiculous in the very Proposal; and Things which the One cannot Spare, and the Other will be never the Better for, fall naturally within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of Exceptions. That is to say, Those Things that we know not what to do withal if we Had them; and Those Things again, which Another Cannot Part with but to his own Loss and Shame. These Points are the very Conditions of This Fable. Here's a General Caution against Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Desires, and yet let the Refusal be never so Just, it is Possible how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that a Man may Oppose a most Unconscionable Request for an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable Reason; As in the Case for the purpose, of an Ill-Natur'd Denyal, out of a Dislike of the Man, rather than of the Thing it self.</p>
                  <p>The Application of This Fable to Avarice, that will part with Nothing, seems to be Wrested; for it strikes more properly upon the Folly of People's not being satisfied with the Appointments of Nature. An <hi>Ape, with a Tayl,</hi> would be as scandalous, as a <hi>Fox without</hi> One. Why should not Any One Creature Envy the Whole, as well as any One Part of Another? And why should not an <hi>Ape</hi> be as much Troubled that he has no <hi>Wings,</hi> as that he has no <hi>Tayle?</hi> This Grumbling Humour has Envy in it, Avarice and Ingratitude, and sets up it self in fine against All the Works of the Creation.</p>

So that the Character of a Wise Man, lyes at Stake upon Matter of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, One Way, and of a Good Natur'd Man, the Other Way.

The <hi>Lion</hi>'s Design was well enough Cover'd under the Disguise of a Counterfeit Sickness, and a Dissembled Tenderness and Respect, for the Drawing of the <hi>Fox</hi> into the Toyle. For there was the Civility of an Invitation, on the One hand, and some Colour of a Right to a Visit, though but out of Compassion and Good Manners, on the Other: But the <hi>Foxes</hi> Sagacity, and the Prints of the Feet Spoil'd All. This Fable in One Word more, bids us be Careful how we Trust in Any Case without looking Well about us: for 'tis Half the Bus'ness of One part of the World to put Tricks upon T'other. The Heart of Man is like a Bog, it looks Fair to the Eye; but when we come to lay any Weight upon't, the Ground is False under us.

                  <p>THESE Fables lay Open to us the Folly of Those People that make themselves Slaves to their Revenge; for no man should be so Angry with Another, as to Hurt Himself for't. We should likewise Consider, that there's More Hazzard in the succour of a New Powerful Friend, then in the Hostility of an Old Dangerous Enemy; and that the Greatest Empires upon the face of the Earth have had their Rise from the Pretence of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up Quarrels, or Keeping the Peace.</p>
                  <p>These Fables tell us, that it is a Rule of Good Discretion in all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Quarrel, and Controversie, for Him that is Worsted to have a Great Care Whom he calls to his Aid: Especially when there's more of Passion then Necessity in the Case. The <hi>Horse</hi> might have Quench'd his Thirst with Troubled Water; or he might have stay'd the Clearing of it; Or Chang'd his Wat'ring Place; Or when he was forc'd out of One Pasture he might have taken-up in Another, which would have Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd his Liberty upon the Main, though not as to This Particular: But his Stomach was too Great, it seems, to Digest the Affront, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Enemy at his Feet: so that he gives up his Freedom to Gain his Revenge. He has Fair Words however, Rich Trappings, and Large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; but Works only for his Master; and if at any time he does but Slacken his Pace, or abate, either in his Zeale, or in his Mettle, the Spurr is presently in the Flank of him: Or if he be Unruly, the Bit's upon the Check to keep him to his Duty. The <hi>Stag</hi> was too Hard for the <hi>Horse;</hi> and the <hi>Horse</hi> flyes for Succour to One that's to Hard for <hi>Him,</hi> and Rides the One to Death, and Outright Kills the Other? It were Well, if Possible, to keep All Potent Enemies to the Behaviour in such a Case as This, Especially if they Appear under the Shape of Friends: But if People will Venture Life, Liberty and All, for the Clawing of an Itch, and lay Violent Hands upon Themselves, there's no Fence for't.</p>
                  <p>That which <hi>Men</hi> are to <hi>Horses,</hi> in the Scale of Creatures, Men in Power and Authority, are in some Proportion to the Poor and Weak: That is to say in the <hi>Analogy</hi> of Servitude, and Drudgery; and in the carrying of some sort of Burdens that are a Shame to the Bearer. They Toyle and Moyle for the Interest of their Masters, that in requital, break the very Hearts of them for their Pleasure; and the Freer they are of their Flesh, the more Scandalous is the Bondage. When they have done All that <hi>Horses</hi> can do, they are Lash'd, Spurr'd, Revil'd, and Ill Treated, for not being able to do More: They are Hurry'd on without either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite or Reason; And after they have carry'd their Riders safe over All Leaps, and thorough All Dangers, and by All Ways and Means Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Ease, Credit, and Security of their Masters, what comes of them in the End. but to be Strain'd, Founder'd or Broken Winded; Old

Age Overtakes them, and they are e'en Glad to take up in a Mill at last with Grains and Thistles, and there spend the Remainder of a Wretched Life in a Circulation of Misery and Labour.

He that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, Encourages, or Abetts a Mischief, Does it. The Seditious Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, or Divine, Kills No Body with his own Hand, but by a False Gloss perhaps, upon a Law, or a Text, he may cause Ten Thousand Swords to be Drawn, without Spilling One Drop of Bloud immediately Himself. Shall any Man now, that Willfully, and Maliciously, procures the Cutting of whole Armies to Pieces, set up for an Innocent? As if the Lives that were taken away by his Instigation, were not to be Charged upon his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. He that Covers Murder, Oppression, Sacrilege, Rebellion, with a Cloak of Statute and Scripture, makes God and Government, Effectually, the Authors of the Wickedness: And Those are the Basest, and Worst of <hi>Bravo's,</hi> that Employ <hi>Iourneymen-Mercenaries</hi> under them to do the Work. What is This, but to Engage our Bibles, and our Law-Books in a Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy against Themselves? Shall He that gives Fire to the Train, pretend to Wash his Hands of the Hurt that's done by the Playing of the Mine? Humane Corruptions are as Catching as Powder; as Easily Enflam'd, and the Fire afterward as Hard to be Quench'd. That which a Man Causes to be Done, he Does Himself, and 'tis all a case whether he does it by Practice, Precept, or Example. In One Word, He that Kindles the Passions of the <hi>Mobile</hi> is Answerable for the Following Conflagration. When the Men of the Long Robe have once Preach'd the People to Tinder, the Least Spark sets them a Fire: so that they have no more to do then to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate the Doctrine of Disobedience, and so leave the Multitude to chew upon't. A <hi>Trumpeter</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> is the very Emblem of a <hi>Trumpeter</hi> in the <hi>Field;</hi> and the same Charge holds Good against Both. Only the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Trumpeter</hi> is the more Pernicious Instrument of the Two; for the Latter serves only to Rowze the Courage of the Soldies without any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Application upon the Text, whereas the other infuses Malice over and above, and Preaches Death and Damnation, Both in One, and gives ye the very Chapter and Verse for't,</p>

Why, says the <hi>Dog,</hi> I keep my Master's House from Thieves, and I have very Good Meat, Drink, and Lodging for my pains.

Now if you'll go along with Me, and do as I do, you may fare as I fare.

                  <p>We are so Dazzel'd with the Glare of a Splendid Appearance, that we can hardly Discern the Inconveniencies that Attend it. 'Tis a Comfort to have Good Meat and Drink at Command, and Warm Lodging: But He that sells his Freedom for the Cramming of his Gutt, has but a Hard Bargain of it.</p>

                  <head>REFLEXION.</head>
                  <p>IN This Emblem is set forth the Blessing of Liberty, and the Sordid Meanness of those Wretches that sacrifice their Freedom to their Lusts, and their Palates. What Man in his Right Senses, that has wherewithal to Live Free, would make himself a Slave for Superfluities! The <hi>Wolfe</hi> would have been well enough Content to have Barter'd away a Ragged Coat, and a Raw-Bond'd Carcass, for a Smooth and a Fat One; but when they came to talk of a <hi>Collar</hi> once, away Marches He to His Old Trade in the Woods again, and makes the Better Choice of the Two.</p>
                  <p>To speak to the First Point, we are lyable to be Impos'd upon by Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides and Appearances, for want of Searching things to the Bottom, and Examining what Really they are, and what they Only seem to be. This Fiction of the <hi>Wolfe,</hi> is a Reproof to Eager Appetites, and Over-Hasty Judgments, that will not give themselves time to Ballance Accounts, and Compute Beforehand, whether they are to get or Lose by the Bargain. It holds as well against Intemperate Curiosities, and Rash Wishes, That is to say, against the Folly of the One, and the Wickedness of the Other; for if we come once to take Evil for Good, <hi>our very Prayers are turn'd into Sin:</hi> But what with a Certain Itch of Prying into, and Meddling with Other Peoples Matters, and a Natural Levity that puts us upon Shifting and Changing, we fall Insensibly into a Thousand Inconveniencies: and when it comes to That once, that we find our selves Uneasie at Home, and no Resting-Place in our Own Thoughts, (where Rest is Only to be had) we are e'en glad to run away from our Selves, and Hunt abroad for't where 'tis never to be found. This is the Common Root of all our Wandrings and Errors. We Spend our Time, and our Peace, in Pursuit of Things wholly Forreign to our Business, and which will Certainly Deceive us at last.</p>
                  <p>Thus it Is, and Thus it must be, so long as we take Every thing by a Wrong Handle, and only Calculate upon our Own Misfortunes, without any Allowance for the Comforts that we Enjoy. And so we reckon upon our Neighbours Enjoyments, on the Other hand, without any Consideration for the hardships that They Endure. Oh that I had but such a Palace! Says One; Such an Estate; Such a Retinue; This Glorious Train; That Lovely Woman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nay the Envious Freak Descends to the very Point,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:66024:59"/>
and Petticoat. Now These Idle Curiosities may be Specious Enough in the Contemplation; but what if This House, at the Foot of the Account, should Prove to be Haunted, That Gay Furniture Borrow'd; T'other Fine Woman Clapt; The Curse of Sacrilege cleaving to such an Inheritance, and all the rest of the Gawdy Fooleries perhaps Unpay'd for? (as these Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances are No New Things in Nature) Who would not rather take up with the <hi>Wolfe</hi> in the Woods again, then make such a Clutter in the World upon These Scandalous Conditions.</p>
                  <p>For the Obviating of All Cases of this Quality, Children should be Early Instructed, according to their Age and Capacity, in the True Estimate of Things, by Opposing the Good to the Evil, and the Evil to the Good; and Compensating, or Qualifying One Thing with Another. What's Plenty without Health? What's Ease without Plenty? And what's Title and Greatness, with Carking Thoughts, and a Troubled Mind to Attend it? What does That Man Want that has Enough? Or What's He the better for a Great deal, that can never be Satisfy'd? By This Method of Setting what we Have against What we have Not, the Equity of Providence will be made Manifest, and to All manner of purposes Justify'd; When it shall appear upon the Ballance, that Every man has his Share in the Bounties of Heaven to Mankind.</p>
                  <p>As to the Freedom here that <hi>Aesop</hi> is so Tender of, it is to be Understood of the Freedom of the Mind: A Freedom to Attend the Motions of Right Reason; and a Freedom, in fine, not to be Parted with for All the Sensual Satisfactions under the Sun. It is, I say, a Freedom under These Limits; for there's No such Thing as Absolute Liberty: Neither is it possible that there should be any, without a Violence to the Order of the Universe, and to the Dictates of Reasonable Nature: For All men Living are in Some sort or Other, and upon some Penalty or Other, Subjected to a Superior Power; That is to say, the Laws of Morality are Above them: But the Case wherein All men are upon the Behaviour is not here the Question. To Wind up the Moral, in short; Liberty is a Jewel, and a Blessing. The <hi>Wolfe</hi> was well enough pleas'd here with the State of the <hi>Dogs</hi> Body, but he had no fancy to his Collar.</p>

                  <p>THINGS that at first seem Terrible, become Easy to us when we are Wonted to them; says the Old Moral; which holds, I confess, in the Case of the <hi>Camel,</hi> but not in That of the <hi>Lyon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With leave of the Moralist, the Illustration does not come up to the Force and Intent of the Two Last Fables: Neither, in truth, is the very Design of them according to the True Reason of the Matter in Question. Things that seem Terrible, and are Not so, become not only Familiar, but Ridiculous to us, when we find that our Fears were Vain and Idle; as in the case of the <hi>Camel:</hi> But things on the contrary, that only Seem Terrible, but are found upon Experience to be more Dangerous then we took them for: (as in the Strength, the Nimbleness, the Fierceness, and the Appetite of a <hi>Lyon.</hi>) These are Things, I say, that the Better we Know them, the More we Dread them: So that though we have Apprehensions, as well where there is No Peril, as where there Is: Yet Time teaches us to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the One from the Other. The Allusion would much better have held in the case of a Battle, where the Soldier grows Every day less appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive of the Hazzard, by seeing so many People Scape; and by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting upon the Disproportion of Those that Outlive it, to Those that Fall in't. We may however Learn from hence, that people may be Frighted as well Without Reason as With it. Now, in Propriety of Speaking, and in a Right Understanding of the Thing too, People were not so much Frighted, as they were Surpriz'd at the Bigness, and Uncouth Deformity of the <hi>Camel:</hi> But I could Wish, the <hi>Fox</hi> had been More and More affraid of the <hi>Lyon,</hi> the Oftner he Saw him; and the Doctrine would then have been to Govern our Passions by the Truth and Reason of Things, not by Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances; but it holds however, that Custom goes a Great Way in making Matters Indifferent to us. 'Tis much the same Case too, betwixt the <hi>People,</hi> and <hi>Bugg-Laws,</hi> and <hi>Acts of State,</hi> that it is here betwixt the <hi>Fox</hi> and the <hi>Lyon.</hi> Men look, upon the <hi>First</hi> Opening of a <hi>Publique Fast,</hi> as if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth were going together; Not a <hi>Shop Open;</hi> The <hi>Streets</hi> Quiet, and so Dismal a Countenance Every where, as if it were to Rain <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimstone</hi> the Next Moment. The <hi>Second</hi> Day is a Little Uneasy too, but not half so Frightful as the <hi>Former:</hi> and so in <hi>Two or Three days more,</hi> the Awe goes quite off, and the People come to their Wits, and fall to their Trade again, without any further Heed to the Matter.</p>

                  <p>If some men might have their Wills the very Sun in the Firmament should withdraw his Light, and they would submit to Live in Perpetual Darkness Themselves, upon Condition that the rest of the World might do so for Company.

There is in this Malevolence, somewhat of the Punishment, as well as of the Spite, of the Damn'd: They take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Other Peoples Miseries, and at the same Time are their Own Tormentors. This Diabolical Envy is Detestable even in Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; but whenever the Governing Part of a Nation comes to be Taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, there's Nothing so Sacred that a Corrupt Supercilious Ill Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Minister will not sacrifice to This Execrable Passion. No Man should Eat, Live, or Breath Common Air if He could Hinder it. 'Tis the Bus'ness of his Life, and the Delight of his Soul, to Blast all sorts of Honest Men, and not only to Lessen their Characters, and their Services, but to Range them in the Number of Publique Enemies: And he had Twenty times rather see the Government Sink, then have it thought that any hand but his Own should have a Part of the Honour of Saving it.

                  <head>REFLEXION.</head>
                  <p>IN These Three Fables, is set forth the Vanity of Unnatural Wishes, and Foolish Prayers; which are not only to be Rejected, but they deserve also to be Punish'd. Providence has made an Equal Distribution of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gifts, whereof each Creature severally has a share; and it is not for This or That Particular to pretend to All: So that Considering the Equality of the Division, No Creature has Cause, either to Boast, or to Complain. We are never Content with the Bounty of Providence. One would have a Voice; T'other Gay Cloaths; and while Every Man would have All, we Charge Providence with Injustice for not giving to Every Man Alike. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> was in the Right in Saying, That in a Case a Man were to go where he should have the Choice before him, of All the Ill Things and All the Good Things in Nature, he would come home again the same Man that he went out.</p>
                  <p>It is to be Noted, upon the Distribution of the Matter of These Three Fables that the <hi>Camel</hi> prays for Weapons Offensive, and Defensive, either for the Encount'ring of Dangers, or the Repelling of them. The <hi>Fox</hi> and the <hi>Hare,</hi> for the Means of Avoiding them. And the <hi>Peacock</hi> for a Voice, answerable to his Beauty. And All their Prayers are to No Purpose, but to the Reproche of the Petitioners, and to the Confusion of Vain Desires. What is All This but an Appeale from Heaven to Heaven it self; and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning Providenee against Providence, in a Recourse from One Providence to Another? The Determinations and Appointments of Heaven are no more to be Disputed and Controll'd, then they are to be made Better, and Emprov'd; And we must not Presume to Judge of the Goodness and Justice of Heaven, by the Frailties and Corruptions of Flesh and Blood. We were not of Councel with the Almighty, either in the Making, or in the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the World, and we have no more Right to Advise him in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of it. The Power, in fine, that Rules in the Nature of Things is no other then a Divine Influence.</p>
                  <p>Why should not the <hi>Nightingale</hi> Envy the <hi>Peacock's Train</hi> as well as the <hi>Peacock</hi> Envy the <hi>Nightingale's Note?</hi> And why should not All the Works of the Creation Expostulate at the same Rate, and upon the same Grounds? Why has not <hi>Man</hi> the Wings of an <hi>Eagle</hi> to carry him from Danger, or to satisfie his Curiosity what the World's a doing? Why has he not the Sagacity of a <hi>Dog,</hi> the <hi>Paw</hi> of a <hi>Lyon;</hi> The Teeth of a <hi>Leopard;</hi> The Heeles of a <hi>Courser,</hi> and the like? And have not Brute Animals the same Equity of Complaint on the Other Hand, for want of the Faculties and Advantages, Intellectual, and Moral of Mankind? So that here's a Civil War that runs thorough All the Parts of the Universe, where Nothing is pleased with it's Own Lot; And no Remedy at last; but by New Mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World over again. This Inordinate Appetite has been the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of many a Kingdom, Family and Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>To Ask Impossibilities, in fine, is Ridiculous, and to Ask Things Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural is Impious; for to take upon us to Blame, or Mend the Works of Providence, is to suppose the Divine Wisdom lyable to Miscarriages and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes. These Mutterings are Foolish also, even to the Degree of Madness it self; for there's no Thought or Possibility of Relief in the Case. Such as we Are God has made Us: our Post and our Station is appointed us, and the Decree is not to be Revers'd.</p>

                  <p>IT is Wisdom to Consider the End of Things before we Embarque, and to Forecast Consequences. It is also to be Expected that Men in Distress will look to themselves in the First Place, and leave their Companions to Shift as well as they can. When a Knave, and an Honest Man happen to be Embarqu'd together in the same Common Interest, the Sharper will be sure, if ever it comes to a Pinch, to shift for Himself; and leave T'other in the Lurch. It is the way of the World for Men to Abandon their Benefactors, and to make sport with Those that Rais'd them. This was the Trick, that the <hi>Fox</hi> serv'd the <hi>Goat</hi> here in the <hi>Well;</hi> to shew us that He that Helps Another out at a Plunge, runs the Risque of being left in the Mire himself. No Matter for the Morality of the Thing, so long as it is the Fashion; And that He that Advances himself upon the Ruine of Another gets the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Man of Art, and Address. The Facility, in fine, and the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the <hi>Goat,</hi> shews us what an Honest Man is to Trust to that keeps a Knave company.</p>
                  <p>We find in This <hi>Fox,</hi> the Roguery, the Invention, and the Wilyness of the Crafty People we meet with Abroad, and a Lively Image of the Faith, Friendship, Good Nature, and Justice that we are to Expect from them. We cannot therefore keep too strict an Eye upon the Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation of Those we have to do withall. If they be Men of Fraud, they'll never stick at bringing their Friends and Companions into Dangers, Losses, and Inconveniences; Scoure off themselves, and leave Those that Trust them to pay the Reck'ning. But, in a Word, This Application ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Men of Trick and Design of All Sorts; let it be in Pleasure, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, Pride, Envy, Vain-Glory, Trade, Law, Marriages, Quarrels, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, Ambition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wherefore it Behoves us to <hi>Look before we Leape,</hi> and in Case of the Worst that can befall us, to secure an After-Game.

But Time, Power, and Corruption, give a Reputation to the Worst of Practices, and it is no longer Oppression when it comes Gilded with the Name of Authority. This Unequal, and Unreasonable Judgment of Things, brings many a Great Man to the Stool of Repentance; for when he has Swallow'd more then he can Digest, it sticks upon his Conscience, and will neither Up, nor Down. Now in the Sight of Heaven, the Greater the Temptation, the Less is the Sin; and yet in the Vogue of the World, it passes for an Exploit of Honour, for Kings and States to run away with Whole Countries that they have no Colour, or Pretence to; when many a poor Devil stands Condemn'd to a Halter, or a Whipping-Post, for the Pilfering of a Silver-Spoon perhaps, or the Robbing of a Hen-Roost: Though the Former, all this While, has No Better Title to what he takes, then the Latter; and yet to see what a deal of Fulsome Flattery, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrique we have, upon the Glorious Atchievements of the One; and only some <hi>Smithfield Ballad</hi> perchance, or a <hi>Sabbath-Breaking Speech,</hi> or <hi>Confession,</hi> to Embalm the Memory of the Other.

When we have Carry'd a Point as far as it will go, and can make no more on't, 'tis a Stroke of Art and Philosophy, to look as if we did not so much as Wish for a Thing that is not to be Had. Every Man's Present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition has somewhat to be Sayd for't: If it be Uneasy, the Skill will be, either how to Mend it, or how to Beare it: But then there must be no Clashing with the Methods, the Decrees, and the Laws of Nature. A Man that has Forfeited his Honour and his Conscience, seems to be much in the Condition of the <hi>Fox</hi> here that had lost his <hi>Tayle,</hi> and takes as much pains too, to persuade All his Companions to follow his Fashion. He lays down his Arguments, and gives his <hi>REASONS,</hi> Nay, and he endeavours to Prove it by <hi>Scripture</hi> too, that <hi>Men,</hi> in such a Case, ought to go to <hi>Old Nick</hi> for <hi>Company.</hi> We are to Consider here, that the <hi>Devils</hi> have their <hi>Traps</hi> as well as the <hi>Woodmen,</hi> and that it is the Case of many a <hi>Lawyer</hi> and <hi>Divine,</hi> when they come once to be Hamper'd, to rubb off as well as they can, though they Leave their <hi>Consciences behind</hi> them, as the <hi>Fox</hi> did his <hi>Tayle,</hi> and then <hi>Preach up the Blessed Doctrine and Convenience of</hi> No Consciences, <hi>as well as</hi> No Tayles.</p>

                  <p>THIS Fable runs better in the Humour, then it does in the Moral. It lays before us the Unprofitable Vanity of a False Worship, and gives us to Understand, that the more zealous we are in a Wrong Way, the Worse. An Idol is an Abomination in the sight both of God, and of Good Men; and yet we are so to Govern our Selves, even in the Transports of That Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as still to Preserve a Reverence for Religion it self, in the very Indignation we Express for the Corruptions of it.

They Restor'd him however for That Bout, to make Tryal of his Honesty and Good Faith. He was no sooner up, but for want of Living Oxen, he made out his Number upon Past, and Offer'd them up in Form upon an Altar. For this Mockery, Divine Vengeance Pursu'd him, and he had an Apparition came to him in a Dream, that bad him go and Search in such a Place near the Coast, and he should find a Considerable Treasure; Away he went, and as he was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Mony fell into the Hands of Pyrates.

                  <p>'Tis the Practice of the World for People in Distress to serve God and Man, in Several Respects, both Alike; That is to say, when they lye under any Heavy Affliction, or Propose to themselves any Considerable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and find they have Need of Anothers Help; how do they Beg, Vow, Promise, Sollicite, Swear, Sign and Seal and yet Conscious to Themselves all this while, that they neither Intend nor are able to make One Article Good? Wickedness comes on by Degrees, as well as Virtue; and Sudden Leaps from One Extreme to Another, are Unnatural Motions in the Course of our Lives and Humours. Here's first a Rash, and a Knavish Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise; for the Promiser knew he was not able to make it Good. When he has broken the Ice, he Advances, from Cozening of God, to making Sport with him, and pays him with Past for Flesh: But Vengeance Overtook him in the Conclusion, and gave him to Understand, that <hi>God will not be Mocked.</hi> The Moral of This Sick Man is the Case of Every Soul of us in the Making, and the Breaking of our Vows.</p>

The Poor Woman here, had her Jest for her Houshold-Stuff; and the Vain Satisfaction of Paying her Physician with a Conceit for his Mony. It Minds me of the Orator that was to Teach a Young Man Rhetorick, on Condition of Double Pay upon the Perfecting of him in his Profession, and not a Penny before; The Master follow'd his Scholar Close, and came to him at last for his Mony, according to the Bargain: The Young Fellow begg'd him over and over to Forbear it a while, but could not Prevail. He told him Then, that there was nothing Due to him; for if Rhetorick be (as you say) the Art or Power of Persuasion; and if I cannot prevail with you to forbear Your Mony, I am not Master of my Trade yet. This was the Woman's Way of Reasoning with the Physician. The Dr. would have his Mony for the Curing of her Eyes, and the Woman shuffl'd it off that she was not Cur'd, for she could see Nothing at all, which was One Fallacy upon Another.</p>

We find it to be much the same Case in the Government of our Affections and Appetites, that it is in These Bodyly Frailties of Temperament and Complexion. Providence has Arm'd us with Powers and Faculties, sufficient for the Confounding of All the Enemies we have to Encounter. We have Life and Death before us: That is to say, Good and Evil; And we know which is which too: Beside that it is at our Choice to Take or to Refuse. So that we understand what we ought to do; but when we come to Deliberate, we play Booty against our selves: And while our Judgments and our Consciences direct us One Way, our Corruptions Hurry us Another.

                  <p>'TIS a Point of Good Discretion to make a Virtue of a Necessity, and to Content our selves with what we cannot get, though we have never so much a Mind to't; for 'tis a Turn of Art to seem to Despise what we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Compass, and to put off a Miscarriage with a Jest; Beside, that it is Better to have People think a man could Gain Such or such a Point if he Would, then that he Would, but cannot.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Foxes</hi> Put off in This Fable, is a most Instructive Point of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy toward the Government of our Lives; Provided that his Fooling may be made our Earnest; as it would be much for our Honour and Quiet so to be. No man can be Miserable if he can but keep Clear of the Snare of Hopes and Fears; and <hi>Antidote</hi> himself against the Flatteries of the One, and the Alarums of the Other: It is a High Point of Christian, as well as of Civil Prudence; for a man to say Thus to Himself before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, of a Thing that he has a Mind to [<hi>If I cannot get it, I shall be Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without it.</hi>] Or if he can but say after the Missing of it, [<hi>It was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Lost then found.</hi>] Now if we cannot Arrive at the Pitch of making This Indifference a Virtue indeed, we may however so Disguise it yet, (though in a case of Necessity) as to make it Look like One: Not but that it would be much better if we could Attain to the Perfection it selfe, as well as we may in Appearance Cover the Disgrace.</p>
                  <p>I knew a Fine Lady once, and she was a Woman of Sense, Quality, and a very Generous Mind. She lay under Mortifications in abundance, and yet was never Observ'd to be Peevish, or Angry, upon Any Provocation Whatsoever; and the Reason she gave for't was This: [<hi>It Will make Me Look Old,</hi>) So that it is not so much the want of Ability to master our Affections, as the want of Resolution to go thorough with the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is a way to keep us Firm in All Tryals: or if He, that upon a True Principle, lives without any Disquiet of Thought, may be sayd to be Happy. It Emproves All our Disappointments into Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, when we can let fall the Vain Desire of any thing without Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Loss of it. It comes All to a Case now, upon the force of the Moral, whether we Quit, as the <hi>Fox</hi> did the <hi>Grapes,</hi> because he could not come at them, or as the <hi>Wolfe</hi> did the <hi>Sheep,</hi> because he durst not Venture, upon 'em. But be it either the One or the Other, there's a Virtue, and a Blessing in't, Both ways, in getting the Better of our Passions: which might certainly be done if we had but Halfe the Tenderness for our Minds and Consciences, that we have for our Carcasses, and our Fortunes.</p>

                  <p>A Good Man would not Willingly lye under any Obligation to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a Lewd Character and Conversation; for beside the Danger he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currs, it would not be for his Credit neither, where Presents are Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, and rather Snares then Benefits. 'Tis a kind of Incumbrance upon the freedom of a Generous Mind, to be debt to an Ill Man, even upon any Score whatsoever, that does but carry the face of Good Will, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; for 'tis a Debt that a Man's both Asham'd and Weary of 'till 'tis paid off. He lives uneasily under the Burden of it, and Consequently, it is the Debt of All Others that ought first to be Answer'd. And there's Somthing more in't yet too, which is, that when All Common Scores are made even, the Morality of the Obligation still remains; for there's no Cancelling the Bonds of Honor and Justice. Kindnesses are to be paid <hi>in specie,</hi> as well as Mony. That is to say, there must be Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Return, as well as Justice. Now as there can be No True Friendship betwixt a Good Man and a Wicked Man, there should be no Intercourse betwixt them that looks like Friendship, and therefore the Less Commerce the Better.

Now These Impulses are no more to be Controll'd, then the Primary, and the Unchangeable Powers and Laws of Nature: And These Instincts, after All, are no more to be Reason'd upon, then they are to be Resisted; and therefore it is, that we call them <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Qualities;</hi> which is All One with Saying that we do not Understand how they Work, or What they Are.

He that does Nothing at all, does Worse then He, that upon the Account of Humane Frailty, does Amiss; for Nothing can be more contrary to God Himself, who is a Pure Act, then the Sleeping and Drowsing away of our Life and Reason, that was given us for so many Better Purposes.

The <hi>Kid</hi> found that the <hi>Wolfe</hi> was too Nimble for him, and so turn'd and told him: I perceive I am to be Eaten, and I would gladly Die as Pleasantly as I could: Wherefore, Pray give me but One Touch of Your Pipe before I go to Pot. The <hi>Wolfe</hi> Play'd, and the <hi>Kid</hi> Danc'd, and the Noise of the <hi>Pipe</hi> brought in the <hi>Dogs</hi> upon him. Well (says the <hi>Wolfe</hi>) This 'tis when People will be Meddling out of their Profession. My Bus'ness was to Play the <hi>Butcher,</hi> not the <hi>Piper.</hi>

'Tis a very Unequal Encounter, when Malice, Craft, and Power, are United against the Weak, and the Innocent: Saving where Providence Interposes to the Relief of the one, and to the Infatuation of the Other: As the <hi>Wolfe</hi> here, that had a <hi>Plot</hi> upon the <hi>Kid,</hi> was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded by a <hi>Counter-Plot</hi> of the <hi>Kids</hi> upon the <hi>Wolfe:</hi> And such a <hi>Counter-Plot</hi> it was too, as the <hi>Wolfe</hi> with All his Sagacity was not able to Smell out.

The Danger of Trifling with Great Men does not come up methinks, to the Full Force, and Intent of this Fable, which seems rather to set forth the Mistakes of Impotent Greatness, in Mis-judging the Test and Standard of Humane Happiness. What's a Voluptuous Dinner, and the Frothy Vanity of Discourse that commonly attends these Pompous Entertainments? What is it but a Mortification, to a Man of Sense and Virtue, to spend his time among People that take Good for Evil, and Punish where they should Reward, and Reward where they should Punish! The <hi>Tortoise</hi> was Forbidden the Court; That is to say, he was Banished from the sight of Vain, Wicked, and Unprofitable Examples. <hi>Iupiter</hi> gave the <hi>Tortoise</hi> the Honour of an Invitation, but that Honour was yet to the Poor <hi>Tortoise's</hi> Loss; for He that's Transported out of his Nature, and out of his Element, let the Change be what it will, is a Loser by the Bargain. A Plain, and a Homely Home, with Competency and Content,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:66024:108"/>
is beyond all the Palaces under the Heavens; The Pomp, the Plenty, and the Pleasures of them over and above. To say nothing of the Surfeits that are gotten by Excesses of Eating and Drinking; The Restless Nights, Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Emulations, Fewds, and Disgusts that Attend them: Beside the Slavery of being Ty'd up to other Peoples Hours, Meals, and Fashions. He that has no Ambition, is Happy in a Cell, or in a Cottage; whereas the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Man is Miserable, even upon a Throne. He that thinks he has not Enough, Wants, and He that Wants is a Beggar.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tortoise</hi> came Late, for he came Unwillingly, which is the Case of many a Worthy Man that Sacrifices his Peace to Formalities of Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Good Manners. <hi>Iupiter</hi> took Snuff at the Contempt, and Punish'd him for't. And what was the Punishment? He sent him Home again. That is to say, He Remanded him to his Lot, and to his Choice. Such, in Short, is the Felicity of a Moderate, and a Steady Mind, that all Comforts are Wrapt up in't; for Providence turns the very Punishment of a Good-Man, into an Equivalence to a Reward, by Improving that to his Advantage, which was intended for his Ruine; and making the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toise's</hi> Banishment a Blessing to him.</p>

The <hi>Ass</hi> finds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Mistaken in his Opinion, both of the Foundation of Happiness, and of the Stability of it.

Now This Mixture in the Distributions of Providence, duly Consider'd, serves to make us Easy, as well as Necessary One to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and so to Unite us in a Consistence both of Friendship, and of Civil Convenience: For it is no less Requisite to Maintain a Truck in the Matter of Moral Offices, and Natural Faculties, then in the Common Bus'ness of Negotiation, and Commerce; and Humane Society can no more Subsist without the One, then without the Other.

                  <p>'TIS a High Point of Prudence for any Man to be Content with his Lot. For 'tis Forty to One that he that Changes his Condition out of a Present Impatience and Dissatisfaction, when he has try'd a New one, Wishes for his Old One again; and Briefly, the more we shift the Worse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we Are. This Arises from the Inconstancy of our Minds, and One Prayer does but make way for Another. Those People, in fine, that

are Destin'd to Drudgery may well Change their Masters; but never their Condition.</p>
                  <p>He that finds himself in any Distress either of Carcass or of Fortune, should do well to Deliberate upon the Matter, before he Prays for, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves upon a Change. As for Example now, what is it that Troubles me? Is there any Help for't or no? What do I want? Is it Matter of Necessity or Superfluity? Where am I to look for't? How shall I come at it? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now All our Grievances are either of Body or of Mind, or (in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication) of Both, and either the Remedy is in our Own Power, or it is not. There are some Things that we cannot do for our selves without the Help of Others: There are some Things again that Other People Cannot do for Us, nor are they any way else to be done but by Our selves. In the One Case we are to seek abroad for Relief, and in the Other, Whoever Consults his Reason, and his Duty, will find a Certain Cure at Home: So that it goes a Great way in the Philosophy of Humane Life, to Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Just Measures of what we are Able to do, and what we are Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to do, in Distinction from the Contrary; for Otherwise we shall spend our Days with <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Ass in Hunting after Happiness where it is not to be found, without ever Looking for't where it is. 'Tis allow'd us, to be sensible of Broken Limbs, and Diseased Bodies: And Common Prudence sends us to Surgeons and Physicians, to Piece, and Patch them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. But in These Cases we Examine the Why, the What, and the How of Things, and Propose Means Accommodate to the End. 'Tis Natural to be Mov'd with Pain, and as Natural to Seek Relief; And it is well done at last, to do That which Nature bids us do; But for Imaginary Evils, Every Man may be his Own Doctor. They are Bred in our Affections, and we may Ease our selves. If the Question had been a Spavin, or a Gall'd Back, and the <hi>Ass</hi> had Petition'd to <hi>Iupiter</hi> for Another <hi>Farryer,</hi> it might have been a very Reasonable Request. Now if he had but Pitch'd upon such or such a Particular Master, it might have done well enough too: But to grow Weary of One Master, or of One Condition, and then to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently Wishing in General Terms for Another: This is only an Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Ejaculation thrown off at Random, without either Aim or Reason. Upon the Whole Matter, it is but laying our own Faults at the Door of Nature and Providence, while we Impute the Infirmities of our Minds to the Hardship of our Lot.</p>
                  <p>To proceed according to the Distribution of my Matter; it is much with Us in This Case, as it was with the Man that fell from his Horse and could not get up again. He was sure he was Hurt, he said, but could not tell Where. That is to say, <hi>first</hi> our Grievances are Fantastical where they are not Corporal. <hi>2ly.</hi> It is Another Error in us, that in All our Fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Disappointments, we have Recourse to Fantastical Remedies. <hi>3ly.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidience has Allotted Every Man a Competency for his State and Bus'ness. All beyond it is Superfluous, and there will be Grumbling without End, if we come to reckon upon't, that we want This or That because we Have it Not, instead of Acknowledging that we Have This or That, and that we want Nothing. These Things duly Weigh'd, what can be more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential then the Blessing of having an <hi>Antidote</hi> within our selves against all the Strokes of Fortune! That is to say, in the Worst of Extremities, we have yet the Comfort left us of Constancy, Patience, and Resignation.</p>

                  <p>SELF Love is the Root of All the Vanities that are struck at in These Two Fables, and it is so Natural an Infirmity, that it makes us Partial even to Those that come of us, as well as to our selves: And then it is so Nicely Divided, betwixt Piety, Pride, and Weakness, that in Many Cases 'tis a hard Matter to Distinguish the One from the Other. 'Tis a Frailty for a Man to Think Better of his Children then they Deserve: But then there is an Impulse of Tenderness, and of Duty, that goes along with it, and there must be some sort of an Esteem in the Case too, for the setting of That In-bred Affection at Work. The Difficulty lies in the Moderating of the Matter, and in getting the True <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt being Wanting to our Own Flesh and Blood, once Remov'd, and Assuming too much to our selves. Let the Attachment be what it will, we must not suffer our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be either Perverted, Blinded, or Corrupted by any Partiality of Prepossessions whatsoever.</p>
                  <p>The Moral here before us, Extends to the Fruits and Productions of the Brain, as well as of the Body; and to Deformities in the matter as well of Understanding, as of Shape. We are Taught here Principally, Two Things; First, how Ridiculous it is for a Man to Dote upon <hi>Fops</hi> and <hi>Buffoons,</hi> tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much the Issue of his Own Head and Loins; And yet <hi>2ly.</hi> How Prone we are to Indulge our Own Errors, Follies and Miscarriages, in Thought, Word, and Deed. The World has Abundance of These <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Owls</hi> in't: So that Whoever does but look about him, will find so many Living Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations of This Emblem, that more Words upon the Subject would be needless.</p>

                  <p>THERE are Many Cases, and Many Seasons, wherein, Men must either Bend or Break: But Conscience, Honour, and Good Manners, are first to be Consulted. When a Tree is Press'd with a strong Wind, the Branches may Yield, and yet the Root remain Firm. But Discretion is to Govern us, where and when we may be Allow'd to Temporize, and where, and when not. When Bending or Breaking is the Question, and Men have No Other Choice before them, then either of Complying, or of being Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done; 'tis No Easie Matter to Distinguish, Where, When, How, or to What Degree, to Yield to the Importunity of the Occasion, or the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:66024:124"/>
of the Times. It is a Certain Rule, 'tis true (but a General One) That <hi>No Ill is to be done that Good may come of it:</hi> Now the Point will be at last. what's <hi>Simply</hi> Good or Evil; What in the <hi>Contemplation;</hi> and how far the <hi>Intention,</hi> or the Probable <hi>Consequences</hi> of such, or such an Action, may Qualifie the Case: Taking This Consideration along with us too, that we are under a Great Temptation to be Partial in favour of our selves, in the Matter of Ease, Profit, or Safety.</p>
                  <p>The First Point to be Preserv'd Sacred, and from whence a Man is never to Depart, though for the Saving of his Life, Liberty, Popular Credit, or Estate; That First Point, I say, is <hi>Conscience.</hi> Now All Duties are Matter of <hi>Conscience,</hi> respectively to the Subject that they are Exercis'd upon; Only with This Restriction, that a Superior Obligation Discharges, or at least Suspends the Force of an Inferior: As to such a Circumstance for the Purpose, such a Degree, or such a Season. Now there are other Niceties also, as of Honour, Decency, and Discretion, Humanity, Modesty, Respect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Border even upon the Indispensable Tyes of Religion it self; and though they are Not Matter of <hi>Conscience,</hi> Simply, and Apart, they are yet so Reductively, with a Regard to Other Considerations: That is to say, though they are Not so in the Abstract, they Become so by Affinity and Connexion: And such Civil Matters they are, as fall within the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lews of Religion. There are Tryals of Men, as well as Tryals of Trees. Storms or Inundations are the same Thing to the One, that the Iniquity of such or such an Age, or Conjuncture, is to the Other. Now'tis not Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage but Stomach, that makes many People Break, rather then they will Bend; even though a Yielding upon That <hi>Puntillo</hi> (and with a Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science too) might perhaps have sav'd a State. Fractures Undoubtedly are Dangerous, where the Publick is to be Crush'd under the Ruine: But yet after All This Descanting, and Modifying upon the Matter, there's no less Hazzard on the Yielding-side too, then there is on the other. Men may be Stiff and Obstinate, upon a Wrong Ground, and Men may Ply, and Truckle too, upon as False a Foundation. Our Bodies may be forc'd, but our Minds Cannot: So that Humane Frailty is No Excuse for a Criminal Immorality. Where the Law of God and Nature Obliges me, the Plea of Humane Frailty can Never Discharge me. There's as much Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Bending and Sinking, as there is betwixt Breaking and Bending. There must be no Contending with Insuperable Powers on the One Hand, and no Departing from Indispensable Duties on the Other: Nor is it the Part, either of a Christian, or of a Man, to Abandon his Post. Now the Just <hi>Medium</hi> of This Case lies betwixt the Pride, and the Abjection of the Two Extreams. As the <hi>Willow,</hi> for the Purpose, <hi>Bows,</hi> and <hi>Recovers,</hi> and the Resignation is Crown'd and Rewarded in the Success. The <hi>Oak</hi> is <hi>Stubborn,</hi> and <hi>Inflexible,</hi> and the <hi>Punishment</hi> of That <hi>Stiffness,</hi> is One Branch of the <hi>Allegory</hi> of This Fable.</p>

                  <head>REFLEXION.</head>
                  <p>HERE's a Reproof to Men of Sensuality, and Pleasure. The Moral Preaches Industry, and Beats down Sloth, and Shews that After-wit is No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Worth. It must be an Industrious Youth that provides against the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, and Necessities of Old Age; And He that Fools away the One, must either Beg or Starve in the Other. <hi>Go to the Ant thou Sluggard;</hi> (says the <hi>Wise-man</hi>) which in Few Words Summs up the Moral of This Fable. 'Tis Hard to say of Laziness, or Luxury, whether it be the more Scandalous, or the more Dangerous Evil. The very Soul of the Slothful, does Effectually but lie Drowzing in his Body, and the Whole Man is To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally given up to his Senses: Whereas the Profit and the Comfort of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, is Substantial, Firm, and Lasting; The Blessings of Security and Plenty go along with it, and it is never out of Season. What's the <hi>Grass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers</hi> Entertainment now, but a Summers Song? A Vain. and an Empty Pleasure? Let it be Understood however, that we are not to Pass <hi>Avarice</hi> upon the World under the Title of <hi>Good Husbandry,</hi> and <hi>Thrift:</hi> and under That Cover to Extinguish <hi>Charity</hi> by not Distributing the Fruits of it. We are in the First Place, to Consult our Own Necessities, but we are Then to Consider in the Second Place, that the Necessities of our Neighbours have a Christian Right to a Part of what we have to Spare. For the Common Offices of Humanity, are as much Duties of <hi>Self-Preservation,</hi> as what Every <hi>Individual</hi> Contributes to it's Own Well-Being. It is in short, the Great Interest and Obligation of <hi>Particulars,</hi> to Advance the Good of the <hi>Community.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Stress of This Moral lies upon the Preference of Honest Labour to Idleness; and the Refusal of Relief on the One Hand, is intended only for a Reproof to the Inconsiderate Loss of Opportunity on the Other. This does not Hinder yet, but that the <hi>Ants,</hi> out of their Abundance, ought to have Reliev'd the <hi>Grasshopper</hi> in her Distress, though 'twas her Own Fault that brought her to't: For if One Man's Faults could Discharge Another Man of his Duty, there would be no longer any Place left for the Common Offices of Society. To Conclude, We have our Failings, Every Mothers Child of us, and the Improvidence of my Neighbour must not make Me Inhumane. The <hi>Ant</hi> did well to <hi>Reprove</hi> the <hi>Grasshopper</hi> for her <hi>Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness;</hi> but she did Ill then to refuse her a <hi>Charity</hi> in her <hi>Distress.</hi>

                  <p>THIS shews us, how Unnatural a Vanity it is, for a Creature that was Made for One Condition, to Aspire to Another. The <hi>Tortoise</hi>'s Place was upon the Sands, not among the Stars; and if he had kept to his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he would have been in No Danger of Falling. Many a Fool has Good Councel Offer'd him, that has not either the Wit, or the Grace to Take it; and his Willfulness commonly Ends in his Ruine.</p>
                  <p>Every thing in Nature has it's Appointed Place, and Condition, and there's No putting a Force upon any thing, contrary to the Biass and Intent of it's Institution. What Bus'ness has a <hi>Tortoise</hi> among the Clouds? Or why may not the Earth it self as well Covet a Higher Place, as any Creature that's Confin'd to't? It is, in short, a Silly, an Extravagant, and in Truth, so Impious a Fancy, that there can hardly be a Greater Folly then to Wish, or but so much as to Suppose it: But there's an Ambition in Mean Creatures, as well as in Mean Souls. So many Ridiculous Upstarts as we find Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted in the World, we may Imagine to be so many <hi>Tortoises</hi> in the Air; and when they have Flutter'd there a While, like <hi>Paper-Kites,</hi> for the Boys to stare at, He that took them up, grows either Asham'd, or Weary of them, and so lets them Drop again; and, with the Devil Himself, e'en leaves them where he found them. This may serve to put a Check to the Vanity and Folly of an Unruly Ambition; that's Deaf, not only to the Advice of Friends, but to the Councels and Monitions of the very Spirit of Reason it self: For Flying without Wings is All one with Working without Means.

                  <p>IT is Time Lost to Advise Others to do what we either Do not, or Cannot do Our Selves. There's no Crossing of Nature; but the Best way is to rest Contented with the Ordinary Condition of Things. 'Tis but so much Labour thrown away, to Attempt the Altering of Instincts, or the Curing of Ill Habits.</p>
                  <p>Example Works a great Deal more then Precept; for Words without Practice, are but Councels without Effect. When we Do as we say, 'tis a Confirmation of the Rule; but when our Lives and Doctrines do not Agree, it looks as if the Lesson were either too Hard for us, or the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, not worth the While to Follow. We should see to Mend our Own Manners, before we Meddle to Reform our Neighbours, and not Condemn Others for what we do our Selves: Especially where they follow the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Kind, and in so doing, Do as they Ought to do. Let E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing Move, March, and Govern it self, according to the Proper Disposition of the Creature; for it would be Every Jot as Incongruous, for a <hi>Crab</hi> to Walk like a <hi>Man,</hi> as for a <hi>Man</hi> to Walk like a <hi>Crab.</hi> This may be apply'd to the Lessons that are given us for the Ordering of our Lives and Families. But above All Things, Children should not be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd into the Love and Practice of any thing that is Amiss, by Setting Evil Examples before them; for their Talent is only Imitation; and 'tis Ill Trusting Mimicks in such a Case, without a Judgment to Distinguish.</p>
                  <p>This Allegory may pass for a very Good Lecture to Governors, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and Tutors, to behave themselves Reverently both in Word and Deed, before their Pupils, with a kind of Awful Tenderness for
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:66024:127"/>
the Innocency and Simplicity of Youth. For Examples of Vices, or Weaknesses, have the same Effect upon Children, with Examples of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; Nay it holds in Publique too as well as in Private, that the Words and Actions of our Superiors have the Authority and Force of a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. <hi>Regis ad Exemplum,</hi> is so True, that 'tis Morally Impossible to have a Sober People under a Mad Government. For where Lewdness is the Way to Preferment, Men are Wicked by Interest, as well by Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: But to Return to the Stress of the Fable, Let a <hi>Goose</hi> Walk like a <hi>Goose,</hi> and leave Nature to do her Own Bus'ness her Own Way.</p>

                  <p>'TIS a Part of Good Discretion in All Contests, to Consider over and over, the Power, the Strength, and the Interest of our Adversary; and likewise again, that though One Man may be more Robust then Another, That Force may be Baffled yet by Skill and Address. It is in the Bus'ness of Life as it is in a Storm, or a Calm at Sea: The Blast may be Impetuous; but seldom lasts long; and though the Vessel be Press'd never so Hard, a Skilful Steers-man will yet bear up against it: But in a Dead Calm, a Man loses his Spirits, and lies in a Manner Expos'd, as the Scorn and Spectacle of Ill Fortune.</p>

                  <p>THERE's Nothing more Frequent, or more Ridiculous in the World, then for an <hi>Ass</hi> to Dress himself up like a <hi>Lyon:</hi> A <hi>Dunce</hi> sets up for a <hi>Doctor;</hi> a <hi>Beggar</hi> for a Man of <hi>Estate;</hi> a <hi>Scoundrel</hi> for a <hi>Cavalier;</hi> a <hi>Polrcon</hi> for a <hi>Sword-man:</hi> But Every Fool still has some Mark or other to be Known by, thorough All Disguises; and the More he takes upon him, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranter Sot he makes Himself, when he comes to be Unmasqu'd.</p>
                  <p>Every Fool, or Fools Fellow, carries More or Less, in his Face, the Signature of his Manners, though the Character may be much more Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible in some, then in Others; As the <hi>Ass</hi> was found out by his <hi>Voice</hi> and by his <hi>Ears.</hi> Let him keep his Words betwixt his Teeth, and he may pass Muster perhaps for a Man of some Sense; but if he comes to Open once, he's Lost: For Nature never put the Tongue of a Philosopher into the Mouth of a Coxcomb: But however, let him be, in truth, what he Will, he is yet so Conscious of what he Ought to be, that he makes it his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to pass for what he is not: And in the Matter of Counterfeits, it is with Men, as it is with False Mony: One Piece is more or less Passable then Another, as it happens to have more or less Sense, or Sterling in the Mixture. One General Mark of an Impostor is This; That he Out-does the Original; As the <hi>Ass</hi> here in the <hi>Lyon-skin,</hi> made Fifty times more Clutter then the <hi>Lyon</hi> would have done in his <hi>Own;</hi> And Himself Fifty times the more Ridiculous for the Disguise.</p>

                  <p>The Moral of This Fable Hits all sorts of Arrogant Pretenders, and runs Effectually into the Whole Bus'ness of Humane Life. We have it in the very Cabinets, and Councels of State, the Bar, the Bench, the Change, the Schools, the Pulpits; All Places, in short, are full of Quacks, Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers and Plagiaries, that set up for Men of Quality, Conscience, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, and Religion. So that there are <hi>Asses</hi> with <hi>Short Ears,</hi> as well as with <hi>Long,</hi> and in Robes of Silk and Dignity, as well as in Skins of Hair. In Conclusion, An <hi>Ass</hi> of the <hi>Long Robe,</hi> when he comes once to be Detected, looks Infinitely Sillier, then he would have done in his own Shape: Neither is <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Ass Laugh'd at here for his <hi>Ears,</hi> or for his <hi>Voice,</hi> but for his <hi>Vanity,</hi> and <hi>Pretence;</hi> for T'other is but according to his own Kind and Nature; and Every thing is Well and Best, while it Continues to be as God made it.</p>

                  <head>The Moral of the Four Fables Above.</head>
                  <p>We are apt to Ascribe our Successes in This World, and to Impute our Misfortunes, to Wrong Causes. We Assume the One to our Selves, and Charge the Other upon Providence.</p>

                  <p>THESE Four Fables run upon the same Biass; That is to say, the Moral is a Lash at the Vanity of Arrogating That to our selves, which succeeds Well, and the Ingratitude of making Providence the Author of Evil, which seldom scapes without a Judgment in the Tayle on't. But our Hearts are so much set upon the Value of the Benefits we receive, that we never Think of the Bestower of them, and so our Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are commonly paid to the Second Hand, without any Regard to the Principal. We run into Mistakes, and Misfortunes, of our Own Accord; and then when we are once Hamper'd, we lay the Blame of our Own Faults and Corruptions upon Others. This is much the Humour of the World too in Common Bus'ness. If any thing Hits, we take it to our Selves; if it Miscarries, we shuffle it off to our Neighbours. This Arises, partly from Pride, and in part from a Certain Canker'd Malignity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Nay rather then Impute our Miscarriages and Disappointments to our Own Corruptions, or Frailties, we do not Stick to Arraign Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it self, though under Another Name, in all our Exclamations against the Rigour, and the Iniquity of <hi>Fortune.</hi> Now This <hi>Fortune</hi> in the <hi>Fable,</hi> is Effectually, <hi>God Himself,</hi> in the <hi>Moral.</hi> We are apt to Value our selves upon our Own Strength and Abilities, and to Entitle Carnal Reason to the very Works of Grace: And where any thing goes Wrong with us, we lay our Faults, as we do our Bastards, at Other Peoples Doors. This or That was not well done, we say, but alas it was none of our Fault. We did it by Constraint, Advice, Importunity, or the Authority perhaps of Great Examples, and the Like. At This rate do we Palliate our Own Weaknesses and Corruptions, and at the same Rate do We likewise Assume to our selves Other Peoples Merits. The Thing to be done, in fine, is to Correct the Arrogance of Claiming to our selves the Good that does not belong to us on the One Hand, and of Imputing to our Neighbors the Ill that they are not Guilty of, on the Other. This is the Sum of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that's Pointed at in the Case and Custom of Dividing our Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages betwixt <hi>Fortune</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi>

               <p>THIS <hi>Demades</hi> was a very Famous <hi>Orator,</hi> and taking No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice as he was in the Middle of a Discourse to the People upon a Subject of Great Importance, that their Thoughts were Wand'ring upon Something else, he slipt from his Text into This Digression. <hi>Ceres,</hi> (says he) a <hi>Swallow,</hi> and an <hi>Eele,</hi> were Travelling together upon the Way: They came to a River, it seems, and the <hi>Swallow</hi> flew over it; The <hi>Eele</hi> made a shift to Swim thorough it;—And there he stopt. Well (says some of the Company) and what became of <hi>Ceres?</hi> Why (says <hi>Demades</hi>) The Goddess was mightily Offended, to find so many People in the World that are Deaf to any thing they may be the Better for, and yet have their Ears Open to Fooleries.</p>

                  <head>REFLEXION.</head>
                  <p>MEN Mind the Pleasure, and the Satisfaction of a Fancy, or a Loose Appetite more then they do Better Things; and they are sooner brought to Themselves, and set Right by the <hi>Innuendo</hi> of a <hi>Parable,</hi> then by the Dint of direct Reason. There are many Men that are Infinitely Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Point of Honour, and have very little Regard yet upon the Main, to Truth and Equity. Now such People as These are sooner Wrought upon by Shame then by Conscience, when they find themselves Fool'd and Shamm'd (as we say) into a Conviction. This Fable tells us what we Ought to do in the Case of Attending to Instructive and Profitable Counsels. It tells us also what we are apt to do, in Heark'ning after Fooleries: and losing the Opportunity of Hearing and Learning Better Things. And it shews us in fine, the force of an Allegory betwixt Jest and Earnest; which in such a Case as This, is certainly the most Artificial, Civil, and Effectual Manner of Reproach. I call it a <hi>Reproach;</hi> for 'tis an Affront to Good Manners as well as to Ordinary Prudence, not to Hearken to a Man of Authority; That is to say, to the Voice of Wisdom, when she speaks to us out of the Mouth of a Philosopher. Men that have Wand'ring Thoughts at such a Lecture, deserve as well to be Whipt, as Boys for Playing at Push-Pin, when they should be Learning their Lesson: Beside, that it is only Another way of calling a Man Fool, when no Heed is given to what he says. Now <hi>Demades</hi> that Understood both his Bus'ness, and the Weak side of Humane Nature perfectly Well, never troubled his Head to bring his Auditory to their Wits again by the Force of Dry and Sober Reason; but Circumvented them by a Delicate Figure, into a Curiosity that led them Naturally to a Better Sense of their Interest, and their Duty.</p>

                  <hi>AESop</hi> brought the <hi>Samians</hi> to their Wits again out of a most Desperate Sedition with This Fable.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Fox,</hi> upon the Crossing of a River, was forc'd away by the Current into an Eddy, and there he lay with Whole Swarms of Flies, Sucking and Galling of him. There was a <hi>Water Hedge-Hog</hi> (we must Imagine) at hand, that in Pure Pity Offer'd to Beat away the <hi>Flies</hi> from him. No, No, says the <hi>Fox,</hi> Pray let 'em Alone, for the Flies that are upon me now are e'en Bursting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full already, and can do me little more Hurt then they have done: But when These are gone once, there will be a Company you shall see of Starv'd Hungry Wretches to take their Places, that will not leave so much as One Drop of Blood in the Whole Body of me.</p>

                  <hi>Tiberius Caesar</hi> made a very Pertinent Application of This Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to a Case of his Own. The Question was, whether or no he should Casheir some of his Corrupt Governors of Provinces, for Oppressing the People? He gave the World to Understand his Mind by This Fable.</p>
               <p>There was a Man lay Miserably Wounded upon the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and Swarms of <hi>Flies</hi> upon him, Sucking his Sores. A Traveller that was passing by, Pity'd his Condition, and Offer'd him his Service, in Pure Charity to Drive them away. No, No, says T'other, pray let them alone; for when These are gone, I shall have VVorse in Their Places. This will be the Case of My Subjects if I Change their Governors.</p>

                  <p>IF (says <hi>Aesop</hi>) You shall once Destroy your Present Governor, that is Full and Wealthy, you must of Necessity Chuse Others when he is gone, who will be sure to Fill their own Coffers out of What the Other has left ye. This Fable upon the Whole is very Instructive how People should Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have themselves in the Case of Male-Administration, or Oppression; where there is any Colour to Complain of Cruelty, or Injustice under the Cover of Sovereign Power. The <hi>Foxes</hi> Resolution here is mightily to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: That is to say, where the Grievance is only the Unrighteous Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of a Lawful Authority. The Removal of <hi>Blood-suckers</hi> that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready as Full as their Skins will hold, serves only to make way for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are Greedy and Empty. This is no Redress of the Evil, No, nor so much as a Change; but in Truth an Augmentation of it.</p>
                  <p>It is again to be Consider'd, that as Government is Necessary, Sacred, and Unaccountable, so it is but Equal for us to bear the Infelicities of a Male-Exercise of it, as we Enjoy the Blessings of Authority and Publique Order. There's Nothing Pure that's Sublunary, but somewhat still of Good Blended with the Bad, and of Bad with the Good: And This Natural Mixture runs thorough the Whole Course and Condition of Humane Affairs. We are not to be either our Own Carvers, or our Own Chusers, and the Man puts out his Own Eyes that does not see the Folly, and the Iniquity of Struggling with Insuperable Powers, which is Impious in the Practice, and Miserable in the Conclusion. Where Government is Accounted a Bondage, the Exercise of it shall never fail of being call'd Persecution or Opprssion: But to put Matters at Worst, Let us for Arguments sake, suppose Pilling and Polling Officers, as Busie upon the People as These Flies were upon the <hi>Fox:</hi> Better bear a Tolerable Present Calamity then Exchange it for a Worse; and the Fox had the Wit rather to suffer the Galling of a Parcel of <hi>Flies</hi> that were Full already, then by Beating them off, to make way for a New set of Hungry Sharpers that would do him Fifty times the Mischief.</p>

                  <p>THIS Fable holds forth to us several Morals. Rapine and Injustice, Meet in the End with Violence. One Murderer is Kill'd by Another. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers are paid in kind; and One Wicked Man Punishes Another. It is but according to the Course of the World for the Stronger to Oppress the Weaker, and for Thieves Themselves to Rob one Another: But the more Mighty do well however in Avenging Those that are Oppress'd by the Less Mighty. And the Fable has This Prospect too, that Princes are as much Ty'd to Vindicate their Subjects Cause as if it were their Own.</p>
                  <p>'Tis no News for the Weak and the Poor to be a Prey to the Strong, and the Rich, and the Vindication of the Innocent is no Ill Plea, or Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que for the Oppressing of the Guilty. Birds of Prey are an Emblem of Rapacious Officers. A Superior Power takes away by Violence from Them, That which by Violence they took away from Others: But it falls out too often that the Equity of Restitution is forgotten, after the Execution of the Punishment. Now what is This way of Proceeding, but Drinking the Blood of the Widow and the Orphan at second hand? For He that takes away from a Thief, That which the Thief, to his Knowledge, took from an Honest Man, and Keeps it to Himself, is the Wickeder Thief of the Two, by how much the Rapine is made yet Blacker by the pretence of Piety and Justice, Here's a Country-man takes a <hi>Hawk</hi> in the Chace of a <hi>Pigeon,</hi> The Hawk Reasons the Case with him; The <hi>Country-man</hi> Pleads the <hi>Pigeons</hi> Cause, and upon a Fair Hearing; The <hi>Hawk</hi> stands Condemn'd out of her own Mouth, and the Innocent is consequently deliver'd from her Oppressor. Now here's One Violence Disappointed by Another; A Poor Harmless Wretch Protected against a Powerful Adversary; Justice done upon a Notorious Persecutor; and yet after All This Glorious semb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of a Publique Spirited Generosity, and Tenderness of Nature, the Man only sav'd the <hi>Pigeon</hi> from the <hi>Hawk,</hi> that he might Eat it <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:</hi> And if we look Well about us we shall find This to be the Case of Most Mediations, we meet with in the Name of Publique Justice.</p>

                  <p>LET Every Man Examine his Own Strength, and the Force of the Enemy he is to Cope withal before he comes to Close, and Grapple with him: For he's sure to go by the Worst that Contends with an Adversary that is too Mighty for him. 'Tis Good Advice not to Contend with Those that are too Strong for us, but still with a saving to Honesty and Justice, for the Integrity of the Mind must be supported against All Violence and Hazzards whatsoever. This of the <hi>Spider</hi> was a very Foolish Undertaking, and as Unjust a Pretence; for the Equity of the Case is Clearly Mistaken. The Intent of the Fable is to set us Right in the Understanding, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting of Injuries. 'Tis an Unhappy Error to take things for Injuries that are Not so: And then supposing an Injury done, 'tis a Nice Point to Proportion the Reparation to the Degree of the Indignity; and to take a True Measure of our Own Force. It was a Ridiculous Project to think of Catching a Swallow in a <hi>Cobweb;</hi> and the <hi>Spider</hi> was as much Out too in thinking to Restrain the Common Air to its own Particular Use. The <hi>Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> was a <hi>Fly-Catcher</hi> as well as the <hi>Spider,</hi> and no more an Inter-loper upon the <hi>Spider</hi>'s Right, then the <hi>Spider</hi> was upon the Swallows; for the Flies were in Common to Both.

Wherefore let Every Man Compute, first what he ought to do. <hi>2ly.</hi> What he is Able to do. Provided <hi>3ly.</hi> That he Govern himself by the Rules of Vertue and Discretion.

                  <p>It is almost as True in Philosophy as it is in Fact, and Common Practice, that <hi>Honours Change Manners.</hi> Men Assume other Thoughts; Other Opinions of Themselves; Nay, and almost Another Nature, when they Contract other Interests.

                  <p>THIS Fable shews us, that Delicate and Squeamish Humours in the Matter of Meats and Drinks, are Freak, and Phansy, rather then upon any Account of Nature, or Reason. (Some Few Insuperable Aversions only Excepted) There is a Pride, and an Affectation of Singularity, that is never to be pleas'd with any thing that's Cheap and Common; and there's also a Sensual Intemperance for the Gratifying of the Palate; but <hi>Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and no Choice</hi> cures either of These Evils.

But he was forc'd, in the Conclusion, to Eat That Himself, which he had made Unfit for any body else, and There was his Punishment.

               <p>AN <hi>Ass</hi> was Wishing in a Hard Winter, for a Little Warm Weather, and a Mouthful of Fresh Grass to Knab upon, in Exchange for a Heartless Truss of Straw, and a Cold Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

In fine, when he has trod the Circle of the Year in a Course of Restless Labour, his Last Prayer is for <hi>Winter again,</hi> and that he may but take up his Rest where he began his Complaint.</p>

                  <p>The Life of an Unsteady Man runs away in a Course of Vain Wishes, and Unprofitable Repentance: An Unsettled Mind can never be at Rest. There's No Season without it's Bus'ness.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Asses Wish</hi> here, is the Lively Image of a Foolish, and a Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Levity of Mind; and, in truth, there is but too much in't of the Figure, and the Bus'ness of Humane Life; for we spend our days in a kind of Lazy, Restless Indisposition, that looks as if we would fain be doing something, and yet never goes further, then to a Shifting from One Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to Another. <hi>Wishing and Woulding,</hi> (as they say) has somewhat in it of an Analogy to Stretching, and Yawning; We only Drowse when we think we Live, and our time runs away in Fancying <hi>Castles in the Air,</hi> and in putting of Cases. The Inference that we are to draw from hence is This; If an Unsettled Head and Heart be so Grievous a Calamity, the Squaring of a Man's Thoughts, Wishes and Desires, to the Lot that Providence has set Out for him, is both a Blessing, and a Duty.</p>
                  <p>He that is still Weary of the Present, shall be most certainly Sollicitous for the Future. For the Present is only the Course of so many Moments into time to Come. He that Gapes after he knows not what, shall be sure to Lose his Longing. He Changes, out of Restlesness, not Choice, and so long as he carries the same Mind about him, the Circumstances of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:66024:169"/>
his Condition will never Alter the Case. His Present Thoughts are Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy, because his Present State does not Please him, and so he goes on at a Venture. Shifting and Casting about for somewhat else that may better Agree with him. The Batchellor wants a Wife; The Marry'd Man wants his Liberty; The Statesman has a Mind to be Private. The Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lives out of the World: The Man of Bus'ness is a Slave to't; And he that's out of Employment, makes it his Excuse, that he is forc'd to Drink or Whore for want of somewhat else to do. There's no Measure to be taken of an Unsteady Mind; but still 'tis either too Much, or too Little; too Soon, or too Late. The Love of Novelty begets, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases the Love of Novelty; and the oft'ner we Change, the more Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and Troublesome do we find This Itch of Variety to be. The <hi>Ass</hi> was Sick of the <hi>Spring; Sicker</hi> yet of the <hi>Summer; more Sick</hi> still of <hi>

                  <p>This it is, when Fickle and Foolish People will be Prescribing To, and Refining upon the Wise and Gracious Appointments of the Maker of the World. They know not what they Are, and they know not what they Would be, any further, then that they would not be what they are. Let their Present State in the World be what it will, there's still something or other in't that makes their Life Wearysome: And they are as Peevish Company to Themselves too, as they are to their Neighbours; for there's not One Circumstance in Nature, but they shall find Matter to Pick a Quarrel at: Let it be Health, Fortune, Conversation, Kindred, Friends, it will be all a Case, so long as Weak, and Wayward Men shall go on Grumbling, and Cavilling at the Works and Dispensations of Heaven. Were it not better now for People to be Quiet at first; and to sit down Contentedly in the Post where Providence has Plac'd them? Were it not better to do the Great Work of Life Betimes, by the Help of a Seasonable Prudence and Vertue, then to Deliver up our selves to the Torments of Hopes and Fears, and be forc'd to do't at last, by the Dear-bought Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of our Follies, and the Necessity of giving over what we can do no Longer?</p>
                  <p>This is not yet to bar Honest Industry, or a Sober Application to those Ways, Studies, or Means that may probably Contribute to the Mending of a Man's Fortune: Provided that he set up his Resolution before-hand, not to let himself down below the Dignity of a Wise Man, be the Issue of his Endeavours what it will. He that is not Content at Present, carries the same Weakness along with him to his next Remove; for whoever ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Passionately Covets any thing that he has Not, or feels himself Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a Satiety of what he Possesses, has already lost his Hold: So that if we would be Happy, we must Fix upon some Foundation that can never Deceive us; and Govern our selves by the Measures of Sobriety and Justice.

It is not Every Mans Talent to Distinguish Aright upon All the Necessities of Affairs of This Nature. That is to say, how far our Prudence, may Warrant our Charity, and how far our Charity may Comport with our Prudence. 'Tis Dangerous on the One hand to pass the Rules of Discretion; and it is Inhumane on the Other, not to Acquit our selves in All the Functions of Tenderness, and Good Nature; for Piety and Wisdom are Both Wrapt up in the Question.

                  <p>A Wise Book is much better than a Foolish Companion; And the Dead, in such a case, are much Better then the Living. It is one of the most vexatious Mortifications perhaps, of a Sober, and a Studious Mans Life, to have his Thoughts Disorder'd, and the very Chain of his Reason Discompos'd, by the Importunity of a Tedious, and an Impertinent Visit. Especially, if it be from a Fool of Quality, where the very Figure of the Man Entitles him to All Returns of Good Manners and Respect. And the Affliction is yet more Grievous, where That Prerogative of Quality, is further Back'd and Corroborated, with a Real Kindness, and Good Will: For a Man must be Inhumane, and Ungrateful, as well as Rude, if he does but so much as Offer, at the Easing, or the Relieving of Himself. The Drist of This Fable at last, is to tell us, that <hi>Good Books</hi> and Good Thoughts are the <hi>Best Company,</hi> and that they are Mistaken that think a Wise Man can ever be Alone.

Wreaking of a Revenge; which shews likewise that Heaven takes the Cause of the Weak and the Guiltless into a Particular Care.</p>
                  <p>This Councel of the Rabbets has somewhat in it of the Debates of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Meetings, where the Number and the Agreement Supplies the want of Other Means: And we are taught from hence too, that States are not so much in danger of Open Force, as of Secret Mines: For when the Foundation is once Loosen'd; The Least Breath of a Commotion lays the Whole Building in Rubish. We are taught also, that the Only, or at least the Main Support of Power is Justice, in the Due Distribution of Reward and Punishment. Where These Two Principles are Perverted, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is off the Ballance, and the Worse Part of it Out-Weighs the Other. But the Judgments of Heaven Supply the defects of Common Justice, and Avenge the Cause of the Poor and Innocent upon the Heads of the Mighty.

                  <p>A Wise Man, in All Controversies, will try what may be done by Fair Means before he comes to Foul: And where the One fails, the Other will Certainly do the Work. The Fear of Hell does a great deal toward the Keeping of us in our way to Heaven; and if it were not for the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, the Laws neither of God, nor of Man, would be Obey'd.

'Tis True, That one Thing is Preferible to another, in some Sort, or in some Respect; but it is True withal, that every Distinct Being has somewhat Peculiar to it self, to make Good in one Circumstance what it Wants in Another. It is the Ignorance of the Nature of Things, that makes us Despise, even the Meanest of Creatures. All Things are Created Good in their several Kinds, as All things severally are Subservient, in some Degree or other, to the Beauty, the Order, and the Well-being of the Whole. That which we find in the Course of Nature, holds likewise in Government, where the Lowest has its Post Allotted it as well as the Highest.

The <hi>Sluggard's</hi> Case in this Fable is the Case of Mankind in all the Duties of a Virtuous and a Well-Govern'd Life, where Judgment and Conscience calls us one Way, and our Lusts hurry us another. We spend All our Days upon Frivolus <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries,</hi> without ever coming to a Resolution upon the Main Points of our Business. We <hi>will,</hi> and we will <hi>not,</hi> and then we will <hi>not again,</hi>
                     <pb n="322" facs="tcp:66024:185"/>
we <hi>will.</hi> At this rate we run our Lives out in Adjournments from Time to Time, out of a Fantastical Levity that holds us <hi>off and on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Hawk and Buzzard,</hi> as we say, to keep us from bringing the Matter in question to a Final Issue. And yet we know well enough what we ought to do, and what not, if we would but take the Light of Reasonable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for our Guide, and hearken to the Councellor that every Man car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in his own Breast. But Men in the General, are either too Lazy to Search out the Truth, or too Partial, in favour of a Sensual Appetite, to take notice of it when they have found it. They had rather be Tasting the Ease and the Pleasures of Life, than Reforming the Errors and the Vices of it. Does not the Voluptuary understand in all the Liberties of a Loose and a Lewd Conversation, that he runs the risque both of Body and Soul on the one Hand, and Opposes all the Blessings that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Duties of Virtue and Sobriety on the other? Does not the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, the Envious, and the Revengeful Man know very well, that the Thirst of Blood, and the Affectation of Dominion by Violence and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, is a most Diabolical Outrage upon the Laws of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and upon the common Well-being of Mankind? But these People are <hi>Hearing Causes</hi> too, with our <hi>Slug-a bed</hi> in the <hi>Apologue;</hi> that is to say, Deliberating betwixt Passion and Conscience, till in the End, they are called away, whether to <hi>Dinner</hi> or to <hi>Death,</hi> it makes no Matter, for the Moral is still the same.</p>

If Sovereign Power cannot Dispense, 'tis Ty'd up they cry; and if it may be Ty'd up, 'tis no longer Sovereign Power; for that which Tyes it up, is Above it.

Nay the very Altar it self scapes not the Almighty Power of so Irresistible a Temptation; for we are taught in this Fable, that an Episcopal Habit is not one jot better Proof against Corruption, than a Colonels Buff-Coat. 'Tis not a Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Pretence, under a Pomp of Form and Title, without the Grace of an Inward Affection and Integrity that will serve the Turn: The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Christian Faith, and the Doctrin of our Blessed Lord and his Apostles, are to Day, and to Morrow and the same for ever; not to be Moulded and Accommodated to every turn of State, but to be held and kept Inviolate as a standing Rule to all Ages.

               <p>AN <hi>Old Man</hi> and a Little <hi>Boy</hi> were driving an <hi>Ass</hi> before them to the Next Market to Sell. Why have you no more Wit, (says one to the Man upon the Way,) than You and your Son to Trudge it afoot, and let the Ass go Light? So the Man set the <hi>Boy</hi> upon the Ass, and Footed it <hi>Himself.</hi> Why Sirrah, says Another after this, to the <hi>Boy,</hi> Ye Lazy Rogue you, must you Ride, and let your Antient <hi>Father</hi> go afoot? The Man upon this, took down his <hi>Boy,</hi> and got up <hi>Himself.</hi> D'ye see (says a Third) how the Lazy Old Knave Rides <hi>Himself,</hi> and the Poor Little <hi>Child</hi> has much ado to Creep after him! The <hi>Father,</hi> upon this, took up his <hi>Son</hi> Behind him. The next they met, ask'd the <hi>Old Man</hi> whether his <hi>Ass</hi> were his Own or no? He said Yes. Troth, there's little sign on't says t'other, by your Loading him thus. Well says the Fellow to Himself, and what am I to do now? for I am Laugh'd at, if either the <hi>Ass</hi> be Empty, or if <hi>One</hi> of us Rides, or <hi>Both;</hi> and so in the Conclusion he Bound the <hi>Asses</hi> Legs together with a Cord, and they try'd to carry him to Market with a Pole upon their Shoulders betwixt them. This was Sport to every Body that saw it, insomuch that the Old Fellow in great Wrath threw down the <hi>Ass</hi> into a River, and so went his way Home again. The Good Man, in fine, was willing to Please Every body, but had the Ill Fortune to Please No body, and lost his <hi>Ass</hi> into the Bargain.</p>

                     <hi>So many Men, so many Minds;</hi> and this Diversity of Thought must necessarily be attended with Folly, Vanity, and Error: For Truth is one and the same for Ever, and the Sentence of Reason stands as Firm as the Foundations of the Earth. So that no Man can be either Happy or Secure that governs himself by the Humour and Opinion of the Common People. 'Tis a Thing utterly impossible to Please All, and none but a Mad Man will endeavour to Please those that are Divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and can never Please one another. A Wise, and an Honest Man lives
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:66024:189"/>
by Rule, and Consults the Conscience of his Actions, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Popular Applause. Did ever any Mortal yet in his Right Wits, Advise with the <hi>Mobile</hi> about the Government of his Life and Manners? (Or which is all one, with the Common and Professed Enemies of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Virtue,) Did ever any Creature make a Friend or Confident of them? Why should we be sollicitous then to be thought well of by those that no Prudent Good Man ever thought well of? They are all Passion and Fancy, without either Judgment or Moderation: They nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther understand what they do, nor why; but act with a kind of <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that knows neither Consideration nor Conduct. So that it is in truth, a Scandal, and an Ill Sign to Please them; but a worse yet, for a Man to Value himself upon the Reputation of a Popular Favour. What are their Affections but Violent Transports that are carried on by Ignorance and Rage? What are their Thoughts of Things, but variety of Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible Error? And what are they themselves in their own Nature, but a <hi>Herd</hi> rather than a <hi>Society?</hi> Their Humour is very Happily set forth in this Fable; and so is the Vanity of the Old Man's endeavouring to keep Fair with them; for they are still unsatisfied with the Present State of Things, and consequently never to be Pleased. Now if a Man had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to do but to Fool away his Days in the Pursuit of Phantomes and Shadows, and then at last lye down in the Dust like a Brute, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Fear or Danger of an after-Reckoning, the Care were taken; but for a Reasonable Soul to Post-pone the most Necessary Offices and Duties of Life, and to Hazzard the very loss even of Heaven it self, in favour of a Depraved Appetite? What has he to Answer for, that shall be found Guilty of so Impious a Madness? The very Dog's not worth the Hanging, that runs out at Check, and lets every Cackling Crow or Daw Divert him from his Game and Business. To Conclude; a due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Vanities of the World, will Naturally bring us to the Contempt of it; and that Contempt of the World will as certainly bring us Home to our Selves. This was the Case of the Poor Man here, when he had Try'd this, and that, and t'other Experiment, he threw all his Care and Follies together with his Ass into the River: And then he was at Rest.</p>

                  <p>'TIS a Point of Decency and Discretion for a Man to Comply with the Common Customs of the Place, where he Lives, over and above the Rules of Good Neighbourhood and Society. So that the Old Hunks here was well enough serv'd to be Trick'd out of a Whole Hog for the Saving of his Puddings: And it was so much the Better too, that he was of the Plot to the Fooling of Himself, and had his own Jest turned upon him in Earnest: For he was caught in his own Snare, and met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as we say, in his own Kind. And we may make this further Use on't, That an Ill Natur'd Thrift, is next Door to Squandring: He was Cheated, and he was Laugh'd at, and he Deserv'd both; for he made himself a Party to the Picking of his own Pocket, and the very Sham that he designed upon his Neighbours was turned upon Himself.

This past on, till the Holy Brother came for his next Years Provision. Yes, says the Clown, Your'e a Trusty Spark in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to take Charge of my Sheep, and then let the <hi>Wolf</hi> Eat them all; your Promises are not worth a Fart, and I'le have no more to do with you.

When Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men come once to be Mercenary, and to Prostitute the Truth for Mony, no wonder, after their Example, if the Laity Govern their Consciences too by the same Measure. It makes Religion look liker a Trade; or a Contrivance of State, than a Divine Inspiration: Nay, it staggers People in the very Foundations of their Faith, to see Ministers at Variance with themselves, and the Pulpits changing with the Times, and paradoxing upon the Gospel. Holy Men Teach in their Lives as well as with their Lips, and it draws an Irreverence upon the Function, where the one bears a Contradiction to the other. There must be no Preaching of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one Day, and Damnation another, upon one and the same Text. There are Quacks in Divinity, as well as in Physick, and Pretenders to the Absolving of all Sins, as well as to Remedies for all Diseases. But the Curate went beyond his Province, when he stretch'd his Patent for the Cure of Souls, to a kind of Tutelary Guardianship over Goods and Chattels. When such an Impostor has once forfeited the Credit of his Doctrin, 'tis a shrewd Temptation to his Disciples to question the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>THere was a Physician in <hi>Milan</hi> that took upon him to Cure Mad-men; and his way was this: They were Ty'd Naked to a Stake, and then set up right in a Nasty Puddle, Deeper or Shallower, according to the degree of the Distemper; and there to continue, till betwixt Cold and Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they might be brought to their Wits again.

               <p>As he was standing one Day at the Outer-Gate, there came a <hi>Falkner</hi> Riding by, with his Kites and his Curs, and all his <hi>Hawking Trade</hi> about him.

                  <p>THIS Story gives us to understand in the Application of it, that there are more Mad-men out of <hi>Bedlam</hi> than in't; and that according to <hi>Horace,</hi> We are all Mad, every Mother's Child of us, more or less; and therefore 'tis but Neighbourly Justice for One Mad-man to bear with another. 'Twas well enough said of a Fellow in a Mad-House that was asked in the Interval of his Distemper, how he came to be there? Why, says he, <hi>The Mad Folks abroad are too many for us, and so they have Master'd all the Sober People, and Coop'd 'em up here.</hi> There's an Alienation of Mind in the Moral, as well as in the Physical Acceptation of the Expression; and he's as Mad a Man that abuses his Reason, as he that has lost the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of it: Beside, that there's as great a Diversity of Freak and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy in the one Sense as in the other; and they have their <hi>Paroxisms</hi> and their Intermissions both alike. Every Man Living in fine, has his weak side, and 'tis but striking the right Vein to set the Humour a Working.</p>
                  <p>The General Doctrin of this Parable, we find summ'd up in a very few Words here; that is to say, he that eagerly pursues any thing, and gives more for't than it is worth, is no better than a Mad-Man. Now the way to make a true estimate, both of the Price and of the Purchase, is only to set the one against the other, and so to Ballance the Account. One Mans Head runs Riot upon Hawks, Hounds, Dice, Drabs, Drinking, Revelling, and for Brevity sake, we may e'en take in the whole Roll of Good Natur'd Sins and Pleasures, (if I may call them so,) that may serve to Gratify a Sensual Appetite. Let but a Man consider now the Time, Mony, Care, Labour, and Vexation that this Wild-Goose-Chase has cost him, and then say to himself on the other hand, what have I gotten to answer all this Expence, but the Loose, Giddy Frolick of a few Mad Hours, attended with Claps, Gouts, Palsies, Infamy, Beggery, Nauseous Qualms, Surfeiting Satieties, Anxiety of Thought and Conscience, and all attended with the Anguish of a Late and an Unprofitable Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Conclusion? And it is the same thing too with the Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Transports of Ambition, Pride, Envy, Revenge, and the like; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and above the Irreparable Loss of a Thousand Blessed Opportunities, to the extream Hazard of Eternity it self.

                  <p>All Rash and Aspiring Humours, fall under the Reproof of this Moral; for there are Climbers in State, as well as in Woods and Orchards; and Favourites run as great a Risque in Mounting to Honours, Charges and Preferments, as the Fellow did here in Climbing an <hi>Apple-Tree.</hi> Their Rise is commonly Gentle and Step by Step; but when they are once up, they are in danger of falling down again by their own Weight: Wherefore <hi>Slow</hi> and <hi>Sure</hi> in these Cases, is good Counsel.

That is to say, the one Teaches us Wit, by shewing us where we play'd the Fool, and the other Teaches us Wit, by keeping us before-hand from Playing the Fool at all. To apply this Moral to the Fable now, the stress of it rests upon the matter of Foresight, and After-Wit, and the Doctrin tells us, that he that wants the one, must make his Best of the other: This was the very Case of the Man in the Orchard here, before and after his Fall. Now Nature does nothing by <hi>Starts</hi> and <hi>Leaps,</hi> or in a <hi>Hurry,</hi> as we say; but all her Motions are Gradual, Regular, and without Noise, which may serve us for a Lesson, and a President, not to do any thing Rashly.</p>

               <p>THere was a Question started betwixt a <hi>Fox</hi> and a <hi>Cat,</hi> which of the Two could make the best Shift in the World, if they were put to a Pinch. For my own part, (says <hi>Reynard,</hi>) when the worst comes to the worst, I have a whole Budget of Tricks to come off with at last. At that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, up comes a Pack of Dogs full-Cry toward them. The <hi>Cat</hi> presently takes a Tree, and sees the Poor Fox torn to Pieces upon the very Spot. Well, (says <hi>Puss</hi> to her self,) One Sure Trick I find is better than a Hundred Slippery ones.</p>

                  <p>ONE Double Practice may be disappointed by another; but the Gifts of Nature are beyond all the Shams and Shuffles in the World. There's as much difference betwixt Craft and Wisdom, as there is betwixt Philosophy and Slight of Hand. Shifting and Shuffling may serve for a Time, but Truth and Simplicity will most certainly carry it at the long run. When a Man of Trick comes once to be Detected, he's Lost, even to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and Purposes: Not but that one Invention may in some Cases be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly Countermin'd with another. But this is to be said upon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That Nature provides better for us, then we can do for our selves; and instructs every Creature more or less, how to shift for it self in cases of Ordinary Danger. Some bring themselves off by their Wings, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by their Heels, Craft or Strength. Some have their Cells or Hiding Places; and upon the Upshot, they do more by Vertue of a Common Instinct toward their own Preservation, then if they had the whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Virtuosi</hi> for their Advisers. It was <hi>Nature</hi> in fine, that brought off the <hi>Cat,</hi> when the <hi>Foxes</hi> whole Budget of <hi>Inventions</hi> fail'd him.</p>

They look upon it as so much time lost, to employ the Present upon the thought of the Future; and so by one Delay after another, they spin out their whole Lives, 'till there's no more Future left before 'em.

This Fable shews us, that Men of Blood will stick at no Profitable Villany, but they are Blind, Deaf, and Inexorable where Mony's in the case.

               <p>A <hi>Spider</hi> that had been at Work a Spinning, went Abroad once for a little Country Air to Refresh her self, and fell into Company with the <hi>Gout,</hi> that (by the way) had much ado to keep Pace with her. When they came at Night to take up their Lodging, very Inquisitive they were into the Character and Condition of their Host: But the <hi>Spider</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more Ceremony, went into the House of a Rich Burgher, and fell presently to her Net-work of Drawing Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs up and down from one side of the Room to the other; but there were so many Brooms, and Devillish House-wenches still at hand, that whatever she set up this Moment, was swept away the next: So that this miserable <hi>Insect</hi> was the only Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture within those Walls that felt either Want or Trouble. But the <hi>Gout</hi> all this while, was fain to Kennel in the very <hi>Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi> of common Beggers, where she was as uneasy, as Hard Lodging, Course Bread, and Puddle-Water could make her. After a tedious and a restless Night on't, they met again next Morning by Sun-Rise, and gave one another the History of their Adventure. The <hi>Spider</hi> tells tells first how Barbarously she had been us'd; how cursedly Nice and Cleanly the Master of the House was; how impertinently Diligent his Servants were, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then the <hi>Gout</hi> Requited the <hi>Spider</hi> with the Story of her Mortifications too. They were in short, so unsatisfied with their Treatment, that they resolved to take quite contrary Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures the next Night. The <hi>Spider</hi> to get into a Cottage, and the <hi>Gout</hi> to look out for a Palace. They did what they Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, and never were Creatures better pleas'd with their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. The Gout had her Rich Furniture, Down-Beds, <hi>Beccafica's,</hi> Pheasants, Partridges, Generous Wines; the best in fine, of every thing that was to be had for Mony, and all with <hi>Pure Heart, and Good will</hi> as we say. The <hi>Spider</hi> was as much at Ease on the other hand; for she was got into a House where she might draw her Lines, Work, Spin, Mend what was A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, Perfect what she had Begun, and no Brooms, Snares or Plots to Interrupt or disturb her. The Two Travellers after this met once again, and upon conferring Notes; they were both so well satisfied, that the <hi>Gout</hi> took up a Resolution for ever
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:66024:201"/>
after to keep Company with the Rich, the Noble, and the Voluptuous; and the <hi>Spider</hi> with the Poor and Needy. What Wise Man I say, upon these Terms; would not rather take up his Lodging with the <hi>Spider</hi> in the Fable here, then with the <hi>Gout?</hi>

                  <p>THE Kindling of a Torch at the Altar, and then Robbing the Church by the Light on't, is an Old Invention contriv'd betwixt the World, the Flesh and the Devil; and will never be out of Date, so long as we hold any Intelligence with the Common Enemies of Mankind. There's nothing cuts Religion, like Religion it self: Texts are put up against Texts, and one Scripture made to fight against another; insomuch, that the Rule of Faith is Perverted into a Doctrin of Heresy and Schism; and the Gospel of Peace is made a Voucher for Sedition and Rebellion. There's nothing commoner then to cite Holy Writ for the Overturning of Religion, and to Over-rule one Divine Authority with another; nay, and when all is done, to Justifie the Sacrilege of Seizing and Employing the Revenues of the Church to Prophane Uses. And whence comes this Confusion and Self-Contradiction all this while? but that the Manage of Holy Matters falls many times into the Hands of Men of more Polite Curiosity and Skill, then Evangelical Zeal and Affection. The School-men have spun the Thread too fine, and made <hi>Christianity</hi> look liker a Course of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi> then a <hi>System</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Supernatural Revelation:</hi> So that the Spirit of it Evaporates into Niceties and Exercises of the Brain; and the Contention is not for Truth, but Victory. The whole Business in fine, is sour'd into Altercation and Cavil; but all must be Remitted to the Judgment of the Great Day, when every Man shall receive according to his Works: And Wo be then to the <hi>Church-Robbers</hi> that shall be found among them that serve at the <hi>Altar.</hi> But 'tis no New Thing for Men that call themselves <hi>Professors</hi> and <hi>Disciples,</hi> to <hi>Sell</hi> and to <hi>Betray</hi> their <hi>Lord and Master;</hi> For Men that wear the Livery of the Church, and Eat the Bread on't, to offer Sacrilegious Violence to their Holy Mother. And this is the case of <hi>Iupiter's Altar Robb'd</hi> by the Light of his own Torch: When the House of God is Rifl'd and Dishonour'd by his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks; that is to say, when the Sacrilege is Countenanc'd by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Holy Character, and the Violence supported by a Text.</p>

But the Witnesses Swore Home, and one of them Extream Positive, that if his House at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant were but narrowly Search'd for Men and Arms, they would find such a Provision, that the Modern Discoveries at <hi>Tichbourn</hi> and <hi>Flixham,</hi> were Nothing to't. The Pretended Criminal began now to Moralize upon the Story, and so away goes he to his Majesty; casts himself at his Feet, and promises that if he might but have as Ample a Pardon, as other Witnesses to <hi>Consults</hi> have had before him, he would shew him the very Bottom of the Plot. I cannot deny, says he, but I have a great many of the Enemies of your Royal Crown and Dignity at this time Conceal'd in my House; and if your Majesty shall be pleased to appoint any Person to make Seizure of them, they shall be immediately Delivered up. So the Prince Order'd a Squadron of his Guards, and a Trusty Officer in the Head of 'em, to go along with him. The Gentleman led them very Frankly to his Coffers, and shew'd them his Treasure. These are the Traytors, says he, that you are to take care of, and pray be pleas'd to <hi>see that they may be kept in safe Custody till they shall be Delivered by Due Course of Law.</hi>

                  <p>THE Story of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Naboth</hi> comes directly to the Point of this Fable; that is to say, as to the King and Subject, with the Iniquity of the Subornation and Practice: Only the one was a Poor Subject, and the other a Rich, which does not one jot alter the Morality of the Case. The Old Saying, that [<hi>Mony does all things,</hi>] is not much wide of the Truth; for it gives, and it takes away; it makes Honest Men and Knaves; Fools and Philosophers; and so forward <hi>Mutatis Mutandis,</hi> to the End of the Chapter. There's not any Corruption in Nature, but Mony is at one end on't; The whole World is under the Dominion of it; for all things under the Sun are Bought and Sold. But as it gives Men Reputation, so it brings People into Snares and Dangers too; It exposes them to Factions, Robbers, Cheats, Knights of the Post, and the like: It fills their Heads and their Hearts with Cares and Disquiets. And what at last are all the Baggs and Possessions that Rich Men take so much Pride and Pleasure in, but Spunges Deposited in their own Hands, 'till there shall be occasion to Squeeze them for the Publick Use!</p>

is Clear, Strong and Edifying: We are either not to Fear Death at all, or to Fear it every moment of our Lives; nay, and in all the Forms that ever it appear'd in, which will put us to such a stand, that we shall not dare even to Live for fear of Dying. We must neither Eat, nor Drink, nor Breathe, nor Sleep, if we come once to Boggle at Presidents, and at the doing of those things over again, that ever any Man dy'd of before. There is not one instant of Life in fine, but may be our Last. Beside, that we Live, not only in the daily Danger of Death, but in a continual Certainty of it: So that the Question is not how, or of what this or that Man Dy'd, but the Inevitable Fate and Mortality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.

He that sets the Anxiety, Fears and Dangers that accompany Riches, against the Chearful and the Easie Security of a Private Fortune and Condition, may very well be Thankful for the One, without Repining at the other. He that sets his Heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing in this World, makes himself a Slave to his Hopes and
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:66024:213"/>
Fears, and is as sure of being Disappointed, as he is of the Uncertainty of Human Affairs. Let it be Love, Preferment, Court-Favours, Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, or what else it will, some Rival or other he must expect to meet with in all his Pretensions. The Proud Man's Inclination is Glory, High Place in the World, and the Applause of the People. The Envious Man's Heart is set upon doing Shrew'd Turns, Defamatory Calumnies and Revenge. In few Words, Violent Affections never fail of being Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie and Importune: But of all Extravagant Passions, the Love of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> is the most Dangerous, in regard of the greatest Variety of Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that attend it. There may be some few Pretenders to a Beautiful Lady; some few Candidates for the favour of a Popular Choice. But these are Competitions that Intermit, and go off and on as it happens, upon this or that Occasion. But <hi>Mony is an Universal Mistress;</hi> Men are always Watching, Spying, and Designing upon't; and all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of Worldly Wisdom are perpetually at Work about it: So that whosoever is Possess'd of, and Sollicitous for that Interest, shall never Close his Eyes, so long as Craft, Violence, or Conspiracy, shall be able to keep them Waking.</p>

The Philosopher in this Instance, was not without some Difficulty how to gain his Point: There were better Fish at the Table, and the Question was how to come at them, without being either Rude or Importune; and yet if he were not clear enough to be Understood, he was in danger still to lose his Longing. So that he found out such a way of Asking, as to Provoke a Question without Speaking a Word to't; and he did it in such a Fashion of Respect too, that it might not look like Begging on the one Hand, or Reproaching on the other. And he was much in the Right once again too, when the Riddle was already set afoot, rather to wait till the Explanation should be Desir'd, then to Prompt the Master of the Feast to Call for't.</p>

But let the Oppression be never so Sanguinary, there's no Appeal left from the Tyranny; for if a General Insurrection had been thought Lawful, the Fable would not have made the Case so Desperate: So that this is only to Insinuate the Sacredness of Power, let the Administration of it be what it will: And the Reason of it is so plain, that it is impossible for Human Frailty to be better Secur'd then it is by the Determinations of Providence in this Particular. An Unlimited Power 'tis true is a strong Temptation, and where 'tis Screw'd up to the Highest Pitch, 'tis a great Unhappiness; but it is not for Men that have their Fortunes and their Stations in this World Assign'd them, to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves to be their own Carvers, and to Grumble at the Orders and Resolutions of their Masters and Rulers.

                  <p>THIS (says <hi>Camerarius,</hi>) is to reprove the Practices of perverse Courts, and Extravagant Princes.</p>
                  <p>It is the proper Bus'ness of <hi>Mythology</hi> to Point out, and Represent the Images of Good and Evil, and under those Shadows to Teach us what we ought to do, and what not, either Severally and Apart, or as Members of a Society; that is to say, Simply, as Men in a State of Right Nature, or as Parents, or Children, Masters, or Servants, Husbands or Wives, Rulers or Subjects, Friends, Countrymen, Relations, and the like. Now as there are Good and Bad of all sorts; so their Virtues and their Vices, their good Behaviour and their Misdemeanors are to be set forth, Circumstanc'd and Distinguish'd in such sort, as by Rewards or Punishments, to Encourage the One, and to Discountenance the Other, in proportion to the Dignity of the Action, or the Degree of the Offence; by Conferring Marks and Characters of Honour, Offices of Trust, or Beneficial Commissions on the one hand, and by inflicting Sentences of Shame, Infamy, Pains Corporal, or Pecuniary on the other. Without this Distribution, one main end of Emblem is lost; neither is it the true Figure of Life. For Wicked Men, False Brethren, Unnatural Parents, Disobedient Children, Barbarous Husbands, Undutiful Wives, Tyrannical, Weak or Fantastical Governors; Rebellious Subjects, Cruel Masters, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Servants, Perfidious Kindred and Acquaintance: All these Lewd Characters are as Absolutely necessary to the Perfecting of the Design, as the most Laudable Excellencies in Nature.</p>
                  <p>In this Fable of the Kingdom of <hi>Apes,</hi> the Author according to <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarius,</hi> intended the Picture of an Extravagant Government, where he gives Flattery and Corruption the Advantages that in Policy and Justice belong to Services of Honour and of Truth: And at the same time De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers up a Man of Honesty, Justice and Plain Dealing to be torn to Pieces. This Kingdom of <hi>Apes</hi> has been Moralliz'd a Thousand and a Thousand times over in the Practice of the World, and such as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is, such will be the Stream. Let Government it self be never so Sacred, Governors are still but Men; and how necessary and Beneficial soever the Order is at all Hands Confess'd to be, the Officers yet, and the Administrators are but Flesh and Blood, and liable to the Passions and Frailties of other Mortals.</p>
                  <p>There are in fine, many Distempers, Errors, and Extravagances, that shew themselves in the Exercise of Political Powers; as an inexorable Rigour for the Purpose, or as <hi>Lasche</hi> a Demission of Sovereign Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. There are Cases of Sensuality, Pleasure, and Appetite, where Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours have only the Name of Rulers, while some over-grown Subject perhaps Usurps upon the Prerogative in effect, and does the worst things
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:66024:219"/>
imaginable in the Name of the Publick. But this rarely happens, save where the Master wants Resolution to check the License and Presumption of a Daring Servant.</p>
                  <p>There is also a certain Manage that leaves all at Six and Seven, and thinks to support Greatness without either Rule, Weight or Measure; and that's a dangerous Point, when Prudence and Fidelity shall turn to Loss, and Wickedness be supported by the Reputation of Favour and Applause. The Misery of these false Measures is excellently well Pointed out to us in this Fable; and consequently the Blessings of a steddy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, where the Ends of Government are Conscientiously observ'd, and the Divine Priviledges of Power maintain'd; and where Truth and Justice are impartially Asserted and Administer'd, and as resolutely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>

not Trust a Covetous Man in Mony Matters, where there's any thing to be Gotten, either by Fraud or Corruption; nor a Vain Man, where there's a Temptation to Popularity.

                  <p>'THIS Fable tells us what Credit is to be given to Witnesses of a False and Lewd Conversation, and that a known Liar is of no Authority in a Judgment of Law, even when he speaks Truth. Where a Brace of Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will be going to Law, none so fit as an <hi>Ape</hi> to try the Cause; and it was a Sentence worthy of such a Judge, to pronounce them both Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which in Equity they were, with a respect to their Character and Reputation; though in Law they could not be so, upon the Fact in Question. If the <hi>Ape</hi> in this Fable had too little regard to the Letter of the Law, we have seen some Cases where more stress has been laid upon the rigour and strictness of it, then Conscientiously did belong to't: For when one Man of an Exemplary Improbity, Charges another of the same Stamp, in a Court of a Justice, he lies under the Disadvantage of a strong Suspicion, even before he is Heard; and People are Prepar'd to Believe the Worst of him by Anticipation, and before his Case is Known. So that the Bare Prejudice is sufficient to turn the Scale, where it was Gold-weight before; unless we Ballance the Improbity of the one, with the Improbity of the other, as the Ape did here in the Fable.</p>
                  <p>We are to understand upon the whole matter, that it is more Advisable to give too Little Credit in a Court of Judicature to Men of Profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Lives, then too Much: For 'tis a Scandal to Publick Justice, to make use of such Instruments for the Supporters of a State.</p>

The Art of Pleasing is not every Man's Talent, neither will the same way of Manage work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Humours alike.

                  <p>We may learn from hence also, that Justice is so Awfully Sacred, that the most Faithless of Men have a secret Veneration for it; for their Uttermost Cruelties are cover'd with the semblance of it; and in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Exercise of the Vice, they Affect the Reputation of the Vertue.

The other Plodding on with his Nose in the Breech of his Leader, as Gravely as One Foot could follow another. While they were Jogging on thus upon the Way, out comes a Band of <hi>Highway-Men</hi> from the next Wood, and falls upon the <hi>Ass</hi> that carried the <hi>Treasure.</hi> They Beat, Wound and Rifle him, and so leave him, without so much as taking the least Notice of his Fellow. Well, (says the <hi>King's Ass,</hi>) and for all this Mischief I may e'en thank my <hi>Mony.</hi> Right, says the other; and it has been my Happiness that I was not thought worth the Robbing.</p>

'Tis the Booty, not the Man, (save only for the Booty's Sake,) that is in Danger. There's either <hi>Mony</hi> or <hi>Monys-worth,</hi> in all the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of Life; for we live in a Mercenary World, and 'tis the Price, in some sort or other, of all things that are in it; but as it certainly draws Envy and Hazzard after it, so there are great Advantages go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it, and great Blessings that attend the right use of it. And so for Poverty too; a narrow Fortune is undoubtedly a Cramp to a great Mind, and lays a Man under a Thousand Incapacities of serving either his Country or his Friend; but it has the Comforts yet of being free from the Cares and Perils that accompany great Masses of Treasure and Plentiful Estates. Beside, that the Virtue of a Generous and a Charitable Tenderness of Nature, is never the less Acceptable to him that takes the Will for the Deed, for want of Ability to put those good Inclinations in Execution.

               </head>
               <p>THere was a Good Woman (in the Days when Good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were in Fashion) that valu'd her self Wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Faculty of Retention, or (for the sake of Good Manners) upon the Admirable Gift she had in the Keeping of a Secret. The Toy took her Husband in the Head once, to make Tryal of her Vertue that way; and so he told her One Morning upon Waking, in the greatest Confidence Imaginable, one of the Strangest Things perhaps that ever was heard of, which had that Night Befall'n him: But my Dear, says he, if you should Speak on't again, I'm utterly Ruin'd; and Women are generally so Leaky, that in the whole Course of my Life, I have hardly met with any one of the Sex that could not hold her Breath longer then she should keep a Secret. Ah, my Life (says she) but your Woman I assure ye, is none of that Number? What? Betray my Husbands Secrets, I'd Dye a Thousand Deaths first. No my Heart, if ever I do, may—Her Husband at that word, stop'd her Mouth, for fear of some Bloody Imprecation, and so told her. Come Wife, says he, <hi>They that will Swear will Lye,</hi> and so I'll rather tell you up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Honour. Look ye here what has befall'n me; I have laid an Egg to Night; and so he took the Egg from his Backside, and bad her Feel on't; but if this should ever come to Light now, People would say that I was Hen-Trod, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of it would make me a Scandal to Mankind. This Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret lay Burning in the Breast of the Poor Woman, and kept her Waking, till she had Day-light enough to Rise by; and then softly out of the Bed she steals, for fear of Waking her Husband, and so away Post-hast to a Gossipping Neighbour of her Acquaintance; Hurries her out of her Bed; Charms and Swears her to Privacy; and then out comes the Secret, That her Husband had laid Two Eggs that very Night. This Confident had another Confident; and there 'twas Three Eggs. The next made it Four; and so it went on (Encreasing still,) from one Gossip to another, 'till by Six a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon they had made it Forty Eggs.</p>

                  <p>There's no such way of Publishing or Proclaiming any thing, as by Enjoyning a Woman under the Seal of Confession to keep it Secret. They that are Curious to <hi>know</hi> Forbidden Secrets, are as Frank of Telling them again, and of Enlarging them: So that whoever shews me a very Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Body, I'll shew him a Blab, and one that shall make a Privacy as Publick as a Proclamation. But if your Wife will have it so, and calls for a Categorical Answer, [<hi>Will ye tell me, or will ye not?</hi>] If you tell the Secret, 'tis odds but in Twelve Hours it shall be Town-Talk, and be made Thirteen times more then 'tis. If you Refuse to tell it, there's no enduring the Exclamations, for want of Trust and Confidence, and the Unaccountable Jealousies that Follow upon't. For there are a sort of People that never consider the many separate Privacies of Trust and Honour, that a Husband cannot honestly Communicate to a Wife, nor a Wife to a Husband: That is to say, where there's a Third Party or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concern'd, apart from any thing in the Question that is Conjugal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them.</p>
                  <p>He that can doubt of the Reason and the Necessity of this Guard and Caution, must be much a Stranger to the History of the Great Rebellion under <hi>Charles the First of Blessed Memory;</hi> when so many State-Intrigues pass'd through the Hands of Women, who are without Dispute the best of Spies, and the most proper Instruments for Discovery and Intelligence: Especially if they be Women of Address, Wit, and Beauty; for the very Sex has certain Privileges upon the Point of a Cavalier-Gallantry and Good Breeding, to cover them from the strictnesses of Search and Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination that other Agents are commonly Subjected to.</p>
                  <p>Now to Reconcile a seeming Contradiction here, in making Women at the same time to be both Fit and Unfit to be Trusted; this Fable does not strike so much at the Futility of Women in General, as at the Incontinent Levity of a Prying Inquisitive Humour; and it falls-in over and above, by way of a Short and Pertinent Digression, to shew that State-Matters are Morally Excepted out of the Articles of Marriage.</p>

                  <p>'TIS a Folly next to Madness for Women to be Trying Masteries with their Husbands; to say nothing of the Scandal they bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Families, by such a Forfeiture of Honour, Discretion, Modesty and Good Manners.

                     <pb n="405" facs="tcp:66024:226"/>There are Divers Important Doctrins Couch'd under this Fable; First, the Insuperable Obstinacy of a Violent Woman. Secondly, The Scandal of the Example, as well as the Folly of the Competition. Thirdly, The Natural Issue of the Controversy, where the Weakest must expect to go to the Wall. The World, Heaven be Thanked, does not want instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to illustrate this Figure. So that there will be less need of Amplify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it. We are not here upon the Philosophy of the Freak, but upon the Shameful Lewdness of the Practice. <hi>Sirrah,</hi> (says a Woman to a Friend of mine, that took her off from Beating her Husband,) <hi>I'm a Wor'stershire Woman, and I won't be Abus'd. Iuvenal's Homo sum,</hi> says all in Two Words. When the Devil of this Passion is Rais'd, there's no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding the Storm, and there's no Laying on't. <hi>One such Womans Tongue</hi> (says the Poet) <hi>is beyond all the Pans and Kettles in the Country, to bring the Moon out of an Eclipse.</hi> Keep up the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> and she Kills you; let it fall, and you Kill <hi>her.</hi> This was the very Case of a Certain Divine that Chid a Woman for striking and Reviling her Husband. She left her Husband immediately, and fell upon the Jacket of the Parson, who stood Gaping at her a full Hour and a Half together, without one word of Reply. The Passion put her at last into Fits, and the first Word she said upon coming to her self again, was no more then this, <hi>Ah Sir,</hi> says she, <hi>Ever while you live Answer a Woman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To come now to the Doctrin that's wrapt up in the Example. 'Tis Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous with a Respect to the Ordinances both of God and Man; 'tis a high Offence to Common Decency, in regard of the Sex, the Duty, and the Relation: And then 'tis most abominably Indiscreet, because if the Man be not a Coxcomb, the Woman is sure to be Worsted; and if he be one, 'tis as good as a <hi>Noverint Universi,</hi> that there's <hi>a Fool and a Shrew well met.</hi> The Word <hi>Yoak-Fellow,</hi> goes a great way with a <hi>Thrush-Woman.</hi> And so does the <hi>Text,</hi> that says, <hi>They shall be both One Flesh.</hi> From whence she infers an Equality at least, if not a Right of Dominion; for the Rib ought to have some Preference above the Clay.</p>
                  <p>This is not to be taken for a General Character of Women, but for a Reproof only of some Eager-Spirited <hi>Gypsies</hi> of the Sex; and for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour also of those Angelical Perfections, which render them both the Joy and the Blessing of Mankind, when they live Suitably in all Points to the Intent of their Creation.</p>

But there's no Man all this while, that sets up for a Knave or a Coxcomb in Direct Terms. Now the Mystery of the Cheat lies in the Artificial Disguising of One thing for Another, and in making Evil pass for Good, and Good for Evil: As every Virtue has its Bordering Vice, and every Vice its Bordering Virtue. So that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is Fair still, let the Practice be never so Foul, and Men will be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring down the Rule to the Error, where they cannot Reconcile the Error to the Rule. When People have once Inverted the Measures of Moral Equity, and Natural Reason, and brought the Question of Right or Wrong, so far as in them lies, to a False Standard, there follows in course, an Envious Malevolence upon the Opposition. As for Example; A Fool Naturally Hates a Philosopher: A Debauchee does as Naturally Hate a Man of good Government, and Moderation.

Why says she, I keep your House clear of Mice. Well, says the Man, but you do't for your Own sake, not for Mine. What work would they make in the Pantry and the Larder, (says she) if it were not for me? And in the mean time (says the Master of the House) You your Self devour the same things that they would have Eaten, Mice and All: But you would fain sham it upon me, that you do me a Service, when in Truth you do me an Injury; and therefore you deserve a double Death; First, For the Fault it self, and then for the Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it.</p>

For what's the Difference betwixt having Nothing at all Originally, and after such or such an Acquisition, having Nothing at all Left? 'Tis but Nothing against Nothing both ways: And the Case has much in it of what we find in an Extream Drought, or a Nauseous Surfeit.

Why says the Rambler, we must e'en beat it out the best we can. Pray'e, says his Companion, Advise well with your Pillow before you Embark in this Adventure. You are going you know not whither, to find out you know not what, or whom: A Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, that slips out of your Arms in the very Grasping at it; a common Prostitute to Fools and Footmen.

but she was still so Busy, and so Private, that there was no coming to the Speech of her.

Here's a Check put upon the Definition of a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> not so much for the <hi>False Doctrin</hi> of the Position, as for the <hi>Scandal</hi> of Exposing Majesty, by the <hi>Innuendo</hi> of so Irreverend a Truth; for the Character of a Crown'd Head ought to be kept Sacred, let the Person be what he will. Here is likewise an other Hint of Caution to us, that in all Liberties of this Nature, we keep clear of the present Times, and be still looking another way, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we mean.</p>
                  <p>As to the Definition of a <hi>Tyrant</hi> it self, let it be Candidly taken, and the Drift of it is this; the common Safety of King and People is wrapt up in the Well-being of each other. The <hi>Prince</hi> intends his <hi>Own</hi> Good in that of the <hi>People;</hi> and at the same time, the Good of the <hi>People</hi> in that of <hi>Himself;</hi> for they Stand or Fall together: But then there's One Tenderness of Care and Duty, and another of Personal Inclination, or (if I may so Call it) Infirmity; and <hi>That's</hi> Aristotle's <hi>Tyrant,</hi> where a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Indulges his Private Appetite, and Sacrifices his People to his Passions or his Pleasures.</p>

How much Worse then Brutes are those Men then, that owe the Best Blood in their Veins to the Bounty of their Friends and Patrons, and yet after Raising them from the very Dunghil to Honours and Fortunes, are the forwardest to Insult upon their Supporters and Masters, when they see 'em in any Calamity; and to add Affliction to Affliction! Now to Pursue the Fable, Here's a Common Enemy, in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, at the Mercy of the People about him; some Beat him, others take Pity of him: He comes afterward to make his Escape, and Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes his Enemies from his Friends, by Destroying the One, and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Other.

He made no Difficulty of Confessing the Fact, and of Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging himself the Publisher of Pernicious and Execrable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions; but withal, says he, no Mortal upon the Face of the

As to the Inventing of those Tenets, he made Protestation, that he had no Hand in't at all, and that the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Part of his Discourses, was only Copy'd out of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Practices and Councils of Christian Princes; and that if they pleas'd, he was ready to Instance in the very Presidents. After this, he appeal'd to the Justice of the Bench, whether it were not very hard to make it Mortal, for One Man to write the Naked History of a thing done; and at the same time to allow the very <hi>Doing</hi> of it to be Praise-worthy in Another. This Plea had brought him off, but for a Fresh Accusation that was Immediately started against him; which was, that he was Taken in the Dark One Night among a Flock of Sheep, putting <hi>Dogs Teeth</hi> into their Mouths, which must enevitably be the Ruin of the Shepherds; for it could never be Expected that the whole Flock would ever submit to the Government of <hi>One,</hi> if it had either Teeth, Wit or Horns.

Her Friends came to Condole with her upon the Tydings of some Dismal Calamity that had Befall'n her, and ask'd her very tenderly what terrible Misfortune it might be, that she laid so heavily to Heart?
