            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all ingenuous People: A ſecond Intimation from the <hi>New <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertakers</hi> for conveyance of Letters at half the rates to ſeverall parts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHereas ſeverall printed Papers have been ſcattered up and down the Cities of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> and in many conſiderable Townes and places in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> intimating, that if any perſons ſend their Letters by the Old Poſt, they will have a free and ſafe going and coming, but if they ſend by the New Undertakers, their paſſage will be interrupted, which we cannot but look upon as a Deſign on purpoſe to deter all perſons from bringing their Letters to us, which Deſign we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is ſtill carried on, as appears by a buſie Pamphleteer in his laſt weekly book of ſeverall Proceedings, in which the ſaid Paper is recited, as if the State had allowed thereof. And though divers perſons imployed by us in the carriage of our Mayle, have of late under falſe colours and pretences been much affronted and interrupted by ſome malitious Poſt-Maſters and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, acting only upon the account of Self-intereſt, yet againſt them we are (upon good advice) proceeding by ſeverall Actions and Indictments, and doubt not of Juſtice and reparation, according to due courſe of Law, all ſuch interruption being contrary to the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>And whereas we have hitherto gone on, and reſolve ſtill to proceed in the management of our honeſt and juſt undertaking (which hath already been ſo ſerviceable to this Nation) in a legall and warrantable way: Now for the future prevention of abuſes and affronts to thoſe perſons that ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by us, and to the end the people of this Nation may not be deceived by thoſe falſe ſuggeſtions and pretences, which hitherto have been publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to delude them and abuſe us; We whoſe names are hereunto ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, being the firſt Undertakers for the ſpeedy conveyance of Letters at half the Rates to ſeverall parts of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> do hereby declare to all Gentlemen, Merchants, and other perſons whatſoever, that we do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend reſolvedly (by the help of God) to continue the management of this our undertaking, and for the further accommodation of all men of buſineſſe, and for improvement of Trade, to carry to places not formerly ſupplied, with the like conveyance; as alſo to add one day more weekly for the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Letters, (that is to ſay) <hi>Thurſdaies</hi> as well as <hi>Tueſdaies</hi> and <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies,</hi> and to have returns anſwerably, the firſt <hi>Thurſday</hi> to begin the 28. of this preſent <hi>April,</hi> and the ſame places of receipt to continue as formerly, we having received much incouragement by ingenuous and publike minded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and no diſcouragement at all from Supreme Authority, nor can it rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally be imagined, that ever they will countenance the Diſturbers of ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and beneficiall an undertaking.</p>
