            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S thou doest Reade, so practise to Vnderstand, and make vse of thy Labour: Let not this Knowledge vanish away like a Dreame, but keepe it as a Monument in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in Brasse or Marble. This is a strange Chronicle, written by a strong hand: The best Antiquary in the World hath set it downe, for God himselfe puts his owne Name to it: A few leaues of his Filling, are an ample Volume: Euery small Epitome Written by him, is a Booke in Folio. Here thou shalt finde no great number of Lines, but much more Matter comprehended in them, then the Words seeme to carry. This is but a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a Battaile fought in the Aire: A naked Description of a terrible Fight; feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full no doubt to the Standers by; but it may be
<pb facs="tcp:1753:3"/>
Comfortable to thee, if heereby thou getst thy selfe Arm'd to Combate with thy sinnes, for questionlesse vppon some such occasions grew this Quarrell; which may easily be taken vp, if thou (and euery one of vs) submit our selues, confesse wherein wee are faulty, and so plead for Attonement.</p>
            <p>Nothing is here presented to thine eyes, to fright thee, but to fill thee with Ioy, that this Storme fell so farre off, and not vppon thine owne Head. Yet beware, for the same Hand holds a Rod to strike euery one that deserues punishment. Pray to Heauen to free Thee from it; and so wishing thee the strong heart of a true Christian, to beare with Patience, what thy Selfe shalt feele, and to pitty others, I bid thee farewell.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1753:4"/>
wee dance and sing in the midst of our Follies. So blinde are wee in the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of Heauenly matters, that wee cannot see our way to Goodnesse, but runne head-long into the Pathes of our owne euerlasting vndoing. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers haue not the skill to fright vs; Death onely is the Man, that can doe good vpon vs: And yet, though Death knockes at our very Doores, nay; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit wee see him sit at our Bed-side, yet the hope of Life, playes her idle, vayne, and wanton Musicke vnder our Windowes.</p>
            <p>Into what a miserable Sea of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties does a man then throw himselfe, when in this his earthly Nauigation, hee sayles he cares not how, nor knowes where to finde a safe Landing-place.</p>
            <p>Wee had neede therefore to make much of vnderstanding, wise, and skilfull Pilots, for the best of vs all is an ignorant Marriner. Apt enough
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1753:4"/>
we are, to run vpon Rockes and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands; but an excellent Sea-man is hee, that in all weathers can beare vp Sayle, and by the vertue of his good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, is able to auoyde such mortall Dangers.</p>
            <p>The foure Elements haue beene Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to vs, yet wee get (or at least, shew) little amendment by the Doctrin, they haue Read vnto vs. The <hi>Earth,</hi> (once fruitfull) hath of late yeares felt the curse of <hi>Barrennesse:</hi> Her wombe hath beene the deuourer of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of her owne Children; shee has not playd the part of a Mother, but a Step-dame, for insteed of strong wines, shee hath bin drunke with bloud.</p>
            <p>How hath the other Element of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beene troubled? What Monsters hath the Sea brought forth? The sonnes of Murder, Rapine, Fury, and Pyracy. As for <hi>Fire,</hi> it hath denied of late to warme vs, but at vnreasonable rates, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame hard conditions. But what talke

The <hi>Aire</hi> hath bin infected, and millions haue dropd into Graues, by sucking in her mortall poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The <hi>Aire</hi> is the shop of Thunder and Lightning: In that, hath of late bin held a Muster of terrible enemies, and threatners of Vengeance, which the great Generall of the Field, who Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts and Commands all such Armies, <hi>(God Almighty, I meane)</hi> auert from our Kingdome, and shoote the arrowes of his indignation some other way, vpon the bosomes of those that would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found his Gospell.</p>
            <p>Now, albeit that these foure great quarter-masters of the World (<hi>the foure Elements</hi>) haue in former times, and in this of our owne, bin in ciuill Warres one against another, and bent their Forces at the Heart of this Kingdome;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1753:5"/>
yet how happy are we, to eate our bread in Peace, and to drinke our wholesome and sweete Waters? No <hi>Nation</hi> beneath the <hi>Sunne</hi> hath more cause to sing Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to <hi>God,</hi> and send vp Thankes to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen then ours.</p>
            <p>The Drum beates here, but the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes are abroad: The Barbed Horse tramples not downe our Corne-fieldes: The earth is not manurde with mans Bloud (as it was in the Warres of the Barons; and those of the two Royall contending Families, of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster.</hi>) Here we presse Souldiers; but other Countries beare the burthen of their Armies. Heere they kindle their Match, but the fire is not giuen, till they come into Forraigne King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>This Security yet must not bee suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to rocke vs fast asleepe; and so with <hi>Sampson,</hi> to haue our strength cut from vs, by the Strumpet of our carelesnes: For albeit, our Gates haue no Canons

            <p>Let vs turne to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> will not turne his Face from vs: Say thy sinnes were as blacke as Hell; yet <hi>Repentance</hi> shall make them like the Winges of a Doue, couer'd (<hi>as the Kingly Prophet sings</hi>) with siluer, the Wings bearing the colour of yellow Gold. <hi>Repentance</hi> is able to make the soule as white as the snow in <hi>Zalmon</hi>;<note place="margin">

            <div type="part">
               <head>Looke vp therefore now; and see a New Wonder.</head>
               <p>THE name of the Towne is <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> (in <hi>Barkeshire</hi>) some eight miles from <hi>Oxford.</hi> Ouer this Towne, vpon <hi>Wensday</hi> being the ninth of this instant Moneth of <hi>April</hi> 1628. about fiue of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone. This miraculous, prodigious, and fearefull handy-worke of God was presented, to the astonishable amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1753:9"/>
of all the beholders, Men, Women, and children, being many in number.</p>
               <p>The weather was warme, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great shewe of distemperature, only the skye waxed by degrees a little gloomy, yet not so darkned but that the Sunne still and anon, by the power of the brightnesse, brake through the thicke clouds, and made them giue way to the Maiesty of his beames.</p>
               <p>A gentle gale of wind then blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from betweene the <hi>West</hi> and <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west;</hi> in an instant was heard, first a hideous rumbling in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> and presently after followed a strange and fearefull peale of Thunder, running vp and downe these parts of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,</hi> but it strake with the loudest vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and more furious tearing of the <hi>Ayre,</hi> about a place called <hi>The white Horse h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll,</hi> than in any other. The whole order of this <hi>thunder,</hi> carried a kind of Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall state with it, for it maintayned <hi>(to the affrighted Beholders seeming)</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:1753:10"/>
the fashion of a fought Battaile.</p>
               <p>It beganne thus: First, for an on-set, went on one great <hi>Cannon</hi> as it were of <hi>thunder</hi> alone, like a warning peece to the rest, that were to follow. Then a little whileafter, was heard a second; and so by degrees a third, vntill the number of 20. were discharged (or there abouts) in very good order, though in very great terror.</p>
               <p>In some little distance of time after this, was audibly heard the sound of a Drum beating a Retreate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Amongst all these angry peales, shot off from Heauen; this begat a wonderful admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that at the end of the report of euery cracke, or <hi>Cannon-thundering,</hi> a hizzing Noyse made way through the <hi>Ayre,</hi> not vnlike the flying of <hi>Bullets</hi> from the mouthes of great Ordnance: And by the iudgement of all the terror-stricken witnesses, they were <hi>Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts.</hi> For one of them was seene by many people, to fall at a place called
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1753:10"/>
                  <hi>Bawlkin Greene,</hi> beeing a mile and a halfe from <hi>Hatford:</hi> Which <hi>Thunder-bolt</hi> was by one Mistris <hi>Greene,</hi> caused to be digged out of the ground, she being an eye-witnesse amongst many other, of the manner of the falling.</p>
               <p>The forme of the <hi>Stone</hi> is three-square, and picked in the end: In colour out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly blackish, some-what like Iron: Crusted ouer with that blacknesse about the thicknesse of a shilling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Within, it is soft, of a gray colour, mixed with some kind of minerall, shining like small peeces of glasse.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Stone</hi> brake in the fal: The whole peece is in weight nineteene pound and a halfe: The greater peece that fell off, weigheth fiue pound, which with other small peeces being put together, make foure and twenty pound and better.</p>
               <p>At the hearing of this horrid <hi>Thunder,</hi> all men (especially about <hi>Sheffington</hi>) were so terrified, that they fell on their knees, and not onely thought, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1753:11"/>
sayd, that verily <hi>the day of Iudgement was come.</hi> Neyther did these feares take hold only of the people, but euen Beasts had the selfe-same feeling and apprehension of danger, running vp and downe, and bellowing, as if they had bin mad.</p>
               <p>It is in the Countrey credibly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that some other <hi>Thunder-stones</hi> haue bin found in other places: But for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, there was one taken vp at <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe,</hi> and is now in the custody of the <hi>Shriefe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many do constantly affirme, that the shape of a <hi>Man, beating of a Drum,</hi> was visibly seene in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> but this wee leaue to prooue.</p>
               <p>Others report that he, who digged vp the <hi>Stone in Bawlkin Greene,</hi> was at that instant stricken lame, but <hi>(God bee thanked)</hi> there is no such matter.</p>
               <p>Report in such distractions as these, hath a thousand eyes, and sees more than it can vnderstand; and as many tongues, which being once set a going,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1753:11"/>
they speake any thing. So now a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people report there were three <hi>Sunnes</hi> seene in the <hi>Element</hi>; but on the contrary side, they are opposers against them, that will affirme they beheld no such matter, and that it was not so. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it were, how oftentimes haue three <hi>Sunnes,</hi> foure; nay fiue, and sometimes more appeared in the <hi>Ayre,</hi> both in <hi>England,</hi> and other Countries round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout vs?

               <p>Howsoeuer, it is not fit that any man, should take vppon him, to write too broad and busie Comments on any such Textes as these Let vs not be so daring as to pry into the closet of <hi>Gods determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</hi> His <hi>workes are full of Wonders, and not to be examined</hi>: Let vs not be so foolish, as turne <hi>Almanacke-makers,</hi>
