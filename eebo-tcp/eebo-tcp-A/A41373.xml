            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS following Treatise, a Grand-Child of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> (the Off-spring and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan of a near and dear Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) coming to my Hands as his next of Kin, might well (as it did) claim from me a Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianship

and Preservation; which once (consulting withal my own Interest) I was wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved on with an Intention to have kept it Curiously, Private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Tenderly, as the sole Heir to some goodly Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: But, at length, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that so to do would be to contradict the publick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and well Meaning of its Parent (who intended nothing less (as appears by his Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Epistle, and indeed by both beginning, middle and ending of the Book) than that his Son should be thus private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and nicely Cloistered up at Home; but rather that he Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, be enur'd to Labour and Hardship, and pass through Fire and Water, that thereby, in time, he may be Qualified to do his Countrey Service). I

have therefore, abandoning (as Reason should) such tender Indulgence, and self-conceited Interest, exposed him to the capricious Humours of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant World to take his Fortune; supposing that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after his Clothes will sit ne'er the worse on his Back. But I have, I must confess, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Fault in not sending him first (as was intended) for his Credentials, and am affraid it will fare the worse with him on that account; I beg therefore Pardon, and heartily desire he may not be too hardly Censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for my Neglect. As for his own Faults I need not, I presume, be so importunate; for he is a prity toward Lad, will prattle to you of Gold and Silver, and the <hi>Philosophers Stone,</hi> he will tell you the Iron


<pb facs="tcp:47418:4"/>
Age is passing off the Stage of the World, and that a Golden one succeeds in Order; and (as I am told) can talk Natural Philosophy, surpassing many of his tender Years. It may be, some Men, besides the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher,</hi> will not be able to through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to understand him; yet he speaks plain <hi>English,</hi> as well as ordinary <hi>Latin;</hi> and can call the Planets by their Names; for all his Ancestors (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self) were learned Men; therefore I entertain a good Hope of my Kinsman, for he has told me he will make it his Business to find out those Honourable Persons, to whose Service his Father had devoted him; (and beg their Pardon in my stead) as also his learned Relations of the Ancient Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>I wish it prove true; and hope, <hi>Courterous Reader,</hi> you may be one of that Profession; but whether you are or no, I desire you will Encourage the Youth a little, in his Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and give him a good Heartning: Yet if he pretend to tell you Lies in Matter of Fact, pray correct him; but have a Care, for his Name is <hi>Mercury,</hi> and he will be apt to give you the slip; if you do him any good Office, he may, perhaps, live to requite you Tenfold:

               <p>NOT to trouble our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with the Names or Writings of those many Ancient and Excellent <hi>Philosophers,</hi> who first Treated of this most Noble Art (seeing they writ very obscurely; and those Obscurities, by Collection, are swell'd into very large Volumes.) I will descend to such of them as are accounted <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,</hi> and particularly to those, who have made Explication, for the sake and instruction of the Ingenious: And of


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47418:13"/>
those, none I presume more Learned, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially more Generous, than they of the <hi>English</hi> Nation, how carelesly soever, their Works are look'd upon in this our <hi>Iron age:</hi> If any Man will contend for it, he has the liberty to produce his Proofs; but before I bring you to plain matter of Sense, give me leave to touch a little upon the accidents of Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medley, and the down right Nonsense of conceited Ignorance; I mean such Authors as either by chance have pick'd up some Sentences proper enough in themselves, but yet disorderly applyed, and therefore lead to confusion, or else such as are not only Improper, but also Unnatural, and therefore are grosly Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</p>
               <p>Of the first sort are many of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections in the six Volumes of <hi>Theatrum Chemicum,</hi> by <hi>Lazarus Zetznerus, Fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciculus Chemicus, Cheiragogia Heliana, Zeroasters Cave,</hi> or an Intellectual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, and the like.</p>
               <p>The second sort are they, who only gather up the glimmering <hi>Recipes</hi> and <hi>Decipes,</hi> which are here and there Scattered on purpose, by the Jocose, to catch the unwary in their own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, throwing to them the Shells, but reserving the Kernels for their


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47418:13"/>
Friends, the cautious and diligent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers. Andyet these mistaken ones, fondly supposing themselves true Adep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, immediatly thereupon cry out, <hi>Sirs, Wee will shew you</hi> Diana <hi>Naked, for we have caught her in our Volumes;</hi> When alas! She is slipt from their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, having first Metamorphosed such daring Sophisters, not as she did <hi>Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eon</hi> into a swift sooted Beast with large Horn's, but into another sort as oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitly dull and slow with long Ears: and yet forsooth they cease not to cry out, <hi>Here are the Menstruums of</hi> Diana, <hi>here is</hi> Circulatum Majus &amp; Minus, <hi>here are the Secrets of the more Secret</hi> Chemy. A Catologue of <hi>Menstruums,</hi> in four Books, under four and twenty Heads, and of four and twenty Kinds, all collected form the Writings of the <hi>Adepts;</hi> These my Friends (say they) are the <hi>Menstruums</hi> of <hi>Diana,</hi> for <hi>Diana</hi> has superfluity of <hi>Menstruums,</hi> she hath Simple, Vegetable <hi>Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums,</hi> made of <hi>Philosophical</hi> Wine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, others of the Spirit of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical</hi> Wine, and the hottest Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, Herbs, Flowers, Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being Oyly.</p>
               <p>Also, Simple Mineral <hi>Menstruums</hi> made of the matter of <hi>Philosophical</hi> Wine


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47418:14"/>
only, others of that and acid Spirits, as <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> Spirit of <hi>Nitre</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Also, Mineral <hi>Menstruums</hi> Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Vegetable, and Mineral <hi>Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> mixed together; <hi>Cum multis aliis quae nunc perscribere longum est.</hi>

               <p>If Men will be seduced by such Slipp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slop-Sawse-makers, no wonder if at last they say, <hi>All is Vanity and Vexation of Chymists:</hi> But let us look upon them, and their fond followers no otherwise than meer <hi>Foolosophers,</hi> catch'd in a <hi>Mouse-trap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This by way of removing the Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish, next we proceed to lay a sure Foundation for the Ingenious to Build on.</p>
               <p>This Art, I say, and doubt not to <note place="margin">The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this Art.</note> make clearly appear, consists in the true knowledge of a <hi>Metalline</hi> Sulphur and Mercury, which are to be Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of four <hi>Metalline</hi> Principles or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>viz. Metalline Fire, Air, Earth</hi> and <hi>Water;</hi> all to be reduced into a quick, running, clear, and splendid <hi>Mercury;</hi> In which <hi>Mercury</hi> is contain'd the Grand Secret of the <hi>Philosophers, viz.</hi> their <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> for then they say, <hi>Est in Mercurio quicquid quaerunt Sapientes;</hi> All is in <hi>Mercury</hi> that the


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47418:14"/>
Wise men seek: Because this prepared <hi>Mercury</hi> may easily be digested into Silver and Gold; and then also, and not till then, is this saying verified, <hi>Est<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tamen unum,</hi> &amp;c. That there is in the <hi>Metalick</hi> Kingdom one thing of a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Original, in which our <hi>Sol</hi> is nearer, than in Common <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> if you seek it in the hour of its Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c. Introit apert. pag.</hi> 51. Which will melt in our <hi>Mercury,</hi> as will Ice in warm Water; and yet it hath resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with Gold. The same thing may be found by digestion in our <hi>Mercury</hi> for the spaee of an hundred and fifty days, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Secrets Reveal'd, pag.</hi> 75. For this <hi>Mercury</hi> so digested into <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> will again easily be dissolved in that <hi>Mercury</hi> from whence it was form'd: Whereas to dissolve Common Gold by prepared <hi>Mercury,</hi> is a Work of great difficulty, and ought not to be attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any, unless he be an experienced Master in this Art, and yet he that so operates, shall labour for the worst and not the better, unless he knows how to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on both works a part, and afterwards in a due measure to Reconjoyn them.</p>
               <p>This I say, is the Scope and Intention of all the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> and now it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that I clear my Position.</p>

is Compounded of many things, but yet they are but one thing made of divers created Substances of one Essence, that is to say,</p>

               <p>This will better appear in the <hi>11th.</hi> Chap. pag. 18. <hi>De Inventione perfecti Magisterij,</hi> where he tells you, That the first Inquirers into this <hi>Magistery,</hi> sought only how they might exalt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Metals to the nature of Gold, and perceiving, that all <hi>Metallick</hi> Bodies were of a <hi>Mercurial</hi> Original, and that <hi>Mercury</hi> was both as to its Weight and Homogeneity most like unto Gold, which is the perfectest of Metals; They therefore endeavoured to digest it to the maturity of Gold, that in order to this and to purify <hi>Mercury,</hi> they sought for <note place="margin">1.</note>

and found an active <hi>Metalline</hi> Sulphur <note place="margin">2.</note> in the House <hi>Aries,</hi> which they gave to the Off-spring or Child of <hi>Saturn</hi> (which <note place="margin">3.</note> Child abounded with the most Purged Salt of Nature, but had before no <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline</hi> Sulphur in it) that then they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to purge <hi>Mercury</hi> with this prepared Matter or Air, but could not effect it, because they would not mix, therefore they contemperated this Air by the Doves of <hi>Diana,</hi> and then the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent was answerable to their desires; <note place="margin">4.</note> and that this <hi>Mercury</hi> in its Coagulation yeilded them pure <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now to make the Planets Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade, here is <hi>Mercury</hi> the last Element, united by the Doves of <hi>Diana,</hi> to the Off-spring of <hi>Saturn,</hi> who was purified by a <hi>Metalline</hi> Sulphur or Fire; all which amounts to no more than a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the four <hi>Metalline</hi> Elements, Water, Earth, Air and Fire. With this agrees the works of Prince <hi>Geber</hi> in his Medicines of the first, second, and third Orders.</p>

               <p>In his Exposition upon Sir <hi>George Ripleys</hi> Epistle, in <hi>pag.</hi> 20. of this Book, he writes thus,</p>
               <p>Take then the most beloved Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Saturne,</hi> whose Arms are a <hi>Circle Argent,</hi> on it a <hi>Sable Cross</hi> on a <hi>Black Feild,</hi> which is the Signal note of the <hi>Great World,</hi> Espouse her to the most Warlike God, who dwells in the House of <hi>Aries,</hi> and thou shalt find the Salt

               <p>And in the same Book in his Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the <hi>Praeface</hi> of Sir <hi>George Riply, pag.</hi> 7. He saith of the Fire,</p>
               <p>That it inhabits, the Fiery <hi>Dragon,</hi> and it yeilds its Soul to the true <hi>Saturnia,</hi> and is Embraced by it, and both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one together, bearing the Stamp of the Most High, even the Oriental <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the Son of the Morning: This Soul is <hi>Chalybs Magical Volatile,</hi> and <note place="margin">Chalybs</note> very tender, the true <hi>Minera</hi> of <hi>Sol,</hi> out of which <hi>Sol</hi> Naturally proceeds, which I my self know to be true, and have spoken of it in my little <hi>Latin</hi> Treatise called, <hi>Introitus apertus ad oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusum Regis palatium.</hi>

               <p>Also in his Treatise of <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Supernatural</hi> things, he says, <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> can perform nothing to attain <note place="margin">

               <p>This also may suffice, to shew that all the <hi>Philosophers</hi> are upon one and the same Foundation, and do mean one and the same thing, and process.</p>
               <p>The Purifying and Joyning of these two first Principles is contain'd in the gross or foul work, as appears by <hi>Norton</hi> in his <hi>Ordinal. Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>Theat. Chem.

               <p>These two Principles he also calls two Stones.</p>
               <p>In Chap. 3. Pag. 41. Speaking to <hi>Tonsile,</hi> he saith,</p>

               <p>Thus you see how the ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were Sworn not to discover their Rock of clear Water, and that this Work is the highest piece of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy

in Nature. This Water is made of the four Elements said <hi>Plato;</hi> so is the joyning of the two first Principles said to be the mixing of the four Elements; the one being Hot and Dry, the other Cold and Moist. This Water is also called <hi>Aqua Divina, Aqua Benedicta, Aqua Coelestis, (&amp;c.)</hi> with many other Names.</p>
               <p>One Author (that shall be nameless) speaking of the Conjunction of these two Principles, saith it is a <hi>Magistery,</hi> and calleth the first the Divine Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the second he calls <hi>Mercury,</hi> and saith that the Addition of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, that is Quintessence, goeth through the <hi>Mercury,</hi> and remaineth with it; and seeing that Quintessence belongeth to Life, it changeth the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> so that now <hi>Mercury</hi> is nothing else but Life also; and this Operation is done very quickly, without any ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Working, for as every Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man adorneth his Work, and giveth it his Mark, by the which the Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece is known, so also God Marketh this his Creation, and giveth it the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest Sign that is in Heaven. (&amp;c.)</p>
               <p>So, now you have his Words, you may easily find out the Man. He also calls this Matter (being purged) <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi>


                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:47418:34"/>
so soon (saith he) as <hi>Mercury</hi> perceiveth the power of God <hi>Sol,</hi> it is no longer <hi>Mercury</hi> but <hi>Luna,</hi> that this <hi>Mercury</hi> is wholly changed and turn'd about; so that was inward is drawn out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but no part separated from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what needeth many Words, you have the thing before so sufficiently described, that I may say, he that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thereby easily name it, savoureth nothing at all of Ingenuity.</p>
               <p>This Soul (saith my Master) as it is drawn from the <hi>Saturnia</hi> sollid and dry, is called our Air, or rather the Chamelion, which is an Airy Body (but indeed it hath a hundred other Names.)</p>
               <p>This, says he, is true Sulphur which is imbibed by the <hi>Mercuriality</hi> of <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and Notes it with the Regal Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net; and being united and revived into a <hi>Mineral</hi> Water, by the mediation of <hi>Dianas</hi> Doves, it is the sharp Spirit, which in the Water, moves the Body to putrefie, <hi>&amp;c</hi> [Thus is made a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of the first Order by Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.]</p>

Fermental, begets in the common Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury an Off-spring more Noble than it self, which is our true Hermaphrodite, which will congeal it self, and dissolve the Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>But beyond the Example or Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude given of a Grain of Corn, it may be observed that the hidden and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Vertue of this our Body, doth purge and putrefie its Matrix of Water, <note place="margin">Purged.</note> in which it is sown; that is, it makes it cast forth a great quantity of filthy Earth, and a great deal of hydropical saline Moisture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For (says he) this Operation of ours, is made between Male and Female, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">By a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Vertue.</note> their own kind; between which there is a Ferment, which affecteth that which no other thing in the World could do.</p>

                     <p>I call this Conjunction Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traptive; yet I perceive that at the first Addition it rather goes under the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of Triptative, or Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of three Substances, by virtue of a Medium, because the Medium re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains not intirely with the other, and that the Terrap<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ive Conjunction is not properly consummate till perfect Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: This therefore may be properly called the making of a Quadrangle; and that of perfect Digestion, a redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Quadrangle to a Circle; as you have it in the Exposition upon Sir <hi>G.

                  </sp>
                  <p>You also, Sir, further teach that by virtue of the Medium or Doves of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> all these four Principles, or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will joyn and purge together, which then must be purified into a bright, clear Water, by several Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations or Eagles, which may be done

several ways, as your Writings suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently direct: Also that these several Sublimations are but so many Cohoba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the subliming Mercury upon the Body of the Composition; yet that there requires a due knowledge of the true Number which may also be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learnt from your Directions; and therefore, for brevities sake, I shall not hear repeat them.</p>
                  <p>This is that hidden Moisture or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, wherein Gold will dissolve as Ice doth melt in warm Water, and is a Mother unto Gold, as saith <hi>Sendivog.</hi> Eng. <hi>pag.</hi> 49.</p>
                  <p>I am also, in the next place, further to shew that this purified Mercury or Water, is not unlike to common <note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Mercury Phils.</note> Mercury; yet more splendid and clear, but not diaphanous or limped, as many have supposed: And that upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Mercury alone is founded the grand Secret of the Philosophers Stone; <hi>alias</hi> Gold-making Powder; <hi>alias</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting Elixir; which with your leave I will prove, as follows.</p>

                  <p>This, I say, that it must first be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hobated in a very wonderful way (for <note place="margin">Cohobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> it is such a Cohobation, that hath not its like in the World) and for several times, to a determinate Number; and after it may and ought to be Distilled <note place="margin">Distillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>

                  <p>The next Property of thy VVater, is that it must be thin, even as thin as <note place="margin">Thinness.</note> any other Mercury; for if the external Proportion be Corrupted, it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Sign that the inward Nature is Confused.</p>

                  <p>By way of Digression, give me leave <note place="margin">☜</note> to tell you, It is no small matter to be firmly grounded in your Principles.

This Man sets out some of the Cheats of sophistical Multipliers and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.

for although he allows, that without it, this Art could never have been found: He notwithstanding adds, Not that it can be made the philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Dissolvent by any preparation whatsoever, but without it the first Dissolvent; (for there are three) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be gotten; for it only hath the Power to separate this mineral Spirit from a crude Mineral, taken from the <hi>Mine,</hi> which the Fire hath not touched; and no other thing under Heaven can do it else, no more than any Creature besides a Bee can extract Hony out of a Flower.—By this, I easily perceive, he spoke only by ghuess; and I am affraid <hi>England</hi> is not one bit the Happier for all his great Cunning.</p>

The Stone it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">A hard Labour.</note> may be Easier made, than than that thou mayst find the next matter in Gold commonly bought.</p>
               <p>Wherefore our Gold is the next mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Stone, the common Gold is a near matter, the rest of the Metlas are remote, and those things which are not Metallick are most remote, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther estrang'd to it.</p>

But if thou seek our Gold in a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle matter between the perfect and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, seek it, and thou maist find it; but otherwise loose the Body of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Gold, which is called the first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, by which the Inchantment off the body is loosed, without which the work of the Male cannot be perform'd: If thou goest in the former way, thou <note place="margin">Two ways</note> art bound to proceed with a most benign Fire; but if in the latter, then thou must implore the help of a torrid Vulcan; such a Fire ought to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred as we use in Multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when to perfect our <hi>Elixir,</hi> we Ferment with common Gold or Silver.</p>
               <p>This indeed will be a <hi>Labyrinth,</hi> unless thou knowest how to get thy self out, yet in either progress, thou art in need of an equal and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Heat, whether thou workest in Common Sol or in ours. And thou <note place="margin">Requisit heat.</note> shalt know, that our Sol will perfect the Work two or three Months soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than Common Gold, and it will be an <hi>Elixir</hi> in its first perfection, of a Thousand Fold, which in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will scarce be of a Hundred Fold Vertue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>But if thou does not yet fully know the Mystery of our Sun, having attain'd the knowledge of our Mercury; then take of common Sol, well purged, one part, and of our Mercury, very clear, three parts, joyn them as is said before, and set them to the Fire, giving a heat in which it may boil and sweat, and his sweat may be circulated, and this Day and Night for ninety Days and Nights, and thou shalt see this Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to have separated and again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd all the Elements of the common Sol; boil it afterwards for other fifty Days, and thou shalt see the common Sol to be converted by our Mercury in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Sol, which is a Medicine of the

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47418:61"/>
Contradictions which he hath woven in them, which in this he hath not done in the least Measure. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore resort to them, and see if this our fuddain Rejoycing is built upon a good Foundation, lest we have cause to be sad too late.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Rep. Rev.</hi> pag. 23. He hath these words; <hi>viz.</hi> I know many pitiful Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters do dote on many Stones vegetable, animal and mineral; and some to those add the fiery Angelical Paradaical Stone, which they call a wonder working Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; and because the mark they aim at is so great, the ways also by which they would attain their Scope, they make also agreeable, that is, a double way: One way they call <hi>Via humida,</hi> the other they call <hi>Via sicca,</hi> (to use their Languages) the latter way is the <hi>Labyrinthian Path,</hi> which is fit only for the great ones in the Earth to tread in; the other the <hi>Daedalean Path,</hi> an easie way of small cost for the poor of the World to enterprize.</p>
               <p>But this I know, and can testifie, that there is but one way, and but only one Regimen, no more Colours than ours; and what we say or write other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, is but to deceive the unwary; for


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47418:62"/>
if every thing in the World ought to have its proper Causes, there cannot be any one end, which is produced from two ways of working on distinct Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.—Therefore we protest, and must again admonish the Reader, that (in our former Writings) we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed much, by reason of the two ways we have Insinuated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

What is become now of that rare and easie way reserved for the Saints? Is there then no other way, but this with common Gold? What then is the meaning of all those solemn Sayings in <hi>Introitus Apertus,</hi> and particularly this? [Pag. 54. <hi>Sin. minus, &amp;c.</hi> but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in Sol vulgar with a due heat and in due time thou shalt prepare it; but it is a way hedged with a thousand Briars, and we have made a Vow to God and Equity, that we will never in naked Words declare each Regimen distinctly.] Well, there must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in it, Sense, Reason and Nature, confirming the same; for if our Mercury is crude Gold, and will (if sufficiently accuated) congeal it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self, which is no where denied, What then must it be? Surely nothing else but our Gold, which is nearer related to our Water than any common Gold:—But let me see, what more says my Master in his 19th <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Introit.</hi> [Pag. 53. <hi>Ea propter si artem noris, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore if thou knowest the Art, extract our Sol out of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, then thou maist perfect the Work from one thing; which, believe me, is more perfect than all worldly Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47418:63"/>
according to the Philosopher; if, says he, thou knowest how to make the Work out of Mercury alone, thou shalt verily be the finder out of a most pretious Work. In this Work there are no superfluities; but the whole, by the living God, is turned into Purity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Action is made only in one thing].</p>
               <p>So this indeed is a very good Reason; and now, my Friends, I begin to be a little comforted again, and should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so, were it not for this last Book of <hi>Ripley Revived;</hi> I shall therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be at rest, till I have turned it all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.—Let us see further, perhaps we may find something to fix the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47418:64"/>
he is very obscure, because those three Proportions do serve to three Works. One Work is most Secret, and purely Natural, and is made in our Mercury with our Sol; to which Work belong all the signs described by the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, <note place="margin">Three ways.</note>

               <p>☞ And now, Reader, (I hope) I have made good my Position, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed every particular Principle, or Element, in order even to the Great Work, and that so plainly, that none need hereafter be to seek in any of them. I confess all might have been said in few words, but I have (for a reason parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular) chosen to make the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers themselves discover the true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in their own Language, which also may give great Satisfaction to the diligent Inquirer; and yet I have not dwelt longer upon them than I thought was convenient.</p>
               <p>Next we will view some short Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopical Tracts relating to the Art; which if it will not further confirm you


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47418:70"/>
in what is gon before, may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing serve you for Diversion.</p>
               <p>In the third Volume of <hi>Theatrum Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micum,</hi> the Author <hi>de Magni Lapidis compositione,</hi> tells us that the principle Matter of all <hi>Metals</hi> in their <hi>Mines,</hi> is a dry Water, which they call <hi>Aqua viva,</hi> or <hi>Argentum vivum,</hi> and <hi>Spiritus faetens,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Sulphur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Agens &amp; patiens, pater &amp; mater,</hi> from whence is generated a certain smoaky Substance, and that the <hi>Mineral</hi> Vertue coming upon that <hi>Matter,</hi> congeals and unites it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And from hence it appears that in <hi>Metals</hi> there are four Elements natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and that they are homogeneal. In <hi>pag.</hi> 5. he says, That in the Operation of this Science, we stand in need of more things than Nature doth, and that in those we want, are also four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and so our Principles are alike to those of Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 8. That there are four Kinds or Species, and not more or less, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to compound the White Elixir; <hi>viz. Argentum vivum, Sulphur citrinum fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giens, Sulphur viride fixum habens ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trem nigrum intellectu quamvis clarum in visu videatur, &amp; Sulphur album fixum, &amp;c.</hi> and that they are not of great price.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:47418:70"/>
                  <hi>Pag,</hi> 9. That the <hi>Argentum vivum</hi> being compounded <hi>cum sulphuro vivo ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trino,</hi> become one Mass, which they call <hi>Terra rubea;</hi> and in this respect there needs not any more than three Species or Kinds in the Art: That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this <hi>Terra rubea</hi> is found to be sold ready compounded; therefore he cares not to labour about its Composition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the other two Kinds are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, until they are put into the Work of this Art, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to practice, but very subtlely and hard to be understood.</p>

joyns the Sun and Moon, the perfect Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Gold and Silver, for the Work; so doth <hi>Ripley,</hi> and so all Philosophers; by which, says he, it's evident that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the perfect Metals, or Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with our <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> will compleat the Wotk, as <hi>Arnold</hi> expresly saith in his Questions and Answers to <hi>Boniface;</hi> and <hi>Jodocus Greverus,</hi> in his Treatise, confirms the same in these words:</p>
               <p>☞ If so be (saith he) thou be so poor that thou canst not take Gold, than take so much Silver; yet Gold is the better, as being nearer of Kin to our Water and Mercury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the same thing in his <hi>Introitus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertus</hi> in several places.</p>
               <p>This is chiefly meant by common Luna; that he who can prepare the Mercury aright, tho' he know not how to digest it into Silver and Gold, may notwithstanding with common Silver or Gold, seperately, or with a composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of both, perfect the Great Work. But yet it belongs to the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and tedious way, for which there is little Encouragement; therefore 'tis not Wisdom to depart from our rare and easie Way.</p>

This is the sum of his Discovery.</p>

               <p>In his <hi>Introitus,</hi> pag. 2: he speaks to this purpose, I could cite all the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers concerning this matter; but I want not Witnesses, because I my self am an Adeptist, and write more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than any hath hitherto done: Let him believe me that will, disprove me

that can; and let him carp who list, he shall certainly, for his reward, gain a high Ignorance. I confess the subtil Wits dream of many Chimaeras; but he that is diligent shall find the Truth in the simple way of Nature.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Sendivogius</hi> in his Twelfth Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, saith to this effect; If any Man doubt of the Truth of the Art, let him read the Voluminous Writings of the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> verified by Reason and Experience, whom we may deservedly give Credit to in their own Art: But if any will not give Credit to them, then we know not how to dispute with 'em, as denying <hi>Principles;</hi> for deaf and dumb Men cannot speak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (and it may be added) neither can blind Men judge of <hi>Colours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in his Epilogue or Conclusion, he cries out, O holy and wonderful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who doest not suffer the Sons of Wisdom to err! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Moreover in these Twelve Treatises I have produced so many natural Reasons, that he which is desirous of the Art, and fears God, may the more easily understand all things, which through God's Blessing, with my Eyes I have seen, with my own Hands have made without any Deceipt of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistication.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:47418:97"/>
And elsewhere, he says, we could cite the <hi>Writings</hi> of <hi>Philosophers</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what we have said; but because we have wrote clearer things than are in their <hi>Writings,</hi> they need not any Confirmation; he shall understand who looks into other <hi>Mens Writings,</hi> &amp;c. Know also for certain, that this Art is not placed in Fortune, or casual Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in real Science; and that there is but this one matter in the World, by which, and of which the <hi>Philosophers Stone</hi> is made, <hi>&amp;c:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Elsewhere, he says, It was not my purpose; for some Reasons before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Preface to publish this Book, but a desire to deserve well of those who are Studiously given to libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and philosophical Arts, prevailed with me that I might hold forth to them, that I bear an honest Mind; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that I might declare my self to them that understand the Art, to be their equal Fellow, and to have attain'd their Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>Aeyrenaeus</hi> avers, that at the time of his writing, he had that great and wonderful Medicine in his Possession, and before his Eyes. And in his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Sir <hi>George Ripley</hi>'s Vision, <hi>p.</hi> 24.

he says, I have been a true Witness of Nature unto thee, and I know that I write true; and all Sons of Art shall by my Writings know that I am a Fellow-Heir with them of this Divine Skill. To the Ignorant, says he, I have written so plain as may be; and more I had written, if the Creator of all Things had given me larger Commission, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Also in his <hi>Introitus,</hi> page 33. <hi>Ego Sanè non exdono, (Nisi Dei mei) non furto illum possideo, habeo, feci, et quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die meâ sub ditione servo, &amp;c.</hi> Page 34. <hi>Et scio quae scribo et novit cordium Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator Deus, quod Scribam vera, nec est quod invidiae me accuses, quoniam inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito Calamo, inaudito Stylo, in honorem Dei, usum, fructum proximi, mundique et divitiarum contemptum scribo.</hi>

it; he says in brief, Dissolve Gold in a Water of its own kind, I care not how, but best with his beloved for ease in in working.</p>
               <p>It also appears, That in late times there have been many Adeptists, who knew, and practised this Art, though formerly it was very rare to hear of one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Norton,</hi> in his <hi>Ordinal,</hi> page 52. tells us, That once three Masters of this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence lay in one Bed near to <hi>Leaden-hall</hi> (which he says was a wonderful Thing, whilst it is hard to find one in millions of Men). One of them, he says, was of the Dukedom of <hi>Lorain;</hi> the other two, it seems, were <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sendivog.</hi> in his Epilogue, hath these words; I doubt not but many Men of good Consciences and Affections, do enjoy this Gift of God secretly.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Aeyrenaeus,</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>Introitus,</hi> says that he knew many, who together with himself, enjoyed this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and was perswaded that there would be many more, with whom he should, in a short time, have daily fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity.</p>
               <p>And towards the end of this thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter, he says, he knew very


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47418:98"/>
many who possessed the Art, and the true knowledge of it, who (as it were) had Vowed a most secret Silence, and that he writ his Book without the knowledge of any one of those he dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conversed with: And in so doing he hoped he had improved his Talent well. He further adds, That he foresaw some Hundreds would happily be enlightned by his Writing; therefore he consulted not with Flesh and Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also in the same Chapter he breaks out in these words; <hi>Novi, novi, quod haec mea scripta erunt plurimis instar au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri obryzi et aurum Argentumque per haec mea scripta vilescent instar fimi, credite Juvenes Tyrones, credite Patres, quia tempus adest ad fores, non ex vano con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptu haec scribo, at in spiritu video, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Joannes Langius,</hi> in his Preface before this Book, says to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, if those things which <hi>Mary Rant</hi> (an English Woman) by inward Revelation promised con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the making of Gold, (that it would become Vulgar or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the Year 1661) come to pass and hundred Years after;


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47418:99"/>
then I doubt not at all but it hath taken some beginning from this.</p>
               <p>Neither did these famous and honest minded Philosophers conceal themselves, or the Art out of Envy or Pride; but for fear of evil disposed Persons, who continually sought to do them Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aeyrenaeus,</hi> in his fourteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, says we have professed, and do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain profess, that it is not for the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit we give to other mens Writings that we have published this; we have seen and known (adds he) those things which we faithfully declare; we have made do, see, and possess the Stone, the great Elixir; nor truly do we envy thee the knowledge of it, but wish thou maist learn it from our Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, in his thirteenth Chapter, he says, I dare affirm that I do possess more Riches, than the whole known World is worth; but cannot make use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, because of the Snares of Knaves: Also, in his last Chapter, he says, An Adeptist may so increase the Stone at his Pleasure, both in Weight and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; so that if a Man would, one Man


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47418:99"/>
that is an Adeptist, might transmute into perfect Gold and Silver all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Metals that are in the whole World.</p>
               <p>But for a further warning of these Dangers and Snares he speaks of, let us examine his thirteenth Chapter a little closer.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of it he tells us, he hath delivered many Secrets, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were barren enough to the World; because almost all Chymical Books do abound either with obscure <hi>Aenigmas,</hi> or sophistical <hi>Operations,</hi> or with a heap of pitiful contagious <hi>Words;</hi> but that he hath not so done, resig<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning his Will in this thing to the Divine Pleasure, who (says he) in this last period of the World seems to me to be about the opening of these Treasures: Therefore I do not fear that the Art will be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteemed; far be it from me, this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be; for true Wisdom will defend it self in eternal Honour. I could wish, says he, that Gold and Silver, would at length be of as mean in esteem as Dirt; that great Idol, hitherto adored by the whole World: Then we who know these things, should not so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to hide our selves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:47418:100"/>
From this he goes on to make a piteous Complaint, because of the Dangers and Perils that attend these <hi>Artists,</hi> through the Wickedness of evil Men, and that there is scarce an honest Man to be found; that himself was forced to fly by Night, to shave his Head, and alter his Name; and all this because he (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done some wonderful Cures by means of the grand Elixir) was laid in wait for by wicked Men, meerly for suspicion only, accompanied with a most greedy thirst after Gold.</p>
               <p>Then he proceeds further to shew the Difficulties that <hi>Adeptists</hi> meet with, and says, He hath known some to have been strangled, through the Suspicion only of Desperate Men, that these o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew the Art, tho' they were meer strangers to it: That some will Tattle of their Counterfeiting Money, others can easily know this Gold and Silver from common, because 'tis Finer than any other, and that a Man runs the hazard of his Head by Allaying or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterating it, because of the strict Laws of all Nations, who have provided, That every Deterioration of Gold and Silver (altho' according to Standard) yet if it be not done by a Professed and


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47418:100"/>
Licensed <hi>Metalourgist,</hi> shall be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Capital Crime. Then he shews how he and others were forced to leave and lose 600 <hi>l.</hi> value of Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and concludes in these words, We being taught by these Dangers, have determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to lye hid, and will communicate the Art to thee, who dreamest of such things [that is who think'st these sorts of fears and dangers ridiculous, and that if thou knew'st these things thou wouldst do otherwise] that so we may see what Publick Good thou wilt do when adepted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then he proceeds to shew and explain the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the Art, and adds; Versly, as for my self, I do not possess the Stone by Theft, but by the Gift of my God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards, he tells us, That <hi>Elias</hi> the Artist is already born, and now glorious Things are declared of the City of God; from which he again falls into his Complaints against evil minded Men, and professes his aversion to Avarice, in these words.—I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, I loath, and deservedly detest this idolizing of Gold and Silver, by which the World celebrates her Price, Pomp and Vanities: Ah, filthy Evil! Ah, vain Nothingness! Believe ye that I conceal


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47418:101"/>
these things out of Envy? No, verily; for I profess I grieve from my Heart, that we are driven, as it were, like <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds</hi> from the Face of the Lord throughout the whole Earth. But what needs many words, that thing that we have seen, taught and handled, which we have, possess and know, these we do declare, being moved with meer Compassion towards the Studious, and with indignation of Gold and Silver, and of precious Stones, not as they are Creatures of God, far be it from us; for in that respect we Honour them, and think them worthy Esteem: But the People of <hi>Israel</hi> adores them, as well as the <hi>World;</hi> therefore let it be ground to Powder like the <hi>Brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he shews his Hopes and Expectations of this Art, and why; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the value of his <hi>Writings;</hi> then he seems to prophesie concerning the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State of the <hi>Adepts,</hi> and shews his Zeal for the good of <hi>Israel.</hi> These things, says he, I send before in the World, like a Preacher, that I may not be buried unprofitably in the World; and draws to a conclusion, in these words, <hi>pag.</hi> 35. <hi>Esto Liber meus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursor</hi>


                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:47418:101"/>
                  <hi>Eliae qui paret viam Domini re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giam, et utinam quilibet in toto terrarum orbe ingeniosus artem hanc calleret, tum copiosissimè abundante auro, argento, gem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis<expan>

               </p>
               <p>Thus we have heard some of those great Troubles, with which this honest Hearted <hi>Adeptist</hi> was surrounded; and which (believe me) are sufficient to deter any serious Man from appearing publick in this Matter, did things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main now in the same posture in which he left them; but to our great Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the Scene is alter'd, the Palace Gates are laid open, and those that were heretofore shut out, are once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain admitted to kiss the Royal Hand of their Prince.</p>
               <p>But if any one should suppose that this hard usage only happened to the <hi>Adepts,</hi> in this our Masters time, (tho' it's probable he is still living) let him hear what the Noble <hi>Sendivogius</hi> has to say on this Subject: In the Epilogue of his Twelve Treatises, he hath words, to this purpose; I doubt not (says he) but many Men of good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47418:102"/>
and Affections do enjoy this Gift of God secretly. These being warn'd by my Example, and Dangers are made more Cautious and Wise, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that commendable Silence of <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates:</hi> For as often as I would disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my self to great Men, it always turned to my Loss and Danger.</p>
               <p>Also, after he has for the sake of the <hi>Ingenuous</hi> largely described the nature of the four Elements, and their Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he descends unto the three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Things; in which Treatise <hi>Lat.</hi> pag. 166. <hi>Engl.</hi> 120. he says, <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivè dicimus, &amp;c.</hi> To conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we say, That this Art is the Gift of God alone; which being known he must also be pray'd to, that he would give his Blessing to the Art; for without this Divine Blessing it would be of no use, and unprofitable, which we our selves have had Experience of, seeing we have, by reason of this Art, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone great Danger; yea we have had more Mischief and Misfortune by it, than Advantage; but there is a time when Men are wise too late.</p>
               <p>Then he proceeds to shew how he was protected by Divine Providence in his Misfortunes, and how shamefully


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47418:102"/>
his Enemies perished: For I have heard (says he) that my Enemies have fallen into that Snare which they laid for me, they who would have taken away my Life, have lost their own; and some of them which would have taken away my Goods, have lost Kingdoms. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I know many that would have detracted from my good Name, have perished with Disgrace; so great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation have I always had from the great Creator of all things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the end of his <hi>Philosophical Riddle;</hi> Believe me (says he) if I were not a Man of that Rank and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as I am, nothing would be more pleasant to me than a solitary Life, or with <hi>Diogenes</hi> to lye hid under a Tub; for I see all things that are, to be but Vanity, and that Deceit and Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness are altogether in use, where all things are to be sold, and that Vice doth excel Vertue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the Preface to his Treatise of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> he also seems to foretel that the dawning of the happy Day of the <hi>Adepts</hi> was at hand. <hi>Pag.</hi> 112. <hi>Lat.</hi> 78. <hi>Engl.</hi> He tells us those times are now past, when Fidelity amongst Friends flourished, and this Art was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated

and brought him before King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;</hi> hereupon <hi>Deluis</hi> swore that <hi>Daulton,</hi> in a little space, had made him a thousand Pound of as good Gold as the Royal was. <hi>Daulton</hi> told <hi>Deluis</hi> he was Forsworn. <hi>Deluis</hi> Answered, not in what he had then said, tho' he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taken an Oath to <hi>Daulton</hi> not to discover him, which Oath he might break for the Weal of the King and his Land. <hi>Daulton</hi> Reply'd, that avoided not his Perjury: However he soberly told the King, that by reason of having the <hi>Medicine,</hi> he often had been brought into great Troubles; and to avoid it for the future, he cast it into a foul and common Lake in the Abby where he was taken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The King would have him to make it again. <hi>Daulton</hi> said it could not be; for it was given him by a Canon of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> whose Work he had attended many Years. The King being sorry for the Loss, gives <hi>Daulton</hi> four <hi>Marks,</hi> and his Liberty; but <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> deceitfully lay in wait for him, and brought him to <hi>Stepney,</hi> and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants took away the Money.

There may be others far more able, though not so willing to lay open this <hi>Mystery;</hi> for in this I am free, having not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged either my Hand or Heart to Secrecy; yet all things must be taken with a Grain of Salt.

to attain them? And in some that are a little more ingenuous, How fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are considerable Sums of <hi>Money</hi> bestowed to boot; yet in this noble <hi>Art,</hi> so far excelling all humane Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as the Sun doth a Candle, who will imploy himself with Diligence? Unless it be some <hi>Money</hi> minded Sots, who seek only for Riches, And yet how soon are even they weary?

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47418:107"/>
Books and Rules before mentioned, and tho' I did it by ghuess only, and not by weight or measure, yet in a weeks time I both Joyn'd them, and Purg'd, Distill'd and Sublimed my <hi>Mercury,</hi> so that it answer'd as much as I could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably expect: But I digested it not, for I had no <hi>Athanor</hi> or true digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Furnace: Besides I am allotted to serve others, and in Publishing this, I hope I shall serve and satisfy all Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men, after which I may endeavour to serve my self; yet remembring that tho' many are called, a few only may be chosen: He that shall attain this gift, will take care enough to keep it Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.

               <p>First, If he should live a thousand years, and every day provide for a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, he could not want, for he may increase his <hi>Stone</hi> at his pleasure, both in Weight and Vertue, so that if a man would, one man that is an <hi>Adep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> might Transmute into perfect Gold and Silver all the imperfect <hi>Metals</hi> that are in the whole World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He may by this Art make Precious Stones and Gems, such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be paralelld in Nature for Goodness and Greatness.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:47418:119"/>
Thirdly, and Lastly, He hath a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine Universal, both for prolonging Life, and curing all Diseases; so that one true <hi>Adeptist</hi> can easily cure all the Sick Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World (I mean this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is sufficient.)</p>
               <p>Now to the King Eternal, Immortal and sole Almighty, be everlasting Praise for his unspeakable Gifts and unvaluable Treasures.</p>
               <p>Whosoever (saith he) enjoyeth this Talent, Let him be sure to employ it to the Glory of God, and the good of his Neighbours, least he be found ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God his Creator, who hath blessed him with so great a Talent, and to be in the last Day found Guilty (of mispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it) and so be Condemned.</p>
