         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe the ſcandalous reports of certaine factious hot-brained Perſons in the Citty of Exeter, have imputed Gods viſitation of our ſinnes upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my late at <hi>Stratton,</hi> to treachery of mine: I ſhall beg ſo much of your patience, as to enforme your ſelves from this Paper, the true ſtate of that affaire. 'Twas not without exceſſive continued paines, that I had put that Tumultuous body into a ſerviceable poſture in the field, and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to any man of ſo much honeſty and honour, as dares ſpeake truth in the behalfe of a dejected Priſoner, whether I was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes buſied in the heat of the Skirmiſh where ever it hapned to be, from the very beginning till I was totally forſaken, both by the Officers and Souldiers, except thoſe that dyed by me, and the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell loſt ſome teſtimony, wherein was my Cane broken in my hand by a ſhot, my Horſe ſhot under me, and at laſt a hurt in my head, whereby I loſt ſome blood. Thus (miſerable in all appearance) being abſolutely deſtitute of any thing, but the protection of my God which never yet failed me, I charged ſingle through a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Musketiers, till I came up cloſe to the Officer that led them, who I took for Sir <hi>Bevill Grenvile,</hi> for his back parts were very like him, and inſtead of uſing my Armes to take his life, which was then very much in my power, (though not without a certaine loſſe of mine owne, for all the Souldiers preſently upon the ſtop encloſed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40855:3"/>
me round,) I yeelded my ſelfe into his hands, and I found him a moſt gallant Gentleman, for when I had delivered my Sword, he received many blowes to beare them off from me, and ſuppreſſed the rage of the Souldiers towards me, with the hazard of his owne life, his name is Lewis Tremaine, Enſigne to Sir <hi>Bevill Grenvile,</hi> to whom, being cloſe at hand with a ſtand of Pikes, he led me, and I ſhall ever acknowledge as long as I breath in ſpite of the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of theſe factious Spirits in <hi>Exeter,</hi> or ſuch as they have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by their Hypocriſie in other parts of this County, that I received ſo much humanity and noble favour from Sir <hi>Bevill Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> and the reſt of the Commanders of the <hi>Corniſh</hi> Army, as made that a greater griefe to me to have been an Enemy to ſo much gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry and vertue, then that now I was a Priſoner; nevertheleſſe the ſad eſtate which I conceived my Countrymen to be in, from whom it had pleaſed God, for reaſons above my reach, thus to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his favour, wounded yet deeper my bleeding heart, &amp; ſo much the more, becauſe I reſented heavily the Juſtice of the Cauſe, which we had laboured to Support, being as I conceived, the Iuſt Rights of our gratious King and his Subjects, limited by the Lawes and the Purity of the true Proteſtant Religion, which the high Court of Parliament had inſtructed us, theſe Gentlemen whoſe hands I was thus fallen into, had endeavoured to corrupt, and I was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſenſible, that thoſe morall vertues which I ſaw they were endowed with, in ſo eminent a degree, might be companions for ought I knew (though hardly credible) of deceitfull hearts; and that the Iuſtee of the Quarrell on either ſide is not alwayes demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the chance of Warre, thus releeving my perplexity with ſadneſſe, and reſolving to ſpend my dayes in griefe, till it ſhould pleaſe God to put an end to the miſerable Diſtractions of this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Kingdome, I was viſited by ſome of the moſt eminent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Army, with whom I fell into diſcourſe of theſe very points; wherein all of us agreed upon the neceſſity of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Law in the priviledge that it gives this Nation in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as well as in the Iuſt Prerogative which it allowes His Royall Majeſty, without which this Kingdom is neceſſarily ſubject to Arbitrary Government, &amp; the Rights both of the King &amp; People are vaniſht into an Aerie title. But 'twas not long till we came to this concluſion, That as evill Counſells had heretofore been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40855:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the prejudice of the Common-wealth, ſo the ſatisfaction given by His Majeſty was exceeding great and beyond the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of all moderate men; That the objections againſt His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Counſell of continuall endeavours at preſent to force the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament by Armes, are cleerly anſwered by His Majeſties many Proteſtations, and for the fulfilling of thoſe Proteſtations to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the differences of the Kingdom, His Majeſty will not ſtick to give any aſſurance that ſhall be thought reaſonable; and likewiſe all the Commanders of this Army are content to put it under their hands, and to take a ſolemne oath as punctuall and as ſtrong as can be invented, that when ſoever His Majeſty ſhall be drawne by any Counſell or meanes whatſoever, to neglect thoſe Proteſtations, that then they will totally deſert the Service they are engaged in, and for the preſent they will be content to uſe the whole power, which His Majeſty hath inveſted them with, to give a free pardon to all ſuch in theſe Weſterne Counties as will lay downe Armes, and be content to be governed by the knowne Lawes ſetled by Act of Parliament; &amp; what aſſurance ſoever ſhall be demanded on His Majeſties behalfe for the ſetling of a Religious, Honourable, and a firme Peace they are ready to give. Now whether this Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation towards the Peace and Juſtice of this Kingdome hath poſſeſt theſe Gentlemen from the beginning of the Warre, or whether by the continued diſpute of the difference by which the Kingdome is divided, the matter is now ſo anotomiſed? as that the quinteſſence of truth extract from partiality to either ſide, is eminently perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, or elſe whether the blood ſhed betwixt theſe two Counties by miſunderſtandings one of another, which cannot but move all Chriſtian hearts to a Compaſſionate beſeeching of the Almighty God to ſheath his ſword, hath had ſtronger operation upon the hearts and Conſciences of theſe noble Gentlemen, then the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Exeter</hi> are likely to admit of on their part, is not in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion materiall to ſtand in debate of, only I conceive my ſelfe bound in Conſcience for truths ſake, to aſſure all honeſt well meaning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians upon the hopes that I have of ſalvation, and upon the faith and honour of a Gentleman and a Souldier, that I never ſaw an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my freer from vice, nor more religiouſly inclined, then I perceive the whole Genious of this Army to be, nor did I ever ſee more heartily cleere and earneſt expreſſions of affection to a religious and a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40855:4"/>
juſt Peace then the Commanders of this Army are full off: more then which, (with ſo ingenious offers of the meanes to conclude that) cannot poſſibly be expected from humane fleſh, and though it hath been accounted Treaſon in the opinion of the factious Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of the Citty of <hi>Exeter,</hi> whoſe intereſt hath ever ſhewed it ſelfe againſt any Peace but an abſolute Conqueſt, and an utter extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of thoſe that unconvict, they doe but once thinke ungodly, that I ſhould repreſent my knowledge of the ſtate of this matter to thoſe Deputy-Lievtenants that I conceived in all reſpects fitteſt to judge of that, and to recommend it to the whole County, yet my duty to God and to my Country, will not give me leave to obſcure ſo faire a meanes of the happineſſe of this Kingdom for any ſcandall whatſoever, or to prove my ſelfe in the face of Heaven ſo coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Chriſtian, as to comply with damnable hypocriſie againſt ſo cleer a truth: who knowes not that nothing will be ſo certaine and neceſſary a deſtruction to the Country as to continue it the ſeate of Warre, and what moderate man is there, that cannot ſee that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World could have extorted from this Army in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Condition, that it now is, ſuch a gallant offer of a Religious, honourable, and a firme Peace, but their owne Nobleneſſe and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of heart towards truth, and the reall welfare of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. Let us not involve our ſelves with the obſtinacy of a few opinionated men, whiles 'tis apparenr as the caſe ſtands, how that their Cauſe is accompanied with nothing of Religion, but it's abuſed name, what Religion is there now in <hi>Cornwall</hi> but the ſame that we profeſſe, or what bondage is there to thoſe that doe not wilfully thruſt themſelves into it? Let us but deferre the cutting of one anothers throats, till novelties in Law and in Religion begin to ſhew themſelves. We are then as capable to dye for the defence of truth, as now for the ſuſpition, the power of the ſword being ſtill entruſted in our hands. Many a well meaning Chriſtian takes a by path to Heaven, and knowes not that he wanders, but, Oh, the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable unhappines of thoſe that refuſe to be led into the way, I know it concernes the intereſt of thoſe that have ſet themſelves againſt Peace, with ſuch as they are pleas'd to call the wicked, how undeſervedly ſoever, to raiſe ſcandalls upon me, and I am well informed that the report of my betraying the Army at <hi>Stratton,</hi> was invented after the view of my Letters to my Father, with Sir
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40855:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Iohn Bamfield,</hi> and Sir <hi>Nicholas Martin</hi> to accommodate the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of theſe Counties, for which the Cittizens of <hi>Exeter</hi> have beyond all example Committed the Herauld that was employed, upon the falſe pretence of eating Scroales of paper, and have caſt a jealouſy upon ſome of thoſe Gentlemen that hitherto have been thought by all the World farre more worthy then ſuch Creatures as themſelves are, to ſteere the affaires of the Commonwealth in theſe parts, but as I never avoyded danger to ſerve my Countrey when I lead them in the field, ſo I will now preſſe through all difficulties in ſpite of oppoſition to mediate, and by all honeſt means to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute its Peace, and ſuch as ſhall appeare to unite in my opinion, I am ready to lead or to follow, or to Comrade with, to reduce this obſtinate handfull in the Citty of <hi>Exeter,</hi> that are the only means to deny their Country its Capacity of ſo great a bleſſing; and herein I am reſolved to boaſt the loyalty which I owe His Majeſty as well as my dear affection to you that have thus farre intruſted me with your lives, and for my behaviour at <hi>Stratton</hi> I refuſe no mans teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, of thoſe that durſt put themſelves ſo farre into danger as to be eye witneſſes, but for my Lord of <hi>Stamford,</hi> and ſuch others as ranne away, whoſe Treaſon really it was, I know that concerns their intereſt to ſecond this accuſation upon mee, having no other way to extenuate their intolerable Cowardice, but becauſe they are People that I am never likely to meet with in the field, I leave them to the Scourge of their own Conſcience, and to paſſe the time in making Aldermen, and women believe them valiant, whiles all the world beſides knows the contrary. And now I challenge Malice it ſelfe to accuſe me in all this, of the leaſt Circumſtance of untruth or fallacy, ſo I beſeech God to diſpoſe you to accept of ſuch a Peace, as for ought I know will ſhortly be denied you upon your knees, And that the groanes of this bleeding Country may not riſe up in judgement againſt the Barbariſme of thoſe, that by impriſoning the meſſenger of Peace, have endeavoured to deſtroy the Balſome that ſhould cure the wounds, which for ought I ſee themſelves have made.</p>
