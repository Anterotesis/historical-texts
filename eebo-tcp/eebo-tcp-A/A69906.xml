         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Royall preſence
and the traine of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Malignant Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was lately among you,
when Courtly, curious,
and cunningly penned
Language was written, and uttered in
your hearing, when you ſaw ſo many of
the Gentry of this County your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and Land-lords flock to <hi>Yorke,</hi> and
adhere to, and aſſiſt the conſpirators and
contrivers of that oppoſition and force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> which
ſince hath broken forth, and been manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
to all the Kingdome. It is no great
wonder though the Common ſort were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57838:3"/>
deceived and came up in ſuch flockes to
<hi>Heworth-Moore</hi> to doe ſervice to the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Idoll. But do but look a few years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
that, and you may ſee ſeverall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
upon the Subject by all manner
of Monopolies and Extortions of money;
Lawes trodden under foot, Juſtice ſet to
ſale in every Court, from the higheſt
Bench in <hi>Weſtminſter-hall,</hi> to the Seſſions
and Commiſſion of Sowers in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
The purity of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ſtained with Popiſh, Arminian, and
other new invented Doctrines, and that
by Authority, and out of Pulpits; and the
true Worſhip of God turned into apiſh
and popiſh inventions of men: Popery
grew faſt and received favour, and the
true Proteſtant Miniſters ſuppreſſed and
diſgraced. And Parliaments (which were
the proper and onely remedy to help all
this, and the reſt of the diſeaſes in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke
body) not onely abandoned, but by
Proclamation declared a high crime, for
any one to ſay there ſhould be a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57838:3"/>
called, and there was none in foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
yeares; in which time the diſtempers
of the Kingdom by ſuch miſguidance grew
ſo deadly, eſpecially by the Scotiſh Army
raiſed in defence of that Nation, and
brought into this to prevent inroades in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their owne, by the forces raiſed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation
of the Prelaticall party, that in
the end this Soveraigne Parliament was
ſummoned by due courſe of Law, and ſo
eſtabliſhed as never Parliament was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by the higheſt confirmation this
Kingdome can give, and not to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
againſt their wills, unleſſe by the
ſword of Traytors. When this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had ſitten a while, and had beene
courted by granting ſeverall convenient
Lawes to ſweeten the bitterneſſe was paſt:
This bridle of Tyranny and ſoveraigne
purge of the Common-wealth, &amp; Churches
Maladies, could no longer be indured, by
the Prelaticall and Malignant party, and
that which no Jeſuiticall craft could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve,
is reſolved upon, the Sword muſt,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57838:4"/>
and after many bitter reviling words from
<hi>York</hi> in Declarations and Anſwers againſt
the Parliament, (of which the Law ſayes,
<hi>No man ought to thinke diſhonourably</hi>) With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this unhappy County, (and by it)
which will be an infamy to the Actors for
ever, notwithſtanding all the applawces
for it by the Court, as they had many;
the firſt allowed Arms were taken up, and
the Commands of Parliament diſobeyed,
and their Meſſengers and Officers with
Scorne abuſed, and the Judgement of that
moſt Honourable Court which is the eye
and reaſon of the Common-wealth in the
queſtion of the <hi>Militia</hi> contemned, and
the opinions of private men admired and
advanced, which the Lawes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
never appointed, nor is of any value.
When the King by the aſſiſtance of the
Malignant Gentry of this County whoſe
names are hereafter mentioned, had in
order to theſe opinions of flattering aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Lawyers about the Throne, of which
it never wanted, more (then a good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57838:4"/>
had ſeiſed upon the <hi>Militia</hi> of this
County, the King with ſome of that
<hi>Militia</hi> departs into the other neighbour
Counties to doe the like, and by the ſame
Gentry the firſt Illegall and unjuſt Aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of eight thouſand pound is put upon
the Countrey to maintaine ſome part of
that <hi>Militia</hi> left behind, to ſuppreſſe the
Lawes, and the reſt of the Gentry, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
the Judgement and Direction of
the Parliament; but this was oppoſed as a
thing againſt Law, ſo much bragged on,
ſhould be the ſquare of Government, and
an oppreſſion which made but way for a
greater, as in ſhort time it proved, riſing
from 8000. to 30000 l. by month, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
to 80. thouſand l. <hi>per menſem.</hi>
When theſe Gentlemens unlawfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
aſſembled at <hi>Yorke</hi> could not defend
ſuch their unjuſt proceedings, nor their
perſons from the Juſtice of the Parliament,
nor the forces raiſed to ſuppreſs theſe treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
and trayterous acts againſt the State
and Law, they conſpire to call into the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57838:5"/>
County the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
cenſure of Parliament for High-trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and a Semi-papian and an Athiſticall
perſon, as was more declared afterward
by that horrid crew he brought in with
him, and they preſſe him by arguments
of Service to the King and his own Honour
to come to their aſſiſtance, which was
in truth to protect themſelves againſt the
Juſtice of the Parliament. <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
the motion, upon termes of horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
oppreſſion to the Countrey, and to
ſerve the Queene. And theſe oppreſſours
of their Countrey agree to all, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to that Propoſition about the
Queene, and promiſe any further contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
to that good ſervice. And by a
ſecond Letter, magnifie the Earle of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi>
for his entertaining the invitation,
and make vows of honour and obedience
to his Lordſhip, and tell of their diſtreſſes
for Loyalty to the King, when they are
about traiterouſly to deſtroy both the
Law, and the Parliament, the fountain and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57838:5"/>
bulwarke both of Law and Juſtice, and
conſequently the Kingdome, and ſo to
make him a King of bruites and not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
men. This Lord thus courted, checks
at one Article, omitted, which was the
maine one to inrich his Popiſh Tyrannical
Officers and Minions with a full pay; and
if that be granted, then his little Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is in a huge diſpoſition to be really
the faithfull Servant of theſe complotters
and enemies to the State, as he afterwards
proved, being the Leader, (<hi>Judas</hi> like) to
theſe betrayers of Chriſt and his Cauſe,
but are ſince fallen backward to the
ground as that Band of men did. At the
Rendition of <hi>Pomfret</hi> Caſtle there was
found the Originall Letters by which this
bargaine was made with the Earle of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi>
by the Conſpiratours to ſell their
Countrey, and all that was of worth in it
to that Popiſh Commander and Army:
which Letters being ſhewed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitees
for that County attending at <hi>York,</hi>
and by them duely conſidered of, it was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57838:6"/>
agreed and thought fit that thoſe Letters
ſhould be Printed, and a Declaration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, that poſterity might ſee who had
been the chief deſtroyers of their Country.</p>
            <p>The Letters are theſe being examined by
ſome of the Committee appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and the Originalls remaine in ſafe hands
to be ſeene by any man that ſhall deſire it.</p>

Captaine <hi>Hothams</hi> coming to Doncaſter,
which was by command of the Parliament
of <hi>England</hi> to aſſiſt the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> to ſet
up the <hi>Militia,</hi> (an infeſting the Country)
They invite Athiſts, Papiſts, and who ever

to enable them to oppoſe the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Parliament, and call it great

to the Pope then the King. That Lord ſo
invited, yeelds preſently to that bait they
call Honour, but inthralls them with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
to oppreſſe the Country by Aſſeſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

<hi>Bradford,</hi> much of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and numbers of

which was but a ſconce for their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection

he had all things but one granted him,
by their Articles, (which was his Officers
