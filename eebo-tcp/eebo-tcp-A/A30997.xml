            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Church of Chriſt, here below, is juſtly ſtiled the Church Militant, not onely in diſtinction to that which is Triumphant above; but likewiſe upon the ſcore of thoſe many enemies, which ſhe encounters in the world: and conſequently every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſame, at his firſt entrance into it, his initiation into Chriſtianity, doth ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denounce war againſt the Pomps, and Vanities of this wicked world; Our life is termed a continual Warfare; Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Captain of our Salvation; his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles acquaint us, how much they ſuffered becauſe they would not deny the Faith; nor turn Renegadoes from Him: particularly,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53974:3"/>
His ſtout Champion Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> gives in a large account, of the ſeveral Conflicts, which he had with the world; And how he came off more than Conquerour through Chriſt that ſtrengthned him: when he was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuffering Martyrdom at <hi>Rome,</hi> he made it his pious boaſt, that <hi>he had fought the good fight,</hi> that <hi>he had kept the Faith</hi>; And when he would render his Chriſtian impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, againſt the aſſaults of the world, he commands him to <hi>put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> (otherguiſe weapons then thoſe which either <hi>Homer</hi> armed <hi>Achilles</hi> with, or <hi>Virgil</hi> his <hi>Aeneas</hi>) But above all he bids him take the <hi>ſhield of Faith,</hi> wherewith he boldly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures him, that he ſhould be able to quench <hi>all the fiery Darts of the wicked.</hi> For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot do greater right to the Text, then if I ſhould awhile inſiſt upon, and recount to you the ſeveral Trophies, and noble At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements of Faith: How that not onely the Authour, and Finiſher of it, for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53974:3"/>
deſpiſing the ſhame, and was therefore ſet down at the right hand of the Throne of God; But moreover how its firſt embracers obtained a good report, as well by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſufferings, as the ſtrangeneſs of their conqueſts. Their ſufferings were as great, as either wit, or malice could make them; And yet their courage was far greater, for they did not onely triumph over their moſt exquiſite torments, but oftentimes conquered their moſt obdurate tormentours.</p>
            <p>As for their conqueſts; they were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by no humane force; they uſed no open Hoſtility; the ſtratagems of war, were as much againſt their ſimplicity, as upon this ſcore, they were contrary to the expreſs words of their betrayed Maſter. <hi>Peter put up thy ſword, it is enough.</hi> There was but one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle blow given, and that, too, upon the juſteſt occaſion that ever preſented it ſelf in the world; For it was to reſcue the very Lord of Life, out of the hands of that miſcreant, who betrayed Him to Death: And yet he that gave it received a ſevere
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53974:4"/>
check for his pains. <hi>They that take the ſword ſhall periſh by the ſword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let <hi>Mahomet</hi> propagate his ſenceleſs Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran by force of Arms; let him by the ſame power, he tyranniz'd over the bodies of his vaſſals, captivate their ſouls; and ſo at once betray both to utter ruine. Let <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks</hi> dictate the whimſies of a cras'd Brain, thoſe ſlaviſh Doctrines, which are but the neceſſary reſult of a moroſe temper, for the immediate Oracles of God, the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Gifts, and Graces of his free and Princely Spirit. And if they be not preſently received; let them betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to open violence; commit the moſt horrid Outrages upon their fellow creatures; as they have done in ſeveral parts of the world, when once they got the ſword into their hands. But the Goſpel of Peace knows no ſuch boyſterous methods. Chriſts Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, for the Propagation of his Doctrines, never drew any ſword, but that of the Spirit. They uſed none of thoſe cruel Engines, by which the Chieftains of the world carried on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53974:4"/>
their bloudy Conqueſts. Their weapons were ſpiritual. The Victories which they aim'd at were over mens minds. They had no defence but the <hi>Breaſt-plate of Faith</hi>: And yet they fought not <hi>againſt fleſh and bloud</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but againſt <hi>Principalities,</hi> againſt <hi>Powers,</hi> againſt <hi>the Rulers of the darkneſs of this world,</hi> againſt <hi>Spiritual wickedneſs in high places.</hi> And as they fought againſt them, ſo they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them. By their Faith they ſpoiled Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities; deveſted the evil ſpirits of their uſurped power over the minds of men; threw them out of their Temples; ſilenced their Oracles; beat down their images, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſhew of them openly, and triumphing over them. And as the <hi>Romans,</hi> to magnifie their Conqueſts, were wont to lead their captived Enemies in Triumph through their Cities; ſo the Apoſtles, by the might of Chriſt, carried the powers of Hell in open triumph, as thoſe whom they had victoriouſly taken captive. Thus, by the light of Faith, was the Prince of darkneſs vanquiſhed, and all his ſtrong holds caſt down.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:53974:5"/>And as they thus conquered him, ſo did they all thoſe whom he had made Enemies to the Faith. Neither the greatneſs of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Empire on the one ſide, nor the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious practiſes of the Infidel Jews on the other; neither the wit, &amp; crafty wilineſs of the Philoſophers, who decried the Diſciples for ſo many credulous Fops; nor yet the Haran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, which the Oratours made againſt the meaneſt of Chriſts Doctrines, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53974:5"/>
And <hi>the Sect of the Nazarens,</hi> (as <hi>Tertullus</hi> maliciouſly called the Chriſtians) was in a ſhort time more numerous then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sect whatſoever; the Doctrines of Chriſt more univerſally received, then the <hi>Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> the Opinions, of any the moſt renowned Philoſophers. In ſum, the Diſciples, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on the name of the Lord Jeſus, from ſilly, cowardly perſons, became valiant, and wiſe; conquering the ſtrong, confuting the learned; baffling the wits, and overpowring the great ones: The Faith which they had received they valiantly maintained, in ſpite of bonds, and impriſonments; threats, and intreaties; through honours, and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; cruel mockings, and ſcourgings; In a word; In ſpite of all the various, and moſt affrighting ſhapes which Death could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelf in. Thus the Diſciples and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians conquered the world; Thus the Fathers, and Prophets of old obtained a good report; Thus fought the noble Army of Martyrs; And thus, muſt all the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of Chriſtianity behave themſelves, in

their ſeveral combates with the world. For, <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our Faith.</hi>

               <hi>What this Faith is which overcometh the world,</hi> I need not go far to ſeek.

            <p>But becauſe we live in a ſceptical Age; an Age which is apt to ſtrike at the very Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Religion; and, with <hi>Celſus</hi> that Drolling Atheiſt, to object againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that which makes them ſo; their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Though this Objection might very well be retorted upon themſelves; For, who (I pray) are greater Dictatours, then the Oppoſers of Religion? And muſt not their followers be ſtrangely credulous, who embrace the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of fallible men, in oppoſition to the Word of eternal Truth? Yet I ſhall briefly endeavour to ſhew, that Chriſt the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, whom we adore in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of eternal ſalvation, was the true Meſsias.</p>
            <p>Taking then for granted the Divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures, the Writings of the Old and New Teſtament: Though this muſt not be thought a Begging the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſince there are better Arguments to prove them ſo, then can be produced for the truth of <hi>Saluſt, Livy,</hi> or any the moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Hiſtorians: <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Socin. de Aut. ſcript.</note> This granted, 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that immediately upon the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> the Meſsias was promiſed, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head</hi>; and

conſequently raiſe his poſterity to an higher pitch of preferment, than the integrity of his Creation entituled them to.

            <p>Were not all the miracles, which were to be wrought by the Meſsias, fully performed by him? He gave eyes to the blind, ears to the deaf, ſpeech to the dumb, feet to the lame, reſtored the dead to life.

to exceed him, in his eſſential property, of lying, and calumniating.</p>
            <p>Then as for his Offices.

His Kingly Power was conſpicuous in more illuſtrious Inſtances, through the whole Syſtem of the Creation. The Angels were ambitious to miniſter unto him. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils trembled at his word, and fell like lightning before him. The wind and the Sea obeyed him. Hunger and Thirſt, thoſe impatient deſires, waited his leiſure. Sickneſs and Health, Death and the Grave, and Hell it ſelf were forced to acknowledge his Sovereignty.</p>
            <p>As for his Prieſtly Office. The Aaroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part of it he diſpatched by offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſacrifice to his incenſed Father. And

               <hi>the Lusts of the eye, and the Pride of Life</hi>: to which we may add evil Examples, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, and in a word, whatſoever Bait the great Adverſary of Mankind throws in our way, to ſeduce us from our Religion; and conſequently as he diſpoſſeſſed our Firſt Parents of a Terreſtrial, ſo to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our arrival at a Celeſtial Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</p>
            <p>And are theſe the ſtrongeſt Forces, which the World can muſter up, and bring into the Field againſt us? <hi>Impar congreſſus</hi>! The Fleſh againſt the Spirit! The members a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the mind! impotent Earth againſt the Powers of Heaven! all of them in open Rebellion; And may they receive a Doom anſwerable to their Crime.</p>

Luſts and Pride; Things which the common conſent of Mankind, hath branded with a note of Infamy. He that makes his Belly his God, hates to be counted a Glutton. The covetous wretch, though he deteſteth

the virtue, courts the title of a liberal Perſon. He that is moſt addicted to vain-glory, would not be thought ambitious. He that is ſeduced by every little tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thinks he is diſparaged when you count him one of an eaſie facil temper. Can any thing then be more ignoble, than to be led captive by ſuch vices which proclaim their baſeneſs, by diſowning their name? was it not a ſtrange over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in <hi>Eſau,</hi> to ſell his birth-right for a meſs of pottage? A prodigious piece of folly in <hi>Judas,</hi> to betray his Maſter for a few pence? In <hi>Lucifer</hi> to forfeit Heaven, to gratifie his pride? And yet of this rank are all thoſe, who ſurrender their Faith into the power of ſuch mean adverſaries. 'Tis highly againſt the points of Honour, for a Perſon of Quality to enter the field, and engage with a Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. How much more diſhonourable is it, for an high and Heaven-born Soul to be overcome, by the low and baeſe temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the World?</p>

               <hi>do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengthned him</hi>; and if we cannot do ſo too, 'tis not becauſe Chriſt is wanting to us, but we to our ſelves. The fleſh, indeed, may war againſt the Spirit; The members may mutiny againſt the mind: But 'tis at their own peril if they do; for the one is weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy, the other ready and active; and if the members ever prevail, it muſt be through the conſent, degeneracy, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency of the mind. We diſparage our faculties, and diſhonour God who gave them; when we think all the freedom left us, conſiſteth in a liberty to ſin. It were better for us if we had no wills at all, than that they ſhould lye under ſuch a fatal doom. We may, if we pleaſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe that dominion, which is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right of our Supreme Powers. A manifeſt proof whereof is, that there are very few who are totally captivated by ſin.

And they who are, have taken more pains, thus vilely to enſlave themſelves, than they need have been at in aſſerting the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty of the Sons of God. 'Tis far more difficult to conquer the checks of Conſcience, than to keep it void of offence both towards God, and towards man.</p>

Faith propounds to you the joys of Heaven, and aſſures you, that you ſhall be partaker of them, if you continue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto the end. And ſhall the fading riches of this World, be preferred to the immortal treaſures of the other? The tranſient, dull, nauſeous delights of ſenſe, to thoſe vigorous, unallayed pleaſures, which are at Gods right hand for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more? Shall the ambition of being great here, hinder us from being ſo hereafter? Shall the unconſtant blaſt of popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, prevent us of the joyful acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Angels? Shall an earthly be more valuable, than an Heavenly Crown? Shall light afflictions which are but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

make us forfeit an eternal weight of Glory?</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſuch Conſiderations as have hitherto prevailed in the World; and they muſt do ſo ſtill; unleſs we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne the King of Kings; murther the immortality of the Soul; cancel the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable laws of Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Evil; baniſh the reward which belongs to the one, and take away the puniſhment which is due to the other.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the laſt place. That you may neither be overcome by the temptations of the World, nor think the joys of Heaven unattainable; Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to your imitation a whole cloud of witneſſes, of Apoſtles and Prophets, of Martyrs and Confeſſours; who acquitting themſelves valiantly, received a Crown for their recompenſe.</p>
            <p>And as Faith is the means of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the world, ſo is it the victory it

ſelf. For after it hath fought the good fight here below, and reigned till it hath put all its enemies under its feet; then it begins to offer a kind of ſacred violence to the Regions above, ſeeth Heaven open, and Chriſt ſtanding at the right hand of God; and ſo never ceaſeth to be victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, until it be overcome in an abyſs of Glory, and ſwallowed up in the beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical Viſion.</p>
            <p>To conclude. Let not this Faith which heretofore ſubdued Kingdoms, and wrought righteouſneſs, be it ſelf overcome by the iniquity of Chriſtian diviſions; This Faith which fought with beaſts at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> let it not be conquered by any brutiſh paſsion; Let not this Faith which hath hitherto ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced the Diſputer of this World, be now drolled out of the Church by the Atheiſt; This Faith which ſtopped the mouths of lions, let it not be devoured by the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi> of our age. In a word; Keep this Faith which renowneth Kings, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
