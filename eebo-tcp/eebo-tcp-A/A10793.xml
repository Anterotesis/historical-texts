            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong all euils, well-nigh infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
which, to the astonishment of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
man, haue taken strength this daie
in the world, the securitie of men, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying
the amendment of their sinfull
life, is not the least; which when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
and call into minde, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
I doo, I am not a little amazed. And
surelie forsomuch as the life of man (as
holie <hi>Iob</hi> dooth witnes, and experience dooth confirme) is but
verie short; and a Christian should euermore consider that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentlie
he either must or maie die, (for our Sauiour willeth vs
to watch continuallie, to be readie against death,) the foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of men in prolonging repentaunce from daie to daie, maie
well make all men to wonder; vnlesse they be of the sect of <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures,</hi>
supposing the soule to die with the bodie, and after death
no parte of man to remaine. For otherwise, he which hath anie
care of his owne saluation, and beleeueth there be after death
both rewardes for the godlie, and punishments for sinners, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
chuse but, not onlie for his owne part continuallie thinke of
repenting, while sinnes maie be forgiuen: but also in respect of
others, maruelouslie muze at their follie, which neglect a thing
so profitable, and so necessarie; and the more a great deale, for
that no man liuing is sure he shall liue, I saie not vntil night, but
an houre more, no not a minute or moment of time.</p>
            <p>But to saie nothing of the yonger and lustier sort, who thinke


<pb facs="tcp:5428:3"/>
they maie haue whatsoeuer they hope for, though fondlie, and
foolishlie they doo so: what doo doting and bald men in their
old age, when they should spend the time which they haue to
liue in none other cogitations, and workes, but such as pertaine
vnto the attainement of saluation? Surelie they thinke as little
of death as yong men doo: and so deferre the amendment of
their life, and neuer thinke while time is to repent, as though
they could promise manie yeeres moe to themselues; which
thing notwithstanding they should rather wish, than hope for.
Yea, which is more wonderfull, and showeth more plainelie the
dotage of old men, they blush not at foure score yeeres of age,
to marrie wenches vnder sixteene yeeres. What more? I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed,
it greeueth me to saie it, so I maie liue, and so I maie
haue Christ mercifull vnto me. Then what? wantonlie, delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
riotouslie they spend the time, they loue, they make good
cheere, they plaie the whore-masters, they are sweete in oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they take their pleasure; and as an old man in the
Poet saith:
<q>
                  <l>Because my daies be short,</l>
                  <l>which I haue heare to liue;</l>
                  <l>To women, wine, and pleasant sport,</l>
                  <l>my selfe I minde to giue.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The same doo our old men in words commonlie, in deedes
openlie saie, and confirme by their life. Neither doo they, which
commit these hainous offences, euen with hoare heads (for
whie should I be afraide to speake it) make anie great accoumpt
with themselues, or care of reforming their manners; but are
Christians in name onlie, but in deede and life nothing so.</p>
            <p>To come to the crooked old women, which haue had manie
husbands, what doo they? Surelie euen they too, when they are
most old, and full of wrinckles, make death a banquet (as the
Poet saith,) that is, they be not afraide to marrie yet againe:
whereas in deede, if they were touched with anie care of their
saluation, they should do better, if with <hi>Anna</hi> the Prophetisse, of
whom <hi>Luke.</hi> 2, 36, 37. maketh mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they neuer went out of the


<pb facs="tcp:5428:3"/>
temple, but serued God with fasting and praiers night and daie.
I speake not of the yonger women, for whom, according to the
sentence of <hi>Paule, 1. Tim.</hi> 5, 14. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7, 8, 9. it is better that they
marrie then to burne: but of old, and aged women, who in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their yeeres can beare no children. For they, after the
manner of doting old men (of whom I haue spoken) bid hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
fare-well, and care little what becommeth them. Such a
mischeef is in example. They alledge for them-selues solitarines
and pouertie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other (as they thinke) iust causes at those
yeeres and likelie: but pretend they what they will, yet shall they
neuer prooue their intemperancie good either before God, or
men, howsoeuer they cloake and couer the same.</p>
            <p>We dallie too much with our selues, we doo yeelde too too
much to our weakenes, or lust rather; we suffer our selues ouer
easelie to be snarled by the allurements of the flesh; we cast
not awaie the tendernes of our minde, we resist not the snares,
and ingines of Satan by continuall praier; we tame not our
bodie with abstinence, and fasting. Hence come the teares, as
it is saide; and this maketh such old marriages, in those yeeres
which call for a new life, and a new conuersation. For it were
time then, not to thinke of the short time, which is to be spent,
but of the life to come which alwaie shall indure. When thinke
you they will begin to amend, and haue regard of their saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
When will they repent? When will they prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnto death, which marrie euen when they are going to
the graue? Either I am deceaued, or this is not the waie vnto
heauen, as the Tragicall Poet dooth saie.</p>
            <p>Alack, alack, whether is the godlines of Christians gone?
Howe fewe are they, if there be anie at all, which call into minde
the shortnes, and vncertaintie of this life; death alwaies at
hand; the iudgement seate of Christ; the last iudgement; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
felicitie in the heauens; the torments and cursed
state of hell? Neither the regarde of the kingdome of God, and
of an happie life dooth stir vp vnto godlines; nor the feare of
hell, and euerlasting destruction either reclame from offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
or terrefie from sinne. Neither doo moste men giue credit
to the woord of God, and religion; or if they beleeue it, through


<pb facs="tcp:5428:4"/>
a vaine hope of Gods pardon toward the obstinate, and such as
perseuere in sinne; they moste foolishlie doo flatter themselues:
neither doo they endeuor by little and little to caste off wicked
custome, which in manner is turned into another nature. Sloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
and securitie hath inuaded them, being drunke as it were
with prosperitie; they are lead awaie and fed with a false and
foolish hope of longer life.</p>
            <p>Manie also through confidence which they put in the Popes
pardons; in the superstitious woorship of S. <hi>Barbara;</hi> and in a
Friers cowle, thinke nothing at all of amending their life. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
some are spilled either through wicked companie,
and too much familiaritie with vngodlie persons; or by
the Sermons of vndiscreete men, by such I meane, as preach
much of the forgiuenes of sinne for Christ his sake, and of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
righteousnes; but either nothing at all, or verie little at all
of dooing and following the will of God; and of the sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the spirit, wherebie we be renued vnto good woorkes.</p>
            <p>To be shorte: No man contemning earthlie, breatheth and
sigheth after heauenlie things; no man is touched with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of God against wickednes; no man blusheth at the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Gods commaundements; no man is reclamed either
from filthines through shame; or from sinne, through the feare
of God. So that euerie mans life is polluted with great sinnes,
and wickednes.</p>
            <p>And although I graunt, what <hi>Seneca</hi> in a certaine place
writeth, that <hi>Hereof our elders haue complained, hereof doo we
complaine, hereof they which liue after vs will complaine, namelie that
good manners be ouerthrowen, wickednes dooth raigne, the world wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
worse and worse, and falleth into all vngodlines:</hi> though I graunt
this, I saie, yet I dare affirme that in this corrupt, and wretched
age of ours, all manner vices haue so encreased, that hardlie
greater wickednes cannot be. For what sinne or wickednes at
this daie is wanting, which if it raigned, this age might be
saide to be the more vngodlie for that respect? When as
in deede we can neither patientlie abide to heare our
sinnes laide afore vs; nor quietlie suffer to be reprehended: or
if anie can, it is as much as if a tale were told to a deafe man


<pb facs="tcp:5428:4"/>
(as the saying is). For no man amendeth his life or manners;
no man reformeth his wickednes by contrarie vertues; no man
healeth his sinnes past, no not with the least good woorkes.</p>
            <p>I am greatlie afraide least in that daie of the great iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
our outragious wickednes; our lust, couetousnes, disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie,
pride, riotousnes wilbe condemned by the egregious and
most excellent vertues of Heathen men; as by the abstinence
of <hi>Aristides,</hi> the innocencie of <hi>Phocion,</hi> the holines of <hi>Socrates,</hi>
the almes deedes of <hi>Cimon,</hi> the moderation of <hi>Camillus,</hi> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie,
iustice, and faithfulnes of both <hi>Catoes;</hi> and who can recite
all of them? Yea, I am afraide, the sobrietie of the Turkes, will
condemne our gluttonie, and dronkennes. Yea, and <hi>Sodom, Tyrus</hi>
and <hi>Sidon,</hi> will there laie before our face our extreame wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
euen in this new light of the Gospell; so that in the daie of
iudgement it shalbe easier for these, then for vs: as our Sauior
vpon like occasion threatened certaine townes, as <hi>Luke</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
            <p>So that it plainelie appereth, how farre we be in deede from
right Christians, though we desire to be compted so. For in
vaine taketh he the name of a Christian to him, that dooth not
leade a life aunswerable and agreeable to Christian profession;
and (as <hi>Paule</hi> saith) <hi>worthie of God.</hi> Had we anie wit, the verie
name of a Christian would make vs blush, and be ashamed to
violate the commaundements of God.</p>
            <p>O would to God, that at the length, though late, we would
repent, and turne vnto God with our whole hart, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroie
our selues by deferring our amendment; the which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie-times
God punisheth both with sudden death, vnawares,
and also with euerlasting destruction: that in deede it standeth
vs vpon to haue in minde continuallie both death and hell, and
the tribunall seate of Christ; and to thinke that the eares of
our conscience be stroken both with the terrible sounde of
that trumpe, summoning vnto the last iudgement; and with
the dredfull voice of the iudge, condemning the wicked and
vngodlie mates vnto the fire which neuer shalbe quenched.
Now if these things doo nothing mooue the obstinate, I see not
what hope at all is left: and whether there be anie he dooth


<pb facs="tcp:5428:5"/>
know, who knoweth all things, euen God alone.</p>
            <p>But omit we vaine, and vnprofitable complaints. Therefore (to

of men in prolonging the correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their sinfull conuersation,
is so great: I haue thought good, to seeke, out according to my
poore skill, some remedie for that matter, &amp; to communicate the
same with the ruder sorte, if anie whit it may profit others. For
at the first I wrote the same for my priuate vse, that alwaie I
might haue before me that, which might waken me, as it were
out of the sleepe of too much securitie. Happie I saie much hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
is that man, which standeth in no neede of such a remedie
against the old man; nor of such a remembrance to cast-awaie
sloth. But, as I saide, the song which I sang to my selfe, I haue
thought good to impart with the simpler sorte, forsomuch as I
knowe in some respect it maie doo good; least with <hi>Aspendius</hi>
the Musicion, as the Prouerbe is, I sing within to my selfe. For
my desire is by all meanes to profit others.</p>
            <p>Which my labor I haue thought good to dedicate to you,
most gratious Prince, and that in none other respect, but to
leaue a publique monument of our obedience toward you.
Accept therefore these things in good part, after your
wonted goodnes, and protect vs, as you doo.</p>

            <p>For who is there so wicked, but will

            <p>O horrible iudgement to the vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.<note place="margin">A descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the iudgement to come.</note>
The remembraunce whereof at no

euerie mans conscience shall

and of his mercie preserue the

            <p>Neither at this iudgement shall

will not by the remembrance thereof

wicked; or detained backe, if he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined

            <p>If the flesh then prouoke anie man,

or to any other vices and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
let him remember the day of the

of Christ: If either anger vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengement,

the world vnto ambition, pride, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

the wicked vnto euerlasting fire.</p>
            <p>Would to God, oh would to God,
this day of iudgement were at no time
forgotten! then would euerie man doo
his dutie. Both Magistrates then
would seeke the wealth and welfare,
defend the libertie, and maintaine the
lawes and rightes of the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to their charge: and Subiects


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5428:9"/>
then would giue lawfull obedience to
their Magistrates, and at no time either
repine at their Gouernors, or withhold
tribute, or custome; but willinglie
would render all feare and due honor
vnto them. Both Husbandes then
<hi>would loue their wiues,</hi>

               <hi>according to the flesh, with feare and

               <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that euen their Maister also is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi>
Pastors then would haue that
care of the Lords flock, which they
ought to haue. Rich men would sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
the lacke of the poore. Widowes


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5428:10"/>
would continue in supplications and
praiers night and daie. The poore
would patientlie endure pouertie, sithe
it hath pleased the Lord to allot the
same vnto them. He which hath a
wife would so deale, as if he had none:
and he that is vnmaried, care onelie
for those thinges which may please the
Lorde. To be shorte; There is no man
but would doo his dutie, did he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
remember the daie of the laste
iudgement, at which time God will
aske an accompt of vs of our whole
life, and of euerie deede, which we
haue doone, and so appoint either
punishment, or reward, according to
euerie mans desert.</p>
            <p>In the time of a great plague,<note place="margin">Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men when they are sicke.</note> when
death is before mens eies, we see how
all men (be they not dissembling
Christians) are carefull to reforme
and amende their manners. VVhat
then?<note place="margin">Be such vvhen thou art vvhole, as thou vvert being sicke.</note> Ought we not at all times, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
hower, yea and euerie moment,
to thinke of the amendement of our
life; to be touched with a true, and


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:5428:10"/>
bitter sorowe for our sinnes, and to
pacifie the wrath of God by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
especiallie seeing, in respect of
vncertaine chances, death continualie
is imminent, and hangeth euerie
howre ouer the heads of all and euerie
of vs, as we are certainely to thinke.
Therefore who so is wise, will haue
such a care, as I haue shewed, as men
commonlie haue in a great pestilence:
at which time, as it were wakened
out of the sleepe (of securitie,) they
are wonte to take care, and to thinke
how to chaunge their wicked liues;
howe to flie and auoide sinne; how
to followe righteousnesse and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
finallie, how to please God by
repentance, who is displeased through
our sinnes. Let euery man then perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
so, when he hath escaped the
plague, as he purposed to be when the
sicknes was hot.</p>
            <p>All men acknowledge, that the
houre of death is vncertaine, yet is
it moste certaine that one daie we
shall die.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:5428:11"/>
Nowe what foolishnes is it, to feare
death, which euerie moment hangeth
ouer our heads; and in the meane time
not to thinke of amendment of life!
But thus it is. In aduersitie, as in the
time of the plague, of famine, of warre,
of Earthquake, of any greeuous and
dangerous sicknes of the body, we can
acknowledge the iust anger, &amp; displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God against wickednes: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
things flowe foorth according to our
harts desire, we blush no whit to abuse
his goodnes, and liberalitie, neither doo
we call into minde, neither death ready
to take vs euery howre;<note place="margin">1. The. 4, 16.</note> 
               <hi>Nor the last
iudgement, nor the voice of the Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell,</hi>
whereof <hi>Paule</hi> maketh mention
writing vnto the <hi>Thessalonians: Nor
the Trumpet of God:</hi> nor of Hell, either
the euerlasting punishment, or the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quencheable
fire, nor finallie that vtter
darkenes where shalbe weeping and
gnashing of teeth. The memorie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
should be fresh in our minde, both
when we rise from our beds in the
morning, and when we go vnto bed in


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:5428:11"/>
the euening; both when we dine, and
when we suppe, when we are washed
for health sake, when we deale in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that are serious: yea and when
we doo recreate our minde with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
sporte.</p>
            <p>But these things, to wit the last iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the Lords tribunall seate, the
voice of the Archangell, the Trumpet
of God, the euerlasting torments of
hell, these, (I saie,) are but a meere fable
to the vngodlie. And as the <hi>Ethnicks</hi>
in old time esteemed all fained whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
the Poets mentioned of <hi>Tartarus,</hi>
of <hi>Phlegeton;</hi> of the Iudges <hi>Minoes</hi>
and <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> of the place and
region of the wicked, and of the paines
of the vngodlie (whereof sprang that
of <hi>Seneca,</hi> saieng; <hi>The Poets haue batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and terrified our mindes with vaine
feares:</hi> So verie manie count all toies
and fables, yea and thinke all but idle
threates which at this daie we reade in
the sacred Scripture concerning Hell;
euerlasting death; Hell fire, where
shalbe weeping and gnashing of teeth;

and touching the covniting hereafter

they little thinke thereof, insomuch
that they haue no space to repent, and
amend their liues.</p>
            <p>Here I will not recite what <hi>Plinie,</hi> in
his naturall Historie, speaketh of sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
death, because in these daies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more common. Manie yeares


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:5428:14"/>
are not passed, since two old men,
dwellers in one towne together, hauing
on a certaine night had vnlawfull
copulation with two harlotes, whom
they haunted, died both of them sude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
the one of an Apoplexie, the other
thrust through with a Dagger. Now in
what da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger their soules were, let euerie
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> consider with himself for his profit.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant, that good men as
wel as wicked, may suddenlie be taken;
and that, <hi>though the righteous</hi> (as he
saith) <hi>be preuented with death,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wisd. 4, 7.</note> 
               <hi>yet shall
he be at rest:</hi> notwithstanding, how hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
is it for an impenitent person sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie
to be ouertaken after such a sort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
How manie haue we heard of, murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
through contention, euen when
they haue beene at good cheere! How
manie slaine foorth-with, taken in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie!
How manie at the Dice and
Cardes suddenlie dispatched, euen of
such as they haue plaied withall! That
I speake nothing of them, which falling
from their Horse, haue brake their
neckes; which through Shipwrack


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:5428:14"/>
haue perished suddenlie; which final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
either by the fall of houses, or other chances
haue beene bruzed into peeces!</p>
            <p>Therefore, albe God would the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
rather then the death of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as vndoubtedlie he would: yet is
it a dangerous thing, in respect of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
chances, to deferre the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our life, in hope of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.
For thou art in time to repent, while
thou art yet aliue, while thou art
strong, while thou art in health.</p>
            <p>But thus it is. The yong man giueth
himselfe to pleasure,<note place="margin">Yong men loue not to repent.</note> to bellie cheere,
to wine, to riot; and promiseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
manie yeeres, and a long life; and
therefore neuer thinketh of reforming
his manners, but deferres that matter
vntill he comes vnto age: yet is he not
sure whether he shall liue to be an old
man. For who among manie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
attaineth to old age?</p>
            <p>Now being an old man,<note place="margin">Old men vnwilling to amend.</note> what dooth
he then? To morowe it shalbe doone,
saith he, and still to morowe it shalbe
doone: &amp; so willinglie he deceaueth, &amp;


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:5428:15"/>
vainelie dooth flatter himselfe, because
no man, as I haue saide, can promise
that he shall liue till to morowe; naie,
there is no man sure that he shall liue
till night.</p>
            <p>In the meane season, Death suddenlie
oppresseth him that deferreth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth
the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his life, as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
daie almost we haue examples giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
yet doo not other mens harmes make
vs to beware: so mightelie dooth Satan
drawe on, and feede vs with a vaine
hope of Gods mercie, and of a long life.</p>
            <p>And although it neither ought, nor
in deede anie waie can be denied, that
the true penitent sinners at all times do
finde fauor at Gods hand; and that a
man neuer, no not at the point of death
should despaire: yet who is so foolish,
that maie haue that which is voide of
all danger, and will chuse that which is
ioined with great hazard euen of the
soule! Therefore to be out of all doubt,
let vs, while time is, thinke of amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
our liues, and not deferre the same
from daie to daie, especiallie because we


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:5428:15"/>
are not sure to liue till to morowe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nowe concerning the mercie of
God, let vs remember continuallie
what</hi> Cyprian, <hi>in a certaine place dooth
say on this wise;</hi> As much as God is good,
and mercifull, in that he is a Father: so
much is he to be feared, in that he is a
Iudge: so will it come to passe that the
feare of Gods vengeance will reclaime vs
from sinne; and the vaine hope of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
in too much securitie shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
and corrupt vs.</p>
            <p>In this vaine hope of Gods mercie,<note place="margin">The obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie of Popish Priestes.</note>
how miserabley doo those Popish
Priestes deceaue themselues, who all
their life time keepe concubines; and
vnder the pretence of a single life, plaie
the whore-masters, are neuer punished;
nor yet thinke of changing their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
manners, nor of putting their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines
quite awaie from them! Yea,
notwithstanding they know well their
owne filthines, and wicked life: yet
blush they not daie by daie almoste,
to doo the diuine seruice, to come vnto
the mysticall and diuine table, vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelie


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:5428:16"/>
to eate the Lords breade, and to
drinke the holie cup vnworthelie. Oh
how horrible, yea how dangerous is it
to liue in such state of life, wherein if
death suddenlie should strike thee,<note place="margin">That which the Auctor speaketh vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Priests: he speaketh first vnto all vvhich doo as they doo.</note>
thou wert vtterlie cast awaie! In vaine
therefore doo they flatter themselues
with hope of Gods mercie, which keep
concubines in such sorte, and with
hardened hartes persist in wickednes,
neuer minding either to put awaie, and
forsake their harlots; or to change their
wicked liues by hartie repentance; and
to aske forgiuenes of their lewde beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
at Gods hand with teares and
sighing.</p>
            <p>But, some will saie, they aske God
mercie oftentimes; and oftentimes
they beseech his goodnes to forgiue
them. For after their euening praier,
saie they not euerie daie welnigh? <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
vs, O Lord, and turne awaie thy
displeasure against vs.</hi> Yea, and in the
ende of their Mattins too, doo they
not saie? <hi>Lord haue mercie vpon
vs.</hi> And at other times, <hi>that God


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:5428:16"/>

not?</p>
            <p>I heare you.<note place="margin">Praiers of Popish Priestes vvhat.</note> But with what earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of minde, with what heate and
zeale of spirite they doo so, I will not
dispute. Be it, they praie vnto God ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louslie,
earnestlie, and with a moste
hartie affection; what then? what good
do their praiers, vnlesse they put awaie
their concubines, with intent neuer

they perseuere in a purpose, and
minde, to liue chastlie euer after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
in a studie of amending their

for their wickednesse committed?
Now, because they doo not this, as
their deedes plainelie show, who doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
but either they thinke those
things written concerning the daie of
iudgement, to be but a fable; or that
they flatter themselues too too much
with a vaine and false hope of pardon
at Gods hande?</p>
            <p>O horrible face of the Popish Church!


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:5428:17"/>
They which aswell by example, as by
praier, should rule; gouerne, and teach
others; eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they so behaue themselues,
that others in them be maruelouslie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded.<note place="margin">Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Laie peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Popish Priestes.</note>

it is meet they should, with what feare,
&amp; trembling, with what zeale do they
approche? what preparation doo they
make before they confesse their sins, &amp;

that no scruple remaine in their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
&amp; minde! how certainlie, &amp; firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
doo they purpose to amende their
manners, and to reforme their life!</p>
            <p>Nowe what doo the Popish Priestes?
Forsooth (as one of their owne crewe
reporteth) they from the wicked em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement
of an whore hasten vnto the
altar, and that commonlie, vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
without blushing. They are tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
neither with a care of amending

sorrow at the remembrance of sinne.
To be briefe, in name onelie and word,


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:5428:17"/>
they be Christians, but in deede and
truth they appeare plaine <hi>Ethnickes.</hi>
VVhat then? some may demaunde, is
there no hope of saluation of such?
Surelie, to speake my conscience, they,
who are such, as I haue described, can
haue no hope of mercie before God,
forsomuch as the Auctor of the Epistle
vnto the <hi>Hebrues</hi> dooth affirme,<note place="margin">Hebr. 13, 4.</note> that
<hi>VVhoremongers and Adulterers God will
iudge;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5, 21.</note> and <hi>Paule</hi> saith, <hi>They which doo
such things, shall not inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God.</hi> VVherefore if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
beleeue it to be true, as it is, which
the Apostle hath saide, what hope can
they haue to be saued, abiding in such
filthines of life? especiallie seeing they
neither vnfainedlie repent, nor will put
away their concubines. But if they
doo not beleeue it to be true, then false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
doo they vsurpe the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and are not to be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the godlie: but should be to vs,
as our Sauiour dooth saie,<note place="margin">Matth. 18, 17.</note> 
               <hi>As Heathen
men and Publicans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How then doo Bishops tollerate such


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:5428:18"/>
vngodlie fellowes in their Churches?
Yea &amp; why allow they such to preache
vnto the people? yea, why for mony do
they permit them to haue harlots? The
matter is manifest; so that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied;
&amp; so foule and abhominable, that
it neither ought, nor maie be excused.
And although they denie that they are
altogether vngodlie; because they haue
the name of God in honour: yet mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
is it that they are not godly, because
they followe those things which are
cleane contrarie to godlines, as <hi>Hilarie</hi>
speketh of such like. And they are nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
those, who, being not grieued at this
filthines, and wicked life of their shaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
show plainely that they abhorre
the honest &amp; <hi>vndefiled bed,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
saith, that is; the honest and lawfull
mariage of the ministers of the holie
Church. Oh horrible case to heare oh
wretched &amp; miserable state of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
people! Come Lord Iesu, come, and
helpe thy Church, which now a long
space hath had those pastors vnder the
popish tyrannie: which are vtterlie in a


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:5428:18"/>
manner destitute of all Christian faith.</p>
            <p>They beleeue, will some saie, to haue
saluation through Christ. Go to, for
we will not striue much about that
point, let vs thinke it be so. What? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
they that, which the Apostle
saith, <hi>VVhoremongers shall not inherite
the kingdome of God?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5, 5. Gal. 5, 21.</note> They beleeue so, I
thinke; neither maie we suspect the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.
Now forsomuch as they are of
that nomber (for that must needes be
gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted which no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may denie) which
<hi>Paule,</hi> or the holy spirit rather by <hi>Paule</hi>
saith, <hi>shall not inherit the kingdome of
heauen;</hi> howe can they promise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
saluation through Christ? then
beleeue they, both that they shalbe sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued;
and that whoremongers, as they
are themselues, shalbe condemned. Oh
immortal god, what blokishnes is this!
what blindnes of hart! what darknes of
minde! See they not what contrarieties
they speake? For if they haue an assured
trust that they shalbe saued (for that is
it which we call beleefe;) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is false
which <hi>Paule</hi> vnto the <hi>Ephesians</hi> dooth
write:<note place="margin">Ephe. 5, 5.</note> but if it be sin, as it is, to saie so,


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:5428:19"/>
they can haue no faith or trust that
God the Father is mercifull to them,
and pleased through Christ. Then
what is their beliefe? what makes them
to promise to themselues saluation?
what faith haue they?</p>
            <p>VVhat force our conclusion hath;
euen a blinde man maie see, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
saying is. For the Apostle dooth
propose and affirme,<note place="margin">Eph. 5, 5.</note> that <hi>No whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger
shall inherite the kingdome of
God.</hi> The whole world maketh the
Minor, and saith with one consent,
<hi>Popish Priestes are such.</hi> Hereof doo the
right Christians conclude, that no
<hi>Popish Priestes with their concubines,
shall inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> All
men, though they haue but meane skil
in Logique, see that this conclusion
followeth of the former propositions,
which are manifestlie true, and granted
euen of our aduersaries. For this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is made in right moode and
figure. Popish Priestes therefore with
their harlots haue none hope to be
saued; neither doo they beleeue, as


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:5428:19"/>
they falselie reporte, albeit they feine
certaine vaine dreames to themselues
concerning faith. But some will saie,
It maie be, that they who to daie are
wicked, to morowe, or when God
thinkes good, may repent, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
their faults, liue the time which
they haue to spend in the feare of God:
and therefore we should not so quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
despaire of anie mans saluation.</p>
            <p>I know it well, but it appeareth how
these felowes are onte to returne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
godlines; and how vnfeindlie they
repent. For what one of manie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
haue you seene heretofore, which
comming vnto himselfe, hath either
cast off his whore, or determined neuer
to haue companie with her hereafter? I
speake that which is well knowen, and
what we at this daie doo not onelie see
with our eies: but also euen well nigh
feele with our handes, if so I maie saie.
Not one of a thousand scarse, can you
finde, which from his harte at anie
time purposeth to amende, or to put
awaie his concubine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:5428:20"/>
But to let these things go,<note place="margin">The defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of the Popish Church.</note> how abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
in the mene while (be it spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

pastors and rulers of the christian flock,
doo openlie to the great offence of the
Church commit wickednes; wherein
whoremaisters adhorte vnto chastitie;
impenitent persons vnto repentaunce;
they who are defiled with all impuritie
vnto holines! And these things are
doone, not in villages onelie: but in
townes also and citties; nor in a fewe
regions onelie, but in euery land beside;
and in all places where the Pope hath
dominion; yea the verie Bishops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
loking on, winking therat; what
saie I, winking thereat? permitting, and

do not seuerelie punish this wickednes,
as by their office they are bound, but as

in wickednes; &amp; prick forward, &amp; giue

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
they giue them occasion obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natelie

            <p>What I praie you,<note place="margin">The office of Bishops in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing levvde Clergie men.</note> may some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund,

I will tell you. They must (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
teacheth) not winke at such wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
much lesse allowe, and maintaine
the libertie of whoredome, but first <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish,
improoue, rebuke;</hi> afterward, if
these doo no good, remoue them from

banish them from the temples and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments;

may be saued in the daie of the Lord Iesus.</hi>


               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:5428:21"/>
These thinges they should doo, if their
minde were to execute their office vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightlie,
and to be allowed before God
the iudge, who will aske an account of
them for all their doings. <hi>Cheefelie and
aboue all things they should showe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
an ensample of good workes,</hi> as
<hi>Paule</hi> admonisheth <hi>Titus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2, 7.</note> and be <hi>to
them that beleeue, an ensample in woord,
in conuersation, in loue, in spirit, in faith,
and in purenesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4, 12.</note> as he warneth <hi>Timothie.</hi>
But at this daie, the Bishops for the
moste parte, showe themselues to be
such, as they suffer the Clergie to be:
whereby it falleth out, that what by the
licence, and what through the example
of Bishops: that they sinne more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie,

when men giue vp the ghoste:
beside, they sing Dirges, wherein it is
often repeated, that <hi>that daie is a daie of
wrath, a daie of trouble, and heauines, a
great daie, and a verie bitter;</hi> and often
mention is made of the dreadful iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of euerlasting damnation, and of
the theefe repenting at the last gaspe;
finallie, wherein request is made, that
neither torment of death maie touch,
nor chaine of the damned may binde:
furthermore, they attend on the Herse,
and followe the Corse; and with great
ceremonies burie the dead, and commit
the bodie to the earth: beside this, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the temple they oftentimes
reade Epitaphes, and verses both writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and grauen vpon Tombes and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers;
wherebie occasion is giuen
to remember not onelie the dead: but
also death it selfe imminent euerie

they heare of the comming of Christ,
of the resurrection at the laste daie, of
the sound of the Archangell and trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet

they cannot be brought vnto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
one of these two things must
needes be true, that either they thinke
whatsoeuer they reade in the sacred
Scripture touching the iudgement to

do) perswade themselues that the soule

vsed to delicious fare, and pleasures
from their tender yeeres. They ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine
neither from foule and filthie
speech, not from wicked and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
oathes; to the dishonor of God.
They ruffell it out in their gorgeous
apparell of diuers colours, Soldier like,
with their parted brest, and their pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
hose. They do all things proudlie,
boldelie, impudentlie; but nothing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destlie,
and shamefastelie. They neither
doo honor their parents; nor reuerence
their elders, nor beare with their equals:
breefelie, what they minde, they thinke
they may doo. Neither shame of the

which might not honestlie be doone:
but rather to leade such an honest and

well, and by looking vpon their sayings
and dooings as into a glasse, learne euen
from their infancie, both what is to be
doone as good, and what to be auoided,
as wicked and abhominable. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
teacheth that by outward beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,

while he chides them, he accuseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

let parents remember, that necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie
they are to leade an vpright, and

Scholemasters for the most part
(for all be not such) what to get fauour,
&amp; to auoide the displeasure of parents,
bring vp their Schollers too nicelie, and


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:5428:25"/>
too wantonlie, and as it were loose the
raines of discipline, neither driuing
them by correction from wickednes:
nor alluring them by counsell vnto

Christianitie, nor instruct them in

neither pure and holie to their

as companions. Hence ariseth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
in them of their maisters; hence
come they headie and proude; hence
doo they loathe all goodnes, hence
intollerable stubbernes. What should
I speake of their prodigious attire? of
their vnseemelie apparell? of their iet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

at by their maisters? or their often, and
well nigh dailie rioting, banqueting,
gossiping, quaffing, plaieng, dauncing,
reuelling all the night together? to adde
nothing more filthie. I name that


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:5428:25"/>

            <p>Notwithstanding, how in this pointe
now a daies men offend, no tongue can
expresse. For now there is no place for
godlie and learned Schoolemaisters,
whose honest life, commendable beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,

Vnlearned Sciolies doo euerie where so
creepe into the freendship &amp; familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of mightie men, and so perswade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that they alone are thought to be mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
(when they are as meete for that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:5428:26"/>
as the Asse is for the harp, according
to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> saying) to gouern Scholes,

And for that in respect of their

what maruel, if hardlie, or not at

old age, whereunto they were accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in their youth! custome so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

when the daie of iudgement comes into

yet custome hath so marred them,
that, whether it be vnwillinglie or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

good members of a Common-weale
shall we thinke they will prooue in
their old age, which in their youth are

would there be such large scope

            <p>Let euerie magistrate therefore thinke
vpon his office, and perswade himselfe,
that when Christ shall returne to iudge
the world, he must yeeld an accompt;
and learne of <hi>Paule,</hi> that <hi>he beareth not

of God, to take vengeance on them
that doo euill,</hi> as the same <hi>Paule</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
vnto the <hi>Romaines.</hi> And for so
much as <hi>Paule</hi> dooth witnesse, that <hi>the
Lawe is not giuen to a righteous man,
but to the laweles and disobedient, to the
vngodlie, and to sinners, to the vnholie,
and to the prophane, to murtherers of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and mothers, to manslaiers, to whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,
to buggerers, to manstealers, to
liers, and to the periured;</hi> and because in
his office the magistrate is a minister of
the lawe, doubtles he cannot be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
or slacke and dissolute in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without great sinne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:5428:28"/>
VVherefore such as beare auctoritie,
and rule in the Common-weale must
remember, that loosenes of behauiour,
and wildenes must be tamed, and brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by euerie good meanes, and that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
must be terrified from vice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
from naughtines, and from all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
and deadlie and hainous crimes
through the feare of punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Vnles
they do so, they make themselues guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of horrible sinnes, and shall aunswer
for the faults of others. For, as the Poet
saith:
<q>
                  <l>He that may restraine vvickednes &amp; vvil not,</l>
                  <l>Dooth vvill men to sinne, and spare not.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I am afraide the seuerenes of <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nickes</hi>
in punishing sinne,<note place="margin">Pagans more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing sin, then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</note> and cutting
off malefactors, wilbe a witnes against
our negligence and slothfulnes in that
point, at the daie of iudgement. They
had their punishments appointed by
lawes for offenders; there lacked no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
to cite them vnto iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
they had examiners and iudges;


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:5428:29"/>
finallie, they had executioners, which
with all seueritie punished wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
And so by that meanes wilde
heads were enforced to absteine from
il dooing; to bridle desires; to tame their
concupiscence; and not to rush head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into all wickednes, euen through
the feare of punishment. But now a
verie blinde man (as the saying is) may
see, how outward and ciuile ordering
of manners is decaied, by reason of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punitie,
and libertie which is granted,
in that such as are in auctoritie, doo ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
negligentlie forgiue all, or not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerelie
enough punish malefactors.
None correct whoremongers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowrers
of maidens, no nor adulterers,
and other more hainous offenders, so
greuouslie as they should; none punish
either disobeiers of parents; or despisers
of their superiors; or backbiters of their
lawfull Magistrates; None represse of
apparell, either the prodigalitie for cost;
or the pride for color, &amp; finenes; or the
lightnes for varietie; or the impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
for the monsterous new facions:


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:5428:29"/>
None doo forbid that infinite expences
vpon banquets; pompous &amp; princelike
feasting; outragious quaffing; conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
drinking; nor continuall sitting
at bellie cheere; none doo appoint pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
for dicers; vsurers; ingrossers;
forestallers; back-biters; nor for such as
for-sweare them selues; nor for curssers;
not yet for blasphemers. I saie nothing
neither of those common Stewes in
manie townes; nor of the libertie
which popish Priestes haue to keepe
whores; nor of the impunishment of
all sinnes for monie, where the Pope
hath to doo.</p>
            <p>It is the part therefore of all in aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
to meete with these mischiefes;
and without delaie to punish offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
that others maie take heede.<note place="margin">VVhat cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or discipline is vsed.</note> For
in correcting they must haue regarde
vnto these three thinges, either to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
him whom they punish; or to
make others to beware of committing
the like wickednes, by his punishment;
or finallie, that such as are well giuen
maie liue the more safelie, the wicked


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:5428:30"/>
being cut off.</p>
            <p>Little good hetherto hath beene
doone by lawes; therefore the matter
must be gon about another waie, to
haue the better successe. For, as the
Apostle saith, <hi>the Magistrate beareth
not the sworde for nought.</hi> Let him then,
when occasion serues, drawe out the
same, let him strike therewith to the
cutting away of sinne, and let him haue
a care that he be not blamed for negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in that behalfe, that in respect of
discipline we be not worse than the
verie <hi>Ethnickes,</hi> nor giue occasion to
the enemies of Christianitie to thinke
ill (as they doo) of the Gospell, and of
our profession, because of our life and
ill behauiour. For what? Can the
Turkes beleeue that religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be good
whose professors they see with their
eies to be of all men the most wicked,
and prophane? They will obiect, and
cast in our teeth so manie whore-mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
so manie ruffins and spend-thrifts;
so manie dronkards; so manie adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers;
so manie Epicures; that we maie


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:5428:30"/>
be ashamed to heare so much. They
will inueigh against our wickednes,
they will laie in our dish luxuriousnes;
they wil tel vs of our lecherie. And thus
for our behauiour sake, both religion
it selfe, and Gods word is ill spoken of;
&amp; as <hi>Paule</hi> saith, <hi>The name of God is blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed
among the Gentiles through vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although, to iudge rightlie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
in euerie age there hath beene rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes;
sumptuous feasting; costlie
dinners and suppers; surfetting; dron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes,
who redome, adulterie, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
iniurie, neglecting of well dooing,
and other such wickednes, which euery
man in his time hath found fault with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
as <hi>Seneca</hi> doth saie, and no age that
hath beene voide of sinne:<note place="margin">VVicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes neuer at such ripenes.</note> yet loosenes
of life, neglect of order and discipline,
outragious wickednes, hath in this our
age so encreased, and got strength: that
it appeareth euen <hi>Atheisme</hi> and <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme</hi>
hath inuaded the life of man, and
as it were beareth dominion among
Christians; lawes take no force, lust
ruleth altogether.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:5428:31"/>
For these euils therefore it were the
parte of magistrates bothe spirituall,
and temporall, to finde some remedie,
as they whom God hath exalted, and
preferred by strength and honor,

            <p>I saie therefore once againe, let ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
remember their duties: and
what wickednes they cannot vtterlie

they are not able to make men good
(which belongeth vnto God alone:)

consisteth the safetie of Citties, magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
must haue a speciall care hereof,
and see that parents doo their dutie in
bringing vp their children aright vnder
correction. If this were doone, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
would not take such roote, as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
it hath: which otherwise by no

keepeth a man from dooing

forsomuch as lawes reforme
what is doone amisse, but education
quite remooueth the same; it plainlie
appeareth, that this dooth more good
to the Common-weale, than lawes do.


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:5428:32"/>
That I adde not, how they which haue
naughtelie beene brought vp, doo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
cast off all feare, and reuerence
to lawes, wherebie punishments are
appointed to transgressors.</p>
            <p>And therefore it hath beene the chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
studie of wise gouernors,<note place="margin">The chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest care of Magistrates</note> not with
what punishment they might afflict
the wicked and transgressors; but how
to bring it to passe, that their Subiects

               <hi>I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

For wealth, pleasure, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
prosperitie would not suffer
him to thinke of amending his life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hetherto maketh that of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
in</hi> Matthewe: A rich man shall
hardlie enter into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
<hi>and,</hi> It is easier for a camell to goe
through the eye of a needle, then for a
rich man to enter into the kingdome of

expounding the same, dooth saie,</hi>
Children, how hard is it for them that
trust in riches, to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God! <hi>It maketh also to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
that Christ calleth riches and
pleasure of this life,</hi> thornes, which
cheake the seede of the worde, and make
it vnfrutefull.</p>
            <p>This then is the cause,<note place="margin">VVhy God sendeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 6</note> why God
sometime sendeth aduersitie; and, as he
saith, chasteneth whom he loueth,
namelie that they maie shake off secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and both be stirred vp to feare and
call vpon God, whom oftentimes in
prosperitie they forget; &amp; be also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to confesse their sinne, to repent,


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:5428:35"/>
and to thirste after heauenlie thinges,
despising earthlie. For in them which
haue the world at will, there dooth
raigne a maruelous securitie, which is
nombred among the deadlie offences;
and their mindes be inuaded with sloth
and carelesnes, and with a certaine
nummednes and sencelesnes, whereby
they neglect heauenly things; finallie
idlenes, faintnes, rechlesnes, vnwildenes
sleepines, and if you will haue it so,
(for by all these names I see I cannot
sufficientlie expresse what I thinke)
drowsines taketh them in such sorte,
that they haue no minde to doo well,
nor to liue honestlie. Such is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of this vice.</p>
            <p>The Scripture also showeth, that
prosperitie maketh men not onelie se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
but blinde also, and vngodlie
manie-times: which made <hi>Moses</hi> to
saie: <hi>VVhen he waxed fat, he spurned with
his heele thou art fat, thou art grose, thou
art laden with fatnes: therefore he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke
God that made him, and regarded
not the strong God of his saluation. They


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:5428:35"/>
prouoked him with straunge gods,</hi> and so
foorth.<note place="margin">State of Dauid a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure sinner.</note> This made <hi>Dauid,</hi> hauing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his enimies on all sides, when he
was quiet, and thought all things well,
not onlie to fall into adulterie: but also
to defile himselfe with the murder of
an innocent man. And he, who in the
persecution of <hi>Saule</hi> behaued himselfe
well, in prosperitie prooued wicked.
So greatlie hath he to looke that he fall
not, which thinketh he dooth stande.
Yea after he had committed those
sinnes, how secure was he for a long
space? For, though there hung no
daunger ouer his head, forsomuch as
God is mercifull, he went as well as the
best vnto the tabernacle, he kept the
Sabaoth and other holie daies; he was
at sacrifices making, and offered giftes;
to be breefe, his minde was without
care. But, when God by the Prophet
<hi>Nathan</hi> denounced vengeance,<note place="margin">State of Dauid a penitent person.</note> and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
and stroke him with feare
and terror, then at the length comming
againe vnto himselfe, he considereth
what he had committed, and waieth


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:5428:36"/>
the greeuousnes of the sinne, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conceaueth much sorowe through
the remembraunce thereof, and plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
confesseth his offence, and humblie
craueth pardon of God, and desireth to
be washed from his sinne, to be clensed
from his wickednes, to haue the filth
of his vncleanes wiped awaie: yea, he
neither refuseth reuengement, which
God had threatened; nor praieth to
escape the punishment, which he had
deserued.</p>
            <p>Would to God the like securitie were
not in vs, who for the moste parte liue
so without care, as if all were well; we
neither confesse our sinnes, nor yet
feare the sharpe iudgement, and heauie
hande of God against wickednes. So
farre be we, <hi>from weeping so aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
as we haue greeuouslie transgressed,</hi>
as that holie Martyr of Christ <hi>Cyprian</hi>
dooth saie.</p>
            <p>But to returne vnto our matter, and
to conclude in fewe words: No man
can be saued, but they whose sinnes be
forgiuen. And no mans sinnes be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen,


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:5428:36"/>
except he aske forgiuenesse. No
man dooth aske forgiuenes, but he
who desireth to come into Gods fauor
againe. And no man desireth that from
his hart, vnlesse he be touched with a
sense and feeling of his wickednes.
And no man is sorie for his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
but he that confesseth them, and
perceaueth the wrath of God against
sinne. But this dooth not a secure man,
for he is touched with no care of his
saluation. Hee to whom all things
fall out prosperouslie, &amp; is (as he saith)
dronken with sweete fortune, is such a
person. Therefore it is euident, that
wealth and prosperitie is a cause,
that men haue no care of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
their manners.</p>

            <p>Some perhaps will thinke it follie
and madnes for old men to become

hope of vndoubted long life. So that
this hope is the cause, why no man

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:5428:40"/>
to come againe into Gods fauor. And
when we doo so, litle too we minde to
continue in those thinges which we
haue set downe: so farre be we from
examining our consciences before we
go to rest, and from considering how
we ought to liue, or with sobs &amp; teares,
and striking our breasts, prostrate vpon
the ground, from asking forgiuenes
of the Lord; from vowing a new life;
and from endeuoring to abide and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

well.</p>
            <p>Yet for all this we are not afraide, in
such a cursed state of life to sleepe, and
to snort too in securitie; wherein if
sudden death should strike vs (as no
man is sure that he shall rise in the
morning, when he goeth vnto bed) we
are vtterlie damned, and cast awaie.
But litle doo we thinke of these things,
so greatlie doo we flatter our selues,
through a vaine hope of longer life.
Now for so much as commonlie we
see, many are deceaued through such

and freedome to commit wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
and through this vaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
driue off to amend from daie

            <p>An other cause of deferring and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing

<hi>Barbara,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Barbara.</note> they shall neuer die vnpeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and without receiuing the holie
Communion. For this superstition of
the worshipping of <hi>Barbara,</hi> hath pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
the mindes of all worldlinges,
where the Pope hath to doo. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a fast is consecrated to her euerie
yeere to be kept: and Painters haue set
her forth in the likenes of one holding
a cup, and holie bread in her hand.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, manie haue a great
care, and long a fore doo prouide, that
when the houre of their death shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche,
they may be adopted into Saint
<hi>Francis</hi> familie,<note place="margin">S. Francis.</note> and buried when they
are dead, in the habit of a <hi>Franciscane.</hi>
For this opinion is rooted in all their
mindes, that the diuel hath no power
vpon them, which can attaine thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:5428:43"/>
inasmuch as the Monkes doo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
vpon them, together with their
habit, all the merites and good workes
of their whole order, as namely Masses,
Church seruice, praiers, preachinges,
meditations, fastinges, abstinence, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils,
pilgrimages, and such like. For
Monkes hereby, leauing alwaies that
which is sufficient vnto saluation, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing happelie doo remaine, and be
superfluous, as lightlie there is, that
they communicate with other, not
<hi>Gratis,</hi> but for moneie. So that, as I
haue saide, this also is a cause, why
men, that haue bought the good deeds
of Monkes, and the communion of
godlie merites, at no time doo thinke
of amending their life.</p>
            <p>But in this place it is needeles to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell,

the companie, and familiaritie of such

            </p>
            <p>Here I would haue Parentes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that they are to vse great dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
in keeping their children from

are ioined to them in much familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

finallie, which doo seeke their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
For such is a man, for the most

               <hi>But heare what an aduersarie of ours
doth saie:</hi> VVe take our manners from
such as we companie withall. And as some
diseases come to the bodie, and infect
them which touch it: so the vices of the
minde pollute them which are next. The


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:5428:44"/>
dronkard draweth his familiars vnto the
loue of wine. The companie of lasciuious,
doo effeminate euen the strongest man.
Couetousnes spueth foorth her poison vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
her companie. Such is the force of
vertue, and of the vertuous on the other

            </p>
            <p>He therefore that desireth to liue
godlie, holilie, and to keepe him selfe
pure, and whole from all infection of
wickednes, which euerie Christian
should desire to doo, must flie and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide
the companie of the wicked.
For they which addict them-selues
wholie to keepe companie with such,
and abide with them from daie to
daie, making merrie, feasting, eating
and drinking together continuallie;
they sildome or neuer will thinke of
amending their life, neither can they be
driuen easilie from their pleasaunt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship.</p>
            <p>So that although they freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t godlie

in authoritie; yea, and them-selues too,

In the meane while, when they litle
thinke thereof, sudden death many
times striketh them vnawares. For, as
euerie man is sure to die: so the houre
of death is vncertaine. And therefore
we are willed in the scripture to watch,

full zelouslie: but of newnes of life in

            <p>Againe, God giueth the holie spirit
to such as beleeue and call vpon him,
which maie raise new motions in the
heart, and as it were regenerate the will
of man, and driue him vnto all duties
of godlines, and to all vertues seemelie
for a Christian; and finallie, to a life
aunswerable and agreeing to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the Gospell. Of which we
haue spoken at large in an other place.</p>
            <p>Oh how much are the mindes of

an adulterer, a fornicator, a couetous
person, or defiled with any other vice
or wickednes; beleeue onlie, and thou
shalt be saued. As for the lawe, thou
needest not feare it: for Christ hath
fulfilled the lawe, and satisfied for the

without peraduenture, doo much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend

that of <hi>Esaie, Let the wicked forsake his

that God is gratious and merciful, but

of thy sinnes with teares, and sighing,
be thorowlie out of loue with thy selfe
for wickednes perpetrated and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;
leaue thine owne waie, and

then assure thy selfe of saluation:
despaire not, neither doubt thou

of our Sauiour, <hi>That ioie shalbe in

               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:5428:53"/>
Seeing you saie so, hearken vvhat in

            <p>You beleeue I am sure, that which

For if you beleeue, that <hi>Paule,</hi> or the

            <p>There is no cause then, why through
hope and confidence of pardon at Gods
hand thou shouldest prolong thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion,
and flatter thy selfe. Repent,
&amp; come into the waie againe: and then,
doubt thou no whit, but thou maist
make thy selfe a large promise of Gods

securitie; let vs not forget God in pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie;
let vs feare the wrath of that
Iudge, before whose iudgement seate
we are all to stand, to pleade our owne
cause, our owne conscience accusing,
and bearing witnes; either with vs for
wel-doing; or against vs for our wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes.</p>
            <p>It falleth out for the most part, that
prosperitie puffeth vp the minde, that
rich men are proud, that wealth makes
men head-strong. We should therfore
continuallie vse wel our good fortune
and prosperitie: we should looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and againe, least this temporarie


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:5428:58"/>
happines bring vs vnto eternal miserie,
and destruction.</p>
            <p>VVhat is then to be done? That <hi>Paule</hi>
writing vnto the <hi>Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> sheweth in
few words: <hi>Hereafter,</hi> saith he, <hi>let both
they which haue wiues, be as though they
had none; And they that weepe, as though
they wept not; And they that reioice, as
though they reioiced not; And they that
buie, as though they possessed not; And
they that vse this world, as though they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it not; For the facion of this world
goeth awaie.</hi> In which wordes the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
sheweth, that we must haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
no care at all, or that our least care
should be either of wiues, or of prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
or aduersitie; or finallie of riches
and wealth of this world: but that our
chiefest, yea, and onlie care is to be cast
vpon heauen, and heauenlie thinges.</p>
            <p>Not without cause did <hi>Paule</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
<hi>Timothie,</hi> to <hi>Charge them that
are rich in this world, that they be not
high minded, and that they trust not in
vncertaine riches, but in the liuing God.</hi>
And <hi>Dauid</hi> in the <hi>Psalmes</hi> doth saie, <hi>If


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:5428:59"/>
riches encrease, set not your heart thereon.</hi>
Riches are not simplie condemned, the
which godlie men haue possessed: but
the trust in riches, and the pride and
hautines which ariseth from riches, is
condemned. For wealth commonlie,
and prosperitie, are woont to make
men haue stomackes, and hie mindes.
Hence that in the Comedie, <hi>Because
wealth is encreased, their mindes are
exalted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He therefore which hath gathered
riches, and enioieth the world at will,
let him both yeeld thankes to God for
the same; and take heede that he insult
not, and waxe high minded; yea, and
also let him againe and againe too, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore
bring his fortune into suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion:
but aboue all vse he dilligence,
that through securitie (as manie doo)
he forget not God; and that he neuer
leese the sense of Gods vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sinne, nor haue his minde either
occupied with idlenes, nor inuaded by
negligence.</p>
            <p>Of which vnles he beware, it is


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:5428:59"/>
doubles to be feared, least leaning too
much vpon present happines, he be
carried awaie with a false ioie; and least
flattering him-selfe with hope of long
prosperitie, the feare of God being quite
remoued, in the meane while he be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed:
as commonlie the death of
death commeth vpon vs, when we litle
looke for the same.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore place before the eies
of our mind that saying of the Apostle,
<hi>VVhen they saie, Peace and safetie,</hi> saith
he, <hi>then shall come vpon them sudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</hi>
So then, as the same Apostle
warneth vs, <hi>let vs not sleepe, but let vs
watch, and be sober.</hi> Neuer let vs saie, we
shall haue peace, euill shall not come
vpon vs: or as they did of whome the
Prophet <hi>Esaie</hi> maketh mention, who
saide, <hi>VVe haue made a couenant with
death, and with hel are we at agreement:
Though a scourge runne ouer, and passe
through, it shall not come at vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the old, and also in the newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
we maie finde many, both te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies
of Gods displeasure against


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:5428:60"/>
wickednes; and examples of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
vpon the vngodlie, by the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
whereof, euerie man to his profit
maie shake off carelenes in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
For it is not our minde in this
place to alleadge all, least our booke
doo growe ouer-big. Let it neuer be
forgot, which <hi>Moses</hi> mentioneth of
mankinde, which was drowned by a
flood in the beginning of the world; of
the vtter consuming both of <hi>Sodom &amp;
Gomor</hi> by fire; of the manifold, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
calamities of the people of <hi>Israel;</hi>
of the often carying them into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
by barbarous nations for their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of godlines; nor finallie, which
ecclesiasticall histories doo write, of the
ouer throwe, wasting, and destruction
of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> For all these thinges are
writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as <hi>Paule</hi> writing vnto the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
doth saie) <hi>To admonish vs, vpon
whome the endes of the world are come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now what punishment the Lord
hath laid vpon particular men for their
wickednes, it were long (as I haue said)
and needeles to show. I wil alledge but


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:5428:60"/>
one for example sake: When that noble
&amp; deerelie beloued of the Lord, <hi>Dauid</hi>
I meane, at what time he was through
much prosperitie secure, had fallen into
the filthie sinne of adulterie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
the greatnes thereof, by the
murthering of an innocent man; with
what miseries and calamities did God
afflict him, yea, after he had repented,
and was restored into Gods fauour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine?
For God plagued him both
with the death of his Sonne newlie
borne; and with the rebellion of his
owne children; and by his woful flight
from <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> and with violence
offered to his concubine by his owne
sonne; and with defection of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes;
and finallie (to omit other
thinges) with a great slaughter of
his people. So horrible and hore
is the wrath of God against wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
            <p>If so holie a man, no not after his
repentance and comming into Gods
fauour, as the bookes, wherein the
Actes of the Kinges of <hi>Israell</hi> be


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:5428:61"/>
contained, doo witnes; if, I saie, so holy
a man after his repentance scaped not
vnpunished for his sinnes committed:
what thinke you shall betide them,
which are touched with no griefe of
their wickednes? which securelie doo
sinne, and proceede from one sinne
vnto another; finallie, which with
obstinate heartes persist in vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes?</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore cast off al slouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes,
and that sleepie and drousie se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie,
when we haue the world at wil;
let vs liue in the feare of the Lord; and
make sure our saluation with feare and
trembling; let vs not suffer our selues
to be entangled with the wicked intise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
of the flesh; and finallie, by
continuall praier, let vs resist the
tentation of Satan.</p>

            <p>Finallie, if you thinke it most true,
let euen common experience moue vs.
Oftentimes thou art with such as are
grieuouslie sicke, without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie;
thou art present when they
giue vp the ghost; thou hearest the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

vpon the beare; thou followest the
coarses vnto the graue; thou seest them
laide into the earth; thou hearest the
pitteous crie of mourners; thou readest
Epitaphes engraued on tombes; thou

be moued through the death of our

that consider not our owne infirmitie,
through the troubles of others; let vs
confesse our frailitie, and mortalitie of
mankinde, at least wise through our
owne weaknes where-withall we are
tempted. VVhich thing if we would
doo, we shall perceaue there is no cause
why we should flatter our selues with

            <p>But, som wil say, I may ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d my self,

But who is sure he shall liue till he be
old? Thinkest thou, which neglectest,

and ouer-passest the offered time, and
occasion to repent; thinkest thou, I saie,
to haue the like oportunitie when thou

Thou art deceaued, surelie thou art
much deceaued, if thou thinke so.
God of his mercie, which desireth the
conuersion, rather then the death of a
sinner, when he thinketh good, calleth
thee vnto repentance; and, as he in
the <hi>Reuelation</hi> saith, <hi>Standeth at the

that ye receaue not the grace of God in
vaine. For he saith, I haue heard thee in
a time accepted, and in the daie of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
haue I succoured thee. Behold now


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:5428:63"/>
the accepted time; behold now the daie of
saluation.</hi> By which words the Apostle
sheweth, that the time which God
offereth for repentaunce, is not to be
ouer-slipt; and that like occasion is not
alwaies giuen. Hetherto belongeth
that vnto the <hi>Galathians: VVhile we
haue time, let vs doo good.</hi> And not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trulie
saide an olde writer: <hi>He which
hath promised pardon to him that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth;
hath not promised another daie of
life to him that dissembleth his sinnes.</hi>
Take heede therefore, that by procra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinating
repentance, and that through
hope of longer life, thou wittinglie and
of purpose, doo not tempt the Lord,
whose goodnes inuiteth thee vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
The which we are forbidden
by an expresse commaundement of

            </p>
            <p>It falleth out many times, that men
are killed suddenlie, euen in brauling,
playing, and quaffing together; so that
he can haue no time to aske mercie at
Gods hand for his wickednes: when
as we in the meane while, through the


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:5428:64"/>
singuler goodnes of God, haue time
and space to returne vnto godlines.
Wherfore let vs not abuse this so great
mercie of our most gratious God, who
looketh and longeth too, as it were for
occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to shew mercie vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. Amend
we our sinful liues, least being suddenly
preuented with death, as the Church
doth sing, we seeke time to repent, and
cannot finde the same. And certainlie,
<hi>He which hath promised pardon to him
that repenteth</hi> (as euen-now I said, and
must often saie) <hi>hath not promised ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
daie of life, to him that dissembleth
his sinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, as some saie, in the time of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
a sinner maie repent. He maie doo
so, I graunt: notwithstanding, marke
how many impediments come then in
the waie, which verie hardlie can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided.
For, to saie nothing of the
care vvhich the sicke hath of making
his vvil; of prouision for his vvife, and
children; of the paine of sicknes, and
such like, vvhich maie seeme of small
importance: how doth Satan bestirre


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:5428:64"/>
him-selfe then, vvhat engins doth he
set to bring the poore soule vnto des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration,
through laying his manifold
offences before his eies? For then chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
if euer, he rippeth vp, and bringeth
into remembraunce whatsoeuer euil a
man hath either thought, or wild, or
said, or done; and such faultes, as of
them-selues are great and hainous, he
doth make much greater then they be:
and by all meanes doth studie to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
him from hope of saluation, and
to driue him vnto despaire for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
and great offences. Hetherto
belongeth the griefe of a guiltie consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
the great feare of death before his
eies; the wofull and bitter cogitation
of Gods iudgement seate; the dread of
a seuere sentence, which wil sore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maie,
and trouble the minde; the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
remembrance of the paines of hel:
and who is able to repeate all the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments,
and causes which let men, that
they cannot so much as thinke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
at that time?</p>
            <p>Doo not therefore, doo not, if thou


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:5428:65"/>
be wise, deferre the amendement of
their life, till the last daie. For that is
a verie dangerous matter: that I saie
not, how such a repentance, for so much
as of necessitie it springeth, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted,
through the feare of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
rather then taken in hand of pure
zeale, is of small force to get pardon.</p>
            <p>But no repentance is too late before
God. I confesse so much. For, <hi>At what
time so euer a sinner dooth repent him of
his sinne, I wil put all his wickednes out of
my remembrance,</hi> saith the Lord. And,
as the Prophet in another place, <hi>God
desireth not the death of a sinner, but that
he repent and liue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what if sudden death take thee
vnawares; that thou canst haue no
time to lament, and to repent thee of
thy sinnes? For all men should looke
for that, which maie happen vnto all
men. Let the vnlooked for destruction
of them, vpon whome the towre in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>
fell, as <hi>Luke</hi> recordeth, come into
your minde. VVhat if suddenlie you
should leese your wits and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;


<pb n="123" facs="tcp:5428:65"/>
as we see many doo? The which
if it should fall out (as it maie happen)
then gone were all hope of repenting,
which the sinner had placed in prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the amendment of his life. For
that maie betide thee, which hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to others: that you maie thinke
you are not exempted from that which
is common to all men. For a true say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is that of <hi>Publius, That maie happen
to euerie man, which maie happen to anie
man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cast awaie therfore all hope of long
life, then the which vndoubtedlie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more vaine, &amp; fleeting; neither
doo thou dreame of occasion, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
a time wherein thou wilt repent;
nor finallie, doo not thou nourish thy
foolishnes, or madnes rather in defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the reformation of thy sinfull life,
through this deceiptful hope. VVert
thou wise, thou wouldest repent at that
time wherein thou maist offend. For if
thou minde then to repent, when thou
canst sinne no more, doubtles thou dost
not leaue sinne, but sinne thee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:5428:66"/>
Furthermore, it is to be feared, least
seeing when thou maist thou wilt not
repent, that when thou wouldest, thou
maist not. For the iudgementes of
almightie God in punishing mans wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
are vnsearchable. For as his
woont is of his goodnes and mercie, to
giue them space of repentance, vvhich
are prepared readie, and willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
mercie; yea, and in the meane
while with much patience and lenitie
to beare with sinners, vntill they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
from their wickednes: so when
he seeth any man vtterlie bent vnto
vngodlines, and deriding Gods long
suffering, and so worthie damnation,
then ceaseth he to hold such a one back
from falling into destruction, and so
(according to the phrase of scripture)
blindeth the desperate, and hardeneth
the obstinate: neither dooth he looke
any longer for his conuersion, nor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
occasion for the damned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
For God hath appointed a time
and manner for each man, the which
no man in wickednes maie ouer-passe;


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:5428:66"/>
and God will not prolong his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and paine of sinne. The which
should stirre vp all men to repent with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
delaie, and to prepare them-selues
to receaue the grace of God.</p>

prolong not the amendement of

death so vncertaine. The which death,
for so much as in respect of vncertaine
chaunces, it is alwaies nigh, and maie

so by dailie acquaintance of the godlie

but haue no dealing at all with those.
<hi>Salomon</hi> in his <hi>Prouerbes</hi> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

I graunt, diuers other causes there
be, why he would haue such to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided,
either because we maie seeme
in no sort to allowe the sinnes and
wickednes of these men; or that such
whome all men doo so auoide and

maie repent. Notwithstanding, it is
not the least cause, that the contagion
of wickednes doo not redound vnto
such, as are ioined vnto them in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
For, as a litle leauen maketh a

            <p>And although it be hard and verie
difficult, to for sake their acquaintance

merelie, a long time, &amp; iocundlie hath
liued: yet earnestlie thou must ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor,
and labour with carefulnes by all
meanes to depart, and plucke thy selfe
from their companie. If thou but
from thine heart once minde the same,
without doubt thou wilt finde better
successe then thou art ware of. And


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:5428:70"/>
for so much as, according to the Greeke
prouerbe, <hi>The beginning is as good as
halfe:</hi> and, as <hi>Horace</hi> doth write, <hi>He
which hath begunne, hath halfe done:</hi>
set vpon the same at the least, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire
not of the successe through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the difficultie.</p>
            <p>Now, as commonlie it falleth out,
if thou thinke of the bankets, the
feastinges, the reare-suppers, the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges,
and such like fond and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
things which thou hast vsed with
them; and if thou against thy will
remember thy companions, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
mates, call into thy minde foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the shortnes of this life; the
nighnes of death; the last iudgement;
the tribunall seate of Christ; hel fire,
and euerlasting damnation. And
so, as the saying is, <hi>Thou shalt driue
out one naile by the force of another.</hi>
If these thinges come into minde, and
thou thinke thus with thy selfe: <hi>My

            <p>Therefore, as I saie, thou must take
a space to deliberate, and make some
delaie. When any such thing, by the
suggestion of Satan, commeth into thy
minde, throwe awaie thy weaknes of
minde, and loase not the bridle by and
by to thy lust, for then thou wilt runne
as the Diuel would haue thee.</p>
            <p>Doo thy companions inuite thee
to the Tauerne? Call thou into thy

a certaine place doth saie; <hi>Take heede

end, nor measure: euerlasting
death; vnquenchable fire; vnspeakable
tormentes; the fellowship of Diuels;
the societie of the damned; horror;
anguish; trembling, both euerlasting
for continuance, and vnmeasurable for
greatnes, such as neither mans minde
can conceaue, nor any mouth declare!
I saie, what man is there, but wil be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifed
by <hi>that daie of wrath,</hi> as both the

cloudes and blacknes;</hi> at what time <hi>he
wil reward euerie man according to his
workes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that the cogitation and memorie
of these things were continually fresh
before the eies of the minde! vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
then, either I am much deceaued,
or men with more dilligence would
obserue Gods commaundements; they
would study earnestly both to abstaine
from sinne and wickednes, and also to
liue vprightlie, and vertuouslie all the
daies of their life.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, what if here in this world
vertue sometime be rewarded, as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
and il behauiour is punished?
And to saie nothing of the conscience,
whereof we haue spoken at large in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bookes, let vs bring out those
things which in a manner we doo feele
with our hand, much more see with
our eies. For, that I may begin with


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:5428:76"/>
the most vsual vice, what euils doo not
follow dronkennes and gluttonie? For,
as he in the Storie of the world doth
saie, Hence commeth palenes of the
face, hanging cheekes, sore eies, palsie
in the handes, ouglie dreames, and
vnquiet sleepe in the night. Hence
proceede stincking breathes, hed-aches,
weake memories, dul wits. Hence
are ingendered grieuous diseases, as
ache of the iointes, goutes, the falling
euil, as both Phisitions doo affirme, and
dailie examples testifie.</p>
            <p>Now, touching whoredome, how
in this our age doo we behold the same
to be punished with the French-pocks;
as also other immoderate venerie with
the palsie; with the blearednes of the
eies; with the quiuering of the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes!</p>
            <p>As for luxuriousnes, doth it not
bring manie a man vnto neede, and
beggerie? Adulterie, is it not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
punished, and they which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the same alwaies after infamous?
Besides, the angrie man, doth he not


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:5428:76"/>
oftentimes get hurt, and the proude
man hatred?</p>
            <p>What shall I saie of Enuie, is it not
a punishment to him which is giuen
there-vnto? doth it not eate vp, and
consume the enuious? As rightlie did
one saie,
<q>
                  <l>The <hi>Sicilian</hi> Tyrans did neuer finde,</l>
                  <l>A greater plage then enuy to the mind.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So did another,
<q>
                  <l>Th'enuious man doth pine away in paine,</l>
                  <l>To see another florish wel, and gaine.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now to speake of couetousnes, is it
not euermore tormented, as with desire
of getting, so with feare of forgoing?
For that which a couetous man hath,
wil not content him: and that which
he hath, maketh him to feare, least he
loase the same.</p>
            <p>Thus you maie see, how that vice
and wickednes are often punished, yea,
in this world. Now, if these thinges
doo nothing moue vs, yet should
the euerlasting tormentes of hell,
threatened to the wicked in the holie

For thus many times I doo reason
with my selfe:</hi> What <hi>Riuius,</hi> what
if at this verie instant of time, thou
shouldest leaue this world, in what state
shouldest thou be? Art thou wel prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to die? For albe thou reposest thy
confidence, as it is thy part to doo so, in
the infinite mercie and goodnes of God,
haue you not neede for all that to stand
infeare of his iustice? How manie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes
of Christians; how manie young
men, old men, of middle age, women,
wiues vnwedded: finallie, of all degrees,
of all ages, and of all kindes, whose sinnes
are neither for number so manie, nor so
hainous as thine, and yet are damned
to euerlasting tormentes? O horrible
iudgement of God, yet a righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
How manie Iewes are in hel;
how manie Idolaters are punished with
perpetuall paines? The which had esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
those paines, had they bene conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto the faith of Christ, as we are
through the goodnes of God, seeing they
liued farre more vprightlie in the world,
then we haue done? O cursed ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

of ours; O the hardnes of our harts!
I saie, what if it were saide vnto thee,
as it was saide vnto <hi>Ezechias?</hi> Put
thine house in an order; for thou shalt
die, and not liue: what wouldest thou
doo then? I thinke thou wouldest craue
longer life, that thou mightest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
thy sinnes, repent, and aske God
mercie. VVhie then dost thou not
that daie by daie, all thy life long,
which thou vvouldest doo at such a
point?</p>
            <p>By these cogitations, as I saie, I am
woont maruelouslie to be inflamed to
liue well; to flie sinne, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
mercie at Gods hand. Let
others then, as like this
woont, place the same
before their eies.</p>

to vse the wordes of S. <hi>Paule, through

with all endeuor looke that thou feede

Ghost doth not assist cowards, slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardes,

which worke, and labour earnestlie to

            <p>Aboue all, be thou terrified from

through the presence both of God, who
euerie, and no waie can be auoided;
and of his holie Angel, thy keeper, and

to abstaine there-from through reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence

So doo all thinges, as though some man
sawe thee. It is doubtles good to appoint
a keeper ouer thy selfe; to haue one vpon
whome thou maist looke backe, whome
thou maist suppose is priuie to all thy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations.
A great part of wickednes
is left vndone, if one be present when a
man is about to sinne. <hi>Thus councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
an</hi> Ethnike, <hi>which I would haue
euerie man suppose to be spoken to
him-selfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore thou enterprise any thing
which is filthie and wicked, before thou
goest about the same, thus reason with
thy selfe: what is that I doo? Shall I
commit that in the sight of God, which
for my life I would not haue any man
to know? Should I driue awaie the
Angel appointed to ouer-looke me by
this crime: which would not loase
the friendship of a mortall man? Shall
I grieue the holie spirit; to make the
euil spirit reioice through my falling?


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:5428:81"/>
Hath Christ redeemed me with his
precious blood, that voluntarilie I
should giue my selfe into the bondage
of Satan? Hath he redeemed me from
sinne, to the end I should runne head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into wickednes? Hath he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made me an heire of heauen, that
through mine owne default I should
forgo the same? Where is now my
zeale to God-ward? where is my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend
feare of his maiestie? where is
my faith and godlines? Is this the
thankes I giue to my God, for his so
innumerable benefites? Is this the
thankes I doo yeeld to Christ for my
saluation? Doo I thus submitte my
selfe to the direction of the holie spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit?
With this holines doo I approch
vnto the Lordes table? Looke I for
the comming of Christ after such a
sort? Shall death laie hold on me in
this state of life? Shall I go vnto the
iudgement seate of God in this pickle?
Shall I suffer mine affections to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile;
the weake flesh to ouercome;
sinne to raigne in my bodie? Am I so


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:5428:81"/>
voide of stomacke, and courage, that
I can-not resist the motions of the
minde? Doo I behold the better, and
yet chuse the worser still? These and
other thinges (for who can recite all)
thinke dailie with thy selfe; so wilt
thou not easilie doo that which is not
seemelie.</p>
            <p>Then, to come vnto an end, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
thou goest about, perswade thy
selfe, that God is present (as in deede
he is) and beholdeth all thy doinges;
and therfore stand thou in awe of him,
and let the reuerence of him with-draw
thee from wicked enterprises. For (as
the Poet saith,)
<q>
                  <l>He witnes is, and Iudge also,</l>
                  <l>He so doth view the heart of man,</l>
                  <l>That euerie thought he wel doth kno,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This also wil further thy zeale to

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:5428:82"/>
regeneration, and, which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
honour, the brother, and heire
annexed with Christ. For who wil
not be inflamed mightelie vnto god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,
and with a Christian feare, and
shame abhorre sinne, when he shall
call into remembraunce, how that
God is his Father? Doo not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I saie, doo not forget this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite
at anie time; loue him, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
him, serue him, honour him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore,
who hath made thee his
sonne by adoption; and neuer doo
anie thing which maie displease him
hencefoorth. Fulfil thou his wil, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beie
his commaundement, keepe his
lawes. Thinke with thy selfe, that
not onlie the participation of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance;
but also the imitation of his
vertue and goodnes doth belong
vnto thee: so that although thou
canst not by imitation attaine vnto
that singularitie of goodnes which is
in the Father: yet endeuor thou ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie
to come nigh the same, and
thinke it a most shamefull thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:5428:82"/>
there-from. And if at anie
time vnwittinglie thou co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittest som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
contrarie to thy Fathers minde
(as great is mans frailtie,) let it much
grieue thine heart; punish thy selfe
therefore, thinke no paine grieuous
enough for thee, who hast offended
so mercifull a Father; and neuer be
quiet in minde, and at rest, til thou hast
recouered thine offence with greater
good deedes, and pacified thy Father
by vnfained repentance. So farre shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thou be from sinning voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and from committing anie sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
thy conscience.</p>
            <p>And, who so remembreth howe
that he is the sonne, and heire of God,
the brother &amp; heire annexed to Christ,
doubtles, wil be terrified from sinne
and wickednes, not so much for feare
of the last iudgement of euerlasting
tormentes, and of hel fire, which
neuer wil be quenched; as for feare
of displeasing his so louing Father;
and will endeuour to liue godlie, to

offend no man, after the example of
the Father, to doo well to all men,
not so much in hope of reward in

            <p>To aunswer in few wordes, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
cause is, the naturall wickednes
that is in vs, &amp; the proanesse which we
haue to sinne, which cleaueth to our
bones and bowels; that is to saie, the
verie flesh that we beare about, which
hath a grieuous and troublesome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
and a continuall fight in a manner,


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:5428:84"/>
with the inner man, as witnesseth <hi>Paul.</hi>
So that we must resist the same, when
it inticeth vs vnto lust, and filthy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
vnto the vices of the throate and
bellie; vnto lasciuiousnes and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and vnto other vices and vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest

bridle the same by godlie cogitations,
exercises, watching, abstinence, and also
tame and bring it vnder by continuall

            <p>This made our sauiour Christ to wil

to commaund vs, <hi>to watch and be sober.</hi>
VVith this we must ioine continuall
praier, and earnest calling for the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

deadlie enimies, with whome we
haue continual warfare; for they wil
not suffer vs to abide in our godlie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose

stirreth vnto ambition, pride, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ottousnes;
vnto anger, hatred, enuie,

occasion to fall vnto other vices,
which no man is able to number, they
be so manie; it marreth by euil exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and corrupteth with offences.</p>
            <p>The Diuel for his part neuer ceaseth
to bring and driue man to contemne
the word of God; to mistrust his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises;
to conceaue amisse of him; to
persist obstinatelie in wickednes; to

            <p>VVhat is now to be done in this

valiantlie resist these enimies; we must
take a courage vnto vs; and by earnest
&amp; zelous praier craue the helpe of God;


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:5428:85"/>
through confidence wherof we should
neuer giue ouer the battel. Touching
which point, let vs heare what S. <hi>Paule</hi>
writeth vnto the Ephesians: <hi>Finallie
my brethren,</hi> saith he, <hi>be strong in the
Lord, and in the power of his might. Put
on the whole armour of God: that ye may
be able to stand against the assaultes of
the Diuel. For we wrestle not against
flesh and blood, but against principalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
against powers, against worldlie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerners,
the princes of the darknes of this
world, against spirituall wickednes in the

the armour by name, he biddeth vs, to

            </p>
            <p>Thus you see the armour, which we

who intermitteth no daie, nor

<hi>like a roaring Lion, seeking whome

vpon sinne, and destruction, wherevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Sathan driueth vs, and fauour
our owne weaknes: but with a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
let vs resist the Diuel, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of God the eternall Father of our
Lord Iesu Christ, that he would
strengthen our weaknes. And for
so much as the Diuel doth not alwaie
set vpon vs openlie, but some-time
secretlie, and by vndermining, and
often-times (as one saith,) <hi>Doth flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

            <p>VVhere manifest feare is, <hi>saith</hi> Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
the weake is the more easelie taken.
<hi>Let vs therefore cast from vs all slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gishnes,
and our too much securitie;
let vs feare, that</hi> vnder euerie stone, <hi>as
the common saying is,</hi> there is a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion;
<hi>and as though all were safe, and
at a good staie, let vs not be secure.</hi>
No man commeth sooner to destruction
(<hi>as that Heathen saith</hi>) then he which
feareth nothing: and the most vsuall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of miserie, is securitie. Thinke
not foorth-with thou shalt haue peace, or
that thou art quit from all daunger, if
thou hast once obtained victorie ouer
thine enimies. <hi>Thou must euermore
keepe the battel, and be readie to fight:
as well said</hi> Cyprian, In the world we
are continuallie to wage battel with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
continuallie we must fight against his

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:5428:86"/>
               <hi>saith he,</hi> with auarice, with lecherie,
with anger, with ambition; we haue an
eger and continuall fight with carnall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
with the enticementes of the world.
Hardlie can the minde of man go against
euerie one, with much a doo it resisteth,
being besieged, and round about inuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the armie of Sathan. If aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
be laide flatte on the ground, lust ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
vp; if lust be quenched, anger moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth;
pride, puffeth vp; dronkennes,
allureth; ielosie, parteth friendship, <hi>and
so foorth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as we ought not to insult, if
we get a conquest: so must we not
despaire, or fling awaie our weapons
by and by, if we be ouercome. VVhat
must we then doo? Surelie to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
our honour againe, we must set
vpon our enimie with more courage;
and with a newe power make amendes
for our former faintnes, and foile: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the example of that noble war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,
whome <hi>Virgil</hi> maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of, which being beaten to the
ground with great force, nothing ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refied


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:5428:87"/>
with the fall,</p>
            <q>
               <l>VVent to the fight more fierce againe,</l>
               <l>which did his courage fresh renew:</l>
               <l>And shame did make him fight amaine,</l>
               <l>So did his prowesse which he knew.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Albeit we must not encounter with
the enimie, trusting to our owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wesse,
but to the power of God.</p>
            <p>Thus you haue the causes, why we
doo not persist in our purpose of liuing
godlie, after the wil of God. For, as
I saide, one cause is, the wickednes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed
in our flesh, and our proanesse
vnto sinne: another is the world, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
infinite occasions and causes dailie
to offend; the last is, the Diuel who
continuallie is thinking of our destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ouerslippeth no minute of

fraude, to ouercome vs.</p>
            <p>O God, father of our Lord and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
Christ, proceede we beseech thee
in helping vs, in this hard, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
warre which we haue with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:5428:87"/>
enimies; and for so much as of our
selues we are vnable to resist, confirme,
and strengthen vs with thy holie spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that we maie both represse the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the flesh, and neuer be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the allurementes of the same;
and also valiantlie, resist as wel the
world offering so manie occasions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie
to sinne, as the Diuel casting
all sorts of dartes to hurt vs, and vsing
all meanes to bring vs to destruction.
And, that we maie not onlie abhorre
sinne and wickednesse, through a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
feare of Gods wrath and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
death, which the lawe doth bring,
terrefying vs with the anger and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, and striking men with
the terror of hell: but also, and the
more a great deale, maie be crowned
through childrens feare, which ariseth
from faith, with a certaine honest
shamefastnes, and through a religious
reuerence toward God, to commit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at anie time, which maie offend
our most louing, and best father: Also
which maie make vs so of our owne


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:5428:88"/>
accord to doo wel, and to flie from
sinne, and so keepe vs through loue and
charitie in our calling, that when vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wittinglie
we shall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any offence,
as great is our weaknes, it maie bring
such a sorowe and griefe to our minde,
that both we maie willinglie enioine a
punishment to our selues, and be loath
to liue; for that we haue offended so
merciful, and gratious a Father.</p>
            <p>Finallie, O eternall Father, graunt
for thy sonne, our Lord and sauiour
Christ his sake, that in such shortnes
of life, and vncertainty of death, we put
not of the amendment of our life, and
deferre the same from daie to daie: but
maie with speede endeuour to returne
vnto wel-doing, confessing our sinnes,
and vnfainedlie repent, and through
repentance, pacifie our heauenlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and with the Publicane in the
Gospel humblie, striking our breast,
craue mercie of God; and finallie wil,
and doo those thinges which are grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and acceptable before God: that
we maie amend our wickednes by wel


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:5428:88"/>
doing; reforme vices with vertues; and
through Gods assistaunce spend the
time which we haue to liue in this
world, godlie, religiouslie, innocentlie,
purelie, soberlie, and temperatlie, to the
profit of the Church, the benefit of
mankinde, and the discharge of our
duties; and that in such mindes, and
godlie determination we maie conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue

            <head type="sub">A briefe repetition of that
which hath bene saide; with a
short conclusion.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus much I
thought good
to write of
mans foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
in putting
of the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this
life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:5428:89"/>
The matter which I haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
hath enforced me to vtter those
thinges which wil be as to the godlie,
comfortable; so to them which would
seeme, but are not vnfained Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
vnpleasaunt. For we haue
spoken much, and aboundantlie of
the shortnes, and vncertaintie of
life; of death in respect of vncertaine
chaunces dailie hanging ouer our
heads, and many times dispatching
men before they be aware; the which
all good men doo wish, and desire of
God in their godlie praiers, but the
wicked do abhorre. Also we haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the generall resurrection, of the
comming of Christ, of the last iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when all men shalbe summoned
to giue an accoumpt of their life spent;
which daie wil be to the wicked hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
but comfortable to the godly. For
then, <hi>their redemption draweth neere;</hi>
then is the time, as one said in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
of comfort, and refreshing; and, as it
is in <hi>Tertullian, the daie of Christian
triumphing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:5428:89"/>
Furthermore, we haue told both
what rewards be appointed for the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and what punishmentes ordained
for the wicked. For the godlie shalbe
exalted vp vnto glorie, and liue a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and euerlasting life in heauen. For
who is able to expresse what a felicitie
it wil be, alwaies to behold God, and to
enioie the most comfortable contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of his heauenlie countenance,
to behold him euen as he is, whome
<hi>now we doo see through a glasse darklie,</hi>
as <hi>Paule</hi> saith! to abound with all good
thinges? finallie, to enioie so manie
pleasures and delightes, as maie be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conceaued in minde, nor expressed
by wordes?</p>
            <p>On the other side, the vngodlie shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
throwen headlong into hel, to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with vnmeasurable, and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
tormentes. No eloquence can
describe by wordes, nor wit conceaue
the smallest part of the paines which the
vngodly are to endure in hel being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
through the righteous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God vnto euerlasting fire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:5428:90"/>
Last of all, we haue vttered diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thinges, which, as I said, wil please
the godlie right wel; but trouble the
wicked: as of the sense of Gods indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
against sinne; of casting of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie
when we haue the world at wil;
of vnfained repenting; of reforming
our manners; of amending our liues;
of our continual fight with mightie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies,
the world, the flesh, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel;
and diuers such like things, which
are needles to be repeated in this place.</p>
            <p>Sharpe these are, and sowre to blood
and flesh: notwithstanding, as I am
perswaded, verie profitable. For, as one
in <hi>Curtius</hi> doth saie, <hi>Phisitions doo
heale sore maladies, with sharpe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines;</hi>
and as <hi>Cicero</hi> writeth vnto <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius,
No medicines applied vnto wounds,
doo so grieue, as they which are most whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the eternall God, father of our
Lord and sauiour Christ, giue grace,
that this our booke, how so euer it be
written, maie in this corrupt and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
world, yet some-what keepe the


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:5428:90"/>
godlie in their calling, and confirme
them in wel-doing; if anie of zeale,
and wel-liking thereof shall reade the
same: furthermore, that it maie offer
some occasion to the wicked, to reform
them-selues; and that the salue which
is here prescribed to such as are sicke,
and almost past recouerie, maie haue
strength to helpe and heale them. This
he graunt, without whose helpe, all the
labour of man is vaine, and to no
purpose, euen God almighty, and
most righteous, to whome be
all praise, honour, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
now, and for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
