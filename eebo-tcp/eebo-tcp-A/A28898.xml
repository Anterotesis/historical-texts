            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A WARNING from the LORD GOD to the Inhabitants of the Town and County of WARWICK, That they may Repent and Turn to the Lord with their whole hearts, before it be too late.</head>
            <p>YE Inhabitants of the Town and County of <hi>Warwick,</hi> prepare to meet the Lord by ſpeedy Repentance, leſt the over-flowing ſcourge come and ſweep you into the Pit from whence there will be none to deliver your Souls; Therefore mind what the Lord requireth from you, Who is <hi>Merciful,</hi> and <hi>Gracious,</hi> and <hi>full of Compaſſions</hi> let ſuch as have lived in Drunkenneſs refrain from it, and do ſo no more; and ſuch as have lived in Cheating and Cozning, and Deceiving, let them do ſo no more; and ſuch as have lived in Malice, and Envy, and Wrath, let them refrain from thoſe things and do ſo no more; and ſuch as have Hated, and Perſecuted, and Impriſoned the Servants of the Lord, let them do ſo no more; that ſo you may <hi>find Mercy and Forgiveneſs with the Lord, who is to be feared.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turn ye to the Light within which ſhineth in your Hearts, which lets you ſee your ſins, that ſo by it you may be led unto God, that His Salvation you may know. For this is <hi>the Grace which hath appeared,</hi> even <hi>to all,</hi> which Grace <hi>will teach you,</hi> as you it love and obey, <hi>to deny ungodlineſs, and to live ſoberly righteouſly and godly, while you have a time in this World;</hi> This Grace will teach you <hi>to Love your Enemies,</hi> and <hi>to do good to them that hate you;</hi> This Grace will teach you <hi>to pray for them that deſpitefully uſe and intreat you;</hi> And alſo it will teach you <hi>to do to others as you would be done unto,</hi> and to ſeek others welfare as your own. And be ye warned to take heed of Malice, and Wrath and Envy, that you harbor no ſuch thing in your hearts againſt any; For know ye, that whereſoever this appears, that the Devil is the Author thereof, who was a Lyar and a Murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the Truth, and it was him that ſtirred up <hi>Cain</hi> to ſlay his Brother <hi>Abel, becauſe his own works were evil and his brothers good;</hi> and ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>Him that hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a Murtherer, and we know,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that no murtherer hath Eternal Life abiding in him.</hi> And it is ſaid in the Holy Scriptures, <hi>The Innocent and Upright ſlay thou not,</hi> whoſe Cauſe the Mighty God will plead, and ſave them whoſe hearts are upright before Him, whoſe truſt is onely in the Lord; But it will go ill with thoſe that gainſay the Truth. Therefore while you have time prize it, and bring forth fruits unto God, for all fruitleſs Trees, that <hi>Cumber the ground,</hi> muſt <hi>be be he<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>en down and caſt into the fire.</hi> And though you have been often warned already from the Spirit of the Lord in his Servants, yet the Lord hath put it in my heart once more to warn you, that ſo you may repent and find Mercy with <hi>Him who is to be feared:</hi> But if you ſhall ſtill refuſe to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Counſel of the holy One, and ſhall run on in Rebellion and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion againſt the Lord, by adding Sin unto Sin, and Tranſgreſſion unto Tranſgreſſion ſtill for all this, then ye will ſurely periſh, and wo and miſery will come upon you, <hi>The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi> Therefore prize your time, and obey the Light of Chriſt in your Conſciences, that ſo you may know Him to ſave you from the Evil to come.</p>
