            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Now is the Time.</head>
            <p>THE thing that offers it ſelf in this great <hi>Conjuncture</hi> is, to have a <hi>Grand Committee</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> (Forty at leaſt from each Houſe) to be as a <hi>Privy Council,</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> or governing <hi>Senate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were to be wiſhed, that Twenty of each Forty might be for life; and the other Twenty Biennial, Ten going off every Year. Or half might be changed Annually.</p>
            <p>Each <hi>Senator</hi> or <hi>Counſellor</hi> to have for his Salary or Maintenance, a thouſand pound a Year. This would be ſuch an Advancement to the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> as <hi>England</hi> never ſaw. And the Charge is a Trifle. There is more ſpent in ſome <hi>Monarchies</hi> upon Hawks, Hounds, and Whores.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> to preſide in this <hi>Council</hi> or <hi>Senate</hi> (or ſuch Perſon as he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point in his ſtead) and to have <hi>Ten Votes</hi> at leaſt. He muſt alſo be <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Admiral</hi>; and muſt have ſuch further Powers, and ſuch a Maintenance or Revenue, as his infinite Merits require. But withal, ſuch as are conſiſtent with the <hi>Government</hi> he deſigns for us. The <hi>Prince</hi>'s Maintenance ſhould equal, or exceed, that of all the <hi>Senators</hi> put together.</p>
            <p>All that are of this <hi>Council,</hi> and all that hope to be (that is, all the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Men of the Nation) will by this means be firm to the <hi>Prince.</hi> And ſo will thoſe others who have the great Priviledge of Chooſing them, whereby they may have confidence in their Adminiſtration. And this one thing will give the <hi>Prince</hi> ſo ſtrong an Intereſt, that he needs fear no Pretenſion that can be againſt him. It will be better than a <hi>Standing Army</hi>: the neceſſity whereof nothing can prevent, but ſuch a Standing Council.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> to be Choſen Triennially, and to meet Annually.</p>
            <p>It is believed that ſuch a Conſtitution as this, would effectually ſecure us (according to the <hi>Princes</hi> good Intentions) from <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny.</hi> And the <hi>Prince</hi> will be the glorious Author of the <hi>Britannique</hi> Liberty, as his Great Grandfather was of the <hi>Belgique.</hi> The <hi>Genoeſes</hi> to this day adore the Memory of <hi>Andrew Doria,</hi> who choſe rather to make them a <hi>Free State,</hi> than to be their <hi>Prince.</hi> Barely to change Our <hi>Maſter,</hi> would but revive the Feuds of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and involve us in the like Calamities.</p>
            <p>Theſe things to continue but during the Life of the <hi>King,</hi> and not to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice a Proteſtant Succeſſor.</p>
