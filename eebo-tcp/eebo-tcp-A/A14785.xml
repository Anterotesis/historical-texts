            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T had (Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull) no sooner entred my thought to handle some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, at the first, chiefly for mine own exercise, but that I found my selfe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto (vn-worthie though a Wrighters creadit) lesse suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for forme, then preuented of matter: for hardly discourse we that argument, whereof something before, to the like effect is not extant. As for the common text, Loue, I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed the same, especially by one man, so exquisitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notamized, that to others trauailing in the like, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft the flesh, muscles, veines, sinewes, blood, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, onely remaine the bones for their exercise: and to worke on so hard a subiect, were (thinke I) to be as vaine
<pb facs="tcp:3450:90"/>
as the Alchimist, who in seeking to perfit wonders for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, doth little else then worke himselfe a Begger, with cunning.</p>
            <p>In suspence therefore of such my purpose, I hapned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to place, where at one time to visite a sicke Gentleman, were assembled a Deuine, a Courtier, a Physition, a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, a Ciuilian, and a Countrie-man: euery of which bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying them selues about the sicke, had left in an out-ward Chamber somthing or other of their ordynarie Attire: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non entred the seuenth man a merrie conceyted Youth, who finding in one place such variety of Apparell, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally one after an other attyring him there withall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himselfe so formally, from the Pulpit to the Plough, from <hi>Paule</hi> his Epistles, to <hi>Ouid</hi> his <hi>de arte amandi, Galen</hi> his <hi>de sanitate tuenda, Littleton</hi> his Tenures, <hi>Justinean</hi> his <hi>Pandectes,</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> his <hi>Bugloges,</hi> that with no small de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to those present, he not only seemed the same in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance whom de did counterfect in action, but by those his merrimentes, did also minister to the weake gentleman such occasion of extraordinarie motion, and vio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that by the breaking of an Impostume he shortly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered.</p>
            <p>I then obseruing how these diuerse actions, thus deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by one Actor, wrought, because of varietie, to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectors a cause of mirth, and to the diseased a cure of his maladie, yet both comming by chaunce, emboldned my selfe in the like manner, though differing in the like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to huddle vp (rudely I feare) my following Medlie.</p>
            <p>The Patronage wherof most humbly I offer vnto your good Worship, with the same hope, which somtimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at <hi>Rome</hi> beyond hope to the poore Cobler, whose Crowe, not for <hi>Aue Caesar</hi> which to pronounce she was purposely taught, but for <hi>opera &amp; impensa periit,</hi> which came aptly and vnlooked for, was therefore accepted of <hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if nothing herein shall happen either profitable by
<pb facs="tcp:3450:90"/>
chance as it did to the sicke, or pleasant by chance as it did to <hi>Caesar,</hi> it will then lesse boote me to say my labour is lost with the Crow, then repent me of rashnesse as it once did an Ape, who somuch presumed of his furde iacket, that needes he would imitate the Beare to dispoyle the Bees of their honie: when, silie Ape (an adiect improper to an Ape, if not inuironed of Bees) no sooner had he touched the Hiue to haue tasted the honnie, but that the Bees were as nimble where they founde bare, as was Iacke at his ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet: putting him, to late, in remembraunce, that behinde he lay open to sightes, and naked to stinges.</p>
            <p>Yet (which best is) by so much the lesse feare I a rough Ayer, by how much the more I saile vnder a calme Lee, and he that intermedleth not in <hi>Tiresias</hi> his doome, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther awaketh <hi>Juno</hi> to him, neither needeth hee sleepe to <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Onely, if your Worship impute not this a presumption, that I hope after a good sentence, where I should feare a graue Censure, such tolleration may adde fresh Reedes to his Pipe, and he pipe otherwise to your prayse, that with no lesse affection then dutie, wisheth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto your Worship all happinesse, not preiudiciall to true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.</p>

               <p>At the length, sending the wind to be more fauourable, then their discouerie profitable, his purpose was to retire his men, and forthwith to haue wayed anker. But whilste he rested in this resolution, the <hi>Assirians</hi> might espie (des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending towards them from a mountaine) two men alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnweaponed and naked, sauing that their pined bodies were in some parts disorderly couered with a few vnhandsome rags: their lookes seemed wilde, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaunces full of heauinesse, their colour swarth, their heare and beardes long, lothsome, and vnkembde, and (to describe them in a word) being men in shape, they seemed monsters in show: but yet such monsters, as were rather to be pitied for their penurie, then to be feared for their crueltie.</p>

               <p>MOst happie people (to whom othewise I shoulde haue giuen a contrarie salutation, had not I des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried your ship, a friendly instrument to rid you out of so fruitlesse an Iland) I woulde not haue you imagine that wanting swordes to expell you, wee indeuour by words to cerrifie you. We are but twaine (as you see) and the only inhabitants of this vninhabitable Iland, yet twaine a greater number then that the plentie of this place is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to satisfie, not for that we are couetous desiring all, but miserable hauing nothing. Our foode is roots, grasse, and leaues, our lodging a Caue framed by nature out of the hard quarrie, our bed mosse, our apparell only such as you see, and the same the vnhappie spoiles of our haplesse companions: yet these are trifles in respect of a tragedie.</p>
               <p>And for that you haue partlye some experience of the place, though better cheape by all, then we that haue pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore to the vttermoste, I leaue you to iudge how it doth battell, by the view of our forlorne persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: saying in a word, that hell is no hell in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this, or that this is hell it selfe without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.</p>
               <p>In that we liue we are not vngratefull to the Gods, but in that we are not dead we account our selues vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate: for had death bene plyant to our petions, the end of our liues had bene long since the end of our sorrowes. But hope ouercomming dispaire, for that in the one is possibilitie, in the other no remedie, knowing that as the Gods haue power by iustice to punish, so they haue will by mercie to pardon, and considering that <hi>Fortune</hi> is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with two faces, frowning with the one, and smiling with the other, that winter doth bite but sommer burnish, we haue made necessitie a vertue, continuance a custome, and patience our protector.</p>

               <p>We will not feare to speake, though you spare not to strike, aboundaunce of hardnesse hath made vs hardie, the worst of your malice can be but death, and the best thing may betide vs, shall bee change of our liues. We are <hi>Meades,</hi> not monsters, ciuile people, not sauadge Ilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, banished from home through your prosperitie, and betrayed here through our owne practises, once flying your enmitie, and now following your friendship, as men enforced to the first by your wronges, and constrained to the later through our owne wretchednesse. With this courage neuerthelesse (ye <hi>Assirians</hi>) we sollicitate your fauour, that if the old rancour of your grudge, be not yet qualified with the newe spectacle of our present calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, our sides (know ye) haue not as yet taken so muche the propertie of these hard Rockes, but that they will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily giue entrance to your reuenging weapons. Albeit, by the way, it might be sayde, that as you are to deale roughly with those that stand against you in combate, so ought you to deale mercifullye with those which at your feete lie prustrate, for in the one your courage is not more magnificent, then in the other your charitie meritorious: and though it be glorious to ouercome by battell, yet is it more glorious to be ouercome by pittie. For (alas) shall men whom nature hath endued with reason, and vnited in originall amitie, by occasion of any corrupt accident, continue more malitious than vnreasonable or sencelesse creatures? Doth not the Plantane profit the toade in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdening her of the superfluitie of poyson? and the same neuerthelesse, stand vs in steede to many good purposes, or doth it derogate any thing from vertue, if by our indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie wee better the vitious? or shall wee cut of those limbes that are now sound, because the same were once sore?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3450:94"/>Well, if remembring what we haue bene, you wil not conceaue what we would be, if our humble submission be thought an insufficient reconciliation, if you feare vs that haue neither will nor power to harme you, if you wil not (which is the summe of our sute) deliuer vs from hence, that of our own accord are falne into your handes: if (I say) it be your pleasures that we shall not weepe for vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected kindnesse, whom you shall not enforce to dread for any practised torments, then assure your selues, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more tirannous, then we patient, and our death shall be more dishonourable to you, then our graues dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contenting to vs.</p>
               <p>The only thing we craue is to be conuaied out of this Iland, a small petition, and easily performed: the poizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of twaine will not be burdenous to your barke, and the hyer for our passage shall lighten your hartes.

Let it suffice, that the sillie soules were pitied, their pensiuenesse comforted, their bodies appareled, al former enmitie pardoned, and libertie promised.</p>
               <p>But see what an euill euent followed so good an hansel. In the night before the <hi>Assirians</hi> should depart, <hi>Sorares</hi> calling diuers the cheefe of his soldiors to suppe with him in his cabben, enuited amongst the rest the two <hi>Meades,</hi> and after supper ended, he intreated the miserable Duke to declare by what mishap they chanced into that harbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Iland, wherevpon <hi>Arbaces</hi> proceeded in this maner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3450:95"/>Albeit (good <hi>Sorares,</hi> and you the rest of our benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) the remembraunce of our passed sorrowes will bee little lesse then a present death to our spirits, the whiche without anguish we cannot rehearse, nor you without pittie heare, yet shall you not find vs daintie to aunswere your request, whom we haue found so forward to yield vs releefe.</p>
               <p>Aboue two hundred yeares of mine age are alreadie passed, a short time, if not lengthened out with continuall sorrowes, the roote therof chiefly springing from <hi>Assiria</hi>: and yet (good <hi>Sorares</hi>) thinke not that hauing cause to curse your countriemen that banished vs into this Iland, that therfore we will cease our prayers for you, by whom our deliuerie is promised, seeing why wee should malice you we can render no reason, but why we should honour you we haue good occasion.</p>
               <p>The purportie of this my speeche is to be construed to this purpose, that as we are not to accuse you for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued iniuries at the handes of your predicessors, so is it not necessarie that in malice you become their successors: for if we shall make their olde controuersies, our newe quarrels, it will followe, that first the worlde and all thinges shall cease to be, before strife and discorde shall cease to grow. But hitherto I haue bene rather tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to your eares, then aunswering to your demaundes, yet pardon my beginning, and with patience carrie an ende.</p>
               <p>It is a worlde to note the wondrous alteration of all thinges, euen of late dayes, for omitting to speake of the time before the generall deluge, I will onely glaunce at the superfluitie of this our present age.</p>
               <p>It hath bene, yea within the time of my remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, that men thought themselues more sure in their wilde Caues, then now safe in their walled Castles, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting themselues with the vnforced fruitfulnesse of the earth, then now satisfied with their fruitlesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
<pb facs="tcp:3450:95"/>
enforced by art, the simplicitie of nature prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto them an absolute law, but ouermuch curiositie now, subuerteth both law and nature. What speake I of part? when it is manifest that no sooner golde and siluer the Ambassadors from hell, had insinuated themselues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hartes of men, but that a generall subuertion was made of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nemroth</hi> then taking vpon him an vnknowne title, not euer heard of before in all the world, much lesse in <hi>Caldia,</hi> became a king in <hi>Babilon</hi>: who, by suttletie hauing wone the harts of the vnpollitick people, by that meanes got them vnder the yoke of seruitude. <hi>Nemroth</hi> being dead, his sonne <hi>Belus</hi> hunting after greater superioritie than was by his father newly exacted, pretended by warres to dilate his dominions, whose dreadfull purpose being by death made frustrate, his sonne <hi>Ninus,</hi> your late Emperor and our then persecutor, did execute. Making his new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of warre &amp; battell not only terrible to those that did taste it, but horrible to vs whiche as yet did not feele it.</p>
               <p>After a while it came to passe, that we who hetherto did only heare much mischiefe of warre reported, did now suffer the effects of that, which of long time we feared: for <hi>Ninus</hi> landing an armie of soldiours in <hi>Media,</hi> obtayned an easie victorie against vs bad warriours, and in respect of holdes, armour and artilerie, a people vtterlye na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninus</hi> being thus conqueror, &amp; we conquered, our king <hi>Farnus,</hi> his wife and vii. children murdered, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods of an vniuersal slaughter still appearing, &amp; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of the whole countrey being generally expected for, diuers Nobles of <hi>Media,</hi> and others not of the basest calling, to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of 100 &amp; vpwards, of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, &amp; the whole number now liuing we two are, hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed into a shippe the gold and cheefest treasure of our slaughtered king, and rather trusting to the incertaintie
<pb facs="tcp:3450:96"/>
of the seas, then to the inhumanitie of the <hi>Assirian</hi> sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors, in an vnluckie hower hoisted vp our sailes, leauing with teares our wasted countrey, as men compelled to search after some new habitation.</p>
               <p>The seas we passed were numberlesse, the sorrowes we suffred were greeuous, the daungers we escaped were perilous, how farre we had sayled we account not, howe farre we should saile, we knew not, where to ariue wee were ignoraunt, and all places (if farre enough from the <hi>Assirians</hi>) seemed to vs indifferent.</p>
               <p>In the end, being no lesse vnfortunate in our seafaring, then vnexpert in the new art of nauigation, seing our vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels to waste, our vessel to leake, and our tackling to faile, such was then our comfortlesse dispaire, that hauing no hope at all to escape the threatning waues, it did only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke vs that we forsooke our natural graues, in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue countrie, to finish our liues without honour amongst the mercilesse surges. But corke wanteth waite to sinke, and lead is ouer heauie to swimme, we were not so happy as to suffer shipwrack on the seas, being predestinate to sorrowes on the shoare.</p>
               <p>At the length we espied this Ilande, and making to the same, nere about the place wher this ship now rideth, we stroke saile: and (vnhappie men) so ioyfull to vs see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this our ariuall, that then promising to our selues securitie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we did but newly enter into our sorrowes, we leapt from out our ship, with mindes neuer to reenter the same, kissing the very earth that first receaued vs a shore: this hapned about mid-day, but before night, our mirth was thus turned to mone.</p>
               <p>Not hauing, as yet, made any sacrifice to the Gods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore search of the profit, or disprofit of the place, any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration care or forecast of afterclaps whatsoeuer, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to vnfraught our ship, laying our gold and treasure on the next shoar. Scarcely had the last man brought the last burthen from the ship, but that a contention fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb facs="tcp:3450:96"/>
two of the noble men (seuerally before time noted of Ambition and Auarice) about the diuision of the same treasure. And such was their madnesse, that albeit their present plight rather required lowly teares, than haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie titles, yet Ambition not yeelding an ynch to Auarice, either of them sought by farre discentes to fetch their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigrees from <hi>Iapeth</hi> and <hi>Madus,</hi> of whom we are the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, as nere as possibly they might.</p>
               <p>Amongst the inferior sort, there was one <hi>Chebron,</hi> a lustie taule fellow, of a hote cholericke complexion, and an inuincible courage: he seeing the controuersie, that now began more &amp; more to encrease, bending his browes and laying hand on his weapon, spake many words much displeasing to either of the contentious compettitours. And were it not <hi>(Sorares)</hi> that I shoulde cloy your eares with ouer lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g a discourse, I would also repeat his words, the which I yet remember, as (in my conceit) wel worthy the noting.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Sorares</hi> interrupting him sayd: If (good my friend) it shal not be troublesome for you to speake, it shal not be tedious for vs to heare, our dayes worke is done, and it is yet but early nights, let those that will sleepe, as for my selfe I am prouided to wake.</p>
               <p>And were I also able (qd. <hi>Arbaces</hi>) to counterfeite the magnanimitie that then appeared in his countinaunce, I would not willingly pretermit the same, but these were the words that <hi>Chebron</hi> then vsed.</p>

               <p>If beggers thus set on horsebacke ride a galop, let vs then make accompt, that these claiming by gentry will ply the spurre. Briefly what can I say more, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in effect is already experienced? see you not or are you willingly blinde? how these two gallants onely remembring what they sometime were but not acknowledging what they presently be, make no question of our safety, but fall to quarrels for their priuate superiority: not considering y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fire once squenched forgoeth both heate &amp; brightnes, that grasse once mowed, looseth both sap and greenes, &amp; that a noble man exiled, if not of noble birth, yet of authority and honorable estimation standeth disgraded.</p>
               <p>But let it be that banishment is no dispargement to birth, yet should we for our own assurance, respect the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell, &amp; haue an eie to their inclinations whom we admit to rule.

But such as are these our high minded intrudors (whom we may therefore call ignoble, because not vertuous, as hauing already dashed at home against the rockes of ignomie, and now here entred into vtter shipwracke of the small remaine of their credit,) these I say chaleng preeminence not for desertes, but of duty: exacting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of vs through ambition, which they can neither discreatly discharge, nor we dangerles dispose: &amp; yet like as violent waters are prone to often eruptions, beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming shallowest within their ordinary channels, so proud persons are euermore capable of higher dignities,
<pb facs="tcp:3450:98"/>
though not wel able, to excercise their present meane offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: stil doth the proud man flatter himself in that that he would, not esteeming of himself in any point as he ought.</p>
               <p>There is hardly that thing so good, but there may be a better, or that thing so bad, but there may be a worser: the wilde oliue is sauerie, but the ripe figge is sweeter, the Tiger mangleth with her teeth, but the Baselique mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth with her eye: there is no beautie without some blemish, nor any blemish that is not either naturall, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie: no perfection with some imperfection, and yet the same imperfection either to be cured, or tollerable: only Ambition, vntill of it own selfe it be deuoured, is bloodlesse for blushing, and intractable for taming, penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie doth not decrease it, and plentie doth increase it, in wel doing it is insolent, in ill doing impudent.</p>
               <p>As for the other monster Auerise, a little varying from Ambition in qualitie of affection, but not in quantitie of affecting, this (I say) is still hunting, but euermore hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering, still praying, but continually pining, stil getting but neuer gaining, and still hoording, but neuer hauing. For as the hollow spoute receaueth much water, and yet retaineth nothing but ayre, so the couetous man gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth much wealth, and yet possesseth nothing but cares, and only he of all monsters, in his rauenous deuouring is vnsatiable: for whereas commonly all other vices by old age are impaired, his only vice is theerby repaired, the nerenesse of the graue the rather adding to nigardise.</p>
               <p>O most miserable man, to whome is wanting as well that which he possesseth, as that which he wanteth, hee hungereth after that which he coueteth, and feareth to lose that which he emoyeth, and as in aduersitie he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth prosperitie, so in prosperitie he feareth aduersitie, in his superior he dreadeth force, in his inferiour he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

harmefull to a couetous man, then long life. And (trust me) if we consider with what toile wealth is got, with what danger it is kept, what charmes in vsing it, what detriment in abusing it, and with what anguish we leaue it, then shall we find more profite in pouertie, then quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in riches.</p>
               <p>One thing it is to be happie, and an other to bee riche<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but detestable is the exchange, when to follow golde wee forsake the Gods: as no doubt doth the couetous man, of whom what should I more say? but that his life is dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of many, his death desired of all, and being dead, the poore man curseth, his heire reioyceth, the saints weepe, and the diuels laugh.</p>
               <p>How harmeful (ye <hi>Meades</hi>) these two monsters haue bene, all the world hath found, we haue felt, and more shal feele, except being yet but yong Snakes, they be cut off, before they grow to be old Serpents.</p>
               <p>If these two iollie Champions had bene well counce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and not so couitous, or more pollitick, and lesse proud: then this vnnecessarie strife shoulde haue bene the last thing of a thousand, for our behoofes much more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: Neither would they haue perswaded themselues to be Kinges not being assured of subiects, nor haue conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a kingdome, not hauing conquered an Iland.</p>
               <p>Alas how much more vnfortunate are we in transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these reliques of gentrie, and small remnant of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure into <hi>Scithia,</hi> then in leauing the blood of our friends, and masses of wealth behind vs in <hi>Media.</hi>

But by this meanes those that woulde thus haue fledde, were now enforced to take a part in our ciuil fight.</p>
               <p>Still perseuer we in mangling and murthering one an other, vntill <hi>Chebron</hi> and his adherentes had vtterly confounded the aduerse party, and that of an hundred men and more that ariued here, within fiue or sixe howers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly xvi. remained vnslaine, yet we (though so small a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But what dwell I longer on this mischiefe, the matter being much more dolorous that resteth yet vnresited.</p>
               <p>When our handes were thus ouersoone filled with blood, &amp; that our eyes had ouer late emptied their teares, although our sore limmes require rest, yet our sharpe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites hunger for foode: and therefore as well pricked forwards by hunger, as desirous to be instructed what a

profitable plot we had picked out for our here abode, wee discouered into the farthest circuit of this Iland. But the same seemed abhorred of the gods, and we found it vtterly abandoned of men, beastes, fowles, fruites, and euery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing necessarie for mans behoofe: and (worser then so) we being shiplesse, and on euery side with main Seas enuironed, did also remain hopelesse of our deliuerie from hence.</p>
               <p>Now in this melancholie, euery man laid violent hand vpon <hi>Chebron,</hi> fathering our woes vpon his late inuec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue wordes, whereby (in my conceit) hee rather intented quietnesse than pretended any suche quarrels: howbeit our mutinous minds altered with the time and troubles, made a newe construction of his zealous meaning, and doe what he could, we pressed him to death vnder an huge heape of golde, whose bones vnder the pile are yet extant.</p>
               <p>After this, some of our companie not able to abide the extremitie of this climate, the stench of the ayre, and stiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of the Iland, by mutuall consents, made mutuall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of their own persons, and shortly after vntimelye death finished the liues of the residue, who being far more fortunate in dying, then wee in suruiuing, lefte onelye vs two the vnhappy inheritours of these vnspeakeable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</p>

               <p>But vnceasable are the mischiefes that golde procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and vnsatiable are the mindes of couetous men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sorares</hi> being thus spead of this bootie, and hauing consulted with his countrimen of a further inquisition, began now to exact at the handes of the poore <hi>Meades</hi> a greater pray then wherein they coulde satisfie their aue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, hunting after that whiche was not there to bee had, and (seeking as it were) to extort fire out of water, they would not be perswaded, but the guiltlesse soules had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued vnto themselues some greater treasure: denyall might not acquite them, nor intreaty saue them from tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: so that hauing already passed some, to them were threatned other greater except they would promise, what (poore wretches) they could not performe.</p>
               <p>But in the end, this diuilish deuise of the <hi>Assirians</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened their owne detrament: who thus dreaming of hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den treasure, for searth thereof, had scattered themselues, without any one man remaining aboorde into euerye cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Iland.

but thrise both hearte, and hande fainted and failed in performance thereof.</p>
               <p>In the ende casting downe my partiall weapon, and withdrawing my selfe into an other chamber, after that I had a good while deliberated of the matter, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childishly lamented the manner, I resolued vpon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, that is, that the miserable woman shoulde still liue, detesting neuerthelesse vtterly to dispence with her lewdnesse: and therefore for punishment I enioyned her this pennance, neuer to tast any other sustinance, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till time she hath buried within her owne bowels, the whole carcasse of her lybidanous parramour.</p>
               <p>This pennance in my displeasure haue I vnaduisedly vowed, and this vowe at more leasure haue I repented, for the suffring is not greater to her, then the sight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of greeuous to me: and were it so (what shall it aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage me to dissemble) that I coulde without offence, absolue my selfe of the vowe I haue taken, I woulde most willingly dissolue her from the woes shee tasteth: but forasmuch as vowes made to the gods, are not to bee reuoked at the discretion of men, I esteeme it better, that shee by correction become hereafter pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, then that I by infringing my oathe, and shee by escaping vnpunished, become either of vs repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Scythian</hi> Lorde with wet cheekes finished his tale, and <hi>Atys</hi> and <hi>Abynados</hi> were freed of further dread, though not a little grieued of so amiable a Ladie her infelicitie.</p>

               <p>Thou also giuest out, that they must worship new gods, and forsake their old religion, but I say that wise trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers passe by safe-conduct, &amp; amongst their league friends, are from those matters exempted, either keepimg aloofe from where they doubt in these things to be sifted, or else being there rashly or violently ariued, matters maye bee auoided with such discretion, that without preiudice to their gods, or offence to their owne consciences, they may reuerently pray in a strange temple, to their known god whose altars are absent, and yet doe no reuerence at all to the vnknown god whose Image is present: for though there be necessitie that they kneele by the shrine, yet is it not necessarie that they kisse the Saint: in zeale, not in shewe consisteth deuotion, and a speedye returne is in suche cace the surest resistaunce: or if sifted beyond gods-forbod, then a godlye martyrdome is a glorious enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>As for the sundry vices frequented in those countreys, by thee seuerally named, my aunswere is, that out of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shelles we haue sweete kernels, that in one and the same place, are had presidents both of vice and vertue, and one and the same man may be holpen or hindered by eyther example: the well disposed Trauailer doth learn to immitate in the good their commendable qualities, and to abhorre in the badd their condemnable maners, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both presidents, good, &amp; bad, to one vertuous purpose.</p>

               <p>Nay, qd. the Pilot (vndertaking to bee a stickler in the strife) no more of this matter, ynough is as good as a feast, and too much of one thing, is good for nothing: here is a businesse (in deede) as if all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>WEre it so (my euermore couragious, but now comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) that we once again were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion fields of <hi>India,</hi> enclosed with the warlike bands of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis</hi> though fiue times doubled, yet would I put you in hope either to march after them in a second pursuite, or at the least to make from them the first escape: but (alas) small is the councel that I am now able to giue, yet som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the comfort that therby you may gaine, but no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest at al is here to be got, knowing that to intreate, or threaten the churlish surges, were more than Follie.</p>
               <p>Onely giue me leaue in this my last, I say my last and vnaccustomed exhortation, to preuaile, and then assure
<pb facs="tcp:3450:30"/>
your selues, that if this aged carcase of mine sufficiently instructed not to feare death, to be solde into perpetuall bondage, or to suffer death it selfe might be in ought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileable to you, I would account such bondage a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and such death a flea-biting: for how I haue bene, &amp; am affectioned towards you, may well appeare in this, that I a Duke by birth, and your General by assignme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, was notwithstanding the first, before the meanest here that did want to eate, &amp; not the last of this company that did feele the famine: and yet were you eased of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, I should not be impatient of much more sorrowe.</p>
               <p>Listen therefore I say, how I your careful Captaine, not occasioned nowe (as often times heretofore) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct you how and in what manner you ought to fight, am at this time (after a far differing sort) to admonishe you, how and in what manner you are to die.</p>
               <p>It either needes not, or bootes not, to be offended with Fortune, that can be no other then mutable by name and nature, neither is Fortune, whom it pleaseth the irreligious people to intitle a blinde Goddesse, any other in deede, then a by-name drawne from the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and Euents of our mortall actions: but it is the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted gods the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues whom we haue by some meanes vnaduisedly offended, it is they that punish, and them must we pacifie, as those of whose aide we should neuer dispaire: for though persecution procureth a death to the bodie, yet a conscience dispairing assureth death to the soule: miserable is distresse, more miserable distrust, but most miserable then to feare, when we cannot hope.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, let vs not make our case so desperate, but that (whatsoeuer shall betyde vs, life or death) we laie hold-fast on patience, the onely touch-stone of vertue, being pleasure vnto paine, comfort to correction, wealth vnto want, and death vnto death, vanquishing altogether with suffring and not with striuing, then which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more victorious, no not death it selfe: for who are
<pb facs="tcp:3450:31"/>
those that death conquereth? euen such fooles as dreade him, and vnto whom the onely remembraunce of death is an horrour, such (I say) as willingly become Ghostes, whilst they feare their graues, fearing more in sence then they may feele in substance, and not thinking their paine will be either not great, or not long.</p>
               <p>What shoulde be the cause, that men hauing Nature their vndoubted Author, Reason their assure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Instructor, &amp; Experience their continuall Perswader, should neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles or euer death commeth, little better then die through the onely feare they conceiue of death? vnles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to much on their wealth, which they are loth to leaue, or else hoping to little of the mercifull gods, who then forgiue an ill life, when they find a good ende: with whom it shalbe neuer to late too shake ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, as esteeming whatsoeuer is done wel enough, to be done soone ynough.</p>
               <p>Yea the rather (my louing companions) haue we no cause to dreade death, or wish life, that are to die at the appointment of the gods, and not by the iudgement of men: for to the Person worthely condemned, death is a double death, it being farre more miserable to deserue it, then to suffer it: and yet though it be in the power of men, to iudge men, (which I also thinke to happen but at sufferance of the gods) Nature doth assure death vnto al, not graunting to any one his life by pattent, but at pleasure: and that in such sorte, that not the wysest man lyuing can say, there, then, or thus I shall die, and yet sure he is that die he shall.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore (my good friendes) that death is so certaine, as nothing more sure, and the order of his comming so vnsure, as nothing lesse certaine, and that an honest death is the goale of our liues, howe happie are we (if we could conceiue of our happinesse) that shall die with such fauourable opportunitie of repentance? well deseruing of our countrie, lamented for of our friendes, not laughed at of our fooes, yea then when life is yrke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

some vnto vs: &amp; that not on Ieobets, as do Malefactors: not in Prisons, as doe Captiues: not in Corners, as doe Cowardes: not in Quarrels, as doe Cutters: not in Chaines, in our enemies Triumphes: neither yet sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, then which no death is more dreadfull: but in a ship which doth argue vs venterous: in the Seas, not to be subdued by Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querours: in our Prince his affaires, as loyall subiectes: with famine, which confoundeth Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: with fame of former prowesse, and by prayer, which shall reuiue vs.</p>
               <p>What can we wish more of the gods, or what should I say more to you, whose deliuerie is not desperat, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to sence vnpossible, and vnto whom (forlorne Soules) death the ende of all wretchednesse, ought especialy to be welcome? Certes no more remaineth, but to intreate you (whom henceforth I shall neuer more exhort) to be patient without grudging, penitent without wauering, prepared without dispayring, dying to the flesh, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to your soules, yea lastly, remember I beseech you, that we are no sooner borne into the worlde, but that wee liue to die from the world, &amp; therfore ought rather to loue whether we must necessarily, then from whence we must of necessitie. Thus not able to comfort you as I woulde, but willingly to counsell you as I may, no more resteth but that I wish the continuance of so grieuous a life, to haue deliueraunce by a godly death.</p>
               <p>This said, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble Duke turneth his face, &amp; we might perceiue how the teares trilled down his cheeks: at sight wherof, we that did alwaies reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce him for his Graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, obay him for his Authority, loue him for his Lenity, &amp; honour him for his Liberality, could not but for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie weepe.</p>

               <p>Diuerse dayes were past, &amp; diuerse Martyred soules had performed this harde Composition: in the ende the lot fell to me, so that die I shoulde, and (in good sooth) die I would, neither did any of vs all desire to haue liued: being perswaded either to perish (and that shortly) in the drenching waues, or by this casuall crueltie, or else in the ende by famine: and (which was not the least of our griefes) who could willingly abide, to see the butchered bodies of their deare friendes, before their eyes, &amp; whilst the flesh yet panted, to be mangled into smale gobbits, &amp; dealt about the blooddie ship for the others to feede vpon? So that therfore, with greater patience then I now liue I then prepared to die, mine hungry companions in the meane while, as eagarly whetting their stomackes on their teath.</p>

               <p>BUt what is it that time doth not determine, or at least wise diminish? diuers yeares after (he yet continuing a broken batchiler) when his pensiuenes was grown from a wound to a skarre, he ariued at <hi>Cicyona,</hi> there familiarly to visite his old friend, and brother in law that might haue bene King <hi>Selchim,</hi> who gladly gaue him entertainment answerable to his magnificence.</p>
               <p>During the time of <hi>Staurobates</hi> his now abode in <hi>Cicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ona, Marpissa</hi> King <hi>Selchim</hi> his only daughter and heire, a perfit blossome of beautie, a matchlesse Parago<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, perfected by Nature, and pullished by Nurture, and one whome Enuie it selfe could not in any wise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach, occcupied so great a portion of now more hers than his own hart, that <hi>Pheone</hi> was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diszeased, but <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pissa</hi> seazed, the Aunt dismissed, but the Niece admitted, the one lacked, but the other loued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Staurobates</hi> therefore, firste mouing <hi>Selchim</hi> of this match, and there preuailing, did secondlye make loue to <hi>Marpissa,</hi> but there fayled: howbeit like a wilie wenche, she finely smootheth him off with such delatorie answers, that cunningly she leaueth her selfe at liberty, and giueth to him neuerthelesse cause to play on the bridle, for hee assured himselfe of nothing more, than that he had gotten a wife, when she perswaded herselfe of nothing lesse, then to take him for husband.</p>
               <p>There was at that time in the Court, attendaunt vpon a young Duke, which Duke had bene, in vaine, a long su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Princesse, one <hi>Crisippus,</hi> knowne to be no other than a ritche Marchants sonne of the same Citie where the Court than lay, but yet a youthful Gallant, and a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Courtier: he at the commaundement, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Duke his maister, vsed often repaire to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pissa,</hi> and had much conference with her as touching the
<pb facs="tcp:3450:36"/>
same Duke his loue. But shee careleslye neglecting the curteous proffers of the master, did contemplatiuely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the comly personage of the man, who being scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly xviii. winters old, both for actiuitie, maners, and well making, was (at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> least wise in her eye) not second to any.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Crisippus,</hi> I say, this affiansed factor, &amp; fauoured Soliciter, was the only sleping <hi>Endimion</hi> secretly kissed of <hi>Phoebe,</hi> &amp; (so far-forth as her loue wanting a second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, might extend it selfe) to <hi>Galatea</hi> an <hi>Acis,</hi> to <hi>Venus</hi> an <hi>Adonis,</hi> and to <hi>Marpissa</hi> the first of her loue, or the last of her life. Wherfore after that she had with earnest &amp; long endeuour sought to resist vndesistable loue, at the length taking courage boldly to persist, she entreth with her-self into these Arguments: What reason hast thou <hi>(Marpissa)</hi> to contend with Loue, that is both restlesse and vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, adding so to fire fewell? or what standest thou vppon these ouer-curious points, thy fathers displeasure, <hi>Crisip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> his Pettigree, or thine own Modestie? when the first may be pacified, or else by meanes auoided, for from whom we are deriued by birth, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what can we more returne than reuerent mindes? but to whome wee are driuen by loue, from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what may we lesse with-hold than our own parso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? yea <hi>Marpissa</hi> thou maist also reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and loue as a wife, and yet the later not preiudicial to the first. Secondly, and as concerning <hi>Crisippus</hi> his Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigree, or Pouertie, what is that to be respected? seeing thou doest delight in his parsonage, not descant of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage, whose vertue doth counteruaile the want of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: for better the man lacking wealth, then wealth lacking the man. Thirdly, what shouldest thou bee more nise than wise? that art therefore to be pardoned because in loue, and who is ignorant that loue respecteth no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? for howsoeuer in all other things hapneth a superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oritie, yet Nature that hath giuen to vs alone Birth, one Breath, and one Death, in this one only thing remaineth vncorrupt, and is to all alike indifferent, making <hi>Phoebus</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:3450:37"/>
a Sheapheard, and <hi>Hercules</hi> a Cot-queane: but admit the Discord, yet mariage maketh the Concord.</p>
               <p>Mariage (qd. I) yea but all the craft in catching, and cunning in keeping: I marie <hi>Marpissa,</hi> this was sweetly spoken if faire words might win him, but <hi>Crisippus</hi> is no Pigeon to be taken with a beane, nor a child to be intised with a Ball, he may be perhaps a Louer, but not loue for losse, and will more esteeme a dowrie that is bountifull, than a Kings Daughter though beautifull. Alas <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pissa,</hi> what dowrie canst thou bring him? Ah, Death, if he be taken: Banishment, if he escape: and Pouertie, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he speedeth? Wherfore if thou wilt loue him, then leane to loue him, but that (alas) will neuer be, except thou also leaue to liue. Nay, rather moue the question, and afterwards dispose of thy selfe according to his answere: they are more than miserable, that seeke a sword to perish on the point, before a salue to applie to their paine: the vexed parson that in most anguish, crieth out to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of greefe, the same would not with the least violence, be then dispatched of life: speake <hi>Marpissa</hi> nowe, or else neuer speede, sue to him for loue, that perhaps would, but feares to attempt thee in the like: thou shalt, no doubt, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he is neither discurteous, nor timerous, &amp; so consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a Partner shal the rather make him venterous of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill.</p>

               <p>JT is moreouer to be noted, that Nature whom we must graunt to be perfit in all her Actions, foreseeing that without the helpe of women, the depopulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world woulde follow, to the intent therefore that men should be the more capable of their Imbracementes, hath infused throughout the whole linaments of their delicate bodies, and sweete faces such aboundance of beautie, that we see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the excellencie of the same, to shine in our eyes like precious Carbuncles, hoisting vp the sayles of our hope, and drawing neere vnto them in the Ships of our hartes, become after many pleasant perils, first Marchantes, &amp; then Maisters of such inualuable Iewels: though not at all times, with such speede as we woulde, yet with a more profitable sute then wee wish: without crossing is no cowning, by the labour some acquiring of women, wee are, say I, not a little profited in valour, and wisedome: for when they haue thus set our teeth amorously on edge, it standeth vs vppon artificially to whet our wittes: that our tongues hunt for eloquence in presence to delight, and our heades for inuentions, in absence to deserue: in our dealings we then must be circumspect, in diet temperate, and in apparell desent, with all which loue doth furnishe vs, and by all which loue is furthered. Adde also hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that their loue teacheth vs to be valiant in Chiualrie, and venterous in Armes, to thinke feare a fault, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing impossible, to exercise all things, to enterprise most thinges, and in somewhat to be exquisite.</p>
               <p>Nay be it so (which may be denied) that by wooing we are losers, yet doth it follow (which all must confesse) that by wining we are gainers: who attaining at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length to be possessours of our couited prises, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand in triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phwise our subdued Troubles, to follow like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> chained Captiues our victorious Chariots, yea and by how much greeuous

               <p>That the gods them selues, were the first Institutors of Marriage it is probable, that therby our fleshly Appetits be not only qualified with a more ciuil Coiture, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might seeme brutish and offensiue to nature, but also the worlde multyplied with a legitimate, no bastardly Propagation must be graunted: but (which is more) marriage, no doubt, being a thing miraculously confirmed, through a mutuall partisipation of whatsoeuer they possesse, and free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitie of their own persons, being as I may terme it, by Transplantation two in one flesh, worketh one &amp; the same will, wish, loue, liking, or disliking, affection, defection, &amp; affliction betwixt the man, &amp; woman coupled in Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially the wife, by a more inscrutable, pliant, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous &amp; profound forwardnesse in Consent is at all assaies, &amp; in all things flexable to the nature, conditions, dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will and estate of her huband: in prosperitie a partner of his wealth, in aduersitie a partaker of his woe, and in both a comfortable companion: in health she filleth him with delightfull sollace, in sicknesse shee followeth him with duetifull succour, and in all things is a constant cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Ah sweet Ladies, no longer would I liue than I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you, but sooner would I die than I shall hate you: otherwise old age, should draw my head to ioyne with my feete, and a loathed life make mee glad with my nailes to scrape mine owne graue, and neuerthelesse still to liue in sorrow, rather than to die a Recreant in your seruice: and that I speake this for fashion, or flatterie, or that I grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d mine opinion vpon an vnperfect foundation let not any i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine: for Nature it selfe by an vnrepelable lawe, doth inioine vs to your loue, and amongest men by a lawdable custome, your honouring, hallowing, reuerensing, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting is especially prouided for.</p>

               <p>I am (deare father) inioyned an ouer greeuous pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that being patiently resolued vpon a simple death, doe now also by your impatience liue a dying life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by my death is rather doubled than deferred: but (which is more, and which is worse) must I alas, in this extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, must I hunt for comfortable sayinges to appease your discouraging sorrowes? You are not I knowe aduised howe you enuie my good happe, because not aduertised how you hinder my sweete hope, whiche hope is death, and Death the Salue for all sorrowes, and the Deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the immortall Soule from the Prison of this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall

bodie: neither is it the ill Death but the well dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wee are to account of: for not the stifling Halter of Hempe, or sinking pillow of downe, doe in any thing help or hinder our passage to Heauen.</p>
               <p>Bee not greeued in that youre Sonne is punished, but bee gladde in that hee hath not deserued suche pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishmente: were I guiltie, perhaps my death should disquiet you the lesse, when in that I am innocente you ought to bee quieted the more: as Nature doeth moue you to lamente the death of your Sonne, so let reason learne you the qualitie of your Seede whiche is mortall: if because I am young you wishe my life mighte bee prolonged, I aunswere in not dying olde my Sorrowes are abridged: if you can-not (as perhappes you doe not) disgest the bloodye Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe of your dishonourable Enemie, than doe not (as no doubte you doe) double his Ambition, with the bootelesse expence of your ouer humble petitions: for thinke not that this Tyraunte, who can not leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then his owne dayes one momente, canne of himselfe shorten my date one minute, but that the Gods (for so I hope) readie to accept of my soule, haue made him an instrument to separate it from the body.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (good Father) seeing that death is both necessarie, and also ouertaketh vs all of necessitie, seeing I auarre the one by triall, neyther maye you auoyde the other by trauarse, with the reuerente duetie of a Sonne I require it, and withoute the partiall affection of a Father I beseeche you to graunt it, that youre im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience maye not driue those bloodie teares to my harte, whiche (not with a desperate minde I speake it) this butcherlye penaunce shall neuer drawe from mine eyes.</p>

I know thy courage is haughtie, and my quarrell ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, be therefore venterous in this, as thou art valiant in all thinges else, and condiscente to ioyne in so knight-like a Combate, with so indifferent a Combattant, who ouercomming, or being my selfe ouercommed do assure thee of this comfort, that thy selfe art the last man shall see me lyuing: the reason hereof (if thou seekest a reason) is, the soule of <hi>Xenarchus</hi> at once laboureth to salute the ghost of <hi>Tymaetes,</hi> an withall to keepe an Obbit to him with thy life, by whose only meanes his death was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted, and against whom his blood cryeth vengeance.</p>
               <p>To excuse my selfe (replyed <hi>Mazeres</hi>) by loue, were to accuse loue of homiside, to argue against such your friendship, were the rather to agrauate your enmitie, and to denie the chalenge, were to distrust mine owne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, so that in excusing I should accuse as I will not, in

               <p>Now when <hi>Xenarchus</hi> would admit no excuses, others then by Combate to discide the discorde, the two knights so valiantly giue the charge ech on the other, that whilst both strike, both seeme rather to shrinke with the blowes then to shun the weapons, either of them shewed enough of courage, neither of them were to seeke of cunning, and fret more with scorne to be wounded, then feele the smart of their woundes.</p>

seeking, in that his madnesse, for weapons whereon to perish.</p>
               <p>Whereof being preuented, and shut vp safe (as they thought) in his Chamber, the Tyrant impacient of life, when all other meanes failed, swallowed down his throte red burning Coales: &amp; after he had languished certaine dayes in horrible anguish, dyed to the contentment of the most or all, that liued to the comfort of a few or none.</p>

               <p>Father (qd. he) mine owne experience teacheth mee, that the Countrie is ouercombersome for vs that bee Courtiors, and thy presence in this place showeth that the Courte is ouercurious to you that be Countrie-men: howbeit let not our Courtlie statelinesse, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count conuenient for the place, out-dashe thy Countrie bluntnesse, which we esteeme kindely to the person: but if thou hast anie thing to say, let me then vnderstand who hath wronged thy right, that can, and will vndertake to right thy wrong.</p>
               <p>When the king with this encouragement, had set the poore-mans tongue at libertie, <hi>Philargus</hi> (for so was hee called) framed his complaint in this order.</p>

But in trifling the time in thus speaking of the bastard pride of these base braue Fellowes, being (in deed) but Waspes in comparison of Bees who though they buze fearefully, render sometimes honny, I may seeme in friuilous by-matters prolirious to your Maiesty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Thus (may it please your Maiestie) when all were tried, and I was tired, and that they lacked pitie, and I likely to perish, I was by good happe aduertised by some that spake as they spead, to appeale from those officious persons, or adiourning Maiestrates that heare not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hire, to the Court and Nobility there who heare such Sutors with more expedition, and helpe them with lesse expences.</p>

               <p>Now whether it were, that despaire to regaine the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state he lately had forgon made him resolute, or feare to goe farther and speede worser, diligent, or that necessitie made him vertuous being naturally vitious, I know not, but this I found, that shortly he setled himselfe with such towardnesse to our countrie Affaires, and homely fare, that the best husband-man was not more cunning at his worke, nor the worst Hine lesse choise of his meat: so that finding him more diligent than a Seruaunt, and no lesse dutifull than a Sonne, by the one I receiued commoditie, in the other I conceiued comfort: such was poore <hi>Ophel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> who then did not shame to be my seruaunt, but suche
<pb facs="tcp:3450:68"/>
is not prosperous <hi>Opheltes</hi> that now doth skorne to be my sonne in law. And yet, though his present Honour hath altered his former honestie, this is the man, and the selfe same <hi>Opheltes,</hi> vnto whome not hauing a Coate to his backe, Coyne in his purse, Foode for his belly, or Couer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for his head, I gaue both Apparell, Monie, Meate, and Harbour.</p>
               <p>And more than so, I haue, or rather, I feare me, I had but one only Childe a Daughter, whome <hi>Opheltes</hi> long wooed, at length wone, and with my consent did wedde: howbeit, wretched Wenche, many a lustie Youth, and riche Francklines sonne in seeking her beautie (such as it was) togethers with her inexorable loue, lost their vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded labour: only <hi>Opheltes</hi> had the happe to make her an vnhappie Wife.

Fable of the Asse, who carrying on his backe the Image of <hi>Isis,</hi> and seeing the people to fall downe and worship, forgetting his holy burden supposed himselfe to be so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and therefore in a brauerie began to yerke out at his Driuer, because as the rest he did not reuerence: but by that time his Maister had wel cudgeled his hide, the foolish Asse could then remember that to <hi>Isis,</hi> not to an Asse such honours appartained: euen so <hi>(Opheltes)</hi> thou that doest carie the Image, but not the Saint, the Uisour of honour, but not the vertues of honour, to rebate from thy vainglorious conceit in carying of honorable Titles, art by greeuous correction with the Asse to be taught, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Titles without verteous Conditions are but as Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, in respect of the Persons.

               <p>Could <hi>Philargus</hi> whom thou hast made poore with thy wrongs, poison thee with his words? or was his sight to thee a Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by whom thy self wert adopted a Sonne?
