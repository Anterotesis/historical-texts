            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>'Tis too evident how <hi>just</hi> this is in the application to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Age; <hi>Superstitions</hi> fondness, and fears are a <hi>real</hi> degree of <hi>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>

                        <p>(V.) It inclines men to reckon (as was intimated before) that the <hi>Essential Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> lye in the <hi>plain, certain</hi> Articles. For Philosophers are disposed to think, by converse with Nature, that <hi>certainty</hi> is in very <hi>few</hi> things; and whoever believes so concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tenents of <hi>Theology,</hi> will not lay the main stress upon <hi>any,</hi> but the <hi>clear,</hi> acknowledg'd Principles; and he that doth <hi>that,</hi> serves all the <hi>important</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Religion.</hi> He will not not <hi>wrangle</hi> for every <hi>conceit;</hi> nor <hi>divide</hi> for every <hi>difference;</hi> but takes care to walk in the ways of <hi>Charity, Humble Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Conscionable</hi> practice of the <hi>Truths</hi> he <hi>knows</hi> and <hi>owns.</hi> By such a course the <hi>Church</hi> is safe, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53395:50"/>
                           <hi>Schisms</hi> are prevented: Yea <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> is disappointed by it in most of the considerable things it hath to say; which indeed arise from the consideration of the vast <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities</hi> of <hi>opinions</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> that seem to infer the necessity of a <hi>Judge of Controversies</hi> to setle mens minds in the right way, and to rectifie the consequent disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; whereas if <hi>this</hi> be stood to, That <hi>the necessary Christian Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are plain, and acknowledg'd,</hi> There will be no <hi>need</hi> of a <hi>Judge,</hi> and so all the most <hi>specious</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> sink to the ground.</p>
                        <p>(VI.) The <hi>Real Philosophy</hi> tends to the ending of <hi>disputes,</hi> by taking men off from <hi>unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Terms</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> which very often are occasions of great contests:

If things were stated in <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>plain</hi> words, many Controversies would be at an end; and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy I am recommending, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines men to <hi>define</hi> with <hi>those</hi> that are <hi>simplest</hi> and <hi>plainest,</hi> and thereby also very much p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
                     <p>THus we see upon the whole, That there is no shadow of Reason why we should <hi>discourage,</hi> or <hi>oppose modest</hi> inquiries into the <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> and whatsoever <hi>ignorant</hi> zeal may prompt the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> sort to, methinks those of <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous</hi> education should not be of so <hi>perverse</hi> a frame. Especially it becomes not any that <hi>minister</hi> at the <hi>Altar,</hi> to do so great a <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service</hi> to <hi>Religion,</hi> as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote so unjust a conceit as that of <hi>Philosophy's</hi> being an enemy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Philosophers</hi> were the <hi>Priests</hi> among the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and several
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53395:73"/>
other Nations in ancient times; and there was never more need, that the <hi>Priests</hi> should be <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> than in <hi>ours;</hi> For we are liable every day to be called out to <hi>make good</hi> our <hi>Foundations</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Atheist,</hi> the <hi>Sadduce,</hi> and <hi>Enthusiast;</hi> and 'tis the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>his Works</hi> that must fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish us with some of the most <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> Weapons of <hi>Defence.

                        <hi>steel,</hi> and <hi>brass</hi> for our <hi>defence;</hi> and <hi>they</hi> have little else than <hi>twigs,</hi> and <hi>bull-rushes</hi> for the <hi>assault;</hi> we have <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>firm</hi> ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they are lost in <hi>smoak,</hi> and <hi>mists;</hi> They tread among Bogs, and dangerous Fens, and reel near the Rocks, and Steeps.

                     <p>If this Discourse chance to meet with any that are guilty of these dangerous follies, it will, I hope, convince them, That they have no reason to be <hi>afraid</hi> of <hi>Philosophy,</hi>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:53395:74"/>
or to <hi>despise</hi> its <hi>aids</hi> in the concerns of Religion. And for <hi>those,</hi> who never yet thought of this <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> to <hi>glorifie</hi> God for his <hi>Works,</hi> I wish it may awaken them to more <hi>attentive</hi> consideration of the <hi>wisdom</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> that is in <hi>them;</hi> and so excite their pious <hi>acclamations.</hi> And to encourage them to it, I shall adventure to add,</p>
                     <p>That it seems very probable, that much of the <hi>matter</hi> of those <hi>Hallelujah's</hi> and <hi>triumphant</hi> Songs, that shall be the <hi>joyful</hi> entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>blessed,</hi> will be taken from the <hi>wonders</hi> of <hi>Gods Works;</hi> and who knows, but the <hi>contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>these,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> in them, shall make up a good part of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of those <hi>glorified Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi> who will then have incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable

advantages for the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into those <hi>effects</hi> of Divine <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> beyond what are possible for us mortals to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And those <hi>discoveries</hi> which for ever they shall make in that <hi>immense Treasure</hi> of <hi>Art,</hi> the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi> must needs sill their Souls every moment with <hi>pleasant</hi> asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and inslame their hearts with the <hi>ardors</hi> of the highest <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>devotion,</hi> which will breathe forth in <hi>everlasting thanksgivings.</hi> And thus the <hi>study of Gods Works</hi> joyned with those <hi>pious sentiments</hi> they deserve, is a kind of <hi>partial</hi> anticipation of <hi>Heaven;</hi> And next after the <hi>contemplations</hi> of his <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>wonders</hi> of his <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> discovered in our Redemption, it is one of the <hi>best,</hi> and <hi>noblest</hi> imployments; the most becoming

XIX. <hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God, and the Firmament sheweth his handy works.</hi> And again, Psal. 14. 8. 3. <hi>Praise him Sun and Moon, praise him ye Stars, and Light;</hi> which intimates, that <hi>these Works</hi> of <hi>his</hi> afford matter to our <hi>reasons</hi> for <hi>religious</hi> acknowledgments. And <hi>Reason</hi> proves the <hi>existence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> from the <hi>beauty,</hi> and <hi>order,</hi>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:53395:87"/>
and <hi>ends,</hi> and <hi>usefulness</hi> of the <hi>Creatures;</hi> for these are demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strative Arguments of the being of a <hi>wise,</hi> and <hi>omnipotent</hi> mind, that hath framed all things so <hi>orderly,</hi> and <hi>exactly;</hi> and <hi>that mind</hi> is <hi>God.</hi> This Article then, <hi>Reason</hi> proves, which was the first branch of the <hi>particular;</hi> and I add, that it is <hi>Reason only</hi> that can do it; which was the <hi>other.</hi> This you will see when you consider, that there are but three things from whence the <hi>existence</hi> of any <hi>Being</hi> can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>viz.

                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>Sense,</hi> it hath no more to do here but to present <hi>matter</hi> for our <hi>Reasons</hi> to work on; and <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion supposeth</hi> the <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God,</hi> and cannot <hi>prove</hi> it; for we can have no security that the <hi>Revelation</hi>

is <hi>true,</hi> till we are assured it is from <hi>God;</hi> or from <hi>some Commissioned</hi> by <hi>him.</hi> The <hi>knowledge</hi> of his <hi>Being</hi> therefore, must <hi>precede</hi> our <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Revelation;</hi> and <hi>so</hi> cannot be <hi>deduced</hi> from it.

                  <p>And the next to this is the other Principle mentioned.</p>

The <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> This also is to be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> by <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>only</hi> by <hi>It.</hi> The <hi>great Argument</hi> for the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> is the <hi>Testimony</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himself useth <hi>this</hi> Argument to gain credit to his Doctrines, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me for the works sake; The works that I do bear testimony of me; and if I had not done among them</hi>

And the <hi>Apostles</hi> continually urge <hi>that great Miracle,</hi> the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> from the <hi>dead</hi> for the conviction both of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> That he was the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and his <hi>Doctrines true.</hi> Now <hi>Miracles</hi> are an <hi>Argument</hi> to our <hi>Reasons,</hi> and we <hi>reason</hi> from them thus: <hi>Miracles</hi> are <hi>Gods Seal,</hi> and they are wrought by <hi>his Power,</hi> and He is <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and would not lend <hi>these</hi> to <hi>Impostors</hi> to <hi>cheat,</hi> and <hi>abuse</hi> mankind.

And the <hi>certainty</hi> of the <hi>conveyance</hi> of <hi>these</hi> things to <hi>us</hi> is evinced <hi>also</hi> by <hi>numerous convictive Reasons:</hi> So that, the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> is <hi>secure;</hi> and that such <hi>Doctrines</hi> were <hi>taught,</hi> as are ascribed to those <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> persons; and <hi>those</hi> persons <hi>inspired</hi> that <hi>penned them,</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>same</hi> way: And <hi>so</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows from the <hi>whole,</hi> that the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> is the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and the <hi>Old Testament</hi> is confirmed by <hi>that.</hi> Thus <hi>Reason</hi> proves the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of <hi>Scripture;</hi> and those

                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:53395:90"/>(1.) That the <hi>Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> are revealed in the <hi>Holy Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> 'tis clear; and they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from <hi>Reason</hi> also; For 'tis a <hi>general Principle</hi> of all Mankind, <hi>That God is a Being absolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi> And hence <hi>Reason concludes</hi> all the <hi>particular Attributes</hi> of his <hi>Being;</hi> since <hi>Wisdom, Goodness, Power,</hi> and the rest are <hi>perfections,</hi> and imply <hi>nothing</hi> of <hi>imperfection,</hi> or <hi>defect;</hi> and therefore ought to be ascribed to the <hi>infinitely perfect Essence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) That there is <hi>moral good,</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> is discoverable by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> as well as <hi>Scripture.</hi> For these are <hi>Reasons Maxims; That every thing is made for an end;</hi> and <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is directed to its end by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rules: these Rules in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of understanding, and choice,</hi>

                  <p>(3.) The <hi>Immortality</hi> of our <hi>Souls</hi> is <hi>plain</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> proves it, by shewing the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality</hi> of our <hi>natures;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> it doth from the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Sense;</hi> and our <hi>perception</hi> of <hi>spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and <hi>Universals;</hi> Of <hi>Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, Metaphysical,</hi> and <hi>Mathematical Notions;</hi> From our <hi>compounding Propositions;</hi> and drawing <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> from them; From the <hi>vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>quickness</hi> of our <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> of our <hi>Wills,</hi> all which are beyond the <hi>powers</hi> of <hi>matter,</hi> and therefore argue a <hi>Being</hi> that is <hi>spiritual,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>immortal,</hi> which <hi>inference,</hi> the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of <hi>Spirits proves.</hi> Also, the <hi>Moral</hi> Arguments of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> from the <hi>goodness</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and

his <hi>Justice</hi> in distributing <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>punishments;</hi> the nature of <hi>virtue,</hi> and <hi>tendencies</hi> of <hi>religious appetites,</hi> conclude, I think, <hi>strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That there is a life after this.</hi> Thus in short of the <hi>Principles,</hi> I called <hi>mixt,</hi> which <hi>Reason demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</hi>

                  <p>BUT for the <hi>others,</hi> viz. (II.) Those of <hi>pure Revelation, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> cannot <hi>prove</hi> them <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> nor is it to be expected that it <hi>should:</hi> For <hi>they</hi> are <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Testimony;</hi> and we are no more to look for <hi>immediate proof</hi> from <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of <hi>those</hi> things, than we are to expect, that <hi>abstracted Reason</hi> should demonstrate, That there is such a place as <hi>China;</hi> or, that there was such a man as <hi>Julius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar.</hi> All that it can do <hi>here,</hi> is to assert, and make good the <hi>credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:53395:91"/>
and <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Testimonies</hi> that relate such matters: and <hi>that</hi> it doth in the <hi>present</hi> case, <hi>proving</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Scripture;</hi> and thereby in a <hi>remoter</hi> way, It <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates</hi> all the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> which the <hi>Divine Oracles immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> discover. And it is no more disparagement to our <hi>Reasons,</hi> that they cannot evince those <hi>Sacred Articles</hi> by their own <hi>unaided</hi> force, than it is a <hi>disgrace</hi> unto them, that they cannot know that there are such things, as <hi>Colours,</hi> without the help of our <hi>eyes;</hi> or that there are <hi>Sounds,</hi> without the <hi>faculty</hi> of <hi>hearing.</hi> And if Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must be called <hi>blind</hi> upon this account, because it cannot <hi>know of it self</hi> such things as belong to <hi>Testimony</hi> to discover; the <hi>best eyes</hi> in the world may be <hi>so</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53395:92"/>
also, because they are not <hi>sagacious</hi> enough to <hi>see sounds;</hi> and the best <hi>Palate dull,</hi> and <hi>dead,</hi> because it cannot <hi>taste</hi> the <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though I have said, that <hi>Reason</hi> cannot of it self, <hi>immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove</hi> the <hi>truths</hi> of <hi>pure Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> Yet (1.) it demonstrates the <hi>divine Authority</hi> of the <hi>Testimony</hi> that declares <hi>them;</hi> and <hi>that way proves</hi> even <hi>these Articles.</hi> If <hi>this</hi> be not enough,</p>
                  <p>I add the <hi>second Assertion,</hi> (II.) That <hi>Reason defends all the Mysteries of Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> and for <hi>this,</hi> I must desire you to take notice, that there are <hi>two</hi> ways, whereby any thing may be <hi>defended,</hi> viz. Either (1) By shewing the <hi>manner</hi> how the thing is; or, if that cannot be done, by
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53395:92"/>
shewing (2) That it ought to be <hi>believed,</hi> though the <hi>manner</hi> of it be not <hi>known:</hi> For instance, if any one denies all sorts of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were in the <hi>Ark,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that it is <hi>impossible</hi> they should be contained within such a space; He that can shew how <hi>this</hi> might <hi>be,</hi> by a <hi>distinct</hi> enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> with <hi>due</hi> allowance for the <hi>unknown Species,</hi> and a <hi>computation</hi> of the <hi>particular capacity</hi> of the <hi>Ark;</hi> he <hi>defends</hi> the <hi>Sacred History</hi> the <hi>first way:</hi> But if another denies the <hi>conversion</hi> of <hi>Aaron's Rod</hi> into a <hi>Serpent,</hi> upon the same account, of the <hi>unconceivableness</hi> of the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> how it was done; this cannot indeed be <hi>defended</hi> the <hi>former way:</hi> But then it may, by representing that the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is <hi>infinite;</hi>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:53395:93"/>
and can easily <hi>do</hi> what we cannot <hi>comprehend,</hi> how it is effected; and that we ought to <hi>believe</hi> upon the <hi>credit</hi> of the <hi>Testimony</hi> (<hi>that</hi> being well <hi>proved</hi> to us) though the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>this miraculous</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and such others as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, <hi>be unknown.</hi> And a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
