            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SEEing, it hath graciouſly pleaſed Almighty GOD, in his Infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to diſcover to me as well as many more in <hi>England,</hi> (who for ſometime had lived in communion with the People called <hi>Quak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers)</hi> thoſe many groſs Errours, that were maintained in Print, by their Chief Teachers; which nevertheleſs, I my ſelf never owned, but alwayes ſincerely believed the moſt neceſſary fundamental Truths of Chriſtianity, profeſt in common by all <hi>PROTESTANTS;</hi> though I muſt confeſs I was ſo far miſled, as to believe that more ſtreſs was to be laid on the

Light within, then on Faith in an outward Crucified JESUS; &amp;c. I therefore judged my ſelf bound in Conſcience, not only to ſeparat from them, but alſo to return to this my Native Countrey, where I firſt joined with them, and there give a publick Teſtimony to the Truth, and endeavour in the Strength of the LORD, to ſatisfie my old Friends and Relations, that as I erred through ignorance and unbelief, never knowing nor being any way perſwaded, till of late that ſuch groſs Errours were owned by them, which if I had in the leaſt ſuſpected, I think I ſhould never have been prevailed with to have joined with them: So I hope, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> both here and elſe where (who are ſincere and honeſt hearted) when they are made ſenſible of and diſcover the ſame (which they may doe, by impartially ſearching, as I have done their own authentick writtings) ſhall be of one mind with me, and with me alſo obtain mercy, ſo as to have reaſon to magnifie the Infinite Goodneſs and Love of GOD in <hi>CHRIST JESUS</hi> our <hi>LORD;</hi> Of this I conceive the more hopes, ſince I got the Anſwers of the Principal <hi>Quakers,</hi> of the laſt Monethly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> given to ſome <hi>Queries</hi> propoſed by me at that Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both which, together with ſome <hi>Remarks</hi> on their ſaid <hi>Anſwers</hi> are here Printed by Authority of the Magiſtrats of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> and at the deſire of ſome of them, as well as the intreaty of my Friends in this place, I have been induced to make a ſhort Narrative of what paſſed before the giving, in or Anſwering the ſaid <hi>Queries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after my arrival at <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> I had occaſion to meet with ſome of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom I diſcourſed, and more particularly <hi>A. Jaffray</hi> their chief Teacher in this place, and in our Conferences together, I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd ſome groſs paſſages in <hi>W. Penn's</hi> Books &amp;c. But he being diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, propoſed that himſelf and I, with ſome friends of each ſide ſhould meet, and after theſe Books were produced, it might be ſeen, whether ſuch palpable and groſs Errours were vouched in them yea or not. Having ſo ſoon as poſſible I could, got ſome of them, I wrot to the ſaid <hi>A. J.</hi> deſiring to know, when we ſhould meet, in anſwer to which he ſent me a very paſſionat and indiſcreet Letter, intirely declining the Meeting (though he himſelf firſt propoſed the ſame) and therein acquainted me if I had any thing to ſay againſt them, I ſhould give it, in Write or Print: I therefore went to their Monethly Meeting, where <hi>Alexander Forbes</hi> of <hi>Craigie</hi> and <hi>Alexander Patton</hi> of <hi>Kinnaldie</hi> (Bailies in <hi>Aberdeen)</hi>


               <pb facs="tcp:36490:5"/>
with a great many more Perſons of good Note were preſent, and there, after ſome ſhort diſcourſe, I read the <hi>Queries</hi> (as they are here Printed) of which I left a ſigned Copie with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and gave another to <hi>Bailie Paton;</hi> to which after ſome time I at length obtained the Anſwers, which I have hereafter ſubjoined. And that it may appear how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly they lay claim to the immediat and infallible illuminations of the Spirit of GOD, which is in all times, places and perſons, the ſame without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction or variation; I have annexed ſome Quotations out of their moſt approved Writters, which moſt plainly contradict the Doctrine now ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly owned by <hi>A. J.</hi> and his Friends. Theſe paſſages I have here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced are not to be looked upon, as the opinions of private Authors among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but as the Doctrine and Principles maintained by the whole Body of that people in <hi>England;</hi> For their Books are not allowed to be Printed or Re-Printed, till firſt they are approved off, by the ſecond days Meeting at <hi>London,</hi> and all ſuch Books ſo approved off, are by an order among them, tranſmitted to other Monethly or Quarterly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings &amp;c. and there is none that I have made uſe of, have ever been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected or publickly diſapproved by them, (ſo far as <hi>I</hi> know.)</p>
            <p>One thing more I muſt ſay, which is, that as it is well known to divers in this place, that no outward proſpect ever mov'd me to leave the Proteſtant Religion and join with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo I can ſay in the ſight of Almighty GOD, and in the ſincerity of my heart, that no Worldly intereſt induced me, now to leave their communion, but plain conviction and full perſwaſion of thoſe many groſs and pernicious Hereſies which were very clearly diſcovered to me in their Writtings. And as I am convinced, that many ſober and ſerious Perſons among them, do not believe or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as imagine that ſuch unchriſtian Doctrines were ever broached or mantained by their chief Ieachers, ſo I heartily pray that the <hi>LORD</hi> would enlighten their minds that they may both diſcover and acknowledge their Errours and abhore them as much as I do.</p>

            <p>HAving the occaſion of the Bearer, I thought fit to ſend you my fourth Narrative, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther late Book of mine called the <hi>Deiſm of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Penn,</hi> &amp;c: which I deſire you to read im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially and without prejudice. I hope ye will not be ſo ſtrait as not to read them, for as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I could and did very freely read the Books of any againſt me, ſo I ſtill can, and do readily read them. The ſaid Narrative as to the truth of the <hi>Quotations,</hi> is atteſted by men of Credit, and beſide I ſuppoſe, many of the Books that I have quoted in the ſame, ye may have by you, and ſome others ye may eaſily procure, whereby to find whether my <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> be true and juſt, and if you find them ſo to be, I hope you will calmly and ſeriouſly conſider them, and Compare them with the Holy Scriptures, which I beſeech you more diligently to ſearch, with earneſt Prayer to God Almigty, that he would give you a good underſtanding, by His <hi>Divine Illumination,</hi> by which you will ſee that the chief Teachers of the <hi>Quakers</hi> (whom both Ye and I have in our Ignorance owned for true Teachers) have Taught very falſe Doctrines, contradicting the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> in diverſe of the great fundamentals of Chriſtianity.</p>

I freely own with ſorrow and deep Repentance that I have been injurious to You and others thereaway, not in any Wordly matter, but while I was with You, and in my ignorant Zeal, thinking that I did God good Service, that I was any wayes inſtrumental to miſlead and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inform You, and turn You out of the way in any of the leaſt Principle or Practice of Chriſtian Religion. For this I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I am a great Debtor to You, and would willingly make reſtitution and be at as great and greater Pains to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive You, and bring You out of the Mire, as ever I was to lead You into it, but if You refuſe my offer, God (I doubt not) will forgive me, and not lay it to my Charge, and the Sin will ly at your Door.

Ye Your ſelves know how little God is Worſhipped with Prayer and Thankſgiving in the Families of the <hi>Quakers</hi> generally, (very few excepted) excuſing all by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of mental and inward Prayer, and want of Divine Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to carry them forth in external Acts of Worſhip.

Pretenders to Spirituality, among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are Maſters of Families and have Wives and Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, yet rarely Bow their bodily Knees to God in their Families. And Set-times of Prayer and Thankſgiving, either for the Cloſet or Family Worſhip have been generally laid aſide.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Chief Things for which I have blamed my ſelf, in being inſtrumental in former Times to have miſinformed you though I think all along, I was generally more Charitable in Judgement towards many others of other Societies then many were, or now are among the People called <hi>Quakers.</hi> But it's a great Comfort to me that upon a ſtrict Examination of my former Perſwaſions and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as extant in my former Books (for which I think I can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to You) as well as what I have declared among You, I was never guilty of that Horrid Unbelief and Antichriſtian Errors and Hereſies, contradicting the chief Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, that I have found the Chief Engliſh Teachers among the <hi>Quakers</hi> guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of. I deſire to Bleſs God my Preſerver, who all along hath Preſerved me ſound in the Faith, as touching all the twelve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Articles of that called the <hi>Apoſtles-Creed,</hi> the <hi>God Head</hi> and <hi>Man hood</hi> of Our <hi>Bleſſed Lord JESUS CHRIST,</hi> His Perſon and Offices.

So that it was no ſmall Surpriſe to me, to find you join in a Combination againſt me, with my Adverſaries here as you know, ye and Your Friends generally did, ſoon after my Arrival into <hi>England</hi> from <hi>America.</hi> Your pretence then was that ye could not believe, that Friends either in <hi>America</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> were guilty of the Errors I had Charged them with, but if you will give your ſelves the Liberty to Read my late Books, and particularly the two, I now ſend you,


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36490:7"/>
I hope ye will be convinced of the Truth of my Charge, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe hereaway both in City and Country, through the Mercy of God are ſo convinced, but I fear that ſome among you are too deeply guilty of ſome of the ſame Errors. And if ye in particular are not, how can ye in Conſcience, own them to be your Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Brethren, whom I have proved ſo evidently guilty of them, as particularly the chief Teachers among the <hi>Quakers</hi> hereaway, ſome Living and ſome Deceaſed.</p>
            <p>And I earneſtly requeſt you to diſtinguiſh betwixt any good things, either in Doctrine or Practice; which ye have ſeen or obſerved in me, and whatever was contrary thereunto, ſo as to cleave unto the former and only reject the latter. What Honeſty or Sobriety and Chriſtian Practice ye ever ſaw in me, I hope to perſevere in it and increaſe in the ſame, and I deſire you to do the like; but reject your Errors, your Uncharitableneſs of Judgement towards others, your Spiritual Pride, and over high Eſteem of your ſelves. Believe not every Spirit either in your ſelves or others, but try the Spirits, and bring all Doctrines and Practices, to the Teſt of the Holy Scriptures, and pray God, to give you that True Light and Diſcerning, to help you to make an Impartial Examination. It hath been a great default generally among the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and remains among them too much to Countenance Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Perſons, if they pretend to the Spirits Teachings and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Preach and Pray, and Travel from Place to Place as Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of others, when yet they want to be taught the firſt Principles of Chriſtianity, and its to be feared ye have ſuch ignorant Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers among you. I am ſure I remember when ſome of you uſed to blame it in my hearing, and as I deſire you to make a diſtinction betwixt what is right and wrong, in any of my former Doctrines or Practices, (I hope none of you could ever charge me with any Immorrality or Scandalous Converſation when among you, but that if I wanted an Atteſtation to that, I think ye would do me that Juſtice to give me an ample Teſtimony) ſo I would have you to know, that I continue grounded and firmly perſwaded as to that moſt neceſſary and excellent Doctrine of Gods Inward Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by his Holy Spirit Light and Grace, and his gracious ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

and Aſſiſtances to enable us, and all good Chriſtians to perform every acceptable Service to him. And whatever ye or any others, may or doe judge of me, I bleſs my Gracious God, that I feel my ſelf a living member of <hi>CHRIST</hi>'s Body, by partaking daily of the Life and living Vertue of the Head, <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> our Lord, and a Living branch upon that living Vine, and my care is and ever I hope ſhall be, to abide in him, which I bleſs God for, I find by true experience, that I can remain and abide ſuch, and yet be reformed in many things in my judgement, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe practices, from what I formerly was. It hath been a great miſtake in us, to think that we could not be more holy, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy as we think we are, or were, without being ſo exceſſivly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable towards others, and ſo contrary to them in our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions and Practices, when as many of their Perſwaſions and Practices were better then ours, and others of them more inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive. I hope ye will excuſe my writing thus largely unto you, for it is in true Love and good will, however you receive it, and as I have ſaid I do not expoſtulat with you, for your injuring me, for I have more injured you (though not by any Immorality,) but by being inſtrumental to have in any wayes miſinformed you.

Is it altogether, and wholy, as neceſſary for us to believe in CHRIST without us, for our Eternal Salvation, as to believe in his Spiritual Light within us? and is not the Faith in the Man CHRIST, as he dyed for our Sins, and roſe again, and is at the Right Hand of GOD, and maketh interceſſion for us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 34. neceſſary to be Preached frequently, as well as his inward appearance, by every true Miniſter of CHRIST?</head>
               <p>A. <hi>We believe, (as in our Anſwſer to the ſecond Query) that its altogether neceſſary, for us to believe in</hi> CHRIST <hi>without us, for our Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, where the means of the knowledge thereof can be had: And alſo that the Faith in the Man</hi> CHRIST JESUS, <hi>as he dyed for our Sins, and roſe again, and is at the Right Hand of</hi> GOD, <hi>&amp;c. is neceſſary to be Preached by all true Miniſters, as they are led there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the Spirit of</hi> GOD, <hi>and which is frequently practiſed amongſt us, as may be witneſſed by ſuch as come to our Meetings, according to,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23.</p>

B.) that the knowledge of His being outwardly Crucified is that one thing neceſſary, for People muſt know him in them.</hi> And as a confirmation of this, in the ſecond Propoſition of his Apologie, <hi>page</hi> 269. (he ſayeth) <hi>Which Revelation of God by the Spirit, whither by outward voices, or appearances, dreams, or inward objective manifeſtations in the heart, were of old the formal object of their Faith, and remains yet ſo to be, ſince the object of the Saints Faith, is the ſame in all Ages,</hi> and in Conſequence to this laſt part, he ſayes <hi>pag.</hi> 279. <hi>that which now cometh under debait, is what we have aſſerted in the laſt place,</hi> viz. <hi>that the ſame continueth to be the object of the Saints Faith to this</hi>

                  <hi>day,</hi> &amp;c. here is not one Word of Faith in CHRIST without us, but on the Contrary, the formal object of the Saints Faith, in all Ages is inward Revelations, and the Light within.

                  <hi>R.</hi> I ſhould truly rejoice, and be heartily glade to find both, <hi>A.</hi> J. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all others among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> manifeſt themſelves to be realy ſound and ſincere, not only in ſome but in all the fundamental Truths of the Chriſtian Religion; but whether <hi>A.</hi> J. and his Friends have evidenced themſelves to be ſuch, by their Anſwers, to the <hi>Queries</hi> before recited, I leave that to all impartial and judicious Readers to judge. And for a manifeſt Tryal of the ſincerity and ſoundneſs of their Faith, in thoſe points wherein they ſeem orthodox, and that they have no ſecret reſerved meanings, but what is agreeable to the Senſe of all ſound Proteſtants, it is here propoſed to them, (and which is reaſonably expected) that they give a publick Teſtimony in Writing, againſt thoſe erroneous paſſages and poſitions, as they are here ſet down as before, and quoted out of their approved and antient Friends Books, which plainly contradicts their own orthodox Anſwers. They are obliged (I think) either to own, or elſe to diſown theſe errors: the latter I hope they will ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly doe, as being no Reſpecter of Perſons. For the Truth muſt be owned and preferred before all things and perſons, tho never ſo near or dear to us. And unleſs <hi>A.</hi> J. &amp;c. doe this; their ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity will ſtill be ſuſpected, notwithſtanding all their great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. As for their ſaying, we are not bound in Reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Teſtimony of an avowed Adverſary, againſt our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; as I would not be impoſed upon in ſuch weighty concerns, ſo I doe not impoſe my Teſtimony upon them, but have fairly and ſincerely laid before them, their own antient and moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent approved Friends Teſtimonies, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> And I could have produced many more Quotations, if


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36490:18"/>
they had been ſo candid to have granted me the uſe of their Friends Books, which I had not by me here, (and I being a Traveller could not be other wayes provided with) however, I offer this to them, let the Books be produced, out of which the Quotations are taken, and let them be peruſed by any judicious and indifferent Perſons, and ſee whither they are juſtly and fairly quoted, and I ſhall ſubmit the ſame to their cenſure. And whoever it is they mean, to be their Brethrens avowed Adverſary: I bleſs GOD I can ſincerely ſay, that I have no Perſonal enmity or Prejudice againſt them, or any Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomever; its true, I deteſt their vile errors, but I ſtill love and reſpect their Perſons, and what I have herein done may ſhew, that it was not through Malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I could alſo have given an account, of many very Unchriſtian and unſavoury Paſſages, which were Preached publickly in their Meetings at <hi>Reading</hi> in <hi>England</hi> where I live, which occaſioned divers to leave them. And whereas they ſay, and if he have any thing to Charge againſt them, among whom he receeds, he wants not opportunity to doe it face to face, and we doubt not but they can clear themſelves ſufficiently. I ſhould be very glade, as I have ſaid before, they would do ſo indeed, but I am ſure, they have never in the leaſt yet done it, as they ought to doe, notwithſtanding of the many opportunitis, and that publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to have cleared themſelves, of what has been charged againſt them, and ſtill lyes at their door uncleared and unanſwered by them; and I am fully ſatiſfied, that notwitſtanding of their many late new Creeds, they can never well clear themſeves, until they publickly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly Retract thoſe Errors in their Printed Books; and when they once do that, I think there is none will be ſo Unchriſtian, as to Charge them any more therewith. There is one or two Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions more, which I think fit to add. G. F. and R. H. ſayes in Truths defence, <hi>p.</hi> 89, <hi>and</hi> 109 <hi>Our giving forth papers and printed Books, it is from the immediat, eternal Sipiritual GOD.</hi>

                  </gap>. Now I leave it to the ſerious Conſideration, of A. J. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

And G. F. pleads for the ſame degree of the Spirit, to know the Scriptures by, as the Prophets and Apoſtles had. See his great <hi>Myſt. p.</hi> 213. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
