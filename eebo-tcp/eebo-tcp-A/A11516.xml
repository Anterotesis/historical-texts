            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO HIS MOST SACRED MAIESTIE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Offer to your MAIESTIES view the trueſt and moſt iudicious Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Hiſtorie, that either mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne times, or any antiquitie hath afforded to the world; impaired (I confeſſe) in beautie, as being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported out of the naturall luſtre both of ſtile and phraſe, by a rude and vnſkilfull Tranſlator, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing altered in the trueth and ſincerity of the matter, which it handleth.</p>
            <p>The Author, a ſtranger to theſe parts, conuerſant onely where the Goſpell cannot be truely preached, was moued to write it, as for the common good of all Chriſtendome, ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in contemplation of your Maieſties ſeruice. For as you hold the higheſt place amongſt all Kings and Princes, and are Gods greateſt Lieutenant vnder the whole cope of heauen, ſo your admirable perfections, of Wiſdome, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Iuſtice, and Religion (with which your royall breaſt is inriched beyond all compariſon to bee made with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) caſt foorth their bright ſhining rayes into all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treis and quarters of the world, and rouſe vp the endeauors of the worthieſt, euen in places the fartheſt remote, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the building vp, or repairing of Gods Church, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:17208:3"/>
farre as the tyranny of Antichriſt, vnder which they liue, and the ſafetie of their liues, which nature bindes them to preſerue, doth giue them leaue. In which number, is the Author of this preſent Treatiſe. The end and ſcope whereof being the glory of <hi>God,</hi> by diſcouery of thoſe practiſes, which, for many yeeres, haue beene concealed by the enemies of CHRIST, the aduancement of true pietie and Religion, I know not to whom it may be addreſſed more iuſtly, then to the greateſt Maieſty vpon the whole ſurface of the earth, and the chiefeſt <hi>Defender</hi> of the true faith amongſt vs.</p>
            <p>And ſurely if euer any booke (except onely the Booke of God) did deſerue the protection of ſo excellent a Patron, it is this Hiſtorie of the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> For, of all the things in the world, Religion is of the greateſt conſequence, and, in Religion, Ecumenicall Councels (next after the holy Writ) haue euer caried the greateſt ſway; which being true, and guided by the <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> haue beene cauſes of infinite bleſsings, but being pretended onely, and gouerned by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane policies and Arte, haue brought foorth as many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes and afflictions to the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Now in this of <hi>Trent</hi> it is plainely diſcouered, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (of whom eight liued and died, during the time of the Synode and treatie thereof) in ſtead of being CHRISTS holy <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icars,</hi> as they pretend, haue beene the greateſt, and moſt pernicious <hi>quackeſaluing iuglers</hi> that euer the earth did beare.</p>
            <p>It would be infinite to relate the Stratagems they vſed to diuert it, before it began; their poſtings to and fro, to hinder the propoſing of thoſe things which they thought would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh their profit, or pull downe their pride; their policies, to enthrall the Prelates and Diuines, by hopes and feares; their diligence in ſending their adherents to <hi>Trent,</hi> and ſo, by procuring a <hi>maior</hi> part of voices, to make themſelues the abſolute Lords of all the determinations that paſſed. By which deuices that which was deſired by godly men, as the onely remedy againſt all the errors in manners and doctrine, both in Church and Common-wealth, and eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the greateſt enormities of the Popes themſelues, hath
<pb facs="tcp:17208:3"/>
beene wreſted to a quite contrary vſe, to weaken the lawfull rights of Kings and Princes, to peruert the doctrine and Hierarchie of the Church of GOD, and to lift vp the Papacy to an vnſufferable height of pride. This is that holy and great Synod, of which the Romaniſts doe boaſt themſelues ſo much.</p>
            <p>And indeed euery one of any meane capacitie may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, that many controuerted points betweene them and the true Profeſſors, neceſſary (as they maintaine) for the ſauing of mens ſoules, had neuer any colourable eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but this; which inſenſibly creeping in by the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the vulgar, or ſecretly ſet on foote by thoſe that were ambitious and couetous, or (at the beſt) blindly zealous, haue alwaies beene oppoſed by the Orthodox, euen pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, vntill the malitious induſtry of the greater part, put to ſilence (though neuer quite ouercame) the paucitie of the better. So that their vanting of the Antiquitie of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of the infancie of ours, is vaine and idle.</p>
            <p>And if they will glory (as vſually they doe) of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſalitie of their doctrine, becauſe it was eſtabliſhed (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth) by <hi>the holy Ecumenicall Councell of Trent,</hi> as they terme it, none can better iudge then your MAIESTY how factious and how vnlawfull that aſſembly was, and, by this Hiſtorie, the whole world may vnderſtand the weakneſſe of that foundation.</p>
            <p>The Almightie bleſſe your MAIESTIE with length of daies, ſtrength of bodie, loyaltie of your people, and with all imaginable happineſſe in your moſt Royall Progenie, and in ſwaying the Scepter of your Dominions.</p>

For this Councell deſired and procured by godly men, to reunite the <note place="margin">1500 ALEXAND. 6. MAXIMILL 1. HENRY 7. LEVVIS 12. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Councell was contrary to the opinion of all men.</note> Church which began to bee diuided, hath ſo eſtabliſhed the Schiſme, and made the parties ſo obſtinate, that the diſcords are become irreconciliable: and being managed by Princes for reformation of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, hath cauſed the greateſt deformation that euer was ſince Chriſtianity did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: and hoped for by the Biſhops to regaine the Epiſcopall authority, vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for the moſt part by the Pope, hath made them looſe it altogether, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into greater ſeruitude: on the contrary, feared and auoided by the Sea of Rome, as a potent meanes, to moderate the exorbitant power, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from ſmall beginnings by diuers degrees vnto an vnlimited exceſſe, it hath ſo eſtabliſhed and confirmed the ſame, ouer that part which remaineth ſubiect vnto it, that it was neuer ſo great nor ſo ſoundly rooted.</p>
            <p>It will not be inconuenient therefore to call it the Iliade of our age; in the explanation whereof I will exactly follow the truth, not being poſſeſſed with any paſſion that may make me erre. And hee that ſhall obſerue that I ſpeake more copiouſly of ſome times, and more ſparingly of others, let him remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that all fields are not equally fruitfull, nor all graines deſerue to be kept: and that, of thoſe which the Reaper would preſerue, ſome eare eſcapeth the hand, or the edge of the ſickle; that being the condition of euery harueſt, that ſome part remaineth to be gleaned after.</p>
            <p>But firſt I muſt call to minde, that it hath beene a moſt ancient cuſtome in the Church of Chriſt to compoſe the differences of Religion, and to reforme <note place="margin">The originall cauſe &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</note> the corrupted diſcipline, by the conuocation of Synods. So, the firſt which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the life time of many of the holy Apoſtles, whether the conuerted Gentiles were bound to obſerue <hi>Moſes</hi> law, was compoſed by a meeting in Hieruſalem of foure Apoſtles, and of all the faithfull which were in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: by which example in the occurrences which incidently ſprung vp in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery prouince for the ſpace of 200. yeeres and more afterwards, the Biſhops and chiefeſt of the Churches aſſembled themſelues together to qualifie and end them; that being the onely remedy to reunite diuiſions, and to accord contrary opinions.</p>
            <p>But after that it pleaſed God to giue peace vnto his Church, by exciting <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to fauour religion, as it was more eaſie for many Churches to communicate and treate together, ſo alſo the diuiſions became more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. And whereas before, the differences went not out of a city, or, at the moſt, out of a Prouince, now by reaſon of the liberty of meeting together, they extended themſelues ouer the whole Empire. Wherefore alſo it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Councels (which were the vſual remedie) ſhould be aſſembled from places more diſtant. Whereupon a Councell of the whole Empire, being congregated in thoſe times by that Prince, it had the name of the holy and great Synod; and a litle after was called the general &amp; Oecumenical Councel, though not aſſembled from all parts of the Church, a great part whereof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it ſelfe beyond the bounds of the Romane Empire; but becauſe the vſe of that age was to call the Emperour Lord of the whole habitable earth, howbeit the tenth part thereof was not ſubiect vnto him. By which exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the like Councels were called by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> his ſucceſſors in other occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring differences of Religion. And though the Empire was diuided into

            <p n="7">7 But after that the Eaſt was ſo diuided from the Weſt, that there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no more communion in the Soueraignty, and after that the Eaſt was for the moſt part poſſeſſed by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and the Weſt parted amongſt many Princes, the name of an Vniuerſall and oecumenicall Councell was no more deriued from the Roman Empire, but amongſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> from the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the fiue Patriarkes, and in theſe countreys of ours, from the vnitie and communion of thoſe Kingdomes and States which obeyed the Pope in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Eccleſiaſticall. And the aſſembling of theſe hath beene continued, not to appeaſe the diſſentions about Religion principally, as before, but either to make warre in the Holy-land, or to compoſe Schiſmes and diuiſions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſe for controuerſies betweene the Biſhops and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes.</p>
            <p n="8">8 In the beginning of the 16. centurie of yeeres after the natiuitie of our <note place="margin">1500</note> Sauiour Chriſt, there appeared no vrgent cauſe to celebrate a Councell, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any likely to happen for a long ſpace. For the complaints of many Churches againſt the greatneſſe of the Court, ſeemed abſolutely to be appeaſed, and all the countreys of the Weſterne Chriſtians were in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and obedience of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Onely in a ſmall part, that is in that tract where the Alpes are ioyned with the Pyrences, there were ſome remainders of the olde <hi>Waldenſes</hi> or <hi>Albigenſes.</hi> In whom notwithſtanding <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in the Alpes.</note> there was ſo great ſimplicitie and ignorance in learning, that they were not fit to communicate their doctrine vnto others; beſides their neighbours conceiued ſo ſiniſter an opinion of their impietie and obſcenitie, that there was no danger that the contagion could ſpread any further.</p>
            <p n="9">9 In ſome Cantons alſo of <hi>Bohemia</hi> there were ſome few who maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Picards in Bohemia.</note> the ſame doctrine, euen remnants of thoſe whom the Bohemians call Picards; whoſe increaſe could not be feared for the ſame reaſon.</p>
            <p n="10">10 In the ſame Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia</hi> there were ſome followers of <hi>Iohn Hus,</hi> which were called <hi>Caliſtini,</hi> or <hi>Subutraque,</hi> who, except that particular, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caliſtial</hi> in Bohemia.</note> that in the holy Communion they miniſtred the Cup vnto the people, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things differed not much from the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But theſe alſo were not eſteemed conſiderable, aſwell for their ſmall number, as becauſe they wanted learning; neither did it appeare that they deſired to communicate their doctrine, nor that others were curious to vnderſtand it.</p>
            <p n="11">11 There was yet ſome danger of Schiſme. For <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond, hauing <note place="margin">Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond was more a ſouldier then a Clergie man.</note> addicted himſelfe more to the Arts of warre, then to the Prieſtly miniſtery, and gouerned the Popedome with exceſſiue imperiouſnes towards the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Cardinals, had conſtrained ſome of them to ſeparate themſelues from him, and to call a Councell. And the French King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Levvis</hi> the 12. excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</note> by the ſame Pope, had withdrawen his obedience from him, and was ioyned with the ſeparated Cardinals; which beginning, did ſeeme might produce ſome important co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion.

            </p>
            <p n="12">12 <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, as one whoſe birth and education was noble, adorned the Papacie with many good parts which he brought into it; amongſt which were his ſingular learning in humanitie, goodneſſe, and a marueilous ſweete manner in treating of affayres, together with a pleaſing behauiour, more then humane, ioyned with incomparable liberalitie, and a great inclination to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour thoſe that were learned, and endowed with any extraordinary quality. Which vertues were not found in that Sea of a long time before, neither e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, nor neere vnto his. And he would haue been a Pope abſolutely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate, if with theſe he had ioyned ſome knowledge in things that concerne Religion, and ſome more propenſion vnto pietie, of both which he ſeemed careleſſe. And as he was moſt liberall and well ſeene in the Arte of giuing, ſo in that other of gaining he was not able enough of himſelfe, but vſed the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of <hi>Lorenzo Pucci,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Santi Quatro,</hi> a man exceeding ſufficient in that behalfe.</p>
            <p n="13">13 <hi>Leo</hi> therefore finding himſelfe in this ſtate, quiet, the Schiſme extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed abſolutely, without an aduerſary, as one may ſay, (becauſe thoſe few <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Caliſtini</hi> were not any way conſiderable) liberall in ſpending and rewarding aſwell his kindred, as Courtiers, and profeſſors of learning, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fountaines, from whence the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was wont to draw riches vnto it ſelfe out of other nations, being dried vp, he thought fit to ſerue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of that of Indulgences.</p>
            <p n="14">14 This manner of gaining money was put in practiſe after the yeere <note place="margin">When the Art of gaining money by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</note> 1100.

And after in progreſſe of time, the ſame indulgences and pardons were giuen for the taking of armes againſt thoſe that obeyed not the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> although they were Chriſtians: and for the moſt part infinite exactions were made vnder thoſe pretences; all which, or the greater part, were applied to other vſes.</p>
            <p n="15">15 <hi>Leo</hi> being counſelled, by the Cardinall of <hi>Santi Quatro,</hi> to follow theſe examples, ſent an Indulgence and pardon for ſinnes throughout all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leo</hi> granted a plenary Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> granting it to whoſoeuer would giue money, and extending of it euen vnto the dead; for whom when the disburſement was made, his will was that they ſhould be freed from the paines of Purgatory; giuing alſo power to eat egges and whitmeats on faſting daies, to chooſe themſelues a Confeſſor, and other ſuch like abilities. And although the execution of this enterpriſe of <hi>Leo</hi> had ſome particular in it that was neither pious nor honeſt, as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall appeare (which did giue ſcandall, and cauſed innouation) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding many of the grants formerly made by the preceding Popes, had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes more vniuſt, and were exerciſed with more auarice and extortion. But oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ariſe many times which are able to produce notable effects, and yet

For the doctrine of Indulgences hauing not beene well examined in former ages, which did neuer conſider how they might bee defended and maintained, or how impugned, the eſſence and cauſes of them were not well vnderſtood. Some thought they were nothing but an abſolution or freeing, made by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Prelate, from penance which the Church in the moſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times impoſed, by way of diſcipline, vpon the penitent, (which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was aſſumed in ſucceeding ages by the Biſhop onely, after delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the penetentiary Prieſt, and in concluſion left wholly to the will of the Confeſſor) and that they deliuered vs not from paying the debt due to the Iuſtice of God. Others thinking that this brought more hurt vnto Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans then benefit, who being deliuered from Canonicall puniſhments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came negligent to ſatisfie the diuine Iuſtice with voluntary penance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bee of opinion, that they ſet vs free from both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but theſe were diuided. Some thought that they ſet vs free, though nothing were giuen in recompence for them. Others, abhorring that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaid, that, by reaſon of the mutuall participation in charitie of the members of holy Church, the penance of one might bee communicated vnto another, and free him by this compenſation. But becauſe it ſeemed that this was more proper to men of an holy and auſtere life, then to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Prelates, there aroſe a third opinion, which made them in part an abſolution, becauſe authority was neceſſary for them, and in part a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. But in regard the Prelates liued not in ſuch ſort, as that they could ſpare much of their merits for others, there was made a treaſury in the Church full of the merits of all thoſe who had more of them then would ſerue their owne turnes; the diſpenſation whereof is committed to the Pope, who, when he giueth Indulgences, recompenſeth the debt of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by aſſigning ſo much in value out of the treaſurie. Neither was there <note place="margin">The treaſure of the Church</note> an end of the difficulties: for it was oppoſed that the merits of Saints being finite and limited, this treaſure might be diminiſhed. Wherefore deſiring to make it indeficient, they added the merits of Chriſt, which are infinite: Whence aroſe a doubt what need there might be of the little drops of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of others, when there was an infinite Ocean of the merits of Chriſt: which gaue cauſe to ſome to make the treaſure to bee onely of the merits of our Sauiour.</p>

with him concerning the heads of his doctrine, rather hearing what he ſaid, then diſputing, to gaine himſelfe credit by the propoſition of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating the buſines. Whereunto when he deſcended, exhorting him not to let ſlip ſo ſecure an occaſion, and ſo profitable, <hi>Luther</hi> anſwered him, with his accuſtomed vehemencie, that no compoſition could be made to the preiudice of the truth; that he had offended no man, nor had neede of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour <note place="margin">At his returne he was more vehement then before.</note> of any; that he feared no threats, and that, if any thing were vnduly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted againſt him, he would appeale to a Councell.

            <p n="25">25 Wherefore the Court in <hi>Rome</hi> ſpake diſgracefully of the Cardinall, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing <note place="margin">The Cardinall is blamed in <hi>Rome</hi> for vſing <hi>Luther</hi> with baſe termes.</note> all the miſcheife to the ſeueritie and baſe termes vſed againſt <hi>Luther;</hi> they blamed him for not hauing promiſed him great riches, a Biſhopricke, and euen the red hat of a Cardinall.

            <p n="26">26 <hi>Martin Luther</hi> perceiuing that his doctrine was eſteemed, and that it <note place="margin">

            <p n="30">30 Notwithſtanding for the many inſtances of the Prelates of <hi>Germanie,</hi> of the Vniuerſities, who, being intereſſed by the ſentence of condemnation, betooke themſelues to the Popes authoritie for their protection, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the continuall importunities of the Friars of <hi>Rome,</hi> he reſolued to yeeld to the common opinion.

The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines alleadged that the doctrine was euidently ſeen to be impious, that the books were divulged, and the ſermons of <hi>Luther</hi> notorious. The others ſaid, that Notoriouſnes did not take away the defence, which is allowed by the law of God and nature, alleadging the vſuall places: <hi>Adam</hi> where art thou? <hi>Where is thy brother Abel?</hi> and in the accident of the fiue Cities, <hi>I will go down and ſee.</hi> They added that the citation of the Auditor the yeere before, by vertue whereof the iudicature was referred to <hi>Caietan</hi> in <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and remained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, if nothing els were, ſhewed it to be neceſſary. After many diſputes, in which the Diuines attributed the deciſion vnto themſelues alone, becauſe the queſtion was in point of faith, &amp; the Lawyers appropriated vnto themſelues as much as concerned the forme of iudgement, a compoſition betweene them was propoſed, diſtinguiſhing the buſineſſe into three parts, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the bookes, and the perſon. For the doctrine, the Canoniſts yeelded that it ſhould be condemned without citation: for the perſon, they perſiſted to maintaine that the citation was neceſſarie. Yet not beeing able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come others who inſiſted vpon their owne opinions with greater acrimony, &amp; couered themſelues with the buckler of religion, they found a middle way, that a precept ſhould be ſent to <hi>Martin</hi> with a conuenient terme, that ſo it ſhould be reſolued into a citation. Concerning the bookes there was more to doe. The Diuines did thinke they ought to be condemned abſolutely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the doctrine, and the Canoniſts that they ſhould be ioyned with the perſon, and comprehended vnder the terme. It not being poſſible to make an accord herein, they did both the one and the other. For firſt they were condemned for the time preſent, and afterwards a terme alotted to burne them. And with this reſolution a <hi>Bul</hi> was framed vnder the date of the 15. of Iune 1520; Which being, as it were, a beginning and foundation of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> whereof wee are to ſpeake, it is neceſſary to ſet downe <note place="margin">1520</note> here a briefe Epitomic thereof.</p>

From <hi>Chriſt</hi> he turneth to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and praieth him, by the charge which he receiued of our Sauiour, to be carefull of the diſtreſſes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:17208:12"/>
of the Church of Rome, conſecrated with his blood. And paſſing to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> deſireth the like aſſiſtance from him; adding, that, although he hath deemed hereſies to bee neceſſarie for triall of the good, yet it is conuenient to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them in the beginning. Finally, turning himſelfe to all the Saints of heauen, and to the Church vniuerſall, hee prayeth them to intercede with God, that the Church may be purged from ſo great contagion. Then hee proceedeth to ſhew how it came to his knowledge, and how hee hath ſeene with his eyes, that many errors were renewed, which were condemned long before, of <hi>Grecians, Bohemians,</hi> and others, falſe, ſcandalous, apt to offend god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eares, and to deceiue ſimple mindes, ſowed in <hi>Germanie,</hi> alwayes beloued both by him, and by his predeceſſors, who, after the tranſlation of the <hi>Greeke</hi> Empire, haue euer taken their protectors from that nation, and that many pious decrees againſt heretikes haue beene made by thoſe Princes, which the Popes alſo haue confirmed. Therefore that hee, not willing to tolerate the like errors any longer, but rather to make prouiſion againſt them, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite ſome of them: and here he repeateth 42. Articles, which are in the points <note place="margin">The Pope condemneth 42. articles of <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine.</note> of originall ſin, Penance and remiſſion of ſins, of the communion, of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, of Excommunication, of the power of the Pope, of the authoritie of Councels, of good works, of Free-will, of Purgatory, &amp; of pouerty, all which he ſaith are reſpectiuely peſtiferous, pernicious, ſcandalous, offenſiue to pious eares, contrary to charity, contrary to the reuerence which is due to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to obedience, which is the ſinew of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſcipline: wherefore being willing to proceede to ſentence, he, with the Cardinals, genetals of the regular orders; with other Diuines and Doctours, both of the one and the other law, hath made diligent examination of them. Therefore hee condemneth and reiecteth them, reſpectiuely, as hereticall, ſcandalous, falſe, offenſiue to pious eares, deceitfull to godly minds, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Catholike trueth: Hee prohibiteth vpon paine of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and infinite puniſhments, that no man ſhould dare to keepe them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, preach them, or fauour them. And becauſe the ſame aſſertions are found in the bookes of <hi>Martin,</hi> therefore he condemneth them, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> bookes are condemned to the fire.</note> vnder the ſame paines, that none may reade or keepe them, but that they ought to be burned, as well thoſe which doe containe the foreſaid propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as all the reſt. Concerning the perſon of <hi>Martin</hi> himſelfe, he ſaith, he <note place="margin">The Pope gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth an admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and his followers.</note> hath many times admoniſhed, cited, and called him, with promiſe of ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and prouiſion for his iourney; that, if hee had come, hee would not haue found ſo many errours in the Court as hee ſaide, and that himſelfe the Pope would haue taught him, that the Popes his predeceſſors haue neuer er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their conſtitutions. But becauſe he hath endured the cenſures for the ſpace of a whole yeere, and hath dared to appeale vnto a future Councell, a thing prohibited by <hi>Pius,</hi> and <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond, vnder the puniſhments due to heretikes, hee could proceed to condemnation without any more adoe; notwithſtanding, forgetting theſe iniuries, hee admoniſheth the ſaid <hi>Martin,</hi> and his protectors, to change their opinions, ceaſe to preach, and in the terme of 60. dayes, vpon the ſame paines, to reuoke al the foreſaid errors, and burne the bookes; which in caſe they doe not, hee declareth them notorious and obſtinate heretiques. After he commandeth all vnder the ſame paines, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17208:13"/>
they keepe not any booke of the ſame <hi>Martin,</hi> though it conteine not the like errours. Then ordaineth that all men ought to ſhunne as well him as his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourers; yea, commandeth euery one to apprehend them, and bring them perſonally before him, or at leaſt chaſe them out of their Lands and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys: hee interdicteth all places whither they ſhall goe: commandeth that they bee euery where made knowen, and that his Bull ought to bee read in euery place, excommunicating whoſoeuer ſhall hinder the publication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: he determineth that the exemplifications ought to be beleeued, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth that his Bull be publiſhed in <hi>Rome, Brandeburg, Miſna,</hi> and <hi>Manſperg.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Martin Luther</hi> receiuing newes of the condemnation of his doctrine and <note place="margin">The Popes admonition cruſeth <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to make a ſolemne Appeale.</note> bookes, ſet foorth a writing, repeating the Appeale made to the Councell, and making replication thereof for the ſame cauſes. Furthermore, for that the Pope had proceeded againſt a man not called, nor conuinced, nor the controuerſie of the doctrine heard, preferring his owne opinions to the word of God, and leauing no place for the Councell, he offereth to demonſtrate all theſe things, praying the Emperour and all Magiſtrates to accept this his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, for defence of the authority of the Councell, thinking that this decree of the Pope bindeth not any, till the cauſe be lawfully diſcuſſed in a Synod.</p>
            <p>But men of vnderſtanding ſeeing the Bull of <hi>Leo,</hi> marueiled at it for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cauſes. Firſt, concerning the forme, that the Pope ſhould proceede to a <note place="margin">The Bull of <hi>Leo</hi> cenſured:</note> declaration with clauſes of the palace in a matter which ought to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with the words of the holy Scripture; and eſpecially vſing periods ſo intricate, and ſo long and prolixe, that it was ſcarcely poſſible to draw any ſenſe from them, as if he had been to giue ſentence in a feodatary cauſe. And it was particularly noted that one clauſe which ſaith, <hi>Inhibentes omnibus ne praefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos errores aſſerere praeſumant,</hi> is ſo drawen out in length, with ſo many inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and reſtrictions, that betweene <hi>Inhibentes</hi> and <hi>Praeſumant,</hi> there are placed more then foure hundred words.</p>
            <p>Others, paſſing on a little further, conſidered that, to haue propoſed and condemned as hereticall, ſcandalous, falſe, offenſiue to pious eares, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to ſimple minds, 42. propoſitions, without declaring which of them were hereticall, which ſcandalous, which falſe, but onely with a word (reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectiuely) attributing to euery one of them an vncertaine qualitie, cauſed a greater doubt then was before; which was not to define the cauſe but to make it more controuerſed, and to ſhew more plainely, that another autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and wiſedome was neceſſary to determine it.</p>
            <p>Some alſo were filled with admiration, for that it was ſaid, that amongſt the 41. propoſitions there were errours of the Grecians condemned long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe. Others thought it a ſtrange thing, that ſo many propoſitions in diuers points of faith, ſhould be decided in <hi>Rome</hi> by the aduice of the Courtiers onely without participating them to other Biſhops, Academies, and learned perſons of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Vniuerſities of <hi>Louain</hi> and <hi>Collen,</hi> being pleaſed that there was a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour giuen to their ſentence by the Popes Edict, publikely burned the bookes of <hi>Luther.</hi> Which gaue cauſe that he alſo in <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> (all that Schoole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The Popes Bull and the Decretals burned in <hi>Wittenberg.</hi>
               </note> aſſembled) iudicially and publiquely made to be burned, not onely the Bull of <hi>Leo,</hi> but together alſo the Popes Decretals; and after gaue an account
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17208:13"/>
to the world of that action in a long manifeſt, publiſhed in writing, noting <note place="margin">521. LEO 10. CHARLES 5. HENRY 8. FRANCIS 1. A Councell was thought to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for two cauſes.</note> the Papacie in tyrannie of the Church, peruerſeneſſe of Chriſtian doctrine, and vſurpation of the power of lawfull magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>But aſwell for <hi>Luthers</hi> appeale, as for theſe and other conſiderations, euery one became of opinion, that a lawfull Councell was neceſſarie, by which, not onely the controuerſies might bee decided, but the abuſes alſo, long ſince brought into the Church, might bee redreſſed; and alwayes the neceſsitie hereof appeared the more, by how much the more the contentions increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, writings being ſet forth continually, both by the one part, and the other. For <hi>Martin</hi> failed not to confirme his doctrine by diuers writings, and, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as he ſtudied, hee diſcouered more light, euer paſsing ſome ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forward, and finding articles, of which in the beginning hee had not thought: Which hee ſayd he did for the zeale of the Houſe of God. But hee was conſtrained alſo by neceſsitie. For the Romaniſts hauing laboured ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually in <hi>Collen</hi> with the Elector of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> by the mediation of <hi>Hierom Aleander,</hi> that he would deliuer <hi>Martin</hi> priſoner to the Pope, or by ſome other meanes to procure his death, he ſaw that he was obliged to ſhew vnto that Prince, and to the people of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> and euery one elſe, that he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on his ſide, that neither hee nor any other potentate, might yeelde to the earneſt intreaties of the Romaniſts, made againſt his life.</p>
            <p>The yeere 1520, being thus paſſed, the diet of <hi>Wormes,</hi> of the yeere 1521. <note place="margin">1521. <hi>Luther</hi> called to the Diet.</note> was celebrated in <hi>Germanie;</hi> to which <hi>Luther</hi> was called to render an account of his doctrine, and had giuen vnto him a ſafe conduct by the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> elected two yeeres before. He was counſelled not to goe thither, ſeeing that the ſentence of his condemnation made by <hi>Leo</hi> was publiſhed before, and hanged vp; whereby he might aſſure himſelfe to bring backe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a confirmation of his doome, if peraduenture no worſe thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto him. Notwithſtanding himſelfe thought the contrary, againſt the opinion of al his friends, and ſaid, that though he were ſure to haue to doe againſt as many deuils as there were tiles in the roofes of the houſes of that citie, he would goe thither.</p>
            <p>And in that place, the ſeuenteenth of Aprill, hee was demaunded by the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated in the Diet.</note> Emperour and the whole aſſembly of the Princes, if hee were Authour of the Bookes which went abroad vnder his name, the Titles whereof were recited, and the copies, placed in the midſt of the roome where they ſate, were ſhewed vnto him; and whether he would defend whatſoeuer was contained in them, or retract ſomething. His anſwer was that, concerning the books, he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be his; but to reſolue whether to maintaine the things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in them, or not, was a matter of great moment, &amp; therfore required ſome time of deliberation. There was granted him time that day, to giue his anſwere the next: Which being come, <hi>Martin,</hi> brought into the aſſembly, made a long ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note place="margin">Anſwereth.</note> Firſt, he excuſed his ſimplicitie, if, bred after a priuate &amp; ſimple maner, he had not vſed tearmes according to the dignitie of that place, and giuen to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one conuenient titles; then he confirmed that he acknowledged the books for his owne. And concerning the defence of them, hee ſaid they were not all of one ſort, but ſome contained doctrine of Faith and Pietie, others reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Doctrine of the Romaniſts, and a third kinde was of thoſe which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17208:14"/>
were written contentiouſly, againſt the defenders of the contrarie doctrine. For the firſt, he ſaid he were no Chriſtian or honeſt man if he ſhould retract them; the rather, becauſe though all were condemned, yet all were not iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged naught by the ſame Bull of <hi>Leo.</hi> For the ſecond, that it was too manifeſt, that all the Countryes of Chriſtendome were oppreſſed and groaned vnder the bondage. And therefore to retract the things alreadie ſpoken would bee nothing elſe but to confirme that tyrannie. In the bookes of the third kinde, he confeſſed hee was more bitter and vehement then hee ought, excuſing himſelfe that hee made not profeſſion of Sanctitie, nor would maintaine his owne manners, but his doctrine onely; whereof hee was readie to giue an account to any man whatſoeuer, promiſing not to be obſtinate, but to caſt his books into the fire himſelfe, in caſe any errour were ſhewed him with the Scripture in hand. Hee turned himſelfe to the Emperour, and the Princes, ſaying, it was a bleſſing of God when the true doctrine came to be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, as to reiect it, was to draw vpon vs a cauſe of extreame calamities.</p>
            <p>His Oration being ended, he was by order required by the Emperour to giue a plaine and ſimple anſwere, whether or no he would maintaine his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> refuſeth to retract any thing.</note> Whereunto he anſwered that hee could not reuoke any thing that hee had written or taught, if he were not conuinced by the words of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or by euident reaſons.</p>
            <p>The Emperour hearing theſe things, reſolued, following the ſteps of his predeceſſours, to maintaine the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to vſe all meanes to quench that fire. Howbeit hee would not violate the faith giuen, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime a baniſhment againſt <hi>Martin</hi> after hee was ſafely returned to his houſe. Some of the aſſembly approouing that which was done at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> ſaid <note place="margin">A noble reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Prince Elector Palatine.</note> that the faith ought not to be kept. But <hi>Lewis</hi> Count Elector Palatine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelfe, as vnto a thing which would brand the German name with a marke of perpetuall ignominie, expreſſing with diſdaine, that it was intole-Rable, that for the ſeruice of Prieſts, <hi>Germanie</hi> ſhould draw vpon it ſelfe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie of not keeping the publique faith. Some there were alſo that ſaid that there was no neede to proceede ſo faſt to condemnation, becauſe it was a matter of great moment, and which might produce great conſequences.</p>
            <p>The dayes following there was a treatie in preſence of ſome of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in particular, of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Triers,</hi> and of <hi>Ioachimus</hi> Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> &amp; many things were ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by <hi>Martin</hi> in defence of that doctrine and by others againſt it, being deſirous to induce him to referre euery thing to the iudgement of the Emperor, and of the aſſembly, &amp; of the Diet, without any condition whatſoeuer. But he anſwering that the Prophet forbade to put our confidence in men, yea euen in Princes, to whoſe iudgment, nothing ought leſſe to bee committed then the word of God, it was at laſt propoſed that hee would ſubmit all to the iudgment of the future Councell, whereunto <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe to a generall Councell.</note> he agreed, with condition, that firſt the articles, which he intended to referre, might be drawen out of his bookes: and that ſentence might not be giuen of them but according to the Scriptures. Laſt of all, being demanded what reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies he thought might be vſed in this cauſe? he anſwered, thoſe onely which were propoſed to the Iewes by <hi>Gamaliel;</hi> that is, that if the enterprize were of man it would vaniſh, but if it came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, it was impoſſible to hinder it; and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17208:14"/>
that it might giue ſatisfaction to the Pope, becauſe all men ought to reſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure (as himſelfe did) that if his deſeigne came not from God, it would periſh in a ſhort time. From which things it being impoſſible to remoue him, and ſtanding firme in his reſolution, not to accept any iudgement but vnder the rule of the ſcripture, he had leaue giuen him to depart, and a terme of 21 daies aſſigned him to returne to his home, with condition that hee ſhould neither preach nor write any thing in his iourney. For which, after hee had giuen thankes, he departed the 26. of April.</p>
            <p n="43">43 Afterwards <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour publiſhed an Edict in the ſame Diet <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Edict againſt <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </note> at <hi>Wormes,</hi> the 8. of April. In which, hauing firſt declared, that it belonged to the duty of the Emperour to aduance Religion, and to extinguiſh hereſies, which began to ſpring vp, he proceeded on to ſhew that Friar <hi>Martine Luther</hi> endeauoured to ſtaine <hi>Germanie</hi> with that contagion, ſo that, if he were not hindered, all that nation would fall into an horrible ruine; that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> had fatherly admoniſhed him, and, after that, the aſſembly of Cardinals, and other excellent men, had condemned his writings, and declared him an Heretique, if within a certaine terme he reuoked not his errours; and had ſent by <hi>Ierom Aleander,</hi> his Nuncio, a copie of that Bull of condemnation to him the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as protectour of the Church, deſiring him it might bee put in execution in the Empire, his Kingdomes, Dominions and Prouinces; that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this, <hi>Martin</hi> amended not himſelfe, yea multiplied his Bookes daily, full, not onely of new hereſies, but euen of thoſe which haue been long ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by holy Councels, and not only in the Latine tongue, but in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man alſo, naming in particular many of his errours; he concluded that there was no writing of his where there was not to bee found ſome contagion or deadly ſting, ſo that it might be ſaid, that euery word was a poyſon; that theſe things being conſidered by him the Emperour, and his Counſellours of all nations ſubiect vnto him, treading in the ſteps of the Romane Emperours his predeceſſours, hauing conferred, in that Diet of <hi>Wormes,</hi> with the Electors, and men of other States of the Empire, by their counſell and aſſent, (though it was not fit to heare a man condemned by the Pope, obſtinate in his peruerſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and a notorious Heretique notwithſtanding, to take away all occaſion of cauill, many ſaying it was neceſſary to heare the man before the Popes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was executed) he reſolued to ſend to fetch him by one of his Heraulds, not to know and iudge the things that concerne faith, which belongeth to the Pope alone, but to bring him to the right way with good perſwaſions. Then hee ſhewed how <hi>Martin</hi> was brought into the publique aſſembly, and whereof he was interrogated, and what he anſwered, as it hath beene decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before, and how he had leaue giuen him, and departed.</p>
            <p n="44">44 Afterwards he goeth on, concluding that therefore for the honour of God, and reuerence of the Pope, and for the duty of the Imperiall dignity, by the counſell and aſſent of the Princes, Electors, and States, executing the ſentence and condemnation of the Pope, he declared that hee holdeth <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther</hi> for a notorious Heretique, and determineth that hee ought to be ſo held of men, prohibiting euery one to receiue or defend him in any ſort, commanding both Princes and States, vnder all the penalties, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and take him after the terme of twenty dayes, and alſo to proſecute all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17208:15"/>
his complices, adherents, and fauourers, ſpoyling them of all their goods mooueable and immooueable. Hee commandeth alſo that no man ſhould reade or keepe his books, notwithſtanding that ſome thing be good in them, giuing order as well to Princes, as others that adminiſter Iuſtice, that they, burne and deſtroy them. And becauſe books extracted out of his workes are compoſed and printed in ſome places, and pictures and images ſpread abroad to the diſgrace of many, yea, euen of the Pope himſelfe, he commandeth that none ſhould print, paint, or keep any of them, but that they be taken and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Magiſtrates, and the Printers, buyers and ſellers puniſhed, adding a generall law, that no writing may be printed where any point of faith is handled, though the leaſt of all, without conſent of the Ordinary.</p>
            <p n="45">45 In this ſelfe ſame time alſo the Vniuerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> drawing diuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions from the bookes of <hi>Luther,</hi> condemned them, partly as renewed out <note place="margin">The Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>Paris</hi> condemned the writings of <hi>Luther.</hi>

But all theſe oppoſitions effected nothing elſe, but that <hi>Luther</hi> anſwering, bookes were multiplyed both of the one ſide and the other, and the contentions waxed more ſharpe, and the curioſity of many was ſtirred vp, who, willing to informe themſelues of the ſtate of the controuerſie, came to note the errours reprehended, and ſo withdrew their deuotion from the Pope.</p>
            <p n="46">46 Amongſt the moſt famous contradictors, which the doctrine of <hi>Luther</hi> found, was <hi>Henry</hi> 8. King of <hi>England,</hi> who not being borne the Kings eldeſt <note place="margin">

This Kingly tittle being entred into the controuerſies made men more curious, and, as it happeneth in combats, that the lookers on are alwayes ready to fauour the weaker, and to extoll his actions, though they bee but meanes, ſo ſo heere it ſtirred vp a generall inclination towards <hi>Luther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="47">47 So ſoone as the Emperours decree of baniſhment was publiſhed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout, the ſame month <hi>Hugo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> in whoſe Dioceſſe is the <note place="margin">The B. of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> wrot to <hi>Zurie</hi> againſt Zuinglius.</note> Citty of <hi>Zuric,</hi> wrot to the Colledge of the Canons of that place, of which number <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was one, and another letter to the Senate of the ſame City.

He ſent there withall the Decree of <hi>Leo,</hi> and the baniſhment publiſhed by the

Emperour, exhorting them to receiue and obey both the one and the other, and particularly noted the perſon and doctrine of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and his adherents, which conſtrained him to giue an account of whatſoeuer he had taught his Collegues, and to ſatisfie the Senate. Hee wrot alſo to the Biſhop, inſiſting principally vpon this, that concubinarie Prieſts were not any more to bee tolerated, from whom ſprang infamy to the Clergy, and bad example to the people, and generally corruption of manners in all; a thing which could not be taken away, but by bringing in of marriage, according to the Apoſtles doctrine. Hee wrot alſo to all the Cantons of the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> in his owne defence, making particular mention of an Edict made by the Magiſtrates their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, that euery Prieſt ſhould bee bound to haue his proper concubine, that hee might not enſnare the chaſtity of honeſt women; adding that though it ſeemed a ridiculous decree, yet it was neceſſarily to be made, nor could bee changed, vnleſſe that as much as was conſtituted in fauour of keeping Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, were at that preſent conuerted vnto lawfull matrimony.</p>
            <p n="48">48 The ſtirring of the Biſhop induced the Dominicans to preach againſt <note place="margin">The Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans preach againſt <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius,</hi> whereby he is ſtirred vp the more.</note> the doctrine of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and him to defend himſelfe. Wherefore he wrote and publiſhed 67. concluſions, which contained his doctrine, and touched the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Clergy, and of the Prelats. Whereupon much confuſion and diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ariſing, the Senate of <hi>Zuric</hi> began to conſult how to appeaſe the tumults, and called together all the Preachers and Doctors of their iuriſdiction. They inuited alſo the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtance</hi> to ſend ſome man of wiſedome and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to aſſiſt at that conference, to the end they might pacifie the troubles, and order ſome thing which might bee for the glory of God.

After many things were ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by diuers Dominican Friars, and other Doctors againſt <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and by him anſwered, <hi>Faber</hi> ſaid, that that time and place were not fit to treate of ſuch a matter, &amp; that the diſcuſſing of ſuch propoſitions belonged to the Councell, which would be called very ſoon: for he ſaid, the Pope had ſo agreed with the Princes, and greater Magiſtrates, and Prelates of Chriſtendome. Which gaue ſubiect to <hi>Zuinglius</hi> to fortifie himſelfe, ſaying, that theſe promiſes were made to feede the people with vaine hopes, and in the meane ſpace to lull them aſleepe in ignorance; that the things which were certaine and cleere in the holy Scripture, and in the vſe of the Primitiue Church, might very well bee handled at that time, though they expected a more exact declaration from the Councell, of the points that were doubtfull; and alwayes vrging him to ſay what he could, againſt his concluſions, <hi>Faber</hi> told him that hee would not <note place="margin">Who will not anſwere in words, but in writing.</note> treat with him in words, but would anſwere his concluſions in writing.

            <p n="49">49 It being therefore perceiued, that the labours of the Doctours and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popes decree, who proceeded to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute condemnation, and the Emperours <hi>Bando,</hi> ſo ſeuere, not onely could
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17208:16"/>
not extinguiſh the new doctrine, but that notwithſtanding it made euery day a greater progreſſe, euery one beganne to thinke that theſe medicines were not proper for ſuch a malady, and that in concluſion it was neceſſary to come to ſuch a kinde of remedy, which, being vſed in times paſt in the like occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſeemed had appeaſed all troubles, which was the celebration of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. Wherefore this was deſired by all ſorts of men, as a wholeſome and the <note place="margin">A generall Councell was thought to bee neceſſary.</note> onely remedy.</p>
            <p n="50">50 It came to be conſidered, that theſe nouelties had not had any other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning but from the abuſes which time brought in, and from the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Paſtors; and therefore that it was impoſſible to remedy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions ſprung vp, but by remedying the abuſes which cauſed them; and that there was no other way to prouide againſt them, with concord and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity, but by an vniuerſall Congregation. And this was the diſcourſe of godly and well diſpoſed men. Notwithſtanding there wanted not diuers ſorts of perſons, who thought the Councell would be profitable for their ends, and deſired it ſhould be regulated with ſuch conditions, that it could <note place="margin">Diuers ſorts of perſons deſire the Councell for diuers ends.</note> not be but in their fauour, and not contrary to their intereſts. Firſt, thoſe that had embraced <hi>Luthers</hi> opinions deſired the Councell, with condition that therein all might be decided and gouerned by the Scripture, all the Pope his conſtitutions and ſchoole learning being excluded: For ſo they aſſured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, not onely to defend their owne doctrine, but alſo that onely theirs ſhould be approoued. But a Councell that ſhould proceed, as the vſe was 800. yeeres before, they would not, and would be vnderſtood that they referred not themſelues to that cenſure. And <hi>Martin</hi> was vſed to ſay, that in <hi>Wormes</hi> hee was too faint hearted, and that he was ſo well aſſured of his doctrine, that it being diuine, he would not ſubmit it ſo much as to the iudgement of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; yea, that with it he was to iudge all, both men and Angels. The Princes and other gouernors of the Countreys regarded not much what the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell might determine concerning doctriens, but deſired it might bee ſuch a one as might reduce the Prieſts and Friars to their beginning, hoping that, by that meanes the regalities, and temporall iuriſdictions would returne vnto them, which, in ſuch abundance and plenty, were paſſed into the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call order. And therefore they ſaid, that it was in vaine to call a Councell, where the Biſhops and other Prelates onely ſhould haue a deliberatiue voyce, becauſe they ought to bee reformed, and it was neceſſary that others ſhould haue the charge thereof, who could not be deceiued by their proper intereſts, nor conſtrained to reſolue againſt the common good of Chriſtendome. The meaner ſort, though they had not much knowledge of the affaires of the world, deſired that the Eccleſiaſticall authority might be moderated, and the poore people not burthened with ſo many exactions, vnder pretence of Tithes, Almes, and Indulgences, nor oppreſſed by the Biſhops Officials, vnder colour of corrections, and ſentences. The Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the moſt principall part, deſired the Councell, that it mighe reſtore obedience to the Pope, which was taken from him, &amp; approued ſuch a one as might be gouerned according to the formes vſed in the laſt ages. But that it ſhould haue power to reforme the Papacy, and to take away thoſe introductions, from which the Court re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſo many emoluments, and by which a great part of the gold of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17208:16"/>
was glued together in <hi>Rome,</hi> this pleaſed them not. <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it were, in a ſtrait betweene both the parties, knew not what to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. <note place="margin">1522 ADRIAN 6.

Hee conſidered with himſelfe how to call a Councell in <hi>Rome,</hi> or ſome other place of the Churches dominion; as his Predeceſſor and himſelfe had celebrated with ſingular fruit, the Councell of Lateran a few yeeres before, hauing by that meanes appeaſed the ſchiſme, reduced the kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> which was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and, which was of no leſſe importance, aboliſhed the Prgamaticall San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, doubly contrary to the monarchy of <hi>Rome;</hi> as well in regard it was an example to take from him the collation of benefices, a great foundation of the Pontificall greatneſſe, as alſo becauſe it was a preſeruation of the memory of the Councell of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and by conſequence of the ſubiection of the Pope to a generall Synode. But afterwards hee ſaw not how a Councell of that ſort could giue remedy to the diſeaſe, which was not in the Princes and great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, with whom familiarity and intereſt preuailed, but in the people, with whom it was neceſſary to vſe reality, and to make a true mutation.

exhauſted and in extreame confuſion, during the anarchy of eight moneths. Notwithſtanding hee applied himſelfe principally to compoſe the diſcords in religion in <hi>Germany.</hi> And being nouriſhed and brought vp from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in the ſtudies of School-Diuinity, he held thoſe opinions to be ſo cleare and euident, that he was perſwaded that no reaſonable man could thinke the contrary.

               </note> fooliſh, and vnreaſonable, and thought that none, but ſome fewe fooles, could beleeue it, and that thoſe that followed <hi>Martin</hi> were men, who, in their conſcience, vndoubtedly maintained the opinions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and fained the contrary, beeing prouoked by the burthens layd vpon them. His opinion therefore was, that it muſt needes bee an eaſie thing to extinguiſh that doctrine, which had none other foundation then matter of profite, and thought that, by giuing ſome ſmall ſatisfaction, the body would eaſily bee healed, which rather made ſhew to bee ſicke, then that it was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. <note place="margin">Adrian <hi>borne in</hi> Vtrect.</note> And becauſe he was borne in <hi>Vtrect,</hi> a city of low <hi>Germanie,</hi> hee hoped that all that nation would willingly hearken to his propoſes, and ingage themſelues to maintaine his authority, as being an <hi>Alman,</hi> and ſo ſincere in all his treaties, that he vſed neither Arts nor ſecret ends.

               </note> might be gratefully heard, and his promiſe eſteemed reall, he thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to giue a taſte, by beginning a reformation, before hee treated with them, remoouing the abuſes which cauſed the diſſention. To this ende hee called to <hi>Rome, Iohn Peter Caraffa,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Chieti,</hi> and <hi>Marcellus Cazele</hi> of <hi>Gaeta,</hi> men eſteemed for their honeſty and vertues, and very skilfull in whatſoeuer belonged to Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, that by the counſell of them, and of the Cardinals which he truſted, hee might finde ſome remedy againſt the corruptions which were of greateſt moment. In this number the prodigality vſed in giuing Indulgences firſt preſented it ſelfe vnto him, becauſe it gaue way to the reputation which the new Preachers in <hi>Germany,</hi> had gained.</p>
            <p n="53">53 The Pope, being a Diuine who had written in this matter long before <hi>Luther</hi> thought to handle it, meant to eſtabliſh by an Apoſtolicall Decree, and as Pope, that doctrine which, being a priuate man, he had taught and written. That is, that an Indulgence being granted to one that ſhall doe ſuch a godly worke, the worke may be performed by ſome in ſuch perfection, that he may obtaine the Indulgence; but if it want ſomething of that exactneſſe, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker obtaineth not all the Indulgence, but onely ſo much as anſwereth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the imperfect worke. The Pope thought that by this meanes hee ſhould not onely prouide againſt ſcandall hereafter, but remedy alſo thoſe that were paſt, becauſe it being poſſible to qualifie with ſo good circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces euery little worke, that it may deſerue any great reward, <hi>Luthers</hi> obiection was anſwered, how by the offering of a penny ſo great a treaſure could bee gained; and ſeeing that by the defect of the worke, he that gaineth not all, obtaineth notwithſtanding a proportionable part, the faithfull drewe not themſelues backe from ſeeking Indulgences.</p>
            <p n="54">54 But Friar <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Gaeta,</hi> Cardinall of S. <hi>Siſtus,</hi> a perfect Diuine, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17208:17"/>
it, telling him, that this was to puniſh that truth, which, for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſoules, it was better to keepe ſecret amongſt learned men, and that it was rather diſputable then decided. Therefore, that himſelfe alſo, who ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly beleeued it in his conſcience, notwithſtanding had ſo carried it in his writings, that none but the moſt learned men could draw it from his words: which doctrine beeing divulged and authorized, there would be danger, that <note place="margin">Card. <hi>Caietan</hi> diſſwaded the Pope from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a decree concerning Indulgences.</note> euen learned men would conclude, that the Popes grant profited nothing, but that all oughtt to be attributed to the quality of the worke, which would abſolutely diminiſh mens hote deſires to purchaſe Indulgences, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of the Popes authority. The Cardinall added that, after hee had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſtudied this ſubiect, by the command of <hi>Leo,</hi> at the time when theſe contentions began in <hi>Germanie,</hi> and written a full tract thereof, being Legat in <hi>Ausburg,</hi> the next yeare he had occaſion to examine and treat of it more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, ſpeaking with many, and diſcuſſing the difficulties and motiues which troubled thoſe Countryes: and in two conferences which hee had with <hi>Luther</hi> in that City, he diſputed that matter at large, which hauing well digeſted, he doubted not but that he might ſay with aſſeueration &amp; without danger of errour, that there was no other way to giue remedy to the ſcandals paſt, preſent, and to come, then by bringing backe thoſe things to their firſt beginning. That it is a cleare caſe, that, howſoeuer the Pope may free the faithfull from any puniſhment, by the meanes of Indulgences, yet to him that readeth the Decretals it plainely appeareth, that an Indulgence is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution from penance impoſed in confeſſion onely. Wherefore cauſing the diſuſed penitentiary Canons to be obſerued again, and impoſing conuenient penance, euery one would euidently ſee the neceſſity and vtility of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, and would earneſtly ſeeke them, to free themſelues from that great burthen of penance; and the golden age of the Primitiue Church would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe, in which the P relates had abſolute command ouer the faithful, onely becauſe they were held in continuall exerciſe with penance; whereas now, being become wanton, they would ſhake off from them the yoke of obedience. The people of <hi>Germanie,</hi> who buried in idlenes, giue care to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> for preaching Chriſtian liberty, if they were curbed with penances, would thinke no more of this innouation, and the Apoſtolical Sea might fauour therein whoſoeuer would be thankefull to it in that behalfe.</p>
            <p n="55">55 This opinion pleaſed the Pope, as grounded vpon authority, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he ſaw not what oppoſition could be made. He cauſed it to be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">Who was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to imbrace his opinion.</note> in the Penitentiarie Court, to finde a meanes and forme how to put it in practiſe firſt in <hi>Rome,</hi> and then in all Chriſtendome. For this cauſe diuers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies were made by the deputies for the reformation, together with the Penitentiaries, to treat of the manner how to vſe it. But ſo many difficulties did croſſe it, that in concluſion <hi>Lorenzo Puccio,</hi> a Florentine, Cardinall of <hi>Santi Quatro,</hi> who was Datarie to Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and (as hath been ſaid) a diligent mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <note place="margin">But was diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Lorenzo Puccio.</hi>
               </note> to find out money, and was now chiefe Penitentiary, related to the Pope, with a generall aſſent, that the propoſition was thought impoſſible, and that, when proofe thereof ſhould be made, in ſtead of curing the preſent diſeaſes, farre geater would be ſtirred vp. That the Canonicall puniſhments were grown into diſuſe, becauſe they could no longer be ſupported for want of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17208:18"/>
ancient zeale. Wherefore for him that would bring them backe, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary he ſhould make the ſame zeale and Charity in the Church to returne againe. That this preſentage was not like vnto thoſe that were paſt, in which all the Conſtitutions of the Church were receiued, without thinking any more of them, whereas now euery one will be a iudge, and examine the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Which, if it happen in things that bring with them no burden at all, or very little, how much more muſt it be expected in a thing that would bee moſt heauy. It was true, that the remedie was fitted for the diſeaſe, but that it was too ſtrong for the body that was ſicke, and inſteed of curing would kill it, and that in place of regaining <hi>Germany, Italy</hi> would firſt bee loſt, and that eſtranged much more. The Cardinall added, mee thinkes I heare one ſay, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> did, Why do they tempt God laying vpon the Diſciples ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that, which neither we nor our fathers haue been able to beare. That his Holynes ſhould remember that famous place of the Gloſſe, alleadged by him in his fourth booke vpon the Sentences, that, concerning the value of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, the complaint is both old and doubtfull; That hee ſhould conſider the foure Opinions, all Catholique, and yet ſo different as that Gloſſe doth <note place="margin">Fowre very different opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about Indulgences, and all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique.</note> recite. Whereby it is manifeſt, that this matter in theſe times requireth ſilence rather then any further diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p n="56">56 Theſe reaſons ſanke deepe into <hi>Adrians</hi> mind, and made him not know what to doe, and hee was perplexed ſo much the more, becauſe he found no leſſe difficulty in other things, which, in his ſecret purpoſe, hee meaned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. In the matter of diſpenſations for marriage, the taking away of many prohibitions againſt contracting matrimony betweene certaine perſons, which ſeemed ſuperfluous, and hard to bee obſerued (whereunto hee was much inclined, and it would haue beene a great eaſe to the people) was bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by many, as a thing that weakened the ſinewes of diſcipline, and the continuing of them made the Lutherans ſay, that they were onely to get money. To reſtraine the diſpenſations to certaine qualities of perſons, was to giue new matter to the pretendants to alleadge that in ſpirituall things, and in whatſoeuer belonged to the miniſtery of CHRIST, there was no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of perſons. To take away pecuniary expences for theſe things, that could not be, but by rebuying the Offices which <hi>Leo</hi> ſold, the buyers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were gainers by this. Which alſo hindered the aboliſhing of <hi>Regreſſes, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,</hi> and <hi>Coadiutories,</hi> and other deuices vſed in the collation of Benefices, which had the appearance (if not rather the eſſence) of Simony. To rebuy the Offices was impoſſible, in regard of the great charges which muſt bee made, and alwayes continued. And that which moſt troubled his mind was, that when he was reſolued to take away any abuſe, there wanted not ſome, who tooke vpon him to maintaine with colourable ſhew, that the thing was good or neceſſary. With theſe doubts the Pope was grieued vntill Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, deſirous to make ſome notable prouiſion, to giue the world a taſte of his minde, who was reſolute to remedy all the abuſes, before hee began to treat in <hi>Germany.</hi>

Hee commended his goodneſſe, his ingenuity and his minde inclined to the reformation of the Church, and the rooting out of hereſies: adding, notwithſtanding, that hee could not haue praiſe by his good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely, not able to doe good by it ſelfe, vnleſſe hee ioyned thereunto an exact choyce of fit meanes, and an execution managed with the greateſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection. But when hee ſaw him conſtrained by the ſtraitneſſe of time to reſolue, hee told him there was no hope to confound and roote out the Lutherans by correcting the manners of the Court, but rather that it would bee a meanes to augment their credit much more. For the people, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes iudge by the euents, when they ſhall bee aſſured, by the following a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, that the Popes gouernment was iuſtly reprehonded, wil perſwade themſelues likewiſe, that the other innouations propoſed haue good founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the arch-heretiques, ſeeing they haue ouercome in one part, will not ceaſe to reprehend the reſt. That in all humane affaires it falleth out, that to receiue ſatisfaction in ſome requeſts, giueth pretence to prepare more, and to thinke they are due. That reading the ſtories paſt of the times, when he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſies haue beene raiſed againſt the authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> it will appeare, that all tooke pretence from the corrupted manners of the Court. Neuertheleſſe, neuer any Pope thought fit to reforme them, but after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and inſtructions vſed, to induce the Princes to protect the Church. That, whatſoeuer hath ſucceeded well here to fore, ought alwayes to bee obſerued and kept. That nothing did more ruine a gouernment, then to change the manner of ruling it. That to open new wayes not vſed was to expoſe himſelfe to great dangers, and that it was moſt ſecure to tread in the ſteps of the holy Popes, who alwayes haue brought their enterpriſes to a proſperous end. That no man hath euer extinguiſhed hereſies by refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, but by Cruſadoes, and by exciting Princes and people to roote them out. That he ſhould remember that <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, did by ſuch meanes happily oppreſſe the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> of <hi>Langue doc,</hi> and the next Popes extinguiſhed in other places, and by no other means, the <hi>Waldenſes, Picards,</hi> poore people of <hi>Lions, Arnaldiſts, Speroniſts,</hi> and <hi>Patauines,</hi> ſo that now there remaineth no more of them but the name onely. That there would not want Princes in <hi>Germanie,</hi> who, in caſe the Pope would giue them leaue to ſeaze themſelues of the States of <hi>Luthers</hi> fauourers, would greedily embrace the condition; and that hee might cauſe many people to follow them, by granting Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences and Pardons to whoſoeuer would aſſiſt them. The Cardinall put him alſo in minde, that he ought not to thinke of the Germane ſtirres in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as if there were no more imminent danger to the Apoſtolicall Sea; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the warre of <hi>Italy,</hi> a thing of greater perill, hanged ouer their heads, whereunto he ought principally to apply his mind: in managing whereof, if he wanted money, which is the ſinew of warre, hee might receiue ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious affront; and that no reformation could bee made, that would not notably diminiſh the rents of the Church; which hauing foure fountaines, the one temporall, the rents of the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, the other three ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,

            <p>The Pope relating theſe diſcourſes to <hi>William Encourt,</hi> whom afterward he created Cardinall, and <hi>Theodorie Hezius,</hi> his familiar and truſtie friends, ſayd the condition of Popes was miſerable, ſeeing it was plaine that they could not doe good, though they deſired and indeauoured to doe it, and concluded <note place="margin">

Neuertheleſſe hee gaue ſtrait commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to both, of which one was Dataric, and the other Secretarie, that they ſhould be ſparing to grant Indulgences, diſpenſations, regreſſes, and coadiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, vntill meanes were found to giue a rule for them by a Law and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Conſtitution. Theſe things, hauing read them largely related in a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Biſhop of <hi>Fabriano,</hi> where he noted all the remarkeable things which hee had ſeene and heard, I was willing briefely to repeate here, becauſe they may ſerue much to the vnderſtanding of thoſe things which ſhall be ſpoken of hereafter.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Conſiſtorie of Nouember, by conſent of the Cardinalls, hee appointed <hi>Franceſco Chiericato,</hi> whom he knew in <hi>Spaine,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Fabriano</hi> (whom I named a little before) for his Nuncio to the Diet of <hi>Noremberg,</hi>

               </note> Orators of Cities, written generally to them all, vnder the date of the fiue and twentieth of <hi>Nouember;</hi> in which hee firſt complained that <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> hauing beene condemned by the ſentence of <hi>Leo,</hi> and the ſentence executed in <hi>Wormes</hi> by the Emperours Decree, publiſhed thoughout all <hi>Germany,</hi> hee perſeuered notwithſtanding in the ſame errours, continually publiſhing bookes full of hereſies, and that he was fauoured, not onely by the meaner ſort, but euen by the Nobles alſo.

ſome abominations haue beene committed euen in that holy Sea, many abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in ſpirituall things, many tranſgreſſions of the commandements, and laſtly, all things turned to the worſt, ſo that it may be ſaid, that the infirmity is paſſed from the head to the members, from the Popes to the inferiour Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, in ſo much, that there hath beene none that hath done good, no not one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the amendment of which euil, himſelfe is reſolued to imploy all his wits, and vſe all diligence that the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence peraduenture all this miſchiefe proceeded, ſhould be reformed firſt of all.

            <p n="61">61 The Diet anſwered the Nuncio in writing, that with reuerence they had read the Popes Briefe, and the inſtructions concerning <hi>Luthers</hi> ſect, and that <note place="margin">The anſwere of the Diet.</note> they gaue thankes to God for his Holyneſſe aſſumption to the Popedome, wiſhing him all happyneſſe from aboue. And (when they had ſpoken what came into their minds about the concord betweene Chriſtian Princes, and the warre againſt the Turkes) concerning the demand to execute the Sentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> and the Edict of <hi>Wormes,</hi> they anſwered that they were moſt ready to imploy all their power to roote out hereſies, but that they had omitted to execute the Sentence, and Edict, for moſt weighty and vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent cauſes, in regard that the greater part of the people was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Luthers</hi> bookes that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had brought many grieuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon <hi>Germany;</hi> ſo that if any thing had beene done for execution of the Sentence, the multitude would haue entered into ſuſpition that it was done to vphold and mainetaine the abuſes and impiety, and popular tumults would haue beene raiſed with danger of ciuill warres. Wherefore they ſayd, that in ſuch difficulties, more fitting remedies were neceſſary; eſpecially himſelfe the Nuncio hauing confeſſed in the Popes name that theſe euills proceeded from the ſinnes of men, and promiſed a reformation of the Court of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the Eccleſiaſtiques and Seculars, and to extirpate the preſent tumults. And becauſe <hi>Germany</hi> had conſented to the paiment of Annates, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they ſhould be ſpent in the warre againſt the Turkes, they being payd ſo many yeares, and neuer conuerted to that vſe, they deſired the Pope, that from hencefoorth the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> might not be troubled to exact them, but that they might be left to the Exchequer of the Empire for the expences of that warre.

Which, they thinking that his Holineſſe ought ſpeedily to execute, and being deſirous to make, for the interim, the beſt prouiſion they were able, they were reſolued to treat with the Elector of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> that the Lutherans ſhould neither write not print any more, &amp; that the preachers throughout all <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> ſhould be ſilent in thoſe things that might cauſe popular tumult, &amp; ſhould preach the holy Goſpel ſincerely and purely, according to the doctrine appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Church, not mouing diſputations, but reſeruing all controuerſies to the determination of the Councell. That the Biſhops ſhould depute godly and learned men to be ſuperintendents ouer the preachers, to informe &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them; yet ſo, as that no ſuſpition might be giuen that it was done to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the truth of the Goſpel; that hereafter no new thing ſhould be printed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were ſeen &amp; allowed, by honeſt &amp; learned men. Hoping by this means to prouide againſt the tumults, if his Holines will take order againſt the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uances, and ordaine a free and Chriſtian Councell; not doubting but that the tumults will ſo be quieted, and the greater part reduced to tranquillity. For vndoubtedly all honeſt men would expect the determination of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, when they ſaw that it was to bee celebrated quickly. Concerning mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Prieſts, and religious men, who returned to the world, they thought it ſufficient if the Ordinaries did impoſe vpon them Canonicall puniſhments, becauſe the Ciuill Lawes had made no prouiſion againſt them: But in caſe they commit any wickedneſſe, that the Prince, or Magiſtrate, in whoſe Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory they ſhall offend, ought to giue them their due chaſtiſement.</p>

               </note> And firſt for the cauſe why the Popes ſentence, and the Emperours Edict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Luther</hi> were not executed, he ſayd, that the reaſon alleadged did not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie, which was, that they refrained to doe it, to auoyd ſcandals. For it was not conuenient to tolerate an euill, that good may come thereby, and that they ought to eſteeme more the ſaluation of ſoules, then worldly tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

And if <hi>Germany</hi> were any way bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Apoſtolicall Sea would bee ready to eaſe it. And if there were any differences betweene the Eccleſiaſtiques, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Princes, the Pope was willing to compoſe and extinguiſh them. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Annates, then he ſaid nothing, for that his Holineſſe would anſwere them in time conuenient. But to their demand of a Councell, he replied, that his hope was, that it would not diſpleaſe his Holineſſe, if they had demanded it in more fitting termes, and therefore beſought them to take away all thoſe words that might giue him any <hi>vmbrage.</hi> As thoſe, that the Councell might be called by the Emperours conſent; and thoſe other, that the Councell might be Celebrated rather in one Citie then another. For if they were not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it ſeemed they would binde his Holineſſe hands, a thing which could not produce any good effect. For the Preachers, he intreated them that the Popes decree might be obſerued, that thence forward none might preach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his doctrine were examined by the Biſhop. For the Printers and diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Books, he replied that the anſwer no way pleaſed him; that they ought to execute the ſentence of the Pope and Emperour, to burne the bookes, and puniſh the diuulgers, earneſtly aduertiſing them that all conſiſted in this. And concerning bookes to be printed hereafter, that the late <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell ought to be obſerued. But, for the married Prieſts, the anſwere would not haue diſpleaſed him, had it not had a ſting in the taile, while it was ſayd, that if they ſhall doe any wicked thing, they ſhall be puniſhed by the Princes or Magiſtrates. For this would be againſt the liberty of the Church and the ſickle would be put into another mans field, and thoſe men would be cenſured by the world, who are reſerued vnto CHRIST. For Princes ſhould not preſume to beleeue that they were deuolued to their iuriſdiction by their apoſtaſie, nor that they could be puniſhed by them for their other offences, in regard, the character remaining in them, and the order, they are euer vnder the power of the Church; neither can Princes doe more then delate them to their Biſhops and ſuperiours, that may chaſtize them. In the end he deſired them to conſider more maturely vpon the foreſaid things, and to giue a better anſwer, more plaine, more ſound, and better conſulted of.</p>

            <p n="65">65 It would be long to expreſſe the whole contents.

And becauſe the Pope ſayd, that in giuing the remedy, it was neceſſary not to ſtriue to prouide againſt all at once, for feare of cauſing great miſchiefe, but to doe things ſtep by ſtep, they laughed at it; adding that it was well ſayd, ſtep by ſtep, but ſo that there were a whole age betweene one and another. But, in regard of <hi>Adrians</hi> good life before his aſſumption to the Papacie, as well after hee was Biſhop and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, as before, and the good intention which was ſhewed in all his actions, holy men expounded all in good ſenſe, thinking verily that hee confeſſed the errours with ingenuity, and that he would redreſſe them ſooner then hee promiſed; neither did the euent make them iudge the contrary. For the Court being not worthy of ſuch a Pope, it pleaſed God to call him, almoſt as ſoone as he had receiued the relation of his Nuncio from <hi>Noremberg.</hi> For the 13. of September he ended the courſe of his yeeres.</p>
            <p n="68">68 But when the decree of the <hi>Receſſe</hi> of <hi>Noremberg</hi> was publiſhed in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>

For it being ſayd that the things which might ſtirre vp popular tumults, ſhould not be ſpoken of, the Catholiques vnderſtood it, that the things brought in by <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine, and the reproofe of the abuſes of the Eccleſiaſticall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould not be ſpoken of; and the <hi>Lutherans</hi> ſayd, that the meaning of the Diet was, that the abuſes, which ſtirred vp the people againſt the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, when they heard as well bad things as good repreſented vnto them, ſhould not be defended. And that part of the Decree, which commanded to preach the Goſpell according to the doctrine of writers approoued by the Church, the Catholiques vnderſtood, according to the doctrine of the Schoole-men, and the laſt poſtillers of the Scriptures. But the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> ſayd, it was to be vnderſtood of the holy Fathers, <hi>Hilary, Ambroſe, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, Ierom,</hi> and the like; expounding alſo, that by vertue of the Edict of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,</hi> it was lawfull for them to continue in teaching their doctrine vntill the Councell: and the Catholiques vnderſtood that the meaning of the Diet was, that they ſhould continue in the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whereby it appeared that the Edict, in ſtead of quenching the fire of Controuerſies, enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it the more; and in the mindes of godly men there remained a deſire of a free Councell, vnto which it ſeemed, that both the parties would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues; hoping that by this they ſhould bee deliuered from ſo great miſchiefe.</p>

He conſidered that howſoeuer ſome of the 100 greiuances concerned the Court, yet the greater part touched the Biſhops, Officials, Curates, and other Prieſts of <hi>Germanie.</hi> Therefore he hoped if that the foreſaid perſons were reformed, the Germans would eaſily be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to be ſilent for the preſent, in that which concerned <hi>Rome,</hi> and that with that reformation he ſhould haue diuerted the treaty of the Councell. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee thought it conuenient ſuddenly to diſpatch a Legate, a man of wiſedome and authoritie, tothe Diet, which was to be celebrated theree moneths after in <hi>Noremberg,</hi> with inſtruction, to walke in the ſame way and aboue all, to diſſemble the knowledge of <hi>Adrians</hi> propoſitions, and of the anſwers giuen vnto him, that hee might not receiue any preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice in his Tretaie, and might proceede, as if the matter were to begin.</p>
            <p n="70">70 The Legat was <hi>Lorenzo Campeggio,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>S. Anaſtafia,</hi> who being <note place="margin">Card. <hi>Campeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi> is Legat to the Diet of <hi>Noremberg.</hi>
               </note> come to the Diet, after he had treated of diuers things, with diuers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, to ſet his negotiation in order, he ſpake alſo in publique, where hee ſaid, that he wondered that ſo many Princes, and ſo wiſe, could endure that religion, rites, and ceremonies, in which, they, their fathers and anceſtors de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, were borne and bred, ſhould be extinguiſhed and aboliſhed, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that ſuch innouation tended to the rebellion of the people againſt the Magiſtrates. That the Pope not aiming at any intereſt of his owne, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a fatherly compaſſion of <hi>Germanie,</hi> fallen into ſpirituall and temporall infirmities, and ſubiect to very great imminent dangers, had ſent him to find a meanes to cure the diſeaſe. That it was not the intention of his Holineſſe to preſcribe any thing vnto them, much leſſe that any thing ſhould be preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vnto himſelfe, but onely to conſult of the fit remedies, concluding that if the diligence of his Holineſſe were refuſed, it would not afterwards bee reaſonable to lay any fault vpon him.</p>
            <p n="71">71 Hee was anſwered by the Princes (for the Emperour was in <hi>Spaine,</hi> as <note place="margin">The anſwere of the Diet.</note> was ſayd before) after they had thanked the Pope for his good will, that they knew well the danger which hanged ouer their heads, by reaſon of the change of the doctrine of Religion; that therefore, in the Diet the yeere before, they had ſhewed vnto the Nuncio of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> a meanes and way to compoſe the differences, and had giuen him alſo in writing whatſoeuer they deſired or ſought from <hi>Rome;</hi> which writing they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that <hi>Adrian</hi> had receiued, becauſe the Nuncio promiſed to deliuer it, as alſo they thought that the grieuances, which <hi>Germany</hi> receiued from the Clergy, were knowne vnto all, being publiſhed in Print, and that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, euen vntill that inſtant, that their iuſt deſires ſhould be heard, and continued expecting ſtill. Wherefore, if he had any order or inſtruction from
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17208:25"/>
the Pope, they prayed him to declare it, that they might conſult of the whole together with him.</p>
            <p n="72">72 To this the Legat replyed, according to his commiſſion, that he knew not that any inſtruction had bin brought to the Pope or Cardinals, concerning the meanes &amp; way of compoſing the differences in religion. But he well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them of the Popes very good meaning, from whom he had moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power, to doe whatſoeuer might ſerue for that end but that it concerned <note place="margin">The Legeats reply.</note> them to ſhew the way, who knew the condition of the perſons, and the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the country. That it was very well knowne that <hi>Ceſar</hi> in the Diet of <hi>Wormes,</hi> had publiſhed, by their conſent, an Edict againſt the Lutherans, whereunto ſome had giuen obedience, and ſome not; of which diuerſity and variety he knew not the reaſon: but it ſeemed good vnto him, that firſt of all they ought to deliberate of the meanes, how to put it in execution. That although he had not as yet vnderſtood that the 100. grieuances had beene publiſhed to bee preſented to the Pope, notwithſtanding hee knew that three copies had beene brought to ſome priuate men in <hi>Rome,</hi> that himſelfe had ſeene one of them, and that they were ſeene by the Pope and Cardinals, who could not perſwade themſelues that they were collected by any of the Princes, but thought they were ſet out by ſome malignant perſon in ſpite to the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> that although hee had neither order nor inſtruction from the Pope in that matter, yet they ought not to thinke that he had not authority to treat thereof, as occaſion ſerued. Hee ſayd, that in thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds, there were many that derogated from the power of the Pope, and ſauoured of hereſie, that of thoſe he could not treate, but offered to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and to ſpeake of thoſe which were not againſt the Pope, and had ground of equity, that if any thing remained, to be treated of with his Holynes, they might propoſe it, but in more moderate tearmes. That he could not chooſe but finde fault that they were printed and publiſhed, becauſe it ſeemed too much, yet that he was certaine, that the Pope, being Vniuerſall Paſtour, would doe any thing for the loue of <hi>Germany:</hi> but if the voyce of the Paſtour were not heard, the Pope and himſelfe muſt take it patiently, and referre euery thing to God.</p>
            <p n="73">73 The Diet, though they did not thinke it probable, that the Cardinall and <note place="margin">Is ſuspected by the Diet.</note> Pope knew not the treaties with <hi>Adrian,</hi> and iudged, that in the Legates an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres there might be cunning, yet deſiring that good deliberation might be taken for the quiet of their Country, they deputed ſome Princes to negotiate with the Cardinall, who could get nothing from him, but that he would haue a good reformation made of the Clergy of <hi>Germany;</hi> but for the abuſe of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was not poſſible to make him yeeld to anything. For when they began to diſcourſe of them, either he ſayd that it was hereſic to reprehend them, or that hee referred it to the Pope, and that it was neceſſary to treat with him thereof.</p>
            <p n="74">74 The Cardinall made a reformation of <hi>Germanie,</hi> the which (touching <note place="margin">And his refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was not accepted.</note> only the inferiour Clergie, and being iudged that it would not onely cheriſh the euill, as light remedies alwaies doe, but that it would ſerue to inlarge the dominion of the Court, and greater Prelates to the preiudice of temporall authoritie, and would make an entrance to greater extorſions of money) was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17208:25"/>
not receiued, it being eſteemed but a maske to delude <hi>Germany,</hi> and to reduce it vnder greater tyranny, though the Legate vſed all effectuall diligence that it might be accepted. Wherefore he would not conſent to any of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, made by the deputies of the Diet. By this it being plaine, that it was impoſſible to conclude any thing with him, they publiſhed the receſſe the eighteenth of Aprill, with a Decree, that by the Pope, with conſent of the Emperour, a free Councell, in ſome conuenient place in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſhould be <note place="margin">The Decree of the Diet.</note> intimated, ſo ſoone as was poſſible; and that the States of the Empire ſhould aſſemble themſelues at <hi>Spira</hi> the eighteenth of Nouember, to determine what courſe ſhould be taken vntill the Councell were begun. That euery Prince ſhould call together, in his owne State, men, godly and learned, to collect the things that ought to be diſputed on in the Councell. That the Magiſtrates ſhould haue care that the Goſpel ſhould be preached according to the doctrine of the approoued writers of the Church, and all pictures and contumelious bookes againſt the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be prohibited.</p>
            <p n="75">75 The Legat hauing anſwered to euery point of the Decree, and ſhewed <note place="margin">With which the Legat was not pleaſep.</note> that it was not the office of Seculars, to deliberate of any thing concerning faith and doctrine, or preaching thereof, he promiſed that he would giue the Pope an account concerning the Councell onely.</p>
            <p n="76">76 The Princes being gone from the Diet, the Legat endeauoured to bring <note place="margin">He laboureth to cauſe his reformation to be receiued.</note> together thoſe that moſt fauoured the affaires of <hi>Rome,</hi> to cauſe the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which the Diet would not receiue) to be publiſhed; and there did meete him in <hi>Ratisbon, Ferdinand</hi> the Emperours brother, the Cardinall Archbiſhop of <hi>Salzburg,</hi> two Dukes of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> two Biſhops, of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> and the Agents of nine Biſhops. Where firſt they made a Decree vnder the date of the ſixt of Iuly; That it hauing beene ordered in the aſſembly at <hi>Noremberg,</hi> that the Edict of <hi>Wormes</hi> againſt <hi>Luther</hi> ſhould be put in execution, as farre as was poſſible, therefore they, at the inſtance of the Legat, Cardinall <hi>Campeggio,</hi> did command that it ſhould be obſerued in all their Dominions and States. That the innouators ſhould be puniſhed, according to the forme of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. That nothing ſhould be changed in the Celebration of the Maſſe and Sacraments. That the Apoſtates, Monkes and Nunnes, and married Prieſts, and thoſe that receiued the Euchariſt without confeſſion, or did eate forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den meates, ſhould be puniſhed. And that all their ſubiects that were in the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> ſhould depart from thence, within three moneths, and returne home, or goe to ſome other place. The day following, beeing the ſeauenth, the Cardinall publiſhed his Conſtitutions of the reformation, <note place="margin">And effecteth it.</note> which were approoued by all the forenamed Princes, and it was commanded that they ſhould bee publiſhed, receiued, and obſerued, throughout all their States and Dominions.</p>
            <p n="77">77 In the proheme of the Conſtitutions the Cardinall ſaid, that to reforme the life &amp; manners of the Clergie being a thing of great moment for the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of the Lutheran hereſie, he had ordained theſe decrees by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Princes, and Prelats aſſembled with him, which he commanded to be obſerued throughout all <hi>Germany,</hi> by the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other <note place="margin">The reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contained 37. heads</note> Prelates, Prieſts, and Regulars, and publiſhed in all the Cities and Churches. They contained ſeauen and thirty heads, concerning the apparell and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17208:26"/>
of the Cleargie, adminiſtring <hi>gratis</hi> the Sacraments, and other Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall functions, Banquets, Fabriques of the Churches; thoſe that were to take orders, celebration of holy-dayes, faſtings: againſt Prieſts that were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, againſt thoſe that confeſſed not, nor communicated, againſt blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, ſorcerers, ſoothſayers, and other things like theſe. In concluſion, the celebration of Dioceſan Councels euery yeare was commanded for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of theſe Statutes, giuing the Biſhops power to inuocate the ſecular arme againſt the tranſgreſſors.</p>
            <p n="78">78 The Edict of the reformation being diuulged, the Princes and Biſhops, who in the Diet had not conſented to the Cardinals demand, were offended, as well with him, as with all thoſe that aſſembled in <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> it ſeeming vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Diuers Princes and Biſhops were offended with the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this reformation.</note> them, that they were wronged by the Legat, for making a generall order for all <hi>Germany,</hi> in a meeting of ſome fewe onely; and ſo much the rather, becauſe it was done after it was demonſtrated vnto him, that no good could come thereby. They thought themſelues iniured alſo by thoſe fewe Princes and Biſhops, who alone had taken vpon them to oblige all <hi>Germany,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the opinion of the reſt. It was oppoſed alſo againſt that reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that, leauing the things of importance, as if there had beene no diſorder in them, they made prouiſion in things of the ſmalleſt weight. For <hi>Germany</hi> ſuffered but little inconuenience by the abuſes of the inferiour Cleargy, but great by the vſurpation of the Biſhops and Prelates, and greateſt of all by thoſe of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet there was no mention made of them, as if they were now in better order then in the Primitiue Church. Then concerning the inferiour Clergy, the principall abuſes were not treated of, but thoſe that were of leaſt conſequence, which was, as it were to approoue them; and thoſe alſo that were reprehended, were left without their true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, being onely noted without applying the medicine, neceſſary to cure the malady.</p>
            <p n="79">79 But the Legat, and the forenamed Princes that met him, cared but little for what was ſaid in <hi>Germany,</hi> and leſſe for what would follow the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Edict. For their end was onely to ſatisfie the Pope, and the Popes end was onely to ſhew, that he had made prouiſion that there ſhould be no need of a Councell. For <hi>Clement,</hi> a man skilfull in State affaires, euen in <hi>Adrians</hi> time, alwayes maintained that it was pernicious counſell, in the occurrences of thoſe times, to vſe the meanes of Councels; and was wont to ſay, that a <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Clement</hi> did euer thinkes Councell dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous when the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was in queſtion.</note> Councell was alwayes good when any thing elſe was treated of but the Popes authority, but, that being called into queſtion, that nothing was more dangerous. For as in former times, the Popes ſtrength conſiſted in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing recourſe to Councels, ſo now the ſecurity of the Popedome conſiſteth in declining and auoyding them, and the rather, becauſe <hi>Leo</hi> hauing condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> the ſame matter could not bee handled or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in a Councell, without doubting of the authority of the Apoſtolicall Sea.</p>
            <p n="80">80 The Emperour hauing receiued the Decree of <hi>Noremberg,</hi> was much mooued at it; thinking that to treat and giue ſo reſolute an anſwere to a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <note place="margin">The Emperour was diſtaſted with the decree of <hi>Noremberg.</hi>
               </note> Prince, without his knowledge, in ſo important a matter, was but ſmall reputation to his imperiall Maieſty. Neither did the rigour of the Decree
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17208:26"/>
pleaſe him, foreſeeing the Popes diſpleaſure, whom he deſired to keepe louing <note place="margin">1525 CLEMENT 7. CHARLES 5.—HENRY 8.

            <p n="83">83 The Cities, for the moſt part, anſwered, that their deſire was to gratifie and obey the Emperour, but that they ſaw not the meanes how to doe that which he commanded in his letters, becauſe the controuerſies were increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and did increaſe ſtill, particularly concerning the ceremonies, and rites: and if for the time paſt the Edict of <hi>Wormes</hi> could not bee obſerued, for feare of Sedition, the difficulty was then greater, as was declared to the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. And if the Emperour were preſent, and informed of the ſtate of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, hee would bee of the ſame opinion. Concerning the promiſe of his Maieſty, for the celebration of a Councell; euery one ſaid, hee might haue effected it when he wrot the letters, becauſe he was then in amity with the Pope; but afterwards there being diſtaſtes betweene them, and the Pope ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken armes againſt him, it appeared not how, things ſtanding thus, a Councell could be called.

            <p n="86">86 This diſpatch being ſent into <hi>Spaine,</hi> the next day he wrot and diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another Briefe to the Emperour, without making mention of the firſt. <note place="margin">And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate then the former.</note> Where he ſaid in ſubſtance, that, for the maintaining of the liberty of <hi>Italie,</hi> and the prouiding againſt the dangers of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> he had beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to come to theſe deliberations, which could not be omitted with out failing to performe the duty of a good Pope, and a iuſt Prince. Wherein if his Maieſty will afford the remedy, which is eaſie, profitable, and glorious
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17208:28"/>
for him to doe, hee ſhall thereby deliuer Chriſtendome from a great feare; whereof his Nuncio reſiding with him, ſhall giue him an account more at large. He prayed him, for Gods ſake, to heare him, and to prouide for the publike wel-fare, and to containe within the termes of iuſtice, the vnbridled, and iniurious deſires of his miniſters, that others may reſt ſecure of their goods and liues. Vnder theſe laſt words the Pope comprehended principally <hi>Pompeius,</hi> Cardinall <hi>Colonna, Veſpaſianus,</hi> and <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> with others of that family, who followed the Imperiall part, and were aſſiſted by the Vice-roy of <hi>Naples:</hi> from whom hee daily receiued diuers oppoſitions to his ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours. And, which made greater impreſſion in his mind, he feared alſo that they might bring the Papacie into ſtraights. For the forenamed Cardinall, a man bould and proud, contented not himſelfe to ſpeake of him publikely, as of one aſſumed to the Papacie by vnlawfull meanes, magnifying what the houſe of <hi>Colonna</hi> had done againſt other Popes, intruders (as hee named them) and vnlawfully choſen, but he added that it was fatall to that family to hate the tyrannicall Popes, and to them to bee reprehended by the vertue of it: and threatned him with a Councell, and treated with all the Emperors miniſters, to perſwade the Emperour to call it. Whereby the Pope being prouoked to anger, the better to preuent him, publiſhed a ſeuere Monitory againſt that Cardinall, citing him to <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder the greateſt penalties and <note place="margin">The Popeſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie againſt Card. <hi>Colonna.</hi>
               </note> cenſures; in which alſo hee touched manifeſtly the Vice-roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> and obliquely the Emperour. But the warre was not proſperouſly begunne in <hi>Lombardie,</hi> the army of the French King, not appearing as yet; and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian army was diſcomfited at the ſame time in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> dead, the number of thoſe who followed <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine did ſtill increaſe, and all men required a Councell, which might make an vniuerſall peace amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and giue an end to ſo great diſorders.</p>
            <p n="87">87 The Pope for theſe cauſes, hauing firſt compoſed the differences with <note place="margin">And hauing changed his mind, maketh a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in Conſiſtorie.</note> thoſe of the houſe of <hi>Colonna,</hi> and aboliſhed the Monitory ſent out againſt the Cardinall, called a Conſiſtory the thirteenth of September; in which hee comiſerated, in a long diſcourſe, the calamities of Chriſtendome, bewayled the death of the King of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and attributed all misfortune to the anger of God, ſtirred vp by ſinne, confeſſing that all began from the deformation of the Clergy. Hee ſhewed how it was neceſſary, for the appeaſing of it, to begin (for ſo hee ſaid) from the houſe of God, wherein hee would giue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in his owne perſon. He excuſed the rayſing of armes, and the Proceſſe againſt thoſe of the houſe of <hi>Colonna,</hi> exhorted the Cardinalls to amend their manners, ſaid hee would goe in perſon to all the Princes, to negotiate an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall Peace, reſolute rather to die, then to leaue this enterpriſe, vntill he had brought it to effect, yet aſſuredly truſting in God to ſee the concluſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The which being obtained, hee reſolued to call a generall Councell, to extinguiſh the diuiſion in the Church, and to take away the hereſies. Hee exhorted the Cardinalls, euery one to thinke of, and propoſe vnto him all thoſe meanes, which they thought might ſerue for theſe two endes, that is, to plant peace, and roote out hereſie. The Popes diſcourſe was publiſhed throughout <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> and Copies thereof were <note place="margin">The Popes diſcourſe was thought not to be ſincere.</note> ſent abroad by many; and though it was much helped by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17208:28"/>
of his followers, yet few beleeued it to bee ſincere.</p>
            <p n="88">88 But in <hi>Spaine</hi> the two letters being preſented by the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> to the Emperour, the one a day after the other, there was much ſurmiſing rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Counſell of that Prince. Some of them beleeued that <hi>Clement,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting himſelfe of the bitterneſſe of the firſt, had wrot the ſecond for a medicine: wherefore they aduiſed that no notice ſhould bee taken thereof. And this opinion was increaſed by a report giuen out by the Nuncio, that <note place="margin">Surmiſes in <hi>Spaine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the two Briefes of the Pope.</note> by the ſecond hee had receiued order, that if the firſt were not deliuered, it ſhould not bee deliuered at all, but ſent backe againe, and the ſecond onely conſigned. The wiſer ſort ſaw well enough, that if the Pope had repented, hee might haue preuented the firſt Corrier, by cauſing the ſecond to make more haſt: moreouer, that it was not likely that ſo wiſe a Prince as hee, would reſolue to write ſo bitterly without great conſultation. Therefore they thought it was a kind of cunning to make a proteſtation, and not to haue an anſwer. And it was reſolued that the Emperour ſhould imitate him, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour maketh two anſweres.</note> to the firſt with termes fitting ſeuerity, and a day after to the ſecond, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the forme thereof.</p>
            <p n="89">89 And ſo it was done, and an apologeticall letter was written by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour the ſeuenteenth of September, which in the originall conteined 22. <note place="margin">The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined 22 ſheets of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> all paper.</note> ſheetes of royall paper, which <hi>Mercurius Gattinara</hi> preſented open to the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and read it to him, and ſealed it in his preſence, and conſigned it, that hee might cauſe it to be deliuered to the Pope. In the beginning of the letter the Emperour ſhewed that the forme which the Pope held was diſproportionable to the duty of a true Paſtor, and not correſpondent to the filiall obedience which hee had performed towards the Apoſtolicall Sea, and his Holineſſe, who ſo prayſed his owne actions, and ſo condemned his, with titles of ambition and auarice, that he was conſtrained to declare his innocency. And beginning the narration from what happened in the time of <hi>Leo,</hi> afterwards in the time of <hi>Adrian,</hi> and finally in his Papacie, he ſhewed that he had a good intention in all his actions, and was inforced to doe as hee had done, laying the fault vpon the Pope. Hee repeated many benefits which hee had done him, and on the contrary ſide many treaties which the Pope had made againſt him in diuers occaſions: and in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he ſaid, that he deſired nothing more then the publique quiet, an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall peace, and the iuſt liberty of <hi>Italie.</hi> Which things if they were deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his Holineſſe, hee ought to lay downe his weapons, putting <hi>Peters</hi> ſword into the ſheath. For this foundation being laid, it was eaſie to build peace thereupon, and to apply themſelues to correct the errours of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, and other heretiques; wherein hee ſhould haue found him an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſonne. But if his Holineſſe did otherwiſe, hee proteſted before God and men, that hee could not bee blamed for none of theſe ſiniſter chances which ſhould happen to Chriſtian Religion; promiſing that if hee will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his iuſtifications as true and lawfull, hee will not remember any iniuries receiued. But if hee ſhall continue to beare armes againſt him, becauſe this will not bee the office of a father, but of a party, nor of a Paſtor, but of an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayler, it will not be conuenient that hee bee iudge in thoſe cauſes, and there being none other vnto whom recourſe may he had againſt him, for his own
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17208:29"/>
iuſtification, hee will referre all to the knowledge and iudgement of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell of all Chriſtendome; exhorting his Holineſſe in the Lord to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate it in a ſecure and fit place, limiting vnto it a conuenient terme. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of the Church and of Religion to be altogether troubled, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for his owne and the Common-wealths ſafety, hee flieth to that ſacred and vniuerſall Councell, and appealeth vnto it againſt all the threats paſt, and grieuances to come.</p>
            <p n="90">90 The anſwer to the ſecond was made the eighteenth; and in that he ſaid, that hee was glad to ſee his Holineſſe treat more louingly, and to deſire peace <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours anſwer to the ſecond Briefe.</note> more earneſtly in his ſecond letters; which if it were as much in his power to eſtabliſh, as it is in the power of others to make warre, he ſhould ſee what his mind was. Although he thinketh that his Holines ſpeaketh as thruſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by others, not of his voluntary mind, and hopeth in God that hee will rather procure the publique good, then follow the affections of other men. Wherefore he prayeth him to behold the calamities of Chriſtendome. For he calleth God to witneſſe, that he will be alwaies ready to let euery one know, that he hath none other end then the glory of God, and the ſafety of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; as he hath written more at large in the other letters.</p>
            <p n="91">91 The Emperour, the ſixt of October, wrot alſo to the Colledge of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls; that he was exceedingly grieued, that the Pope forgetting the Papall <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror writeth to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals.</note> dignity, went about to diſturbe the publique quiet, and when he thought hee had giuen peace to the whole world, by making the accord with the French King, that letters came to him from his Holineſſe, ſuch as hee neuer thought would haue come from a common Father, and Vicar of CHRIST: which he beleeued alſo were not reſolued on without their counſell, becauſe he was perſwaded that the Pope treated not of things of ſo great a moment, without communicating all vnto them. Therefore hee was troubled very much, to ſee that from a Pope, and ſo religious fathers, ſhould proceed warres, threats, and pernicious counſells againſt an Emperour, protectour of the Church, and ſo well deſeruing, that to pleaſe them hee ſtopped his eares in <hi>Wormes</hi> againſt the prayers of all <hi>Germanie,</hi> made vnto him againſt the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and grieuanes, which it receiued from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king none account of the honeſt demands that a Councell might bee called, to withſtand the foreſaid oppreſſions, which would be as much as to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Lutheran hereſie. That to ſerue the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> hee had prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited the meeting at <hi>Spira,</hi> which <hi>Germanie</hi> had intimated, foreſeeing that it would haue bin a beginning to ſeparate it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the obedience of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; hath diuerted the thoughts of thoſe Princes by promiſing them a Councel. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hauing written, and giuen an account to the Pope, his Holineſſe thanked him for hauing forbid the aſſembly of <hi>Spira,</hi> but prayed him to deferre to ſpeake of a Councell vntill a more conuenient time. And hee, to pleaſe, made more account to giue him ſatisfaction, then of the prayers of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> which were ſo neceſſarie. And yet for all this the Pope now wrot letters vnto him, full of complaints and imputations, demanding things of him, which hee could neither iuſtly, nor ſecurely grant. Of which letters he ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them a copy, being deſirous to ſignifie the whole vnto them, that they might vphold Chriſtianity, now ready to fall, and imploy themſelues

And further they expected, that for theſe letters the Pope would ſhew ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of reuenge, the Emperour hauing touched two great ſecrets of the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: the one in appealing from the Pope to a future Councell, contrary to the Conſtitutions of <hi>Pius</hi> and <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſeconds, the other, in hauing inuited the Cardinalls to call a Councell, in caſe of a negatiue giuen, or a dilation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed by the Pope.

And the Pope himſelfe, ſurprized vpon the ſudden, and wholly confuſed, knowing not what reſolution to take, called for the ſolemne Pontificall habits, ſaying, that ſo apparelled, to the imitation of <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. ſitting in the Pontificall chaire, hee would expect to ſee if they dared adde to the firſt, a ſecond violation of the Apoſtolicall dignity, in the perſon of the Pope himſelfe.

            <p n="97">97 In the end of Ianuarie, <hi>Borbon</hi> paſſed the <hi>Po</hi> with all his troupes, and directed his iourney towards <hi>Romania:</hi> which march troubled <hi>Clement</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, conſidering the qualitie of the men, and the continuall threats of <hi>Franſperg,</hi> who cauſed a halter to be caried neere his Colours, ſaying, that <note place="margin">He calleth with him an halter to hang the Pope.</note> with that he would hang the Pope, the better to encourage his men to ſtand vnited, and to ſupport the iourney though they were not paid: All which things induced the Pope to giue care to <hi>Ceſar Fieramoſca,</hi> a Neapolitan, who came newly from <hi>Spaine,</hi> and brought a long letter from <hi>Ceſar,</hi> full of offers. And, aſſuring his Holines, that his Maieſty diſliked the inuaſion of <hi>Rome,</hi> made by the <hi>Colonneſi,</hi> and that he was deſirous of peace, he induced him to kearken to the truce, which ſhould be negotiated between him, &amp; the Viceroy of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> And although in March, Captaine <hi>George Franſperg</hi> was taken with a fit of an Apoplexie, which cauſed his death, yet becauſe the army was entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Franſperg <hi>dieth.</hi>

not to tary, but to paſſe immediately into <hi>Rome,</hi> and from thence, to goe to ſome ſecure place, yet, refuſing this good counſell, hee reſolued to remaine there.

But this not beeing done, the Souldiers paſſed into the Citie, ſpoyled not onely the houſes, but the Churches alſo of all their ornaments, caſting on the ground; and treading vnder feet the reliques, and other ſacred things which were not of value, putting the Cardinals and other Prelates in priſon, making a mocke of their perſons, by ſetting them on vilebeaſts in the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall <note place="margin">The Cardinals impriſoned &amp; mocked, and ſome of them beaten.</note> habit. It is certaine, that the Cardinals of <hi>Siena, Minerua,</hi> and <hi>Ponceta</hi> were well beaten, and carried moſt baſely in proceſſion, and that the Spaniſh and German Cardinals, though they were confident, becauſe the armie was compoſed of their nations, were not better vſed then the reſt.

            <p n="100">100 While the Princes were all buſied in war, the affaires of religion alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in diuers places; in ſome, by publike Decree of the Magiſtrates; in others, by popular ſedition.

agreed alſo to receiue one another at the Coronation, with the accuſtomed ceremonies.

            <p n="106">106 In the Diet they firſt treated of Religion: And the Catholiques thought <note place="margin">The Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue of <hi>Haſſia</hi> preuenteth the diuiſion which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, would haue made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Reformatiſts.</note> to put diſſention between their aduerſaries, diuided into two opinions, ſome following the doctrine of <hi>Luther,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> if the Landgraue of <hi>Haſſia,</hi> a man wiſe and prouident, had not withſtood the danger; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the difference was not great, and giuing hope that it might eaſily be accorded, and declaring the dammage that would ariſe by the diuiſion, and the aduantage which their aduerſaries would haue gained. After long diſputation in the Diet, to finde out a forme of compoſition, in the ende a Decree was made, that, the Decree of the former Diet of <hi>Spira,</hi> beeing wreſted by the bad interpretations to defend all abſurditie of opinions, and <note place="margin">The decree of the Diet of <hi>Spira.</hi>
               </note> therefore being now conſtrained to expound it, they ordained, That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer had obſerued the Emperours Edict of <hi>Wormes,</hi> ſhould obſerue it ſtill, compelling alſo the people thereunto vntill the time of the Councel, which the Emperour gaue aſſured hope ſhould be called ſhortly: and hee that had changed doctrine, and could not bee reduced without danger of ſedition, ſhould abide there, and innouate nothing more vntill the Councell began: that the Maſſe ſhould not bee taken away, nor hindred in any place where the new doctrine was receiued; that Anabaptiſme ſhould be puniſhed capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, according to the Edict publiſhed by the Emperour, which they ratified,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17208:33"/>
and that concerning the Sermons and Prints, the Decrees made in the two laſt Diets of <hi>Noremberg</hi> ſhould be obſerued; that is, that the Preachers bee circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, take heede of giuing offenſiue words, and giue not occaſion to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to riſe againſt the Magiſtrate, that they propoſe no new opinions which haue no foundation in the holy Scripture, but preach the Goſpell according to the interpretation approoued by the Church, without touching other things that be diſputable, expecting the determination of the Councel, where all ſhall be lawfully decided.</p>
            <p n="107">107 The Elector of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> and fiue Princes more, oppoſed themſelues to this Decree, ſaying, that they ought not to forſake the Decree made in the <note place="margin">Is oppoſed.</note> former Diet, by which euery one might exerciſe his owne religion vntill the Councell; which Decree being made by the common conſent of all, could not without the ſame conſent, bee changed. That the originall cauſe of the diſſentions was very clearely perceiued in the Diet of <hi>Noremberg,</hi> and the ſame Pope, vnto whom the demands were ſent, and the hundred grieuances ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, confeſſed it; yet for all this, no amendment was ſeene. That, in all the conſultations it was euer concluded, that there was no way more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to remooue the controuerſies then by a Councell. In the meane ſpace, while this is expected, to receiue their Decree, were to denie the pure and vndefiled word of God; and to allow the Maſſe, were to renew the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. They ſaid they commended that part, that is, to preach the Goſpell according to the interpretations approoued by the Church, but that there remained a doubt which was the true Church. That to eſtabliſh a Decree ſo obſcure, was to lay open a way to many tumults and controuerſies, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would not by any meanes giue conſent vnto it. That they would giue account to all men, and euen vnto <hi>Ceſar</hi> himſelfe, of this their opinion. And that vntill the beginning of the Councell, either generall of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or nationall of <hi>Germanie,</hi> they will doe nothing that may iuſtly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued.</p>

And the contention alwayes increaſed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17208:34"/>
euery day more bitter, eſpecially on <hi>Martins</hi> ſide, who treated after a ſharpe manner againſt the aduerſe partie. And this gaue matter to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes in this yeeres Diet of <hi>Spira,</hi> to be able (as hath beene ſaid) to put diſtruſt and diſtaſt betweene the parties. But the <hi>Landgraue</hi> of <hi>Haſsia,</hi> who, hauing diſcouered the cunning of the aduerſaries, kept his ſide in peace, with hope to reconcile the contrary opinions, as Well to maintaine his promiſe, as to withſtand future dangers, procured a conference, ſollicited the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> to ſend <note place="margin">The confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Marpurg.</hi> 1529</note> their men, and aſſigned <hi>Marpurg</hi> for the place of the diſputation, and all the moneth of October of the ſame yeere 1529. There came out of <hi>Saxonie, Luther</hi> and his two ſchollers, and out of <hi>Suiſſerland, Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Ecolampadius.</hi> Only <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> diſputed, and the diſputation continued many dayes; yet <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> could not agree.</note> for all this it was impoſſible for them to agree; whether it were, becauſe the controuerſie being paſſed on ſo farre, it ſeemed that the honour of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors was in queſtion, or becauſe, as it happeneth in verball contentions, the ſmalneſſe of the difference, nouriſheth the obſtinacie of the parties: or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as a little after <hi>Martin</hi> wrote to a friend, ſeeing much tumult rayſed, he would not by <hi>Zuinglius</hi> his forme of words, which the Romaniſts ſo much abhorred, make his Princes more odious, and expoſe them to greater danger. But bee the cauſe what it will, one more vniuerſall is very true, that it pleaſed the Maieſty of God to vſe this difference of opinions, for diuers effects, which followed after. It was neceſſarie to end the colloquie without concluſion, but that, by the meanes of the <hi>Landgraue</hi> they agreed in this, that being of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in all other points, they ought heereafter to abſtaine from bitterneſſe in this particular, praying God to ſhew ſome light of agreement. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, though reſolued on with wiſedome, and, as they ſaid, with charitie, being not followed by their ſucceſſours, hindered very much the progreſſe of the reformed Doctrine. For in cauſe of religion, euery ſub-diuiſion is a ſtrong weapon in the hand of the contrary part.</p>
            <p>But the league betweene the Pope and Emperour being concluded, as hath beene ſaid, and the order ſet downe for the Coronation, the Citie of <note place="margin">The Pope and Emperour met at <hi>Bologna</hi> about the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation, but treated of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other matters.</note> 
               <hi>Bolonia</hi> was appointed for the place. For it ſeemed not conuenient to the Pope that this ſolemnitie ſhould bee performed in <hi>Rome,</hi> in the preſence of thoſe who had ſacked it but two yeeres before. This was acceptable alſo to <hi>Charles,</hi> becauſe it made the ceremonies more ſhort: which he deſired, that he might paſſe into <hi>Germanie</hi> ſo ſoone as might bee. Therefore the Pope, as the greater perſon, arriued firſt in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and afterwards the Emperour the fifth of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember, where hee taried foure moneths, and remained in the ſame pallace with the Pope. Many things were treated of by theſe two Princes, partly for the vniuerſall quiet of Chriſtendome, and partly for the priuate intereſt of the one and the other. The principall were, the generall peace of <hi>Italie,</hi> and the extirpation of the Proteſtants in <hi>Germanie.</hi> To ſpeake of the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to the ſubiect that is handled, but concerning the Proteſtants, it was propoſed by one of the Emperours Counſellors, that, conſidering the nature of Germans, who are tenacious of libertie, it were better by faire meanes and ſweet repreſentations, &amp; by diſſembling the knowledge of many things, to cauſe the Princes to returne to the obedience of the Pope. For this protection being taken from the new Doctors, the reſidue would eaſily bee
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17208:35"/>
remedied. And to doe this, a Councell was the true and proper remedie: as well becauſe it was deſired by them, as becauſe euery one would bow at that maieſticall and venerable name.</p>
            <p>But the Pope, who feared nothing more then a Councell, eſpecially if it were to bee celebrated beyond the mountaines, free, and in the preſence of thoſe, who alreadie had openly ſhaken off the yoke of obedience, ſaw very well what an eaſie thing it was for theſe to perſwade the others alſo. Hee conſidered further, that although the cauſe was common to him with all other Biſhops, whom the new opinions ſought to depriue of the wealth they poſſeſſed, yet there remained ſome matter of diſtaſt, betweene them and the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> For they pretended that collation of Benefices, with the reſeruations and preuentions, was vſurped from them, and a great part of their authoritie taken away, and drawen to <hi>Rome,</hi> by calling of cauſes thither, by reſeruations of diſpenſations, &amp; abſolutions, and ſuch like faculties, which formerly being common to all Biſhops, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> had appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to themſelues. Whereupon it was repreſented vnto him, that the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of a Councell would be a totall diminution of the Popes authoritie. Therefore he turned all his thoughts to perſwade the Emperor, that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell <note place="margin">And the Pope did infinitely diſſwade the Emperour from deſiring a Councell.</note> vvas not good, to pacifie the ſtirres of <hi>Germanie,</hi> but pernicious for the Imperiall authoritie in thoſe Prouinces. He put him in mind of two ſorts of perſons, the multitude, and the Princes and Grandies: that it vvas probable that the multitude vvas deceiued, but to giue it ſatisfaction in the demand of a Councell, vvas not to giue it more light, but to bring in popular licence. If it vvere granted vnto them to make queſtion, or ſeeke greater perſpicuitie in religion, they vvould immediately pretend alſo to giue lavves for gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to reſtraine the authoritie of Princes by Decrees: and vvhen they haue obtained to examine and diſcuſſe the Eccleſiaſticall authority, they vvill learne alſo to trouble the temporall. He ſhevved him that it vvas more eaſie to oppoſe the firſt demaunds of a multitude, then after they had beene grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in part, to preſcribe them a meaſure. For the Princes and Grandies, hee might aſſure himſelfe, that their end was not pietie, but the making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues Lords of the Eccleſiaſticall goods, and being become abſolute, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Emperour nothing at all, or very little; and that many of them kept themſelues vnſpotted with that contagion, becauſe they haue not, as yet, diſcouered the ſecret, which being made manifeſt, they will all addreſſe themſelues to the ſame ſcope. That there was no doubt but that the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio would loſe much in the loſſe of <hi>Germanie:</hi> but the loſſe of the Emperour, and of the houſe of Auſtria would bee farre greater. Againſt which, if hee would make prouiſion, he had no other meanes, then ſeuerely to imploy his authoritie and power, while the greater part obeyed him: wherein expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was neceſſarie, before the number increaſed, and the profit were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by all, which is reaped by following thoſe opinions. That vnto expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo neceſſarie, nothing is more contrarie, then to treate of a Councell. For though euery one incline himſelfe to it, and no impediment bee inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, yet it cannot bee aſſembled but in length of yeeres, nor the cauſes han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled without prolixitie: which thing onely he would conſider. For it were infinite to ſpeake of impediments which would bee rayſed for diuers inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17208:35"/>
reſts of perſons, who would oppoſe themſelues with diuers pretences, at the leaſt putting in delayes, that it may come to nothing. That there was a ſame ſpread, that the Popes will haue no Councell, for feare their authoritie ſhould be reſtrained, a reaſon, which maketh no impreſſion at all in him, hauing his authoritie immediately from Chriſt, with promiſe, that the gates of hell ſhall not preuaile againſt it. And the experience of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times hath ſhewed; that the Papall authoritie hath neuer beene dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in any Councell, but according to the words of our Lord, the Fathers haue euer confeſſed it to bee abſolute and vnlimited, as it is in deede. And when the Popes in humilitie, or for ſome other reſpect, haue forborne to vſe it intirely, the Fathers haue made him to put it wholly in execution. And this is cleerely to be ſeene by him that ſhall reade the things that are paſt. For the Popes haue alwayes imployed this meanes againſt the new opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of heretiques, and in euery other neceſſitie, with increaſe of their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. And ſetting aſide the promiſe of CHRIST, which is the true and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foundation, and conſidering the things but temporally the Councel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of Biſhops; vnto Biſhops the Papall greatneſſe is profitable, becauſe they are by that protected againſt Prince and people. Kings and other So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereignes alſo who haue vnderſtood, and will vnderſtand well the rules of gouerning, will alwayes fauour the Apoſtolicall authoritie, hauing no other meanes to repreſſe and keepe in order their Prelates, when they haue the ſpirit to goe beyond their degree. The Pope concluded, that in his minde hee was ſo aſſured of the iſſue, that hee could ſpeake thereof as a Prophet; and affirme, that, by calling a Councel, greater diſorders would enſue in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> For thoſe that deſire it, pretend to continue vntill then in what they haue begun, when their opinions ſhall bee condemned, and nothing elſe can ſucceede, they will take another cloake to detract from the Councell: and in concluſion the Emperours authoritie in <hi>Germany</hi> will come to nothing, and in other places will be ſhaken; the Popes power will bee diminiſhed in that Countrey, and in all the reſidue of the world, will bee increaſed the more. And therefore the Emperour ſhould beleeue his opinion, the rather becauſe hee was not mooued by his proper intereſt, but with a deſire to ſee <hi>Germany</hi> reunited to the Church, and himſelfe obeyed. That nothing <note place="margin">The Pope perſwadeth the Emperor to execute the ſentence of <hi>Leo,</hi> and the Edict of <hi>Wormes.</hi>
               </note> would take good effect, if hee went not preſently into <hi>Germany,</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately vſed his authoritie, intimating that the ſentence of <hi>Leo,</hi> and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of <hi>Wormes</hi> ſhould bee executed without any replie, not giuing eare to any thing the Proteſtants could ſay, either demanding a Councell, or more inſtruction, or alleaging their appeale or proteſtation, or any other excuſe, becauſe they are all but pretences of impietie. That hee ſhould vſe force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt incounter of diſobedience, which would bee eaſie for him to doe againſt a few, hauing all the Eccleſiaſticall Princes, and the greater part of the Seculars, who, to this end, would take armes with him. That this and no other thing is congruous to the office of the Emperour, Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the oath taken in <hi>Aquiſgran,</hi> and which hee ought to take in receiuing the Crowne from his hand. Laſtly, that it was a cleere caſe, that the holding of a Councell, or any other treatie or nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation in this occaſion, would neceſſarily end with warre. Therefore it was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17208:36"/>

In concluſion they offered, in caſe it were needfull, a more full information.

            <p>This was the onely Act of the firſt day. But the Emperour, before he made any reſolution, would haue the Legates aduice. Who, hauing read <note place="margin">The Legate would not cenſure the Confeſſion.</note> and conſidered the confeſſion, together with the Diuines which he brought

               </gap> it wrought diuers effects in the mindes of the Catholiques who heard it. Some thought the Proteſtants more wicked, then they were perſwaded, before they were informed of their particular opinions others on the contrary, remitted much of the bad conceit they had againſt them, eſteeming their opinions not to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as before they did, yea, for a great part of the abuſes, they confeſſed they were iuſtly reprehended. It is not to be omitted that Cardinal <hi>Mattheo Langi,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Salzburg,</hi> told euery one, that the reformation of the Maſſe <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Salz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> would not haue the world refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a Monke.</note> was honeſt, the libertie of meates conuenient, and the demand iust, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened of ſo many commandements of men, but that a poore Monke ſhould reforme all, was not to bee endured. And <hi>Cornelius Scoperus,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Secretarie, ſaide, that if the Proteſtant Preachers had money, they would eaſily buy of the Italians what Religion pleaſed them beſt, but without golde, it was impoſſible to make theirs ſhine in the world.</p>
            <p>The Emperour, according to the Legates aduice, approued alſo by his owne Counſellers, deſirous to compoſe all by a negatiue, went firſt about to ſeparate the Ambaſſadors of the cities from ioyning with the Princes: which proiect not ſucceeding, he cauſed a confutation to be made of what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants put vp in writing, and another of that which was produced by the Cities. And hauing called the whole Diet together, hee told the Proteſtants that he had conſidered of the confeſſion preſented vnto him, and giuen or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſome pious and learned men, to deliuer their opinion thereof. And heere he made the confutation of it to be read, in which, many of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions being taxed, it was confeſſed in the end, that in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there were ſome things fit to bee amended, againſt which hee promiſed that prouiſion ſhould be made, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> therefore that the Proteſtants ought to referre themſelues vnto him, and returne to the Church, aſſuring them to obtaine all their iuſt demands, but in caſe they did otherwiſe, he would not faile to ſhew himſelfe protector and defender of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:17208:38"/>
The Proteſtant Princes offered to performe whatſoeuer could bee done with a ſafe conſcience, and if out of the holy Scripture, any errour in their doctrine were ſhewed to correct it, or to make a further declaration, in caſe it were neceſſarie. And becauſe ſome of the points propoſed by them, were granted in the confutation, and ſome reiected, if a copie of the confutations were giuen them, they ſhould be expounded more cleerely.</p>
            <p>After many treaties, ſeuen Catholikes, and ſeuen Proteſtants were choſen, <note place="margin">A Colloquie between the Proteſtants &amp; Catholikes.</note> to conferre together, to find out a meanes of compoſition: who, not being able to agree the number was reſtrained to three a piece. And though ſome few ſmall points of doctrine, and other petty things; belonging to ſome rites, were agreed on, yet in concluſion, it was perceiued, that the conference could produce no concord at all, becauſe neither partie was willing to grant to the other any thing of importance. Many dayes being ſpent in this treatie, the refutation of the Cities confeſſion was read: whereunto their Ambaſſadors anſwered, that many Articles of their writing were repeated otherwiſe then <note place="margin">The anſwer of the Proteſtant Ambaſſadors to the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> they were written by them, &amp; many other things propoſed by them, drawne to a bad ſence, to make them odious: vnto all which obiections they would haue anſwered, if a copie of the confutation had beene giuen them: in the meane time, they prayed them nor to beleeue any calumnie, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their defence. They denyed to giue them a copie, and ſayde that the Emperour would not ſuffer, that the points of Religion ſhould bee put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſputation.</p>
            <p>The Emperour aſſayed by way of canuaſe to perſwade the Princes, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, that they were but few, their doctrine new, that it had been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently confuted in this Diet, that their boldneſſe was great to condemne of errour, hereſie, and falſe religion, the Imperiall Maieſtie, and ſo many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and States of <hi>Germany,</hi> with whom, themſelues beeing compared, made not a number; and which is worſe, to eſteeme alſo for heretikes, their owne fathers and anceſtours, and to demand a Councell, and yet to goe on ſtill in the errours. Theſe perſwaſions auayling nothing, becauſe they denied theirs to be new, and the rites of the Romane Church olde, the Emperour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying other remedies, vnto which he was aduiſed by the Legat <hi>Campeggio,</hi> cauſed euery one to be treated with apart, propoſing vnto them ſome ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in their proper intereſts, and laying before them diuers oppoſitions and croſſes, which he would haue raiſed againſt their proceedings, in caſe they perſiſted in their reſolution, not to reunite themſelues to the Church. But whither thoſe thought to bring about their owne deſignes by perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, or preferred the preſeruation of their Religion, before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intereſt, the perſwaſions, though very potent, produced none effect. Neither could the Emperour obtaine of them, to grant the exerciſe of the Romane religion within their territories, vntill the time of the Councell, which he promiſed ſhould bee intimated within ſixe moneths, becauſe the Proteſtants had diſcouered that this was the inuention of the Popes Legate, who not being able to obtaine his purpoſe for the preſent, thought it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, if by the eſtabliſhing the Romane doctrin in euery place, he put confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion among the people who were alienated already, whereby away might be opened to thoſe accidents which might giue occaſion to roote out the

new. For concerning the promiſe, to intimate a Councell within ſixe moneths, he well knew that many impediments might bee pretended in the very nicke and finally all expectation deluded.</p>
            <p>It being impoſſible to conclude any thing, the Proteſtants departed in the end of October, and the Emperour made an Edict, to eſtabliſh the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient rites of the Roman Catholike religion; which contained in ſumme, <note place="margin">The Edict of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Hee complayned beyond meaſure, that ſome points were agreed vnto, and eſpecially that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the abolition of ſome rites; thinking that the Popes authoritie was violated, when things of ſo great moment were treated of, without his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity: at the leaſt if his Legates authoritie had beene interpoſed, it had beene tollerable. After he conſidered that it was a great preiudice to him, that the Prelates had conſented to it. But the promiſing of a Councell, which hee ſo much abhorred, preſſed him aboue all: in which, though honourable mention were made of his authoritie, yet to ſubſcribe ſixe moneths, to call it, and a yeere to beginne it, was to meddle with that which was proper to the Pope, and to make the Emperor the principall, and the Pope his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. By the obſeruation of theſe beginnings, he concluded that there was little hope in the affayres of <hi>Germany,</hi> and that hee was to thinke of a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, that the diſeaſe might not paſſe to other parts of the body of the Church. And becauſe that which was paſt, could not be yndone, hee thought it not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17208:39"/>
wiſedome to ſhew it was done againſt his will, but to make himſelfe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <note place="margin">1531 CLEMENT 7. CHARLES 5. HENRY 8. FRANCIS 1. He writeth to al Princes that he would call a Councell, though he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer meant it.</note> of it, that he might receiue a leſſe blow in his reputation.</p>
            <p>Therefore he gaue an account of the things paſt to all Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſpatching his letters the firſt of December, all of the ſame tenour, that he hoped the Lutheran hereſie might be extinguiſhed by the preſence of the Emperour, and that principally for that cauſe hee went to <hi>Bolonia</hi> to intreat him for, it, though he knew that of himſelf he was very wel affected that way. But hauing receiued aduice from the Emperour, and from his Legat <hi>Campeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio,</hi> that the Proteſtants are become more obſtinate, hee hath communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the whole to the Cardinals, and together with them, ſeeth cleerely, that there remaineth no other remedie, but that which hath beene vſed by his Predeceſſors, that is a generall Councell. Therefore hee exhorteth them to aſſiſt in the Councell that ſhall be called, either in perſon, or by their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours; a thing ſo holy, that hee is reſolued to put it in execution; ſo ſoone as it is posſible, intimating a generall and free Councell, in ſome fitte place in <hi>Italie.</hi> The Popes letters were knowen to the whole world, becauſe his miniſters endeuoured in euery place to giue notice of them vnto all: not becauſe the Pope or the Court deſired to apply their minds to a Councell, from which they were moſt auerſe, but to entertaine the world; that by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the remedie of the abuſes and inconueniences, they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine conſtant in obedience. Yet few were deceiued; for it was not hard to diſcouer, that to deſire Princes to ſend Ambaſſadours to a Councell, whereof <note place="margin">And his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered by many.</note> neither time, nor place, nor manner was reſolued on, was too much affected preuention.</p>
            <p>But the Proteſtants alſo tooke occaſion by theſe letters to write like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the Kings and Princes: and the next yeere in February they fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">1531 The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants doe write likewiſe to all Princes.</note> a letter to euery one vnder a common name of all, of this tenour. That the old complaint of pious men againſt the vices of the Clergie, noted by <hi>Iohn Gerſon, Nicolas Clemangis,</hi> and others in <hi>France,</hi> and of <hi>Iohn Collet</hi> in <hi>England</hi> and of others elſwhere, was knowen vnto their Maieſties, which alſo happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Germanie</hi> in theſe laſt yeers, by occaſion of the deteſtable &amp; infamous gaine which ſome Friars made by publiſhing Indulgences. And paſſing from this to relate whatſoeuer happened vntill the laſt Diet, they ſaid that their aduerſaries endeuoured to incite the Emperor and other Kings againſt them, vſing diuers calumnies; which as they haue withſtood in <hi>Germanie,</hi> ſo they will more eaſily confute in a generall Councel of the whole world; wherunto they will referre themſelues, ſo that it may be ſuch a one, in which preiudices and paſſion may take no place. That amongſt the Calumnies laid vpon them, this is the principall, that they condemne all Magiſtrates, and vilifie the dignitie of Lawes: which is not onely not true, but, as they haue ſhewed in the Diet of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> their doctrine honoureth Magiſtrates, and defendeth the ſtrength of Lawes, more then euer hath been done in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ages, teaching Magiſtrates that their ſtate and kinde of life is moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, and preaching to the people that they are bound, by Gods commandement to giue honour and obedience to them, and that he wil not leaue vnpuniſhed the diſobedient, becauſe the Magiſtrate hath his gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by diuine ordination. That they haue deſired to ſignifie theſe things
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17208:39"/>
to them, Kings, and Princes, for cleering of themſelues before them, praying them not to beleeue the calumnies, and to ſuſpend their iudgements, vntill thoſe that are accuſed haue place to acquite themſelues publiquely. And therefore they will deſire the Emperour that hee would call a godly and free Councell in <hi>Germanie,</hi> as ſoone as might bee, and not to vſe force, vntill the matter be diſputed, and lawfully defined.</p>
            <p>The French King anſwered with very courteous letters, in ſubſtance, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">The anſwere of the French King to the Proteſtants.</note> them thankes for communicating vnto him a buſineſſe of ſo great weight: he ſhewed them that he was glad to vnderſtand of their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and did approoue the inſtance they made, that the vices might bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, wherein they ſhall finde his Will to concurre with theirs: that their requiring of a Councell was iuſt and holy, yea, neceſſary, not onely for the affayres of <hi>Germany,</hi> but of the whole Church: that it was not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to vſe Armes, where the controuerſies may bee ended with treaties. The letters of the King of <hi>England</hi> were of the ſame Tenour, but that hee <note place="margin">The anſwere of the King of <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> declared in particular, that himſelfe alſo deſired a Councell, and that hee would mediate with <hi>Charles,</hi> to find out a meanes of compoſition.</p>
            <p>The Emperours Decree being knowen throughout all <hi>Germanie,</hi> they began immediatly to accuſe the profeſſors of the new Religion, in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <note place="margin">Sentences were made in the chamber of <hi>Spirae,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> of <hi>Spira,</hi> ſome for zeale, others for reuenge, and ſome alſo to poſſeſſe the goods of their aduerſaries. Many ſentences were made, many declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and many confiſcations againſt Princes, Cities, and priuate men, and none tooke place, but ſome againſt priuate men, whoſe goods were within the territories of Catholiques. By others the ſentences were contemned, with great diminution of the honour, not onely of the Chamber, but of the Emperour alſo; who ſoone perceiued that the remedie was not fitted to themaladie, which increaſed dayly. For the Proteſtant Princes and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (beſides that they eſteemed little the iudgements of the Chamber) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined themſelues together, prepared for their defence, and fortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with forraine intelligences: ſo that it appeared, that in caſe things went on, a Warre would ariſe, dangerous for both parties, and whatſoeuer the iſſue was, pernitious for <hi>Germany.</hi> Wherefore he was willing that ſome Princes ſhould interpoſe, and find out a way of agreement. To this end ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heads and conditions of compoſition were negotiated all this yere 1531, and to giue them ſome concluſion, a Diet at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> was appointed for the next yeere.</p>
            <p>In the meane ſpace, all things remained full of ſuſpitions, and the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zuinglius</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth armes, and is ſlaine.</note> diffidences betweene the one part and the other, rather increaſed. And this yeere alſo, there happened a notable euent among the Suiſſes, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the diſputes between them. For though the controuerſie in religion, betweene <hi>Zuric, Berne,</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> on the one ſide, and the Popiſh Cantons on the other, was often compoſed, by the mediation of diuers, yet at that time the hatred was ſo great between them; and new cauſes of diſtaſts ariſing dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the contentions were often renewed. And this yeere they were greateſt of all, thoſe of <hi>Zuric</hi> and <hi>Berne</hi> attempting to hinder the victualling of fiue Cantons, which cauſed both parties to arme. With thoſe of <hi>Zuric, Zuinglius</hi> tooke armes, though his friendes perſwaded him to remaine at home, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17208:40"/>
leaue that charge to others. Whereunto he would by no meanes yeeld, that <note place="margin">1532 CLEMENT 7. CHARLES 5. HENRY 8. FRANCIS 1.</note> he might not ſeeme to incourage the people in the Church onely, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them in time of danger. The eleuenth of October they came to a ſet battell, in which, thoſe of <hi>Zuric</hi> had the worſt, and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was ſlaine; for which the Catholikes more reioyced, then for the victory. They did diuers diſgraces to the corps, and the death of that man was the chiefeſt cauſe of <note place="margin">Whoſe death cauſed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Cantons.</note> a new compoſition betweene them, both the parties retaining their owne religion. The fiue Catholike Cantons aſſured themſelues, that hee being remoued, who, by his Sermons changed religion in the Countrey, all would returne to the old. In which hope, they were confirmed the more, becauſe <note place="margin">And maketh <hi>Ecolampadius,</hi> die with griefe</note> 
               <hi>Ecolampadius,</hi> a Miniſter in <hi>Baſil,</hi> of the ſame opinion with <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> dyed within a few daies after with griefe, for the loſſe of his friend, the Catholikes attributing the death both of the one and the other, to the prouidence of God, who, compaſſionating the Heluetians, had puniſhed and taken away the Authors of their diſcord Surely it is a pious and religious thought, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the diſpoſition of euery euent, to the prouidence of God: but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to what end thoſe euents are directed, by that high Wiſedom, is not farre from preſumption. Men are ſo ſtraightly and religiouſly wedded to their owne opinions, that they are perſwaded that God loueth and fauoureth them, as much as themſelues. But the things that happened afterwards, ſhewed that the Cantons called Goſpellers, made greater progreſſe in the doctrine receiued, after the death of theſe two: a manifeſt Argument, that it came from a higher cauſe then the labours of <hi>Zuinglius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An agreement betweene the Proteſtants and the others, was negotiated <note place="margin">1532</note> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> by the Electors of <hi>Ments</hi> and the Palatine, and many writings <note place="margin">An agreement betweene the Proteſtants and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes was negotiated, but could not be effected.</note> were made and changed, becauſe they gaue not full ſatisfaction to either of the parties. This made the Emperour reſolue, that a Councell was exceeding neceſſary; and hauing imparted his opinion to the French King, he ſent one to <hi>Rome</hi> by poſt, to treat thereof with the Pope and Colledge of Cardinalls. The Emperour made none account of the place preſcribed, nor of any other ſpecial condition, in caſe <hi>Germany</hi> were ſo ſatisfied that the Proteſtants would <note place="margin">The Emperor doth ſeriouſly negotiate a Councell.</note> be preſent, and ſubmit themſelues, which ſatisfaction the King alſo thought to be iuſt, and offered to ioyne with him. The Ambaſſage was deliuered to the Pope in theſe tearmes, that the Emperor hauing vſed all means to reunite the Proteſtants to the Church, by imploying authority, threats, treaties, and iuſtice alſo, nothing now remaining, but either warre, or a Councell, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he could not take armes, by reaſon of the Turkes preparations againſt him, he was conſtrained to take the other reſolution, and therefore did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech his Holineſſe, that, imitating his Predeceſſours, hee would bee content to graunt a Councell, whereunto the Proteſtants would ſubmit themſelues without difficultie, hauing offered diuers times to ſtand to the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one that is free, in which the Iudges might bee men without partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. The Pope, who by no meanes would haue a Councell, hearing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and not being able to giue a plaine negatiue, made a grant, but ſo as <note place="margin">The Pope conſenteth to the Councell vpon ſuch a condition as hee knew would not bee accepted.</note> that hee knew it would not bee accepted. For the place hee propoſed one of the Cities of the Churches State, naming <hi>Bolonia, Parma, Piacenza,</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties capable to receiue and feed a multitude, healthfull, with a large territory
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17208:40"/>
round about: whither the Proteſtants ought not to make difficultie to got, becauſe they ſhould bee heard: vnto whom hee would giue a full and ample ſafe conduct, and himſelfe would be there in perſon, that euery thing might bee handled with Chriſtian peace, and no man wronged. That hee could by no meanes conſent to celebrate it in <hi>Germanie,</hi> becauſe <hi>Italie</hi> would not indure to be neglected, and <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> who in Eccleſiaſticall matters yeeld vnto <hi>Italie,</hi> for the prerogatiue of the Papacie, which is proper vnto it, would not giue place vnto <hi>Germanie,</hi> and the authoritie of that Councell would bee little eſteemed, where onely Duch-men were preſent, and ſome few of another nation. For vndoubtedly the Italians, French-men, and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards would not bee induced to goe thither. The medicine is not in the power of the ſicke, but of the Phyſitian. Therefore <hi>Germanie</hi> corrupted with the multiplicitie and varietie of opinions, could not giue right iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this ſubiect, as <hi>Italie, France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> which are vncorrupted as yet, and wholly perſeuere in ſubiection to the Apoſtolicall Sea, which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and miſtris of all Chriſtians. For the manner of defining things in the Councell, the Pope ſaid there needed no words, becauſe no difficultie could ariſe therein, except they would make a new forme of a Councell, neuer vſed in the Church. That it was manifeſt, that none had voice in a Councell, by right of the Canon, but Biſhops, and Abbats by cuſtome, and ſome others by the Popes priuiledge: the others that deſire to bee heard, ought to ſubmit themſelues to the determination of theſe; euery Decree being made in the name of the Synod, if the Pope bee not preſent in perſon: but when hee is there, euery Decree paſſeth vnder his name, onely with the approbation of the Fathers of the Synod. The Cardinals likewiſe ſpake in the ſame key, <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals will not beleeue that a Councell is neceſſary.</note> but alwayes interpoſed ſome reaſon, to ſhew that a Councell was not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſo long as the determination of <hi>Leo</hi> ſtood in force, which being execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all would be remedied; and hee that will not referre himſelfe to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Pope, eſpecially accompanied with the counſell of the Cardinals, will much more deſpiſe all Conciliarie Decrees. That it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that the Proteſtants call not a Councell, but onely to gaine time, and to hinder the execution of the Edict of <hi>Wormes.</hi> For they well know that the Councell cannot chooſe but approoue that which <hi>Leo</hi> hath determined, except they would bee a conuenticle, or vnlawfull aſſembly, as all thoſe bee, who haue ſeparated themſelues from the doctrine and obedience of the Pope.</p>
            <p>The Emperours Ambaſſadour, to finde out a meane, had many audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the Pope to chuſe a place in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie</hi> for the Councell, but cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it.</note> with the Pope, and with two Cardinals, deputed by him ouer this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He put him in minde, that neither hee, nor <hi>France,</hi> nor <hi>Spaine,</hi> had neede of a Councell, nor did deſire it; and that therefore it was to no purpoſe to haue reſpect vnto them: that it was ſought for, to cure the diſeaſes of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> vnto which, becauſe it ought to bee proportionated, it was fit to chuſe a place, where all that Nation might bee preſent. That, for other Countreys, the principall ſubiects were ſufficient, becauſe nothing was to bee handled concerning them; that the Cities propoſed; were in all reſpects exceeding fit, but only that they were farre diſtant from <hi>Germanie;</hi> and though the ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Holineſſe ought to ſecure euery one, yet the Proteſtants were
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17208:41"/>
ſuſpicious, for diuers reaſons, both old, and new, amongſt which, they eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not the leaſt, that <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, his couſin, had condemned them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, and declared them heretikes. And although all their reaſons are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued with this onely, that euery one ought to relie vpon the Faith of the Pope, yet his Holineſſe, by his great wiſedome and experience, might know that it was neceſſarie to yeeld to the imperfection of others, and for pitie, to accommodate himſelfe to that, which though in rigour is not due, yet in equitie is conuenient. And concerning the deliberatiue voyces of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, <note place="margin">Who ought to haue voices in Councell.</note> hee diſcourſed, that they being brought in, partly by cuſtome, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by priuiledge, a large field was opened vnto him, to exerciſe his benignitie, by introducing another cuſtome, more fit for the preſent times. For if the Abbots were formerly admitted by cuſtome, becauſe they were more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and intelligent in religion, it is reaſon to grant the ſame now, to perſons of equall or greater learning, though they haue not the title of Abbats. But the priuiledge miniſtreth matter to giue ſatisfaction vnto all. For by gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſame priuiledge to euery one that is able to doe God ſeruice in that congregation, there will bee a Councell exactly pious and Chriſtian, ſuch as the world deſireth. Vnto theſe reaſons anſwere being made, with the motiues before named, the Emperour could obtaine nothing of the Pope; whereby the buſineſſe remained vnperfect for that time, and the Emperour applied himſelfe to ſollicite the treatie of peace alreadie begun: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to a good concluſion, and the Turkiſh warre drawing neere, at the laſt a compoſition was publiſhed the three and twentieth of Iulie, that <note place="margin">A peace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

That the Emperour ſhould procure the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Councell, within ſixe moneths, and the beginning within a yeere; Which if it bee not poſſible, all the States of the Empire ſhould bee called together, to reſolue of what is fit to bee done, as well for the Councell as for other neceſſarie things.

Hee gaue alſo an account to the Catholike Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of the ambaſſage ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> for that end, adding that ſome difficulties of weight could not as yet bee accorded, concerning the manner and place. But he would continue his endeuours that they ſhould bee reſolued, and that the Pope ſhould grant the conuocation; hoping that hee would not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17208:41"/>
to the neceſſitie of the Common-wealth, and his owne duetie: but in caſe this ſucceeded not, hee would intimate another Diet to finde a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die herein.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt libertie of Religion, which thoſe that adhered to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> confeſſion, called the Auguſtan, obteined by publique decree: whereof the world talked diuerſly. At <hi>Rome</hi> the Emperor was reprehended, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">The firſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the Auguſtan confeſſion.</note> his ſickle (as they ſayd) into another mans harueſt, euery Prince being obliged, by the ſtricteſt bonds of cenſures, to the extirpation of thoſe that are condemned by the Pope: wherein they ought to ſpend their goods, ſtate, and life: and the Emperours much more, becauſe they doe ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſweare vnto it. This not being performed by <hi>Charles,</hi> an example not heard of, there was cauſe to feare a ſudden reuenge from heauen. But others commended the pietie and wiſedome of the Emperour, who laboured more to preuent the danger, imminent to Chriſtendom, by the armes of the Turke, a direct oppoſer of Religion; againſt whom hee could not haue made reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance without ſecuring the Proteſtants, who are Chriſtians too, though diſſenting from others, in ſome particular rites, which is a tolerable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. That the <hi>Maxime,</hi> ſo renowned in <hi>Rome,</hi> that it is more meete to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute heretikes, then infidels, was wel fitted to the Popes dominion, but not to the benefit of Chriſtendome. Some alſo, not regarding the Turkes, ſaid that Kingdomes and Principalities, ought not to bee gouerned by the lawes and intereſts of Prieſts, who are more partiall, for their owne greatneſſe and profits, then any other, but according to the exigence of the publike good, which requireth now and then, the tolerating of ſome defect. That it was the duetie of euery Chriſtian Prince, to indeuour equally, that his Subiects maintaine the true faith, as alſo that they obſerue all the Commandements of God, and not this, more then that. But when a vice cannot bee rooted out, without the ruine of the State, it is acceptable to the Maieſtie of God to permit it: neither is the obligation greater to puniſh heretikes, then forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators; who if they be tolerated, for publike quiet, it is no greater inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, if thoſe bee permitted, who defend not all our opinions. And though it bee not eaſie to alleadge examples of Princes, which haue done this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe 800. yeeres, yet hee that will conſider the times before, will ſee it done by all, and laudably too, when neceſſitie hath required.

HENRY 8. FRANCIS 1.</note> haue taught, and will teach perpetually, that the Emperours reſolution was conformable to the lawes of God and man. The Pope, who was more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled herein then all others, as one who was moſt intelligent in State affaires, ſaw very well that he had no reaſon to complaine; but hee concluded here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, that his intereſts could not concurre with thoſe of the Emperour, and <note place="margin">The Pope is aliened againe from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> therefore his minde was wholly aliened from him.</p>
            <p>The Turke being chaſed out of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Emperor paſſed into <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; had conference with the Pope in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> where they treated of all the common affaires: and though the league was renewed betweene them, yet the Pope was not fully ſatisfied, both for the liberty of Religion granted in <hi>Germanie,</hi> as <note place="margin">The league is renewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, but ſuſpicions remaine in the Popes minde.</note> hath been ſaid, and becauſe they agreed not concerning the Councell, as might cure the mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of <hi>Germany,</hi> (in conformity to his Ambaſſadors propoſition the yeere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) which was impoſſible if the Proteſtants had no part therein. The Pope continued in his reſolution, not to admit of a Councell by any meanes, but in caſe of neceſſitie, and which ſhould not be celebrated out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and wherein none ſhould haue a deliberatiue voice but thoſe vnto whom the Popes lawes did allow it. The Emperor would haue condeſcended to the Popes will, if there had been meanes to giue the Proteſtants contentment; wherein that he might giue his Holineſſe certaine information, he propoſed vnto him that he <note place="margin">The Pope and Emperour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue to ſend a Nuncio and an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie.</hi>

            <p>The Pope after Eaſter 1533. ſent <hi>Hugo Rangone,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rheggio,</hi> to execute the propoſition accepted by him: who comming with the Emperors Ambaſſador to <hi>Iohn Frederic,</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> (who had ſucceeded his decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed father a few moneths before) as chiefe of the Proteſtants, declared his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; that <hi>Clement</hi> from the beginning of his Papacie, had alwayes an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary deſire to compoſe the differences in Religion, ſprung vp in <hi>Germany,</hi> and for that end had ſent thither many learned perſons; and though their paines tooke not effect, the Pope notwithſtanding had hope, that at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours going thither after his coronation, all would be brought to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But hauing not obteined the end he deſired, the Emperor returned into <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſhewed him that there was no fitter meanes then a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, which the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> deſired alſo. With which the Pope being well pleaſed, as well for the publique good, as to giue the Emperour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, had ſent him, to agree with them, concerning the manner of the future Councell, and of the time and place. And for the forme and order thereof, the Pope propoſed ſome neceſſary conditions.</p>
            <p>The firſt, that it ſhould bee free and generall, as the Fathers were woont
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17208:42"/>
to celebrate it in former times. Then, that thoſe that demand a Councell, ſhould promiſe and giue aſſurance to receiue the decrees that ſhall be made. For otherwiſe it would bee labour in vaine, it being to no purpoſe to make lawes, which would not be obſerued. Thirdly, that he hat could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſhould ſend Ambaſſadors to make promiſe, &amp; put in caution. After this, that it was neceſſary, that in the meane while, all things remained as they are, <note place="margin">The conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Councell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Pope.</note> and that no innouation were made before the Councel. The Nuncio added, that for the place the Pope had not long, frequent, and great conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For it was neceſſary to prouide one that ſhould bee fertill to afforde victuals to ſo famous a concourſe, and of an healthfull ayre too, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe may not bee hindered by ſickeneſſe. And in concluſion <hi>Piaconza,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Places for the Councel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Nuncio.</note> 
               <hi>Bolonia,</hi> or <hi>Mantua</hi> ſeemed vnto him very commodious, leauing it to the choice of <hi>Germanie</hi> to elect which of theſe places they would. But he added that if any Prince would not come, or not ſend Ambaſſadours, it would beeiuſt for all the others to defend the Church. In the end hee concluded, that if <hi>Germanie</hi> would giue a fit anſwere to the propoſitions, the Pope would immediately treate with other Kings, and would intimate the Councell within ſixe moneths, to begin a yeere after, that prouiſion of victuals might be made, and that all, eſpecially the fartheſt diſtant, might prepare themſelues for the voyage.</p>
            <p>The Nuncio gaue vp his propoſition in writing, and the Emperours <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the ſame negotiation.</note> Ambaſſadour made the ſame negotiation with the Elector; who, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired time to anſwere, the Nuncio was infinitely pleaſed. For hee deſired nothing but delay, and tooke the anſwere for a preſage of the happy ſucceſſe of the buſineſſe: and hee could not refraine to commend him, for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too haſtie in a deliberation which deſerued time. Yet the Elector an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered within few dayes, that hee was very glad that the Emperonr and the Pope were reſolued to call a Councell, where, according to promiſe, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes made vnto <hi>Germanie,</hi> the controuerſies might lawfully bee handled, by the rule of the word of God. That himſelfe for his owne part, would willingly make preſent anſwere to the things propoſed; but becauſe there are many Princes, which haue receiued the ſame confeſſion in the Diet of <hi>Ausbug,</hi> it was not fit, nor profitable for the cauſe, to anſwere alone: but an aſſembly being intimated againſt the 24. of Iune, hee deſired hee would bee contented to grant this ſhort delay, that he might receiue a more common, and reſolute concluſion. The ioy and hope of the Nuncio was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, <note place="margin">The Nuncio is pleaſed with the delatory anſwere. The anſwere of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calde.</hi>
               </note> who deſired the delay had been rather of yeeres then moneths. But the Proteſtants, aſſembled at the aforeſaid time in <hi>Smalcalde,</hi> anſwered, than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Emperor, that, for the glory of God, and ſafetie of the common-wealth, hee had taken paines to cauſe a Councell to bee celebrated; which would bee in vaine, if conditions were not obſerued, neceſſary for the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the diſeaſes of <hi>Germanie:</hi> which deſireth that her controuerſies may be defined with due order: and hopeth to obtaine it, for that the Emperour hath in many imperiall Diets promiſed ſuch a one, which, by the mature deliberation of the Princes and States, hath been reſolued ſhould be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Germanie;</hi> in regard that many errors being reuealed, by occaſion of the Indulgences, publiſhed in Sermons, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> condemned the doctrine
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17208:43"/>
and the Doctors, who diſcouered the abuſes. But that ſentence was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the teſtimonies of the Prophets and Apoſtles. Whence did ariſe the controuerſie, which cannot be decided but in a Councell, where the Popes ſentence, or the power of whoſoeuer, may not preiudice the cauſe, and where iudgement may be giuen, not according to the Popes lawes, or opinions of the Schooles, but according to the holy Scripture. If this be not performed, this ſo great a labour would bee taken in vaine, as may appeare by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſome other Councels, celebrated before.</p>
            <p>Now the propoſitions of the Pope were contrary to this end, to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of the Diet, and promiſes of the Emperour. For though hee propoſe <note place="margin">And their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the propoſitions of the Pope.</note> a free Councell in words, yet in effect hee would haue it tied, ſo that vices and errors may not be reprehended, and himſelfe may maintaine his power. That that was not a reaſonable demand that any man ſhould bind himſelfe to obſerue the decrees, before he know by what order, maner, or forme they are made, whether the Pope deſire to haue the ſupreme authoritie in him, and his; whether hee will haue the controuerſies diſcuſſed according to holy writ, or according to humane lawes and traditions. That that clauſe alſo ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med captious, that the Councell ſhould bee made according to the old cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome. For it being vnderſtood of that old, when all was determined by the holy Scriptures, they would not refuſe it. But the Councels of the next preceding age were much different from the other that were more ancient, where too much was attributed to the Decrees of Popes, and other men. That the propoſe was glorious, but it tooke abſolutely away the libertie which was demanded, and was neceſſary for the cauſe. That they deſired the Emperour to bee a meanes that all might paſſe lawfully. That all men were in attention, and ſtood in hope of a Councell, and demanded it with vowes and prayers, which would bee turned into great ſorrow and vexation of minde, if this expectation ſhould bee deluded, by giuing a Councell, but not ſuch a one as is deſired and promiſed. That there is no doubt but that all the States of the Empire, and other Kings and Princes alſo will bee of the ſame opinion, to auoid thoſe ſnares and bonds, with which the Pope think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to binde them in a new Councell: to whoſe will if the managing of the affaires ſhall be permitted, they will referre the whole to God, and thinke of what they haue to doe. Yet for all this if they ſhall bee cited, with good and lawfull aſſurance, in caſe they ſee themſelues able to doe ſome thing for the ſeruice of God, they will not refuſe to appeare; but with condition, not to conſent to the Popes demands, nor to a Councell which is not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Decrees of the imperiall Diets. In the end they prayed the Emperour not to take their reſolution in ill part, and to endeuour that the power of thoſe be not confirmed, who long ſince haue waxed cruell againſt the innocent.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants reſolued, not onely to ſend the anſwere to the Pope, and the Emperour, but to print it alſo, together with the Nuncio his propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which by the ſame Pope was iudged indiſcreete, and too open. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">The Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calleth <hi>Hugo Rangone</hi> B. of <hi>Rheggio,</hi> his Nuncio, and putteth <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerius</hi> in his place.</note> vnder colour that hee was old and vnable to beare that charge, he recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, and wrote to <hi>Vergerius,</hi> Nuncio with King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that he ſhould take vpon him that place, with the ſame inſtructions, admoniſhing him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

            <p>While theſe things were in handling, the Pope who fore-ſaw the anſwere which would come out of <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp; before in <hi>Bolonia</hi> had conceiued but ſmall confidence in the Emperour, wholly aliened himſelfe from his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. For in the cauſe of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Rheggio,</hi> betweene his Holineſſe and the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> referred to him by the parties: hee pronounced for the Duke. For all which cauſes, the Pope negotiated a confederation with the French King; the which was concluded, and eſtabliſhed alſo by the mariage <note place="margin">The confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Pope and the French King, is confirmed by marriage.</note> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Kings ſecond ſonne, with <hi>Catherine de Medici,</hi> the Popes great grand-child. And to giue a compleat perfection to the whole buſineſſe, hee went to <hi>Marſeilles</hi> in perſon, to ſpeake with the King. But vnderſtanding that this iourney was reprehended by all, as not addreſſed to any publike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, but onely to make his houſe great, hee iuſtified himſelfe, by ſaying hee vndertooke it, to perſwade him to fauour the Councell, and to aboliſh the Lutheran hereſie. And tis true that there, beſide other treaties, hee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded his moſt Chriſtian Maieſtie, to deale with the Proteſtants, eſpecially with the Landgraue of <hi>Haſsia,</hi> who was to come to him into <hi>France,</hi> to cauſe them to deſiſt from demaunding a Councel, propoſing vnto them, that they would ſeeke out any other way to accommodate the differences, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing his owne faithfull and effectuall helpe, when time ſhould ſerue.</p>
            <p>The King did thus negotiate, but could obtaine nothing.

In the ſecond place, the King treated with them, that they would be contented with a Councell in <hi>Italie.</hi> But neither did the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans agree vnto this; for they ſayd, that this match was worſe then the firſt: becauſe that conſtrained them onely to make warre, but this caſt them into a ſeruitude both of body and ſoule: whereunto reſiſtance could not be made, but by a Councell, in a free place: yet condeſcending for his Maieſties ſake, to whatſoeuer they were able, they would ceaſe to demand to haue it celebrated in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo that another free place were appointed out of <hi>Italie,</hi> though it were neere vnto it.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the yeere 1534. the King gaue the Pope an account <note place="margin">1534</note> of what hee had done, and offered to bring to paſſe, that the Proteſtants ſhould bee contented with <hi>Geneua.</hi> The Pope hauing receiued the aduiſe, <note place="margin">The Pope is diſpleaſed with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua</hi> for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Catherine Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſiſter to the mother of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, was married to <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and was before, the wife of <hi>Arthure,</hi> Prince of <hi>Walles, Henryes</hi> eldeſt brother; after whoſe death, their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gaue her in marriage to <hi>Henry,</hi> who remained ſucceſſor, by the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation <note place="margin">The cauſe.</note> of Pope <hi>Iulio</hi> the ſecond. This Queene was with child often, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes either miſcaried, or brought foorth a creature of a ſhort life, except one only daughter, King <hi>Henry,</hi> either for diſpleaſure againſt the Emperor, or for deſire of iſſue male, or for ſome other cauſe, conceiued a ſcruple in his mind that the mariage was not good; and taking counſell of his Biſhops, ſeparated himſelfe from her company. The Biſhops treated with the Queene, that ſhee would be contented with a diuorce, ſaying that the Popes diſpenſation was neither good nor true. The Queene would not giue eare to them, but had recourſe to the Pope: to whom, the King alſo ſent to craue a diuorce. The Pope, who was ſtill retired in <hi>Oruieto,</hi> and hoped for good conditions in his affaires, if the fauours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> which ſtill they performed, were continued, by moleſting the Emperour in the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> ſent into <hi>England</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Campeggio,</hi> delegating the cauſe vnto him, and the <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Yorke.</hi> From theſe, and from <hi>Rome,</hi> the King had hope gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, that in the end, the ſentence ſhould bee on his ſide: Yea, to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals <hi>Campeg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio</hi> and <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi> were dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the Pope to heare the cauſe of the Kings di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce.</note> the reſolution, that the ſolemnities of the iudgement, might not draw the cauſe in length, a briefe was framed, in which, hee was declared free from that marriage, with the moſt ample clauſes, that euer were put into any Popes Bull, and a Cardinall ſent into <hi>England,</hi> with order to preſent it, after ſome few proofes were paſt, which he was ſure would eaſily be made. And <note place="margin">The Pope cauſed his Briefe which he had made in fauour of the diuorce to be burned.</note> this happened in the yeere 1524.

And the diſputation grew vpon the Article of the Attentats, in which the Pope gaue ſentence againſt the King; declaring, that it was not lawfull for him, by his owne authoritie, without the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge, to ſeparate himſelfe from his wife. For which cauſe, the King in the beginning of this yeere 1534 denied the Pope obedience, commanding all his ſubiects, not to carry any money to <hi>Rome,</hi>

For which cauſe all being inflamed with choler, they ran head-long to giue ſentence; which was pronounced in the Conſiſtorie, the foure and twentieth of the ſame moneth, that the mariage betweene <hi>Henry</hi> and Queene <hi>Catherine</hi> was good, that he was bound to take her for his wife, and that, in caſe he did it not, he ſhould be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated.</p>
            <p>The Pope was ſoone diſpleaſed with this precipitation. For ſixe dayes after, the French King his letters came, that the King of <hi>England</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to accept the ſentence concerning the <hi>Attentates,</hi> and to render obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with condition, that the Cardinals whom hee miſtruſted ſhould not meddle in the buſineſſe, and that perſons not ſuſpected, ſhould bee ſent to <hi>Cambray</hi> to take information. And the King had ſent his Proctors before, to aſſiſt in the cauſe at <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherefore the Pope went about to deuiſe ſome pretence, to ſuſpend the precipitated ſentence, and againe to ſet the cauſe on its feete.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Henry</hi> ſo ſoone as he had ſeene it, ſayd it was no matter. For the Pope ſhould be Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and himſelfe ſole Lord of his kingdome: and that he would doe according to the ancient faſhion of the Eaſtern Church, not leauing to be a good Chriſtian, nor ſuffering the Lutheran hereſie, or any other to be brought into his kingdome. And ſo he did. Hee publiſhed an Edict, wherein hee declared himſelfe head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and puniſhed capitally, whoſoeuer ſaid that the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> had any authoritie there: he chaſed out the Collector of the Peter-pence, and cauſed the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to approoue all theſe things: where it was determined, that all Biſhoprickes of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould bee conferred by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie,</hi>

without ſending to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the Clergie ſhould pay to the King one hundred and fifty thouſand pounds ſterling yeerely, for the defence of the Kingdome againſt whoſoeuer.</p>
            <p>This action of the King was variouſly expounded. Some thought him wiſe, for freeing himſelfe from the ſubiection of <hi>Rome,</hi> without any innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Religion, and without putting his ſubiects in danger of ſedition, <note place="margin">How the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of K <hi>Henry</hi> was expo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> maintained that it could not be ſaid, that there was no change in Religion, the firſt and principal Article being changed, which is the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of the Pope, and that ſeditions would ariſe as well for this onely, as for all the reſt. Which the euent ſhewed to be true. For the King was faine to proceede ſeuerely againſt ſome of his ſubiects, whom he loued and eſteemed. It cannot be expreſſed what griefe was conceiued in <hi>Rome,</hi> and by all the Clergie, for the alienation of ſo great a Kingdome from the Popes ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and it diſcouered the imbecillitie of humane affaires, wherein, for the moſt part, great damages proceed from thoſe things, from which the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <note place="margin">The Popes haue gained much by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations.</note> benefits were formerly receiued. For by matrimonial diſpenſations, and by ſentences of diuorce, as well granted as denyed, the Papacie hath gained much in former times, ſheltering the Princes with the name of the Vicar of Chriſt, whom it concerned with ſome inceſtuous mariage, or by diſſoluing one to contract another, to vnite ſome other territory to their owne, or to drowne the title of diuers pretendants, making, for this cauſe, ſtraight alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them, and intereſting their power to defend that authoritie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which their actions would be condemned and hindred: yea, intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not thoſe Princes onely, but all their poſteritie, to maintaine their legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But the miſfortune which then aroſe, might be aſcribed to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation of <hi>Clement,</hi> who, in this caſe, knew not how to manage his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: and if it had pleaſed God to haue giuen him in this fact the vſe of his vſuall wiſdome, he might haue gained much, where now his loſſe was great.</p>
            <p>But the Emperour at his returne into <hi>Germany,</hi> being informed of the negotiation of the Nuncio <hi>Rangone,</hi> concerning the Councell, wrote to <hi>Rome,</hi> complaining that himſelfe hauing promiſed a Councell to <hi>Germany,</hi> and treated with the Pope in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> in what ſort the Princes ſhould be dealt with in this matter, yet the Nuncij of his Holineſſe had not procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that manner that was agreed of, but had ſo treated, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants thought themſelues deluded: praying him in the ende, to finde ſome way to giue <hi>Germany</hi> ſatisfaction.

But the Pope and maior part of the Cardinals, ſeeing it was impoſſible to make the Lutherans accept ſuch a Counſell, as might bee ſeruiceable to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and being reſolute not ſo much as to hearken to any ſpeach of making it otherwiſe, they reſolued to anſwere the Emperour, that they knew very well the importance of the times, and what great need there was of a generall Councell: which they were moſt readie to intimate, in caſe it might be ſo celebrated, that it might produce good effects, as need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth: but ſeeing new diſcords ariſe betweene him and <hi>France,</hi> diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen diſſentions betweene other Chriſtian Princes, it was neceſſarie they ſhould ceaſe, and mindes ſhould bee reconciled, before the Councel were called. For, during the diſcords it could not produce any good effect, and now leaſt of all, the Lutherans being in armes, and made proud by the victory of <hi>Wittenberg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it was neceſſary to leaue diſcourſing with the Pope of a Councell: For hee fell into a long and mortall infirmitie, whereof he dyed in the end <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Clement</hi> the 7. dieth.</note> of September, with no ſmall ioy of the Court.

A Prelate indowed with good qualities, &amp; among all his vertues, made more eſteeme of none then of diſſimulation. He being a Cardinall practiſed in ſixe Popedomes, Deane of the Colledge, and much conuerſant in negotiations, ſhewed that he did not feare the Councel, as <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> did, but thought it profitable for the Papacie, to make ſhew by al means of deſiring it, being aſſured that hee could not bee enforced to call it in ſuch maner, and in ſuch a place where hee could haue no aduantage, and when there was cauſe to hinder it, the contradiction which the Court and Clergie would make, was ſufficient. He thought alſo that this might ſerue to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine peace in <hi>Italie,</hi> which he eſteemed very neceſſary, that hee might go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17208:46"/>
in quiet. Hee ſaw very well that this colour of a Councell might ſerue to couer many matters, and to excuſe him in not doing thoſe things which were contrary to his will. Therefore ſoone after his Creation he let them knowe, that though the capitulations were not ſworne, yet hee was reſolued to obſerue that of the conuocation of a Councell, knowing it to be neceſſarie for the glory of God, and benefite of the Church: and the 16. of the ſame moneth he made a generall congregation of the Cardinals, which is not called a Conſiſtory, the Pope not being crowned as yet, where hee propoſed this matter. Hee ſhewed, by potent arguments, that the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <note place="margin">He maketh ſhew that he deſireth a Councell.</note> could not bee deferred, it being otherwiſe impoſſible to make true amitie betweene Chriſtian Princes, and to extirpate the hereſies: and that therefore all the Cardinals ought maturely to conſider how it ſhould bee celebrated. Hee deputed alſo three Cardinals to aduice of the time, and place, and other particulars, with order to deliuer their opinion in the firſt Conſiſtory after the coronation. And to make contradictions ariſe, which might ſerue him in occaſions, hee added, that as he would reforme the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie in the Councell, ſo it was not conuenient there ſhould be need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Cardinals, but that it was neceſſarie they ſhould then begin to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme <note place="margin">Perſwadeth the Cardinals to reforme themſelues.</note> themſelues, becauſe he was reſolued to draw fruit from the Councell, the precepts whereof would bee of ſmall force, if the effects appeared not firſt in the Cardinals.</p>
            <p>The cuſtom is, that in the firſt daies the Cardinals, eſpecially the great ones, obtaine fauours eaſily of the new Pope. Therefore the Cardinal of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">And reſuſeth to grant the nomination of Biſhops and Abbats to any Prince.</note> and other French, in the name of the King, deſired him to grant to the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> the nomination of the Biſhoprickes, and Abbacies of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: which demand alſo it was thought the Venetians would make for theirs. The Popes anſwere was, that in the Councell, which ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſhortly, it was neceſſarie to take away the facultie of nomination from thoſe Princes that already had it; which was ſome blemiſh to the Popes his Predeceſſors, who had granted them. Therefore it was not reaſonable to augment the heape of errours, and to grant that now which ſhortly ſhould bee reuoked with ſmall reputation.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Conſiſtory, which was the twelfth of Nouember, hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed againe of the Councell, and ſayd, that firſt it was neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine an vnion of Chriſtian Princes, or aſſurance of ſuſpenſion of armes, <note place="margin">The Pope maketh ſhew to deſire an vnion of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Court.</note> while the Councell ſhould endure. Therefore that hee would ſend <hi>Nuncij</hi> to all Princes to negotiate this point, and other particulars, of which the Cardinals put him in minde. Hee called alſo <hi>Vergerius</hi> out of <hi>Germany,</hi> to be well informed of the State of thoſe Prouinces, and deputed three Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, <note place="margin">

To thoſe that told him of their youth, hee anſwered, that his owne decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite olde age did ſupply it. The hope of reforming the Cardinals, and the feare of ſome of them vaniſhed immediately, becauſe it did not appeare how it could begin, but from the age, and lawfull birth of thoſe which were to be created.

Yet the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of calling a Councell was currant ſtill.</p>
            <p>And in the Conſiſtorie of the ſixteenth of Ianuarie 1535. hee made a long <note place="margin">1535</note> and vehement Oration, exciting the Cardinals to reſolue in that matter.

In that conſiſtorie it was reſolued to diſpatch Nuncij to the Emperour, to the French King, and other Chriſtian Princes, with commiſſion to declare, that the Pope and Colledge had determined abſolutely, for the benefit of Chriſtendome, to celebrate a Councell, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to fauour it, and to procure peace and tranquillitie, while it ſhall laſt, but to tell them, that for the time and place, his Holineſſe was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued as yet. And the moſt ſecret inſtruction was, that they ſhould cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly finde out, what the Princes thought concerning the place, to the end, that all their intereſts and purpoſes being knowen, hee might hinder them, by oppoſing one againſt another, and ſo worke his owne will.

Hee added alſo that hee would not diſpute with him of the controuerſies, becauſe hee profeſſed not Diuinitie, but that by common reaſon hee could ſhew him that it was good to reunite himſelfe with the head of the Church. For conſidering that his doctrine, comming to light, and being publiſhed within theſe eighteene yeeres had rayſed innumerable ſects, of which the one deteſteth the other, and ſo many popular ſeditions, with the death and baniſhment of ſo great multitudes, it could not bee concluded that it came from God.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ergerius</hi> ſaid, that it was too great a ſelfe-loue, and too great a conceipt of ones owne worth, when a man would trouble the whole world to ſowe his owne opinions. If you haue innouated in the faith, (ſaid <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ergerius)</hi> in which you were borne, and bred vp 35. yeeres, for your conſcience and ſaluations ſake, it was ſufficient to keepe it within your ſelfe. If the loue of your neighbour mooued you, why did you trouble the whole world vnneceſſarily, ſeeing that, without it men did liue, and God was ſerued in tranquillity? Hee added that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion was gone on ſo farre, that the remedie could not be deferred. The Pope is reſolute to applie it by calling a Councell, where all the learned men of <hi>Europe</hi> meeting together, the trueth ſhall bee cleered, to the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of vnquiet ſpirits, and for the place, hath deſtinated the Citie of <hi>Mantua.</hi> And although the chiefeſt hope conſiſteth in the goodneſſe of God, yet put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to that account the endeuours of men, it was in <hi>Luthers</hi> power, to make the remedie eaſie, if hee will bee preſent, treat with charitie, and oblige to himſelfe alſo the Pope, a munificent Prince, who taketh ſpeciall notice of perſons of merit. Hee put him in minde of the example of <hi>Eneas Siluius,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">And propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vnto him the example of <hi>Aentas Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius.</hi>

               </note>

            <p>
               <hi>Luthers</hi> anſwers were, according to his nature, vehement and fierce, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> ſaying, that hee made no account of the eſteeme which hee had with the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe hatred hee feared not, nor regarded their good will; that hee applied himſelfe to the ſeruice of God, as much as hee could, though vvhen he had done all, he vvas but an vnprofitable ſeruant; that hee ſavv not hovv the ſeruices of God vvere ioyned vvith thoſe of the Papacy, but as dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vvith light; that nothing in all his life vvas more profitable to him, then the rigor of <hi>Leo,</hi> &amp; the rigidity of <hi>Caietan,</hi> vvhich he could not aſcribe to them, but to the prouidence of God. For not being as yet in thoſe times illuminated
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17208:48"/>
in all the trueth of Chriſtian faith, but hauing onely diſcouered the abuſes of Indulgences, hee was ready to haue kept ſilence, in caſe his aduerſaries had done the like. But the writings of the maſter of the holy palace, the inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Caietan,</hi> and the rigor of <hi>Leo</hi> conſtrained him to ſtudie, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriemany other leſſe tolerable abuſes, and errors of the Papacie, which he could not diſſemble, nor refraine to declare them vnto the world with a good conſcience. That the Nuncio had ingenuouſly confeſſed that hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not Diuinitie; which appeared cleerely by the reaſons which hee propoſed becauſe none could call his doctrine new, but hee that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that CHRIST, the Apoſtles, and the holy Fathers liued, as now the Pope, Cardinals, and Biſhops doe. Neither can any argument be drawen againſt the doctrine, from the ſeditions happened in <hi>Germanie,</hi> but by him that hath not read the Scriptures, and knoweth not that this is proper to the word of God, and the Goſpel, that it ſtirreth vp troubles and tumults, euen to the ſeparation of the father from the ſonne, whereſoeuer it is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. That this was the vertue of it, to giue life to them that hearken to it, and to bring greater damnation to whoſoeuer reiecteth it. Hee added, that it was a great fault of the Romaniſts, to eſtabliſh the Church with gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments taken from humane reaſons, as if it were a temporall State. That this is that kind of wiſedome, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, is accounted fooliſhneſſe with God, as not to eſteeme thoſe politique reaſons, by which <hi>Rome</hi> doth gouerne, but to truſt in Gods promiſes, and to referre to his Maieſtie the managing of the Church affaires, is that humane folly, which is wiſedome with God. That to make the Councell take good effect, and to bee profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the Church, was not in the power of <hi>Martin,</hi> but of him that can make it free, that the Spirit of God may rule there, and guide it, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture may bee the rule of the reſolutions, not bringing thither inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, vſurpations, and artifices of men: which in caſe it ſhould happen, yet himſelfe would there vſe all ſinceritie, and Chriſtian charitie, not to binde the Pope or any other vnto him, but for the ſeruice of Chriſt, and peace and libertie of the Church. But that hee could not hope to ſee ſo great a good ſo long as it appeared not that the wrath of God was appeaſed, by a ſerious conuerſion from hypocriſie. That no ſound argument could bee taken from the aſſembling of learned men, ſeeing that ſo long as the anger of God is kindled, there is no error ſo abſurd and vnreaſonable, which Satan can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perſwade, eſpecially to thoſe great wiſe men, who thinke they know much, whom the Maieſtie of God will confound. That nothing can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from <hi>Rome</hi> compatible with the miniſtery of the Goſpell. That the examples of <hi>Eneas Siluius,</hi> and <hi>Beſſarion</hi> mooued him not. For hee eſteemeth not thoſe cloudy glitterings, and, in caſe hee would exalt himſelfe, he might truely reply that which facetely was ſpoken by <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> that <hi>Luther</hi> beeing poore and baſe, maketh rich, and aduanceth many. That it was well knowen to the Nuncio himſelfe, (not to goe farre) that the laſt May himſelfe had a great part in the creation of the Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and was the totall cauſe of the creation of <hi>Scomberg.</hi> That if the life of the firſt was ſo ſoone ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, this was to bee aſcribed to the prouidence of God. <hi>

               </note> and thoſe that rendred themſelues were of ſmall worth, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much, ſo that they were not for his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But the Proteſtants, vnderſtanding <hi>Vergerius</hi> his propoſition, there beeing fifteene Princes, and thirtie Cities aſſembled in <hi>Smalcalda,</hi> anſwered that they had declared their reſolution concerning the Councell in many Diets, and laſt of all to the Nuncio of Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> and the Emperours Ambaſſadours, two yeeres ſince, and that ſtill they deſired a lawfull Councell as they were ſure that all godly men did, and that they would goe to it, as many times hath beene determined in the Imperiall Diets. But for the Councell which the Pope hath appointed to bee in <hi>Mantua,</hi> they hoped that the Emperour would not breake the decrees of the Diet, nor his owne promiſes, ſo often made vnto them, that the Councell ſhould bee celebrated in <hi>Germany;</hi> and that they ſaw not how there could bee any danger there, ſeeing that all the Princes and Cities obey the Emperour, and are ſo well gouerned, that all ſtrangers are receiued and entertained with all humanity. But that the Pope ſhould prouide for the ſecuritie of thoſe that went to the Councel they could not ſee how, eſpeciall conſidering what things haue happened in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent age. That the Chriſtian Commonwealth hath neede of a godly and free Councell, and that to ſuch a one they haue appealed. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Nuncio ſayd, that they ought not to treat of the manner and forme firſt, it ſignified nothing but that there ſhould bee no libertie, and that all ſhould bee referred to the Popes power, who already hauing ſo often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned their religion, the Councell cannot bee free, if hee ſhall bee Iudge. That the Councell is not the tribunall of the Pope and Prieſts onely, but of all the orders of the Church, not excluding the Seculars. That to preferre the Popes power before the authoritie of the whole Church, is an vniuſt and tyrannicall opinion. That the Pope defending the opinion of his owne men, yea with cruell edicts, making himſelfe a party to the cauſe, it is iuſt that the manner and forme of the proceſſe ſhould bee determined by the Princes.</p>

               <hi>Smalcalda:</hi> the French King (who had a diſſeigne to make warre in <hi>Italy, Francis Sforza</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan;</hi> beeing now dead) deſired them not to accept of any place for the Councel, without the aduiſe of him, and of the King of <hi>England,</hi> and that they would accept of none without them. The King of <hi>England</hi> aduiſed them to be aware that they called not ſuch a Councel, where, in ſtead of moderating the abuſe, they ſhould more eſtabliſh the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and deſired them to approoue his diuorce.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ergerius</hi> counſell, ſaid there was no meanes to bee vſed but warre. But the Emperor, ſeeing the time not ripe as yet, to reape from thence <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour goeth to <hi>Rome</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with the Pope.</note> that good fruit, as others were perſwaded he might, and himſelfe alſo intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Italy,</hi> without poſſibility of being free, but by yeelding <hi>Milan,</hi> which he reſolued, by all meanes to make his owne, whither all his actions did prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally tend, alleaged for a reaſon to deferre that warre, that it was more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to defend <hi>Milan</hi> from the French men. On the other ſide the Pope, whoſe thoughts were wholly bent to make an Italian Lord of that State, and therefore propoſed the warre of <hi>Germanie,</hi> not ſo much to ſuppreſſe the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans (as hee ſaid openly) as to diuert <hi>Caeſar</hi> from poſſeſſing <hi>Milan,</hi> which was his principall end, though ſecret, replyed that himſelfe and the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, what by armes, and what by treaties, would more eaſily make the King deſiſt, in caſe his Imperiall Maieſtie did not meddle.</p>
            <p>The Emperour hauing diſcouered the inward thoughts of the Pope, <note place="margin">The Pope and Emperor haue contrary ends and diſſemble one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> with as much diſſimulation, made ſhew hee was perſwaded, and inclined to the warre of <hi>Germanie;</hi> yet hee ſaid, that it was fit to iuſtifie the cauſe well, that the whole world might not be againſt him, and to ſhew, by intimating a Councell, that hee had firſt vſed all other meanes. The Pope was not ſory that, being neceſſarily to intimate a Synode, it ſhould be done in a time, when, in regard the <hi>French</hi> King had inuaded <hi>Sauoy</hi> and <hi>Piemont,</hi> all <hi>Italy</hi> would bee ſet on fire with warre; whereby an apparent pretence was giuen him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiron the Councell with armes, vnder colour of cuſtody and protection. He <note place="margin">The Emperor is puffed vp with the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> victorie.</note> ſhewed himſelfe to bee contented, ſo that ſuch conditions were ſet downe which might not derogate from the authority and reputation of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Sea. The Emperour, who, by reaſon of the victory atchieued in <hi>Africa,</hi> was lifted vp in minde, and ſwollen with vaſt thoughts, beleeued hee ſhould make an end of the warre in <hi>Lombardy</hi> within two yeeres at the moſt, and that hauing immured the King of <hi>France</hi> beyond the mountaines, hee might apply himſelfe to the affaires of <hi>Germany,</hi> without any impediment. His meaning was the Councell ſhould ſerue him for two things. Firſt to bridle the Pope, in caſe, during the warre of <hi>Italy,</hi> hee ſhould according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of other Popes, put himſelfe on the <hi>French</hi> ſide when that ſhould bee the weaker, to counterpoiſe him that was victorious. Secondly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Germany</hi> to his obedience, which was the marke he ſhot at. But for the Popes obedience, hee eſteemed it but an accidentall thing. For the place, <hi>Mantua</hi> pleaſed him; and for the reſt hee cared not what condition the Pope
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17208:49"/>
might adde, conſidering that when the Councell were aſſembled, he ſhould be able to change whatſoeuer pleaſed him not. Therefore he concluded that he was contented with any condition, ſo that the Councell might bee cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, alledging that he hoped to perſwade almoſt all <hi>Germanie</hi> to conſent vnto it. Wherefore the reſolution was eſtabliſhed by the Pope, and the whole colledge of Cardinals. <note place="margin">A reſolution eſtabliſhed for calling the Councell.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the Emperour, entering into the publike Conſiſtorie the 28. of April, thanked the Pope and Colledge, for hauing readily and without delay reſolued to call a generall Councell, and then deſired them that the Bull <note place="margin">The Emperor entereth into the publike Conſiſtorie.</note> might be diſpatched before hee parted from Rome, that himſelfe might giue order for the reſt. The Bull could not be framed ſo ſoone, becauſe it was neceſſarie to conſider of fit words to be put into it, ſuch as might giue as much hope of libertie as was poſſible, and yet not preiudice the Papall power. Sixe Cardinals, and three Biſhops were deputed for this buſineſſe; <note place="margin">The Bull for Conuocation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell is made.</note> and finally the Bull was finiſhed the twelfth of Iune, publiſhed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, and ſubſcribed by all the Cardinals. The tenor was as followeth.</p>
            <p>That from the beginning of his Papacie hee had deſired nothing more then to cleanſe the Church, recommended by God to his care, from hereſies and errors, and to reſtore the diſcipline to its former ſtate: for which finding no way more commodious then that which alwayes hath bene vſed in like occurrences, that is, a generall Councell, he had often written concerning it to the Emperour and other Kings, with hope not onely to obtaine this end, but alſo, that all diſcords being appeaſed betweene Princes of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome warre might bee made againſt the Infidels, to free the Chriſtians from that miſerable ſlauerie; and alſo to reduce the Infidels themſelues to the faith. Therefore by the fulneſſe of authoritie which he hath from God, by the conſent of his brethren the Cardinals, hee doth intimate a generall Councell of all Chriſtendome, againſt the 27. of May the next yeare 1537. <note place="margin">The Councell is to begin in <hi>Mantua,</hi> May 27. 1537.</note> in Mantua a rich place, and commodious for the celebration of the Councel. Therefore he commandeth the Biſhops and other Prelats, of what place ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, by vertue of their oath, and vnder the paines ſet downe by the holy canons and decrees, that they tender their preſence there at the day prefixed. He prayeth the Emperour, <hi>French</hi> King, and all other Kings and Princes to be there in perſon, or in caſe they cannot, to ſend honourable and ample ambaſſages, as the Emperour, <hi>French</hi> King, and other Chriſtian Princes haue often promiſed both to <hi>Clement,</hi> and to him: and to cauſe the prelats of their Kingdomes to goe thither, and there remaine vntill the end, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that which ſhall be fit to reforme the Church, extirpate hereſies, and to make warre againſt the Infidels.</p>
            <p>The Pope publiſhed another Bull alſo, to correct (as he ſayd) all the vices <note place="margin">A Bull for the reformation of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> and defects of the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> the head of all Chriſtendome, miſtris of learning, manners and diſcipline; that his owne houſe being firſt purged, he might more eaſily cleanſe the reſt. But not being able fully to performe this buſineſſe by himſelfe, he deputed the Cardinals <hi>Oſtienſe,</hi> Saint <hi>Seuerino, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutio,</hi> and <hi>Simoneta,</hi> commanding all men vnder the moſt grieuous paines, to yeeld them abſolute obedience. Theſe Cardinals, together with other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, deputed alſo by the Pope, applyed themſelues immediatly to reforme the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17208:50"/>
penitentiarie and Datarie Courts, and the manners of the Courtiers: yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">1537 PAVL. 3. CHARLES 5.—HENRY 8. FRANCIS 1.</note> tooke effect. But the intimation of the Councell ſeemed very vnfit to euery man of any meane capacitie, in a time when warres were on foote in <hi>Picardie, Prouence,</hi> and <hi>Piemont,</hi> betweene the Emperour and the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants when they had ſeene the bull, wrote to the Emperour, <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants doe not approoue the Bull of the Conuocation.</note> that it appeared not what ſhould be the forme and maner of the Councell. They deſired it ſhould be pious, free, and in <hi>Germanie,</hi> and ſuch a one was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer promiſed vnto them, and ſaid they hoped that his Maieſtie would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that their demaunds ſhould bee ſatisfied, and his promiſe fulfilled.</p>
            <p>But in the beginning of the next yeere 1537. the Emperor ſent to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants <hi>Matthias Eldo</hi> his Vice-Chancellor, to exhort them to receiue the <note place="margin">1537 The Emperor exhorteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to accept the Councell.</note> Councel, for the calling whereof he had taken ſo great paines, and where he meaned to affoord his perſonall preſence, if ſome great warre conſtrained him not to be elſewhere. He put them in mind that they had appealed to a Councell, and therefore that it was not conuenient that now they ſhould change their purpoſe, and refuſe to meete all other Nations, who haue fixed therein all their hope for reformation of the Church. Concerning the Pope, the Emperor ſayd there was no doubt but that hee would gouerne himſelfe as was fit for the principall head of the Church, and that in caſethey had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complaint againſt him, they might modeſtly proſecute it in the Councel. For the manner and forme, that it was not conuenient they ſhould preſcribe it to all Nations, but ſhould rather thinke that not their diuines onely were inſpired from God, and vnderſtood holy myſteries, but that men may elſewhere be found, who want neither learning, nor ſanctitie of life. For the place, though they haue demanded it in <hi>Germanie,</hi> yet the ſhould conſider what was fit for other Nations. <hi>Mantua</hi> is neere to <hi>Germany,</hi> rich, health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the Duke thereof vaſſall of the Empire; ſo that the Pope hath no power there; and if they deſired any further caution, himfelfe was ready to giue it them. Hee ſpake alſo apart with the Elector of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> exhorting him to ſend his Ambaſſadours to the Councell, without vſing exceptions or excuſes, which would hatch nothing but inconueniences. Concerning the <note place="margin">And they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> Councell, the Proteſtants anſwered, that hauing read the Popes letters, they ſaw well, that hee and the Emperour were not of one mind; and, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated what was treated of with <hi>Adrian, Clement,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> they concluded that they had all the ſame end. They went on to alledge their reaſons, why the Pope ſhould not be iudge in the Councell, nor yet thoſe, who were by oath tyed vnto him. And for the place appointed, beſide that it was againſt the Decrees of the Imperiall Diets, no ſafe conduct could free them from danger, if they went thither. For the Pope hauing adherents throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> who bitterly hate the Proteſtants doctrine, there was great danger of treachery and ſecret plots. Beſides, in regard that many Doctors and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ought to goe in perſon, becauſe it is not fit to handle a matter of that importance by deputies, their Churches would be left deſolate. And how can they conſent to the iudgement of the Pope, who hath no other ayme but to roote out their doctrine, which hee calleth hereſie, and cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from ſaying ſo much in all his Buls, yea, in that, by which hee inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17208:50"/>
the Councell: and in the Bull, which, diſſemblingly, hee made for reformation of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> hee hath often repeated, that hee hath called a Councell to extirpate the Lutheran hereſie, and maketh demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof by effects, exerciſing bloudie torments and puniſhments, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt poore innocent people, who adhere to that religion, for conſcience ſake. And how ſhall they be able to accuſe the Pope and his followers, when himſelfe will be iudge? And to appoue his Briefe, is nothing elſe but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to their owne condemnation. And therefore that they haue alwayes demanded a free and Chriſtian Councel, not onely that euery man may free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake, the Turkes and infidels being excluded; but that thoſe that are linked together by oathes, and other Couenants, may not bee Iudges, and that the word of God may gouerne, and define all the controuerſies. That they well know, that there are learned and godly men in other Nations: but withall they aſſure themſelues, that if the vnlimited power of the Pope ſhall be moderated, not their Diuines onely, but many others, who now by reaſon of oppreſſion hide themſelues, will labour for reformation of the Church. That they will not diſpute of the ſituation and fitneſſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> but they may well ſay, that ſo long as there is warre in <hi>Italie,</hi> they cannot want matter of ſuſpition. That it is ſufficient to ſay of the Duke of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that he hath a brother a Cardinall, one of the prime men of the Court. That in <hi>Germany,</hi> there are many Cities as commodious as <hi>Mantua,</hi> where Iuſtice and equitie doe flouriſh: and in <hi>Germanie</hi> thoſe ſecret wiles to take away mens liues, are neither vſed nor knowne, as they are in other places. That in the ancient Councels, the ſecureneſſe of the place hath euer been firſt ſought for, which would not be ſufficient there, though hee the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour were perſonally preſent in the Councell. For it is knowne that the Popes grant him place in conſultations, but for power of determining, they reſerue it to themſelues onely. That it was knowne what happened to the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> whoſe ſafe-conduct was violated by the Synod: and himſelfe conſtrained to put vp ſo great an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front. Therefore they prayed his Maieſtie to conſider the importance of theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>There appeared in this ſame Diet the Biſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> ſent by the Pope to inuite them to the Councell. But hee did no good, and ſome of the Princes <note place="margin">Some of the Proteſtant Princes would not ſo much as heare thé Popes Nuncio</note> would not ſo much as heare him. And to make their reaſons knowne to the world they printed and publiſhed a writing, where they laboured prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to anſwere that obiection, that they would not ſubmit themſelues to any Iudge, that they deſpiſed other nations, that they refuſed the ſupreame <note place="margin">They iuſtifie their actions to the world by writing.</note> tribunall of the Church, that they had renewed hereſies formerly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they were glad of ciuill diſcords, that the faults which they found in the manners of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſmall, and tolerable. They al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged the cauſes why it was not fit, that the Pope alone, nor yet together with his adherents ſhould be iudge: they brought the examples of many Councels refuſed by diuers of the Fathers, and in fine, implored the ayde of all Princes, offering that whenſoeuer a lawfull Councell ſhall bee called, they will therein defend their cauſe, and render an account of all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They ſent alſo an expreſſe Ambaſſadour to the French King, to giue
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17208:51"/>
him a particular account of the ſame things: who anſwered, that for the Councell he was of their opinion, not to approoue it, except it were lawfull, and in a ſecure place, aſſuring them that his ſonne in-law, the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> was of the ſame mind.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to gratifie the Pope, granted his Citie for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, without conſidering what he did, thinking as others, that it could not <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a grant of his Citie and afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calleth it.</note> be effected, there being warres betweene the Emperour and French King, and <hi>Germany</hi> oppoſing it, for whoſe ſake it was called, But when hee ſaw the intimation, he began to thinke how to ſecure the place, and ſent a propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Pope, that, in regard of the great number of thoſe that would come to the Councel, there was need of a great garriſon, which he would not haue depend vpon any but himſelfe; and that hee was not able to maintaine it. Therefore in caſe his Holineſſe would celebrate the Councell in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; he muſt allow him money for ſoldiers pay. The Pope anſwered that the multitude would not conſiſt of men of armes, nor profeſſed for the war, but of Eccleſiaſticall and learned perſons, which one magiſtrate, whom hee would depute to render iuſtice, with a ſmall court and gard, was able to keepe in order; that a garriſon of ſouldiers would breed a generall ſuſpicion, and became not the place of the Councell, where all ſhould appeare and bee truely peaceable; and that in caſe a garriſon were neceſſary, it were not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to put it into the hands of any but of the Councel it ſelf, that is, of the Pope, who is head thereof. The Duke, conſidering that iuriſdiction draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">The Pope claymeth right to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice where the Councell ſhall be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated.</note> with it abſolute ſoueraigntie, replyed, that by no meanes hee would haue iuſtice adminiſtred in his Citie, but by his owne officers. The Pope, a very wiſeman, who ſeldome receiued any anſwere which hee did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, was much amazed, and anſwered the Dukes man, that hee would neuer haue beleeued that by his Lord, a Prince of <hi>Italy,</hi> whoſe family hath beene ſo much aduanced by the Apoſtolicall Sea, who had a brother a Cardinall, that would bee denied him of which neuer any made doubt before, which the Law of God and man doth giue him, which the very <hi>Lutherans</hi> cannot denie, that is, to be ſupreame iudge of the Clergie; a thing which the Duke denieth not to his owne Biſhops, to iudge the cauſes of Prieſts in <hi>Mantua.</hi> That in the Councel none ſhould be preſent but the Eccleſiaſtiques, who are exempted from the ſecular power, both themſelues and their families. Which <note place="margin">Prieſts concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines are of Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction.</note> is ſo cleere, that the Doctors of Diuinitie affirme that the very concubines of Prieſts are of Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction; and yet he would denie him a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to render iuſtice to thoſe men, during the time of the Councell. The Duke, for all this, was conſtant, aſwell in refuſing the Popes Magiſtrates, as alſo in demaunding pay for ſouldiers. Theſe conditions ſeeming hard to the Pope, contrary (as he ſayd) to the auncient cuſtome, and againſt the dignity <note place="margin">The Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth not to call the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel at <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </note> of the Sea and Eccleſiaſticall libertie he would not yeeld vnto them, and reſolued not to call the Councell at <hi>Mantua.</hi> He remembred very well what happened to <hi>Iohn</hi> 23. for calling a Councell where another was ſtronger then hee. His purpoſe therefore was to prolong the time, and excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in a publique Bull, ſaying in ſubſtance, that though with griefe hee was conſtrained to depute an other place for the Synod, yet hee endured it with patience, becauſe another was in fault and not himſelfe: and becauſe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17208:51"/>
hee could not reſolue ſo ſuddenly vpon a conuenient Citie, hee deſerred the celebration thereof vntill the firſt of Nouember the ſame yeere.</p>
            <p>At that time the King of <hi>England</hi> publiſhed a manifeſt in his owne name, and of his nobilitie, againſt the Popes Conuocation, as by a perſon that had no power, in a time when <hi>Italie</hi> was ſet a fire with warre, and in a place not ſecure, adding that hee much deſired a Chriſtian Councell, but that to <note place="margin">The King of <hi>England</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Councel by a publique ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.</note> the Popes he would neither goe nor ſend Ambaſſadours, hauing nothing to doe with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or his Edicts, more then with the edicts of any other Biſhop. That the auncient Councels were called by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Kings, which cuſtome ought now the rather to be renewed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the defect of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> are called into queſtion. That it was not vſuall with Popes to breake their faith, which himſelfe had more cauſe to conſider then others, beeing moſt bitterly hated by him, for hauing denyed him authoritie in his Kingdome, and the reuenew which was payd him. That to blame the Prince of <hi>Mantua,</hi> becauſe hee will not receiue ſo many people into his Citie without a garriſon, is to mocke the world; as alſo to prorogue the Councel vnto Nouember; not ſaying in what place it ſhall be celebrated. And if the Pope chooſe the place, without doubt it will be in his owne State, or of ſome Prince that is obliged to him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it being impoſſible that any man of iudgement ſhould hope for a true Councel, the beſt way was for euery Prince to reforme Religion at home: concluding in the end that if any man could giue him better directions, hee would not refuſe to follow them. <note place="margin">The care of reforming the Court, was committed to 4. Cardinals, but nothing was done, which made the <hi>Italians</hi> ſuſpect the Popes actions.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Italy</hi> alſo there was a generall diſpoſition to interpret the Popes acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the worſer ſenſe: and it was ſpoken freely, that though the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> were blamed, yet he was not the cauſe why the Councell was not called, whereof there was a manifeſt argument, becauſe the Pope had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Bull for reformation of the Court, and committed the care thereof to foure Cardinals at the ſame time; which notwithſtanding was buried in ſilence, though neither the Duke, nor any bodie elſe hindered it from beeing in his power: and hauing propoſed it immediately after it was aſſumed to the Papacie, it was not ſo much as ſpoken of for three yeeres after. The <note place="margin">The reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſet on foot againe.</note> Pope to withſtand theſe defamations, reſolued to ſet the buſineſſe on foote againe, firſt reforming himſelfe, the Cardinals, and the Court, that none might obiect againſt him, nor make bad conſtruction of his actions; and he elected foure Cardinals, and fiue other Prelates, whom he ſo much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that the yeere following hee made foure of them Cardinals, giuing charge to thoſe nine to collect the abuſes, which deſerued amendment, and withall to adde the remedies, by which they might quickly, and eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued, and to reduce all to a good reformation. The Prelates made the collection, as the Pope commanded, and committed it to writing. <note place="margin">The fountain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In the beginning they propoſed for the fountaine and ſource of all the abuſes, the Popes readineſſe in giuing eare to flatterers, and his facility in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing with Lawes, with neglect of the Commandement of Chriſt, not to receiue gaine for ſpirituall things. And deſcending to particulars, they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted twenty foure abuſes in the adminiſtration of Eccleſiaſticall matters, and foure in the ſpeciall gouernment of <hi>Rome:</hi> they touched the ordination of <note place="margin">The particular abuſes.</note>

And, Paſſing to diſpenſations, firſt they touched that, for mariage of thoſe that are in orders, for marriages in degrees forbidden, diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons granted to Symoniacall perſons, facilitie of graunting Confeſſionals and Indulgences, diſpenſation of vowes, licence to bequeath by will the Church-goods, commutation of wils and teſtaments, toleration of harlots, negligence of the gouernement of hoſpitals, and ſuch other things, which they exactly handled, expounding the nature of the abuſes, the cauſes and originall of them, the conſequences of the euils which they carry with them, the meanes to redreſſe them, and to keepe hence forward the body of <note place="margin">Theſe things are ſet downe at large in the 12.

            <p>The Pope hauing receiued the relation of theſe Prelats, cauſed many Cardinals to conſider of it, and after, that he might reſolue what to doe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it in the Conſiſtory. Fryar <hi>Nicholas Scomberg,</hi> a Dominican Cardinall of S. <hi>Siſtus, alias</hi> of <hi>Capua,</hi> ſhewed in a long diſcourſe, that that time compor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">The Cudinall of S. <hi>Siſtus</hi> would haue no reformat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at al made.</note> not any reformation at all. Firſt, hee put them in mind of the malice of man, which being ſtopped in one courſe, findeth a worſe, and that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to tolerate a knowen euill, which, becauſe it is in vſe, is not ſo much mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyled at, then by redreſſing that, to fall into another, which, being new, will appeare greater, and be more reprehended. Hee added that it would giue occaſion to the Lutherans, to bragge that they had inforced the Pope to make that reformation; and aboue all he conſidered that it would bee a beginning to take away not onely the abuſes, but the good vſes alſo, and to endanger the whole ſtate of religion. For by the reformation it would be confeſſed that the things prouided againſt were deſeruedly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the Lutherans, which would be a great abetting to their whole <note place="margin">Cardinall <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raffa</hi> deſireth the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> doctrine. On the other ſide, <hi>Iohn Peter Caraffa,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Theatino,</hi> ſhewed that the reformation was neceſſarie, and that it was a great offence to God to leaue it, and anſwered that it was a rule in Chriſtian actions, that as euill is not to be done that good may follow, ſo no good of obligation is to be omitted, for feare that euill may enſue. The opinions deliuered were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, <note place="margin">The Pope co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the remonſtrance of the Prelats to be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but a copie of it is ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Germany</hi> by Cardinall <hi>Scomberg,</hi> The King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth a Proteſtant.</note> and the finall concluſion was not to ſpeake any more of it vntill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; and the Pope commanded that the remonſtrance of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats ſhould be concealed. But Cardinall <hi>Scomberg</hi> ſent a copie thereof into <hi>Germanie,</hi> which ſome thought was done by the Popes conſent, that it might appeare there was ſome deſigne in <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome paines taken alſo for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. The coppy was ſuddenly printed, and publiſhed, throughout all <hi>Germany,</hi> and many wrote againſt it, both in Dutch and Latine. And the number of the Proteſtants increaſed dayly in that Countrey, the king of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke,</hi> and ſome princes of the houſe of <hi>Brandeburg</hi> being entred into their league.</p>
            <p>Nouember drawing neere, the Pope ſent out a Bull for conuocation of <note place="margin">The Councell is intimated at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and three Legates appointed.</note> the Councell at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and alledging the neceſſitie to prorogue the time,

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> de a colourable ſhew that he would celebrate.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icenza,</hi> more then hee would haue done to <hi>Mantua,</hi> though no man deſired a publike aſſembly of Chriſtians more then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſo that the Councell bee generall, free, and picus, ſuch as hee hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in his proteſtation againſt the Councell of <hi>Mantua.</hi> And as nothing is more holy then a generall Conuocation of Chriſtians, ſo nothing is more preiudiciall and pernicious to religion, then a Councell abuſed for gaine and profit, or confirmation of errours. That it is called a generall Councell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Chriſtians may ſpeake their opinions; and that it cannot bee called generall, where onely they are heard, who are reſolued to put themſelues on the Popes ſide, in all matters, and where the ſame men are plaintifes, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, aduocates, and iudges. That all may bee ſayd of <hi>Viconza</hi> which, in his declaration, hath been ſaid of <hi>Mantua.</hi> And briefly repeating a ſhort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thereof, hee ſayd, if <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> hath not yeelded ſo much to the Popes authoritie, as to grant him his Citie in that manner that he would; why ſhould we ſo much eſteeme it, as to goe whither hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth? If the Pope hath power from God to call Princes whither hee will, why can hee not chooſe what place hee liſteth, and make himſelfe obeyed? If the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> can, with reaſon, denie the place which the Pope hath choſen, why cannot other Kings and Princes refuſe to goe thither? And if all Princes ſhould denie him their Cities, where would be his power? what a thing would it haue beene, if all men had put themſelues into the iourney, and being arriued there, ſhould haue beene ſhut out of doores by the Duke of <hi>Mantua?</hi> That which happened for <hi>Mantua,</hi> may happen likewiſe for <hi>Vicenza.</hi>

               </note> two great Princes, though his principall ende was to draw the Dukedome of <hi>Milan</hi> into his houſe. I here the Pope, amongſt other things, deſired them both to ſend their Ambaſſadours to the Councell, and to cauſe the Prelates which were in their traines to goe alſo, and to giue order that thoſe that were at home in their Kingdomes ſhould begin their voyage thither. For
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17208:53"/>
gluing the order they both excuſed, and ſaid, that firſt it was fit to informe themſelues by the Prelates, of the neceſſities of their Churches; and for ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thoſe that wore preſent, that it would bee hard to perſwade them to goe before they had conſolted with others. The Pope was ſo eaſily ſatisfied with the anſwere, that it was doubted, whether hee more deſired the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue, or the negatiue. Therefore this Treatie being vnprofitable, as were all his other in that meeting, hee went his way, and, being at <hi>Genua,</hi> in <note place="margin">The Councel is defened vnull Eaſter.</note> his returne, receiued letters from his Legates, who were at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icenza,</hi> yet alone without any Prelate; wherefore hee recalled them, and by his Bull, dated the eight of Iulie, prolonged the terme of the Councell vntil the next Eaſter day.</p>
            <p>This yeere, the Pope brake the wiſe patience, or rather diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, for foure yeeres together, hee had vſed towards <hi>England,</hi> and ſent againſt the King a terrible thundering Bull, ſuch as neuer was <note place="margin">The Pope thundereth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the K. of <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> vſed by his predeceſſours, nor imitated by his ſucceſſours. Which ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, hauing its originall from the Manifeſts, publiſhed againſt the Councel of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>

Beſides, for the vnderſtanding of many accidents which ſhall bee related heereafter, it is neceſſary to repeate this euent, with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of it.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> hauing denied his obedience to <hi>Rome,</hi> and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe head of the Engliſh Church, the yeere 1534. as hath beene ſaid in its place, Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> immediately after his aſſumption, was continually inſtigated by the Emperour for his owne intereſts, and by the Court, which thought by that meanes, either to regaine <hi>England,</hi> or ſet it on fire, to fulmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate againſt that King: which hee, as a man well experienced in the world, iudged would bee to little purpoſe; conſidering, that if the thunders of his predeceſſors neuer had good ſucceſſe, when they were beleeued and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all, there was leſſe hope they could effect any thing, after a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was publiſhed, and receiued by many, which did contemne them. Hee thought it wiſedome to hold a weapon within the ſcabberd, which had no other edge, but what was giuen by the opinion of thoſe againſt whom it was vſed. But the beheading of the Cardinall of <hi>Rocheſter</hi> happening in the yeere 1535, the other Cardinals were earneſt in remonſtrating vnto him what a ſhame, and how great a danger it was to the Order, which euer was eſteemed moſt ſacred and inuiolable, if ſuch an example ſhould bee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to paſſe. For the Cardinals defend the Popedome boldly with all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, becauſe they are aſſured of their liues: which aſſurance, when it ſhall be taken away, and made knowen to the Seculars, that the Cardinals may bee iuſticed, they ſhould doe their buſineſſe with too much feare: Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the Pope forſooke not his reſolution, but found a temper, neuer vſed by any of his predeceſſors, to lift vp the thunderbolt with his hand and to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to ſhoote, yet to hold it without flinging it abroad, and ſo to ſatisfie the Cardinals, the Court, and others, and not to put the Papal authoritie in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard. Therefore he framed a Proceſſe and moſt ſeuere ſentence againſt that King the thirtieth of Auguſt 1535. and withall ſuſpended the publication, during his pleaſure. Yet ſecretly he let the copie goe into the hands of ſome
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17208:53"/>
that hee knew would cauſe it to bee deliuered to the King, diſperſing the rumor of the Bull that was framed, and the ſuſpenſion, with fame, that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuddenly hee would remooue the ſuſpenſion, and come to publication, yet with deſeigne neuer to proceede ſo farre.</p>
            <p>And though hee wanted not hope, that the King either for feare of the excommunication framed, or by the inclination of his people, or by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tietie of puniſhments, vſed againſt thoſe that diſobeyed his Decree, would induce himſelfe, or by the mediation of the Emperour, or French King, (when by reaſon of the occurrences of the world, hee ſhould bee conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to vnite himſelfe with either of them) would bee induced to yeeld, yet he was principally mooued by the forenamed cauſe, that he might not ſhew the weakeneſſe of his weapons, and more confirme the King in his ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But in the end of three yeeres hee changed his purpoſe, by reaſon of the prouocation which the King ſeemed to vſe againſt him, by ſending out manifeſts againſt all his callings of the Councell, and by oppoſing his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though without particular offence of his perſon, and laſtly, by hauing proſecuted, cited, &amp; condemned S. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for a traitour to the <note place="margin">The King of <hi>England</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneeth S. <hi>Thomas Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope was offended, as well becauſe there ſhould be a treatie about Religion in <hi>Germanie,</hi> as becauſe it derogated from the credit of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell intimated, though hee cared very little to haue it celebrated, and more particularly becauſe there was a diſpute to admit of one to bee ſent by him, and in the end his authoritie wholly reiected. Therefore hee ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched into <hi>Spaine</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Monte Pulciano,</hi> whoſe principall meſſage was to perſwade the Emperour not to confirme, yea, rather to annihilate the Decrees of that Diet.</p>
            <p>The Nuncio had a great and long inſtruction, firſt, to complaine grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly <note place="margin">He ſendeth a Nuncio to the Emperor.</note> of the demeanor of <hi>Iohn <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſſalius,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>London,</hi> his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, who forgetting his oath made to that Sea, and infinite Benefits receiued from the Pope, and the inſtruction giuen him by the Emperour, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the demands of the Lutherans, with preiudice of the Apoſtolique Sea, and diſhonour of his imperiall Maieſtie. That <hi>London</hi> was corrupted with gifts and promiſes, the Citie of <hi>Ausburg</hi> hauing giuen him 250. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Florins of gold, and the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> promiſed him 4. thouſand Florins yeerely, out of the fruits of his Archbiſhoprique of <hi>London,</hi> which was taken from him. That he thought to take a wife, and forſake the Church, <note place="margin">A Citie in <hi>Denmarke.</hi>
               </note> and had neuer entred into holy orders. The Nuncio had commandement to ſhew to the Emperour, that if the things which <hi>London</hi> had graunted, were confirmed by him, they would ſhew that hee was not a ſonne of the Apoſtolique Sea; and that all the Catholique Princes of <hi>Germanie</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereof, and were of opinion that his Maieſtie would not confirme them. Hee gaue order alſo to propoſe vnto him his intereſts concerning the Dutchie of <hi>Ghelderland,</hi> and the election of the King of the Romans, to moue him the more; putting him alſo in minde that hee could not haue <hi>Germanie</hi> at his diſpoſition, by tolerating the Lutheran hereſies, as <hi>London</hi> and others did perſwade. For it is a thing long ſince knowen, that principalities can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in likelihood be preſerued where Religion is loſt, or where two religions are ſuffered. That this happened to the Emperors of the Eaſt, who hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned the obedience due to the vniuerſall Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> loſt their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; Kingdoms. That the cunning of the Lutherans was manifeſt, who haue proceeded maliciouſly with his Maieſtie, and that, vnder the colour of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing their Religion they doe euer procure ſomething elſe. That an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thereof was the Diet of <hi>Spira</hi> in the yeere 1526, of <hi>Noremberg</hi> 1532, and of <hi>Calano</hi> 1534. when the Duke of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> regained the Dutchie, which ſhewed that thoſe commotions of the Landgraue and the Lutherans were not for religion, but to take that ſtate from the King of the <hi>Romanes.</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:17208:54"/>
That hee ſhould put him in minde that, when hee made an accord with the Lutherans, the Catholique Princes would not endure ſuch a diſorder, that his Maieſtie ſhould haue more power ouer them then ouer the Proteſtants, and would thinke vpon new remedies. That there are many other lawfull and honeſt wayes to reduce <hi>Germanie,</hi> the Pope being reſolued to afford him all poſſible ayde, according to the proportion of his forces. And when his Maieſtie ſhall haue well thought thereon, he will finde that theſe capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cannot bee approoued, without making all <hi>Germany</hi> Lutheran; which were wholly to depriue himſelfe of authority. For that Sect excludeth all ſuperiority, extolling liberty, or rather licence aboue all. That he ſhould put into the Emperours head to augment the Catholique League, and to take from the Lutherans their adherents, as much as hee could, and to ſend as much money as was poſſible into <hi>Germanie,</hi> to promiſe, and really to giue it to thoſe that follow the Catholique league. That it were good alſo, vnder colour of Turkiſh affaires, to ſend a competent number of Spaniards or Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians into thoſe parts, lodging them within the territories of the King of the Romans. That the Pope was reſolued to ſend ſome perſon to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Princes, with money, to gratifie thoſe that ſhall be fit for his purpoſe. That he ſhould exhort <hi>Caeſar,</hi> to make ſuch an Edict, as the King of <hi>England</hi> made in his Kingdome, cauſing a rumour to bee ſpread cunningly, that his Maieſtie negotiated with the ſayd King, to reduce him to the obedience of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope gaue commiſſion alſo to the ſayd <hi>Montepulciano</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine to the Emperour, that his ſiſter, Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> Gouerneſſe of the low Countries, ſecretly fauoured the Lutherane part, that ſhee purpoſely ſent <note place="margin">The Nuncio complaineth againſt the Emperors ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</note> men vnto them, that, when the Catholique league was to be eſtabliſhed, ſhee wrote to the Elector of <hi>Triers,</hi> that hee ſhould not enter into it, and ſo that good worke was croſſed; that ſhee hindered the Lord of <hi>Lauaur,</hi> the French Ambaſſadour, from going into <hi>Germanie,</hi> to conſult with the King of the Romanes, and the Legate of his Holineſſe about religion: which hee did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue proceeded notfrom her owne will, but from the counſell of her bad miniſters.</p>
            <p>But becauſe mention is made of the Edict of the King of <hi>England</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">The Edict of religion made by K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8.</note> of Religion, it will not bee amiſſe to recount heere, how <hi>Henry</hi> the eight in the time of the Diet of <hi>Francfort,</hi> either becauſe he thought to doe God ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice by not permitting innouation of religion within his Kingdome, or to ſhew conſtancie in what hee had wrote againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> or to giue the Pope the lie, who laid an imputation vpon him in his Bull, that hee had publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed hereticall doctrine in his Kingdome, made a publique Edict, whereby hee commanded that the reall preſence of the true and naturall body and blood of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, vnder the kindes of bread and wine, there remaining no ſubſtance of thoſe elements, was to bee beleeued throughout all <hi>England,</hi> as alſo that Chriſt was wholly contained vnder the one and the other kinde; that the communion of the Cup was not neceſſary; that it was not lawfull for Prieſts to marry; that religious men, after their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and vowes of chaſtity, were bound alwayes to keepe them, and to liue in Monaſteries; that ſecret and Auricular confeſſion was not onely profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but alſo neceſſary; that the celebration of Maſſe euen priuate, was an
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17208:55"/>
holy thing, which hee commanded ſhould bee obſerued in his Kingdome. He prohibited all to doe or teach any thing contrary to theſe articles, vpon paine to be puniſhed as heretiques. It is to bee marueiled at, how the Pope, who a little before thundered againſt that King, was conſtrained to prayſe his actions, and to propoſe him to the Emperour for an enſample to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated. So a mans proper intereſt makes him commend and blame the ſame perſon.</p>
            <p>But the Pope, after hee had diſpatched <hi>Montepulciano;</hi> ſeeing that by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Councell, and after deferring it, though hee entertayned the world, yet hee loſt reputation, thought it neceſſary to leaue that ambiguous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, which howſoeuer it had giuen men ſatisfaction heeretofore, yet in <note place="margin">A conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the Councel.</note> progreſſe of time it might produce ſome ſiniſter effect. And hee made a ſecret reſolution, to declare himſelfe, and to forſake ambiguities; and in the conſiſtory, hauing related what had happened, and propoſed that it was neceſſary to make a conſtant and firme reſolution, hee put the matter in conſultation. Some of the Cardinals, to deliuer themſelues from feare, which euery other day amazed them, did not approoue the ſuſpenſion, but deſired an expreſſe declaration that there ſhould bee no Councell at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it appeared not how the difficulties could bee ouercome, before there was a reconciliation betweene Princes, a neceſſary meanes, without which there was no hope it could bee celebrated. But the wiſer ſort were balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced betweene this and another feare, that there might bee Nationall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, or other remedies vſed, more offenſiue to them then a generall Synode; and therefore the maior part gaue conſent for the ſuſpenſion during pleaſure: thinking that when it ſhould ſeeme not fit to bring it to effect, it might bee continued, by pretending the diſcord betweene Princes, or ſome other thing; and that if there happened any danger of a Nationall Councell, or of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies, or ought elſe, it might bee remooued by promoting the Generall Councell, and aſſigning vnto it place and time; and afterwards it might bee called, or let alone, as time ſhould aduiſe. The match was made, and a Bull <note place="margin">The Councel intimated is ſuſpended du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pleaſure.</note> was framed the thirteenth of Iune, by which the Councell intimated was ſuſpended during pleaſure of the Pope and the Apoſtolicall Sea.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Montepulciano</hi> the Nuncio, who went into <hi>Spaine,</hi> executed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions with the Emperour; who, either for the cauſe alledged by the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, or for ſome reſpects of his owne, declared not himſelfe whether hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented or aſſented to the Colloquie, appointed to be held at <hi>Noremberg</hi> in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. Afterwards, by reaſon of his wiues death, and the rebellion of <hi>Gant,</hi> with part of the low Countries, hee had occaſion, by pretending affaires of greater importance, to leaue the matter in ſuſpence, and ſo the whole yeere 1539. paſſed.</p>
            <p>When I ſet my ſelfe to write this Story, conſidering the number of Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies, ſome onely intimated, and ſome held, to compoſe the differences in religion, I doubted whether it was fit to make mention of all, hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding reaſons for the one part and the other. In the end, conſidering that I haue propoſed to my ſelfe to relate all the cauſes of the Councell of Trent, and obſeruing that none hath beene intimated or held, but to hinder, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, or delay, or to haſten and accelerate the Councell, I reſolued to make

mention of euery one, eſpecially for the fruit which may be gathered from <note place="margin">1540 PAVL 3. CHARLES 5. HENRY 8. FRANCIS 1 1540</note> the knowledge of the notable particulars which happened in them: as in that which was appointed the yeere following, which had his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thus.</p>
            <p>The Emperour went to the low Countries by the way of <hi>France,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate thoſe ſeditions, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> mett him there where one of the moſt principall buſineſſes, conferred of betweene them both, was to finde a way of compoſition for matters of religion in <hi>Germanie,</hi> which being exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled by the body of the Emperours Councell, all did incline to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Colloquie herein.</p>
            <p>This comming to the eares of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> who was Legate there, and had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied <note place="margin">Cardinal <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> the Popes Legate diſſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie.</note> the Emperour in the voyage (which Cardinall, though a youth, vnder the age of twentie yeers, yet had in his company many perſons fit for buſineſſe, and amongſt others, <hi>Marcellus Ceruinus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicastro,</hi> who after was Pope, and called <hi>Marcellus</hi> the ſecond) hee oppoſed this reſolution, and treating with the Emperour, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and with al thoſe of the Councel he put them in mind, that the Proteſtants had beene often dealt withall, for peace, beginning ten yeeres ſince in the Diet of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> but ſtill without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: And in caſe any concluſion had beene made, it would haue beene vaine and fruitleſſe. For they dayly change their opinion, not following any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine doctrine, and haue oppoſed euen their owne <hi>Auguſtan</hi> confeſsion. That they are ſlipperie as Eeels. Firſt they were deſirous that the abuſes and vices ſhould be remooued; now they will not haue the Papacie amended but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, and the Apoſtolicall Sea, rooted out; and all Eccleſiaſticall iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction aboliſhed. And if euer they were petulant, they would be then much more, when the peace was not well confirmed with <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Turke</hi> threatned <hi>Hungarie.</hi> That there was no hope to perſwade them, becauſe the controuerſies were vpon innumerable doctrines. And becauſe there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sects among them, it is impoſſible to accord with all; beſides, that the greater part of them hath no other end, but to poſſeſſe the goods of others, and bereaue the Emperour of his authoritie. It was true that the inſtant Turkiſh warre perſwaded an agreement in Religion; but this was not to be done in particular or Nationall Diets; but in a generall Councell, which might immediately be intimated. For where Religion is in queſtion, no mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation can be made without common conſent. That <hi>Germany</hi> is not onely to bee reſpected, but <hi>France, Spaine, Italie,</hi> and other people, without whoſe counſell if <hi>Germany</hi> ſhall make a change, there will ariſe a dangerous diuiſion of that Prouince from the reſt. That it was a moſt ancient cuſtome; euen from the time of the Apoſtles, to compoſe controuerſies with a Councell onely, and that now all Kings, Princes, and godly men deſired it. That peace may now eaſily be concluded betweene the Emperor and the King of <hi>France,</hi> &amp; immediatly after a councel called, and in the meane ſpace indeauours may be vſed to increaſe the number and power of the Catholique league of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> which, by intimidating the Proteſtants, will cauſe them to ſubmit themſelues to the Councell, or at the leaſt they will bee enforced by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques; and when it ſhall be neceſſary to reſiſt the <hi>Turke,</hi> the Catholique league, being ſtrong, may conſtraine the Proteſtants to contribute: which in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17208:56"/>
caſe they will not doe, it was neceſſarie of two euils to chuſe the leſſer, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a greater fault to offend God by abandoning the cauſe of Religion, then to want the aſſiſtance of one part of a Prouince. And the rather, becauſe it is not eaſie to iudge who are more contrary to Chriſt, the Proteſtants or the <hi>Turkes.</hi> For theſe deſire to inthrale our bodies, but thoſe, both bodyes and ſoules together. All the diſcourſes and parlies of the Cardinal had for their concluſion, that it was fit to call a Councell, and to begin it that ſame yeere, and not to treate of Religion in the Diets of <hi>Germanie,</hi> but to labour or augment the Catholique league, and to make peace with the King of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour after much deliberation, concluded that he would labour for a concord, and gaue order for a Diet to be held in <hi>Germany,</hi> where <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> thought good, inuiting the Proteſtant Princes to be there in perſon, and promiſing publike ſecuritie vnto all. Cardinall <hi>Ferneſe,</hi> hearing of this <note place="margin">The Legate departeth.</note> concluſion, made without his knowledge, went immediately away, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by <hi>Paris,</hi> obtained of the King a ſeuere edict againſt the heretiques, and Lutherans, which being publiſhed, was executed in that citie, and after throughout all <hi>France</hi> with much rigour.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Germanie</hi> the Diet was called by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in <hi>Aganoa,</hi> where the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligue <note place="margin">The Diet of <hi>Aganoa</hi> about Religion.</note> Doctors, and many Proteſtant Preachers and Miniſters met together; and the Elector of <hi>Triers,</hi> the <hi>Palatine,</hi> Duke <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> and <hi>William,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Argentina,</hi> were deputed for mediators betweene the parties. The Proteſtants being required to preſent the heads of the doctrine in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, anſwered that they had giuen vp their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion in <hi>Ausburg,</hi> ten yeers ſince, and an Apologie in defence of it; that they perſeuered in that doctrine, and were ready to giue an account thereof vnto all men: and not knowing what the aduerſaries reprehended, they had no more to ſay, but expected to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand from them what it was they eſteemed contrary to trueth, for ſo the matter will come to a conference, and themſelues wil not faile to ſet peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eies. The Catholiques tooke them ſuddenly at their word, &amp; aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to what the others propoſed, inferred that it was fit to eſteem for appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued all things paſſed in that Diet, and to account the Decree firme and ſtable which was publiſhed in the Receſſe, and to lay before them the forme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation begun in that Diet. The Proteſtants, knowing their diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, in caſe they followed that forme, and the preiudice which that decree would haue inferred, vrged for a new forme, and to haue all the preiudices taken away. On the other ſide the Catholiques demaunded, that in regard all preiudice was to be remoued, thoſe things that the Proteſtants had done ſhould be rectified, and the Church goods, taken by them reſtored. The Proteſtants replyed, that the goods were not taken away, but, by renouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the true doctrine, were reapplyed to thoſe lawfull and honeſt vſes, vnto which they were deſtinated in their firſt inſtitution, from which the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie had degenerated, and therefore that it was neceſſarie to decide the points of the doctrine before they talked of the goods. And the contentions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded that a new forme, not preiudicial to any, ſhould be inſtituted, that the Doctors that treated on both ſides ſhould be equall in number, and that it ſhould be lawfull for the Pope to ſend his Nuncij thither, &amp; that the place of the Colloquie ſhould be changed, which ſhould begin in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17208:56"/>
               <hi>Wormes,</hi> the eight and twentieth of October next if the Emperour thought good. The Proteſtants accepted the Decree declaring that they refuſed not the preſence of the <hi>Nuncij,</hi> but intended not to attribute thereby any primacie to the Pope, nor authoritie to them.</p>
            <p>The Emperour confirmed the Decree, and gaue order for the aſſembly; and appointed <hi>Granuel</hi> for his Commiſſioner there: who going thither with his ſonne, the Biſhop of <hi>Arras,</hi> who after was Cardinall, and three Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <note place="margin">Colloquie in <hi>Wormes</hi> without effect.</note> Diuines, began the Colloquie, and made a very godly diſcourſe, and fit for pacification. A few dayes after, there arriued <hi>Thomas Campeggio,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Feltre,</hi> Nuncio to the Pope. For his Holineſſe, though he ſaw that euery <note place="margin">To which the Pope ſendeth a Nuncio.</note> treatie of religion in <hi>Germanie</hi> was pernicious to his affaires, and therefore had vſed all diligence to breake off that conference, yet hee thought it leſſe hurt to giue conſent vnto it, then ſuffer it to bee done againſt his will. The Nuncio, according to the Popes inſtruction, at his entrie, made a diſcourſe, that the quiet of <hi>Germany</hi> was alwayes procured by the Popes, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by <hi>Paulus</hi> 3. who for that cauſe, had intimated a generall Councell in <hi>Viconza,</hi> howſoeuer he was conſtrained to deferre it, vntill another time, becauſe man went thither, and now was reſolued to intimate it againe in a more conuenient place: in which, that the matter of religion might be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with fruit, hee had graunted to the Emperour, that a Colloquie might bee held in <hi>Germanie,</hi> which might bee an entrance; to diſpoſe them to the reſolution of the Councell, and had ſent him to bee preſent there, and to aſſiſt. Therefore hee prayed them all to aime at concord, promiſing that the Pope would doe whatſoeuer with pietie hee could. There arriued alſo <note place="margin">The Pope ſendeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nuncio vnder a falſe name.</note> the forenamed Biſhop of <hi>Capo d'Istria,</hi> who, though ſent by the Pope, as one who well vnderſtood the humors of <hi>Germany,</hi> yet came as ſent from <hi>France,</hi> that he might doe the Pope better ſeruice vnder another name. Hee cauſed an Oration to be printed, the ſubiect whereof was, the vnitie and peace in the Church, but the ſcope to ſhew that a Nationall Councell, was not the meanes to attaine thereunto. And this hee diſtributed amongſt as many men as hee could, to interrupt the Colloquie, which had a reſemblance of it. Much time was ſpent, in giuing forme to the conference, as well for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie, as for the number of the Doctors which were to ſpeake.

hauing ſpoken three dayes, the conference was interrupted. For <note place="margin">1541 PAVL. 3. CHARLES 5. HENRY 8. FRANCIS 1. 1541 The Diet of <hi>Ratisbon.</hi>
               </note> letters came from the Emperour, which recalled <hi>Granuel,</hi> and referred the reſt to the Diet in <hi>Ratisbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That began in March 1541. The Emperour was perſonally preſent, with great hope to end all diſcords, and to vnite <hi>Germany</hi> in one Religion. For which purpoſe hee alſo had deſired the Pope to ſend a Legate, a man learned and diſcreete, with moſt ample authoritie, that there might bee no neede to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> for any thing, but all might be there immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, which by the Diet and the Legate ſhould bee thought conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; ſaying, that for this end hee had yeelded to the great importunitie of the Nuncio reſiding with him, to breake off the Colloquie of <hi>Wormes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope ſent for his Legate <hi>Iaſper</hi> Cardinall <hi>Contarini,</hi> a man much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, <note place="margin">Iaſper Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini <hi>the Popes Legatin</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbon.</note> for his ſingular honeſty and learning, and put alſo into his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany men inſtructed in all the intereſts of the Court, with Notaries to make Inſtruments of whatſoeuer ſhould bee handled or ſpoken: hee gaue him Commiſſion, that if he foreſaw that they went about to doe any thing <note place="margin">His inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> which might tend to the diminution of the Papall authoritie, hee ſhould interrupt it, by propounding a generall Councell, the onely and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie; and in caſe the Emperour were forced to yeeld to the Proteſtants in any preiudiciall matter, he ought to forbid it, by the Poſtolique authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and, if it were done, to condemne it, and to declare it voyde, and, to leaue the Diet, but not the Emperours company.</p>
            <p>Being arriued at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> the firſt thing hee had to doe with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, <note place="margin">The firſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation with the Emperour.</note> was to excuſe the Pope, that hee had not giuen that ample autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and abſolute power which his Maieſtie deſired. Firſt, becauſe it is ſo annexed to the very bones of the Papacie, that it cannot be granted to any other; ſecondly, becauſe neither words nor clauſes are found; by which the authoritie of determining controuerſies of Faith can bee communicated by the Pope, the Priuiledge of not being able to erre being giuen to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon onely; in thoſe words, <hi>I haue prayed for thee, Peter:</hi> But that the Pope had giuen him all manner of power to agree with the Proteſtants, ſo that they deny not the Principles, which are, the Primacie of the Apoſtolique Sea, inſtituted by CHRIST, the Sacraments, as they are taught in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and what elſe is determined in the Bull of <hi>Leo,</hi> offering in other things to giue <hi>Germany</hi> ſatiſfaction. And hee deſired his Maieſtie not to giue eare to the propoſe of any thing not fit to be granted, without the priuitie of other Nations, to auoyd all dangerous diuiſion in Chriſtendome. It is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to make particular mention of the things that paſſed in that Diet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that was the principall cauſe, which induced the Pope not onely to conſent, as before, but to vſe all endeuours that the Councell might be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated; and which aſſured the Proteſtants, that neither in Councell, nor in any other place, where any Miniſter of the Pope was preſent, they could hope to obtaine any thing.</p>
            <p>The firſt action began the fifth of April; and it was deliuered in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours name, that his Maieſtie, ſeeing the Turke entred into the bowels of <hi>Germany</hi> (the cauſe whereof was the diuiſion of the States of the Empire for the difference in religion) had alwayes ſought a meanes of pacification;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17208:57"/>
and that of the Councel ſeeming vnto him moſt commodious, he went pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely into <hi>Italy</hi> to treat thereof with Pope <hi>Clement:</hi> and after, not being able to bring it to effect, he returned, and went in perſon to <hi>Rome,</hi> to make the ſame negotiation with Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> in whom he found much readineſſe. But not being able to effect any thing, by reaſon of diuers impediments of warre, hee had finally called that Diet, and beſought the Pope to ſend a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat thither. <note place="margin">The firſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Diet in <hi>Ratisbon.</hi>
               </note> Now he deſired nothing but that ſome compoſition might be made, and that ſome ſmall number of godly and learned men might bee choſen on either ſide, to conferre vpon the controuerſies, in friendly maner, without preiudice of either of the parties, and propoſe to the Diet the means of concord, that all being conſulted with the Legate, the wiſhed conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion might be attained. Suddenly there aroſe a controuerſie betweene the Catholiques and Proteſtants, about the manner of chooſing thoſe that ſhould treat. Wherefore the Emperour beeing deſirous that ſome good ſhould bee done, demanded, and obtayned of either partie, power to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the perſons, deſiring them to beleeue he would do nothing but for the common good. For the Catholiques he elected <hi>Iohn Ecchius, Iulius Flugius,</hi>

He made <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi> the Prince Palatine, and <hi>Granuel</hi> Preſidents of the Colloquie, adding vnto them ſome others, that all might paſſe with the greater dignity. When the aſſembly was made, <hi>Granuel</hi> publiſhed a booke, and ſaid it was giuen to <note place="margin">A booke gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Emperour as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The booke contained 22. Articles. The cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of man, the integrity of nature, free will, the cauſe of originall ſinne, Iuſtification, the Church, her ſignes, the ſignes of the word of God, penance after ſinne, the authoritie of the Church, the interpretation of the Scripture, the Sacraments, Order, Baptiſme, Confirmation, the Euchariſt, Penance, Matrimony, extreame Vnction, charitie, the Eccleſiaſticall Hierarchie, the articles determined by the Church, the vſe, adminiſtration, and ceremonies of the Sacraments, Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, and diſcipline of the people. It was read and examined, and ſome things were approoued, ſome things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by common conſent, and in others they could not agree. And theſe were, the ninth, of the power of the Church, the foureteenth, of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Penance, the eighteenth of the Hierarchie, the 19. of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles determined by the Church, the 21. of ſingle life. In theſe they differed, and either partie wrote his opinion.</p>
            <p>This being done in the aſſembly of all the Princes, the Emperour required the opinions of them all concerning the things agreed on, and the different opinions of the Collocutors, and withall propoſed the amendement of the ſtate of the Common-wealth, as well ciuill as Eccleſiaſticall. The Biſhops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected abſolutely the Booke of the concord, and whatſoeuer was done in the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17208:58"/>
Colloquie, vnto whom the other Electors and Catholike Princes, deſirous of peace, agreed not: and it was concluded, that the Emperour; as aduocate of the Church, together with the Apoſtolike Legat, ſhould examine the things agreed on, and if any thing were obſcure, ſhould cauſe it to bee expounded; and ſhould treat with the Proteſtants, that concerning the things in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, they ſhould conſent to ſome Chriſtian forme of concord. <hi>Caeſar</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted all to the Legat, and vrged him that the Eccleſiaſticall State ought to be reformed.

That hauing ſeene the Booke preſented to the Emperour, and what was written by the deputies of the Colloquie, as well the explications of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partie, as the exceptions of the Proteſtants, it ſeemed that the Proteſtants, differing in-certaine articles from the common conſent of the Church (in which not withſtanding he deſpaired not, that, with the helpe of God, they might be induced to agree) nothing ſhould be ordered concerning the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, but referred to the Pope, and the Apoſtolicall Sea, who, either in the generall Councell, or ſome other way, if there ſhall bee cauſe, will define them according to the Catholique trueth, with regard vnto the times, and what ſhall bee expedient for the Chriſtian Common-wealth, and for <hi>Germanie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for reformation of the Cleargie, hee promiſed all readineſſe, and, to <note place="margin">The exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Legat <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini</hi> made to the Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Firſt for their manner of liuing, that they ſhould abſtaine from all ſcandall, and appearance of luxurie, auarice, and ambition. For their familie, that they ſhould vnderſtand that from it the people made coniecture of the manners of the Biſhop, that, the better to keepe their flocke, they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the moſt inhabited places of the Dioceſſe, &amp; haue diligent watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men elſe-where, that they ſhould viſite the Dioceſſes, giue the Benefices to honeſt and fit men, ſpend their reuenues vpon the neceſſitie of the poore, flying not onely luxurie, but all ſuperfluous pompe, make prouiſion of godly, learned, diſcreet, and not contentious Preachers, procure that the yonger ſort be well brought vp, becauſe by this meanes the Proteſtants draw all the Nobilitie vnto them. Hee committed this Oration to writing, and gaue it to the Emperour, to the Biſhops, and the Princes: which gaue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Proteſtants to taxe the anſwere made to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> together with the exhortation made to the Prelats, alledging for their motiue, that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting being publiſhed, they ſhould ſeeme to approoue it, if they diſſembled the knowledge of it.

to bee) or, in caſe there were no Councell, vntill a Diet, where all the controuerſies of religion may bee exactly handled.</p>
            <p>The Electors approoued for good, and vndoubtedly profitable, that the Articles agreed on in the conference, ſhould by all be receiued, vntill the time of the Councell; in which they may bee examined againe, or, in caſe that faile, in a Nationall Councell, or Diet, becauſe it would ſerue to make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <note place="margin">The anſwere of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Electors.</note> reconciliation in the Articles, not accorded as yet. But yet they prayed his Maieſtie to goe on, if there were any hope to make any further agreement in that Diet: and if opportunity ſerued not, they thought it good, that, by his fauour, a generall or Nationall Councell, might bee called in <hi>Germanie,</hi> as ſoone as might bee, that the vnion might wholly be eſtabliſhed. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants <note place="margin">The anſwere of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</note> made the ſame anſwere, onely declaring themſelues, that as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a free and Chriſtian Councell in <hi>Germanie,</hi> ſo they could not conſent to any, where the Pope and his Miniſters, had power to heare and iudge the cauſes of religion. But the Biſhops and ſome few other Catholike Princes, <note place="margin">The anſwere of the BB. and of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Princes.</note> anſwered after another manner; firſt, confeſſing that in <hi>Germanie,</hi> and other Nations, there were many abuſes, ſectes, and hereſies, which could not bee extirpated without a generall Councell; adding, that they could not aſſent to any change in religion, ceremonies, and rites, ſeeing that the Popes Legate offereth a Councell within a ſhort time, and that his Maieſtie will treate with his Holineſſe thereof. But in caſe the generall Councell could not bee celebrated, they deſired that the Pope and Emperour would ordaine a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Councell in <hi>Germanie;</hi> which if they would not doe, another Diet ſhould bee aſſembled, to roote out the errours; and that they were reſolued to adhere to the old religion, as it is contained in the Scripture, Councels, doctrine of the Fathers, and alſo in the Imperiall <hi>Receſſes,</hi> eſpecially in that of <hi>Ausburg.</hi> That they will neuer conſent to receiue the Articles accorded in the Colloquie, becauſe ſome of them are ſuperfluous, as are the 4. firſt, and becauſe there are words in them, not conformable to the cuſtome of the Church; beſides ſome poſitions, which are partly damnable, and partly to be tempered; and becauſe the Articles accorded, are of leſſe moment, and thoſe of conſequence remaine in controuerſie: and becauſe the Catholikes of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie had granted too much to the Proteſtants, whereby the reputation of the Pope, &amp; the Catholike ſtates was wounded. They concluded it was better the acts of the Colloquie were left to their place, and whatſoeuer belonged to religion, deferred to a generall Councell, or Nationall, or a Diet. Not the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion only of the Catholikes, that the Emperors propoſition was too aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for the Proteſtants, cauſed them to make this anſwere, but alſo becauſe the three Catholike Doctors of the Colloquie diſſented amongſt themſelues.</p>
            <p>But the Legate vnderſtanding that the Emperour had named him, as conſenting to the eſtabliſhment of the things accorded, as well for feare, as at the inſtance of the Eccleſiaſtikes of the Diet, he went to the Emperour and complained, that his anſwere was ill interpreted, and that hee was bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">The Legate complaineth that his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere was miſtaken.</note> for hauing giuen conſent, that the things accorded, ſhould be tolerated vntill the Councell; that his minde was, that nothing ſhould be reſolued on, but all ſent to the Pope, who promiſed by the faith of a good Paſtour, and Vniuerſall Biſhop, that all ſhould bee determined by a generall Councell, or
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17208:59"/>
by ſome other way, equiualent, ſincerely, and without paſſion, not haſtily, but maturely, alwayes ayming at the formed of God. That his Holineſſe had to the ſame end, in the beginning of his Papacie, ſent letters and <hi>Nuncij</hi> to the Princes, to celebrate the Councell, and after did intimate it, and ſent his Legats to the place; and if hee had endured ſo many ireaties of religion in <hi>Germanie,</hi> with ſmall reuerence of his authoritie, to whom onely it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to make them, it was vpon his Maieſties purpoſe, and promiſe that all ſhould bee for the beſte, that it was vnreaſonable, that <hi>Germanie</hi> ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that to her ſelfe, with iniurie to the Apoſtolik Sea, which belongeth to all nations of Chriſtendome. Wherefore the Popes clemencie was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be abuſed, by concluding that in a Diet, which belongeth to him, and the Church vniuerſall, but ſayd, that the booke, and all the actes of the Colloquie, together with the opinions of both parties, was to bee ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the determination of his Holineſſe to bee expected. And not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this, hee publiſhed a third writing, in which hee ſayd, that his writing giuen to the Emperour, concerning the treatie of the Colloquie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diuerſly interpreted, ſome expounding it, as if hee had conſented to the Articles accorded of, vntill the generall Councell, and others vnderſtanding that hee had referred both theſe, and all other things to the Pope, to the end there may remaine no doubt heerein, he declareth that in the writing he had no intention to decide any thing in this buſineſſe, nor that any Article ſhould bee receiued or tolerated vntill the future Councell, and leaſt of all did then decide or define them, but had referred the whole treatie, and all the Articles thereof vnto the Pope, as hee did referre them ſtill. Which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing declared to the Emperour by word, hee would alſo declare and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it to the whole world in writing.</p>
            <p>And hee was not contented with this, but, conſidering that all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Princes, euen the Eccleſiaſtikes, did agree in demanding a Nationall Councel, and that, in his inſtruction, he had ſtraight charge from the Pope to oppoſe himſelfe when that ſhould bee vrged, though they would doe it with his authoritie, and with the preſence of the Apoſtolicall Legats to ſhew what danger it would be to mens ſoules, and iniurie to the Popes authoritie, from whom would be taken the power which God hath giuen him, and granted to one Nation; to put the Emperor in mind how himſelfe, being in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted a Nationall Councel, knowing it to be pernicious to the Imperiall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, becauſe the Subiects, incouraged by ſeeing power giuen them to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate in matter of religion, would thinke to doe the like in the temporall ſtate, and that his Maieſtie, after the yeere 1532. would neuer haue an Imperiall Diet celebrated in his preſence, leſt he ſhould giue occaſion of demanding a Nationall Councell: he treated moſt ſeriouſly with the Emperour, and with euery one of the Princes, and beſides publiſhed a writing addreſſed to the Catholikes.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17208:59"/>
thing were determined therein, it would bee voyde and of no force. And, as in not celebrating ſuch a Councell (as hee was perſwaded they would not) they ſhould doe a thing moſt acceptable to his Holineſſe, who is head of the Church, and of all Councels, ſo the celebration of it would bee moſt offenſiue to him. That it was a cleere caſe; that by this meanes greater <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions would ariſe in matter of Religion, as well in other Nations, as in that moſt noble Prouince. That hee would not omit this duetie, both to obey the inſtruction of his Holineſſe, and not to bee wanting to the charge of Legation layd vpon him.</p>
            <p>The Princes anſwered this writing of the Legate, that it was in his <note place="margin">The anſwere of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> power to remedie all the inconueniences which might ariſe, by perſwading his Holines; that a generall Councel might be intimated and celebrated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more procraſtination. That by this meanes all occaſion of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Councell (which all the States of the Empire deſired and prayed for) would bee remooued. But if the generall Councell, ſo often promiſed, and laſt of all by himſelfe, were not brought to effect, the manifeſt neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Germanie</hi> required, that the controuerſies ſhould bee determined in a nationall Synod, or in an imperiall Diet, with the aſſiſtance of the Popes Legate. The Proteſtant Diuines anſwered alſo in a long writing, and ſaid, <note place="margin">The anſwere of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Diuines.</note> that neither greater ſeditions, nor any at all could ariſe, when the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies of Religion ſhall bee compoſed according to the word of God, and manifeſt vices corrected according to the doctrine of the Scripture, and the vndoubted Canons of the Church. That to determine of faith hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer been formerly denied to Nationall Councels, becauſe CHRIST hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his aſſiſtance, where two or three ſhall bee aſſembled in his Name. That the number was great, not onely of Nationall Councels, but euen of a very few Biſhops, which haue determined the controuerſies, and ordered the manners of the Church in <hi>Syria, Greece, Affrique, Italie, France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> againſt the errours of <hi>Samoſatenus, Arrius,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts, Pelagius,</hi> and other heretiques; whoſe determinations cannot bee called voyde, of no force, and vaine, without impietie. That it hath beene granted to the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> to bee the firſt, and to the Pope to haue the chiefeſt authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Patriarkes; but that it is not found in any Father, that hee hath beene called head of the Church, or of the Councels. CHRIST onely is head; <hi>Paul, Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> are but Miniſters of the Church. That what may bee expected from <hi>Rome</hi> the diſcipline there obſerued ſo many ages, and the tergiuerſation to celebrate a lawfull Councel doe declare.</p>
            <p>But the Emperour, after long diſcuſſion, the 28 of Iuly made the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the Diet, remitting the whole action of the Colloquie vnto the generall Councell, or National Synod of <hi>Germanie,</hi> or a Diet of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.

            <p>After the Diet was ended, <hi>Caeſar</hi> paſſed into <hi>Italie,</hi> and diſcourſed with <note place="margin">A conference betweene the Pope and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in <hi>Lucca.</hi>
               </note> the Pope in <hi>Lucca,</hi> concerning the Councell, and the Turkiſh warre, and concluded that the Pope ſhould ſend a Nuncio into <hi>Germanie,</hi> to take reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution both in the one matter and the other, in the Diet which ſhould bee held in <hi>Spira</hi> in the beginning of the next yeere, and that the Councell ſhould bee held in <hi>

               </note> anſwered, that, the caſe being altered by reaſon of an accord which they lately had made with the Turke, they could not continue in the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe <hi>Soliman</hi> would ſuſpect that they mooued the Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to conſpire againſt him.

            <p>The yeere 1541. ended thus: and in the next the Pope ſent <hi>Iohn Morone,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Modena,</hi> to <hi>Spira,</hi> where the Diet was held in preſence of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand:</hi>

In fine, he referred it to his Holineſſe to conſider, if the actions of that King did ferue to remedie the miſchiefes of the Chriſtian Common-wealth, and to begin the Councell, which hee did euer croſſe, for his priuate gaine, and had conſtrained him, who did perceiue it, to finde a way to reconcile the differences of religion.

            <p>The King, preſaging what imputations would bee layd vpon him, for <note place="margin">The French King waxeth cruell againſt the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, to free himſelfe from the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons laid vpon him by the Emperour.</note> making a warre to the hurt of religion, and hinderance of the ſeruice of God, which might bee expected from the Councel, preuented it by publiſhing an Edict againſt the Lutheranes, commanding the Parliaments to execute it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolably, with ſeuere charge that all ſhould bee appeached, who had bookes differing from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that made ſecret conuenticles, that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the commandements of the Church, and eſpecially that obſerued not the doctrine of meates, or prayed in any tongue but the Latine; and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Sorboniſts to be diligent ſpies againſt them.

After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hauing full notice what <hi>Caeſar</hi> had written to the Pope, he wrote alſo <note place="margin">He writeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the Pope againſt the Emperour.</note> vnto him a long apologie for himſelfe, and an inuectiue againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, vpbraiding him with the ſurpriſe and ſacke of <hi>Rome,</hi> and with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion added to the loſſe, by making proceſſions in <hi>Spaine</hi> for the Popes deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery, whom himſelfe kept priſoner.

               </note> of <hi>Milan</hi> for his Nephewes; wherein hee was aſſiſted by <hi>Margarite,</hi> baſtard daughter to the Emperour, married to <hi>Octauius Farneſe,</hi> the Popes Nephew, and in that reſpect, made Dutcheſſe of <hi>Camerino.</hi> The Pope promiſed the Emperour to combine with him againſt the <hi>French</hi> King, to make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cardinals of his nomination, to pay him for ſome yeeres 150000. crownes, leauing alſo in his hands the Caſtles of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Cremona.</hi> But becauſe the Imperialiſts required a million of ducats for the preſent, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other million vpon ſhort dayes of payment, nothing could bee concluded: and in regard the Emperour could not longer tarrie, it was agreed to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the treatie, by meanes of the Popes Miniſters, who ſhould follow the Emperour. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhewed he was ſatiſfied with the Councell, that by the ſending of Legats, and aſſiſtance of thoſe few Prelats, the Catholiques of <hi>Germany</hi> at the leaſt had knowen his ready mind: and, becauſe the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might be imputed to the <hi>French</hi> King, he concluded that the remedie <note place="margin">He miſtruſtes the Emperour and turneth to the <hi>French</hi> King.</note> was not to be thought vpon, vntill it did appeare how the warre proceeded. They parted with great demonſtrations of mutuall ſatiſfaction; yet the Pope miſtruſted the Emperour, and from that time turned his mind toward the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>

But while he was thus doubtfull, the league betweene the Emperour and the King of <hi>England</hi> againſt <hi>France,</hi> was publiſhed, which conſtrained the Pope wholly to alienate himſelfe from him. For hee ſaw how much that league preiudiced his authoritie, being contracted with one excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, anathematized by him, curſed, deſtinated to eternall damnation, a ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique, depriued of his Kingdome and dominions, whoſe confederation <note place="margin">A league be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Emperour and King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note> made with whom ſoeuer was void, againſt whom alſo all Chriſtians, Princes were bound by his commandement to take armes, and, which moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſtill remaining more contumacious, and openly deſpiſing his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, <note place="margin">The Pope was much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the league.</note> this euidently ſhewed to the world that the Emperour bare no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto him, neither ſpirituall nor temporall, and gaue example to all, to make no account of his authoritie. And the affront ſeemed to him the greater, becauſe <hi>Clement,</hi> who might eaſily haue temporized in that cauſe, to pleaſe the Emperour, and for his intereſts, had proceeded againſt that King, who otherwiſe was well affected, and deſerued well of the Apoſtolike Sea. To weigh downe theſe offences, the Pope put in the other ballance, that the French King had made ſo many lawes and edicts before named, to preſerue religion and his authoritie. Vnto which was added that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſian Diuines the firſt of Auguſt, aſſembling the people by the ſound of a Trumpet, publiſhed fiue and twentie heads of Chriſtian doctrine, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the bare concluſions and determinations, without adding reaſons, perſwaſions, or grounds, but onely preſcribing, as it were by authoritie, what they would haue beleeued; which were printed, and ſent through all <hi>France,</hi> confirmed by the Kings letters, vnder moſt grieuous puniſhments, againſt whoſoeuer ſpake or taught other wiſe, with another new Decree to make inquiſition againſt the Lutherans. Theſe things the rather plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Pope, becauſe he knew the King did them, not ſo much for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon related before, that is, to iuſtifie himſelfe to the world that hee made not warre with the Emperour to fauour the Lutherans doctrine, nor to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their extirpation, but principally to pleaſe him, and for reuerence of the Apoſtolicall Sea.</p>
            <p>But the Emperour knowing the Popes complaints, anſwered, that the <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors anſwere to the Popes complaints.</note> French King hauing made a League with the Turke to the preiudice of Chriſtians (as the ſiege of <hi>Nizza</hi> in <hi>Prouence,</hi> made by the Ottoman Armie, guided by <hi>Polinus</hi> the Kings Abaſſadour, and the ſpoiles taken in the riuers of the Kingdome, well ſhewed) it was lawfull for him to vſe, for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the helpe of the King of <hi>England,</hi> a Chriſtian, though he acknowledge not the Pope; as alſo, by the ſame Popes leaue, himſelfe and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> vſed the aſſiſtance of the Proteſtants, more auerſe from the Apoſtolike Sea then that King; that the Pope, vnderſtanding the League of the French King with the Turke, ſhould haue proceeded againſt him. But hee ſaw well what difference was made. For the Turkiſharmie, which had ſo much dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified all the Chriſtians whereſoeuer it went, paſſed friendly by the Popes riuers, yea going to <hi>Oſtia</hi> to take in the freſh water on S. <hi>Peters</hi> day at night, for which all <hi>Rome,</hi> was in confuſion, the Cardinall of <hi>Carpi,</hi> who commanded in the Popes name that was abſent, put them out of feare, being ſecure by the intelligence which he had with the Turkes.</p>

The buſineſſe of religion was much conſidered on But becauſe the affayres of the warre preſſed them more, it was referred to the Diet; which was to bee ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated in December, and in the meane ſpace, a Decree was made, that the Emperour ſhould giue charge to ſome honeſt and learned men to write a forme of reformation, and that all the Princes ſhould doe the ſame, that all being conferred together, that might bee determined in the Diet by common conſent, which was to be obſerued vntil the future generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, to be held in <hi>Germany,</hi> or vntill a Nationall. In the meane ſpace that all ſhould remaine in peace, without raiſing any tumult for Religion, and the Churches of the one and the other ſhould enioy their goods. This Receſſe did not generally pleaſe the Catholikes; but ſome of them, becauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the Proteſtants opinion, approoued this middle way. Thoſe that were not contented, ſeeing their number to be ſmall, reſolue to endure it.</p>
            <p>But the warre went on ſtill; and the Popes diſdaine conceiued for the league with <hi>England,</hi> did waxe greater, for that the Emperour had neuer <note place="margin">The Popes diſdaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperour is increaſed.</note> aſſented to any of thoſe maine and ample matches offered him by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Farneſe,</hi> whom he ſent Legate with him into <hi>Germany,</hi> concerning the grant of the Dutchie of <hi>Milan</hi> to the Familie of the <hi>Farneſi;</hi> and, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſiſt in the Diet of <hi>Spira,</hi> he would not ſuffer the Cardinall Legate to follow him thither for feare of offending the Proteſtants. And finally, conſidering the Decree made in the Diet, ſo preiudiciall to him and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique ſea, he was more offended, becauſe hee ſaw his hopes loſt, and his authoritie and reputation much diminiſhed, and iudged it neceſſarie to ſhew he was ſenſible of it. And though on (the other ſide hee conſidered that his partie in <hi>Germany</hi> was weakened, and was counſelled by his moſt inward friends to diſſemble, yet finally, beeing aſſured, that by declaring himſelfe openly againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> hee did more ſtraitly binde the <hi>French</hi> King to maintaine his reputation, hee reſolued to begin from wordes to take occaſion to paſſe to deeds, as the coniunctures ſhould comport.</p>
            <p>And the fifth of Auguſt he wrote a great long letter to the Emperor; the ſubſtance whereof was; That hauing vnderſtood what decrees were made <note place="margin">The Pope writeth a long angry letter to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> in <hi>Spira,</hi> his duty and fatherly charitie did inforce him to tell him his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he might not follow the example of <hi>Ely</hi> the Prieſt, whom God ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely puniſhed for his too much indulgence towards his ſonnes. That the Decrees of <hi>Spira</hi> were dangerous for the Emperours ſoule, and extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17208:63"/>
troubled the Church; that hee ſhould not violate the rules obſerued by Chriſtians, which command that, in the cauſe of religion, all ſhould bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and yet hee, not eſteeming the Pope, who onely, by the law of God and man, hath power to call Councels. And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree in ſpirituall matters, was willing to thinke of aſſembling a Generall of Nationall Councell; and hath ſuffered Idiots and Heretiques to iudge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: hath made decrees concerning ſacred goods, reſtored to honour the rebels of the Church, whom he had condemned by his owne Edicts: that he is willing to beleeue that hee hath not done theſe things by his owne inclination, but by the pernicious counſell of thoſe that beare ill will to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he complaineth of this, that he hath yeelded vnto them; that the Scripture is full of examples of the wrath of God, againſt the vſurpers of the office of the High Prieſt, of <hi>Vzza, Dathan, Abiron,</hi> and <hi>Core,</hi> of King <hi>Ozias,</hi> and others.

Whereupon he hearkened to the propoſitions of peace made by the French men, with deſigne not onely to be freed from that impediment, but, by the Kings meanes, to accommodate the Turkiſh affaires, and applie himſelfe vnto <hi>Germanie.</hi> The foure and twentieth of September the peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded betweene them, and amongſt other things they both capitulated to defend the old Religion, and to labour for the vnion of the Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence all the diſſenſions are deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that, for this purpoſe, the Pope ſhould ioyntly be requeſted to call the Councell, and the French King ſhould ſend to the Diet of <hi>Germanie,</hi> to perſwade the Proteſtants to accept it. The Pope was not afraide of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation for the Councell, and reformation of the Court, being aſſured that whenſoeuer they began that enterpriſe, by reaſon of their diuers ends and intereſts, they would not long agree: neither did he doubt, but that the deſigne being to be executed by a Councell, he would ſo accommodate euery treatie, that his authoritie ſhould be amplified. But he thought that in caſe he ſhould call the Councell at their requeſt, the world would imagine he was conſtrained, which would bring much diſhonour to his reputation, and incouragement to him that deſigned the moderation of the Papall power.

He ſaw the terme was ſtraight, and not ſufficient to giue notice through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, much leſſe to giue the Prelates ſpace to put themſelues in order, and make the iourney: Yet he thought it aduantage, that, in caſe it were to bee celebrated, it ſhould beginne with few, and thoſe Italians, Courtiers, and his dependants, whom hee had ſolicited to bee there firſt, becauſe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding in the Councell ſhould bee handled in the beginning <note place="margin">The Popes Bull of the conuocation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> (which is the principall, yea the onely thing to preſerue the Pontificall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie) vnto whoſe determination they who daily arriued would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſtand.

And hauing penetrated the true cauſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the peace, he wrote to the Emperour, that he had vſed preuention and celeritie to intimate the Councell, to doe him ſeruice. For knowing that his Maieſtie was conſtrained, by reaſon of the French warre, to permit, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe many things to the Proteſtants, by intimating the Councell he had now giuen him a meanes to excuſe himſelfe in the Diet, which was to be in September, if, the Councell approaching, hee performed not what hee had promiſed to grant vntill the Councell.</p>
            <p>But the Popes haſtineſſe pleaſed not the Emperour, nor the reaſon gaue him ſatisfaction.

            <p>The French King alſo aſſembled at <hi>Melun</hi> the Pariſian Diuines, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of the neceſſarie poſitions of the Chriſtian Faith, to be propoſed in the Councell: where there was much contention.

            <p>But the Pope, ſignifying to the French King how little good will the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror bare him, deſired him, for the maintenance of the Apoſtolike Sea, to ſend Ambaſſadors to the Councell as ſoone as might be, and charged his <hi>Nuncio</hi> reſiding with the Emperor, that, attending all occaſions when the Proteſtants gaue him any diſtaſte, he ſhould offer all aſſiſtance from him, to recouer the Imperiall authoritie, with Spirituall and Temporall aydes.

            <p>The Pope made great haſte, not onely to call the Councell, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch <note place="margin">The Pope diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcheth the Legates to <hi>Trent.</hi>

            <p>But beſides the care the Pope had for the affaires of <hi>Trent,</hi> another of no leſſe moment troubled his minde, concerning the Diet to be celebrated in <hi>Wormes,</hi> where he thought the Emperour would not be preſent, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Cardinall <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> is ſent to the Diet of <hi>Wormes,</hi> and to the Emperour.</note> that, being prouoked by the letter written vnto him, he would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand cauſe ſome Decree to be made, more preiudiciall to his affaires then the former, or at the leaſt giue way vnto it; he thought it neceſſarie to haue in that place a miniſter of authoritie and reputation, with title of Legate. But he feared an affront that way, in caſe the Diet ſhould not receiue him with due honour. He found out a temper, to ſend to the Emperor the Cardinall <hi>Farneſe</hi> his nephew, and make him paſſe by <hi>VVormes,</hi> and there to giue inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the Catholikes, and, after he had made the treaties that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, to goe forward toward the Emperour, and in the meane ſpace to

            <p>Afterwards applying his minde to <hi>Trent,</hi> hee cauſed a conſultation to be begun concerning the faculties to be giuen to the Legats. This had ſome difficultie, becauſe they had no examples to follow. For in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell next preceding, the Pope was perſonally preſent; before in the Florentine <note place="margin">A conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the faculties to be giuen to the Legats.</note> 
               <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth was preſent, and that of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where the Schiſme was taken away, began with the preſence of <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23. one of the three depoſed Popes and ended with the preſence of <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth. Before that, the Councell of <hi>Piſa</hi> was called by the Cardinals, and concluded by <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the fifth. And in more ancient times, <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth was preſent in the Councell of <hi>Vienna;</hi> in the two Councels of <hi>Lions, Innocence</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Gregorie</hi> the tenth; and before theſe in the <hi>Lateran, Innocence</hi> 3. Onely the Councell of <hi>Baſil,</hi> at that time when it obeyed <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by Legats. But to imitate any thing that was there obſerued was too bad a preſage. Hee reſolued to frame the Bull, with this clauſe, that he ſent <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Bull.</note> them as Angels of peace to the Councell, which before hee had intimated in <hi>Trent:</hi> and gaue them full and free authoritie, that, for want of that, the celebration and continuation might not bee hindred, with facultie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide there, and to ordaine any Decrees or Statutes whatſoeuer, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them in the Seſſions according to cuſtome: to propoſe, conclude, and execute whatſoeuer was neceſſary, to condemne errours and roote them out of all Prouinces and Kingdomes: to take knowledge, heare, decide, and determine the cauſes of hereſie, and whatſoeuer elſe concerneth the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith: to reforme the State of the holy Church in all her members, aſwel Eccleſiaſticall as Secular: to make peace amongſt Chriſtian Princes, and to determine any thing elſe which may bee for the honour of God the increaſe of Chriſtian faith: with authoritie to bridle, with cenſures and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call puniſhments, all contradicting and rebellious perſons, of what ſtate or preeminence ſoeuer, though graced with Pontificall or Regall dignity; and to doe any thing elſe neceſſary and fit for the extirpation of hereſies and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and the reducing of thoſe people that are aliened from the obedience of the Apoſtolique Sea, preſeruation, and reſtauration of Eccleſiaſticall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie; yet with condition, that in all things they proceede with conſent of the Councell.</p>
            <p>But the Pope, conſidering not onely how to ſet the Councell forward, but of the meanes to diſſolue it when it was begun, in caſe his ſeruice did <note place="margin">The Bull for the diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Councell.</note> require it, to prouide for himſelfe in good time, he followed the example of <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, who for feare of thoſe encounters which happened to <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23. in <hi>Constance,</hi> when hee ſent <hi>Nuncij</hi> to the Councell of <hi>Pania,</hi> gaue them a particular Briefe, with authoritie to prolong, diſſolue, or tranſlate it to what place they would; A ſecret to croſſe all deliberation which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the intereſts of <hi>Rome.</hi> A few dayes after hee made another Bull, giuing the Legates power to transferre the Councell.

The Legates grant an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence without authoritie.</note> arriued in <hi>Trent,</hi> and were receiued by the Cardinall of that place. That day they made their publike entrie, and granted three yeeres, and ſo many times forty dayes of Indulgence, to thoſe that were preſent. They had not this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from the Pope, but hoped he would ratifie the fact. They found no Prelate there, though the Pope had cauſed ſome to part from <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might be preſent at the prefixed time.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing the Legates did, was to conſider of the contents of the Bull of Faculties giuen them, and reſolued to keepe it ſecret, and ſent aduice to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the condition, to proceede with conſent of the Councell, tied them too much, and made them equall to euery pettie Prelate, and would breed great difficulties in the gouernment, in caſe it were neceſſarie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate euery particular vnto all; and ſaid it was to giue too much libertie or rather licence to the multitude. It was perceiued in <hi>Rome</hi> that the reaſons were good, and the Bull was corrected according to the aduice, and abſolute <note place="margin">The Bull was corrected.</note> authority was giuen them. But the Legates, while they expected an anſwere, appoynted out the place for the Seſſion, capable of 400. perſons, within the Cathedrall Church.</p>

               <hi>Don Diego de Mendoza,</hi> the Emperors Ambaſſador with the Republique <note place="margin">Don Diego <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth to</hi> Trent.</note> of <hi>

And they were, <hi>Thomas Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegio</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Feltre,</hi> the Cardinals nephew, <hi>Thomas</hi> of S. <hi>Felicius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caua,</hi> Friar <hi>Cornelius Muſſus,</hi> a Franciſcan, Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto,</hi> the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent Preacher of thoſe times. Foure dayes after, <hi>Don Diego</hi> made his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in writing; which ſhewed the Emperors good diſpoſition concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the celebration of the Councell, and that order was giuen to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of <hi>Spaine</hi> to be there, who he thought were already in their iourney; he excuſed himſelfe by reaſon of his indiſpoſition for not being there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, deſired that the actions of the Councell, and the reformation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might begin, as was propoſed two yeeres before in the ſame place, by the Lord <hi>Granuel</hi> and himſelfe. The Legates anſwered in writing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the Emperour, receiuing his perſonall excuſe, and ſhewing their deſire of the Prelates comming thither. And the propoſition and anſwere were receiued by the parties vnto whom it belonged, in the points not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to the rights of their Princes reſpectiuely. A caution which giueth a manifeſt argument, with what charitie they treated in the propoſition and anſwere, where there were onely words of pure complement, except the mention of reformation.</p>
            <p>The Legates not knowing which way to treate, made demonſtration to <note place="margin">The Legates deſire to haue two ſorts of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</note> proceed ioyntly with the Ambaſſadors and Prelates, and to communicate to them their moſt inward thoughts; whereupon when letters came from <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Germanie,</hi> they aſſembled all to reade them. But perceiuing that <hi>Don Diego</hi> equalized himſelfe to them, and the Biſhops preſumed more then they were wont to doe at <hi>Rome,</hi> and fearing ſome inconuenience would ariſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17208:67"/>
when their number did encreaſe, they ſent aduiſe to <hi>Rome</hi> that alwaies one letter ſhould be written to bee ſhewed, and the ſecret things apart, becauſe of the letters which they had receiued vntill then, they had made no vſe but by their wit. They demanded alſo a cipher, to communicate the matters of greater moment. All which particularities, with many more that ſhall bee ſpoken of, hauing taken out of the Regiſter of the letters of the Cardinall of <hi>Monte,</hi> I haue not beene willing to conceale them, becauſe they ſerue to penetrate the depth of the treaties.</p>
            <p>The moneth of March beeing paſt, and the time, prefixed in the Popes Bull, to beginne the Councel expired many dayes, the Legates conſulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues concerning the opening of it, and reſolued to expect ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe from <hi>Fabius Magnanellus, Nuncio</hi> with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> of what was handled in <hi>Wormes,</hi> and order from <hi>Rome,</hi> after the Pope had heard of the arriuall and propoſition of <hi>Don Diego;</hi> and the rather, becauſe they were aſhamed to make ſo great a beginning with three Biſhops onely. The Ambaſſadours of the King of the Romanes arriued the eight of April, and a ſolemne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was made to receiue them. In that <hi>Don Diego</hi> would haue prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Cardinall of <hi>Trent,</hi> and ſate next the Legates, ſaying that in regard he repreſented the Emperour, he ought to ſit in the ſame place where his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie <note place="margin">
                  <hi>D. Diego</hi> would haue preceded the Cardinall of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> ſhould. But not to hinder the buſineſſe, they found out a way to place them ſo that it could not appeare who had the precedence.</p>
            <p>The Kings Ambaſſadours preſented onely their Prince his letter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by word of mouth, his obſeruance towards the Apoſtolique Sea and the Pope, his readineſſe to fauour the Councell, and large offers: and they <note place="margin">The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of the K. of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</note> added that hee would ſend a commiſſion in forme, and perſons better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed.</p>
            <p>After this, the wiſhed for aduiſe came to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> of the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in the Diet the 24. of March by King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who was Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there in the Emperours name, and of the negotiation which followed thereupon. The Kings propoſition was, that the Emperor had made peace with the French King, that he might apply himſelfe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſe the differences of religion, and proſecute the warre againſt the Turkes; from whom he had <note place="margin">The propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> in the Diet.</note> promiſe of aſſiſtance, and an approbation of the Councel, with a reſolution to be there in perſon, or by his Ambaſſadors. That for this end, it being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prorogued, hee had dealt with the Pope to intimate it againe, and ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to giue ayde againſt the Turkes. That he had obtained the intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Holineſſe, and that Ambaſſadors ſent from the Emperor and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe were already in <hi>Trent.</hi> That all the world knew what paines <hi>Caeſar</hi> had taken to cauſe the Councel to bee celebrated; firſt with <hi>Clement</hi> in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> then with <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rome, Genua, Nizza, Lucca,</hi> and <hi>Buſſeto.</hi> That according to the Decree of <hi>Spira,</hi> he had giuen order to men of learning and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to compoſe a forme of reformation; which was accordingly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But it being a thing of great deliberation, and the time ſhort, and the Turkiſh warre threatning them, the Emperour was reſolued not to ſpeake of this any more, but to expect how the Councel would proceed, and what might bee hoped from it, becauſe it was ſuddenly to beginne, and in caſe no fruit appeared, hee might before the end of that Diet, intimate another to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17208:67"/>
handle all that buſineſſe, applying himſelfe how to that which is of more importance, that is, the Turkiſh warre.</p>
            <p>This propoſition made the Proteſtants very ſuſpitious. For the peace of religion being to laſt vntill the Councell, they were in doubt that when they were exhauſted, by contributions againſt the Turkes, they ſhould be aſſailed, vpon pretence that the peace was ended by opening the Councel in <hi>Trent.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The ſuſpition of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> Yet they demanded that the treatie begun ſhould bee continued, alleadging that the time was long enough to him that feared God; or at leaſt that a new peace ſhould be eſtabliſhed vntill a lawfull Councel, ſo often promiſed, ſuch as that of <hi>Trent</hi> was not, for the reaſons ſo many times rehearſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And they declared that they could not contribute, if they had not aſſurance of peace, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed to the Popes Councell, which they had refuſed whenſoeuer it was ſpoken of. And though the Eccleſiaſtiques did conſent abſolutely, that the cauſe of religion ſhould be wholly remitted to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, yet it was reſolued to expect the Emperours anſwere before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
            <p>Three particulars in this action diſpleaſed the Pope and Legate which <note place="margin">The Pope and the Legates were diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with three particulars in the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> were at <hi>Trent.</hi> One, that the Emperour arrogated to himſelfe, to haue indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Pope to celebrate the Councell, which argued ſmall care of Religion in his Holineſſe. The ſecond, that he had induced the <hi>French</hi> King to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto it, which was no honour to his ſanctitie, to whom this belonged. The third, that hee would ſtill keepe the bit in his mouth by a future Diet, that, in caſe the Councel went not forward, hee ſhould alwayes feare, that things concerning Religion ſhould be treated of in the Diet. The Pope was perpetually troubled, not ſo much for the iniuries receiued from the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, as for the Emperours actions, which, as hee was wont to ſay, though they ſeemed fauourable, yet were more pernicious to religion, and his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which could not be ſeparated. Beſides, it ſeemed he was alwayes in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that the Emperour would make ſome accord with the Dutch-men, to his preiudice. And thinking how to prouide a remedie, hee could finde none, but to ſet on foote a warre for Religion, becauſe the Proteſtants would bee curbed, and the Emperour likewiſe intangled in a dangerous enterpriſe, and all ſpeech of reformation and the Councell would bee buried in ſilence. He had great hope it would ſucceede, by that which his <hi>Nuncio</hi> wrote vnto him, that hee found in the Emperour great diſdaine againſt the Proteſtants, and that he hearkened to his propoſitions to ſubdue them by force. For this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, beſide that which was before related, and to hinder that no preiudiciall thing might bee done in the Diet, and to encourage and giue ſtrength to his followers, another cauſe was added, more vrgent, becauſe it belonged to his priuate interest. For being reſolued to giue <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza</hi> to his ſon, <note place="margin">The Pope is reſolued to giue <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza</hi> to his ſonne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> but feareth the Emperour.</note> hee thought he could not doe it without great danger, if the Emperour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented not; becauſe he might find pretences, either for that thoſe cities were formerly members of the Dutchie of <hi>Milan,</hi> or might ſay, the Church ſhould not be damnified, whereof he was aduocate. To diſpatch theſe buſineſſes, he ſent Cardinall <hi>Farneſe</hi> into <hi>Germanie,</hi> with inſtructions neceſſary.</p>
            <p>But the Legats in <hi>Trent</hi> had commiſſion from the Pope, to open the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell with thoſe few Prelats that were there, without expecting a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17208:68"/>
in caſe they vnderſtood that they would treate of Religion in the Dier; but if not, to gouerne themſelues as other reſpects ſhould aduiſe. They ſaw that the propoſing of the Diet did not binde them, but, on the other ſide, that the ſmall number of Prelates (who then were not more then foure) perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a prorogation. Notwithſtanding, they were in doubt that the danger of the Turkiſh armes would conſtraine <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to make the <hi>Receſſe,</hi> and, <note place="margin">The Legate know not what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue about the opening of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> according to promiſe, to intimate another Diet, in which Religion ſhould be treated of: caſting the blame vpon them, by ſaying that notice was giuen them of the propoſition, that, knowing what was promiſed with good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, they might haue hindered the execution of it by opening the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. For this cauſe they ſent in diligence to the Pope, to receiue order from him what to doe in this doubtfull conſultation, ſeeing themſelues on the one ſide conſtrained by a potent reſpect to make haſte, and on the other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to deſiſt, becauſe they were almoſt alone in <hi>Trent.</hi> They declared to the Pope that they had many coniectures, and ſignes, that the Emperour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not the celebration of the Councell; that <hi>Don Diego,</hi> after his firſt comparition, had neuer ſpoken ſo much as one word, and did ſhew, as it were, in his countenance, that he was pleaſed with that leaſure and ſpending of time. For his appearance onely was ſufficient to excuſe and iuſtifie his Maſter, that hauing, by himſelfe and his Ambaſſadors, continually deſired and ſollicited the Councell, and brought the buſineſſe to that paſſe, and not ſeeing a conuenient progreſſe, hee might and ought to intimate another Diet, to determine the cauſe of Religion, as by reaſon deuolued vnto him by his owne diligence, and negligence of the Pope. They reſolued to take a <note place="margin">It is reſolued that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ſhould be opened, onely by ſinging a Maſſe of the holy Ghoſt.</note> middle courſe: that is, to ſing a Maſſe of the holy Ghoſt, before the Emperor arriued in the Diet; which might ſtand for a beginning of the Councell, and preuent whatſoeuer the Emperour could doe in the <hi>Receſſe,</hi> and, on the other ſide, remoue all occaſion of ſaying, that the matters of the Councell were begun to be handled with foure perſons; remaining in libertie to enioy the benefit of time, and to be able to goe on, or deſiſt, or transferre, or ſhut vp the Councell, as the occurrences ſhould aduiſe. They wiſhed him to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that if the Councell were opened, after that Cardinall <hi>Farneſe</hi> had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the Emperor, one might thinke that Cardinall was ſent to entreate that it might not be opened, and could not obtaine it. Beſides, the fame of the Turkiſh Armie increaſing, it would be ſaid it was opened when neceſſitie compelled to thinke of other matters, and when it was knowne it could not be done. The Cardinall <hi>Santa Croce</hi> deſired much that ſignes of deuotion <note place="margin">The deſire of the Cardinall <hi>Santa Croce.</hi>

That Cardinall was ſerupulous, that the people which were preſent at that entrie, ſhould not be defrauded of thoſe three yeeres and thrice fortie daies which they granted, and would ſupplie it by this; not conſidering that a difficultie did ariſe, whether he that hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to grant Indulgences, can make good thoſe which another hath granted without authoritie.</p>

Hauing well conſidered all the reaſons which perſwaded and diſſwaded to begin the Councell, for diſſwaſion hee ſaw no weightie reaſon but this, that when the Councell ſhould be opened, hee would be intreated to leaue it ſo, vntill the impediments of the Turkiſh warre, and others, did ceaſe: which was to put a bridle in his mouth, which would turne him whither he pleaſed that held the raines: a thing dangerous to his affaires.

A little after Cardinall <hi>Farneſe,</hi> in his iourney towards, <hi>Wormes,</hi> arriued in <hi>Trent,</hi> and brought the ſame commiſſion; and all being conſulted of betweene him and the Legats, they reſolued to continue, notifying vnto all, the Commiſſion to open the Conncell in generall, without deſcending to the particular day, more then this, that it ſhould bee when hee had ſpoken with the Emperour in <hi>Wormes.</hi> And they conceiued good hope; becauſe they vnderſtood that his Maieſtie, knowing the diſpatch of the Legation, was much ſatisfied with the Pope, and declared that hee would ioyntly proceede with him; and therefore they would not go on to any new action, without his knowledge, for feare of diſturbing him; and the rather becauſe <hi>Don Diego,</hi> and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Trent</hi> aduiſed the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Diego</hi> renewed his pretence, to precede all but the Legates, alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">

The Legates anſwered in generall termes onely, that they were ready to giue euery man his place, expecting orders from <hi>Rome;</hi> which pleaſed <hi>Don Diego,</hi> hoping that deciſions and examples thereof would bee found in the publike Records; ſhewing hee was readie out of the Councell, to giue place to euery pettie Prieſt, but adding that, in the Councell, none after the Pope, had more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie then his Prince. Some that reade this relation may thinke it ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous,

becauſe it containeth matter of ſmall weight: but, contrarily, the writer of the Storie hath thought neceſſarie to make knowne, from how ſmall riuers ſo great a lake, which poſſeſſeth all <hi>Europe,</hi> hath been raiſed; and he that ſhall ſee how many letters went to and fro before the opening was concluded, would wonder at the eſteeme was made of it, and at the ſurmiſes that did flie abroad.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Italie,</hi> becauſe they ſaw the Councell went on, and hoped that now it would be celebrated, the Biſhops thought of their iourney. The Vice-roy of <hi>Naples</hi> tooke care that all his ſhould not goe. His will was to ſend <note place="margin">The Vice-roy of <hi>Naples</hi> would ſend but foure bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to the Councell, and thoſe of his owne nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and is much oppoſed.</note> foure of his owne nomination, with commiſſion from the reſt of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which are aboue an hundred. Therefore the great Chaplaine of the kingdome aſſembled the Prelates in his houſe, and intimated vnto them, that they ſhould make a proxie. Many oppoſed, and ſaid they would goe in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe they were ſo bound by oath: but in caſe they could not, it was reaſonable that euery one ſhould name a Proctor, according to his owne conſcience, and not one for all. The Vice-roy was angrie, and gaue order againe to the great Chaplaine to call them, and command them to make the proxie, and ſent the like order to all the gouernours of the Kingdome. This troubled the Pope and Legates very much, becauſe they knew not whether it came from the Viceroy his owne fantaſie, to ſhew himſelfe a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient man, or from want of wit, or whether ſome other had made him doe it, and proceeded from a deeper roote. To diſcouer from whence this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue came, the Pope made a ſeuere Bull, that none, without exception, ſhould <note place="margin">The Pope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a ſeuere Bull, that none ſhould appeare in Councell by Proctor.</note> appeare by Proctor. This the Legates concealed, as being too ſeuere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it contained all the Prelates of Chriſtendome, euen the moſt remote, and thoſe that had lawfull impediment, who could not poſsibly obſerue it: and alſo becauſe it was too rigid, conſtituting that they incurred <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> the puniſhment of ſuſpenſion from their Miniſterie. And they feared it would cauſe many irregularities, nullities of actes, and vndue receiuings of fruits, and that by this meanes ſome diſcontented Nation might be ſtirred vp to appeale and conteſt for iuriſdiction. Wherefore they wrote, that they ought not to publiſh it without new commiſsion, thinking the rumor that the Bull was made would ſuffice, though it were not ſhewed. What end this Bull had, ſhall be declared in its fit place.</p>
            <p>Another buſineſſe remained, though of ſmaller moment, yet no leſſe troubleſome. The Legats, vntill then, had receiued but ſmall ſtore of money <note place="margin">The Legates require money for the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Councell.</note> for their expences, and were too poore to ſupplie out of their owne, as was fit for them to doe in ſome particular; in ſo much, that if they ſo continued, they ſhould not be able to maintaine themſelues. Whereupon they did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it to <hi>Farneſe,</hi> and wrote to the Pope, that it was not for his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to hold a Councell without neceſſarie and accuſtomed ornaments, with that luſtre that ſo great an aſſembly required; for which it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to ſend ſome perſon, to vndergoe this charge only: and therefore it would be good to appoynt a Depoſitarie, with a ſumme of money, to diſcharge the occurring expences, to aſsiſt ſome needie Prelate, and to cheriſh ſome man of account: a thing neceſſarie to procure a good end of the Councell.</p>
            <p>The third of May, ten Biſhops being then arriued, they made a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <note place="margin">The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpent in ceremonies.</note>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:17208:69"/>
to eſtabliſh the things that ſhould goe before; in which they publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie intimated the Popes commiſſion to open the Councell, adding, that they would not determine of the day, vntill they had imparted it to the Emperor. This Congregation, for the moſt part, was ſpent in matters of ceremonie, that the Legates, though of diuers Orders, one being a Biſhop, another a Prieſt, and the third a Deacon, ſhould notwithſtanding haue the ſame orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wearing Rochets all three alike, as their office and authoritie was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in one Legation and one Preſidencie; that the place for the Seſſions ſhould be beautified with hangings of Arras, that it might not ſeeme an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of mechanicall men. They propoſed whether it were fit to make ſeats for the Pope and Emperor, which ſhould be adorned and remaine emptie: they treated whether it were fit to giue <hi>Don Diego</hi> a more honorable place then the other Ambaſſadours. It was conſidered that the Biſhops of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> who are Princes of the Empire, doe pretend right of preceding all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prelates, euen Archbiſhops, alle aging that it is not onely ſo obſerued in the Diets, but alſo that the Biſhops which are not Princes ſtand bare before them. It was remembred, that the yeere before, there was a difference in the ſame Citie, where the Biſhop of <hi>Heicstat,</hi> and the Archbiſhops of <hi>Corſu</hi> and <hi>Ottranto</hi> met together at a Maſſe. Some alſo alleaged, that in the Popes chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the Biſhops that are Ambaſſadours for Dukes, and other Princes, doe precede the Archbiſhops, and therefore that the Princes themſelues ſhould doe it much more. And they concluded to reſolue nothing herein vntill the Councell were more frequent, that they might ſee how the French men and Spaniards did vnderſtand it. They thought fit to renew the Decree of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and of <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond, in the <hi>Laterane</hi> Councell, that it ſhould preiudice no man to ſit out of his place. The reſolution to expect the aduice of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> to determine the day of opening the Councell, gaue much ſatisfaction to <hi>Don Diego;</hi> and thoſe few Biſhops ſhewed much deuotion and obedience to the Pope, as did alſo the Biſhop of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ercells,</hi> who arriued the ſame day after the Congregation ended, together with Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> the third Legate.</p>
            <p>While they met in <hi>Trent</hi> to conuince hereſies by a Councell, in <hi>France</hi> they did the ſame by force of armes, againſt a ſmall remainder of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> inhabitants of the <hi>Alpes</hi> of <hi>Prouence,</hi> who (as hath been ſaid before) maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſeparation from the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> with a diuerſe doctrine and rites, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfect and rude. Theſe men, after the reformations of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged their doctrine by his, and reduced their rites vnto ſome forme, at the ſame time when <hi>Geneua</hi> embraced the reformation. Sentence was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt theſe many yeeres before, by the Parliament of <hi>Aix,</hi> which had neuer been executed. The King now commanded to execute the ſentence.

            <p>But in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Emperour arriued in <hi>VVormes</hi> the 16. of May, and Cardinall <hi>Farneſe</hi> the day following, who treated with him, and with the <note place="margin">Cardinall <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> his nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation with the Emperour in <hi>Wormes.</hi>
               </note> King of the <hi>Romans</hi> apart. He deliuered his commiſſions particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Councell, declaring that the Pope had giuen the Legats power to open it: which they meant to doe when they ſhould vnderſtand from him, what was done in the Diet. Hee told the Emperour, that it was not neceſſary to regard the oppoſitions of the Proteſtants, ſeeing that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment, alleaged by them, was not new, but was foreſeene from the day the Councell was firſt ſpoken of: that he might aſſure himſelfe, that they, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing caſt off the yoke of obedience, the principall foundation of Religion, and proceeded to ſo impious &amp; wicked innouatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, againſt the rites, obſerued many hundreds of yeres, by the approbation of ſo many famous Councels, they would, with the ſame boldneſſe, ſpurne againſt the Councell, which was to begin, though lawfull, generall, and Chriſtian, aſſuring themſelues to be condemned by it. Therefore that nothing remained, but that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty ſhould induce them to obedience by authority, or conſtraine them by force. Which, in caſe it were not done, and they ſo much regarded, as not to bee condemned, or, after condemnation, not conſtrained to lay aſide their errours, all the world would know that the heretiques command, and the Pope and Emperour obey. That his Holineſſe as he thought fit to vſe mildneſſe at the firſt, ſo he thought it neceſſary to ſhew really, that after it would follow force of Armes. That he offered him a grant of part of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical reuenues of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and power to ſell the plate of thoſe Churches, to aſſiſt him with his owne money, and to ſend him out of <hi>Italy</hi> 12000. foot, and 500. horſe paide, and to endeuour that he might likewiſe be aſſiſted by other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to proceed, during the time of the warres, with ſpirituall and temporall Armes, againſt whoſoeuer ſhould moleſt his terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories. <hi>Farneſe</hi> declared alſo to the Emperour the attempt of the Vice roy of <note place="margin">He complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the Vice roy of <hi>Naples.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Naples,</hi> who would haue ſent foure Proctors in the name of all the Biſhops of the Kingdome, ſhewing it was neither reaſonable nor lawfull, and that it was a diſhonour to the Councell: For if Biſhops, dwelling ſo neere, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many, might be excuſed by ſending foure, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> might doe it much rather, and ſo a Generall Councell ſhould be held with twenty Biſhops. And he prayed the Emperour not to tolerate a thing ſo contrary to the authority of the Pope, and dignity of the Councell, whereof himſelfe is Protector, deſiring him to giue ſome remedy heerein. The Cardinall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo treated with him concerning the promiſe made in his Maieſties name, in the propoſition ſent to the Diet; that is, that to determine the controuerſies of Religion, in caſe the Councell did not proceed, another Diet ſhould be held; and deſired him to conſider, that if neither his Holineſſe, nor his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats and Miniſters, nor the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> were in fault that the Councell were not celebrated, nor proceeded, he could not by any meanes intimate in the <hi>Receſſe</hi> another Diet, vnder this colour. And he inculcated this poynt
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:17208:70"/>
exceedingly, becauſe hee had ſtrait commiſſion therein from <hi>Rome;</hi> and becauſe the Cardinall of <hi>Monte,</hi> a man very free, not onely ſpake but alſo wrote vnto him thereof, in his owne name and his colleagues, after that hee parted from <hi>Trent,</hi> ſaying in plaine termes, that this was the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant point at which he ſhould euer ayme, without forgetting it in his whole negotiation, taking care not to admit any excuſe, becauſe this onely would produce any other good agreement. And for his owne part, hee would put his Holineſſe in minde rather to abandon the Sea, and reſtore the keyes to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> then ſuffer the Secular power to arrogate authoritie to determine cauſes of Religion, vnder pretence and colour that the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall hath failed in celebrating a Councell or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Concerning the attempt of the Viceroy, the Emperor ſaid it proceeded from his owne proper motion, from which, in caſe hee had not great reaſon to the contrary, hee would bee remooued. For opening the Councell hee <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors anſwere to the Legat.</note> gaue no reſolute anſwere, but ſpake diuerſly, ſometimes that it would bee good to begin it in a more fit place, ſometimes that it was neceſſary to make ſundry prouiſions firſt. Whereby the Cardinall ſaw plainely that his ayme was onely to hold the matter in ſuſpence, and to gouerne himſelfe as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerued, either opening or diſſoluing it. For not intimating another Diet to treate of religion, he gaue a generall and vnconcluding anſwere, that hee would alwayes make as much eſteeme as was poſſible of the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. But to the propoſition of making warre againſt the Lutherans, he anſwered that the Popes counſell was the beſt, and that the onely way was propoſed by him, which he was reſolued to imbrace; yet that hee would proceede with due caution, and firſt conclude a truce with the Turke, which hee then did mediate diligently, and moſt ſecretly, by the French King, and that hee knew well, that the number and power of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants was great, and inſuperable, and that in caſe they were not diuided or ſurpriſed at vnawares, the warre would prooue doubtfull and dangerous. That his deſigne was to conceale his purpoſe vntill opportunitie ſerued, and then to treate with the Pope. In the meane while hee accepted the offers made vnto him.</p>
            <p>Beſide theſe publike buſineſſes, the Cardinall had one priuate for his <note place="margin">The Legats priuate nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his owne family.</note> owne houſe. The Pope thinking it too little to giue to his familie the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Camerino,</hi> and <hi>Nepi,</hi> thought to giue them alſo <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza;</hi> which becauſe they were a little before in the poſſeſſion of the Dukes of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> he deſired the Emperours conſent, to eſtabliſh his gift the better. The Cardinall treated with the Emperour hereof, ſhewing it were better for his Maieſtie that thoſe Cities, ſo neere to the Dutchie of <hi>Milan,</hi> were in the poſſeſſion of a familie ſo deuoted and allied vnto him, then in the power of the Church, in which if an ill affected Pope ſhould ſucceede, diuers inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences might ariſe; that this would not bee an alienation of the patrimonie of the Church, becauſe they firſt came into the hands of <hi>Iulius</hi> 2. neither was the poſſeſſion of them well confirmed but vnder <hi>Leo;</hi> that it would bee more profitable for the Church, becauſe the Pope would giue it <hi>Camerino</hi> in exchange and that detracting the charge of maintaining the garriſons of thoſe two Cities, and adding eight thouſand crownes, which the new Duke
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17208:71"/>
would pay, the Church would receiue more rent by <hi>Camerino,</hi> then by them. To theſe expoſitions the Cardinall ioyned his daughters letters, who effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prayed the Emperour for her owne intereſt; vnto whom the matter was not diſpleaſing, as well for the affection hee bare to his daughter and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes, as becauſe it would bee more eaſie to recouer them from a Duke, then from the Church. Yet hee neither denied nor granted, but ſaid onely hee would not oppoſe. <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors anſwere.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Legate treated with the Catholikes, and the Eccleſiaſtikes eſpecially, incouraging them to defend the true Religion, &amp; promiſing them all fauour from the Pope. The Proteſtants ſuſpected the negotiation of the warre, though handled ſecretly, becauſe a Franciſcan Friar, preaching before <hi>Charles,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſuſpect that warre would bee made againſt them.</note> 
               <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the Legat, after a great inuectiue againſt the Lutherans, turned to the Emperour, and ſaid it was his office to defend the Church with armes; that vntil then he had not performed that which was neceſſary to be effected; that ſo many benefits which God had beſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, deſerued he ſhould make acknowledgement of them by ſetting himſelfe againſt that contagion of men, who ought not to liue any longer; and that he ought not to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further delay, becauſe many ſoules did dayly periſh by this meanes, for whom God will aske an account of him, if he gaue not ſome ſudden remedie. This Sermon not onely begat ſuſpition, but rayſed diſcourſes alſo that it had been commanded by the Legat, and by the publike exhortations, they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what the priuate were. To remedy which rumor, the Cardinal parted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly <note place="margin">The Legate doth ſecretly and ſuddenly returne into <hi>Italie.</hi>
               </note> by night, &amp; returned quickly into <hi>Italy.</hi> Yet the ſuſpicion of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants increaſed, by the aduiſes ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope, when he diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome Captaines, gaue them hope he would imploy them the next yeere.</p>
            <p>But the B. of <hi>Sidonium</hi> arriued in <hi>Trent</hi> the 18 of May, with a Friar, a Diuine, and a ſecular Doctor, as Proctors of the Elector Cardinall &amp; Arch-biſhop of <hi>Mentz.</hi> The B. made a ſhort oration of the Electors obedience to the Pope, and Apoſtolike Sea, much commending the celebration of the Councell, as the onely neceſſary remedy to thoſe wauerings of faith, and Catholike religion. The Legates, in their anſwere, commended the pietie and deuotion of that Prince; and for admitting his commiſſion, they ſaid, it was neceſſary to ſee it firſt, becauſe his Holineſſe had made a new prouiſion, that none could giue voice by proxie, and that they were in doubt, whether it comprehended a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, and a Prince; that they well knew the prerogatiue which his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie deſerued, whereunto they were moſt ready to giue all honour and reſpect. Theſe three men perceiuing the difficultie, were in a confuſion, and thought <note place="margin">The Proctors of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to leaue the Councell.</note> to depart. The Legats repented them of the anſwere, knowing of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it would be if the prime Prince and Prelate of <hi>Germanie,</hi> for dignitie and riches ſhould bee aliened from the Councel. And they wrought by way of mediation, dexterouſly made by the Cardinall of <hi>Trent,</hi> by the Ambaſſadours and others, that they would remaine, ſaying the Bull ſpake only of Italian Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and that the Legats were deceiued: which imputation they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to beare, that they might withſtand ſo great a diſorder.</p>
            <p>Wherefore they wrote to <hi>Rome,</hi> giuing an account of the ſucceſſe, &amp; deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whether they ſhould receiue them while the Bull was in force, adding that it ſeemed hard to repell the Proctors of ſo great a perſonage, who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17208:72"/>
held themſelues offended herewith, becauſe they thought it was to ſhew the world that which was contrary to the trueth, and to attribute to them the delay, which proceeded from the Emperour. And though they among themſelues reſolued to diſſemble, and to anſwere in generall termes, yet the Cardinall <hi>Monte</hi> could not bridle his libertie, but in making anſwere, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the end with perſwaſion to expect <hi>Don Diego,</hi> who had more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular commiſſions then hee. It was hard to entertaine and comfort the Prelates, who ill endured that idle delay, and eſpecially the poore ones, who wanted money, and not wordes. Wherefore they reſolued to giue at the Popes charge, fortie Ducats a yeere to the Biſhops of <hi>Nobili, Bertinoro,</hi> and <note place="margin">Money is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the poore Biſhops</note> 
               <hi>Chioza,</hi> who complained more then the reſt, and fearing that the munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence might giue pretence hereafter, they declared themſelues that it was for a ſubſidie, and not for prouiſion. They gaue the Pope an account by letter of what they had done, ſhewing him the neceſſitie to aſſiſt them with ſome greater ayde: but telling him withall, that it was not good to giue it as a firme prouiſion, that the Fathers might not ſeeme the ſtipendaries of his Holineſſe: which would cheriſh the Proteſtants excuſe, not to ſubmit themſelues to the Councel, becauſe it was compoſed only of thoſe that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on, and were obliged to the Pope.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time the Emperor, in <hi>Wormes,</hi> cited the Archbiſhip of <hi>Collen</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Collen</hi> is cited by the Emperour in <hi>Wormes.</hi>
               </note> to appeare before him within thirtie dayes, or to ſend a Proctor, to anſwere to the accuſations and imputations layd vpon him, commanding him in the meane ſpace not to make any innouation in Religion and Rites, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the things innouated to their former ſtate. <hi>Hermannus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> deſiring to reforme his Church, in the yeere 1536. called a Councell of the Biſhops his Suffragans, where many Decrees were made, and a booke printed, compoſed by <hi>Iohn Groperus,</hi> a Canoniſt, who, for ſeruice done to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was after created Cardinall by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth. But whether the Archbiſhop, and <hi>Groperus</hi> himſelfe were not ſatisfied with the reformation, or whether hee changed his opinion, hee aſſembled the Clergie and Nobility, and chiefe men of his ſtate in the yeere 1543. and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed another reformation. This, though it were approoued by many, pleaſed not the whole Clergie, yea, the maior part oppoſed it, and made <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perus</hi> their head, who before had giuen counſell for it, and promoted it. They entreated the Archbiſhop to deſiſt, and expect a generall Councell, or at the leaſt, an Imperiall Diet; which not being able to obtaine, in the yeere 1545 they appealed to the Pope, and to the Emperour, as ſupreme aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and protectour of the Church. The Archbiſhop publiſhed by a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that the appeale was friuolous, and that hee could not deſiſt from that which belonged to the glory of God, and amendment of the Church; that hee had not to doe either with the Lutherans or others, but that hee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the doctrine agreeable to the holy Scripture. The Archbiſhop going on in his reformation, and the Clergie of <hi>Collen</hi> inſiſting vpon the contrary, the Emperour receiued the Clergie into his protection, and cited the Arch-biſhop, as hath beene ſaid.</p>
            <p>This newes comming to <hi>Trent,</hi> gaue matter to paſſe the time at the leaſt with diſcourſes. The Legates were much mooued, and amongſt the Prelates
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17208:72"/>
which were preſent thoſe that were of any vnderſtanding blamed the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for making himſelfe Iudge of faith and reformation; the moſt gentle word they ſpake was, that the Emperours proceeding was very ſcandalous. They began to know they were not eſteemed, and that to bee idle, was to be ſcorned by the world. Therefore they did diſcourſe that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned to declare themſelues to be a Councel lawfully called, and to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne <note place="margin">The Emperor is blamed, for the Citation, by the Fathers of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> the worke of God, proceeding firſt againſt the foreſayd Archbiſhop, the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Landgraue of <hi>Haſsia,</hi> and likewiſe againſt the King of <hi>England.</hi> They grew into ſo great ſpirits that they ſeemed not the ſame, who a few dayes before thought themſelues confined in priſon. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> abated this heat, putting them in minde of the greatneſſe of thoſe Princes and their adherents, and the danger to make them vnite themſelues with the King of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo to make a greater fire in <hi>Germanie:</hi> and the Cardinall of <hi>Trent</hi> ſpake in the ſame forme. The Italian Biſhops, thinking it a great matter to meddle in ſuch eminent ſubiects, ſaid it was true that all the world would be attentiue at ſuch a proceſſe, yet that all the importance was to begin and ground it well: They incited one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying it was neceſſary to redeeme the ſlowneſſe paſt with celerity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. That they ſhould demand of the Pope, ſome man of worth to pero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate againſt the accuſed, as did <hi>Melehior Baldaſsino,</hi> againſt the Pragmatique, in the <hi>Laterane</hi> Councel; beeing perſwaded that to depriue Princes of their States had no other difficultie, then to vſe well the formes of Proceſſes. But the Legates, as well for this as for other occurrences, knew it to be neceſſarie to haue ſuch a Doctor, and wrote to <hi>Rome</hi> to be prouided of one.</p>
            <p>The Pope vnderſtanding the Emperors action, was aſtoniſhed, and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">The Pope was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully distaſted with the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</note> whether to complaine or be ſilent. To complaine, when no effect would ſucceed he thought friuolous, and a demonſtration of his ſmall power. And this mooued him exceedingly. But on the other ſide, conſidering well how much it imported him not to paſſe ouer a matter of that moment, hee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not to giue words, as they did in <hi>Trent,</hi> but to proceed to facts, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the Emperour afterwards, if hee ſhould ſpeake of it. Therefore hee <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is cited by the Pope.</note> made another citation againſt the Archbiſhop, the eighteenth of Iuly, that within ſixtie dayes he ſhould appeare before him. Hee cited alſo the Deane of <hi>Collen,</hi> and fiue of the principall Canons, leauing the world to diſpute how the Archbiſhop could appeare before two which cited him for the ſame cauſe, in diuers places, at the ſame time, and how a diſpute of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petencie of the place of iudicature belonged to the honour of Chriſt. But how this ſucceeded, and what ende the cauſe had, ſhall bee ſaid in its place.</p>
            <p>To returne to that which more neerely concerneth the Councel, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour aſſayed in the Diet diuers wayes, to make the Proteſtants grant him <note place="margin">The Emperor demandeth aſſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turkes of the Proteſtants, who giue a conditionall anſwere.</note> aſſiſtance againſt the Turkes, not mentioning Religion. Whereunto they ſtill anſwered, that they could not reſolue without they were ſecured, that the peace ſhould be kept, and that, by the conuocation in <hi>Trent</hi> vnder the name of a Councell, it was not vnderſtood that the time of the peace was ended, according to the Decree of the former Diet, but declared that the peace cannot be interrupted, nor themſelues enforced by any Decrees made
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17208:73"/>
in <hi>Trent;</hi> becauſe they cannot ſubmit themſelues to that Councel, where the Pope, who hath condemned them already, hath free power. The Emperor ſayd, hee could not giue them peace which might exempt them from the Councel, to whoſe authority all are ſubiect that he had no way to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to other Kings and Princes, if it were granted to <hi>Germanie</hi> alone not to obey the Councell, aſſembled eſpecially for her ſake. But if, as they ſayd, they pretended a cauſe why they would not ſubmit, let them goe to the Councel, and alledge their reaſons why they ſuſpect it; that they ſhould be heard, and if it appeared they had wrong, they might then refuſe; that it was not pertinent to preuent, and to ſuſpect that which appeared not, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending grieuance of things to come, and iudging of that which is not ſeene as yet. They replyed, they ſpake not of things to come but paſt, their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion being condemned already, and perſecuted by the Pope and all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents. Therefore they were not to expect any future iudgement, becauſe it was paſt already. That it was iuſt that the Pope, and his adherents of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and of all other places, ſhould make one part in the Councell and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the other and for the difficulty about the manner and order of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the Emperour, Kings, and Princes ſhould bee Iudges, but for the merits of the cauſe, the Word of God onely.</p>
            <p>They could not be remooued from this reſolution, though the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of <hi>France,</hi> there preſent, did very much, and with menacing termes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat them to conſent to the Councel; which threats the Miniſters of that K. the Popes fauourers, did dictate to the Ambaſſadour, when hee parted from <hi>France.</hi> The Imperialiſts propoſed the tranſlation of the Councel into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> vnder the Emperors promiſe to labour effectually, that the Pope ſhould condeſcend; which the others accepted, vpon condition the peace were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed vntill the Councel were aſſembled there. But <hi>Charles,</hi> being ſure that the Pope would neuer agree, ſaw that this was to giue them a perpetual peace, and therefore he thought it better to leaue things in ſuſpence, granting it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vntill another Diet, ſeeing hee was conſtrayned, hauing not concluded truce with the Turkes as yet, and eſteeming more that warre; thinking that by occaſion of a Colloquie, other reaſonable meanes would bee offered hereafter; to make them conſent anew to the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> or, in caſe of refuſall, to hold them contumacious, and to make warre againſt them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fourth of Auguſt hee ended the Diet, and ordained another in <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tubon,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Another Diet is ordained in <hi>Ratubon</hi> for Ianuary.</note> for Ianuary next, whereat the Princes ſhould be perſonally preſent, and inſtituted a Colloquie in matter of Religion, of foure Doctors, and two Iudges for a ſide. This was to begin at December, that the matter might be digeſted before the Diet. Hee confirmed and renewed the former Edicts of peace, and ſet downe a manner to pay the contributions for the war. How the Colloquie did proceede, ſhall be ſaid in its place.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants, being departed from <hi>Wormes,</hi> ſet forth a booke, where <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt the Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine councel.</note> they ſaid in ſumme, that they eſteemed not the Tridentine for a Councell, being not aſſembled in <hi>Germanie,</hi> as <hi>Adrian</hi> and the Emperour promiſed; whereunto to make ſhew of giuing ſatisfaction by making choice of <hi>Trent,</hi> was to mocke the world, becauſe <hi>Trent</hi> cannot bee ſaid to bee in <hi>Germanie,</hi> but onely becauſe the Biſhop is a Prince of the Empire: but for ſecuritie, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17208:73"/>
it was aswell in <hi>Italie,</hi> and as much in the Popes power as <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe. And the rather they eſteemed it not lawfull, becauſe Pope, <hi>Paul</hi> would bee preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in it, and propoſe by his Legats; that the Iudges were tyed vnto him by oath; that the plea being againſt the Pope, himſelfe ought not to be Iudge; that it was neceſſarie to treat firſt of the forme of the Councell, and of the authorities, whereupon to ground. But the Emperours reſolution diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">The Emperor is taxed againe for medling in Religion.</note> alike in <hi>Trent</hi> and at <hi>Rome,</hi> as well becauſe a ſecular Prince medled in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as becauſe, it ſeemed the Councell was caſſeered, in regard, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, order was giuen to handle elſe-where the controuerſies of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. The Prelats in <hi>Trent</hi> blamed the Decree, as it were with one voyce, ſaying it was worſe then that of <hi>Spira,</hi> and maruelling that the Pope, who ſhewed himſelfe ſo quicke againſt that, had and did tolarate this, after that the Councell was intimated, and already aſſembled. From this they drew a manifeſt Argument, that their remaining in <hi>Trent</hi> was vaine and diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. The Legats tryed their wits to conſolate, and perſwade them, that all <note place="margin">The Prelats in <hi>Trent</hi> are diſcontented, and moſt of them doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</note> had beene permitted by his Holineſſe for a good end. But they replyed, that whatſoeuer the end was, and what thing ſoeuer doth follow, the blemiſh, not onely of the Pope and Apoſtolique Sea, but of the Councell and the whole Church will neuer be taken away. Neither could the Legats reſiſt their complaints, which ended in demanding leaue to depart, ſome alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging neceſſary and important affaires of their own, and ſome to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into ſome of the next cities for infirmitie or indiſpoſition. And though the Legats gaue leaue to none, yet ſome of them dayly tooke it, ſo that before the end of the moneth, there remained very few. But in <hi>Rome,</hi> though this ſucceſſe was foreſeene by the negotiation of Cardinall <hi>Farneſe,</hi> yet after it happened they began to thinke more exactly of it. They conſidered that the Emperors ends were much different from the Popes; for he, holding things in ſuſpence, diſpatched his buſineſſe well in <hi>Germany,</hi> giuing the Proteſtants <note place="margin">The Emperor deſireth to hold the Councell in ſuſpence.</note> hope, that if they pleaſed him, he would not ſuffer the Councell to bee ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and putting them in feare, that in caſe they did not, it ſhould begin and proceed againſt them. Therefore he euer cauſed ſome new emergents to ariſe, which might hold things in ſuſpence, paſſing the time pleaſantly vnder diuers colours, and ſometimes alſo propoſing that it were better to transferre it to another place, giuing hope hee could bee contented it were tranſlated into <hi>Italie,</hi> euen vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope and the Prelates of that Nation might more eaſily hearken to the propoſition, and draw the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in length.</p>
            <p>The Pope was in great ſtraits. Sometimes hee had the ancient deſire <note place="margin">The Pope is doubtfull what courſe to take.</note> of his predeceſſors that the Councell ſhould not be celebrated, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe for hauing proceeded ſo farre, yet hee ſaw that it was ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and dangerous to him, to ſhew openly that hee would not haue it, by diſſoluing that ſmall congregation which remained in <hi>Trent.</hi> He ſaw cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it was not a good remedie to extinguiſh hereſies. For concerning that which belonged to <hi>Italie,</hi> it was better to prouide againſt it by force, and by the office of the Inquiſition, whereas the expectation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell hindereth that which is the onely remedie. For <hi>Germany,</hi> it appeared plainely that the Councell did rather make difficult, then facilitate thoſe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17208:74"/>
things. Beſides; in eaſe it were celebrated, hee doubted whether hee ſhould grant the Emperour the halfe fruits and vaſſalages of the Moneſtaries in <hi>Spaine.</hi> For if hee did not, his Maieſtie would bee angry, and if hee did it, hee doubted that the Spaniſh Prelates would diſcouer in the Councell that they were alienated from him and the Apoſtolike Sea, for giuing that to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which belonged to them. He ſaw likewiſe that the Prelates of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome were if ſatiſfied, who would think it intolerable to pay the tenths, and be at charges in the Councel. Hee thought that thoſe of <hi>France</hi> would ioyne with them; and incourage them, not for charitie, but to hinder the Emperors profit. Therefore he began to incline to the tranſlation, ſo that it were not caried further into <hi>Germany,</hi> as was treated of in <hi>Wormes,</hi> whereunto he ſayd he would neuer conſent, though hee had an 100. hoſtages, and as many pawnes: and the rather becauſe by tranſferring it more into <hi>Italy,</hi> into a place more fertil, commodious and ſecure, he thought he auoyded the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of continuing in that ſtate, and letting the Councell lie at anchor, and be drawen in length from ſeaſon to ſeaſon; the worſt reſolution that could be made, for infinite and perpetuall preiudices which might inſue. Beſides, by the time which the tranſlation required, the preſent miſchiefe was cured, which was to haue Councell, and a Colloquie, and Diet inſtituted for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion concurre together, not knowing what end the one or the other might haue; a thing diſhonourable, and dangerous, and of bad example; and the Prelats would be ſatiſfied by parting from <hi>Trent.</hi> Beeing thus reſolued, that <note place="margin">The Bull of tranſlation.</note> he might be prouided to put it fitly in execution, he ſent to the Legates the Bull of faculty to tranſlate it, dated February 22. of which it hath beene ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before.</p>
            <p>Theſe thoughts did not poſſeſſe either the whole, or the principall part of the Popes mind, but he thought much more of infeoffing his ſon in <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> which he had imparted to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> &amp; did effect it in the end of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, <note place="margin">There is much mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring at the donation of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza</hi> to a baſtard.</note> not reſpecting the generall murmuring, that, while the Clergie was to bee reformed, the head of it ſhould beſtow principalities vpon a ſonne of a damned coniunction. This the whole Colledge tooke ill, though onely <hi>Iohn Dominicus de Cupis,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Trani,</hi> with ſome few more, oppoſed it; <hi>Iohn <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ega,</hi> the Emperours Ambaſſador, refuſed to bee preſent, and <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> his nephewes wife, ſhewed herſelfe diſcontented, becauſe ſhee deſired the inueſtiture in the perſon of her husband, for that ſhee loſt the title of the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Camerino,</hi> and got nothing, Afterwards, beeing wholly imployed in freeing himſelfe from the difficulties and dangers which the Councell brought with it ſtanding thus, neither opened nor ſhut, but ſo as it might ſerue the Emperours turne againſt him, hee reſolued to ſend the Biſhop of <hi>Caſerta</hi> to treate with his Maieſtie, propoſing either to <note place="margin">The Pope ſendeth a Nuncio to the Emperor.</note> haue it opened and begunne, or ſuſpended for a time, and in caſe that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not, he was to propoſe the tranſlation of it into <hi>Italy,</hi> to giue conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time to what ſhould be handled in the Colloquie and Diet, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther match, which were not ſodiſhonourable and dangerous for the Church, as to haue the Councell remaining ſtill on foote, and the Legates and Prelats idle.</p>
            <p>This negotiation had many rubs. For the Emperour was reſolute, not to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17208:74"/>
conſent either to ſuſpenſion or tranſlation; not holding it good for his ends to begin it, he did not abſolutely denie any of the things propoſed; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other courſe to take, he knew not what to do, but to interpoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to the three propoſitions. Finally, in the middeſt of October, hee found out a temper, that the Councell ſhould bee opened, and the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion treated of, forbearing to ſpeake of hereſies and points of doctrine, leſt they ſhould prouoke the Proteſtants. The Pope aduiſed heereof by the <note place="margin">The Pope is much often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Emperours anſwere.</note> 
               <hi>Nuncio</hi> his letters, was touched at the very heart. For hee ſaw plainely that this was to giue the victorie into the hands of the Lutherans, and to robbe himſelfe of all authoritie, making him depend of Colloquies and Imperiall Diets, ordaining in them treaties of religion, and forbidding the Councell tomeddle with them, and ſo to weaken him by alienating his dependants, and to ſtrengthen the Lutherans, by ſupporting, or not condemning their hereſies. And beeing aſſured that his and the Emperours intereſts were ſo contarie, as that they could not be vnited, he reſolued to conceale his owne ends, and to proceede as beſt befitted his affaires. Therefore, without ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any diſtaſte of the anſwere, he preſently replyed to <hi>Caſerta,</hi> that, for his Maieſties ſake, hee reſolued to open the Councell immediately, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the acts thereof ſhould begin, and all ſhould proceed with full libertie, and in fit manner and order. This the Pope ſayd in ſuch generall termes, becauſe he would not expreſſe himſelfe, what ſhould bee firſt, or what laſt, or what treated of, or What wholly left out. For hee was reſolute to handle the matter of religion and points of doctrine principally, without alleadging other reaſon, incaſe he ſhould bee conſtrained to alleadge any, but that to treat of reformation onely, was a thing neuer vſed before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the reputation both of himſelfe and of the Councell. Therefore, the laſt of October, hauing imparted all to the Cardinals, by their counſell and aduiſe, he ordained, and wrote alſo to <hi>Trent,</hi> that the Synode ſhould be opened the next Sunday, called <hi>Gaudete</hi> in Aduent, which was to bee the 13. <note place="margin">He giueth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to begin the Councell the 13. of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</note> of December.</p>
            <p>The Prelats ſhewed great ioy for the newes, ſeeing themſelues deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the imminent danger, to remaine long in <hi>Trent,</hi> and doe nothing. But a little after the ambiguities were on foot againe. For letters came from <note place="margin">The 3. Fren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Prelats are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, but two of them are perſwaded to remaine.</note> the French King to his Prelates, which were three, that they ſhould depart. This ſeemed to the Legates a thing of the greateſt importance, being as it were a declaration. that <hi>France</hi> and the King approoued not the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. They vſed all meanes to hinder their departure, telling the Prelates, that the King gaue that order when the caſe was otherwiſe, and that they ought to expect another, becauſe his Maieſtie was now informed of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, putting them in minde of the ſcandall that would enſue, in caſe they did otherwiſe, and of the offence which other Nations would take. The Cardinall of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Spaniſh and Italian Prelats proteſted againſt their departure. Therefore in concluſion they tooke a middle courſe, which the King commended when he knew it, that the Lord of <hi>Renes</hi> ſhould goe to giue the King account, and the other two remaine.</p>
            <p>The laſt of Nouember, the time prefixed for the opening of the Councel approaching, the Legates wrote to <hi>Rome,</hi> that, to preſerue the authority of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17208:75"/>
the Apoſtolique Sea, it were fit, in opening of it, to read and regiſter a Bull, which might command it to bee done; and they made a diſpatch in all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that it might come in time. The anſwere, together with the Bull, arriued the eleuenth of December. Therefore the Legates commanded a faſt and Proceſſion the next day, and made a Congregation of all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, where firſt the bull was read, and then all treated of, which was to bee done the next day, in the Seſſion. The Biſhop of <hi>Eſtorga</hi> propoſed after a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing manner, that it was neceſſary to read in the Congregation the Briefe of the Legation and Preſidencie, that all might make profeſſion of their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſubiection to the Apoſtolique Sea. The requeſt was approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">The Legates would not ſuffer the Bull of their Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bee read.</note> by almoſt all the Congregation, and accompanied with the particular inſtance of euery one. But the Legate <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> conſidering how farre the demand might reach, and that to publiſh the authoritie of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, might breede danger to haue it limited, thinking it better by keeping it ſecret, to vſe it as occaſion ſerued, anſwered readily, that in the Councell all were but one bodie, and that it was equally neceſſarie to reade the Buls of euery Biſhop, to ſhew hee was ſuch a one, inſtituted by the Apoſtolique Sea; which would be tedious, and, by reaſon of thoſe who dayly will come, would ſpend the time of all the Congregations, and ſo hee ſtopped the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and retained the dignitie of the Legation, which conſiſted in beeing vnlimited.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth of December came at laſt, when in <hi>Rome</hi> the Pope publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a Bull of Iubilie, where hee declared that hee had intimated a Councel <note place="margin">The Councel is opened in <hi>Trent,</hi> and a Iubilie publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> to heale the wounds of the Church, cauſed by impious heretikes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee exhorted euery one to aſſiſt the Fathers aſſembled therein, with their prayers to God: which to doe effectually and fruitfully, they ought to confeſſe themſelues, and faſt three dayes, and during that time, to goe in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, and then to receiue the moſt bleſſed Sacrament; granting pardon of all his ſinnes to whoſoeuer did ſo. The ſame day the Legates in <hi>Trent,</hi> with all the Prelates, in number 25. in pontifical habit, accompanied With the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, Clergie and people of forreine parts, and of the City, made a ſolemne proceſſion, from <hi>Trinitie</hi> Church to the Cathedrall; where <hi>Monte,</hi> the <note place="margin">The Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies vſed.</note> prime Legate, did ſing the Maſſe of the holy Ghoſt, in which the Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto</hi> made a long copious eloquent Sermon. That being ended, the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats cauſed a long written admonition to be read, the ſumme whereof was: that it was their charge during the whole courſe of the councel, to admoniſh the Prelats in occurrences, and that it was fit to begin in that Seſſion, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <note place="margin">The admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Card. <hi>Monte.</hi>
               </note> that this admonition &amp; all the reſt, were as wel made to themſelues as to others as being of the ſame condition, with them that the Councel was aſſembled for three cauſes; for the extirpation of hereſie, reſtitution of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical diſcipline, and regaining of peace. To execute which things it was fit to haue firſt a true &amp; inward ſenſe, what it was to be the cauſe of all thoſe three calamities. Of hereſies, not that they had raiſed them, but that they had not performed their duetie in ſowing good doctrine, and rooting out the cockle. Of manners corrupted that there was no neede to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it beeing manifeſt, that the Clergie and Paſtours onely were corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and corrupted. For which things God had alſo ſent the third plague,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17208:75"/>
which was the war, forraine of the Turkes and ciuill of the Chriſtians. That without this inward and true acknowledgement, their enterance into the Councell, and calling vpon the holy Ghoſt were in vaine. That the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God was iuſt to puniſh them ſo deepely, though it were leſſe then they deſerued. Therefore they exhorted euery one to know his owne faults, to mitigate the wrath of God, replying that the holy Ghoſt, which they had inuocated, would not come, if they refuſed to heare of their owne ſinnes, and like <hi>Eſdras, Nehemiab,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> confeſſe them. He added that it was a great bleſſing of God, that there was ſuch an occaſion giuen to beginne a Councel, for reformation on all hands. And though contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors will not bee wanting, yet it was their duetie conſtantly to goe on, and, as Iudges, to auoyde paſſion, and aime onely at the glory of God, in regard they are to performe this duety before him, the Angels, and the whole Church. In fine, they admoniſhed the Biſhops ſent by the Princes, to doe their Maſters ſeruice with faith and diligence; yet preferring the honour of God before all. Afterwards the Bull of the intimation of the Councel in the yeere 1542. was read, and a Briefe of the ſimple deputation of the Legates, together with a Bull of the opening of the Councel; and immediately <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſo Zorilla,</hi> Secretarie to <hi>Don Diego,</hi> ſtepped forward, and reproduced the Emperours Commiſſion preſented before to the Legates, and ſhewed a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Don Diego,</hi> in which he excuſed his abſence, by reaſon of his indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. For his excuſe the Legates ſayd it was worthy to bee admitted. For the Commiſſion, though they might inſiſt vpon the anſwere giuen before, yet they were pleaſed for greater reuerence to receiue it againe, and examine it, and make anſwere afterwards.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being done, according to the rite of the Roman Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, all kneeled downe to pray ſoftly, as the vſe was in all the Seſſions, and then they ſayd aloud, <hi>Adſumus Domine, &amp;c. Sancte Spiritus, &amp;c.</hi> Which the Preſident ſpake with an high voice, in the name of all. The Letanie being ſung, the Goſpel was read by the Deacon, <hi>Si peccauerit in te frater tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, &amp;c.</hi> And laſtly the hymne, <hi>Veni Creator ſpiritus,</hi> beeing ſung, and all ſate downe in their places, the Cardinall of <hi>Monte</hi> pronunced the Decree, with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatorie words; reading, whether it pleaſed the Fathers, for the praiſe of God, extirpation of hereſies, reformation of Church and people, depreſſion of the enemies of Chriſt, to determine and declare that the holy Tridentine and Generall Councel ſhould begin, and be begun; whereunto all anſwered, firſt the Legates, then the Biſhops, and other Fathers by the word <hi>Place<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> He then added, whether in regard of the Feaſts of the old and new yeere, it <note place="margin">The decree for opening the Councels and holden the next Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> pleaſed them that the next Seſſion ſhould be the ſeuenth of Ianuary; and they anſwered likewiſe that it pleaſed them. This being done, <hi>Hercules Seuerallo,</hi> Speaker of the Councel, deſired the Notaries to make an inſtrument of all. The himne, <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> was ſung, and the Fathers putting off their Pontificall habits, and putting on their common, accompanied the Legates, the Croſſe going before. Theſe ceremonies being vſed in the Seſſions fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, ſhall be repeated no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> were very curious to know the firſt actions of this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, which was begun with ſo many difficulties, &amp; the Prelats in <hi>Trent,</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:17208:76"/>
and thoſe of their family, were charged by their friends to aduiſe them of it. Therefore immediatly after the Seſſion, a copie of the Legats admonition, and of the oration of <hi>Bitonto</hi> was ſent into euery place; which were quickly printed. Whereof that I may the better tell what was commonly ſpoken, it is neceſſarie to relate briefely the contents of the Oration. It began with ſhewing the neceſſitie of the Councell, becauſe it is an hundred yeeres ſince that of <hi>Florence,</hi> and becauſe things of difficultie belonging to the Church, <note place="margin">The contents of the orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made by the Biſhop of <hi>Ritonto.</hi>
               </note> cannot well be handled but in it. For in them the Creeds haue beene made, hereſies condemned, manners amended, Chriſtian Nations vnited, armies ſent to conquer the holy land, Kings and Emperours depoſed, and ſchiſmes rooted out. And that for this cauſe the Poets introduce the Councell of the Gods. And <hi>Moyſes</hi> writeth that they were conciliarie voyces, the Decree to make man, and to confound the tongues of the Giants. That Religion hath three heads, Doctrine, the Sacraments, and Charitie; and that all theſe three call for a Councell. Hee declared the corruptions entred into them, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of which, the Pope, by the fauour of the Emperour, Kings of <hi>France,</hi> of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and of Chriſtian Princes, hath aſſembled the Synod, and ſent his Legats. He made a long digreſſion in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Pope, and another, not much ſhorter in praiſe of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour; then he praiſed the three Legats, deriuing their commendation from the name and ſurname of each of them; and added that the Councel being aſſembled, all ought to meet in it, as in the <hi>Troian</hi> horſe. Hee inuited the woods of <hi>Trent,</hi> to ſound foorth through the world, that all ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to that Councel; which if they doe not, it will be iuſtly ſayd, that the Popes light is come into the world, and men haue loued darkneſſe better then the light. He lamented that the Emperour was not preſent, or, at the leaſt <hi>Don Diego,</hi> who repreſented him. He congratulated the Cardinall <hi>Madruccio,</hi> that the Pope had aſſembled in his City the diſperſed and wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fathers. Hee turned to the Prelats, and ſayd, that to open the gates of the Councel, was to open the gates of Paradiſe from whence would deſcend liuing water to fill the earth with the knowledge of the Lord. Hee exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fathers to amendment, and to open their hearts, as dry ground, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it; adding, that if they doe it not, yet the holy Ghoſt will open their mouths, though their mindes bee poſſeſſed with an euill ſpirit, as hee did the mouths of <hi>Caiphas</hi> and <hi>Balaam,</hi> leſt, if the Councel ſhould erre, the Church ſhould erre alſo. Hee exhorted them to lay aſide all paſſion, that they may truely ſay, It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and to vs. Hee inuited <hi>Greece, France, Spaine, Italy,</hi> and all Chriſtian Nations to the Marriage. In fine, hee turned himſelfe to Chriſt, praying him, by the interceſſion of Saint <hi>Vigilius,</hi> (the turelarie Saint of the valley of <hi>Trent)</hi> to aſſiſt that Councell.</p>
            <p>The Legats admonition was accounted pious, Chriſtian, modeſt, and <note place="margin">The cenſure of the oration.</note> worthy of Cardinals, but the Sermon of the Biſhop was iudged farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. His vanitie and oſtentation of Eloquence was noted by all. But men of vnderſtanding compared, as an holy ſentence to a wicked, thoſe ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and moſt true words of the Legats, that without a good inward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, the holy Ghoſt would in vaine be called on, with the ſaying of the Biſhop quite contrary, that, without that, their mouth ſhould bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17208:76"/>
by the holy Ghoſt, though their heart remained repleniſhed with a wicked ſpirit. It was thought arrogancy to affirme, that, in caſe thoſe few Prelates erred all the Church would erre; as if other Councels of ſeuen hundred Biſhops had not erred, and the Church refuſed their doctrine. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers added that this was not conformable to the doctrine of the Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, who grant not infallibilitie but to the Pope, and to the Councell by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Popes confirmation. But to compare the Councell to the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian horſe, an inſidious inuention, was noted of folly, and reprehended for irreuerence. To haue retorted the words of the Scripture, that Chriſt and his doctrine, the light of the Father is come into the world, and men haue preferred darkneſſe before the light, making the Councell and doctrine thereof, to bee the Popes light, appeared to the world, which if it were not receiued, it ſhould be ſaid, men haue loued darkeneſſe more then light, was eſteemed a blaſphemie, and it was wiſhed that at the leaſt hee had not taken the formall words of the holy Scripture, that hee might not haue ſhewed ſo openly to haue diſeſteemed it.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Trent,</hi> the beginning being made, neither the Prelates, not Legats <note place="margin">The Legates not knowing how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, write to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> themſelues knew what ſhould bee handled, nor what order obſerued. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Legates wrote to <hi>Rome</hi> a letter, worthie to bee repeated at large, to giue an account of what was done before. Firſt they ſaid they bee appointed the next ſeſſion the day after the Epiphanie, as a terme which could not bee taxed neither of too long delay, nor too much breuitie, that in the meane time they might be aduiſed how to gouerne themſelues in the other ſeſſions, wherein they deſire to haue light; and becauſe they might euery houre be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated of diuers things, for which they could not haue ſpace to aduiſe and expect an anſwere, they deſired that as particular an inſtruction, as was poſſible, ſhould be ſent them. Aboue all they deſired aduertiſement concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the manner and forme to proceede, to propoſe, to reſolue, and what matter ſhould be handled. They demanded eſpecially if the cauſe of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſhould be the firſt, or ſhould be treated of in generall, or in particular, condemning the falſe doctrine, or the perſons of the principall heretikes, or the one and the other together: if the Prelates propoſe an Article of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, where at all ſeeme to ayme, whether it ſhould bee handled together with the Article of Religion, or before or after: if the Councell ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate its beginning to all people and nations, inuiting the Prelats and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and exhorting the faithfull to pray God for it; or if his Holineſſe will doe it himſelfe; when there ſhall be occaſion to write ſome letter, miſſiue or reſponſiue, what forme is to be vſed and what Seale; likewiſe what forme is to bee vſed in the extention of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

that ſome had a deſigne to diſpute of the authority of the Councell, and Pope; a thing dangerous to raiſe a ſchiſme amongſt the Catholikes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; and that in the congregation of the 12. all the Prelats ioyntly and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired to ſee the commiſſion of their facultie, which they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained artificially to auoide, not knowing as yet how their preſidencie ought to be vnderſtood and how farre his Holineſſe would haue it extended. They demanded alſo that order might be taken for the rodes, that euery day and houre they might ſend and receiue aduiſe, as occaſion ſerued; they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome order about the precedencie of Ambaſſadors of the Princes, and prouiſion of money, in regard thoſe 2000. crownes, ſent them a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were ſpent vpon ſome poore Biſhops.</p>
            <p>The Prelates were earneſt that the worke might beginne; wherefore the Legates to giue them ſome ſatisfaction, and to ſhew they were not idle, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a congregation the 18. day, without propoſing any thing but the manner of liuing, and conuerſing, and gouerning their families. Much was ſaide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vſe brought in, eſpecially in <hi>Rome,</hi> to weare the habit of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in the ceremonie onely, and at other times of a ſecular. Sumptuous apparrell, as alſo baſe and ſordide, were equally reprehended: and much was ſaide of the age of their ſeruants, but all was referred to bee reſolued in another congregation, which was held the two and twentieth, and was wholly ſpent in diſcourſing vpon ſuch ceremonies, concluding that a good reformation of the minde was principally neceſſary: wherefore ayming at the ſeemelineſſe which belongeth to their degree, and edification of the people, euery one will ſee what hee hath to redreſſe in himſelfe, and his familie.</p>
            <p>The Pope, vnderſtanding the Councell was begun, deputed a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cardinals and Courtiers to ſuperintend, and aduiſe concerning the affaires of <hi>Trent.</hi> Conſulting with theſe, hee reſolued that things were not as yet ripe enough to ſee cleerely what matters were to bee handled, and in what order. Hee cauſed an anſwere to bee ſent to the Legates that it beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">The Popes anſwere.</note> not the Synode to inuite either Princes or Prelates, and leaſt of all to deſire any one to aſſiſt them with prayers, becauſe this hee had ſufficiently done himſelfe by the Bull of the Iubile, and that by the Letters for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of the Councell: that they ought not to thinke that the Synod ſhould write to any, the Legats hauing power to ſupply that, by their owne letters written in all their names. Concerning the extenſion of the Decrees, the title ought to be. The moſt holy Oecumenicall and generall Synode of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Apoſtolicall Legats being Preſidents. But for the forme of giuing voyces, that their reaſons were very good not to doe it by nations; the rather becauſe it was neuer vſed in ancient times, but was introduced by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and followed by that of <hi>Baſill;</hi> which are not to be imitated. But the forme vſed in the laſt <hi>Later as</hi> Councel being the beſt and moſt decent, they ſhould follow that, by which late example, which ſucceeded well, they might ſtop the mouth of whoſoeuer propoſed any to the contrary. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the condemnation of the heretikes, &amp; matters to be handled, &amp; other things demanded by them, order ſhould be giuen in time conuenient: in the mean ſpace they ſhould ſpend the time inprea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bulary things, according to the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17208:77"/>
cuſtome of other Councels. That they ſhould maintaine their preſidencie with that comlineſſe that beſeemeth the Legats of the Apoſtolike Sea, yet ſo as that they may giue ſatisfaction vnto all; but, aboue all, ſhould vſe diligence that the Prelats ſhould not exceed the bounds of honeſt liberty, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards the Apoſtolike Sea. It was a matter of greater importance to aſſiſt the Prelates that they might bee able to maintaine themſelues. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſent a Briefe, by which hee exempted all the Prelates of the Councell from payment of Tenths, and granted them the participation of all fruits, as well in abſence as preſence: he ſent alſo two thouſand crownes to helpe the needie Biſhops, giuing order they ſhould not care to haue it publiſhed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in caſe it were knowen, it could not bee expounded but for a louing courteſie of the head of the Councell.</p>
            <p>This place requireth, by reaſon of that which hath been, and will be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">The manner of giuing voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Councell in all ages.</note> in diuers occaſions, about the manner of ſpeaking their opinions in the Councel called, <hi>Giuing of voyces,</hi> that it ſhould be declared, what the cuſtome was of old, &amp; how this, which is vſed in theſe times, came firſt vp. The aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of a whole Church, to handle in the Name of God the occurrences of doctrine and diſcipline, is a thing moſt profitable, vſed by the holy Apoſtles in the choyce of <hi>Matthias,</hi> and the ſeuen Deacons: and the Dioceſan Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels are much like to this. But of the meeting of Chriſtians from many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote places to conſult together, there is a famous example in the Acts of the Apoſtles, when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> with others of <hi>Syria,</hi> met the Apoſtles and other diſciples in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> who were aſſembled about the queſtion of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the Law. And though it may bee ſaid that it was a recourſe of the new Churches of the Gentiles, vnto the old mother Church, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence their faith was deriued, a cuſtom much vſed in thoſe firſt ages, &amp; often rehearſed by <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> &amp; though the letter were written by the Apoſtles, Elders, &amp; brethren of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> only, yet in regard that not they only, but <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> alſo did ſpeake, it may well be called a Councel; by example whereof the ſucceeding Biſhops thought all Chriſtian Churches to bee but one, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all Biſhoprickes to be but onely one, ſo framed, that euery Biſhop held a part thereof, not as his owne, but ſo, as that all ought to gouerne the whole, and euery one to employ himſelfe moſt in that which was particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him; as <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> in his little golden booke of the vnity of the Church, doth piouſly demonſtrate. In caſe of neceſſity of any particular Church, though the perſecutions ſometimes waxed warme, as many as could aſſembled themſelues, to make prouiſion in common. In which aſſemblies CHRIST and the holy Ghoſt being preſident, and charity chaſing away all humane paſſion, they aduiſed and reſolued of what was fit, without ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or formes preſcribed. But after a certaine time, paſſions of men and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie beeing mingled together, and there beeing a neceſſity to gouerne them with ſome order, the chiefeſt man amongſt thoſe that were aſſembled in Councell, either for learning, or for greatneſſe of the Citie or Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was, or for ſome other reſpect of eminencie, tooke vpon him the charge to propoſe and guide the action, and collect the voyces. But after that it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to giue peace to the Chriſtians, and that the Romane Emperours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the holy faith, there happening more difficulties in doctrine and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17208:78"/>
which, by reaſon of the ambition or other bad affections of thoſe that had followers and credite, troubled the publike quiet another ſort of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal aſſemblies had beginning, congregated by Princes or their Lieutenants, to remedie the troubles. In theſe the action was guided by thoſe Princes or Magiſtrates which did call them together, who alſo were perſonally preſent, propoſing and gouerning the treatie, and decreeing interlocutorily, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring differences, but leauing the deciſion of the principall point, for which the Councell was congregated, to the common opinion of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie. This forme appeareth in the Councels, whoſe actes doe remaine. The Colloquie of Catholikes and Donatiſtes before <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and many others may ſerue for example. But to ſpeake onely of generall Councels, this was done in the firſt Councel of <hi>Epheſus</hi> before the Earle <hi>Candidianus,</hi> ſent Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the Emperour; and more cleerely in that of <hi>Calcedon</hi> before <hi>Martia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and the Iudges by him appointed, in that of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Trullo</hi> before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Poganatus,</hi> where the Prince or Magiſtrate that was Preſident, commanded what ſhould bee handled, what order obſerued, who ſhould ſpeake, and who be ſilent, and did decide and accommodate the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in theſe things. And in the other generall Councell, the actes whereof are not extant, as of the firſt of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the ſecond of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the hiſtorians of that Age doe witneſſe, that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Theodofius</hi> did the like. Yet in thoſe times, when the Biſhops themſelues did aſſemble of their owne accord and others medled not, the action was gouerned as hath been ſaid, by one of them, and the reſolution taken according to the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Sometimes the matter was ſo eaſie, that it was diſpatched in one mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Sometimes, by reaſon of the difficulty or multiplicitie thereof, it was neceſſarie to reiterate the buſineſſe, whence proceeded the many Seſſions in the ſame Councel. Not one of them was about ceremony, or only to publiſh what was digeſted elſewhere, but to vnderſtand the opinion of euery one, and the colloquies, diſcuſſions, diſputes, and whatſoeuer was done or ſpoken, were called the actes of the Councel. It is a new opinion, and ſeldome practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, though eſtabliſhed in <hi>Trent,</hi> that the Decrees onely are called Actes of the Councel, and ought onely to bee publiſhed; but in the ancient Councels all was giuen vnto all. Notaries were preſent to collect the voyces, who, when a Biſhop ſpake and was not contradicted, wrote not his proper name, but thus, The Holy Sinode ſaith. And when many ſaid the ſame thing, it was written, The Biſhops acclaymed, or affirmed, and the things ſo ſpoken were taken for deciſions; if they ſpake in a contrary ſenſe, the contrary opinions were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the names of the authours, and the Iudges or Preſidents did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce. Sometimes ſome impertinencie did vndoubtedly happen by reaſon of ſome mans imperfection; but charitie, which excuſeth the defects of ones brother, did couer it. A greater number of the Prouince, where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was held, and of the borders was preſent; but without emulation, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one rather deſiring to obey, then to giue a law vnto others. After the Eaſterne and Weſterne Empires were ſeparated, there remained ſtill in the Weſt ſome marke of the ancient Councels, and many were celebrated in <note place="margin">Councels go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by Princes.</note> 
               <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> vnder the poſterity of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and not a few in <hi>Spaine,</hi> vnder the Kings of the <hi>Gothes.</hi> At laſt, Princes being abſolutely debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17208:78"/>
to intermeddle in Eccleſiaſtical matters, that kind of Councel grew in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, <note place="margin">1546 PAVL 3. CHARLES 5.—HENRY 8. FRANCIS 1.</note> &amp; that alone remained which was called by the Eccleſiaſtikes themſelues; the conuocation of which Prouinciall Councels was almoſt wholly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Pope, by ſending his Legates to bee Preſidents, whereſoeuer hee heard there was a treatie to hold a Councell. And after a certaine time hee tooke that power to himſelfe which the Romane Emperours vſed, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate a Councell of the whole Empire, and to be Preſident himſelfe, if hee were preſent, or, in his abſence, to ſend Legates to be Preſidents; and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the action. But the Prelats, aſſembled in the Synod, being deliuered from the feare of a Secular Prince, which kept them in awe, as worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, the cauſes of all miſchiefes, did exceedingly increaſe, which cauſed alſo the multiplying of many indecencies, they beganne to digeſt and order the matters in priuate, that they might obſerue a decencie in the publike meeting. Afterwards this was obſerued for a forme, and in the Councels, beſides the Seſſions, they beganne to make Congregations of ſome Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to ſet in order the matters to bee treated of, which in the beginning, if they were many, were diuided, and a proper Congregation aſſigned to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. And this beeing not ſufficient to remooue all the indecencies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe that were not preſent, hauing different intereſts, made difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in publique, beſides the particular Congregation, they made a generall before the Seſſion, where all were preſent; which according to the ancient rite, is the Conciliarie action, becauſe the Seſſion, euery thing being done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, remayneth but a pure ceremonie. But a little more then one Age being paſt, priuate intereſts cauſed a contention to ariſe amongſt the Biſhops of diuers Nations. Whereupon thoſe that were remote beeing few, and not willing to bee ouercome by the borderers, who were more in number, to make the ballance equall, it was neceſſary that euery Nation ſhould aſſemble by it ſelfe, and reſolue according to the number of voices, and that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deciſion ſhould be eſtabliſhed, not by the ſuffrages of particular men, but by the plurality of the voyces of the Nations. So it was obſerued in the Councels of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Baſil:</hi> which vſe as it was good where the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment was free, as it was when the world had no Pope, ſo it ill befitted <note place="margin">Why the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts made ſo great a matter of the forme of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</note> 
               <hi>Trent,</hi> where they deſired a Councell ſubiect vnto him. And this was the reaſon, why the Legates at <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> made ſo great a matter of the forme of proceeding, and of the quality and authority of the Preſidencie.</p>
            <p>But the anſwere being come from <hi>Rome,</hi> they called the Congregation the fifth of Ianuary 1546. where the Cardinall of <hi>Monte</hi> hauing ſaluted and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">1546</note> them all in the Popes name, cauſed the ſaid Briefe of exemption from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tenthes to be read. The three Legates made as it were three enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miaſticall Orations, one after another, declaring the Popes good affection towards the Fathers. But ſome Spaniards ſaide that this fauour of the Pope brought greater dammage then benefit, becauſe the accepting of it implied a confeſſion that the Pope might lay burthens vpon other Churches, and that the Councell had not authority to hinder him, nor to exempt thoſe who by right were not to be included. The Legates were not only diſpleaſed at this, but returned alſo ſome biting termes. Some of the Prelates demanded that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17208:79"/>
the grace might bee extended to thoſe of their families alſo, and to as many as were preſent in the Councel. The Generals of the religious Orders deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded likewiſe the ſame exemption, alledging the charge of the Monaſteries for the Friars which they brought to the Councel. <hi>Catalanus Triultius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> who arriued two dayes before, related publikely that hee was rifled as he paſſed neere to <hi>Mirandula,</hi> and deſired an order ſhould be made in the Councel againſt thoſe that hindered or moleſted the Prelates, or others that went to the Councel. The Legates, ioyning this propoſe with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid pretence of exemption, conſidering of what importance it might bee, if the Councel ſhould meddle in ſuch a buſineſſe, making Edicts for their owne exaltation, and that this was to touch the ſecrets of the Eccleſiaſticall Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie, put it aſide with much dexteritie, alledging it would ſeeme ſtrange to the world, and too great a deſire of reuenge, offering to labour with the Pope, that hee would prouide for the ſecurity of their perſons, and haue conſideration of the families of the Prelates, and of the Friars. And ſo they appeaſed all.</p>
            <p>And going on to the Conciliary actions, the Cardinall of <hi>Monte</hi> related what forme was obſerued in the laſt <hi>Laterane</hi> Councel, where himſelfe was preſent, as Archbiſhop of <hi>Siponto.</hi> Hee ſaid, that treating then of the French Pragmatique, of the ſchiſme againſt <hi>Iulius</hi> 2. and of the warre betweene Chriſtian Princes, three deputations of Prelates were made for thoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that each Congregation beeing employed in one onely, it might better digeſt it; that the Decrees being framed, a generall Congregation was called, where euery one ſpake his opinion, and that by thoſe the reſolutions were better reformed, ſo that all things paſſed in the Seſſion with great concord and comlineſſe; that the buſineſſe to bee handled by them was more various, the Lutheranes hauing moued euery ſtone, to ouerthrow the building of <note place="margin">Card. <hi>Monte</hi> preſcribeth an order for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.</note> faith; therefore that it will bee neceſſary to diuide the matters, and for euery one to ordaine a particular Congregation to diſpute it, to cauſe the Deputies to frame the Decrees which are to bee propoſed in the generall Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where euery one ſhall deliuer his opinion: which that it might bee abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free, themſelues the Legates did reſolue to be propoſers onely, and not to giue their ſuffrage but in the Seſſion. That all ſhould bethinke themſelues what was neceſſary to be handled, that ſome beginning might be made in the Seſſion which approached.</p>
            <p>They propoſed then, whether they were pleaſed that a Decree already <note place="margin">A great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about the title of the Councel.</note> framed, concerning Chriſtian conuerſation while the Councel laſted in <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould bee publiſhed in the Seſſion. Which beeing read with the title, <hi>The most holy,</hi> as the commandement from <hi>Rome</hi> was, the French men deſired this addition, <hi>Repreſenting the Church Vniuerſall:</hi> which opinion many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops did follow with a ioynt conſent. But the Legates conſidering that that title was vſed onely in the Councel of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> and that to imitate them, was to renew their memorie, and to giue them ſome authority, and to open a gap to the difficulties which then troubled the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and which imported more, conſidering that after they had ſaid <hi>(Repreſenting the Church Vniuerſall)</hi> ſome alſo might thinke to adde the words following, that is, which hath power immediatly from CHRIST whereunto euery one,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17208:79"/>
though of Papall dignitie, is bound to obey, they oppoſed ſtrongly, and (as they wrote to <hi>Rome</hi> in plaine termes) they whetted themſelues againſt it, without declaring to the fathers the true cauſes, but onely ſaying they were froathy and inuidious words, and that the heretikes would haue made a bad interpretation of them. And they all ſo laboured, without diſcouering the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, firſt by art, then by ſaying plainely they would not permit it, that they appeaſed the generall commotion, though the French men and ſome few more remained firme in their propoſition.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Iohn de Salazzar,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lanciano,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard</hi> by Nation, aſſiſted the Legats very much, who hauing commended in ample termes the firſt Councels of the Church, for antiquity and ſanctitie of thoſe that aſſiſted, he deſired they ſhould bee imitated in the title vſed by them, which was very plaine, without expreſſing repreſentation, or what, or how great authoritie the Councell had. But hee pleaſed them not, when he ſaid, that, by their example the name of Preſidents ought to be laid aſide, becauſe it was neuer vſed by any ancient Councell, but begun onely by that of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which <note place="margin">The name of Preſidents was neuer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell before the Councell of <hi>Conſtance.</hi>
               </note> by reaſon of ſchiſme, changed Preſidents often: adding, that if that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample were to be followed, it would alſo be neceſſary to nominate the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Ambaſſadour. For then the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> was named, and the Princes with him. But this pride was farre remote from Chriſtian humility: and he repeated the diſcourſe of the Cardinall <hi>Santa Croce,</hi> which hee made the twelfth of December, by which alſo hee concluded, that they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt to make mention of Preſidencie. This propoſition troubled the Legats more then the former; yet the Cardinall <hi>Monte</hi> ſuddenly anſwered, that Councels haue ſpoken diuerſly, according to the occurrences of the times: that formerly the Pope hath alwayes beene acknowledged, for head of the Church, nor euer any Councell hath beene demaunded, with condition it ſhould not depend on the Pope, as the Duch-men now doe with great bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; vnto which hereticall temeritie it was fit to reſiſt in euery action, ſhewing they were ioyned with the head, which is the Pope, by making mentions of his Legats. Hee ſpake much in this matter, and knowing hee could better maintaine it by diuerſion, then perſwaſions, hee was a meanes they ſhould paſſe to another thing. The contents of the Decree was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by all; but there being one particle in it, in which euery one was exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to pray to God for the Pope, Emperour, and Kings, the <hi>French</hi> Prelats deſired there ſhould ſpeciall mention bee made of the <hi>French</hi> King. This the Cardinall <hi>Santa Croce</hi> commended, but added, that the like ſpecification would be expected by all in their place, which would proue a long buſineſſe, and full of danger, by reaſon of precedencie. The <hi>French</hi> men replied, that in the Bull of the conuocation, the Pope had made mention onely of the Emperour and <hi>French</hi> King; and therefore by that example they ſhould name them both, or neither. The Legats tooke time to thinke of it, being deſirous to giue euery one ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>The ſeuenth of Ianuary all the Prelats, clad in their ordinary habit, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <note place="margin">The ſeſſion Ianuary 7.</note> themſelues in the houſe of the prime Legat, from whence they went to the Cathedrall Church with the croſſe before them. Out of the Countrey of <hi>Trent</hi> were collected into the Citie three hundred foote, armed partly with
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17208:80"/>
pikes, and partly with harquebuſhes, and ſome horſe. Theſe put themſelues in file on either ſide the way, from the houſe of the Church; where the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats and Prelats beeing entred, the Souldiers returned to the market place, and diſcharged their harquebuſhes, and remained there to guard the Seſſion. Beſides the Legats and Cardinall of <hi>Trent,</hi> there were preſent foure Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, twenty eight Biſhops, three Abbats of the congregation of <hi>Caſsina,</hi> and foure generals, who ſat in the place of the Seſſion. Theſe forty three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons made the generall Councel. Of the Archbiſhops, two were titular only, neuer ſeene in the Churches, from which they had their name, which the Pope gaue them, only to do them honor; the one was <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Vpſala</hi> in <hi>Gothland,</hi> the other <hi>Robert Venante,</hi> a <hi>Scottiſh-man,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> who, though he were pore-blinde, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for his vertue, to ride poſt the beſt in the world. Theſe two men, hauing beene releeued certaine yeeres in <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Popes almes, were ſent to <hi>Trent</hi> to increaſe the number, and to depend on the Legats. About the number of twenty Diuines ſtood on their feete; the Ambaſſador of the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Proctor of the Cardinall of <hi>Ausburg</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſate vpon the Ambaſſadours bench, and neere vnto them, vpon the ſame bench, ſate ten Gentlemen, choſen out of the bordering places by the Cardinall of <hi>Trent. Iohn Fonſeca,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caſtelamare</hi> ſaid Maſſe, and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riolanus Martiranus,</hi> Biſhop of S. <hi>Marke,</hi> made the Sermon.</p>
            <p>When the Maſſe was ended, the Prelats put on their Pontificall habits, and then the Letanie and Prayers were ſaid, as in the firſt Seſſion. After this all ſate downe, and the Biſhop that ſaid Maſſe, mounting into the Pulpit, read the forenamed Bull, againſt admitting to giue voyce the Proctors of thoſe that were abſent, without mentioning the other, where thoſe of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie</hi> were excepted. Then he read the Decree, in which the Synod exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the faithfull aſſembled in <hi>Trent,</hi> to liue in the feare of God, and dayly to pray for the peace of Princes, and vnitie of the Church, and thoſe of the Councell to ſay Maſſe, at the leaſt on Sundaies, and to pray for the Pope, Emperour, Kings, and Princes, and all to faſt, giue almes, to be ſober, and to inſtruct their families. It exhorted alſo all men, eſpecially the learned, to bethinke themſelues exactly how to reſiſt hereſies, and in the aſſemblies to vſe modeſtie in ſpeaking. And it ordained beſide, that if any ſat not in their place, or gaue not voice, or was not preſent in their congregations, he ſhould not receiue any preiudice, or gaine any new right. The fathers being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, after this was read, they anſwered, <hi>it pleaſed them.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> men added, that they approued not ſo bare a title, and required an addition of <hi>Repreſenting the vniuerſall Church.</hi> In fine, the next ſeſſion was appointed the fourth of February, and the fathers had leaue to depart; who putting off their Pontificall habits, did, in their ordinarie apparell, accompanie the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats home in the ſame order they came to Church; which was obſerued in all the ſeſſions afterward.</p>
            <p>After the ſeſſion there was no congregation held vntill the thirteenth of Ianuary, becauſe <hi>Peter Pacceco,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Iahen,</hi> lately created Cardinall, who expected the hat from <hi>Rome,</hi> without which the ceremonie gaue him not leaue to goe abroad, had a deſire to be there, becauſe order was to bee taken
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17208:80"/>
therein, that no inconueniences ſhould happen in the ſeſſion. The congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation being aſſembled, the Legats complained of thoſe, who in the ſeſſion had oppoſed the title; they ſhewed it was not ſeemely to cauſe diuerſitie of opinions to appeare in that publike place; that the congregations were made that euery one might deliuer his mind more priuatly, and all agree in that which was to bee publiſhed; that nothing would more daunt the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, and encourage the Catholiques, then the fame of vnion. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the matter of the title, and ſaid, that none was more fit then that which the Pope had giuen in the Conuocation, and in ſo many other Bulls, where it was called, Oecumenicall and vniuerſall; vnto which it was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to adde <hi>(repreſentation)</hi> in regard whole bookes declare what a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell lawfully called, and begun, is, and doth repreſent; that by doing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhould ſeeme to make doubt of the authority thereof, and reſemble it to ſome other Councell, vnto which they gaue that title, being willing to ſupplie with words the lawfull authority which they knew it wanted, glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at that of <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Conſtance,</hi> but to make a firme reſolution they would haue euery one deliuer his opinion.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall <hi>Pacceco</hi> began to ſay, the Councell was adorned with very many titles, which if they were vſed in all occaſions, the expreſſion of them would bee greater then the body of the Decree. But as a great Emperour <note place="margin">A diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the title of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> poſſeſſour of many kingdomes and ſtates, vſeth in his Edicts the title onely from whence they haue force, and often putteth his owne name to them without any title at all, ſo this Councell, according to the Subiects that ſhall be handled, ought to vſe many titles to expreſſe its authoritie; but now that they are in the preparatories, there is no neceſſitie to vſe any of them at all. The Biſhop of <hi>Feltre</hi> put them in minde, that the Proteſtants deſired a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell where themſelues might haue a deciſiue voice, ſo that if this title be giuen to the Councell, that it repreſenteth the Church vniuerſall, they will draw an argument from hence, that ſome of euery order of the vniuerſall Church ought to be preſent. Theſe being two, the Clergie and the Laitie, it cannot be intirely repreſented, if the Laitie be excluded. But for the reſt, thoſe alſo of the Councell who aſſented to the ſimple title, were of opinion that it ought to bee ſupplied. The Biſhop of Saint <hi>Marke</hi> ſaid that the Laikes are moſt improperly called the Church. For the Canons determine that they haue no authority to command, but neceſſitie to obey, and that this is one of the things which the Councell ought to decree, that the Seculars ought humbly to receiue that doctrine of faith which is giuen them by the Church, without diſputing or thinking further on it; and therefore that it is very meete to vſe the title, that the Synode repreſenteth the Church vniuerſall, to make them vnderſtand that they are not the Church, but ought to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, and obey the Church. Many things were ſpoken and they went on without any firme concluſion but onely that the ſimple title ſhould bee vſed in the next ſeſſion, as it was in the laſt.</p>
            <p>When this was ended, becauſe certaine Prelates deſired, that at the laſt they might come to matters ſubſtantiall, the Legats, to giue them ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, propoſed that they ſhould conſider of the three heads contained in the Popes Bulls; that is, the extirpation of hereſies, reformation of diſcipline,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17208:81"/>
and eſtabliſhing of peace; how they ſhould beginne theſe treaties, what courſe they ſhould holde, and how proceede; that they ſhould pray God to illuminate them all, and euery one ſhould ſpeake his opinion in the firſt congregation. In the ende ſome commiſſions from abſent Biſhops were preſented; and the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Feltre</hi> and <hi>Aſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> were deputed to conſider of their excuſe, and relate in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>The next day the Legates wrote to <hi>Rome,</hi> that it appeared that the ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the title, with addition of <hi>Repreſenting the Church Vniuerſall,</hi> was a thing ſo popular and ſo pleaſed all, that it might eaſily be ſpoken of againe: and therefore they deſired to know his Holineſſe pleaſure if they ſhould perſiſt in denying it, or yeeld vnto them, eſpecially vpon occaſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome Decree of importance, as to condemne hereſies, or the like. They gaue aduice alſo, that they had made the propoſition for the next Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo generall, that they might yeelde to the deſire of the Prelates, which was to enter into the ſubſtantiall points, and yet enterpoſe time that they might receiue inſtruction from his Holineſſe. They added that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Pacceco</hi> had aduice, that the Emperor had giuen order to many Spaniſh Biſhops, men of exemplary liues, and learning, to goe to the Councel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thought it neceſſary, that his Holineſſe ſhould ſend ten or twelue Prelates, whom hee might truſt, men fit to appeare for their other qualities, that the number of the <hi>Oltramontans</hi> increaſing, eſpecially men rare, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplaritie <note place="margin">The Legates deſire to make their partie ſtrong.</note> and learning, they might in ſome part bee incountred. For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that vntill then were in <hi>Trent,</hi> thoſe that had good mindes had little learning, and leſſe diſcretion; and thoſe that had vnderſtanding, were diſcouered to haue deſeignes, and hard to be gouerned.</p>
            <p>In the next Congregation, aſſembled the eighteenth, to vnderſtand the <note place="margin">The Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts deſire to beginne with reformation.</note> mindes of all, concerning the Propoſitions made in the laſt, the opinions were foure. The Imperialiſts ſaid, that the points of doctrine could not bee touched, with hope of any fruit, becauſe it was firſt neceſſary to remooue the tranſgreſſions, from whence the hereſies aroſe, by a good reformation, enlarging themſelues very much in this field, and concluding that ſo long as the ſcandall which the World receiueth, by the deformation of the Clergie, ceaſeth not, nothing that they can ſay or preach will euer bee beleeued, all beeing perſwaded that deedes ought to bee regarded, and not words. And that they ought not to take example by the ancient Councels, becauſe in them either there was not corruption of maners, or that was not cauſe of hereſie; and in fine, that to deferre the treatie of reformation, was to ſhew themſelues incorrigible.</p>
            <p>Some few others thought fit to beginne with doctrine, and then to paſſe to reformation, alledging that faith is the ground and foundation of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an life; that no man begins to build from the roofe, but from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that it is a greater ſinne to erre in faith then in other humane actions; and that the point of rooting out hereſies was put firſt in the Popes Buls. A third opinion was, that the points of reformation and faith might ill bee ſeparated, becauſe there was no doctrine without abuſe, nor abuſe which drawed not after it the bad interpretation and bad ſenſe of ſome doctrine.

Therefore it was neceſſarie to handle them at the ſame time, for that the world hauing their eyes fixed vpon this Councell, and expecting a remedie as well in matters of faith as maners, it would be ſatisfied better by handling them both together, then one after another: eſpecially if according to the propoſition of the Cardinall of <hi>Monte,</hi> diuers deputations were made, and one handled this matter, and the other that, which ſhould be done quickely, conſidering that the time preſent, when Chriſtendome had peace, was preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and not to bee loſt, not knowing what impediments the time to come might bring. And the rather, becauſe they ſhould ſtudy to make the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell as ſhort as they could, that the Churches the leſſe while might remaine depriued of their Paſtours, and for many other reſpects, intimating that which might ariſe in length of time, to the diſtaſt of the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some others, among whom were the French men, demanded, that that of the peace might be the firſt: that they ſhould write vnto the Emperour, the moſt Chriſtian King, and other Princes, giuing them thankes for the conuocation of the Councel, for continuance whereof that they would eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh peace, and helpe the worke forward, by ſending their Ambaſſadours and Prelates; and likewiſe ſhould write friendly to the Lutheranes, inuiting them charitably to come to the Councell, and ioyne themſelues with the reſt of Chriſtendome. The Legates, vnderſtanding the opinions of them all, and commending their wiſedome, ſaid, that becauſe it was late, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation of weight, and the opinions various, they would thinke of what euery one had ſaid, and, in the firſt Congregation, propoſe the points to bee determined.</p>
            <p>Order was taken that there ſhould bee two Congregations euery weeke, <note place="margin">Two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery weeke, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation.</note> on Munday and Friday, without warning: and in the end the Archbiſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> hauing receiued letters from the moſt Chriſtian King, ſaluted the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node in his Name, and promiſed that his Maieſtie would ſuddenly ſend an Ambaſſadour, and many Prelates of his Kingdome; and ſo the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ended.</p>
            <p>The Legates ſent aduice of all to <hi>Rome,</hi> and wrote that they had drawen in length the reſolution of the things that were handled, vnder the pretences before related, but in truth to gaine more time, that they might receiue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and orders how to gouerne themſelues; beſeeching his Holineſſe againe to make his will knowne, and to conſider aboue all, that to prolong the Councell, and hold it open, when he might make it ſhort, was not good for the Apoſtolique Sea: adding that they were conſtrained to hold two Congregations euery weeke, to keepe the Prelates in exerciſe, and to take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from them to make them by themſelues. But they ſaid that this would draw on the buſineſſe very faſt, and therefore that it was neceſſary to take ſome courſe to reſolue their propoſes quickely, and not to deferre to anſwere them, as hitherto hath beene done, but to aduiſe them what they ought to do preſently, and to foreſee, as much as might be, what could happen. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had written oftentimes, that many poore Biſhoppes came to the Councell, for the hope and good promiſes which his holineſſe and Cardinall <hi>Farneſe</hi> had giuen them, they then repeated it, adding, it was an error to think
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17208:82"/>
to vſe them as homely in <hi>Trent,</hi> as in <hi>Rome,</hi> where, hauing no authority, they are humble and in ſubiection; but when they are in the Councell, they thinke they ſhould be eſteemed and maintained, which if it be not done, it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not to haue them in that place, then to haue them there ill ſatisfied, and diſtaſted; concluding that that enterpriſe could not ſucceed Well, without diligence and coſt.</p>
            <p>It may generally ſeeme ſtrange, that the Pope, a wiſe man, and skilfull in the affaires of the world, ſhould not giue anſwere vnto two particulars, of ſuch importance and neceſsitie, in ſo long a time, after ſo many inſtances of his miniſters. But his holineſſe grounded not his hopes vpon the Councell; all his cogitations were turned toward the warre, which the Cardinall <hi>Farneſe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Pope is more intent vpon the war againſt the Proteſtants, then vpon the Councell.</note> treated with the Emperour the yeere before, and could not forbeare to make demonſtration thereof: neither did the Emperour deſire the Councell ſhould proceed, it being ſufficient for his ends that it was opened onely.</p>
            <p>But the Prelates, who deſired to begin with reformation, and leaue the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine behind, aſsiſted by the Emperours Miniſters, aſſayed to draw the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">A controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, whether with reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, or with both together.</note> to them: which thing being very eaſie, becauſe the reformation was generally deſired, and not much beleeued, their number grew ſo great, that the Legats were confounded. Therefore by themſelues and their friends they often dealt priuatly with diuers, and laſtly, in the congregation of the 22. day, all three one after another ſet themſelues to ruine the foundations which were laid in fauour of the reformation. One reaſon, drawen from the Emperours propoſition in the Diet of <hi>Wormes</hi> the laſt May, made a great impreſsion, when he ſaid they ought to expect what the Councell would doe in the definitions of doctrine, and in the reformation; and, that if nothing were done, he would intimate another Diet, to accommodate the differences of religion, and correct the abuſes: arguing from hence, that if they handled not the points of doctrine, the determinations of the future Colloquie and Diet would bee canonized; neither could they with reaſon hinder them to treat of religion in <hi>Germanie,</hi> which themſelues refuſed to doe in the Councell.</p>
            <p>There was a great rich Prelate in the congregation, who, with a premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated ſpeech, went about to ſhew, that they ought onely to ayme at the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, aggrauating much the common deformation of the whole Clergie, and inculcating, that ſo long as our veſſels were not cleanſed, the holy Ghoſt would not dwell in them, and by conſequence, that no right iudgment could be expected in matters of faith.</p>
            <p>But the Cardinall <hi>Santa Croce</hi> taking from hence occaſion to ſpeake, ſaid, that there was no reaſon to deferre the reformation of themſelues, who were to manage the Councell, but that was eaſie and ready, and might ſuddenly be executed, without delaying the points of doctrine, which were intricate of themſelues, and of long digeſtion. He much commended that prelate for making mention of a thing ſo holy, and of ſo good example: for beginning from themſelues, they might eaſily reforme all the reſt of the world; and hee earneſtly exhorted all to come to the practiſe thereof. This opinion was much commended by all, but not followed; for many ſoid, the reformation ought to bee generall, without looſing time in that particular. Therefore
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:17208:82"/>
they all concluded, except two, that the Articles of Religion and reformation ſhould be handled together, as they are alike deſired, and deemed neceſſarie by the whole world, and ioyntly propoſed in the Popes Bulls. The Legats were content with this reſolution, though they rather deſired to treate of faith, and leaue the reformation. But ſo great was their feare that they ſhould be conſtrained to handle reformation alone, that they thought it <note place="margin">A reſolution made to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle doctrine and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion together.</note> a great victorie to ioyne them together. And they thought alſo that their opinion to leaue the reformation was dangerous, becauſe they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt all the Prelates and States of Chriſtendome, who deſired it, which they could not doe without much ſcandall, and infamie. If this courſe which they tooke, being conſtrained thereunto by meere neceſſitie, ſhould not pleaſe thoſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> they could not complaine of any but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, who were ſo often ſolicited to anſwere the letters, and ſend neceſſary inſtructions.</p>
            <p>Afterwards it was reſolued to write to the Pope to thanke him for cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and opening the Councell, and to deſire him to maintaine and fauour it, and to bee a meanes vnto Chriſtian Princes to continue peace among themſelues, and excite them to ſend Ambaſſadors to the Councell. They reſolued alſo to write to the Emperour, the French King, Kings of the Romans, of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and other Catholike Princes, to preſerue peace, to ſend Ambaſſadours, ſecure the wayes, to mooue their Prelates to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare perſonally in the Councell. The care of writing theſe letters was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Biſhop of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> and were to be read and ſealed in the next congregation.</p>
            <p>The Legates publiſhed two points to bee conſidered of by the Fathers, whereof they were to giue their voices. The firſt, whether in the next ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the heads of faith, and thoſe of reformation which were correſpondent, ſhould bee handled together. The ſecond how to proceed in making choice of the two heads, and in handling and examining them. The Legats thought they had by theſe propoſitions diſburthened themſelues of the importunate queſt made by ſome, to eſtabliſh ſome ſubſtantiall point in euery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and withall to haue ſhewed that they held the Prelates in eſteeme.</p>
            <p>The next congregation was ſpent in reading many letters, and diſputing <note place="margin">A Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> what Seale to vſe. Some propoſed they ſhould bee ſealed in leade, with a Bull proper to the Synode, in which ſome would haue on the one ſide the image of the holy ghoſt in the forme of a Doue, and the name of the Synod on the other, and ſome deſired other formes, all which were glorious. But the Legats, who had another order from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſuffering the fathers to diſpute heereon, diuerted the propoſition by ſaying it ſauored of pride, and protracted the time, becauſe they muſt ſend to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> to make the forme of it, in regard no Artiſan in <hi>Trent</hi> was able to doe it; adding that it might bee better thought of afterwards, and that it was neceſſarie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the letters now, which might bee done by the name and ſeale of the Prime Legat. That which remained was put off vntill the next Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>In the which, the two points before propoſed were diſcuſſed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">A Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:17208:83"/>
the firſt, there were two opinions. One that the Decree ſhould bee framed and publiſhed: the other that it was not good to tie themſelues with a Decree, but to keepe their libertie, and reſolue as occaſion ſhould ſerue. They tooke a middle courſe; to make mention onely that the Synode was principally aſſembled for theſe two cauſes, without going any further. But for the ſecond point the maior part were of opinion, that they being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to condemne the Lutheran hereſie, they ſhould follow the order of their confeſſion; which others contradicted, becauſe it was an imitation of the Colloquies in <hi>Germanie,</hi> which would debaſe the dignitie of the Councel. And the two firſt heads of the Auguſtan confeſſion being of the Trinitie, and incarnation, in which there was no ſubſtantiall difference, though they were expreſſed after a new maner, and vnuſuall in the Schooles, if they ſhould bee approoued, reputation would bee giuen them, and they could not ſo well condemne the reſt; and in caſe they would neither approoue nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them, and ſpeake of them not with the termes of that confeſſion, but of the Schooles or others, there was danger to raiſe new diſputes and new ſchiſmes. The Legates, who aimed at nothing but to driue out the time, were glad to heare the difficulties, and did carefully cheriſh them, ſometimes incouraging one; and ſometimes another.</p>
            <p>The time prefixed for the ſeſſion approaching, the Legats, hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">The Legates were perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> no inſtruction from <hi>Rome,</hi> were much perplexed. For to paſſe that ſeſſion, as the former, in ceremonies only, was to looſe all reputation; and to handle any matter was dangerous, becauſe they had not their marke prefixed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at to aime. That which ſeemed to haue leaſt perill, was to frame a decree vpon the reſolution taken in the congregation, to handle the points of faith and reformation together: whereunto oppoſition was made, that it was to bind themſelues, and to determine that in the congregation, which was vndecided by the Pope. In this ambiguitie it was propoſed that they ſhould make a dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory decree, vnder pretence that many Prelats were in their iourny, and would ſhortly come thither. Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi> told them, that in regard a confeſſion of faith hath been made in all the ancient Cauncels, the ſame ſhould be done in that ſeſſion, publiſhing that of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> At the laſt it was reſolued to make the Decree with a ſimple title, and to make mention therein that they ought to treat of religion, and reformation; but in ſuch generall termes, that the Creed might be recited, and paſſed ouer, making another Decree to deferre the materiall points vntill another ſeſſion, alleadging for a reaſon that ſome Prelates were ready to ſet forward, and ſome in their iourney already: and to prolong the terme of the next ſeſſion as long as they could, for feare of being brought into the like ſtraits: yet ſo as not to put it off vntill after Eaſter.</p>
            <p>When this was framed, they imparted it to the Prelates they truſted moſt, amongſt whom the Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto</hi> put to their conſideration, that to make a ſeſſion to eſtabliſh a Creed, made 1200. yeeres before, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beleeued, and now abſolutely accepted by al, might be laughed at by thoſe that were enuious, and ill expounded by others. That they cannot ſay they follow the Fathers example in this: becauſe they haue either made aconfeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion againſt the hereſies they did condemne, or repeated the former
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17208:83"/>
made againſt the hereſies already condemned, to giue them greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, adding ſome thing for declaration, or to reduce it into memorie, or to ſecure it againſt obliuion. But now neither a new confeſſion was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor a declaration adioyned. To giue them more authoritie belonged not to them, nor to that age. To recall it into memorie, in regard it was repeated euery weeke in all Churches, and was in the freſh memorie of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, was a thing ſuperfluous, and affected. That the heretikes ought to bee conuinced by the confeſſion, was true of thoſe who erred againſt it: but it was not ſo of the Lutherans, who beleeued it as the Catholikes. If when this preparation ſhall bee made, the confeſſion bee neuer vſed to this purpoſe, it will bee thought to bee done to no other end then to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the time, and to ſprinkle Court-holy-water, not daring to touch the poynts of doctrine, nor being willing to meddle with the reformation. He thought it better to interpoſe delay, in regard of the expectation of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and ſo to end the Seſſion.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Chioza</hi> added, that the reaſons alleadged might ſerue the heretikes turnes, by ſaying, that if the confeſſion can ſerue to conuert infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, ouercome the heretikes, and confirme the faithfull, they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to beleeue any thing beſides. The Legat iudged not theſe reaſons to be ſo ſtrong as the contrary, that not to make a Decree was loſſe of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore they reſolued on that ſide, and fitted ſome words better, according to the aduertiſements of the Prelates, and propoſed the Decree in the Congregation of the firſt of February. Of this many things were ſayd; and though it was approued by the maior part, yet in the end of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation it gaue diſtaſte, and ſome of the Prelates ſaid, reaſoning among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, it will be ſaid, that by a worke of twenty yeeres time, it hath beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that we ſhould be brought to heare the Creed repeated.</p>
            <p>The fourth day, deſtinated for the Seſſion, they went to Church with <note place="margin">The Seſsion.</note> the ſame ceremonies and company; in which <hi>Peter Tragliania,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Palermo,</hi> ſang Maſſe, <hi>Ambroſe Catarin</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> a Dominican Friar, Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Torre,</hi> read the Decree: the ſubſtance whereof was, that the Synod, <note place="margin">The Decree is read.</note> conſidering the importance of the two points to be treated of, that is, the extirpation of hereſies, and reformation of manners, exhorteth all to truſt in God, and arme themſelues with ſpirituall weapons, and that their diligence may haue both beginning and progreſſe from the grace of God, it determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to begin from the confeſſion of faith, imitating the examples of the Fathers, who in the principall Councels, in the beginning of the actions, haue oppoſed that buckler againſt the hereſies, and ſometimes haue conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the infidels, &amp; ouercome the heretikes with that alone; in which all that profeſſe Chriſtianitie doe agree. And here the whole was repeated word by word, without adding any other concluſion. And the Archbiſhop asked the Fathers, whether the Decree pleaſed them. All anſwered affirmatiuely, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſome with conditions and additions of no great moment, yet ſuch as diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Cardinall of <hi>Monte;</hi> who liked not they ſhould deſcend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the Seſſions, fearing that when ſome matter of weight was to bee <note place="margin">The eighth of Aprill is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the next Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> treated of, ſome inconuenience might ariſe. Afterwards the other Decree was read, intimating the Seſſion for the eighth of Aprill, alleadging for a
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:17208:84"/>
cauſe of the delay, that many Prelates were in a readineſſe to come, and ſome were in the iourney, and for that the deliberations of the Synod will be more eſteemed when they ſhall bee ſtrengthened by the counſell and preſence of of more Fathers; yet ſo as that they would not deferre the diſcuſſion and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of what ſeemed fit to be handled preſently.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ſtood all amazed at the very name of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was well pleaſed to heare that the Councell entertained it ſelfe in pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, hoping that time would bring foorth ſome remedie. And the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that had intemperate tongues, exerciſed their gibing, publiſhing diuers bitter Paſquins, as then the cuſtome was in all accidents, ſome commending <note place="margin">Paſquins made againſt the Seſſion.</note> the Prelates aſſembled in <hi>Trent,</hi> for making a moſt noble decree, worthy of a generall Councel, and ſome exhorting them to vnderſtand their owne worth and knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Legates in giuing the Pope an account of the Seſſion held, ſent alſo aduiſe, that it would be hard to oppoſe, and ouercome thoſe who deſired to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <note place="margin">The Legates giue the Pope an account of the Seſſion.</note> the title, with the repreſentation of the Church vniuerſall; yet they would endeauour to remooue the difficulties. But that it was impoſſible to entertaine the Prelates any more without comming to, and doing ſome eſſentiall matter; and therefore that they expected the order and inſtruction which they ſo often had demanded. That for their parts they thought it fit to handle thoſe points of the holy Scripture, which were in controuerſie betweene them and the Lutherans, and the abuſe brought into the Church in that matter; which things would much ſatisfie the world, and offend no man: and they would expect an anſwere for this, there beeing ſpace enough to examine thoſe matters, and many occaſions to driue out the time vntill the beginning of Lent.</p>
            <p>But though the Councell was then opened, and ſtill celebrated, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of <hi>Germanie</hi> continued the ſame. In the beginning of the yeere the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector <note place="margin">The affaires of <hi>Germanie</hi> continue the ſame, And the <hi>Palatine</hi> embraceth the reformed religion.</note> 
               <hi>Palatine</hi> brought in the vſe of the Chalice, the popular tongue in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique prayers, the marriage of Prieſts, and other things which were refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before in other places. And thoſe that were appointed by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to bee preſent in the meeting, to finde out a way to compoſe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Religion, met together at a Colloquie in <hi>Ratisbon.</hi> The Emperor deputed for Preſidents the Biſhop of <hi>Eicstat,</hi> and the <hi>Conte</hi> of <hi>Furstemberg:</hi> but no good fruit grew thereof, by reaſon of the ſuſpicions which one part conceiued againſt the other, and becauſe the Catholikes omitted no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to giue greater iealouſies to the other ſide, and to faine them of their owne, which finally made the Colloquie to diſſolue.</p>
            <p>The fifteenth of February <hi>Martin Luther</hi> died alſo. Theſe newes being <note place="margin">Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>dieth</hi>
               </note> ſent to <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> there was not ſo much griefe for the change of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> as ioy that the Colloquie ſucceeded not well, but ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">The Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts reioyce at his death and at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Colloquie without fruit.</note> to diſſolution, and that <hi>Luther</hi> was dead. The Colloquie ſeemed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councell, and gaue great iealouſie; becauſe, if any thing had beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, they ſaw not how the Councell could after reiect it, and, if it had beene accepted, it would ſeeme that the Councell receiued lawes from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. And by all meanes the Colloquie being on foote, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours miniſters there preſent, it brought ſmall reputation to the Councell
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:17208:84"/>
and the Pope. The Fathers in <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Court in <hi>Rome</hi> conceiued great hope, ſeeing that ſo potent an inſtrument, to contradict the doctrine and rites of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was dead; who was the principall, and almoſt the totall cauſe of the diuiſions and innouations introduced, and held it for a preſage of the good ſucceſſe of the Councell; and the rather becauſe that death was diuulged throughout <hi>Italy,</hi> with many prodigious and fabulous circumſtances, which were aſcribed to miracle, and the vengeance of God, though there were but the vſuall accidents, which doe ordinarily happen in the deaths of men of ſixtie three yeeres of age: for in that age <hi>Martin Luther</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Fables rayſed vpon <hi>Luthers</hi> death.</note> died. But thoſe things that happened afterwards euen vntill our age, haue declared that <hi>Martin</hi> was onely one of the meanes, and that the cauſes were more potent and ſecret.</p>
            <p>The Emperour beeing arriued in <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> complained grieuouſly that <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors letters concerning the Colloquy were laughed at.</note> the Colloquie was diſſolued, and wrote letters thereof throughout all <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> which were laughed at, becauſe it was too much knowne that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration was wrought by the Spaniards and Friars, and by the Biſhop of <hi>Eic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat,</hi> whom hee had ſent. And when the workemen are knowne, it is not hard to iudge whence the beginning of the motion doth proceed. But the wiſe Emperour was willing to vſe the ſame thing to ſatisfie the Pope and the Councel, and to finde an occaſion againſt the Proteſtants; which the euent ſhewed to bee true. For the ſame complaints beeing renewed in the Diet, and meanes of agreement beeing ſought by thoſe that were aſſembled, the Miniſters of <hi>Ments</hi> and <hi>Triers</hi> ſeparating themſelues from the other Electors, and adhering to the other Biſhops, approoued the Councell, and deſired the Emperour to protect it, and to cauſe the Proteſtants to be there, and ſubmit themſelues to it. But they did reſiſt and remonſtrate that that Councell had not thoſe qualities and conditions ſo often promiſed, and deſired that the peace might bee kept, and the differences in religion accorded in a lawfull Councel in <hi>Germanie,</hi> or in an Imperiall Diet. But in the end the maskes <note place="margin">The prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for warre were knowne</note> were remooued, and the prouiſions for war could no longer be hid; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention ſhall bee made in its proper place. The Pope conſidered very much of the letter written from <hi>Trent,</hi> weighing the inconueniences that would follow, if hee kept the Councell at anchor, with the ill ſatisfaction of the Biſhops that were there, and the miſchiefe that might ariſe if the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhould begin. In fine, perceiuing that it was neceſſary to put ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the hazard, and that it was wiſdome to auoid the greater euill, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to write backe to <hi>Trent,,</hi> to begin the action as they had aduiſed, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing them not to broach any new difficulties in matter of faith, nor to determine any of the things controuerſed amongſt the Catholiques, and to proceed ſlowly in the reformation. The Legates, who vntill then had in the Congregations entertained themſelues in generall matters, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued power to goe on, propoſed in the Congregation of the 22. of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, that the firſt foundation of faith beeing eſtabliſhed, they ought in the next place to handle another more ample, which is the holy Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are points belonging to the doctrines controuerted with the Lutheranes, and others, for reformation of thoſe abuſes which are moſt principall, and neceſſary to be amended; and ſo many, that perhaps the time vntill the next
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17208:85"/>
Seſſion will not bee ſufficient to finde a remedy for all. They diſcourſed of the controuerſies with the Lutherans in this ſubiect, and of the abuſes, and much was ſpoken hereof by diuers Prelates.</p>
            <p>The Diuines, who were thirty in number, and almoſt all Friars, had vntill then ſerued in the Councell onely to make Sermons on Holy-dayes, in exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Councell and the Pope, and to make light skirmiſhes with the Lutheranes; but now that controuerted doctrines were to bee decided, and the abuſes of learned men rather then of others to bee reformed, their worth <note place="margin">The Diuines begin to be eſteemed.</note> beganne to appeare. And order was taken that in the points of doctrine to be decided; articles ſhould be extracted out of the bookes of the Lutheranes contrary to the orthodox faith, to bee ſtudied and cenſured by the Diuines, that euery one ſpeaking his opinion of them, the matter might bee prepared to frame the Decrees, which being propoſed in the Congregation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the Fathers, when euery mans voyce was knowen, that might bee eſtabliſhed which was to bee publiſhed in the Seſſion. And for the abuſes, euery one ſhould call to mind what hee thought worthy of amendment, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the remedy fit for it.</p>
            <p>The articles for matter of doctrine, drawen out of the Lutheranes bookes, were,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the neceſſary doctrine of Chriſtian faith, is wholy conteyned in the holy Scripture, and that it is an humane inuention, to adde vnto them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions, as left vnto the holy Church by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, deriued vnto vs by meanes of the continuall ſucceſſion of Biſhops, and that it is ſacrilege to defend that they are of equall authority with the old and new Teſtament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That amongſt the bookes of the old Teſtament, none ſhould bee rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned but thoſe that haue beene receiued by the Iewes, and in the New the ſixe Epiſtles, that is, that vnder the name of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Hebrews, that of S. <hi>Iames,</hi> the 2. of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the 2. and 3. of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> one of S. <hi>Iude,</hi> and the <hi>Apocalyps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That to vnderſtand the Scripture well, or to alledge the proper words, it is neceſſary to haue recourſe to the texts of the originall tongue in which it is written, and to reprooue the Latine tranſlation; as full of errors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the diuine Scripture is moſt eaſie and perſpicuous, and that to vnderſtand it, neither gloſſe nor comment is neceſſary, but onely to haue the ſpirit of a ſheepe of Chriſts paſture.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether Canons, with Anathematiſmes adioyned, ſhould be framed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all theſe Articles.</p>
            <p>Vpon the two firſt, the Diuines diſcourſed in foure Congregations; and in the firſt all agreed, that the Chriſtian faith is contayned partly in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and partly in Traditions; and much time was ſpent in alledging for this places of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who often ſpeakes of them; and many were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred out of <hi>Irenie, Cyprian, Baſil, Auſtin,</hi> and others; yea ſome ſaid more, that Tradition was the onely foundation of the Catholique doctrine. For the Scripture it ſelfe is not beleeued but by tradition. But there was ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence how this matter might fitly be handled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vicenzo Lunello,</hi> a Franciſcan Friar, was of opinion, that, in regard the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17208:85"/>
holy, Scripture and traditions were to be eſtabliſhed for ground of faith, they ought firſt to treat of the Church, which is a more principal foundation. For the Scripture receiueth authority from it, according to the famous ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Saint <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> I would not haue beleeued the Goſpel if the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church had not compelled me; and no vſe can be made of traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but by grounding them vpon the ſame authority. For if a controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie <note place="margin">Diſcourſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of traditions.</note> ariſe about a tradition, it will bee neceſſary to decide it either by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or by the determination of the Church. But this foundation being laid, that euery Chriſtian is bound to beleeue the Church; one may ſecurely build thereon. He added, that they ſhould take example from all thoſe that haue ſubſtantially written againſt the Lutherans, as Fryar <hi>Siluester,</hi> and <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> who haue more alleadged the authoritie of the Church, then any other argument; neither is it poſſible to conuince the Lutherans otherwiſe. That it is contrary to the end propoſed, (that is to lay all the foundations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doctrine) to leaue out the principall, and perhaps the onely ground, but certainely that without the which, the reſidue cannot ſubſiſt. This opinion had no followers. Some oppoſed againſt it, that it was ſubiect to the ſame difficulties which it made to others. For the Synagogues of the heretiques alſo would arrogate to bee the true Church, vnto whom this authoritie was giuen. Others holding it to be a thing moſt knowen and vndoubted, that by the name of the Church the Cleargie ought to bee vnderſtood, and more properly the Councell and the Pope as head, ſaid they ought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the authority of the Church is already decided, and that to treat of it now were to ſhew there was difficultie, or at the leaſt, that it was a thing newly cleered, and not moſt ancient, euer beleeued ſince Chriſtianitie began.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Anthonius Marinarus,</hi> a Carmelite Fryar, thought fit to refraine ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of traditions, and ſaid, that for deciſion of the firſt Article in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was meete firſt to determine whether the queſtion were <hi>facti,</hi> or <hi>iuris:</hi> that is, if the Chriſtian doctrine haue two parts, one which was written by the will of God, and the other which was forbidden to bee writ, but onely taught by word of mouth; or if in the whole body of doctrine it hath acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally happened, that all hauing beene taught, ſome part hath not beene committed to writing. Hee added, that it was a cleere caſe that the Maieſtie of God ordaining the law of the Old Teſtament, appointed it ſhould be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to haue it in writing; and therefore wrote the Decalogue in ſtone with his owne finger, commaunding it ſhould be laid vp in the Cabinet, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Arke of the Couenant. That he often commaunded <hi>Moyſes</hi> to write the precepts in a booke, and that one copie ſhould bee kept in the Arke, and the King haue another to reade it continually.</p>
            <p>This fell not out in the Goſpell, which the Sonne of God wrote in the hearts, for which neither tables, nor cheſt, nor booke is neceſſary: yea, the Church was moſt perfect before any of the Apoſtles wrote; and though they had writ nothing, the Church would haue wanted nothing of its perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But as Chriſt founded the doctrine of the New Teſtament in the hearts, ſo hee forbad it not to bee written, as in ſome falſe Religions, where the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries were kept ſecret, nor was lawfull to write them, but onely to teach
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17208:86"/>
them by word of mouth. And therefore that it is an vndoubted truth, that whatſoeuer the Apoſtles haue written, and whatſoeuer they haue taught by word of mouth, is of equall authority, becauſe they wrote and ſpake by the inſtinct of the holy Ghoſt, which notwithſtanding, as, by aſſiſting them; it hath directed them to write and preach the trueth, ſo it cannot bee ſaid it hath forbidden them to write any thing, to the end to hold it in my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie; wherefore the Articles of faith cannot bee diſtinguiſhed into two kinds, ſome publiſhed by writing, others commaunded to bee communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely by voyce. Hee ſaid, that whoſoeuer thought otherwiſe, muſt fight againſt two great difficulties; the one, to tell wherein the difference is, the other, how the Apoſtles ſucceſſors haue beene able to write that which was forbidden by God: adding, that it was as hard to maintaine the third, that is, how it hath accidentally happened, that ſome particulars haue not beene written, becauſe it would derogate from the prouidence of God in directing the holy Apoſtles to compoſe the Scriptures of the New Teſtament. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">The Fathers neuer made traditions of equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the Scripture.</note> hee concluded, that to enter into this treatie, was to ſaile betweene <hi>Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hee added, that it was not neceſſary to proceede now to any new determination, becauſe the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans, though they ſaid they would be conuinced by the Scripture onely, haue not made a controuerſie in this article, and that it is good to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues onely to the controuerſies which they haue promoted, without ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting new on foote, expoſing themſelues to the danger of making a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion in Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>The Fryars opinion pleaſed but few; yea, Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> reprehended it, <note place="margin">The opinion of <hi>Marina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was very diſtaſtefull.</note> and ſaid, it better beſeemed a Colloquie in <hi>Germanie,</hi> then a Councell of the vniuerſall Church: that in this they ſhould ayme at the ſincere veritie it ſelfe, not as there, where nothing is handled but the according of the parties, though to the preiudice of the truth; that to preſerue the Church, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie that the Lutherans ſhould receiue all the <hi>Romane</hi> doctrine, or that as many of their errors as was poſſible might be diſcouered, the more to make manifeſt to the world, that there was no agreement to be made with them. Therefore if they haue framed no controuerſie concerning traditions, it was neceſſary to frame it now, and to condemne their opinions, and to ſhew, that that doctrine not onely differeth from the true, in that wherein it doeth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely contradict it but in all other parts: that they ſhould endeauour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne as many abſurdities as can be drawen out of their writings, and that the feare was vaine to daſh againſt <hi>Scilla</hi> or <hi>Caribdis</hi> for that captious reaſon, whereunto whoſoeuer gaue ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> would conclude there was no tradition at all.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Article they all agreed in this, that a Catalogue ſhould bee <note place="margin">Concerning the canon cal bookes of the Scripture.</note> made, (as it was in former times) of the Canonicall bookes, in which all ſhould be regiſtred which are read in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, euen thoſe of the Old Teſtament, which were neuer receiued by the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> And for proofe of this, they all alledged the Councell of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> Pope <hi>Innocence</hi> the firſt, the third Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and Pope <hi>Gelaſius.</hi> But there were foure opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:17208:86"/>
Some would haue two rankes made; in the firſt onely thoſe ſhould be put, which without contradiction haue beene receiued by all: in the other thoſe, which ſometime haue beene reiected, or haue had doubt made of them; and it was ſaid, though formerly this was neuer done by any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell or Pope, yet alwayes it was ſo vnderſtood. For <hi>Auſtin</hi> maketh ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and his authority hath beene canonized in the Chapter <hi>In Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicis.</hi> And Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> who was after <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> writing vpon <hi>Iob,</hi> ſayeth of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> that they are written for edification, though they bee not Canonicall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aloiſius</hi> of <hi>Catanea,</hi> a Domican Fryar, ſaid that this diſtinction was made by Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> who was receiued by the Church, as a rule and direction, to appoint the Canon of the Scriptures; and he alleadged Cardinal <hi>Caietan</hi> who had diſtinguiſhed them, following Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> as an infallible rule, giuen vs by the Church; and ſo hee wrote to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeuenth, when hee ſent him his expoſition vpon the Hiſtoricall bookes of the Old Teſtament. Some thought fit to eſtabliſh three rankes. The firſt of thoſe which alwayes haue beene held for Diuine; the ſecond, of thoſe whereof ſometimes doubt hath beene made, but by vſe haue obtained Canonicall authority, in which number are the ſixe Epiſtles, and the Apocalyps of the New Teſtament, and ſome ſmall parts of the Euangeliſts. The third, of thoſe whereof there hath neuer beene any aſſurance; as are the ſeauen of the Old Teſtament, and ſome Chapters of <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Heſter.</hi> Some thought it better to make no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction at all, but to imitate the Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> and others, making the Catalogue, and ſaying no more. Another opinion was that all of them ſhould bee declared to bee in all partes, as they are in the Latine Bible, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and equall authoritie. The Booke of <hi>Baruc</hi> troubled them moſt, which is not put in the number, neither by the Laodiceans, nor by thoſe of <hi>Carthage,</hi> nor by the Pope, and therefore ſhould be left out, as well for this reaſon, as becauſe the beginning of it cannot be found. But becauſe it was read in the Church, the Congregation (eſteeming this a potent reaſon) reſolued, that it was by the Ancients accounted a part of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and compriſed with him.</p>
            <p>In the Congregation on Friday the fifth of March, aduiſe being come <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in Councell, is in danger of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in <hi>Rome</hi> for not paying his Penſionaries.</note> that the Penſionaries of the Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto</hi> had demanded in <hi>Rome</hi> to be paide, and for this cauſe had cited him before the Auditor, requiring hee ſhould bee compelled by excommunications and other cenſures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtile of the Court, to make payment, hee lamented his caſe, and ſaid that his Penſioners were in the right, and yet himſelfe was not in the wrong. For ſo long as hee was in the Councell hee could not ſpend leſſe then ſixe hundred crownes by the yeere, and that his penſions being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, hee had left but foure hundred: wherefore it was neceſſarie that hee ſhould bee disburthened or aſſiſted with the other two hundred. The poore Prelates laboured herein, as in a common cauſe, and ſome of them paſſed to high wordes, and ſaid it was an infamie to the Councell, that an officer of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould bee ſuffered to vſe cenſures againſt a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop aſſiſting in the Councell; that it was a thing monſtrous, and would make the world ſay that the Councell was not free; that the honour of that
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:17208:87"/>
aſſembly required that the Auditor ſhould be cited to <hi>Trent,</hi> or ſome reuenge taken againſt him, that the dignity of the Synod might be preſerued. Some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo proceeded ſo farre as to condemne the impoſition of penſions, ſaying, that it was iuſt and anciently obſerued, that the rich Churches ſhould aſſiſt the poore, not by conſtraint, but by charity, without taking things neceſſary from themſelues, and that S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught ſo But that poore Prelates ſhould be conſtrained to giue to the rich, ſome of that which is neceſſary for their owne ſuſtenance, was a thing intolerable; and that this was one of the points of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to be handled in the Councel, reducing it to the ancient, and truely Chriſtian vſe. But the Legats, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering how iuſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints were, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they might tend, appeaſed all, &amp; promiſed they would write to <hi>Rome,</hi> and cauſe the iudiciall proceſſe to ſurceaſe, and to endeuor that the Biſhop ſhould in ſome ſort be prouided for, that he might maintain himſelfe in the Councel.</p>
            <p>All the Diuines hauing made an end of ſpeaking the eighth day, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation <note place="margin">A Decree made on the day of <hi>Carno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual,</hi> that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are of equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the Scriptures.</note> was intimated for the next, though it was no ordinary day, not ſo much to eſtabliſh quickly a Decree vpon the diſputed Articles, as for a grace of the Councell, that in that day, dedicated to a profane feaſt of the <hi>Carnoual,</hi> the Fathers ſhould buſie themſelues in the affaires of the Councell. And then it was approued by all, that the Traditions ſhould bee receiued as of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall authority with the Scriptures. But they agreed not in the manner of making the Catalogue of the Diuine bookes; and there were three opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: One, not to deſcend to particular bookes; another, to diſtinguiſh the Catalogue into three parts; a third, to make onely one, and to make all the bookes of equall authoritie. And not beeing all well reſolued, three draughts were made, and order giuen that they ſhould exactly conſider which of them ſhould be receiued in the next Congregation; which was not held the twelfth day, by reaſon of the arriuall of <hi>Don Francis</hi> of <hi>Toledo,</hi> ſent <note place="margin">

            <p>At this time <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ergerius,</hi> who often hath beene named before, came to <note place="margin">

               <hi>Trent,</hi> not ſo much with deſire to aſſiſt in the Councell, as to flie the rage of his people raiſed againſt him, as cauſe of the barrenneſſe of the land; by the Inquiſitor, Friar <hi>Hannibal,</hi> a <hi>Griſon.</hi> For he knew not where to remaine with more dignity, nor to haue greater commoditie to iuſtifie himſelfe againſt the imputations of the Frair, who publiſhed him for a Lutheran, not onely in <hi>Iſtria,</hi> but before the <hi>Nuncio</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Pope. Whereof the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of the Councell beeing aduertiſed, ſuffered him not to bee preſent at the publique Actes, as a Prelate, if firſt hee were not iuſtified before the Pope, to whom they effectually exhorted him to goe; and if they had not feared to raiſe talke againſt the libertie of the Councell, they would haue gone beyond exhortation. This Biſhop, ſeeing hee was more diſgraced in <hi>Trent,</hi> departed a little after, with purpoſe to returne to his Biſhopricke, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the popular ſedition was appeaſed. But when he came to <hi>Venice,</hi> he was forbidden by the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> to goe thither, who had order from <hi>Rome</hi> to make his proceſſe; for diſdaine whereof, or for feare, or for ſome other cauſe, hee quitted <hi>Italie</hi> within a few moneths after. <note place="margin">Vergerius <hi>forſaketh</hi> Italie.</note>

The fifteenth day, the three draughts beeing propoſed, though euery one was maintayned by ſome, yet the third was approoued by the maior part. In the Congregations after, the Diuines diſcourſed vpon the other Articles, and in the third there was much difference about the Latine tranſlation of the Scripture, betweene ſome few who had good knowledge of the Latine, and ſome taſte of the Greeke, and others who were ignorant in the Tongues. Friar <hi>Aloiſius</hi> of <hi>Catanea,</hi> ſaid that, for reſolution of this article, nothing could <note place="margin">Diſcourſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin tranſlation</note> be brought more to the purpoſe, or more fit for the preſent times and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, then the indgement of Cardinall <hi>Caietane,</hi> a man very well read in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, hauing ſtudied it euen from a childe; who for the happineſſe of his wit, and for his laborious diligence, became the prime Diuine of that and many more ages, vnto whom there was no Prelate or perſon in the Councel who would not yeelde in learning, or thought himſelfe too good to learne of him. This Cardinall, going Legate into <hi>Germanie,</hi> in the yeere 1523. ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying exactly how thoſe that erred might be reduced to the Church, and the Arch-heretiques conuinced, found out the true remedy, which was the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall meaning of the text of the Scripture in the originall tongue in which it is written, and all the reſidue of his life, which was 11. yeeres, hee gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe onely to the ſtudy of the Scripture, expounding not the Latine tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Hebrew rootes of the old, and the Greeke of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In which tongues, hauing no knowledge himſelfe, he imployed men of vnderſtanding, who made conſtruction of the text vnto him word by word, as his workes vpon the holy bookes doe ſhew. That good Cardinall was wont to ſay, that to vnderſtand the Latine text, was not to vnderſtand the infallible word of God, but the word of the tranſlatour, ſubiect and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious vnto errors. That <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpake well, that to propheſie and write holy bookes proceeded from the holy Ghoſt, but to tranſlate them into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongue, was a worke of humane skill. And hee complayned and ſaid; Would to God the Doctors of the former age had done ſo, and then the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therane hereſie would neuer haue found place. Hee added that no tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could bee approued without reiecting the Canon, <hi>Vt veterum, d. 9.</hi> which commandeth to haue the Hebrew text to examine the relitie of the bookes of the old Teſtament, and the Greeke for a direction in thoſe of the new. To approoue a tranſlation as authenticall, was to condemne S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and all thoſe who haue tranſlated. If any be authenticall, to what end ſerue the reſt which are not? it would bee a great vanitie to produce vncertaine copies, when there are ſome infallible. That they ſhould bee of the opinion of 9. <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Caietane,</hi> that euery Interpreter may erre, though he haue vſed all arte not to vary from the originall. But ſure it is, that if the holy Councell ſhould examine, or correct an interpretation according to the true text, the holy Ghoſt, which aſſiſteth Synods in matters of faith, would keepe them from erring; and ſuch a tranſlation, ſo examined and approoued, might bee called authenticall. But that any could be approoued without ſuch an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, with aſſurance of the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, hee durſt not ſay, except the Synode did determine it, ſeeing that in the Councel of the holy Apoſtles a great inquiſition was made before. But this beeing a worke of tenne yeeres, and impoſſible to be vndertaken, it ſeemed better to leaue things
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:17208:88"/>
as they had remained 1500. yeeres, that the Latine tranſlations ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the originall Texts.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the maior part of the Diuines ſaid, that it was neceſſary to account that tranſlation, which formerly hath beene read in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and vſed in the ſchooles, to be diuine and authenticall; otherwiſe they ſhould yeeld the cauſe to the Lutherans, and open a gate to innumerable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies hereafter, and continually trouble the peace of Chriſtendome. That the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> mother and miſtreſſe of all the reſt, is, in a great part, founded by the Popes, and by ſchoole Diuines, vpon ſome paſſage of the Scripture, which if euery one had liberty to examine whether it were well tranſlated, running to other tranſlations, or ſeeking how it was in the Greeke or Hebrew, theſe new Grammarians would confound all, and would be made Iudges and arbiters of faith: and in ſtead of Diuines and Canoniſts, Pedanties ſhould be preferred to be Biſhops and Cardinals. The Inquiſitors will not be able to proceede againſt the Lutherans, in caſe they know not Hebrew and Greeke, becauſe they will ſuddenly anſwere, the text is not ſo, and that the tranſlation is falſe: and euery nouity, or toy, that ſhall come into the head of any Grammarian, either for malice, or want of knowledge in Diuinity, ſo that he may but finde ſome grammaticall tricke in thoſe tongues to confirme it, will be ſufficient to ground himſelfe thereon, and he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer make an end. That it doth appeare, ſince <hi>Luther</hi> began to tranſlate the Scripture, how many diuers and contrary tranſlations haue ſeene the light, which deſerue to bee buried in perpetuall darkeneſſe, and how often <hi>Martin</hi> himſelfe hath changed his owne tranſlation; that neuer any hath beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed without ſome notable change, not of one or two paſſages, but of an hundred in a breath: that if this libertie bee giuen to all, Chriſtianitie will ſoone be brought to that paſſe that no man will know what to beleeue.</p>
            <p>To theſe reaſons, which the maior part applauded, others added alſo, that if the prouidence of God hath giuen an authenticall Scripture to the Synagogue, and an authenticall New Teſtament to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> it cannot be ſaid, without derogation, that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> more beloued then the reſt, hath wanted this great benefit, and therefore that the ſame holy Ghoſt, who did dictate the holy bookes, hath dictated alſo that tranſlation which ought to be accepted by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Some thought it hard to make a Prophet or Apoſtle onely to tranſlate a booke; therefore they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated the aſſertion, and ſaid, that he had not a Prophericall or Apoſtolicall Spirit, but one very neere. And if any ſhould make dainty to giue the ſpirit of God to the Interpreter, yet he cannot deny it to the Councell; and when the vulgar edition ſhall bee approued, and an anathema thundered againſt whoſoeuer will not receiue it: this will be without error, not by the ſpirit of him that wrote it, but of the Synode that hath receiued it for ſuch.</p>

               <hi>D. Iſidorus Clarus,</hi> a <hi>Breſcian,</hi> and a Benedictine Abbat, a man well ſeene in this ſtudie, went about to remooue this opinion by an hiſtoricall narrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſaid in ſubſtance, that in the Primitiue Church there were many Greeke tranſlations of the Old Teſtament, which <hi>Origen</hi> gathered into one volume, confornting them in ſixe columnes; the chiefe of theſe is called of the <hi>Septuagint;</hi> from whence diuers in Latine were taken: and many were
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17208:88"/>
taken from the Greeke text of the new Teſtament, one of which, moſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and read in the Church, and eſteemed the beſt by Saint <hi>Auſtin;</hi> is called <hi>Itala;</hi> yet ſo as that the Greeke text ought vndoubtedly to bee prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> a man (as all doe know) skilfull in the knowledge of tongues, ſeeing that of the olde Teſtament to ſwarue from the Hebrew trueth; by the fault partly of the Greeke interpreter, and partly of the Latin, made one immediately out of the Hebrew, and amended that of the new Teſtament according to the trueth of the Greeke text. <hi>Hieroms</hi> credit made his tranſlation to bee receiued by many; but was reiected by ſome, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they loued more the errours of antiquitie, then new trueths, or, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe complaineth by reaſon of emulation. But a few yeeres after, when enuie was laid aſide, that of S. <hi>Hierom</hi> was receiued by all the Latins; &amp; ſo they were both in vſe, one being called the olde, and the other the new. Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> writing to <hi>Leander</hi> vpon <hi>Iob,</hi> teſtifieth that the Apoſtolike Sea vſeth them both, and that himſelfe, in the expoſition of that booke made choice to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the new, as conformable to the Hebrew text: yet in the allegations he would vſe ſometimes one, ſometimes another, as it beſt befitted his purpoſe. The times following, by the vſe of them both, compoſed one; taking part of the new, and part of the olde, according as the accidents required, and to this the name of the vulgar Edition was giuen. The Pſalmes were all of the olde; becauſe, being dayly ſung in the Churches, they could not be changed. The leſſer Prophets are all of the new, &amp; the greater mixt of both. This is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true that all hath happened by the ordinance of God, without which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſucceede. But yet it cannot be ſaid that there was in it greater knowledge then humane. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith plainely that no interpreter <note place="margin">S. <hi>Ierom</hi> ſaith that no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter hath ſpoken by the holy Ghoſt.</note> hath ſpoken by the holy Ghoſt. The Edition which wee haue is his for the moſt part: it would bee ſtrange to attribute the aſſiſtance of God to him that knoweth and affirmeth hee hath it not. Wherefore no tranſlation can bee compared to the text in the originall tongue. Therefore his opinion was that the vulgar edition ſhould bee preferred before all, and allowed, yet ſo as that it ſhould bee corrected by the originall, and all men forbid to make any other: only that ſhould be amended and the others extinguiſhed: and ſo all inconueniences cauſed by new interpretations, which haue iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly been noted, and reprehended in the Congregations, would ceaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andrew de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ega,</hi> a Franciſcan Friar, going as a Mediator betweene theſe two opinions, approoued that of Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> that the qualities of an interpreter are not any Propheticall, or other ſpeciall diuine ſpirit, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them infallibilitie, and the opinion of the ſame Saint, and of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to correct the tranſlations by the texts of the originall tongue. But added that it was not contrary to this to ſay withall, that the Latin Church holdeth the vulgar edition for authenticall, becauſe it is thus to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that concerning faith and manners there is no errour in it, though in ſome ſmall matter, or expreſſion of wordes there may be a miſtaking, it being impoſſible that all the words of one language ſhould bee tranſplanted into another, but that there will bee ſome reſtriction or inlargement of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications or metaphore, or other figure. That the vulgar edition hath beene examined heeretofore by the whole Church during the ſpace of 1000.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:17208:89"/>
yeeres, and knowne that there is no errour in it, in matter of faith or manners; and in this account it hath beene held and vſed by the ancient Councels, and ſo ought ſtill to bee held and approoued, and declared as authenticall, that is, that it may bee read without danger, not hindering thoſe that are more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to haue recourſe vnto the Hebrew and Greeke originals, but forbidding ſo great a number of whole tranſlations, which beget confuſion.</p>
            <p>About the Article of the ſenſe of the holy Scripture, the doctrine of Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> gaue occaſion to ſpeake diuerſly; who taught, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſame himſelfe, that new conceits, when they agree to the text, and <note place="margin">Diſcourſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Scripture.</note> are not aliene from other places of the Scripture, and doctrine of faith, are not to be reiected, though the ſtreame of the Doctors runne another way, in regard the Maieſtie of God hath not tied the ſenſe of the Scripture to the old Doctors: otherwiſe there would remaine no more power to thoſe that liue now, nor to poſteritie, then to tranſcribe the ſame things againe; which ſome of the Diuines and Fathers approoued, and ſome oppoſed.</p>
            <p>To the firſt it ſeemed a ſpirituall tyrannie to forbid the faithfull to make vſe of their proper ingenie, according to the grace which God hath giuen them: and that this was iuſt a prohibition to exerciſe the talent giuen vs by God. That men ought to bee inticed, with all allurements, to the reading of the holy writ, from which when that pleaſure, which nouitie bringeth, ſhall bee remooued, all men will euer abhorre it, and ſuch ſtrictneſſe will make men apply themſelues to other ſtudies, and abandon this, and by conſequence all ſtudie and care of pietie. That this varietie of ſpirituall gifts belongeth to the perfection of the Church, and is found amongſt the Fathers, in whoſe writings there is great diuerſitie, and oftentimes contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, yet ioyned with aſſured charitie. Why ſhould not that libertie bee graunted to this age which others haue inioyed with ſpirituall fruit? The Schoole-men though, in the doctrine of Theologie, they haue no diſputes about the meaning of the Scripture, yet they haue as many differences in points of religion, and no leſſe dangerous. That it is better to imitate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, which hath not reſtrained the expoſition of the Scripture, but left it free.</p>
            <p>Thoſe of the contrarie opinion ſayd, that popular licence being worſe then tyrannie, it was then fit to curbe the vnbrideled wits, otherwayes they could not hope to ſee an end of the preſent contentions. That anciently it was allowed to write vpon the holy Bookes, becauſe there was neede, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard there were but few expoſitions. And the men of thoſe times were of an holy life, and ſetled minde, from whom no confuſions could bee feared, as now. And therefore the Schoole-men, ſeeing there was no more neede of other expoſitions in the Church, and that the Scripture was not onely ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, but aboundantly declared, they tooke another courſe to treate of holy myſteries; and ſeeing that men were inclined to diſputings they thought good to buſie them rather in examining of the reaſons &amp; ſayings of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to keepe the holy Scripture in reuerence; from which much is derogated, when it is handled after a common faſhion, and is the ſubiect of the Studies and exerciſes of curious men. And this opinion went on ſo farre, that <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Mans,</hi> a Franciſcan Friar, ſayd that the doctrines of faith were now ſo
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17208:89"/>
cleered, that wee ought no more to learne them out of Scripture: which, it is true, was read heretofore in the Church for inſtruction of the people, whereas now it is read in the Church onely to pray, and ought to ſerue eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one for this end onely, and not to ſtudie. And this ſhould be the reuerence and worſhip due from euery one to the word of God. But, at the leaſt, the ſtudying of it ſhould bee prohibited to euery one that is not firſt confirmed in ſchoole Diuinitie; neither doe the Lutherans gaine vpon any but thoſe that ſtudie the Scripture. Which opinion wanted not adherents.</p>
            <p>Betweene theſe opinions there went two others in the middle: One, that it was not good to reſtraine the vnderſtanding of the Scripture, to the Fathers onely, in regard their expoſitions are allegoricall for the moſt part, and ſeldome literall; and thoſe that follow the letter, fit themſelues to their owne time, ſo that, the expoſition agreeth not to our age. That Cardinall <note place="margin">The opinion of <hi>Cuſanus;</hi> that the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Scripture muſt be fitte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to the time.</note> 
               <hi>Cuſanus,</hi> a man excellently learned and honeſt, ſaid iudicially, that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Scripture muſt bee fitted to the time, and expounded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the current Rites: and that it is not to bee maruciled at, if the Church in one time expoundeth in one faſhion, at another in another. And this was the meaning of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, when it decreed that the Scripture ſhould bee expounded according to the Doctors of the Church, or as long vſe hath approoued, that new expoſitions ſhould not bee forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but when they varie from the common ſenſe.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> a Dominican Friar, diſtinguiſhed the matter of faith and manners from the others, ſaying, it was meete in that onely to keepe eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wit within limits, but in others it was not inconuenient to let euery one, ſo that pietie and charitie bee preſerued, to abound in his owne ſence. That the Fathers deſired not to bee followed of neceſſitie, but onely in things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to beleeue and to doe. Neither did the Popes; when in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretals they expounded ſome paſſage of the Scripture in one ſenſe, meane to canonize that, ſo that it ſhould not bee lawfull to vnderſtand it otherwiſe, though with reaſon. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> ment ſo, when hee ſaid, that prophecying, that is, interpretation of the Scripture, ſhould bee vſed according to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of faith, that is, with reference to the Articles thereof. And if this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction were not made, they muſt needes fall into notable inconueniences, by reaſon of the contrarieties which are found in the diuers expoſitions of the ancient Fathers, which doe oppugne one another.</p>
            <p>The difficulties were not ſo great, but that the vulgar edition was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, <note place="margin">The vulgar edition is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued.</note> almoſt by a generall conſent, the diſcourſe hauing made deepe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in their mindes, that Grammarians would take vpon them to teach Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Diuines. Some few thought it fit, in regard of the reaſons brought by the Diuines, to leaue the point for that time, but ſeeing the reſolution was otherwiſe, they deſired them to conſider, that hauing approued it, they ſhould command it to be printed and corrected, and in that caſe, that it was neceſſary to frame a copie by which to make the impreſſion. Whereupon ſixe were deputed by common conſent, and commanded to be diligent in making that correction, that it might bee publiſhed before the end of the Councell, reſeruing power to themſelues to augment the number, if amongſt thoſe that were to come, any were fit for the worke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:17208:90"/>
But in giuing voyces vpon the fourth Article, after Cardinall, <hi>Pacceco</hi> had ſaid, that the Scripture was expounded by ſo many and ſo excellent men in goodneſſe and learning, that there was no hope to adde any good thing more, and that all the new hereſies ſprang from the new expoſitions of the Scripture, and therefore that it was neceſſary to bridle the ſaucineſſe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne wits, and to make them content to be gouerned by the ancients, and by the Church, and that if any had ſome ſingular ſpirit, he ſhould be enforced to conceale it, and not to confound the world by publiſhing it, almoſt all runne into the ſame opinion.</p>
            <p>The Congregation of the 29. was all ſpent in the fift Article. For the Diuines hauing ſpoken irreſolutely, and with reference to the Synod, to which it belongeth to make Statutes, the Fathers were doubtfull alſo. To leaue out the Anathema wholly, was to make no decree of faith, and in the very beginning to breake the order ſet downe, to handle the two heads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. To condemne euery one for an heretike who would not accept the vulgar Edition in ſome particular place, perhaps of none importance, or ſhould publiſh ſome inuention of his owne vpon the Scripture, through va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of minde, ſeemed too rigorous. After long diſcuſſion they found a temper, which was to frame the firſt Decree, and comprehend in it that onely which concerneth the Catalogue of the holy Bookes, and the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to conclude that with an anathema. Then in the ſecond, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to reformation, to comprehend the tranſlation and ſenſe of the Scripture, as if the Decree were a remedie againſt the abuſe of ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, and impertinent expoſitions.</p>
            <p>It remayned to ſpeake of the other abuſes, of which euery one had colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <note place="margin">The abuſes are ſpoken of.</note> a great number, and many wayes to redreſſe them, as humane weakneſſe and ſuperſtition vſeth holy things, not onely beyond, but alſo contrary to that for which they are appointed. Of inchantments to find treaſures, and to bring laſciuious deſeignes to paſſe, or to obtaine things vnlawfull, much was ſaid, and many remedies propoſed to roote them out. Amongſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments ſome put, carying the Goſpel about one; names of God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent infirmities, or to be healed of them, or to bee kept from euils and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes, or to bee proſperous; likewiſe to reade them for the ſame ends, and to write them with obſeruation of times. In this catalogue were numbred Maſſes, ſaid in ſome Countries vpon red hot Iron, vpon boyling waters, or vpon cold, or other matters for vulgar purgations; to recite the Goſpel ouer Armes, that they may haue more force againſt the enemies. In this ranke were put the coniurations of dogges to make them not bite, of ſerpents to make them not offend, of harmefull beaſts in the field, of tempeſts, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſes of the barrenneſſe of the land, requiring that all theſe obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might bee condemned, forbid, and puniſhed as abuſes. But in diuers particulars there were contradictions and diſputes. For ſome defended as things deuout and religious, or, at the leaſt, permitted, and not damnable, which others did condemne for wicked and ſuperſtitious. The like happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſpeaking of the Word of God by caſting of lots, or diuinations, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting ſchedules with verſes of the Scripture, or obſeruing thoſe they met, when they opened the booke. To vſe ſacred words in ſcandalous libels, and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17208:90"/>
other detractions, was generally condemned, and much was ſayd of the meanes how to remooue the <hi>Paſquins</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> wherein the Cardinall of <hi>Monte</hi> ſhewed great paſſion in deſiring a remedie, becauſe he was often made a ſubiect of the ſaucineſſe of the Courtiers tongues, by reaſon of his naturall liberty and pleaſantneſſe of wit. All agreed, that the Word of God could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee reuerenced enough, and that to vſe it to mens commendations, though Princes and Prelates, is not ſeemely, and generally that all vaine vſe of it is a ſinne. But yet the Councell ought not to buſie it ſelfe in this, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they were not aſſembled to prouide againſt all faults; neither was it to beforbid abſolutely, to draw the words of the Scripture to humane matters, becauſe S. <hi>Antoninus,</hi> in his ſtorie, condemned not the Sicilian Ambaſſadors, who, asking pardon of <hi>Martin</hi> the fourth, deliuered their Ambaſſage in no other termes, but ſaying three times, <hi>Agnus Dei qui tollis peccata mundi, miſerere nobis.</hi> Nor the Popes anſwere who likewiſe ſaid thriſe, <hi>Aue Rex Iudeorum, Et dabant illi alapas.</hi> Therefore that it was the malice of the Lutherans to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto,</hi> who in his ſermon made in the publike Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaid that to him that refuſed the Councel, it might bee replied, <hi>Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Of the abuſes of the Prints there was not much to be ſpoken; for all agreed that the Printers ſhould bee brideled, and prohibited to Print any ſacred thing before it was allowed; but for this the Decree of the laſt <hi>Lateran</hi> Councel was ſufficient.</p>
            <p>But about readings and preachings there were terrible controuerſies. <note place="margin">A great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Regulars and Prelats, about readings and preachings.</note> The Regulars beeing already in poſſeſſion of them, as well by the Popes priuiledges, as by the practiſe of 300 yeeres, laboured to preſerue them with all their might: and the Prelates alledging that they belonged to them, and were vſurped, pretended reſtitution. And becauſe the contention was heere, not of opinions, but of profit, they vſed on both ſides not onely reaſons, but deedes alſo. Which differences were ſet on foote that at the time of the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing might be decided. Therefore the Legates reſolued, to deferre theſe two points vntill another Seſſion. Two Decrees were framed, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly was reſolued, and were read in the laſt Congregation, and approoued; yet with ſome exceptions in the point of the vulgar Edition. In the ende heereof the Cardinall of <hi>Monte,</hi> after hee had commended the learning and wiſedome of them all, admoniſhed them of the ſeemely behauiour which was fit to vſe in the publique Seſſion, ſhewing one heart, and one minde, in regard the points were ſufficiently examined in the Congregations: and the Congregation beeing ended, the Cardinall <hi>Santa Croce</hi> aſſembled thoſe that had oppoſed the vulgar Edition, and ſhewed they could not complaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not prohibited but left free to correct it, and to haue recourſe to <note place="margin">No errors of faith in the vulgar Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the originall; but that onely it was forbid to ſay there were in it errors of faith, for which it ought to be reiected.</p>

The eight of April, appoynted for the Seſſion, being come, the Maſſe of the holy Ghoſt was ſaid by <hi>Saluator Alepus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Torre</hi> in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and the Sermon was made by Friar <hi>Auſtin</hi> of <hi>Aretium,</hi> Generall of the <hi>Serui,</hi> the Pontificall habiliments put on, the accuſtomed letanies and prayers made, and the Decrees read by the Archbiſhop that ſaid Maſſe.

That they imbraced him with all their heart, and did admit, as farre as they could with reaſon, the mandates of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> That they were ſorry for the indiſpoſition of his Colleague, and thanked God for the peace betweene the Pope and the Emperour, praying him to fauour the deſires of them both, for the increaſe of Chriſtian religion, and peace of the Church. Theſe things being done, with the vſuall ceremonies, the Seſſion ended; the Decrees whereof were ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> by the Legates, and a little after printed.</p>
            <p>But after they were ſeene, eſpecially in <hi>Germany,</hi> they miniſtred great <note place="margin">A few Prelats and not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, do decide the greateſt points of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> matter of diſcourſe. Some thought it ſtrange that fiue Cardinals, and 48. biſhops, ſhould ſo eaſily define the moſt principall and important points of Religion, neuer decided before, giuing Canonicall authoritie to Bookes held for vncertaine and apocryphall, making authenticall a tranſlation diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the original, preſcribing and reſtraining the manner to vnderſtand the word of God; neither was there amongſt theſe Prelates any one remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for learning; ſome of them were Lawyers, perhaps learned in that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but of little vnderſtanding in Religion; few Diuines, but of leſſe then ordinary ſufficiencie; the greater number Gentlemen or Courtiers; and for their dignities ſome were onely titular, and the maior part Biſhops of ſo ſmall Cities, that ſuppoſing euery one to repreſent his people, it could not be ſaid that one of a thouſand in Chriſtendome was repreſented. But par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of <hi>Germany</hi> there was not ſo much as one biſhop or Diuine. Was it poſſible that amongſt ſo many no man ſhould be ſent! Why did not the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour cauſe ſome of them to goe, who aſſiſted in the Colloquie, and were informed in the differencies? Amongſt the Prelats of <hi>Germany</hi> onely the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Auſburg</hi> had ſent a Proctor, and him a Sauoyard. For the Proctors of the Cardinall and Elector of <hi>Ments,</hi> vnderſtanding their maſters death, went away two moneths before.</p>
            <p>Others ſaid, that the things decided were not of ſo great moment as they <note place="margin">Nothing is certainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> ſeemed. For the point of traditions, which ſeemed moſt important, was of no conſequence. Firſt becauſe it was nothing to ordain they ſhould be receiued, if it were not declared which they were, &amp; how they ſhould be knowen: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe there was no commandement to receiue them, but onely a prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to contemne them wittingly and deliberately. So that he that reiected them with reuerend termes, contradicted not; and the rather, becauſe there is an example of the adherents of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who receiue not the ordination of Deaconeſſes, graunt not to the people the election of the Miniſter, which certainely was an Apoſtolical inſtitution, continued more then eight hundred yeeres, and which more importeth, obſerue not the communion of the Chalice, Inſtituted by Chriſt, preached by the Apoſtles, obſerued by the whole Church, vntill within two hundred yeeres, and now alſo by all Chriſtian Nations but the Latine; that if this be not a tradition, it is impoſſible to ſhew whatother is. And for the vulgar edition declared au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticall,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17208:92"/>
nothing at all was done, becauſe among ſo many copies, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be knowen which is the true. But this laſt oppoſition was made, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the deputation to make a corrected copie of the vulgar edition, was not knowen. The which, for what cauſe it was not effected, ſhall be ſaid in its place.</p>
            <p>But the Decrees of the Seſſion being ſeene in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the importance <note place="margin">Nor concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar edition.</note> of the things treated of conſidered, the Pope began to thinke he ought more to regard the buſineſſe of the Councell, then vntill that time hee had done; and he enlarged the congregation of Cardinals and Prelats, who were to conſider of the occurrences of the Synode, and to relate them. By the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of theſe, after their firſt aſſembling, he admoniſhed the Legats of three things. One not to publiſh hereafter in Seſſion any decree, before they had communicated it at <hi>Rome,</hi> and to auoyd too much ſlowneſſe in proceeding, <note place="margin">The Pope ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth the Legates of three things.</note> but to beware much more of two much celeritie, which might make them reſolue of ſome indigeſted matter, and want time to receiue orders from him, what they ſhould propoſe, deliberate, and conclude. The ſecond; not to ſpend time in matters not controuerſed, as they had done in thoſe that were handled for the laſt ſeſſion; wherein all agree, that they are vndoubted principles. The third, to take heede, that by no meanes the Popes authoritie be diſputed on.</p>
            <p>Whereunto they readily anſwered that they would obey his Holineſſe <note place="margin">To whom the Legates make a ready an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> commandement; but that it ſeemed to them, that in the things defined, there is ſmall difference betweene Catholiques and Heretiques, and that ſome of the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, receiued by the third Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> by <hi>Innocentius</hi> the firſt, by <hi>Gelatius,</hi> by the ſixt Synod of <hi>Trullus,</hi> and the Florentine Councell are called into queſtion by the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, and which is worſe, by ſome Catholikes and Cardinals, and alſo that the vnwritten Traditions are impugned by the Lutherans, who intend nothing more then to annihilate them, declaring that all things neceſſary to ſaluation, are written. And therefore though theſe two heads bee princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, yet they are the moſt controuerſed concluſions which are to bee deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Councell, and of the greateſt importance. They added that vntill then there was no occaſion to ſpeake of the Popes authoritie, or of the Councell, but in treading of the title, when the addition of <hi>Repreſentation of the vniuerſall Church</hi> was required. That many deſire it ſtill, but that they will auoyd it as much as poſſibly they can. And in caſe they ſhall be brought to it by force, they will deſire (thinking it will not bee denyed them) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the manner how it doth repreſent, that is, by meanes of the head, and not otherwiſe; whereby there will bee rather gaine then loſſe. For the reſt becauſe they think the maior part will alwayes beare al reuerence to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, being vnited, as Head, with the bodie of the Councell, (which will be ſo long, as they ſhall agree in the reformation) hee may ſet his heart at reſt that his authoritie ſhall not be queſtioned.</p>
            <p>After this the Pope ſent <hi>Ieronimo Franco Nuncio</hi> to the Swiſſes, giuing him <note place="margin">The Pope ſendeth a <hi>Nuncio</hi> to the <hi>Swiſſes.</hi>
               </note> letters to the Biſhops of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Coira,</hi> to the Abbat of <hi>S. Gallo,</hi> and other Abbats of thoſe Nations; to whom hee wrote, that, hauing called all the Prelates of Chriſtendome to the Generall Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> it was fit that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17208:92"/>
they, who repreſent the Heluetian Church, ſhould aſſiſt alſo, in regard hee much loued that nation, as eſpeciall ſonnes of the Apoſtolike Sea, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of the Eccleſiaſticall libertie. That Prelates out of <hi>Italie, France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> were arriued alreadie, and the number increaſed dayly. That it was not ſeemely that they, being borderers, ſhould bee preuented by thoſe that dwelt further off. That their Countrey was infected with hereſies, and therefore had more need of a Councell. In fine hee commanded them, vpon their allegiance and oath, and paines preſcribed by the lawes, to goe thither as ſoone as was poſſible; referring the reſt to bee tolde them by his <hi>Nuncio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And at the many inſtances of the Clergie and Vniuerſitie of <hi>Collen,</hi> aſſiſted <note place="margin">And giueth ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Collen.</hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trect,</hi> and Vniuerſitie of <hi>Louaine,</hi> he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſentence againſt the Arch-biſhop and Elector of <hi>Collen,</hi> declaring him excommunicated, depriuing him of all benefices and priuiledges Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, abſoluing his ſubiects from their oath of fidelitie, and commanding them not to obey him, becauſe he had incurred the cenſures of the Bull of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, publiſhed againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and his adherents, as hauing held, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and publiſhed that doctrine againſt the Eccleſiaſticall rules; traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Apoſtles, and vſuall rites of Chriſtian religion. And the ſentence <note place="margin">The Pope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Bull in fauour of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus.</hi>
               </note> was after printed in <hi>Rome.</hi> He made alſo another Bull, giuing order that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi> Count of <hi>Scauemburg,</hi> aſſumed before by the Arch-biſhop for his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adiutor, ſhould be obeyed.</p>
            <p>And hee earneſtly deſired the Emperour, that the ſentence might be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted; <note place="margin">The Emperor will not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Popes ſentence.</note> who thought not this nouitie fit for his purpoſe, becauſe it would make the Arch-biſhop, who vntill then had abſolutely obeyed him, to vnite himſelfe with thoſe that were combined againſt him. And therefore he held him ſtill for an Arch-biſhop and treated with him, and wrote to him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard of the popes ſentence. This vexed the Pope at the heart, but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this ſentence.</note> there was no remedie, hee thought it follie to complaint in vaine. That ſentence produced another bad effect, becauſe the Proteſtants tooke occaſion to confirme their opinion that the Councell was intimated only to inſnare them. For if the controuerſed doctrine of faith ought to bee examined in the Councell, how could the Pope, before the definition thereof, proceede to ſentence, and condemne the Arch biſhop of hereſie? Therefore it appeareth that in vaine they ſhould goe to that Councell, where the Pope dominee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, who cannot diſſemble, though hee would, that hee eſteemeth them as men condemned. That it was manifeſt alſo that the Pope made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Councell, becauſe, after it was begun, hee proceeded defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely in that which belongeth to the Councel, without imparting any thing vnto it. The Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> ſignified this to the Emperour by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, and after ſayde vnto him, that the Popes minde being now made manifeſt, it would bee high time to prouide for <hi>Germany,</hi> by a Nationall Councell, or by handling ſeioruſly, the points of Religion in a Diet.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the buſineſſe of the Councell there remained (as hath beene ſayde) as remnants of the things, handled before in the laſt Seſsion, the two points, to prouide for the Lectures of the holy Scripture, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17208:93"/>
of the word of God. For this was handled in the firſt Congregation; and (to begin the matter of faith) it was propoſed to treat likewiſe of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſin. Wherunto the Spaniſh Prelats oppoſed, and ſayd, that to prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the abuſes of preaching &amp; reading, was matter enough for one ſeſſion. Which opinion alſo was followed by the Italian Prelates who were on the Emperors ſide. And the Legats thought they had diſcouered that this was plotted by <hi>Caeſars</hi> miniſters, who at the very inſtant had ſeriouſly treated with thoſe Prelats. Therfor they ſent aduice thereof to the Pope, from whom they had anſwere, that they ſhould take heed to go on warily, vntil he were able to giue them a reſolution. Therefore they vſed artificiall diligence, entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelues with part of the Abuſes, without comming to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them, and without making demonſtration whether they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in the matter of originall ſinne. And thus the caſe ſtoode vntil Eaſter.</p>
            <p>Which being paſt, the Pope wrote they ſhould proceede, and propoſe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Don Francis</hi> of <hi>Toledo</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth that the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhould be handled without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> that matter. This being deliuered the ſecond of May, came to the know ledge of <hi>Don Francis;</hi> who going to viſite the Legats vſed much arte, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times making ſhew to giue them counſell, ſometimes propoſing his opinion for the proſecuting of the reformation onely, to know their mindes, and to perſwade them obliquely to embrace his deſeigne. But ſeeing that did no good, hee began to ſpeake as plainely as was needfull, that hee had letters from the Emperour, by which hee was charged to be a meanes that they ſhould not enter into the points of doctrine, but ſhould handle the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only. The Legats brought many reaſons to the contrary; &amp; amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they ſaid, they could not doe it without contradicting the Popes Buls, which propoſed theſe two things together; and that which was eſtabliſhed in the Councell, that they ſhould goe forward cheeke by iowle; adding, that they had written to his Holineſſe, that they would begin eight dayes after Eaſter. Diuers diſcourſes and replyes were made on both ſides, and in concluſion the Legats ſaid they were commanded by the Pope, and could not be wanting to their duetie. <hi>Don Francis</hi> ſayd, it was the dutie of good miniſters to maintaine amitie betweene Princes, and ſometimes to expect the ſecond Commiſſion. This was not denyed by the Legates; but they anſwered that more was not to be expected from them then they were able to doe with their honour. They gaue the Pope an account of all this, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the Cardinall of <hi>Trent</hi> told them, that if the Article of originall ſing were propoſed, the Emperor would be diſcontented; and therefore on the one ſide being deſirous to make peace and concord, and on the other to obey his Holineſſe commandements, they thought good to ſend away this aduiſe in diligence, beſeeching him not to let them erre; adding that if no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduiſe came, they would follow his laſt commandement, and would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to perſwade <hi>Don Francis</hi> and the Cardinall of <hi>Trent,</hi> that this Article of originall ſinne was no more queſtioned in <hi>Germany,</hi> but accorded, as was manifeſt by the laſt Colloquie of <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> where his Maieſtie for the firſt Article to bee accorded, cauſed that of iuſtification to be taken. But to giue as much more time as is poſſible, they will entertaine themſelues, as many dayes as they honeſtly can, in diſpatching that which remaineth of the laſt Seſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:17208:93"/>
A Congregation was made for this onely, to giue a better forme how they ſhould more orderly proceede then they formerly had done, as well in handling the doctrine of faith, as the matter of reformation. And they diſtinguiſhed two ſorts of Congregations, one for Diuines, to diſcourſe on the matter of faith which ſhould be propoſed, whoſe opinions ſhould bee written by one of the Notaries of the Councel, to whom ſhould bee added <note place="margin">A forme to proceed in Councell is ſet downe.</note> Canoniſts, when reformation was ſpoken of: (which Congregations were to bee held in the preſence of the Legates, in which any of the Fathers that would might be preſent.) Another ſort of Congregations ſhould conſiſt of Prelates to frame the heads of Doctrine and reformation, which, beeing examined, and ſet in order, according to the moſt common opinion, ſhould be propoſed in the generall Congregation, to vnderſtand euery ones voyce that by the determination of the maior part, the decrees might be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, which are to be publiſhed in the Seſſion.</p>
            <p>According to this order, they treated of Lectures and Sermons, framing <note place="margin">The diff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

But on the other ſide, the Legates deſired to maintaine the priuiledges giuen by the Pope, eſpecially to the Mendicants and Vniuerſities. And after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſputes, when the matter was ſufficiently debated, they thought that, in the Congregation of the tenth of May, all would agree. But it prooued to the contrary, for though it laſted till night, yet in ſome points, they could come to no concluſion, for the diuerſitie of opinions amongſt the Prelats themſelues, and in others, becauſe the Legates would not yeelde to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall opinion, to remooue, or at the leaſt, to moderate the priuiledges. They alledged againſt the Biſhops, that they were more moued by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per intereſt, then by reaſon; that they made none account to preiudice the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars; that they were too bold in correcting the former Councels, &amp; in med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the priuiledges granted by the Pope. And they could not agree, not onely for the varietie of Opinions and intereſts of the Biſhops, but alſo becauſe the Imperialiſts did endeauour to make a difference, to hinder the propoſing of the points of Doctrine Neither was this temporizing vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Legates, who were reſolute, if they were not forbid in the anſwer, which they expected from <hi>Rome,</hi> to propoſe the doctrines, and, as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward friends ſayde, to cleere themſelues afterwards of whatſoeuer ſhould enſue.</p>
            <p>But to make ſome end of the things handled, they cauſed a briefe of the opinions of the Diuines and Canoniſts, deliuered in diuers preceding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, to be read; ſaying, that in regard the voyces were long, they had collected the ſumme of them, that they may examine them, and ſpeake their opinions thereon. But <hi>Bracius Martellus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Fieſole,</hi> hearing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract read, oppoſed it in a continued ſpeech, and ſaid it was neceſſary that the <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Fieſole</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates.</note> generall Congregation ſhould know the voyces and reaſons of all, without reading collections and ſummes; and inlarged himſelfe by amplifying the authoritie of the Councel, &amp; the neceſſity to informe it wel, &amp; the ſmal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencie, that ſome few ſhould be Iudges of the determinations, or that the

reſolutions ſhould come from any other place: whereat the Legates were much offended, and reprehended the Biſhop with affected modeſty, but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly enough. And ſo the Congregation brake vp.</p>
            <p>The next day the Legats ſent to the B. to demand a copie of his diſcourſe, and ſent it to <hi>Rome,</hi> taxing it as irreuerent and ſeditious; adding, that they had modeſtly and ſeuerely reprehended him, and would haue gone further <note place="margin">Who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine to the Pope both of him, and of the Biſhop of <hi>Chioza.</hi>
               </note> (becauſe he deſerued no leſſe) but that they feared to mooue ſome vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable diſpute, which might make a rent; But that he ought not to eſcape vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, leaſt he ſhould be emboldened to do the like in euery congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or worſe: repreſenting to his Holineſſe, that by all meanes he ſhould bee chaſed out of <hi>Trent,</hi> and order taken that the Biſhop of <hi>Chioza,</hi> (not much vnlike vnto him, though in another courſe) ſhould neuer returne. This Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop parted immediatly after the ſeſſion, vpon pretence of indiſpoſition, but in trueth by reaſon of wordes which paſſed betweene him and Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> in Congregation, in the matter of traditions. For hauing ſpoken in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Fryar <hi>Antonius Marinarus,</hi> and thereupon conteſted with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, and ſo hauing complained that the Councell was not free, he ſaw, he was not in the Legats fauour, and obnoxious to danger. The Legats not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with what they had done, to mortifie the Biſhop of <hi>Fieſole,</hi> and to keep the matter intire vntill there came aduiſe from <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might goe on with it, or diſſemble, as they ſhould be commanded, in the next Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Monte</hi> gaue him a nip by the way, and concluded that he left him then to conſider of his owne affaires, becauſe himſelfe was to be imployed in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of greater importance.</p>
            <p>The Pope anſwered concerning the two Biſhops, that he would giue a remedie in time conuenient. But for the matters to be handled, he ſayd, that <note place="margin">The Popes anſwere to the Legates.</note> if they regarded the deſires of Princes, they would make the Councel more tumultuous, and the reſolutions more long and hard, becauſe euery one ſought to croſſe what liked him not and by putting difficultie in one thing, to promote another. Therefore that without any more to doe, they ſhould begin with originall ſinne, aduiſing them to omit the excuſe which they purpoſed to vſe to D. <hi>Francis,</hi> that is that the article of originall ſinne is not queſtioned in <hi>Germany;</hi> but ſhould rather vſe generall termes, and all reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Emperour.</p>

            <p>In treating of the Lectures and Sermons, there was a generall complaint
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17208:94"/>
of the Biſhops, eſpecially Spaniſh; that, CHRIST hauing commanded that his doctrine ſhould be taught, which is exerciſed in the Church by preaching and reading to the more capacious, that they may be fit to teach the people, the care to ſuperintend, ouer all that exerciſe theſe functions, ought to bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Biſhop. That the Apoſtles haue ſo inſtituted, and the holy Fathers ſo practiſed. That now this office is abſolutely taken from the Biſhops by <note place="margin">A complaint againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular orders.</note> priuiledges, ſo that no iot thereof remaineth. That this is the cauſe why all is out of order, becauſe the order inſtituted by CHRIST is changed. The Vniuerſities are withdrawen with exemptions, that the Biſhop cannot know what they teach; the Sermons are by priuiledge giuen to the Friars, who by no meanes acknowledge the Biſhop, nor ſuffer him to meddle: ſo that the office of a Paſtour is quite taken from the Biſhops. And on the contrary; thoſe who anciently were appointed to weepe for ſinnes, and expreſſely and ſeuerely forbid to preach and teach, haue aſſumed this power vnto them, or, at the leaſt, it is giuen them for their proper function. And ſo the flocke remaineth without either ſhepheard or hireling, becauſe theſe ambulatorie Preachers, who to day are in one Citie, to morrow in another, know neither the need, nor the capacitie of the people, and leaſt of all the occaſions to teach and edifie them, as doth the proper Paſtour, who liueth alwayes with the flocke and knoweth the neceſſities and infirmities of it. Beſides the ende of thoſe Preachers, is not to edifie; but to take almes either for themſelues or their Cloiſters; which that they may the better obtaine, they ayme not to benefit the ſoule, but to delight the care, and ſoothe men in their pleaſures, that thereby they may draw more profit; and the people, in ſtead of learning the doctrine of CHRIST, learneth either nouitie, or vanitie at the leaſt. <hi>Luther</hi> was one of theſe; who if hee had remained weeping in his Cell, the Church of CHRIST had not ſtood in theſe termes. That the abuſe of the Pardoners was more manifeſt, who goe about preaching Indulgences, whoſe ſcandals, formerly giuen, cannot bee related without teares. That it is a cleere caſe, that they exhort the people to nothing but to giue money. The onely remedie for theſe diſorders, is to take away all the priuiledges, and to reſtore to the Biſhops, the charge to teach and preach, and to elect thoſe for their fellow labourers whom they ſhall know worthy of that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, and diſpoſed to exerciſe it with charity.</p>
            <p>On the contrary ſide, the Generals of the Regulars, and others ſaide, <note place="margin">An Apologie of the regular orders.</note> that the Biſhops and Curates hauing wholly abandoned the office of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, ſo that for many hundreds of yeeres the people remained without Sermons in the Church, and without the doctrine of Diuinitie in Schooles, God had raiſed the begging orders to ſupplie theſe neceſſary miniſteries; into which notwithſtanding they intruded not themſelues, but entred by the graunt of the Supreame Paſtour; vnto whom it principally appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to feede all the flocke of CHRIST, it cannot bee ſaide that men depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him, to ſupplie the defects of him that had the care of the flocke and did aband on it, haue vſurped the office of another. But it may bee ſay de, that if they had not vſed that charitie, there had now remained no ſigne of Chriſtianitie. Now that they haue applyed themſelues more then three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres to that holy worke, with ſuch fruit as appeareth, they haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:17208:95"/>
thoſe functions, and made them their owne, by a lawfull title, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the chiefe Paſtour, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that the Biſhops haue no lawfull right vnto them, nor can alleadge the vſe of antiquity to regaine that office, which ſo many hundred yeeres ſince they haue forſaken. That they haue a deſire of gayning for themſelues or their Monaſteries is a meere calumnie, becauſe the almes are gathered onely for their neceſſary foode, and apparell, and the reſidue being ſpent for the worſhip of God, in maſſes, buildings, and ornaments of Churches, turneth to the benefit and edification of the people, and not to their owne profit, that the ſeruices done by their orders to the holy Church, and doctrine of Diuinitie (which is no where to bee found but in their Cloiſters) deſerue the continuance of that charge which others are not able to exerciſe.</p>
            <p>The Legates, importuned by both parties, by the Councell of their moſt <note place="margin">The Legats relate this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>Rome</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> inward friends reſoluted to relate to <hi>Rome,</hi> and expect an anſwere. The Pope referred it to the Congregation; where preſently it was ſeene whither the pretence of the Biſhops tended; that is, to make themſelues ſo many Popes in their Dioceſſes. For when the Popes priuiledge and exemption ſhould bee remooued, and euery one ſhould depend on them, and none on the Pope, all cauſe of going to <hi>Rome</hi> would ceaſe. They conſidered that the Popes <note place="margin">The Deputies in <hi>Rome</hi> take part with the Mendicants, for reaſons of Policie.</note> haue anciently had for a principall ſecret to preſerue the Primacie giuen them by CHRIST, to exempt the Biſhops from the Arch-biſhop, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats from the Biſhops, and ſo to oblige men to defend him. That it is a cleere caſe, that after the ſixe hundredth yeere, the Primacie of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Sea hath beene vpheld by the Benedictine Monkes exempted, and after by the Congregations of Clunie, and Ciſtercium, and other monaſticall aſſemblies, vntill God raiſed the Mendicant orders, by which it hath beene maintained vntill now. Wherefore to take away their priuiledges, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to oppugne the Papacie, and not thoſe orders; to remooue the exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were a manifeſt depreſſion of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe they ſhould want meanes to keepe a Biſhop within compaſſe, that hee exalt not himſelfe too high. Therefore that the Pope and Court were compelled by neceſſitie to maintaine the Friars cauſe. But to doe theſe things ſmoothely, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered alſo that it was neceſſary to conceale this reaſon; and they reſolued to anſwere the Legates, that by all meanes they ſhould preſerue the ſtate of <note place="margin">The Popes anſwere.</note> the Regulars, and cauſe the Biſhops to ſurceaſe, ſetting before them the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue number of the friars, and the credit which they haue with the people, and aduiſe them to take a moderate courſe, and not make a Schiſme, by deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring too much. That it was iuſt they ſhould receiue ſome ſatisfaction, but they ſhould alſo bee content to giue it; and when they came to the point, they ſhould grant any thing concerning the Pardoners, but ſhould doe nothing concerning the Friars, without communicating it to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, and ſhould giue the Biſhops ſome ſatisfaction which might not take away the priuiledges. That they ſhould doe the like for the Vniuerſities; becauſe it was neceſſary that both theſe and thoſe ſhould depend on the Pope, and not on the Biſhops.</p>
            <p>After theſe letters came to <hi>Trent,</hi> thoſe of the Councell had three diuers endes. For the other particulars propoſed in theſe two matters, by thoſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17208:95"/>
who were not intereſted either to fauour or disfauour the exemptions, were but little conſidered of. For the Lectures, ſome propoſed the reſtitution of the ancient vſe when Monaſteries and Canons cloiſters were but Colledges and Schooles. Whereof ſome remainder appeareth in many Cathedral Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where there is the dignitie of a Schooleman, Head of the readers, with a Prebend. Theſe men now doe not performe the duetie, and indeede are vnable. All thought it honeſt and profitable to reſtore the Diuinitie Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in Cathedral Churches, and Monaſteries. For the former they thought it eaſie to make prouiſion, by committing the care of the execution thereof to the Biſhops; but for the latter very difficult. The Legates oppoſed the Superintendencie of Biſhops, euen in this alſo, though it were ouer Monkes onely, not Mendicants, for feare of leauing a gate open to them, to meddle with priuiledges granted by the Pope. But <hi>Sebaſtianus Pighius,</hi> Auditor of <note place="margin">The inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor of the <hi>Rota.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>Rota,</hi> found a temper for this, that the ſuperintendencie ſhould be giuen to the Biſhops, as Delegates of the Apoſtolique Sea. The inuention plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe it was in fauour of the Biſhops, without derogation of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, for the Biſhop was to ſuperintend, not as Biſhop, but as the Popes Delegate. And this gaue a paterne to accommodate other difficulties; one in giuing authoritie to the Metropolitans, ouer Pariſhes vnited to Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, not ſubiect to any Dioceſſe; another, in giuing power to Biſhops ouer exempted Preachers, who faile; and ſerued alſo very much in the Decrees of the Seſſions that were after.</p>
            <p>The Canoniſts propoſed that the Schoole ſubtiltie was not fit in theſe <note place="margin">Politique rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</note> times, and that it beſeemed rather naturall things, and Philoſophie, that theſe new Lectures ſhould bee introduced to handle the Sacraments, and the authority of the Church, as <hi>Turrecremata, Auguſtinus Triumphus,</hi> &amp; after them <hi>S. Antoninus,</hi> and others haue done with great fruit. But the Fryars contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, and oppoſing that this doctrine was as neceſſary as that, they found a temper, and ordered that the Lecture ſhould bee for expoſition of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that the matter ſhould be fitted to the exigence of the text read, and the capacitie of the auditors.</p>
            <p>After many Diſcourſes in many Congregations, they came to eſtabliſh the Decrees for the Sermons, and to ouercome the difficulties, they cauſed the Prelates, who were their aſſured friends, to negotiate with the Italian Biſhops, wiſhing them to conſider how much they were bound, for the honour of their nation, to vphold the dignitie of the Papacie, whoſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie was treated of by medling with the priuiledges, and what they might hope for from the Pope and Legates, applying themſelues to that which is iuſt, and not depriuing the Friars of that they haue enioyed ſo long. That it was dangerous to deſpiſe ſo many learned men, now when hereſies doe trouble the Church. That the authoritie of Biſhops ſhould be enlarged, by granting them power to allow or diſallow the Preachers when they preach out of the Churches of their Order; and when they preach in them, by making them acknowledge the Prelate, firſt asking his benediction. That the Biſhops might puniſh the Preachers for hereſie, &amp; forbid them to preach, to auoyd ſcandall. That they ſhould bee contented with this, and that other things ſhould bee added, as occaſion ſerued. By this meanes they gained ſo
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17208:96"/>
many, that they were ſecure to eſtabliſh the Decree with thoſe conditions. But there remained another difficulty; becauſe the Friars and Generals were not ſatisfied, and to diſtaſte them was not ſecure, and expreſly forbid by the Pope. They endeauored to ſhew them, that the grant made to the Biſhops, was iuſt and neceſſary, whereof themſelues were cauſe, by extending their priuiledges too much, and by paſſing the bounds of honeſty. In fine, by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing the Biſhops to proceed ſo, that the Friars might not haue cauſe to complaine, the Generals alſo were pacified.</p>
            <p>When they made knowne their reſolution to condemne in the ſame Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lutheran opinions of originall ſinne, they alleadged, that, to keepe the order of putting both the matters together, it was neceſſary to handle ſome poynt of faith, and that they could not begin from any other poynt. And they propoſed the Articles extracted out of the Proteſtants doctrine in that matter, to bee examined and diſcuſſed by the Diuines in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, whether they ought to bee condemned for hereticall. The Cardinall <hi>Pacceco</hi> ſaid, that the Councell was to handle Articles of faith, onely to reduce <hi>Germanie,</hi> the which hee that would doe out of ſeaſon, ſhould not onely faile of his ende, but make matters worſe. When there is opportunitie to doe it, it cannot bee knowen to thoſe in <hi>Trent,</hi> but onely to him that ſitteth at the ſterne of that Countrey, who, ſeeing all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, knoweth when to applie the medicine. Therefore hee aduiſed that they ſhould craue by letters the opinion of the principall Prelates of the Nation, before they went any further, or that the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> ſhould ſpeake thereof with the Emperour. To which opinion the Emperours Prelates, induced by the Ambaſſadour, did adhere. But the Legates, commending their iudgement, and promiſing to write to the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> added, that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this, the Articles might bee diſputed by the Diuines, to gaine time; whereunto the Cardinall alſo, and the others, adhered, hoping that many difficulties might come acroſſe, to cauſe a delay, and the Ambaſſadour <hi>Toledo</hi> was contented, ſo that the Summer might bee paſt before the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were made.</p>
            <p>The Articles propoſed, were.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Adam,</hi> by tranſgreſſing the precept, hath loſt iuſtice, and incurred the <note place="margin">The points of originall ſinne to bee diſcuſſed.</note> wrath of God, and mortalitie; and though hee bee impaired both in ſoule and bodie, yet no ſinne is transferred from him to poſteritie, but onely cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne is called originall, becauſe it is deriued from him to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, not by tranſmiſſion, but by imitation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That originall ſinne is ignorance, or contempt of God, or want of feare, without confidence in his Maieſtie, without diuine loue, and with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, and bad deſires; and generally a corruption of the whole man in his will, ſoule, and body.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That in children there is an inclination to euill, proceeding from the corrupted nature, ſo that after the vſe of reaſon, it bringeth forth a loathing of diuine things, and an immerſion in matters of the world; and that this is originall ſinne.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That children, at the leaſt borne of faithfull parents, though they are
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17208:96"/>
baptized into the remiſſion of ſinnes, yet they haue no ſinne by deſcending from <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. That originall ſinne is not cancelled in Baptiſme, but not imputed, or ſo razed, that it beginneth to diminſh in this life, and is wholly rooted out in that to come.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That the ſinne remayning in the baptized, hindereth his entrance into heauen.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That concupiſcence which cheriſheth ſinne, and remayneth after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, is truely ſin.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That the principall puniſhment due to originall ſinne, is hell fire, beſides corporall death, and other imperfections, vnto which man is ſubiect in this life.</p>
            <p>The Diuines in the Congregation agreed, that to diſcuſſe thoſe Articles, it was neceſſary not to proceed in that order, but to examine all the matter methodically, and ſee what was ſinne in <hi>Adam,</hi> and what, deriued from him to poſterity, is ſin in all men, called originall, how it is tranſmitted, and how remitted.</p>
            <p>In the firſt point alſo they agreed, that <hi>Adam</hi> being depriued of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, <note place="margin">The diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne.</note> his affections rebelled againſt reaſon; which the Scripture vſeth to expreſſe, ſaying, the fleſh rebelleth againſt the ſpirit, and by one onely name, calleth his defect Concupiſcence. That hee incurred the wrath of God, and corporall mortalitie, threatned by God, together with the ſpirituall death of the ſoule; and yet that none of theſe defects can be called ſinne, but puniſhments that follow. For ſinne is formally the tranſgreſſion of a diuine precept. And here many enlarged themſelues, to finde out the kinde of this fault. Some ſaid it was pride, ſome gluttony, ſome infidelity, and ſome more ſoundly, that it might bee drawne to all theſe, and more. But hee that will take S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words for his ground, can put it in no other kinde, but of pure diſobedience. But ſeeking to know what thing deriued from <hi>Adam</hi> is ſin in vs, the opinions were more diuers. For S. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> who firſt ſought into the eſſence thereof, following S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaid it is concupiſcence. And S. <hi>Anſelmus,</hi> many hundred yeeres after, holding that ſin is cancelled in the baptized, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence ſtill remayning, maintayned that it is the priuation of originall righteouſneſſe, which in Baptiſme is renewed, by a thing equiualent, which is grace. But S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and S. <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> deſiring to reconcile theſe two opinions, conſidered that in our corrupted nature there are two rebellions; one of the ſoule againſt God, the other of the ſences againſt the ſoule; and that this is concupiſcence, and that vnrighteouſneſſe, and therefore both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether are the ſin. And S. <hi>Bonauenture</hi> gaue the firſt place to concupiſcence, ſaying that this is poſitiue, and the other negatiue. And S. <hi>Thomas</hi> contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made concupiſcence the materiall part, and the priuation of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the formall. Whereupon he ſaid, that this ſinne in vs is concupiſcence, deſtitute of originall righteouſneſſe. The Maſter of the Sentences, and the old Schoolemen followed S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> opinion, which was maintained in the Councell by two Hermite Friars. But becauſe <hi>Iohn Scotus</hi> defended the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his countrey-man <hi>Anſelmus,</hi> the Franſciſcans maintained it in the Councel, and the greater part of the Dominicans that of S. <hi>Thomas.</hi> So it was
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17208:97"/>
declared what was the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and what originall ſinne in other men.</p>
            <p>But they were more troubled to diſcourſe how it was tranſmitted from him to poſterity, and ſucceſſiuely from father to ſonne. For Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who opened the way vnto others, preſſed with the obiection of <hi>Iulianus</hi> the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian, who asked him of the manner of tranſmitting originall ſinne when man is conceiued, ſeeing that Matrimony and the vſe thereof is holy, neither <note place="margin">How original ſinne is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie.</note> God the firſt authour ſinning, nor the parents, nor he that is borne, by what chinke ſinne entred, anſwered onely, that chinkes were not to bee ſought where a gate ſtood wide open, the Apoſtle ſaying, that by <hi>Adam</hi> ſinne entred into the world. And in many places where he was to ſpeake hereof, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe doubtfull, and was irreſolute whether as the body of the childe is deriued from the body of the father, ſo the ſoule from the ſoule. For the fountaine being infected, the riuer muſt needs bee defiled. The modeſtie of this Saint, was not imitated by the Schoolemen; who, being reſolued that euery ſoule is created immediately by God, ſaid, that the infection was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in the fleſh, contracted by our fore-fathers in the earthly Paradiſe, either from the poyſoned qualitie of the fruit, or the venimous breath of the Serpent. Which contamination is deriued into the fleſh of the children, which is a part of their parents fleſh, and is contracted by the ſoule in the infuſion, as a liquor contracteth the ill qualitie of an infected veſſell; and the infection is cauſed in the fleſh, by the luſt of the parents in the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the variety of opinions made no difference in the cenſure of the Articles: For euery one cleauing to his owne, ſhewed that it was decided by it, that the firſt article was hereticall, which vndoubtedly was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ſuch in the Councell of <hi>Palestina,</hi> and in many of <hi>Africa</hi> againſt <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius.</hi> And it was reexamined in <hi>Trent,</hi> not as it was found in the writings of <hi>Luther,</hi> or his followers, but as it was auerred by <hi>Zuinglius:</hi> who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſeemed to ſome of the Diuines, who diſcuſſed his words well, to thinke rather that in the poſteritie of <hi>Adam</hi> it was no ſinne of action, but a corruption and transformation of nature, which hee called a ſinne in the kinde of ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Article was eſteemed hereticall by all, and was by the ſame <hi>Pelagius</hi> long ſince inuented; who, becauſe hee was not condemned in the Councell of <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> for ſaying that <hi>Adam</hi> had not hurt his poſteritie, hee recanted, and confeſſed the contrary, and after, together with his followers, declared himſelfe that <hi>Adam</hi> had damnified his poſterity, not by tranſmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne, but by giuing them a bad example, which hurteth thoſe that doe imitate it. And <hi>Eraſmus</hi> was noted to haue renewed the ſame aſſertion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> That by <hi>Adam</hi> ſinne entred into the world, and paſſed into all, in regard all haue imitated, and doe imitate his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
            <p>The third Article for the firſt part, was cenſured in <hi>Trent,</hi> as alſo in many Colloquies in <hi>Germany,</hi> by ſaying that thoſe actions could not bee originall ſinne, ſeeing they are not in children, nor alwayes in thoſe of ripe age: ſo that to ſay there was no ſinne but that, was wholly to deny it, and not to ſatisfie the excuſe of thoſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> who vnder the name of actions, vnderſtand
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17208:97"/>
a naturall inclination to ill, and an inability to good. For, if they vnderſtood it ſo, it was ſit to ſay it, and not to ſpeak euill, but ſo as that others may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them well. And though Saint <hi>Austin</hi> ſpake thus when hee ſaid, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall righteouſneſſe was to obey God, and not to haue concupiſcence, hee would alter his ſpeech if he had beene in theſe times, becauſe it is very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to name the cauſe for the effect, and the effect for the cauſe, when they are proper and adequate. But it is not ſo in this caſe for originall ſinne is not the cauſe of thoſe bad actions, except a bad will, as principall, be added. But for the ſecond part of the Article, they ſaid, that if the Proteſtants vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a priuatiue corruption, the opinion may be tolerated; but they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a corrupted ſubſtance, as if the proper nature of man were changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another forme, then that in which it was created, and reprehend the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, when they call the ſinne a priuation of Iuſtice, as a fountaine without water; but they call it a fountaine from whence corrupted waters doe iſſue, which are the acts of incredulity, diſtruſt, hatred, contumacie, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate loue of ones ſelfe, and worldly things: and therefore that it was fit abſolutely to condemne the Article. And the fourth alſo was cenſured by the ſame reaſon, ſaying that inclination to bee the puniſhment of ſinne, and not ſinne formally; and without alleadging ought elſe, it was abſolutely denied to bee a ſinne.</p>
            <p>It muſt not bee omitted that in this poynt, the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine <note place="margin">The Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans exempt the Virgine <hi>Mary</hi> from ſinne, and are oppoſed by the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</note> themſelues from exempting the Virgine, the mother of GOD, from this law by a ſpeciall priuiledge, endeauoring to enlarge themſelues in the queſtion, and to prooue it; and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> laboured to comprehend her by name, vnder the common law, though the Cardinall of <hi>Monte</hi> omitted no occaſion to make them leaue that controuerſie, ſaying, they were aſſembled to condemne the hereſies, not the opinions of the Catholiques.</p>
            <p>No man reſiſted the condemnation of the articles. But Fryar <hi>Ambroſius</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The opinion of <hi>Catarinus.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Catarinus</hi> noted the reaſons for vnſufficient, in that they declared not the true nature of this ſinne; and ſhewed it in a long diſcourſe. The ſubſtance whereof was; that it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh the ſinne from the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that concupiſcence and priuation of righteouſneſſe, is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne; therefore that it is neceſſary the ſinne ſhould bee another thing. He added, that which was not a ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> it is impoſſible it ſhould be a ſinne in vs: but neither of theſe two were ſinne in <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe neither priuation of righteouſneſſe, nor concupiſcence were his actions; therefore neither are they in vs; and if they were effects of ſinne in him, of neceſſitie they muſt be ſo in others alſo. By which reaſon, it cannot be ſaid that ſinne is the enmitie of GOD againſt the ſinner, nor the ſinners enmitie againſt GOD, ſeeing they are things that follow ſinne, and come after it. Hee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned alſo the tranſmiſſion of ſinne, by meanes of the ſeed and generation, ſaying, That as, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, righteouſneſſe would haue beene transfuſed, not by vertue of the generation, but onely by the will of God, ſo it is fit to finde another meanes to transfuſe ſinne. And hee explaned his opinion in this forme; that as God made a Couenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and all his poſteritie, when he made him father of the faithfull, ſo when he gaue originall righteouſneſſe to <hi>Adam</hi> and all mankinde, hee made him ſeale an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17208:98"/>
in the name of all, to keepe it for himſelfe and them, obſeruing the commandements; which becauſe he tranſgreſſed, he loſt it as well for others as himſelfe, &amp; incurred the puniſhments alſo for them; the which as they are deriued into euery one, ſo the very tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> belonged to euery one; to him as the cauſe, to others by vertue of the Couenant; ſo that the action of <hi>Adam</hi> is actuall ſinne in him, and imputed to others, is originall; becauſe when hee ſinned, all mankind did ſinne with him. <hi>Catarinus</hi> groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelfe principally, for that a true and proper ſinne muſt needs bee a voluntary act, and no other thing can bee voluntary but the tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed vnto all. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaying that all haue ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> it muſt bee vnderſtood that they haue all committed the ſame ſinne with him. He alleadged for example, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>Leui</hi> paid tithe to <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> when hee paid it in his great Grandfather <hi>Abraham;</hi> by which reaſon it muſt bee ſaid, that the poſteritie violated the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD, when <hi>Adam</hi> did it, and that they were ſinners in him, as in him they receiued righteouſnes. And ſo there is no need to run to luſt which infecteth the fleſh, whence the ſoule receiueth infection. For it cannot bee vnderſtood, how a ſpirit can receiue a corporall paſſion; and if ſinne were a ſpirituall blemiſh in the ſoule, it could not firſt be in the fleſh, and if it be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall in the fleſh, it can work none effect in the ſpirit. That the ſoule, by ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it ſelfe with an infected body, doth receiue ſpirituall infection, is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiueable tranſcendencie. He prooued the couenant of God with <hi>Adam,</hi> by a place of the Prophet <hi>Oſea,</hi> by another of <hi>Eccleſiasticus,</hi> and by many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi> That the ſinne of euery one is the act onely of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> hee proued by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee ſaith, That by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of one man, many are made ſinners; and becauſe the Church hath euer vnderſtood that ſinne is nothing elſe but a voluntary action againſt the law, of which kind there was none but that of <hi>Adam;</hi> and becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, That death entred by originall ſinne, which entred onely by actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all tranſgreſſion. And hee brought for the principall proofe, that though <hi>Eue</hi> did eate the apple before <hi>Adam,</hi> yet ſhe knew not ſhe was naked, nor that ſhee had incurred the puniſhment, but onely after <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, as it was not his alone, but of <hi>Eue</hi> too, ſo was it alſo of all his poſteritie.</p>
            <p>But Fryar <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> to defend the opinion of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and of the other Diuines from the obiections of <hi>Catarinus,</hi> brought a new expoſition, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dominicus Soro</hi> croſſeth the opinion of <hi>Catarinus.</hi>
               </note> and ſaid, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned actually in eating of the forbidden fruit, but after he remained a ſinner by an habituall qualitie, cauſed by the action, as by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad action ſuch a diſpoſition is bred in the minde of the actor, by which, though the act be paſt, he remaineth, and is called a ſinner; that <hi>Adams</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was tranſitory, nor had exiſtence, but while hee wrought; that the habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all qualitie remaining in him, paſſed into the poſteritie, and is transfuſed as proper vnto euery one; that <hi>Adams</hi> action is not originall ſin, but that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent habit which the Theologues call priuation of righteouſneſſe, which may be wel expounded, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that man is called a ſinner, not only when hee tranſgreſſeth actually, but after alſo, vntill the ſinne bee cancelled, not in regard of the puniſhments, or other conſequences of ſinne, but in regard of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17208:98"/>
the preceding tranſgreſſion it ſelfe; as that which maketh a man crooked, vntill hee bee ſtraightned againe; who is ſaid to be ſo, not by an actuall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by that effect which remaineth after the action is paſt. Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared originall ſinne to crookedneſſe, as it is indeede a ſpirituall obliquitie; for the whole nature of man being in <hi>Adam,</hi> when hee made himſelfe croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by tranſgreſſing the Precept, the whole nature of man, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, euery particular perſon remained crooked not by the curuitie of <hi>Adam,</hi> but by his owne, by which hee is truely crooked and a ſinner, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee bee ſtraightened by the grace of God. Theſe two opinions were ſharpely diſputed, and euery one pretended that his owne ſhould be receiued by the Synode.</p>
            <p>But in the conſideration how originall ſinne was remitted, they agreed <note place="margin">How original ſin is renutted</note> all, that it is cancelled by baptiſme, and the ſoule reſtored pure into the ſtate of innocencie, though the puniſhments which follow ſinne bee not remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that they may bee an exerciſe for the iuſt. And this all of them expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſaying, that the perfection of <hi>Adam</hi> conſiſted in an infuſed qualitie, which adorned the ſoule, made it perfect and acceptable to God, and exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the bodie from mortalitie. And God, for the merit of CHRIST, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto thoſe that are regenerated by baptiſme another quality called iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying grace, which wiping out euery blemiſh in the ſoule, maketh it pure, as was that of <hi>Adam;</hi> yea in ſome it worketh greater effects then originall righteouſneſſe, but onely that it worketh no effect in the bodie, whereby mortalitie, and other naturall defects are not remooued. Many places of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles were alleadged, where they ſay, that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme waſheth, cleanſeth, illuminateth and purifieth the ſoule, ſo that no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, ſpot or wrinkle remaineth. It was exactly diſcourſed, how, if the baptiſed haue no ſinne, ſinne can paſſe into their children? Whereunto <hi>Auguſtinus</hi> anſwered with examples onely: as of a circumciſed father the ſonne is borne vncircumciſed, and of a blinde man one that can ſee, and of a pure graine, one clad in ſtraw. <hi>Catarinus</hi> anſwered, that the Couenant was made with <hi>Adam</hi> onely, and that euery one hath ſinne by imputation of that of <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo that the intermediate Parents haue nothing to doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: and if the forbidden fruit had beene eaten, not by <hi>Adam,</hi> but by one of his ſonnes, his poſterity had not ſinned; and if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned after hee had begotſonnes, his ſinne had beene imputed to them though borne before. <hi>Soto</hi> diſputed againſt it, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned after his ſonnes were borne, thoſe would not haue beene obnoxious vnto it, but their poſterity ſhould.</p>
            <p>The common voyce was, that the ſixt Article was hereticall, for ſaying there remaineth in the baptized ſomething worthy of death: and the ſeuenth for leauing remainders of ſinne in the baptized: and the eight moſt cleerely, for making concupiſcence a ſinne in the baptiſed. Only <hi>Antoninus Marinarus,</hi> a Carmelite Friar, affirming, as the others, that ſinne is cancelled by baptiſme, and that concupiſcence is before ſinne, yet, for condemning the contrary of hereſie, hee conſidered that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> being olde, writing heere of to <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facius,</hi> ſayd plainely that concupiſcence was not a ſinne but a cauſe and an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſinne: and writing againſt <hi>Iulianus</hi> hee ſaid in as plaine termes, that it
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:17208:99"/>
was ſinne, and the cauſe, and effect thereof: and yet in his retractions hee neuer made mention of either of theſe two contrary propoſitions, becauſe hee thought hee might ſpeake both wayes of it, in regard it was not a matter of faith, the difference being rather verball then otherwiſe. For it is one thing to aske if a thing bee a ſinne, or if it bee a ſinne to a perſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. As hee that goeth foorth to hunt for things neceſſary for his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance, if hee thinke to kill a wilde beaſt, and, by inuincible ignorance, ſlaye a man, the Lawyers ſay that the action is murder, and a ſinne: but the hunter is excuſed, ſo that vnto him it is not, by reaſon of his ignorance. So concupiſcence, beeing the ſame before and after baptiſme, is ſinne in it ſelfe; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, that it reſiſteth the Law of God, euen in the regenerate, and whatſoeuer doth that is ſinne. But hee that is baptized is excuſed; becauſe hee is cladde with CHRIST: ſo that the Article is true one way, and falſe another; and it is not iuſt to condemne a propoſition, which is true in one ſence, without diſtinguiſhing it firſt. This opinion was reiected by all, and it was ſaid that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> made two ſortes of concupiſcence; one before baptiſme, which is a repugnancie of the will to the Law of God, which hee ſayd was ſinne, and aboliſhed in Baptiſme; another, which is the repugnancie of the ſence to reaſon, which remaineth after baptiſme, which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> called the cauſe and effect, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſinne: and when hee ſeemeth to ſay otherwiſe, it muſt bee defended that his minde is; that concupiſcence is a ſinne, which by baptiſme leaueth to bee ſo, and becommeth an exerciſe of vertue and good workes. To this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Soto</hi> they ioyned what hee had ſaid in his ſermons, made in the Maſſe on the fourth Sunday of the laſt Aduent, and in that of the Lent, exhorting to repoſe all confidence in God, condemning all truſt in workes, and affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that the heroicall Actes of the ancients, ſo renowned by men, were truely ſinne; that hee ſpake of the difference of the Law and the Goſpel, not as of two times, but as if the Goſpel had beene euer, and the Law ought to be euer, and alſo of the certaintie of Grace, though with ambiguous and doubtfull clauſes, for feare they might ſo reprehend him, that he could not bee defended. This made the Friar ſuſpected by ſome, that he was not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Soto</hi> is ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theraniſme.</note> auerſe from the Proteſtants doctrine.</p>
            <p>When they came to the Article of the puniſhment, though Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> grounding himſelfe vpon Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> held expreſly, that the paines of hell fire belonged vnto it, euen in little children, whereunto none of the holy Fathers contradicted, yet the maſter of the ſentences, with the Schoolemen, who follow moſt of all Philoſophicall reaſons, diſtinguiſhed two kindes of eternall puniſhments; one the priuation onely of celeſtiall bleſſedneſſe, the other, a chaſtiſement: and they aſſigned the firſt onely to originall ſinne. Onely <hi>Gregorie</hi> of <hi>Arimini</hi> forſooke the generall opinion of the Schoolemen, who by that meanes gayned the name of <hi>Tormenter of children.</hi> But neither he nor Saint <hi>Austin</hi> were defended by the Theologues in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. Yet there was another diuiſion amongſt them. For the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A difference betweene the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> and <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> about <hi>Limbo.</hi>
               </note> ſayd that children dead, without baptiſme before the vſe of reaſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine after the reſurrection in a <hi>Limbo</hi> and darkeneſſe vnder the earth, but without fire: the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> ſayd they are to remaine vpon the earth, and in

light. Some affirmed alſo, that they ſhould bee Philoſophers, buſying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the knowledge of naturall things, not without that great pleaſure which happeneth when curioſitie is ſatisfied by inuention. <hi>Catarinus</hi> ſaid fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they ſhall bee viſited and comforted by the holy Angels and Saints. And in this ſo many vanities were deliuered, that they might giue great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of entertainement. But for reuerence of <hi>Auſtine,</hi> and not to condemne <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Arimini,</hi> the <hi>Auguſtinians</hi> made great meanes, that the Article, though falſe, as they thought, might not bee condemned for hereticall; though <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarinus</hi> imployed all his force to the contrary, to repreſſe (as he ſaid) the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ignorance of ſome Preachers, who, to the great ſcandall of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, publiſh that doctrine, affirming that Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> had ſaid ſo onely in heate of diſputation againſt the Pelagians, and not becauſe hee was cleare in that opinion. Whereupon, ſince the truth is declared to the contrary by common conſent of the Schooles, and that the Lutheranes haue raiſed the ſame errours, and the Catholiques themſelues fall into it, the declaration of the Synode is neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The cenſure of the Diuines being ended, and the points treated of by the <note place="margin">The Prelates did ſcarcely vnderſtand the diſcourſes of the Diuines</note> Fathers, to reſolue vpon the forme of the Decree, the Biſhoppes (amongſt whom very few had knowledge in Theologie, but were either Lawyers, or learned men of the Court) were confounded with this ſcholaſticall and crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed manner of handling the Articles; and amongſt ſo-many opinions, knew not what to thinke of the eſſence of originall ſinne. That of <hi>Catarinus</hi> was beſt vnderſtood, becauſe it was expreſſed by a politicall conceit of a bargaine made by one for his poſteritie, which being tranſgreſſed, they are all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly bound; and many of the Fathers did fauour that. But perceiuing the contradiction of the other Diuines, they durſt not receiue it. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the ſin, this onely they held to bee cleare, that euery one hath ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſin before baptiſme, and is perfectly purged of it by baptiſme. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they concluded that this ſhould bee eſtabliſhed for faith, and the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condemned for hereſie, together with all thoſe opinions which deny ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſin, in what ſort ſoeuer: but what that ſin is, there being ſo many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences amongſt the Diuines, they ſaid it was not poſſible to ſet downe ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, that it might ſatisfie all, and not condemne ſome opinion, which might cauſe a ſchiſme.</p>

This laſt ſhewed more then the others, that it was not conuenient, nor euer vſed by any Councel, to condemne an opinion for hereticall, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out declaring firſt which is Catholique; that no true negatiue hath in it ſelfe the cauſe of its truth, but is ſo by the truth of an affirmatiue; nor euer any propoſition was falſe, but becauſe another is true: neither can the falſity of the one be knowne, but by him who knoweth the truth of the other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the opinion of the Lutherans cannot bee condemned of hereſie, vntill the opinion of the Church be ſet downe. He that ſhall obſerue the maner of proceeding in all Councels, which haue handled matter of faith, will ſee, that they haue laid firſt an Orthodoxe foundation, and by that condemned the hereſies; and ſo it is neceſſary to doe now. For when it ſhall be read that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17208:100"/>
the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> hath condemned the Lutheranes, for ſaying originall ſinne is ignorance, contempt, diſtruſt, an hate of heauenly things, and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the whole man in the will, ſoule and body, who is there that will not demand, what is it then? and will not ſay in himſelfe, if this opinion bee hereticall, which is Catholike? And when he ſhal ſee the opinion of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> condemned, that children the ſonnes of the faithfull, are baptized into remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, though nothing bee tranſmitted from <hi>Adam</hi> but the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the corruption of nature, will not ſuddenly aske, what elſe is then tranſmitted? In ſumme, he concluded, that the Councel was aſſembled prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to tell the Catholique trueth, not onely to condemne hereſies. The Biſhop ſaid, That theſe Articles hauing been ſo often diſputed in the Diets <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Sinigaglia,</hi> &amp; Friar <hi>Ierom</hi> Generall of the <hi>Auguſtins</hi> ſpeake to the ſame purpoſe.</note> of <hi>Germanie,</hi> euery one would expect from the Councell a perſpicuous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, cleared from all difficulties. The Generall alſo, who was ſomewhat ſuſpected to bee ſuborned by the Ambaſſador <hi>Toledo,</hi> added, that the true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique doctrine of originall ſinne is contained in the writings of S. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> that <hi>Egidius Romanus</hi> had wrote a booke thereof; that whenſoeuer the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would take but a little paines, they might bee able to vnderſtand the truth, and iudge of it; that they ſhould not ſuffer a fame to bee ſpread, that in <hi>Trent</hi> that was reſolued in foure dayes, which in <hi>Germanie</hi> hath beene ſo long diſcuſſed without concluſion.</p>
            <p>Theſe aduertiſements were not hearkened vnto, becauſe the Prelates had no hope to bee able by ſtudie to bee well informed in the crabbed ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynts, neither durſt they goe about to make triall of it; and becauſe the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats had receiued abſolute command from <hi>Rome</hi> to define this matter in the next ſeſſion, they were conſtrained to auoid the difficulties, eſpecially becauſe the Cardinall of <hi>Monte</hi> was reſolued to make this great iumpe by all meanes. And therefore calling vnto him the Generals of the Orders, and the Diuines, <hi>Catarinus</hi> and <hi>Vega,</hi> who ſpake more then the reſt, he charged them to paſſe by the difficulties, and helpe forward the diſpatch.</p>
            <p>The Prelates deputed to frame the decree, with the aſſiſtance of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, deuided the matter into fiue <hi>Anathematiſmes.</hi> The firſt, of the perſonall ſin of <hi>Adam:</hi> the ſecond, of the transfuſion into poſterity: the third, of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy by baptiſme: the fourth, of the baptiſme of children: the fifth, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence remaining. After this, the opinions of the <hi>Zuinglians</hi> were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the foure firſt, and of <hi>Luther</hi> in the fifth.

They ſaid, that though the Church had tolerated the opinion of the conception, yet hee that would examine the matter well, might find that ſhee was not exempted from the common infection. And the others oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17208:100"/>
that it would bee as much as to condemne the Church, who celebrateth the conception as immaculate, and a kinde of ingratitude, derogating from the honour due vnto her, by whom all the graces of CHRIST paſſe vnto vs. The diſputations turned into contention, ſo farre, that the Emperours Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour had hope to obtaine his deſigne, that the matter might not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the next Seſſion.</p>
            <p>Many things were propoſed vpon that occaſion, which cauſed them to <note place="margin">A diſcourſe of the Author to ſhew how the bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> came to be worſhipped.</note> proceede to the Decree, which ſhall bee rehearſed; which becauſe it affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded matter of diſcourſe, for the entire vnderſtanding of all, it is neceſſary to relate from the beginning the originall of this controuerſie. After that the impietie of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> had diuided CHRIST, making two ſonnes, and denying him to be God who was borne of the bleſſed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin,</hi> the Church, to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Catholike trueth in the mindes of the faithfull, made often mention of her in the Churches as well of the Eaſt as of the Weſt; with this ſhort forme of wordes in Greeke, <hi>Maria</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in Latin, <hi>Maria mater Dei.</hi> This beeing inſtituted onely for the honour of CHRIST, was by little and little communicated alſo to the mother, and finally applyed to her alone; and therefore when images began to multiplie, CHRIST was painted as a babe in his mothers armes, to put vs in minde of the worſhip due vnto him, euen in that age. But in progreſſe of time, it was turned into the worſhip of the mother without the ſonne, hee remayning as an appendex in the picture. The writers and Preachers, eſpecially thoſe that were contemplatiue, caried with the torrent of the vulgar, which is able to doe much in theſe matters, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to mention CHRIST, inuented with one accord new prayſes, Epithites, and religious ſeruices; in ſo much that about the yeere 1050. a dayly <hi>Office</hi> was inſtituted to the bleſſed Virgin, diſtinguiſhed by ſeuen Canonical houres, in a forme which anciently was euer vſed to the honour of the Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, and in the next hundred yeeres, the worſhip ſo increaſed, that it came to the height, euen to attribute that vnto her, which the Scriptures ſpeake of the Diuine wiſedome. And amongſt theſe inuented nouities this was one, her totall exemption from originall ſinne. Yet this remayned onely in the breaſts of ſome few priuate men, hauing no place in Eccleſiaſticall ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or amongſt the learned. About the yeere 1136. the Canons of <hi>Lions</hi> dared to bring it into the Eccleſiaſticall <hi>Offices.</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> who liued in thoſe times, eſteemed the moſt learned and pious of that age, who was moſt frequent in the prayſes of the bleſſed <hi>Virgin,</hi> ſo farre as to call her the necke of the Church, by which euery grace and influence paſſeth from the head, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed ſeuerely againſt the Canons, and wrote vnto them, reprehending them for introducing a dangerous nouitie without reaſon, or example of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie; that there want not places to praiſe the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin,</hi> who cannot be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a preſumptuous nouitie, mother of raſhneſſe, ſiſter of ſuperſtition, daughter of lightneſſe. The next age had Schoole-Doctors of both the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Franciſcan and Dominican, who in their writings refuted this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vntill about the yeere 1300. when <hi>Iohn Scot,</hi> a Franciſcan, putting the matter into diſputation, and examining the reaſons, did flie to the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, ſaying that God had power to free her from ſinne, or to cauſe ſinne to remaine in her onely for an inſtant, or for a certaine time: that God onely
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:17208:101"/>
knoweth which of theſe three is true; yet it is probable to attribute the firſt to <hi>Marie,</hi> in caſe it bee not repugnant to the authoritie of the Church, and of the Scripture. The doctrine of this famous Diuine was followed by the Franciſcan order. But in the particular of the conception, ſeeing the way layd open they affirmed abſolutely for true, that which hee had propoſed as poſſible and probable, vnder this doubtfull condition, <hi>if it bee not repugnant: to the Orthodoxe Faith.</hi> The Dominicans did conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; and followed Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> one of their order, famous for his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <note place="margin">S. <hi>Thomas</hi> is canonized by Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the, 22 to diſgrace the Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans.</note> and for the approbation of Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the two and twentieth, who, to depreſſe the Franciſcans, who did for the moſt part adhere to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> excommunicated by him, did canonize that Doctour and his doctrine. The ſhew of pietie and deuotion made the Franciſcan opinion generally more accepted, and more tenaciouſly receiued by the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris,</hi> which was in credite for eminent learning; and after long ventilation and diſcuſſion, was afterwards approoued by the Councell of <hi>Baſill,</hi> which forbade to preach and teach the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. This tooke place in thoſe Countreys which receiued the Councell. Finally Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, a Franciſcan, made two Bulles in this matter; one in the yeere one thouſand foure hundred ſeuentîe ſixe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing a new <hi>Office,</hi> compoſed by <hi>Leonard Nogarola Protonotarie,</hi> with Indulgences to him that did celebrate it, or aſſiſt: the other in the yeere one thouſand foure hundred eightie three, condemning the aſſertion, as falſe and erronious, that it is hereſie to hold the conception, or a ſinne to celebrate it, excommunicating the Preachers and others who noted that opinion of hereſie, or the contrarie, becauſe it was not as yet deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Apoſtolike Sea. But this did not appeaſe the contentions, which betweene the two orders of Friars ſtill waxed ſharper, and were renewed euery yeere in December; ſo that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth thinking to giue a remedie by deferring the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, made letters bee written vnto diuers. But afterwards he had more important cogitations, by reaſon of the nouities of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which in theſe contentions wrought that which happeneth in States, that the Citie being beleaguered, the factions doe ceaſe, and all ioyne againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemie. The Dominicans grounded themſelues vpon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the doctrine of the Fathers, and the moſt ancient Schoole-men, where not one iot was found in fauour of the others; but they alleadged for themſelues miracles, and contentment of the people. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Vdine,</hi> a Dominican Friar, ſayd, either you will that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the Fathers haue beleeued this exemption of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgine</hi> from the common condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or not. If they haue beleeued it, and yet haue ſpoken generally without euer making mention of this exception, imitate them alſo now. But if they haue beleeued the contrarie, your opinion is a nouitie. <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamus Lombardellus,</hi> a Franciſcan Friar, ſayd, that the authoritie of the preſent Church, was no leſſe then that of the Primitiue; if the conſent of that in thoſe times made men ſpeake without exception, the conſent of this, which appeareth in celebrating the Feaſt throughout, ought to induce vs not to omit it.</p>

            <p>The Decree of the reformation containeth two parts, one in matter of the Lectures, the other of the Sermons. For the Lectures it was ordered, that in the Churches where there is a ſtipend allotted for reading Diuinitie, the Biſhop ſhould prouide that the holy Scripture ſhould bee read by the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendary, it he be fit, and not being fit, the Biſhop ſhould depute a ſubſtitute, <note place="margin">The Decree of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to performe the charge: but for hereafter that the benefice ſhould not bee conferred but vpon a ſufficient perſon. That in the Cathedrall Churches of populous Cities, and collegiate Churches of great Caſtles, where no ſuch ſtipend is aſſigned, the firſt Prebend that falleth void, ſhould bee applyed to that vſe, or ſome ſimple benefice, or a contribution of all beneficed men, to inſtitute the Lecture. That in poore Churches, there ſhould bee at the leaſt a Maſter to teach Grammer, who ſhall enioy the fruits of ſome ſimple bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or haue a ſtipend from the Capitular or Epiſcopall table, or the Biſhop ſhall finde ſome other way to effect it. That in the Cloyſters of Monkes there ſhould be a Diuinitie Lecture, if it may bee, wherein if the Abbats ſhall bee negligent, they ſhall bee conſtrained to doe it, by the Biſhop as the Popes Delegate. That in the Conuents of the Regulars, there ſhould bee deputed Maſters of ſufficiencie to performe this charge. That in publique ſtudies, where a Diuinitie Lecture is not inſtituted, it ſhall bee inſtituted by the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and pietie of Princes, and Republiques; and where it hath beene inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and neglected, it ſhall bee reſtored. That none ſhall bee made a Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, either publike or priuate, before hee bee approoued by the Biſhop, as fit for his life, manners, and knowledge, except thoſe that reade in the Cloyſters of Monkes. That the priuiledges granted by law, to Publique Readers in Diuinitie, and ſchollers, for the enioying of the fruits of their benefices, in their abſence ſhall be preſerued.</p>
            <p>Concerning Sermons the Decree containeth, that the Biſhops and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates bee bound, if they bee not hindered, to preach the Goſpel in perſon, and if they bee, to ſubſtitute men of ſufficiencie. That the inferiour Curates ought to teach things neceſſary to ſaluation, either by themſelues, or others; at the leaſt on Sundayes and ſolemne Feaſts: whereunto they ſhall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the Biſhops, any exemption notwithſtanding. And the Curates of the Pariſhes ſubiect to Monaſteries, which are in no dioceſſe, ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the ſame by the Metropolitanes, as Delegates of the Pope, in caſe the Regular Prelate ſhall be negligent. That the Regulars ſhall not preach, except they be approoued, for their life, maners and knowledge, by their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours: and in the Churches of their Order, they ſhall demand the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Biſhop before the Sermon begin: but in other Churches they ſhall not preah without the Biſhops licence, which ſhall bee giuen them <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi> If the Preacher ſow errours or ſcandals, the Biſhop ſhal prohibite him; if hereſies, he ſhall proceede againſt him according to law and cuſtome: and if the Preacher bee a priuiledged perſon, hee ſhall doe it as delegate; yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care that the Preachers bee not moleſted by falſe imputations, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, and haue no cauſe to complaine of them. That they permit not that either Regulars who liue out of Cloyſters, or ſecular Prieſts, except they be knowen and allowed by them, doe preach vntill an account be giuen
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17208:103"/>
thereof to the Pope. That the Pardoners ſhall not preach, nor cauſe any to preach, and in caſe they doe, they ſhall be compelled to obey by the Biſhop, notwithſtanding the priuiledges. In fine, the 29. of Iulie, was aſſigned for the next Seſſion.</p>

That S. <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt gaue the title of Catholique to <hi>Childebert,</hi> in token of his incorrupt religion. That the Kings haue neuer ſuffered any ſect in any part of <hi>France,</hi> nor any but Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques; yea, haue procured the conuerſion of Strangers, Idolaters, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, and haue conſtrained them with pious armes to profeſſe the true and ſound religion. Hee ſhewed how <hi>Childebert</hi> compelled the Viſigothes, who were Arrians, to ioyne themſelues with the Catholique Church: and how <hi>Charles</hi> the Great made warre thirty yeeres with the Saxons, to reduce them to Chriſtian religion. Then he declared the fauors done to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He recounted the enterpriſes of <hi>Pipin</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Great againſt the Lumbards; and how, in a Synode of Biſhops, it was granted by <hi>Adrian</hi> to <hi>Charles,</hi> to create the Pope, and to approoue the Biſhops of his Dominion, and inueſt them after they had receiued the oath of fidelity. He added, that though his ſonne <hi>Ludouicus Pius,</hi> ſurrendred that authority to create the Pope, yet he reſerued that Legats ſhould be ſent vnto him, to preſerue amitie, which hath beene euer maintayned with mutuall offices. For which confidence, the Popes, in times of difficultie, either chaſed out of their Sea, or fearing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, haue retired themſelues into that Kingdome. That it cannot bee told how many dangers the French men haue runne, and how much money and blood they haue ſpent, to enlarge the liſts of the Chriſtian Empire, or to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that which hath bene vſurped by the Barbarians, or to reſtore the Popes, or to deliuer them from danger. Hee added, that King <hi>Francis</hi> deſcending from theſe, in the beginning of his reigne, after the victory atchieued in <hi>Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> did, with the ſame piety, goe to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> to meete <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme a peace with him; which hath continued with <hi>Adrian, Clement,</hi> and <hi>Paul:</hi> and in theſe 26. yeeres the points of faith being brought into great ambiguities in diuers regions, hee hath taken moſt exact care, that nothing ſhould be innouated in the common Eccleſiaſticall vſe, but all reſerued to the publique cenſures of the Church. And though hee bee of a quiet, pleaſing, and not bloody diſpoſition, yet hee hath vſed ſeueritie, and made grieuous Edicts; and hath brought to paſſe, by the diligence and vigilancie of his Iudges, that in ſo great a tempeſt, which hath ſubuerted many Cities, and whole Nations that moſt noble Kingdome ſhould not bee ſhaken, in which the ancient doctrine, rites, ceremonies, and manners, doe remaine: ſo that the Councel might ordaine what they thought to bee true and fitte for the Chriſtian Common-wealth. He ſaid further, that the King knew how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable it was to Chriſtendome to haue the Pope for <hi>Head,</hi> and that, beeing tempted and inuited, with moſt gaineful profers, to follow the example of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17208:103"/>
another, would not forſake his opinion, and thereby hath loſt his neighbors loue, with ſome diſaduantage. That vnderſtanding the Conuocation of the Councell, he preſently ſent ſome of his Biſhops, and when hee ſaw it went on in earneſt, and that the authoritie thereof was eſtabliſhed by many Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he hath ſent him for his Ambaſſadour, to aſſiſt them, and to procure, that at the laſt, they would conſtitute and propoſe the doctrine which ought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where to be profeſſed by all Chriſtians, and rectifie the Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, by the ſquare of the Canons; promiſing that the moſt Chriſtian King will cauſe all to be obſerued in his kingdome, and protect the decrees of the Councell. Then he added, that, the merits of the French King being ſo great, his priuiledges, granted by the ancient Fathers and Popes, ought to be preſerued, which <hi>Ludouicus Pius,</hi> &amp; all the Kings of <hi>France</hi> ſince haue poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: and the rights, priuiledges, and immunities confirmed to the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> of which hee is defender, Which if the Councell will doe, the French-men will be thankfull, and the Fathers will not repent them of their deede. <note place="margin">And is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les Seuerollo.</hi>

               </note> matter of diſcourſe. It was ſayd that the <hi>Pelagian</hi> impietie was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſly handled, being by ſo many Councels, and the common conſent of the Church, more then a thouſand yeeres ſince, condemned, that it had beene tolerable if the ancient doctrine had beene confirmed; that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie vnto it, they had well propoſed a true vniuerſall propoſition, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> did paſſe into all his poſteritie, but after had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed it, by an exception; that it helped the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, that the exception was not aſſertiue, but ambiguous: for as one particular maketh falſe the contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie vniuerſall, ſo one ambiguons particular, maketh the vniuerſall vncertaine. And who ſeeth not that ſo long as this exception remaineth, though with ambiguity, euery one may conclude, that it is not certaine that ſinne is paſſed into all the poſterity, becauſe it is not certaine whether it be paſſed into the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin:</hi> and the rather, becauſe the reaſon which perſwadeth that excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may perſwade many more.

They added, that the world was much bound to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, for being contented to ſay that it confeſſeth, and thinketh that concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence remaineth in the baptized; or elſe men would be compelled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to feele that which they do. In the decree of reformation, it was expected that order ſhould haue been taken with the ſchoole-men and Canoniſts, with theſe for giuing diuine proprieties to the Pope, euen to call him God, attributing vnto him infallibilitie and making the ſame tribunall of both, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo, that he is more mercifull then CHRIST: with the Schoole men, who leauing the Scripture, or making it all doubtfull, haue made <hi>Aritoſtles</hi> Philoſophy the foundation of Theologie, euen making a queſtion whether there be a GOD, and diſputing of it on both ſides. It ſeemed ſtrange that it was vnknowen vntill then, that to preach was the office of Biſhops: that the abuſe of preaching vanities, or any thing but CHRIST was not remooued; that prouiſion was made againſt the open merchandizing of Preachers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of almes.

For the controuerſie of originall ſinne, being almoſt agreed in the Colloquies, from the Councell, from whence compoſition was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, a decree did proceed againſt the things accorded and it was written in the Emperours name, to his Miniſters in <hi>Trent,</hi> that they ſhould promote the reformation, and endeauour that the controuerſie of faith ſhould be deferred vntill the Proteſtants came, whom the Emperour was perſwaded hee could bring thither; or, at leaſt, vntill the Prelates of <hi>Germany</hi> did arriue, who would put themſelues into the iourney, ſo ſoone as the Diet was ended But they talked but a little while of theſe affaires of the Councell becauſe other accidents happened, which drew all mens eyes and mindes vnto them.</p>
            <p>For in <hi>Rome</hi> the 26. of Iune, the Cardinall of <hi>Trent</hi> concluded a league <note place="margin">The Cardinall of <hi>Trent</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth a league the 26. of June, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Pope and the Emperour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants.</note> betweene the Pope and Emperor, againſt the Proteſtants of <hi>Germanie,</hi> the treaty whereof was begun the yeere before in <hi>Wormes</hi> by Cardinall <hi>Farneſe,</hi> as hath been ſaid, and afterwards continued by other Miniſters.

There was one capitulation apart, which was kept ſecret, concerning the French Kings that if any Chriſtian; Prince during the warre, did mooue latines againſt the Emperour, the Pope ſhould bee bound to perſecute him with ſpirituall and temporall forces.</p>

            <p>But while the Pope and Emperour prepared againſt the Lutherans ſome thing beſide <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> the day after the Seſſion, the eighteenth of Iune, a Congregation was made, where after the accuſtomed prayers and inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">Iuſtification is to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in the next place.</note> of the holy Ghoſt, the Secretary read, in the Legates name, a writing, framed by the principal Theologues, in which it was propoſed, that hauing, by diuine inſpiration, condemned the hereſies concerning originall ſinne, the order of the things to bee handled did require, that the doctrine of the modernes, in the point of diuinegrace, which is the medicine of ſinne, ſhould be examined; and that the rather it was fit to follow the order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was obſerued by the <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion; all which the Councell meaneth to condemne. And the Fathers and Diuines were intreated to haue recourſe by prayer vnto the diuine aſſiſtance, and to be aſſiduous, and exact in their ſtudies, becauſe all the errours of <hi>Martin</hi> were reſolued into that point. For hauing vndertaken from the beginning to oppugne the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, he ſaw hee could not obtaine his purpoſe, except hee deſtroyed the workes of repentance, in defect whereof Indulgences doe ſucceede. And iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by faith onely, a thing neuer heard of before, ſeemed to him a good meanes to effect this; from whence he hath collected not onely that good workes are not neceſſary, but alſo that a diſſolute liberty in obſeruing the Law of GOD, and of the Church will ſerue the turne: hath denyed efficiencie in the Sacraments, authority of Prieſts, Purgatorie, ſacrifice of the Maſſe, and all other remedies for remiſſion of ſinnes. Therefore by a contrary way, he that will eſtabliſh the body of the Catholike doctrine, muſt ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw this hereſie of iuſtice by faith onely, and condemne the blaſphemies of that enemie of good workes.</p>
            <p>When the writing was read, the Emperours Prelates ſaid, that the more principall and important the point propoſed was, it ſhould bee the more maturely, and opportunely handled, that the ſending of the Cardinall <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druccio</hi> to the Pope ſhewed, that ſome buſineſſe was on foote, the which it was not fit to diſturbe, but in the meane ſpace to handle ſome thing of the reformation. The Papalins did, on the other ſide, inculcate, that it was no honour to interrupt the order begun, to handle together, in euery Seſſion, doctrine and reformation, and that after originall ſinne no other matter could be handled. The Legates, hauing heard all their opinions, concluded that to diſcuſſe the points, and prepare them, was not to define them, but that they could not bee determined without preparation before, (Which they
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17208:105"/>
ſaid onely to gaine time, and after to put themſelues in order, to execute what ſhould bee reſolued at <hi>Rome,</hi> betweene the Pope and the Cardinall, in the Emperours name. That to digeſt that matter, was not to hinder the reformation, becauſe in that the Diuines would bee imployed, and in this the Fathers and Canoniſts. With this reſolution it was concluded, that the Articles to bee diſcuſſed and cenſured, ſhould bee collected out of the bookes of <hi>Luther,</hi> out of the Colloquies, Apologies, and out of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Lutherans and Fathers. And three Fathers, and as many Diuines were deputed to ſet downe what ſhould bee diſcuſſed, and to frame the Articles.</p>
            <p>The next Congregation was held to order the matter of Reformation; <note place="margin">The diſcourſe of the Card. <hi>Monte</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> where the Cardinal of <hi>Monte</hi> ſayd, that the world hath complayned long ſince of the abſence of Prelats and Paſtoures, dayly demanding reſidence: that the abſence of the Prelats and other Curats from their Churches, is the cauſe of all the miſchiefes of the Church. For the Church may bee compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a ſhip, the ſinking whereof is aſcribed to the abſent Pilot, that ſhould gouerne it, if he were preſent. He ſhewed to them, that hereſies, ignorance, and diſſolution doe reigne in the people; and bad manners and vices in the Clergie, becauſe the Paſtours being abſent from the flocke, no man hath care to inſtruct thoſe, or correct theſe. By the Prelates abſence it is come to paſſe, that ignorant and vnlearned Miniſters haue beene promoted, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aſſumed to biſhoprickes, that were more fit for any other charge; for in regard they neede not execute their duety in perſon, no fitneſſe is neceſſary. So he concluded, that to eſtabliſh the point of reſidencie, was a generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for all the maladies of the Church; which alſo hath ſometimes beene vſed by Councels and Popes, but either for that the tranſgreſſions were then but few or for ſome other cauſe, it was not applyed with ſuch ſtrong and ſtrait bonds, as is neceſſarie now that the diſeaſe is come to the height: that is with a more ſeuere commandement, with more greiuous and fearefull pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and by meanes more eaſie to be executed.</p>
            <p>This was approued by the firſt voyces of the Prelates. But when <hi>Iacomo</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Veſone</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in fauour, of nonreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</note> 
               <hi>Corteſi,</hi> a Florentin, Biſhop of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſone,</hi> was to ſpeake, commending what had beene ſayd by others, he added, that as hee beleeued that the preſence of the Prelats and Curats in times paſt, was the cauſe of maintayning purity of faith in the people, and diſcipline in the Clergie, ſo hee could cleerely ſhew, that their abſence in theſe latter times, hath not beene the cauſe of the contrary ſubuerſion, and that the cuſtome of not reſiding hath beene brought in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe reſidence hath beene wholy vnprofitable. For the Biſhops could not then preſerue ſound doctrine amongſt the people, when the Friars and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners had authoritie to preach againſt their wills. It is well knowen that the innouation in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſprang from the Sermons of Fryar <hi>Iohn Techel,</hi> and of Friar <hi>Martin Luther;</hi> among the Suiſſes from the Sermons of Friar <hi>Samſon</hi> of <hi>Milan.</hi> And the reſiding Biſhop was able to doe nothing, but fight with diſaduantage, againſt theſe, who were armed with priuiledges. The Biſhop is not able to make the Clergie liue honeſtly, for that, beſides the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall exemption of all the Regulars, euery Chapter hath one, and there bee few particular Prieſts that want it. The Biſhop cannot prouide that fit men
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17208:106"/>
bee promoted to that charge, for the licences to promote, and the faculties which the titular Biſhops enioy, who ſuffer him not to vſe ſo much as the miniſtery of the <hi>Pontificals.</hi> And it may be ſaid in one word, that the Biſhops doe not reſide, becauſe they haue nothing to doe, or rather that they may not make greater inconueniences to ariſe, which would happen by their concurrence, and contention with priuiledged men. Hee concluded, that as he thought it fit to reſtore reſidency, ſo they ought to treat how to reſtore the Epiſcopall authoritie. The Biſhops that ſpake after this Prelate followed his opinion, that it was neceſſary to commaund reſidency, and to remooue the exemptions which do hinder it. And the Legats were enforced to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent, that both ſhould be conſidered of, and that euery one ſpeake his opinion of them, and that ſome Fathers ſhould be deputed to frame the Decree, that it might be examined.</p>
            <p>The deputies for collecting the Articles of iuſtification, hauing receiued <note place="margin">The Deputies for collecting the Articles diſſent about the manner of proceeding.</note> the extracts of the propoſitions noted by euery one to be cenſured, were not all of one opinion. One part deſired that foure or ſixe fundamental Articles of the new doctrine might bee choſen, and condemned, as was done in the matter of originall ſinne; alleadging that it was fit to follow the ſtile begun, and the example of the ancient Councels, which, hauing declared the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Article, condemned the hereſie, neuer deſcending to particular propoſitions, but condemning the bookes of the heretiques, in that vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall they comprehended all the pernitious doctrine; and ſo the honour of the Councell required. But the other part, aymed to put vnder cenſure all the propoſitions, which might receiue a bad conſtruction, that thoſe might be condemned, which in reaſon did deſerue it: ſaying, that it was the office of a Paſtor to diſcerne intirely the wholeſome graſſe from the hurtfull, and not to ſuffer the flocke to taſte of this. And if the example of ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels ought to be imitated, they ſhould imitate that of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which made ſo many, and ſo famous <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> againſt the doctrine of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> that they did containe whatſoeuer the heretique had ſaide, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of <hi>Africa,</hi> which deſcend to the condemnation of all the propoſitions of the ſectes.</p>
            <p>The firſt opinion did vndoubtedly propoſe a more eaſie way, and would <note place="margin">25. Articles concerning iuſtification.</note> haue pleaſed whoſoeuer deſired a ſpeedie ende of the Councell, and left a chinke open for agreement, which future times might produce. Yet the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was embraced, which ſaid it was good to examine all the propoſitions of the Lutheran doctrine, to cenſure and condemne that, which, after mature deliberation, ſhould ſeeme neceſſarie and conuenient. And 25. Articles were framed. 1. Faith without workes, is ſufficient to ſaluation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone doth iuſtifie. 2. Iuſtifying faith is a ſure truſt, by which one belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that his ſinnes are remitted for CHRIST; and thoſe that are iuſtified are bound to beleeue certainely that their ſinnes are remitted. 3. By faith onely wee are able to appeare before God, who neither regardeth, nor hath need of our workes: faith onely making vs pure, and worthy to receiue the Euchariſt, beleeuing that in it wee ſhall receiue grace. 4. Thoſe that doe honeſt things, without the holy Ghoſt, do ſinne, for that they do them with awicked heart, and it is ſinne to keepe the Commandements of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17208:106"/>
faith. 5. The beſt repentance is a new life, and the repentance of the life paſt is not neceſſary, neither doth the repentance of actuall ſinnes diſpoſe vs to receiue grace. 6. No diſpoſition is neceſſary to iuſtification; neither doth faith iuſtifie becauſe it diſpoſeth vs, but becauſe it is a meanes or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which the promiſe and grace of God is laid hold on, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. 7. The feare of hell helpeth not in gaining of iuſtice; yea, hurteth, and is ſinne, and maketh the ſinners worſe. 8. Contrition which ariſeth from the diſcuſſion, calling to minde, and deteſtation of ſinnes, weighing the grieuouſneſſe, multitude, and filthineſſe of them, or the loſſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe, and gaine of perpetuall damnation, maketh a man an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite and a greater ſinner. 9. The feares by which ſinners are terrified ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internally by God, or externally by Preachers, are ſinnes, vntill they are ouercome by faith. 10. The doctrine of the diſpoſitions deſtroyeth that of faith, and taketh conſolation from the conſciences. 11. Onely faith is neceſſary, and other things are neither commanded nor forbid, neither is ſinne any thing but incredulity. 12. Hee that hath faith is free from the precepts of the Law, and hath no neede of workes to bee ſaued; for faith giueth all abundantly, and alone fulfilleth all the Commandements, and no worke of a faithfull man is ſo bad as may accuſe or condemne him. 13. A man baptized cannot loſe ſaluation by reaſon of any ſinne whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, except hee will not beleeue, and no ſinne, but infidelity, ſeparateth vs from the grace of God. 14 Faith and workes are contrary, and workes cannot be taught without ſhipwracke of faith. 15. Externall workes of the ſecond Table are hypocriſie. 16. The iuſtified are ſet free, from guilt, and puniſhment, and ſatisfaction neither in this life nor after death is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and therefore there is no Purgatory, or ſatisfaction, which is part of Penance. 17. The iuſtified, though they haue the grace of God, cannot fulfill the Law, or auoide ſinnes, though mortall. 18. Obedience vnto the law in the iuſtified is weake, and vnpure in it ſelfe, not acceptable to God, but accepted for the faith of the perſon reconciled, who beleeueth that the remainders of ſinne are forgiuen him. 19. The iuſt ſinneth in euery good worke, and no worke maketh the ſinne veniall. 20. All the works of men, yea, of the moſt ſanctified, are ſinne: the workes of the iuſt are veniall by the mercie of God, but in the rigor of his iudgement are mortall. 21. Though the iuſt ought to doubt that his workes bee ſinnes, yet hee ought withall to be aſſured that they are not imputed. 22. Grace and iuſtice are nothing but the will of God, neither haue the iuſtified any inherent iuſtice in them, and their ſinnes are not aboliſhed, but onely remitted, and not imputed. 23. Our iuſtice is nothing but the imputation of the iuſtice of CHRIST, and the iuſt haue neede of a continuall iuſtification, and imputation of the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of CHRIST. 24. All the iuſtified are receiued into equall grace and glory, and all Chriſtians are equally great with the mother of God, and as much Saints as ſhee. 25. The workes of the iuſtified deſerue not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, neither can any confidence be put in them, but onely in the mercie of God.</p>
            <p>When the Articles were publiſhed, it was not ſo eaſie to ſet downe a courſe to handle them in the Congregations, as when originall ſinne was
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17208:107"/>
diſputed on. For in that matter they found the Articles already handled by the Schoole-men; but the opinion of <hi>Luther</hi> concerning iuſtifying faith, that it is a confidence and certaine perſwaſion of the promiſe of God, with the conſequences that follow, of the diſtinction between the Law &amp; the Goſpel, and of the quality of workes depending on the one, and the other, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thought of by any Schoole writer, and therefore neuer confuted or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed: ſo that the Diuines had worke enough, firſt to vnderſtand the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lutheran propoſitions, and that difference from thoſe that are determined in the Schooles, and then the reaſons, by which to diſtinguiſh them. It is certaine that in the beginning ſome of them, and the Fathers for the moſt part, did beleeue that the Proteſtants, denying Free-will, held opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that man, in externall actions, is like a ſtone, and when they attribute iuſtice to faith onely, without the concurrence of workes, thought him iuſt who beleeued only the Story of the Goſpel though, in other reſpects, he were neuer ſo wicked; and other ſuch abſurdities; the which, by how much the more they are aliene from common ſenſe, ſo much the harder they are to confute: as is vſuall in all opinions contrary to manifeſt appearance, and the generally receiued perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>The maior part of the Diuines, who then were aſcended to the number of fiue and fourty, was very tenacious of the opinions generally receiued in the Schooles, impatient of contradiction, where the Schoole men agreed, but where they agreed not, they did very much ſtand in defence of their owne opinion; and the Dominicans, more then the reſt, were wont to vaunt, that, for the ſpace of three hundred yeeres, the Church ouercame hereſies by their paines. Yet there wanted not ſome wiſe men, who ſuſpended their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, vntill the reaſons were weighed. In this number was <hi>Ambroſius Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> of <hi>Siena,</hi> a Dominican Friar, after created Biſhop of <hi>Minori, Andreus de Vega</hi> a Spaniard and Frauciſeane and <hi>Antonius Marinarus,</hi> a Carmelite. The Heremites, becauſe they were of the order which <hi>Martin Luther</hi> quitted, did affect to ſhew themſelues more contrary to him then all others, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Ierolamus Seripandus</hi> the Generall.</p>
            <p>In examining the Articles, the Theoloques that began (to facilitate the vnderſtanding of the three firſt) laboured to ſet downe what that faith which iuſtifieth is, and what workes it excludeth, diſtinguiſhing them into three ſorts; preceding grace, whereof the ſeuen following Articles vntill ten doe ſpeake, concurrent in the very moment with the infuſion of it, and ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent after grace receiued; of whicht he other eleuen doe ſpeake. That faith iuſtifieth muſt be preſuppoſed as vndoubted, for that it is ſayd and repeated by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> To reſolue what that faith is, and how it maketh a man iuſt, the opinions were different in the very beginning. For the Scripture attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting many vertues to faith, which ſome knew not how to apply to one onely, they thought the word was equiuocall, and did diſtinguiſh it into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſignifications, ſaying that ſometimes it is taken for an obligation to keepe promiſes: in which ſenſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd, that the incredulity of the Iewes <note place="margin">The ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of faith.</note> made not vaine the promiſe of God: ſometimes for the vertue to doe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, as when it is ſaid, if I ſhall haue ſo much faith as to remooue mountaines; ſomtimes for the conſcience, in which ſenſe it is ſaid, that, that worke, which is
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17208:107"/>
not conformable to faith is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; ſometimes for a truſt and confidence in God, that his Maieſtie will keepe his promiſes; ſo Saint <hi>Iames</hi> willeth vs to pray in faith, without doubting: Laſtly, for a perſwaſion and firme aſſent (though not euident) to the things reuealed by God. Others added other ſignifications, ſome to the number of nine, ſome to the number of fifteene.</p>
            <p>But Frior <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> oppoſing himſelfe againſt all, ſaid, that this <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Soto</hi> maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar opinion.</note> is a renting of faith, and a giuing of victory to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and that there were but two ſignifications; one, the trueth and reality of him that affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth or promiſeth, the other, the aſſent in him that heareth: that the firſt is in God, the ſecond is onely in vs: and of this laſt all places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſpeake of our faith, are vnderſtood: but to take faith for a truſt and confidence, is not onely an improper kinde of ſpeaking, but abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue, neuer receiued by Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> that truſt differeth little or nothing from hope; and therefore the opinion of <hi>Luther</hi> ought to bee held for an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted errour, or rather hereſie, that iuſtifying faith is a truſt and certainty in the minde of a Chriſtian, that his ſinnes for CHRIST, are remitted. <hi>Soto</hi> added, and was followed by the maior part, that that truſt could not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, becauſe it was temeritie, and a ſinne: for that no man, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, could aſſure himſelfe that hee was in grace, but ought alwaies to doubt. For the other part <hi>Catarinus</hi> held, and had many followers, <note place="margin">The opinions of <hi>Catarinus,</hi> and of <hi>Andre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Vega.</hi>
               </note> that iuſtification proceeded not from that truſt, yet that the iuſt might and ought to beleeue by faith, that hee is in grace. <hi>Andreus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ega</hi> ſet a third opinion on foote, that it was neither temerity, nor certaine faith, yet that one might haue a coniecturall perſwaſion without ſinne. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie could not be quitted, becauſe in it conſiſted the point of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the ſecond Article. Therefore it was firſt lightly diſcuſſed, then (the parties beeing warmed) it diuided, and held long in diſpute all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, for the reaſons and cauſes which ſhall bee declared. But all agreed, that iuſtifying faith is an aſſent to whatſoeuer is reuealed by God, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Church to be beleeued; which, ſometimes being ioyned with charity, ſometimes remaining without it, they did diſtinguiſh into two ſortes; one which is found in ſinners, which the Schooles call vnformed, ſolitary, idle, or dead, the other, which is onely in the good, working by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and therefore called Formed, efficacious, and liuely. And heere ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther controuerſie aroſe. For ſome thought that faith, vnto which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aſcribe ſaluation, iuſtice, and ſanctification, was onely the liuely faith, (as alſo the Catholiques of <hi>Germany</hi> held in the Colloquies) and included the knowledge of the things reuealed, the preparation of the will, and charity, in which the fulfilling of the whole Law is contained. And in this ſenſe it cannot be ſaid, that onely faith iuſtifieth, becauſe it is not alone, but formed with charity. Among theſe, <hi>Marinarus</hi> liked not it ſhould bee ſayd, that faith is formed with charity, becauſe that kind of ſpeach is not vſed by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> but onely that faith worketh by charity.</p>
            <p>Others vnderſtood, that iuſtifying faith was faith in generall, not ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was either liuely or dead, becauſe they doe both iuſtifie after diuers manners; either compleatly, as the liuely, or as a beginning or foundation,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17208:108"/>
as the hiſtoricall faith, and of this Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh when he attributeth iuſtice vnto it, no otherwiſe then as Philoſophie is contained in the alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet; that is, as in a baſis; which is as it were nothing, the principall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, that is to ſet the ſtatue vpon it. This ſecond opinion was ioint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained by the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> the other by <hi>Marinarus</hi> and his adherents. But the principall point of the difficulty was not touched; that is, whether a man is iuſt, and then doth iuſtly, or, by doing iuſtly, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth iuſt. They all agreed in one opinion, that to ſay onely faith doeth iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, was a propoſition of many fenſes, and all abſurd. For God and the Sacraments doe iuſtifie, as cauſes in their ſeuerall kindes: ſo that the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition hath that and many other exceptions. The preparation alſo of the ſoule to receiue grace, is a cauſe in its kinde, ſo that faith cannot exclude that ſort of workes. But the Articles concerning workes that goe before grace, all which <hi>Luther</hi> condemneth for ſinne, the Diuines cenſured for hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, rather by way of inuectiue then otherwiſe, condemning likewiſe of hereſie the opinion taken in generall, that humane workes, without faith, are ſinne: thinking it a cleare caſe, that many actions of men are indifferent, neither good nor euill; and that others there are, which though they bee not acceptable to God, yet are morally good, as the honeſt actions of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and Chriſtians which are ſinners, which to call honeſt and ſinnes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth a contradiction; and the rather, becauſe in this ranke are included the heroicall actions, ſo much commended by antiquity.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Catarinus</hi> maintained that man, without the ſpeciall helpe of God, can doe no worke, which may truely bee good, though morally, but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Catarinus</hi> his opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the value of workes.</note> ſtill. Therefore the workes of the Infidels, who are not excited by God to beleeue, and of the faithfull who are ſinners before God ſtirreth them vp to conuerſion, though they ſeeme honeſt to men, euen heroicall, yet are truely ſinnes, and hee that commendeth them, doth conſider them in generall, and according to externall appearance; but hee that ſhall examine the circumſtances of euery one, ſhall finde they are peruerſe: and that for this <hi>Luther</hi> was not to bee condemned; notwithſtanding hee ſayd that the Articles ought to bee cenſured, as they ſpeake of workes that follow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting grace, which are a preparation to iuſtification, as an abomination of ſinne, feare of hell, and other terrours of conſcience. For confirmation of his opinion, hee brought the doctrine of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> that to doe a good worke, the concurrence of all circumſtances is neceſſary, but the want of one onely is ſufficient for an ill. So that howſoeuer among the workes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in generall, ſome are indifferent, yet in the ſingular there is no <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> betweene hauing all the circumſtances, and wanting ſome. Therefore euery particular action is good or euill, neither is there to bee found any one indifferent. And becauſe amongſt the circumſtances the end is one, all workes referred to a bad end are infected; ſo that the Infidels referring all to a bad end, their actions are ſins though they ſeeme heroicall, to him that knoweth not their intention. Neither doth it make any difference whether the relation to a bad end be actuall or habituall, becauſe the iuſt doth merit, though hee referreth not the worke actually to God, but habitually onely. He ſaid further, alleaging Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> that it is ſinne not onely to refer the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:17208:108"/>
action to a bad end, but alſo not to referre it to a good; and becauſe hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended that, without the ſpeciall preuenting aſſiſtance of God, a man cannot referre any thing to God, he concluded, that no good morall worke can bee before. For this he alleadged many places of Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> to ſhew that hee was of this opinion. He alleadged alſo places of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Saint <hi>Proſper,</hi> S. <hi>Anſelmus,</hi> and of other Fathers. He produced <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Arimini,</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> who, in his booke againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> was cleerely of the ſame opinion, ſaying, it was better to follow the Fathers, then the Schoole-men, who are diuided, and rather to take the Scriptures for a ground, from whence true Theologie is taken, then the ſubtilties of Philoſophy, which the Schooles haue vſed: that himſelfe alſo was of that opinion, but hauing ſtudied the Scriptures and Fathers, had found the trueth. Hee alleadged the paſſage of the Goſpel; <hi>A bad tree cannot beare good fruit,</hi> with the amplifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which our Sauiour added, ſaying, <hi>Either make the tree good and the fruit good, or the tree euill and the fruit euill.</hi> He vſed alſo other arguments, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that nothing can be cleane to Infidels, becauſe their minde and conſcience is ſpotted.</p>
            <p>This opinion was very ſharpely impugned by <hi>Soto,</hi> proclaiming it hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Soto</hi> proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> to bee hereticall.</note> for inferring that man had not libertie to doe well, nor could obtaine his naturall end, which was to denie Free-will with the <hi>Lutheranes.</hi> Hee maintained a man might, by that ſtrength of nature, obſerue euery precept of the Law, in regard of the ſubſtance of the worke, though not in regard of the end; which was enough to auoid ſinne. Hee ſaid there were three ſorts of humane actions; one, the tranſgreſſion of the Law, which is ſinne; another, the obſeruation thereof, hauing charity for the end, which is meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and acceptable to God; the third mixt, when the Law is obeyed for the ſubſtance of the precept; which worke is morally good and perfect in its kinde, becauſe it accompliſheth the Law, making euery worke good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to morality, auoiding, by that meanes, all ſin. But he moderated this great perfection of our nature, by adding, that it was one thing to take heede of any one particular ſinne, and another to beware of all together; and ſayd that a man might auoid any one, but not all; by the example of him that had a veſſell with three holes, who could not ſtoppe them with two hands, but could ſtop which two of them he would, one remaining open of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. This doctrine did not ſatiſfie ſome of the Fathers. For though it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed that all workes are not ſinnes, yet it did not wholly ſalue Free-will, becauſe it will neceſſarily follow, that it is not free in auoiding all ſinne. But <hi>Soto</hi> giuing the title of good workes vnto theſe, knew not how to determine whether they were preparatory to iuſtification. It ſeemed to him they were, in regard of the goodneſſe of them: and it ſeemed they were not, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the doctrine of Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> approoued by Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and other good Diuines, that the firſt beginning of ſaluation proceedes from the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God. He auoyded theſe ſtraits by a diſtinction, that they were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory a farre off, but not neerely, as though giuing a remote preparation to the force of nature, the firſt beginning was not taken away from the grace <note place="margin">A new diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Soto.</hi>
               </note> of God.</p>
            <p>The Franciſcans thought that not onely this kinde of workes were good
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:17208:109"/>
and did truely and properly prepare to iuſtification, but alſo that they were truely meritorious in the ſight of God. Therefore <hi>Scotus,</hi> the authour of their doctrine, inuented a kinde of merit, which hee attributed to workes done by the force of nature onely, ſaying that in congruitie they deſerue grace by a certaine law, and infallibly and that a man, by naturall power on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may feele a ſorrow for ſinne, which is a diſpoſition, and merit of <hi>Congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,</hi> to aboliſh it: approouing a common ſaying of his times, that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">The doctrine of the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious works</note> faileth him that doth as much as hee is able. And ſome of that Order, paſſing thoſe bounds, did adde, that if God giueth not grace to him that doth what he can, hee would be vniuſt, vnrighteous, partiall, and an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of perſons. They clamoured with much ſtomacke and indignation, that it would bee a great abſurdity, if God made no difference betweene one that is naturally honeſt, and another drowned in all vices, and there would be no reaſon why hee ſhould rather giue grace to one then another. They alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> was of this opinion, and that otherwiſe a man is put into deſperation, and made negligent to doe well, and wicked men may excuſe their bad workes, and attribute them to the want of the aſſiſtance of God.</p>
            <p>But the Dominicans did confeſſe that Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> was of this opinion, when hee was yong, and after did retract it, when he was old. They did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <note place="margin">Is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Dominicans.</note> it, becauſe in the Councell of <hi>Orange,</hi> it is determined that no kinde of merit goeth before grace, and that the beginning ſhould bee attributed to God; ſaying, that the Lutherans hauing made ſuch exclamations for this congruous merit, it ought wholly to be aboliſhed, as indeede it was neuer heard of in the Church in ancient times, in ſo many controuerſies with the Pelagians. That the holy Scripture doth attribute our conuerſion to God, and that it is not fit to leaue the forme of ſpeach which it vſeth.</p>
            <p>For the preparations there was no difference in the ſubſtance of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. All held that after God doth ſtirre vs vp, feare and other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the malignity which is in ſinne doe ariſe. They ſaid that the opinion, that theſe things are bad, was hereticall, becauſe God exhorteth the ſinner, yea, mooueth him to theſe conſiderations, and it muſt not be ſayd that God mooueth to ſinne; and which is more, it is the office of a preacher to terrifie a ſinner by theſe meanes: and becauſe by the ſame meanes, all paſſe from the ſtate of ſinne to that of grace, it ſeemed very ſtrange that one cuuld no tpaſſe from ſinne to iuſtice, without the meanes of another ſinne. But for all this, they could not free themſelues from the difficultie on the contrary part; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all good workes may ſtand with grace, but that feare and other prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations cannot, and therefore are ſinnes. Friar <hi>Antonius Marinarus</hi> thought the difference was verball, and ſaid, that as paſſing from a great cold to a heat, one muſt paſſe by a leſſe degree of cold, which is neither a heat nor a new cold, but the ſame diminiſhed, ſo one goeth from ſinne to iuſtice by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and attritions, which are neither good workes, nor new ſinnes, but old ſinnes extenuated. But he was compelled to retract, becauſe all were againſt him Of the workes done in grace there was no difficulty amongſt them. For they all ſayd they were perfect, and merited ſaluation; and that <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion, that they are all ſinnes, is wicked and ſacrilegious: and holding it to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:17208:109"/>
be blaſphemie to ſay, that the bleſſed Virgine hath committed the leaſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſinne, they could not endure to heare that ſhee ſinned in euery action, and ſaid, that the earth and hell would open themſelues againſt ſo great blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.</p>
            <p>For cenſure of the 22. and 23. Articles, in the point of the eſſence of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine grace, it was a common conſideration, that the word <hi>Grace,</hi> in the firſt <note place="margin">All agreed to condemne <hi>Luther</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning works after grace.</note> ſignification, was vnderſtood for a beneuolence or good will, which, when it is in him that hath power, neceſſarily bringing foorth a good effect, that is, a gift or benefit, which is alſo called Grace. That the Proteſtants thought ſo meanly of the Maieſty of GOD, that it could doe no more then make vs partakers of his good will: but his omnipotencie required that we ſhould haue the benefit thereof in effect. And becauſe ſome man might ſay, that the diuine will onely, which is GOD himſelfe, can haue no greater thing to beſtow, and that to haue giuen vs his Sonne was the greateſt benefit, and that Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> to ſhew the great loue of GOD towards the world, allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged nothing elſe but that he had giuen vs his Sonne, they ſaid that theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits are common to all, and that it was fit he ſhould beſtow a particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to euery one. Therefore the Diuines haue added an habituall grace, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to euery iuſt man in particular, which is a ſpirituall qualitie created by GOD, infuſed into the ſoule, whereby it is made gratefull and acceptable to the diuine Maieſty, wherof though the Fathers ſpeake not in expreſſe termes, nor the Scripture, yet it is cleerely deduced from the word <hi>Iuſtifie;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effectiue, doth neceſſarily ſignifie to make iuſt, by the impreſſion of reall Iuſtice: which reality, becauſe it is no ſubſtance, can bee nothing elſe but a qualitie and habite.</p>
            <p>And vpon this occaſion there was much ſpoken againſt the Lutherans, who will not haue the verbe <hi>Iuſtificare</hi> to be effectiue, but iudiciall and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue, grounding themſelues vpon the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Tſadak,</hi> and the Greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſignifie to bee pronounced iuſt; and vpon many places of the New and Old Teſtament, and that it is vſed in that ſignification in the Latine tranſlation, alleadging for it places to the number of fifteene. But <hi>Soto</hi> excluded all thoſe of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which ſpake of our iuſtification, which he ſaid muſt needes be vnderſtood in an effectiue ſenſe: whereupon aroſe a great diſpute betweene him and <hi>Marinarus,</hi> who ſaid, one ſhould not ground himſelfe vpon ſo light a matter. But he ſaid the Article of habituall Grace could not be doubted of, as being decided in the Councell of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and by the common opinion of all Theologues: that this was to make ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, which cannot be deſtroyed, and not to ſay that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> when he ſaith that GOD iuſtifieth, doth not meane declaratorily: for it is manifeſtly againſt the Text, which maketh a iudiciall proceſſe, and ſaith, that none can accuſe or condemne GODs Elect, becauſe GOD doth iuſtifiethem: where the iudiciall words, to accuſe and condemne, doe ſhew that the word <hi>Iuſtifie,</hi> is iudiciall alſo.</p>
            <p>But the Franciſcans approued habituall grace, becauſe charity it ſelfe is an habit. And here was a ſharpe diſputation betweene them and the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, whether the habit of Grace be the ſame with the habit of Charity, as <hi>Scotus</hi> would, or diſtinct, as Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and neither party yeelding, they
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17208:110"/>
debated whether, beſides this Grace or inherent Iuſtice, the Iuſtice of CHRIST alſo bee imputed to the iuſtified, as if it were his owne; which they did in regard of the opinion of <hi>Alvertus Pighius,</hi> who confeſſing the inherent, added, that we muſt not truſt in that, but in the imputed iuſtice of CHRIST, as if it were ours. None doubted that CHRIST had merited for vs; but ſome blamed the word to <hi>Impute,</hi> and would haue it aboliſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not to bee found in Fathers: who contented themſelues with the words, Communication, participation, diffuſion, deriuation, applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, computation, and coniunction. Others ſaid, that, agreeing vpon the thing, they ought not to differ vpon the word, becauſe it ſignifieth preciſely the ſame that the others doe, which though not by all and often, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times was vſed. For this the 109. Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> was brought, and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ega</hi> defended, that, though the word be not found in the Scriptures, yet it is a moſt proper Latine word, to ſay that the iuſtice of CHRIST is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to mankind for ſatisfaction and merit, and that it is continually imputed to all that bee iuſtified, and doe ſatisfie for their owne ſinnes: but hee would not haue it ſayd, it was imputed as if it were ours. Whereunto it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſed that Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> vſeth to ſay, that the paſſion of CHRIST is communicated to the baptized for remiſſion, as if himſelfe had ſuſtained it and died, there was a long and great contention vpon his words. The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remite</hi> Generall held an opinion, that, in the Sacrament of Baptiſme, the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of CHRIST is imputed, becauſe it is communicated wholly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely; but not in penance, when our ſatisfactions are alſo required. But <hi>Soto</hi> ſayd, the word <hi>Imputation,</hi> was moſt popular and plauſible, becauſe it ſignified, at the firſt ſight, that all ſhould bee acknowledged from CHRIST; but yet that he did euer ſuſpect it, in regard of the bad conſequences which the Lutheranes draw from thence. That is, that this onely is ſufficient, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inherent righteouſnes: that the Sacraments doe not conferre grace: that the puniſhment is aboliſhed together with the guilt: that there remaineth no place for ſatisfaction: that all are equall in grace, iuſtice, and glorie: whence they deduce alſo that abominable blaſphemie, that euery iuſt man is equall to the bleſſed <hi>Virgin.</hi> This admonition begat ſuch a ſuſpicion in the hearers, that there appeared a manifeſt inclination to condemne the word for hereticall, though reaſons were effectually replyed to the contrary. The contentions betweene the Theologues, did certainly ariſe from the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate affection they bare to their owne ſect, and were cheriſhed by diuers, for diuers ends. By the Imperialiſts, to conſtraine them to abandon iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. By the Courtiers, to find a way to ſeparate the Councell, and ſo to auoid the imminent reformation. And by others, to free themſelues from incommodities, which they feared would be greater, by reaſon of the dearth, <note place="margin">Contentions in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell are cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by diuers for diuers ends.

roote them out, the Councell was alreadie begun, hee bewailed, aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the obſtinacie of the heretikes, who contemne and refuſe to obey it, and to ſubmit themſelues to the determination thereof. For remedie whereof he had made a League with the Emperour, to reduce them to the obedience of the Church by force of Armes. Hee therefore wiſhed them all to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto GOD by prayers, faſtings, confeſſions, and communions, that GOD of his Diuine Maieſtie, would giue a good iſſue to this warre, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for his glory, exaltation of the Church, and extirpation of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies.</p>

Therefore hee doeth preſcribe them, as perfidious, rebels, ſeditious, guilty of high treaſon, and enemies of the publike peace: and commandeth that none doe aſſiſt them, or be linked with them, abſolueth the nobility and people of their dominions from their Oath of fidelitie, including all thoſe in the <hi>Bando</hi> who perſeuere to obey them.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of the warre alleadged by the Emperour grieued the Pope, and <note place="margin">The Pope and the Emperour are offended one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers cauſes of the warre.</note> that of the Pope grieued the Emperor, becauſe both their ends were hindred. For though the Pope pretended that he had publiſhed this <hi>Manifeſt,</hi> that all the people of Chriſtendome might implore the ayde of God, to fauour the Emperours Armes, yet both he and euery man of iudgement knew very well that it was to giue notice to <hi>Germany,</hi> and the whole world, that the warre was for Religion: which the ſimpler ſort alſo did know a little after. For his letter to the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> before mentioned, and a copie of the Capitulations made with <hi>Madruccio,</hi> were publiſhed. The Pope croſſed <hi>Caſar</hi> in this, becauſe hee deſired the ſuppreſſion of the Proteſtants, without the exaltation of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and therefore to ballance them well, hee meant to conſtraine all the profeſſors of the new Religion to vnite againſt him. And it is certaine that the Popes action hindered the Emperours deſignes. For deſiring the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> to continue their league with the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the rebels, the Euangelikes anſwered that they would firſt be ſure that the warre was not for Religion. So it hapened, that, the warre being but newly begun, diſeords were already ſowed betweene the Princes, lately confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
            <p>The Potentates of <hi>Italie</hi> were amazed, and ſaw the Popes vſuall wiſdome <note place="margin">The Princes of <hi>Italie</hi> doe cenſure the Pope for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this warre.</note> was wanting to keepe warre farre from <hi>Italie,</hi> and the Princes beyond the mountaines in an equall ballance of ſtrength; who in the ſame inſtant had fayled in both. For if the Emperour had ſubdued <hi>Germanie, Italie</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at his diſcretion, and <hi>France</hi> not been able to reſiſt. If the Emperor had been ouercome, the Dutchmen would haue paſſed into <hi>Italie.</hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps theſe reaſons running in the Popes minde, perſwaded him when hee
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:17208:111"/>
had concluded the leagte, to ſecure himſelfe againſt the Emperour with the counterpooſe of <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Caeſar,</hi> beſides his diſtaſte for the <hi>Iubelie,</hi> ſuſpected alſo that the Pope, hauing obtained his end of making warre againſt the Proteſtants; would diſſolue the Councell, vnder pretence to deferre it vntill the warre was ended, or for ſcare of the armes which the Proteſtants prepared in <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia.</hi> Hee knew this was the aime of all the Court, negotiated with him more then fiue and twenty yeeres, and that the Biſhops aſſembled in <hi>Trent,</hi> euen his owne, had the ſame minde, for the incommodities which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered there. Hee feared the <hi>Lutherans</hi> would ſay, if the Councell were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, that it was aſſembled onely to finde a pretence of making warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; and that the Catholiques of <hi>Germanie</hi> would thinke, that, the intereſts of religion and reformation being layd aſide, hee would endeuour onely to ſubdue them. Hee doubted alſo, that going on to handle the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſed points, as already they had originall ſinne, and meant to handle (as he was aduertiſed) iuſtification, hee might bee hindered in ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which otherwiſe hee might haue made, giuing hope to the Cities that their reaſons ſhould be heard, to ſeparate them from the Princes of the league. He ſaw clearely it was neceſſary the Councell ſhould remaine open, and yet meddle only with reformation: but that it was impoſſible to obtaine it without the Pope conſented with him. Therefore hee ſent to certifie him in diligence, that hee would imploy all his ſpirit and forces to make <hi>Trent</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Emperor doth earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreat the Pope that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may bee handled in the Councell, and that it might not be diſſolued.</note> ſecure, though there went a fame of the Proteſtant armies in <hi>Sueuia.</hi> That it was neceſſary to maintaine the Councell, that they might anſwere the backebitings and calumnies, which would bee ſpred againſt them both, if it were diſſolued. Hee earneſtly prayed him to keepe the Councell open and not to handle the controuerſies, becauſe his purpoſe was to compell the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, his adherents, by authoritie, and his enemies by force of armes, to be preſent, and ſubmit themſelues. But in the meane time he deſired him not to hinder his excellent deſeigne, ſhutting the doore vpon them, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary decrees, made in their abſence. That this could not continue long, and that hee hoped to ſee the end of this ſummer. Therefore, that hee ſhould bee contented that now reformation onely ſhould bee treated of, or, if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were, they ſhould touch matters of ſmall weight onely, that, when they were defined, they might not offend the Proteſtants. Hee ordained alſo, that his Ambaſſadour in <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould make the ſame inſtance to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates. And being informed that <hi>Santa Croce</hi> was inclined to any kinde of diſſolution of the Councell, hee charged his Ambaſſadour to giue him a nip, and tell him, that if, in this, hee did croſſe his Maieſtie, hee would cauſe him <note place="margin">He threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate <hi>Santa Croce.</hi>

            <p>The Pope, though hee would faine haue beene free from the Councell, which the Court deſired alſo, yet hee thought it neceſſary to gratifie the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, in keeping it open, and not handling controuerſies. But to treat one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">The Pope &amp; Court did not like that refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation onely ſhould bee handled.</note> of Reformation neither pleaſed him nor the Courtiers.

But that the Biſhops and Diuines might haue entertainment, the Cardinall <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Croce</hi> held an aſſembly of learned men in his houſe, where they treated of the ſamethings, but familiarly, and without ceremony.</p>

But he could obtaine neither of theſe from the Emperour, whoſe end was quite contrary, to entertaine the Lutherane Princes who were with him, and that the Cities might not waxe obſtinate againſt him for it. The Cardinall perceiuing hee could not tary in the field in any other quality, with the Popes dignity, and his owne, he remained in <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> and faining himſelfe to be ſicke, expected his Grandfathers anſwere, whom he had aduertiſed of all.</p>
            <p>They now being in a readineſſe on both ſides, though either had a great armie, and forced one another, preſenting alſo the battaile when they ſaw their aduantage, and though each of them had many good occaſions to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue ſome notable victory, yet they were not embraced by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, becauſe the Elector and the <hi>Landgraue</hi> had equall authority ouer <note place="margin">The equall authority of the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Landgraue</hi> bringeth great diſaduantage to their army.</note> them: a gouernment which euer ſucceedeth ill in armes: and becauſe the Emperour knowing this, that he might be Conquerour without blood, and not giue the enemies occaſion to ſet their affaires in better order, expected that time ſhould put into his hand a certaine victory, in ſtead of one that was doubtfull, expoſing himſelfe to the hazard of a battell, whereby nothing of moment or conſequence was done.</p>
            <p>The Legats in <hi>Trent,</hi> now freed from the Souldiers, did regulate the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, according to the firſt ſtile, reducing them to ordinary dayes, and be thinking themſelues how to driue the time, according to the purpoſe of the Pope. They found no other meanes, but to ſhew that the importance of the matter required an exact diſcuſſion, and to prolong the diſputations of the Diuines, giuing an entrance to new matters; whereof there could not want occaſion, in regard that by reaſon of connexion, or intemperancie of wit, Doctors do euer eaſily paſſe from one ſubiect to another. They reſolued alſo to cheriſh the differences and varietie of opinions; a thing eaſie to bee done, aſwell for the naturall inclination of man to ouercome in diſputations, as becauſe in the Schooles, eſpecially of the Fryars, too much obſtinacie in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their owne ſect, is very vſuall. <hi>Monte,</hi> who was of an ingenuous <note place="margin">Card. <hi>Monte</hi> cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble ſo wel as the other Legate <hi>Santa Crace.</hi>
               </note> diſpoſition, thought it would be hard, and could not promiſe to be conſtant in ſo long a diſſimulation, as he ſaw was neceſſary.

the <hi>Anathematiſines,</hi> it was propoſed to depute Fathers to compoſe them. And there were named three Biſhops, and three Generals, and <hi>Sonta Croce</hi> firſt of all. Who hauing made a modell of the Canons, and propoſed it to be diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Congregations following, the ſame diſputations did returne, of the certaintie of Grace, of the morall workes of Infidels and ſinners, of the merit of congruitie, of imputation, of the diſtinction of Grace and charitie; and thoſe that were intereſted in the opinions ſpake more earneſtly, becauſe the Cardinall gaue them an edge, by ſhewing that the matters were of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <note place="margin">

The controuerſie of the certaintie of Grace onely, held the diſputants in exerciſe many dayes, and made obſtinate, and diuided into two parts, not onely the Diuines, but the Prelates alſo. Yet the queſtion was not cleered by the diſputation, but more obſcured.</p>
            <p>In the beginning (as hath beene deliuered) one part ſaid that certaintie <note place="margin">A difference in opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Grace.</note> of Grace was preſumption; the other, that one might haue it meritoriouſly. The ground of the firſt was, that Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> Saint <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the Schoolemen thought ſo, for which cauſe the maior part of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans were of the ſame opinion. Beſides the authoritie of Doctors, they alleadged for reaſons, that God would not that man ſhould be certaine, that hee might not bee lifted vp in pride, and eſteeme of himſelfe, that hee might not preferre himſelfe before others, as hee that knoweth himſelfe to bee iuſt would doe, before manifeſt ſinners: and a Chriſtian would ſo become drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, careleſſe, and negligent to doe good. Therefore they ſaid that incertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was profitable, and meritorious beſides, becauſe it is a paſſion of the mind, which doth afflict it, and being ſupported, is turned to merit. They alleadged many places of the Scripture alſo; of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that <hi>a man knoweth not whether hee bee worthie of hate or loue;</hi> of Wiſedome, which commandeth not to bee without feare of the ſinne pardoned, of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> to <hi>worke out our ſaluation with feare and trembling;</hi> of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaid of himſelfe, <hi>though my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence accuſe mee not, yet am I not thereby iuſtified.</hi> Theſe reaſons and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies <note place="margin">The opinion of <hi>Seripandal, Vega,</hi> &amp; <hi>Soto.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Catarinus,</hi> and <hi>Marinarus,</hi> had other places of the ſame Fathers, to the <note place="margin">The opinion of <hi>Catarinus</hi> &amp; <hi>Marinarus</hi>
               </note> contrary; which ſhewed they had ſpoken accidentally in this particular, as the occaſions made moſt for their purpoſe, ſometimes to comfort the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, ſometimes to repreſſe the audacious. Yet they kept them cloſe to the authoritie of the Scripture. They ſaid that to as many as it is read in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel that CHRIST hath forgiuen ſinnes, to all them hee ſayd, <hi>Beleeue that your ſinnes are forgiuen.</hi> And it would bee an abſurditie that CHRIST ſhould giue an occaſion of temeritie and pride, or, if the contrary were profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or a merit, that hee would depriue all men of it. That the Scripture bindeth vs to giue God thankes for our iuſtification, which cannot be giuen except wee know wee haue obtained it; for to giue them when wee are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, would bee moſt fooliſh and impertinent. That Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doeth plainely confirme the certaintie, when hee putteth the Corinthians in mind to know that CHRIST <hi>is in them, except they bee reprobates.</hi> And when hee
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:17208:113"/>
ſaith, we haue receiued from God the Spirit to know what is giuen vs by his Diuine Maieſtie; and more cleerely: that <hi>the boly Spirit doeth beare witneſſe to our ſpirit, that wee are the ſonnes of God:</hi> and it is much to accuſe them of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, who beleeue the holy Ghoſt that ſpeaketh with them. For Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſaith that the holy Ghoſt doeth neuer ſpeake vnto vs, but doth make vs know that it is he that ſpeaketh. After this hee added the words of CHRIST in Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> that the world cannot receiue the holy Ghoſt, becauſe it ſeeth him not, nor knoweth him, but that the Diſciples ſhall know him, becauſe he ſhall dwell in them. <hi>Catarinus</hi> did fortifie himſelfe ſtrongly, by ſaying, that it was the opinion of a man in a dreame, to defend that grace is voluntarily receiued, when wee know not whether wee haue it or not; as if, to receiue a thing willingly, it bee not neceſſary that the willing receiuer ſhould know it is giuen him, that he doeth really receiue it, and that, after it is receiued, he doeth poſſeſſe it.</p>
            <p>The force of theſe reaſons made them firſt retire a little, who cenſured the opinion of temeritie, and yeeld that there might bee a coniecture, though not an ordinary certainetie. Yet they acknowledged a certaintie in the Martyrs, in the newly baptized, and in ſome by ſpeciall reuelation; and from coniecture they were brought to call it morall faith: and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ega,</hi> who, in the beginning, admitted probability onely, ouercome by theſe reaſons, and beginning to fauour the certaintie, for feare of conforming himſelfe to the Lutheran opinion, ſayd, that there was ſo much certaintie as did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all doubt, and could not be deceiued, yet that it was not Chriſtian faith, but humane and experimentall. And as hee that is hote, is ſure hee is ſo, and ſhould want ſenſe if hee doubted, ſo hee that hath grace in him, doeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it, and cannot doubt; yet it is by the ſence of the minde, not by Diuine reuelation. But the other defenders of certaintie, conſtrained by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries to ſpeake plainely, whether they thought a man might haue it, or whether hee were bound vnto it, or whether it were a Diuine or humane faith, they came to ſay, that it being a faith giuen to the Teſtimonie of the holy Ghoſt, it could not bee ſayd to bee in our liberty, euery one being bound to beleeue Diuine reuelations, and that it muſt needes bee called Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine faith.</p>
            <p>And they being preſſed with the obiection, that if that faith bee not equall to the Catholike faith, it doeth not exclude all doubt, if it bee equall, then the iuſt ought as much to beleeue he is iuſtified, as the Articles of faith, <hi>Catarinus</hi> did anſwere, that that faith was diuine, of equall certaintie, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all doubt, as well as the Catholike; but that it was not the Catholike it ſelfe. Hee affirmed that the Faith which one giueth to Diuine reuelations, made vnto ones ſelfe, in particular, was diuine, and excluded all doubt, but when it is receiued by the Church, then it is made Vniuerſall, that is, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and that this onely concerneth the Articles of faith; which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, in regard of certainty and excluſion of doubt, is not ſuperiour to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate faith, but exceedeth it onely in vniuerſality. So all the <hi>Prophets</hi> had firſt priuate faith of the things reuealed to them by God, of which, after they were receiued by the Church, they had a Catholike faith. This opinion ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hard at the firſt hearing, and the adherents of <hi>Catarinus,</hi> who were all the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17208:113"/>
Carmelites, becauſe <hi>Iohn Bacon,</hi> their Doctour, was of that opinion, and the Biſhops of <hi>Sinigaglia, Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Salpi,</hi> did willingly goe ſo farre; but afterwards, the reaſon beeing weighed and diſcuſſed, it was ſtrange how it was receiued by a principall part of the Prelates, <hi>Soto</hi> crying out that it was too much in fauour of the Lutherans, &amp; others defending that <hi>Luther</hi> ought not to be cenſured if he had ſaid that, after iuſtification, that kind of faith doth follow, but becauſe he ſaith that is the faith which iuſtifieth.</p>
            <p>They anſwered the reaſons of the other part, that the Schoolemen ought not to bee regarded, who ground themſelues vpon Philoſophicall reaſons; that one cannot iudge of diuine motions; that the authority of <hi>Salomon</hi> was not to the purpoſe; for ſaying none knoweth whether hee bee worthy of loue or hatred, applying it heere, it would conclude, that the moſt wicked ſinner, who perſeuereth, cannot know that hee is in diſgrace with God: that the ſaying of Wiſedome cannot bee applied to this, and the tranſlation doeth deceiue, becauſe the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> doth not ſignifie ſinne pardoned, as the tranſlation is, but expiation or pardon, and the words of the wiſe man are an admonition to the ſinner not to lay ſinne vpon ſinne by too much confidence of pardon to come, or paſt: that it was not fit to ground an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of faith vpon an error of an interpreter. Thus did the ſame men, who then had made the vulgar edition authenticall, ſpeake of it; which euery one may alſo obſerue out of the bookes printed by them, who aſſiſted at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the approbation. They ſaid, that to worke with feare &amp; trembling was an Hebrew phraſe, which ſignifieth not ambiguitie, but reuerence, becauſe feare &amp; trembling are vſed by ſeruants to their maſters, euen when they are commended by them, and know they are in fauour; that the place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> did fauourthem, when he ſpake of iuſtification. For ſaying I am not conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of any want, yet thereby am I not iuſtified, he would inferre, but I am iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by ſomething elſe, and ſo would prooue the certaintie. But the true ſenſe is, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of defect in the office of preaching, and ſaith, my conſcience doth not accuſe me of defect in any thing, yet I dare not ſay I haue wholly ſatisfied, but I reſerue all to the iudgement of God.</p>
            <p>Hee that had not ſeene the memorials of thoſe who had part in theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, and how farre different that was which they printed, would not beleeue how much was ſpoken vpon this article, and with how much heate, not onley by the Diuines, but the Biſhops alſo, all ſeeming to vnderſtand the trueth, and to haue it on their ſide: ſo that <hi>Santa Croce</hi> ſaw there was more neede of a bridle, then ſpurres, who deſired to make an end of it by intreating them to paſſe to ſomething elſe, and to diuert the controuerſie. It was twice propoſed in congregation of the Prelates to leaue this queſtion, as ambiguous, long, and troubleſome; yet they returned to it, being drawen by their affections. At laſt the Cardinall, ſhewing they had ſaid enough, and that they ſhould conſider againe of the things ſpoken, to reſolue on them more maturely, obtained of them to ſpeake of preparatiue workes, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the Law: vpon which occaſion the matter of Free will was brought in by many, and not neglected by the Cardinall, &amp; he propoſed whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would haue that particular alſo handled together with the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it did ſo cohere with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it could not be handled ſeuerally. Therfore
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17208:114"/>
Prelates and Diuines were deputed to collect Articles, out of the workes of the Lutherans, that they might be cenſured.</p>
            <p>The Articles were, 1. God is the totall cauſe of our workes, good and euill: and the adultery of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the cruelty of <hi>Manlius,</hi> and the treaſon of <hi>Iudas,</hi> are workes of God, as well as the vocation of <hi>Saul.</hi> 2. No man hath power to thinke well or ill, but all commeth from abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and in vs is no free will, and to affirme it, is a meere fiction. 3. Free <note place="margin">Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Free will.</note> will, ſince the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> is loſt, and a thing onely tirular, and when one doeth what is in his power, hee ſinneth mortally; yea, it is a thing fained and a title without realitie. 4. Free will is onely in doing ill, and hath no power to doe good. 5. Free will mooued by God, doeth by no meanes cooperate, and followeth as an inſtrument without life, or as an vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature. 6. That God conuerteth thoſe onely whom hee will, though they will not, and ſpurne againſt it.</p>
            <p>Vpon the two firſt Articles they rather ſpake in a tragicall manner, then <note place="margin">The diſcuſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the articles.</note> Theologicall; that the Lutheran doctrine was a frantique wiſedome; that mans will as they make it, is prodigious; that thoſe wordes, a thing of title onely, a title without realitie, are monſtrous; that the opinion is impious and blaſphemous againſt God; that the Church hath condemned it againſt the <hi>Manichees, Priſcillianiſts,</hi> and laſtly, againſt <hi>Aballardus,</hi> and <hi>Wigleffe,</hi> and that it was a follie, againſt common ſence, euery one proouing in himſelfe his owne libertie; that it deſerueth not confutation, but, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, chaſtiſement, or experimentall proofe. That <hi>Luthers</hi> Schollers perceiued the folly, and to moderate the abſurditie, ſayd after, that man had libertie in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, politicall, and oecumenicall actions, and in matters of ciuill iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that which euery one but a foole knoweth to proceede from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and election, but denied libertie in matters of diuine iuſtice onely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marinarus</hi> ſayd, that as it is fooliſh to ſay, no humane action is in our power, ſo it is no leſſe abſurd to ſay that euery one is, euery one finding by experience that hee hath not his affections in his power, that this is the ſence of the Schooles, which ſay, that wee are not free in the firſt motions; which freedome becauſe the Saints haue, it is certaine, that ſome freedome is in them, which is not in vs. <hi>Catarinus,</hi> according to his owne opinion, that without Gods ſpeciall aſſiſtance, a man cannot doe a morall good, ſaid there was no liberty in this, and therefore that the fourth Article was not ſo eaſily to bee condemned. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ega,</hi> after hee had ſpoken with ſuch am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguitie, that hee vnderſtood not himſelfe, concluded, that betweene the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines and the Proteſtants there was no difference of opinion. For theſe concluding now that there is liberty in Philoſophicall iuſtice, and not in ſupernaturall, in externall workes of the Law, not in internall and ſpirituall, it is to ſay preciſely with the Church, that one cannot doe ſpirituall workes, belonging to religion, without the aſſiſtance of God. And though hee ſaid that all indeuour was to be vſed for compoſition, yet hee was not gratefully heard, it ſeeming in ſome ſort a preiudice, that any of the differences might bee reconciled; and they were wont to ſay, that this is a point of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies, a word abhorred, as if, by that, the Laitie had vſurped that authority which is proper to Councels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:17208:114"/>
A great diſputation aroſe amongſt them, whether it bee in mans power to beleeue or not beleeue. The Franciſcans following <hi>Scotus,</hi> did denie it; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as knowledge doth neceſſarily follow demonſtrations, ſo faith doth ariſe neceſſarily from perſuaſions, and that it is in the vnderſtanding, which is a naturall agent, and is naturally mooued by the obiect. They alledged experience, that no man can beleeue what hee will, but what ſeemeth true; adding that no man would feele any diſpleaſure, if hee could beleeue hee had it not. The Dominicans ſaid, that nothing is more in the power of the will then to beleeue, and, by the determination and reſolution of the will onely, one may beleeue the number of the ſtarres is euen.</p>
            <p>Vpon the third Article, whether free will bee loſt by ſinne, very many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> being alledged, which expreſſely ſay it, <hi>Soto</hi> did inuent, becauſe hee knew no other meanes to auoyd them, that true liberty is equiuocall; for either it is deriued from the Noune, <hi>Libertas, freedome,</hi> or from the Verbe <hi>Liberare, to ſet free:</hi> that in the firſt ſence it is oppoſed to neceſſity, in the ſecond to ſeruitude; and that when Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſayd, that free-will was loſt, hee would inferre nothing elſe, but that it is made ſlaue to ſinne and Satan. This difference could not bee vnderſtood, becauſe a ſeruant is not free, for that hee cannot doe his owne will, but is compelled to follow his Maſters; and by this opinion <hi>Luther</hi> could not bee blamed for intitling a booke, of <hi>ſeruile will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many thought the fourth Article abſurd; ſaying, that liberty is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be a power to both the contraries: therefore that it could not bee ſaid to bee a liberty to euill, if it were not alſo to good. But they were made to acknowledge their error, when they were told that the Saints, and bleſſed Angels in heauen, are free to doe good, and therefore that it was no inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that ſome ſhould bee free onely to doe euill.</p>
            <p>In examining the fifth and ſixt Articles, of the conſent which free-will gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to diuine inſpiration, or preuenting grace, the Franciſcans and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicans were of diuers opinions. The Franciſcans contended that the will beeing able to prepare it ſelfe, it hath liberty much more to accept or refuſe the diuine preuention, when God giueth aſſiſtance, before it vſeth the ſtrength of nature. The Dominicans denied that the workes preceding the vocation are truely preparatory, and euer gaue the firſt place to God. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there was a contention betweene the Dominicans themſelues. For <hi>Soto</hi> defended, that although a man cannot obtaine grace, without the ſpeciall preuenting aſſiſtance of God, yet the will may euer ſome way reſiſt and refuſe it, and when it doth receiue it, it is becauſe it giueth aſſent, and doth will ſo: and if our aſſent were not required, there would bee no cauſe why all ſhould not be conuerted. For, according to the Apocalyps, GOD ſtandeth alwayes at the gate, and knocketh: and it is a ſaying of the Fathers, now made common, that God giueth grace to euery one that will haue it, and the Scripture doeth alwayes require this conſent in vs; and to ſay other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were to take away the libertie of the will, and to ſay that God vſeth violence.</p>
            <p>Friar <hi>Aloiſius Catanea</hi> ſaid to the contrary, that God worketh two ſorts of preuenting grace in the minde, according to the doctrine of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:17208:115"/>
the one ſufficient, the other effectuall; to the firſt the will may conſent or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, but not to the ſecond, becauſe it implieth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction that efficacity can be reſiſted. For proofe hee alledged places of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cleere expoſitions of Saint, <hi>Auſtine.</hi> Hee anſwered, that it ariſeth hence that all are not conuerted, becauſe all are not effectually preuented. That the feare of ouerthrowing free-will is remooued by Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> that things are violently mooued by a contrary cauſe, but neuer by their owne: and God being the cauſe of the will, to ſay it is mooued by God, is to ſay it is mooued by it ſelfe. And hee condemned, yea mocked the Lutherans manner of ſpeech, that the will followeth, as a dead or vnreaſonable creature; for bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſonable by nature, mooued by its owne cauſe, which is God, it is mooued as reaſonable, and followeth as reaſonable. And likewiſe that God conuerteth, though men will not, and ſpurne at him. For it is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the effect ſhould ſpurne againſt the cauſe. That it may happen that God may effectually conuert one, that before hath ſpurned againſt ſufficient preuention; but afterwards cannot, becauſe a gentleneſſe in the will moued, muſt needes follow the efficacie of the diuine motion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soto</hi> ſaid, that euery diuine inſpiration was onely ſufficient, and that that whereunto free-will hath aſſented, obtaineth efficiency by that conſent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is vneffectuall, not by the defect of it ſelfe, but of the man. This opinion hee defended very fearefully, becauſe it was oppoſed, that the diſtinction of the reprobate from the elect, would proceede from man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the perpetuall Catholique ſence; that the veſſels of mercy are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by grace, from the veſſels of wrath. That Gods election would be for workes foreſeene, and not for his good pleaſure. That the doctrine of the Fathers, and of the African and French Councels againſt the Pelagians, hath alwayes publiſhed, that God maketh vs to will, which is to ſay, that hee maketh vs conſent. Therefore giuing conſent to vs, it ought to bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the diuine power; or elſe he that is ſaued would no more be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to God, then he that is damned, if God ſhould vſe them both alike.</p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding all theſe reaſons, the contrary opinion had the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall applauſe, though many confeſſed, that the reaſons of <hi>Catanea</hi> were not reſolued, and were diſpleaſed that <hi>Soto</hi> did not ſpeake freely, but ſaid that the will conſenteth in a certaine maner, ſo that it may in a certaine maner reſiſt: as though there were a certaine maner of meane betweene this affirmation and negation. The free ſpeech of <hi>Catanea,</hi> and the other Dominicans, did trouble them alſo, who knew not how to diſtinguiſh that opinion, which attributeth iuſtification to conſent, from the Pelagian: and therefore they wiſhed them to take heede of leaping beyond the marke, by a too great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to condemne <hi>Luther;</hi> that obiection beeing eſteemed aboue all, that, by this meanes, the diuine election or predeſtination, would bee for workes foreſeene; which no Diuine did admit. This drew them to ſpeake alſo of Predeſtination.</p>
            <p>Therefore it was determined, by reaſon of the connexion, to draw Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, <note place="margin">Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, drawen out of the writings of the <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians.</hi>
               </note> in this ſubiect, alſo from the doctrine of the Proteſtants. In the bookes of <hi>Luther,</hi> in the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> confeſſion, and in the <hi>Apologies,</hi> and <hi>Colloquies,</hi> there was nothing found that deſerued cenſure: but much in the writings of the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17208:115"/>
               <hi>Zuinglians;</hi> whence theſe following Articles were drawen. 1. For Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination and reprobation, that man doth nothing, but all is in the will of GOD. 2. The Predeſtinated cannot be condemned, nor the Reprobate ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. 3. The elect and predeſtinated onely are truly iuſtified. 4. The iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified are bound by faith to beleeue they are in the number of the Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. 5. The iuſtified cannot fall from grace. 6. Thoſe that are called, and are not in the number of the Predeſtinated, doe neuer recelue grace, 7. The iuſtified is bound to beleeue, by faith, that hee ought to perſeuere in iuſtice vntill the end. 8. The iuſtified is bound to beleeue for certaine, that in caſe he fall from grace, he ſhall receiue it againe.</p>
            <p>In examining the firſt of theſe Articles, the opinions were diuers. The <note place="margin">The diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note> moſt eſteemed Diuines amongſt them thought it to be Catholique, and the contrary hereticall; becauſe the good Schoole Writers, Saint <hi>Thomas Scotus,</hi> and the reſt, do ſo thinke, that is, that GOD, before the creation, out of the maſſe of mankind, hath elected by his onely and meere mercy, ſome for glory, for whom he hath prepared, effectually, the meanes to obtaine it; which is called to predeſtinate. That their number is certaine and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, neither can there be any added. The others not predeſtinated cannot complaine, for that GOD hath prepared for them ſufficient aſſiſtance for this, though indeed none but the elect ſhall be ſaued. For the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall reaſon, they alleadged, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> hauing made <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> a paterne of the predeſtinated, and <hi>Eſau</hi> of the Reprobate, he produceth the decree of GOD, pronounced before they were borne, not for their workes, but for his owne good pleaſure. To this they ioyned the example of the ſame Apoſtle, that as the Potter of the ſame lumpe of clay, maketh one veſſell to honour, another to diſhonour, ſo GOD of the ſame maſſe of men, chuſeth and leaueth whom he liſteth. For proofe whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the place, where GOD ſaith to <hi>Moſes; I will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy, and I will ſhew pitty, on whom I will ſhew pitie.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle concludeth, <hi>that it is not of him, that willeth, or of him that runneth, but of God who ſheweth mercy:</hi> adding after, that <hi>God ſheweth mercy on whom hee will, and hardeneth whom he will.</hi> They ſayd further, that for this cauſe the counſell of the diuine predeſtination, and reprobation is called, by the ſame Apoſtle, the height and depth of wiſedome, vnſearchable, and incomprehenſible. They added places of the other Epiſtles, where he ſaith; <hi>We haue nothing but what wee haue receiued from God,</hi> that <hi>wee are not able of our ſelues, ſo much as to thinke well;</hi> and where, in giuing the cauſe why ſome haue reuolted from the faith, and ſome ſtand firme, he ſaid, it was becauſe <hi>the foundation of God ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſure, and hath this Seale; the Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> They added di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers paſſages of the Goſpel of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and infinite authorities of Saint <hi>Austin,</hi> becauſe that Saint wrote nothing in his old age, but in fauour of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>But ſome others, though of leſſe eſteeme, oppoſed this opinion, calling it hard, cruell, inhumane, horrible, impious, and that it ſhewed partialitie in GOD, if, without any motiue cauſe, he elected one, and reiected another; and vniuſt, if he damned men for his owne will, and not for their faults, and had created ſo great a multitude to condemneit. They ſay it deſtroyed free wil,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17208:116"/>
becauſe the elect cannot finally doe euill, nor the reprobate good; that it caſteth men into a gulfe of deſperation, doubting that they bee reprobates, that it giueth occaſion to the wicked of bad thoughts, not caring for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but thinking that if they bee elected, they ſhall not periſh, if repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, it is in vaine to doe well, becauſe it will not helpe them. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that not onely workes are not the cauſe of Gods election, becauſe that it is before them, &amp; eternall, but that neither works foreſeen can moue GOD to predeſtinate, who is willing, for his infinite mercie that all ſhould bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and to this end prepareth ſufficient aſſiſtance for all, which euery man, hauing free-will, receiueth or refuſeth, as pleaſeth him: and GOD, in his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie, foreſeeth thoſe who will receiue his helpe, and vſe it to good, and thoſe who will refuſe; and reiecteth theſe, electeth and predeſtinateth thoſe. They added, that otherwiſe there was no cauſe why GOD in the Scripture ſhould complaine of ſinners, nor why hee ſhould exhort all to repentance and conuerſion, if they haue not ſufficent meanes to get them: that the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient aſſiſtance, inuented by the others, is vnſufficient, becauſe in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it neuer had or ſhall haue any effect.</p>
            <p>The firſt opinion as it is myſticall and hidden, keeping the mind humble and relying on GOD, without any confidence in it ſelfe, knowing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of ſinne, and the excellencie of diuine grace, ſo this ſecond was plauſible and popular, cheriſhing humane preſumption, and making a great ſhew; and it pleaſed more the preaching Fryars, then the vnderſtanding Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines. And the Courtiers thought it probable, as conſonant to politique rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. It was maintained by the Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Salpi</hi> ſhewed himſelfe very partiall. The defenders of this, vſing humane reaſons, preuailed againſt the others, but comming to the teſtimonies of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they were manifeſtly ouercome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Catarinus</hi> holding the ſame opinion to reſolue the places of Scripture, which troubled them all, inuented a middle way: that GOD of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hath elected ſome few, whom he will ſaue abſolutely, for whom hee hath prepared moſt potent, effectuall, and infallible meanes; the reſt he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for his part they ſhould be ſaued, and to that end hath prouided ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent meanes for all, leauing it to their choice to accept them, and bee ſaued, or refuſe them and be damned. Amongſt theſe there are ſome who receiue them &amp; are ſaued, though they be not of the number of the elect; of which kind there are very many. Others refuſing to cooperate with God, who wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their ſaluation, are damned. The cauſe why the firſt are predeſtinated, is onely the will of GOD; why the others are ſaued, is the acceptation, good vſe, and cooperation with the diuine aſſiſtance, foreſeene by GOD; why the laſt are reprobated, is the foreſeeing of their peruerſe will, in refuſing, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing it. That Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and all the places of Scripture allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the other part, where all is giuen to GOD, and which doe ſhew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibilitie, are vnderſtood onely of the firſt, who are particularly priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and in others, for whom the common way is left, the admonitions, exhortations, and generall aſſiſtances are verified, vnto which hee that will giue care and follow them, is ſaued, and he that wil not, periſheth by his own fault. Of thoſe fewe who are priuiledged aboue the common condition,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17208:116"/>
the number is determinate, and certaine with God, but not of thoſe who are ſaued by the common Way depending on humane libertie, but onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the foreknowledge of the workes of euery one. <hi>Catarinus</hi> ſaid hee wondred at the ſtupidity of thoſe, who ſay the number is certaine and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and yet they adde that others may bee ſaued, which is as much as to ſay that the number is certaine, and yet it may bee inlarged; and likewiſe of thoſe who ſay, that the reprobates haue ſufficient aſſiſtance for ſaluation, though it be neceſſary for him that is ſaued to haue a grat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, which is to ſay, a ſufficient vnſufſicient.</p>
            <p>Hee added that Saint <hi>Austins</hi> opinion was not heard of before his time, and himſelfe confeſſeth, it cannot be found in the works of any, who wrote before him, neither did himſelfe alwayes thinke it true, but aſcribed the cauſe of Gods wil to merits, ſaying, God taketh compaſſion on, &amp; hardeneth whom he liſteth. But that will of GOD cannot bee vniuſt, becauſe it is cauſed by moſt ſecret merits; and that there is diuerſitie of ſinners, ſome, who though they be iuſtified, yet deſerue iuſtification. But after the heate of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation againſt the Pelagians tranſported him to thinke, and ſpeake the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Yet when his opinion was heard, all the Catholikes were ſcandalized, as S, <hi>Proſper</hi> wrote to him. And <hi>Genadius</hi> of <hi>Marſcilles</hi> 50. yeeres after, in his iudgement which he maketh of the famous writers, ſaid that it happened to him according to the words of <hi>Salmon,</hi> that in much ſpeaking one cannot auoyd ſinne, and that by his fault, exaggerated by the enemies, the queſtion was not then riſen, which might afterwards bring forth hereſie; whereby the good Father did intimate his feare, of that which now appeareth, that is, that, by that opinion, ſome Sect, and diuiſion might ariſe.</p>
            <p>The cenſure of the ſecond Article was diuers, according to the three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated opinions. <hi>Catarinus</hi> thought the firſt part true, in regard of the efficacie of the Diuine will, toward thoſe who are particularly fauoured, but the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond falſe, concerning the ſuffiencie of Gods aſſiſtance vnto all, and mans libertie in cooperating Others aſcribing the cauſe of Predeſtination in all to humane conſent, condemned the whole Article, in both parts. But thoſe that adhered to S. <hi>Austin,</hi> and the common opinion of the Theologues, did diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it, and ſaid it was true in a compounded ſence, but damnable in a diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: a ſubtiltie which confounded the mindes of the Prelates; and his owne, though hee did exemplifie it, by ſaying; hee that mooueth cannot ſtand ſtill, it is true in a compound ſence becauſe it is vnderſtood, while hee moueth; but in a diuided ſence it is falſe, that it is in another time. Yet it was not well vnderſtood, becauſe applying it to his purpoſe, it cannot bee ſaid, that a man predeſtinated can bee damned, in a time when he is not predeſtinated, ſeeing hee is alwayes ſo: and generally the diuided ſence hath no place where the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident is inſeparable from the ſubiect. Therefore others thought to declare it better, ſaying that God gouerneth and mooueth euery thing, according to its proper nature, which in contingent things is free, and ſuch, as that the Act may conſiſt together with the power to the oppoſite; ſo that with the act of predeſtination, the power to reprobation and damnation doeth ſtand. But this was worſe vnderſtood then the firſt.</p>
            <p>The other Articles were cenſured with admirable concord. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17208:117"/>
the third and ſixt, they ſayd it hath alwayes beene an opinion in the Church, that many receiue diuine grace, and keepe it for a time, who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards doe loſe it, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine are damned. There was alleadged the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Saul, Solomon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudas,</hi> one of the twelue, a caſe more euident then all, by the words of CHIST to the FATHER; <hi>I haue kept in thy Name al that thou haſt giuen mee, of which not one hath periſhed but the ſonne of perdition.</hi> To theſe they added <hi>Nicholas,</hi> one of the ſeuen Deacons, and others firſt commended in the Scriptures, and then blamed; and for a concluſion of all, the fall of <hi>Luther.</hi> Againſt the ſixt they particularly conſidered, that vocation would be an impious deriſion, when thoſe that are called, and nothing is wanting on their ſide, are not admitted: that the Sacraments would not bee effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for them, all which things are abſurd. But for cenſure of the firſt, the authoritie of the Prophet was brought, directly contrary in termes, where God ſaith, that, <hi>if the iuſt ſhall abandon iustice, and commit iniquitie, I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his good workes.</hi> The example of <hi>Dauid</hi> was added, who committed murther and adultery; of <hi>Magdalene</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who denied CHRIST. They derided the follies of the Zuinglians, for ſaying the iuſt cannot fall from grace, and yet ſinneth in euery worke. The two laſt were vniformely condemned of timeritie, with exception of thoſe vnto whom God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a ſpeciall reuelation, as to <hi>Moyſes</hi> and the Diſciples, to whom it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed that they were written in the booke of heauen.</p>
            <p>The examination of the Diuines, concerning Free-will and Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beeing ended, and the <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> in thoſe matters framed, they were ioyned to thoſe of iuſtification, according to their fit places. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto oppoſition was made by ſome in one part, by ſome in another, where there appeared any word which might preiudicate their opinion. But <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus Coccus,</hi> Arch biſhop of <hi>Corfu,</hi> conſidered, that, by the Theologues, the Articles were cenſured, with many limitations and amplifications, which ought to be inſerted in the <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> that the propoſition might not abſolutely be condemned, which might receiue a good conſtruction; and the rather, becauſe it is humanitie, to make the moſt fauourable interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and charitie, not to thinke euill. Diuers did contradict; firſt in regard of the practiſe of the ancient Councels, which haue condemned hereticall propoſitions without limitation, naked, as they haue been deliuered by the heretikes; eſpecially becauſe it is ſufficient in matter of faith, for condemning an article, that it hath one falſe ſence which may cauſe the vnaduiſed to erre. Both the opinions ſeemed reaſonable, the firſt, becauſe it was fit to knowe which ſence was condemned, the ſecond, becauſe it was not for the honour of the Councel, to limit the propoſitions of heretikes. Hereunto was added, that all the Canons were thus compoſed, reciting the opinion which was to be condemned, and alleadging, for cauſe thereof the places of Scripture, and doctrine of the Church, vnto which it was oppoſite. The Canons were made, according to the forme of the Councell of <hi>Orange,</hi> like to thoſe of originall ſinne, in the preceeding Seſſion. But the reading of them proouing long and tedious, and the mixture of trueth and falſhood, of things reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and approoued not very intelligible; the Biſhop of <hi>Sinigaglia</hi> put them fitly in minde of a remedie for both inconueniences; that it was better to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:17208:117"/>
ſeparate the Catholike doctrine from the contrary, and make two Decrees; in one to make a continuated declaration, and confirmation of the doctrine of the Church, in the other to condemne, and <hi>anathematize</hi> the contrary. The aduiſe pleaſed all, and ſo it was reſolued; and firſt the <hi>anathematiſmes</hi> were framed apart; and then paines taken to make the other Decree. And this they called the Decree of the doctrine, and that the Canons; which <note place="margin">The Decree of the doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

It is certaine, that to determine thoſe things, Congregations were held, conſiſting partly of Theoloques, partly of the Prelates, to the number of one hundred, and that, from the beginning of September vntill the end of Nouember, there paſſed not a day, in which the Cardinall did not meddle with that which was done before, and change ſomething. The memoriall of theſe mutations remaineth: whereof I will rehearſe two, as a taſt of many, which it would bee tedious to recount. In the firſt point of doctrine, it was firſt written, by common conſent, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Gentiles, by vertue of Nature, nor the Iewes, by the law of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> could free themſelues from ſinne; and becauſe many did hold that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion did remit ſinnes, they ſuſpected that theſe words might preiudice their opinion, though S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath, in expreſſe termes, ſaid the ſame, in more then one place. The Cardinal, to ſatisfie theſe men, in the place where it was ſayd <hi>(Per ipſam etiam legem Moyſi)</hi> changed, and ſaid <hi>(Per ipſam etiam litterant legis Moyſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>)</hi> &amp; euery ordinary Diuine might eaſily iudge, how well the word <hi>literam</hi> did befit that place. In the beginning of the eight point, thoſe that manetained certainety of grace, were not contented it ſhould be ſayde, A mans ſinnes are not omitted by the certainetie of remiſſion, and becauſe one is confident in it. And the Cardinall gaue them ſatisfaction, by excluding the reall certainety, and putting in the roome, boaſting, &amp; confidence in that onely. And in the concluſion of that point, euery one might plainely ſee, that the cauſe ought to haue beene giuen, for that no man can certainely know that he hath obtained grace. But to ſatisfie one part, hee added, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety of faith; and the Dominicans, thinking this was not enough, vrged him to adde Catholique. But becauſe the adherents of <hi>Catarinus</hi> were not contented, in ſtead of thoſe words, Catholique faith, it was ſaid, Faith, which cannot be ſubiect to falſhood. This contented both ſides. For one party inferred, then, that certainty of faith which can be had herein, may bee falſe, and therefore is vncertaine, the other inferred, that this certainety could haue no doubt of falſehood while it remained, but by changing from the ſtate of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:17208:118"/>
of grace to the State of ſinne, it may become falſe; as all contingent truthes, by alteration of their ſubiects are made falſe. But the Catholike faith is not onely certaine, but vnchangeable, becauſe the ſubiect of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or paſt, which cannot be altered.</p>
            <p>And truly, concerning theſe particulars, it is not fit to robbe the Cardinall of his due praiſe, who knew how to ſatisfie men, euen obſtinate in contrary opinions.

Theſe two opinions do not only differ, almoſt in all the Articles, but in many of them, are expreſly contrary. Both which workes were printed in the yeere 1548. and hee that ſhall reade them, obſeruing that they doe giue very often, interchangeable and doubtfull ſences to the words of the Councell, wil maruaile how theſe two perſons, the chiefe for learning, and eſtimation, who had greater part therein then others, did not know the onely ſence and true ſcope of the Synode: of which alſo, ſome few others, of thoſe which were intereſted, hauing written diuerſly, I could neuer finde, whether that aſſembly did agree in one ſence, or whether there was vnitie of words onely. But to returne to the Cardinall, when the Decree was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">The Decree is ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and approued there.</note> by all in <hi>Trent,</hi> he ſent it to the Pope, and the Pope gaue it to the Fryars, and learned men of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be conſulted of and it was approoued by them, becauſe euery one might vnderſtand it in his owne ſence.</p>
            <p>I haue rehearſed altogether what was done in matter of faith, that I migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> not diuide things that are connexed. But in the meane time, ſome dayes <note place="margin">Reformation is handled.</note> were ſpent about the reformation; and in thoſe congregations it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſet downe the qualities, requiſite in the promotion of the greater Prelats, and Miniſters of the Church. And very graue ſayings were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with great oſtentation, but there was no way found how thoſe things, whereof they ſpoke might be obſerued. For where the Kings haue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, they ſaw not with what bonds to tie them: where election hath place, the chapter doth conſiſt of great and mighty perſons: for the reſidue, all dignities are conferred by the Pope, and more then two thirds of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices <note place="margin">The point concerning the qualities of the Prelats is omitted.</note> are reſerued to the Apoſtolike Sea; vnto which it is not fit to preſcribe a law. Whereupon, after many and long diſcourſes, it was concluded, that it was better to leaue the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>The diſcourſes in point of reſidency, were neither fewer nor ſhorter; <note place="margin">The point of reſidence is handled.</note> which ended not in the reſolution which was neceſſary, &amp; deſired by many, and made ſome confuſion then, and prepared matter for other times. For the vnderſtanding whereof, it is neceſſary to reſume this matter from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
            <p>The Eccleſiaſticall Degrees were not originally inſtituted as dignities, preheminencies, rewards, or honours, as now they are, and haue beene, many <note place="margin">A diſcourſe of the author concerning reſidency.</note> hundred yeeres, but as miniſteries, and charges, otherwiſe called by Saint
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17208:118"/>
               <hi>Paul,</hi> works, and thoſe that exerciſe them, are called by CHRIST our LORD in the Goſpel, Worke-men; and therefore no man could then enter into co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation to abſent himſelfe from the execution thereof in his owne perſon: and if any one (which ſeldome happened) retired from the worke, it was not thought reaſonable, he ſhould haue either title or profit. And though the miniſteries were of two ſorts, ſome anciently called, as now they are, with care of ſoules: others of temporal things, for the ſuſtenance and ſeruice of the poore and ſicke, as were the Deaconries, and other inferiour workes, all held themſelues equally bound to that ſeruice, in perſon; neither did any thinke of a ſubſtitute, but for a ſhort time, and for great impediments, much leſſe to take another charge, which might hinder that. The Church being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, where there were many Chriſtians, and free from perſecutions, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Miniſters was inſtituted, to ſerue in the Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies, aſwell in reading the diuine Scriptures, as in other functions, to ſtirre vp de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion. There were inſtituted alſo Colledges of Miniſters, which might in common apply themſelues to ſome charge, and others as Seminaries, from whence to take Miniſters inſtructed already. Theſe of the Colledges, not hauing any perſonall charge, ſeeing the Congregation did adminiſter, as well with one more, as with one leſſe, ſometimes, by reaſon of ſtudie, or greater inſtruction, or for ſome other cauſe, were abſent from the Church, one for a ſhort time, another for along, without hauing title, charge, or profit. So Saint <hi>Ierom,</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Antioch,</hi> but without any particular Cure, and <hi>Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> in the ſame manner, of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paulinus,</hi> ordained Prieſt of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> did reſide but little. But when the number of them increaſed, they did degenerate, and were called vagabond Clerkes, becauſe that manner of liuing made them odious, who are often ſpoken of in the Lawes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell conſtitutions of <hi>Iuſtinian.</hi> But neuer any thought to holde the title of an office, or inioy the profit, without doing ſeruice, but onely, after the yeere ſeuen hundred, in the Weſt Church, when the Eccleſiaſtical miniſteries were changed, and made dignities, and honours, and rewards for ſeruices done. And as before a perſon was choſen fit for the neceſſitie of the Church, ſo afterward a degree, dignitie, or emolument was fitted to the qualitie of the perſon; from whence aroſe the exerciſing of the miniſtery by a ſubſtitute. This abuſe hath drawen in another by conſequence; that is, to thinke ones ſelfe diſobliged, not onely to miniſter, but to bee preſent, and aſſiſt him that laboureth in his place. And indeed where the induſtry of the perſon is not choſen for the worke, but a place and degree is prouided for the perſon, there is no reaſon hee ſhould bee bound to labour for himſelfe, or aſſiſt him that doeth. The diſorder proceeded ſo farre, that it would haue ouerthrowen the Clergie, if the Popes had not in part reſiſted, commanding that Prelates and other Curates, though they might exerciſe the charge by ſubſtitutes, yet ſhould be tied to aſſiſtance in the place, which they called reſidence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto alſo they bound the Canons, without conſtraining other beneficed Clerkes vnto it, not ſo much as ſpeaking of them, but leauing them to the cuſtome, or rather abuſe brought in: by which ſilence it came to paſſe, that they thought themſelues obliged. Neither did this voluntarie deceipt diſpleaſe the Pope, who ſaw very well that it would end in the greatneſſe of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:17208:119"/>
the Court. And hence aroſe the pernicious, and neuer ſufficiently deteſted diſtinction, of Benefices of reſidence, and not reſidence; which followed as well in deed as in doctrine, without any bluſh of abſurditie, which it did euidently bring with it: that is, to giue a title and ſalarie without Obligation. And to palliate it, or rather to make it more ſhamefull, whereas the Canoniſts haue a maxime conuincing this abſurditie, that is, that euery Benefice is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for an office, they haue expounded it, vnderſtanding by office, the houres or prayers of the Breuiarie: ſo that a reuenue of a thouſand or tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, or more crownes is giuen for this onely, to take a Breuiarie in hand, and read as faſt as one can, in a low voice, not marking any thing but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the words. But the diſtinction of the Doctours, and the prouiſion of the Popes augmented the abuſe in the ſhort time: For without thoſe ſome of the beneficed men might perhaps haue made conſcience of it, but with them, they thinke the abuſe is iuſtified, as a thing lawfull. And for the Curates, the Popes diſpenſation was neuer denyed to any, that ſought it by that way by which euery thing is obtained at <hi>Rome.</hi> So that the poore onely doe reſide, and thoſe that gaine by it: and the abuſe, firſt a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by the Popes lawes did, by the diſpenſations, not onely leape to the height, but ſpread it ſelfe abroad, and infected the earth. After the ſtirres of <hi>Germanie</hi> for Religion; which gaue occaſion to ſpeake of and deſire refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, euery one aſcribing the miſchiefe to the negligence, and ſmall care of the Prelates, deſiring to ſee them at the gouernement of their Churches, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting the diſpenſations, which cauſed them to be abſent, diſcourſes were made of their Obligation; and ſome Pious men, amongſt whom was Friar <hi>Thomas Caietan,</hi> Cardinall, affirmed that the Obligation of reſidence was by the Law of GOD. And it happened, as it doeth, in all things, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding paſſion perſwaded the more rigid opinion, and more ſtrict Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and made the diſobligation more hard. This cauſed them to adde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, the vigor of the Law of GOD. The Prelates, ſeeing the miſchiefe, and deſiring it ſhould be excuſeable, and a ſmall fault, would needes beleeue, that they were not bound by GOD, but by the Pope, whoſe diſpenſation, or ſilence, did ſaue them. With theſe preuious diſpoſitions of doctrine, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Great contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies in the Councell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout reſidence</note> was propoſed in the Councell, as hath beene ſaid: which becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a ſmall controuerſie in the beginning, a greater in the progreſſe, and in the end (which was in the yeeres 1562. and 1563.) greateſt of all, it will not be vnſeaſonable to make ſome recapitulation, and to recount ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occurrences.</p>
            <p>Therefore though the Articles firſt propoſed, were but to adde greater bonds, and puniſhments, to the precepts, to remooue the impediments, and <note place="margin">A controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie whether reſidence be <hi>de iure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine.</hi>
               </note> facilitate the execution, and all agreed, alleadging perſwaſions out of the old and new Teſtament, Canons of the Councels, doctrine of the Fathers, and out of the inconueniences which ſprang from the non-reſidencie, yet the maior part of the Diuines, eſpecially the Dominicans, did determine that the obligation was by the Law of God. Friar <hi>Bartholomew Caranza,</hi> and Friar <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> Spaniards, were the moſt principall authors. The moſt grounded reaſons they brought were, that Biſhoprickes are founded by CHRIST, as miniſteries and workes, and ſo require a perſonall action, which
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17208:119"/>
a man abſent cannot performe, that CHRIST, deſcribing the qualitie of a good ſhepheard, ſaith, that hee giueth his life for the flocke, knoweth the ſheepe by their names, and walketh before them. The Canoniſts and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Prelates did diſpute, that the obligation was by the Eccleſiaſticall law, alleadging that anciently neuer any non-reſident was reprehended as a tranſgreſſour of the Law of God, but of the Canons onely. That <hi>Timothie,</hi> though Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> was long in his iourney, by order of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> That it was ſayd to Saint <hi>Peter, Feede the Lambes;</hi> which is vnderſtood of all, and yet hee cannot bee euery where preſent: ſo the Biſhop may fulfill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of feeding; without reſidence. They anſwered the contrary reaſons, that the conditions of a Paſtor, propoſed by CHRIST, doe agree to none but CHRIST himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Friar <hi>Ambroſius Catarinus,</hi> though a Dominican, was contrary to the reſt. He ſayd, the Biſhopricke inſtituted by CHRIST is one onely, which the Pope hath: the inſtitution of the others is by the Pope; who, as hee diuideth the quantity and number of the ſheepe to bee fed, ſo hee preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth alſo the manner and qualitie. Therefore it belongeth to the Pope, to appoint euery Biſhop, to attend the flocke, by himſelfe, or his ſubſtitute, and may allot vnto him either much or little, and depriue him alſo of the power of feeding. <hi>Thomas Campeggius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Feltre,</hi> anſwered another way, that the Biſhop, as Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> teſtifieth, is the inſtitution of CHRIST, but the diuiſion of Biſhoprickes was after inſtituted by the Church: that CHRIST gaue the charge of feeding to all the diſciples, but tied them not to a place, as the actions of the Apoſtles, and of their Diſciples doe ſhew; the aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this portion of the flocke to one, and that to another, was an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall inſtitution, to gouerne better.</p>
            <p>Theſe things were handled by the Biſhops with much paſſion. The Spaniards did not onely adhere to, but cheriſh the opinion, that it was <hi>de</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Spaniſh ſecret in this point.</note> 
               <hi>iure diuino,</hi> hauing a ſecret, which they communicated onely amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to make great the Epiſcopall authority. For if it were once deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they had the charge from CHRIST to gouerne their Church, it would bee decided alſo, that they haue from him authority neceſſarie for it, which the Pope could not reſtraine. Theſe deſignes were ſmelled out, by thoſe that leaned to the Court, therefore in regard of the importance of the matter, they alſo incouraged the maintainers of the contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Legats thought it better to withſtand the danger, by diſſembling their knowledge of it: and, aiming at this marke, ſaid for the preſent, that the matter was hard, and had need of greater examination; that where the controuerſie is betweene the Catholikes, they ought not to condemne one part, for feare of making a ſchiſme, and ſowing contentions, that they may ioyntly indeauour to confute the Lutherans. Therefore, that it were better to deferre the declaration, by what right it is due, vntil another Seſſion. Some thought it ſufficient to renew the old Canons and Decretals in this matter, and ſayd, they were ſeuere enough, becauſe they inflicted depriuation for a puniſhment, and reaſonable enough, becauſe they admitted lawfull excuſes. There remained to find a way that diſpenſations might not be granted, and that was ſufficient. Others thought it neceſſary to adde new puniſhments,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:17208:120"/>
and remoue the impediments; which was of the greateſt importance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe being taken away, reſidencie would follow; and that it was no matter from whence the obligation came, ſo it were executed; and that this being done, the matter would be better diſcuſſed. It pleaſed the maior part that the one and the other ſhould be done: whereunto the Legates g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>; vpon condition, that the diſpenſations ſhould not bee ſpoken againſt, but, to cauſe them not to be deſired, that the impediments ſhould bee taken away, which come by exemptions wherein there was as much ſpoken, and with no leſſe con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

The neighbour Biſhops, whoſe Churches, becauſe they were vnder one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince, had commerce, did gouerne themſelues alſo in common by Synods; and to make the gouernement more eaſie, attributing much to the Biſhop of the principall City, they made him as it were Head of that body: and by a more ample communion, which all the Prouinces of one perfecture or great gouernement held together, the Biſhop of the City where the Ruler did reſide; gained a certaine ſuperiority, by cuſtome. Theſe prefectures were, the Imperiall City of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Cities adioyning; the prefecture of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which gouerned <hi>Egypt, Libya,</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis:</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> for <hi>Syria,</hi> and other Prouinces of the Eaſt: and in the other leſſer prefectures, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Greeke, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> the ſame was obſerued. This gouernement, brought in, and approoued by cuſtome onely, which found it commodious; was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the firſt Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> vnder <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and ordained by a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non that it ſhould continue: and euery one was ſo farre from putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of this order; that the Biſhop of Ieruſalem hauing many honourable preheminences, perhaps becauſe it was the place where our Sauiour Chriſt conuerſed in the fleſh, and was the fountaine of Religion, the Councell of <hi>Nice</hi> did ordaine that thoſe honours ſhould ſtill remaine, but ſo that nothing was detracted from the Metropolitan, then Biſhop of <hi>Ceſarea.</hi> This gouernement; which hath bin euer held in all the Churches of the Eaſt; was altered in the Latine, becauſe many great Monaſteries being built, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by Abbates of great fame and worth, who by their conſpicuous vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, made the Biſhops afraid, there aroſe ſome emulation betweene theſe and thoſe: and the Abbates, to free themſelues from theſe inconueniences, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reall, or fained, and to couer their ambition, to withdraw themſelues from the ſubiection which they owed, did obtaine of Popes to bee receiued vnder the protection of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and immediately vnder the ſubiection of the Pope. This being profitable for the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he that obtaineth priuiledges, is bound to maintaine the authority of him that granteth them, ſuddenly all the Monaſteries were exempted. The Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17208:120"/>
alſo of Cathedrall Churches, conſiſting for the moſt part of Regulars, by the ſame pretences, did obtaine exemption. Finally, the Cluniacenſian and Ciſterſian Congregations were all wholly exempted, With great inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Popes authority, which came to haue ſubiects in all places, de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fended and protected by the Papacie, and interchangeably defenders and protectors. The inuention was not commended by Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in that time, and was of the Ciſterſian Congregation: yea, hee admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Pope <hi>Eugenius;</hi> to conſider thereof, that all were abuſes, that it ought not to be well taken if an Abbat did refuſe to obey the Biſhop, and the Biſhop the Metropolitane: that the militant Church ſhould take example by the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, where no Angel euer ſaid, I will not be vnder the Archangel. But <hi>Bernard</hi> would haue ſaid more, if hee had liued in the times following, when the Mendicant Orders, obtained, not onely a generall exemption, from the Epiſcopall authority, but power alſo to build Churches, in any place what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, and to adminiſter the Sacraments in them. But in theſe laſt ages the abuſe went on ſo farre, that euery petty Prieſt did obtaine, with a ſmal charge, an exemption from the ſuperiority of his Biſhop, not onely in cauſes of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but alſo to be ordained by whom he liſteth, and in ſumme, not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Biſhop at all.</p>
            <p>This beeing the ſtate of the cauſe, and the Biſhops requiring remedie, ſome that were more vehement, returned to the things ſpoken in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, that were before the other Seſſion, againſt the exemption of Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars. But the wiſer ſort thinking it impoſſible to obtaine any thing, ſo long as the number and greatneſſe of the Regular Orders continued, and fauour of the Court, they were contented to remooue onely the exemptions of the Chapters; and particular perſons, and demande a reuocation of them all. But the Legates, treating with them in particular, and putting then in mind that all the reformation could not bee made by that Seſſion, that it was fit to begin, and leaue ſomething for future times, made them reſt contented, that the exemption of particular Prieſts, Friars, not inhabiting in the Cloyſters, <note place="margin">A ſmal refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption is made.</note> and of Chapters, only in criminall cauſes, ſhould be remooued (from whence the greater diſorders doe ariſe,) as alſo faculties to giue Clericall Orders to him that reſideth not in his owne dioceſſe: promiſing to prouide againſt the other abuſes in another Seſſion.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were handled in <hi>Trent,</hi> the Pope hauing receiued ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice <note place="margin">Card <hi>Farneſe</hi> the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate with the Emperour, is recalled.</note> from the Cardinall <hi>Farneſe,</hi> conſidering with how ſmall reputation an Apoſtolique Legate did remaine in <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> when his ſouldiers were in the field, he recalled him: and, with him, a great number of Italian Gentlemen, which were of the Popes troupes, did depart.

Germanie</hi> at the Emperours diſcretion; and this was the cauſe why many Princes and Cities combined, did incline to compoſition with him, hauing honeſt caution to hold their religion. But he would not make mention ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in writing, leſt the warre ſhould ſeeme to bee made for that cauſe, which would offend thoſe that followed him, make others more vnwilling to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelues, and giue ſuſpicion to the Eccleſiaſtiques of <hi>Germanie,</hi> who hoped to ſee the Romane Rites reſtored in euery place. Yet his Miniſters promiſed them all, that they ſhould not bee moleſted in the exerciſe of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, excuſing their Maſter, if, for many reſpects, he could not ſatisfie them, to make a capitulation thereof: and hee ſo caried himſelfe, that his reſolution appeared to giue them content, by conniuencie; By theſe deditions the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour gained much artilery, drew much money from the Cities, to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of many hundred thouſands, and, which was of greateſt importance, was abſolute Lord of all <hi>High Germanie.</hi>

The reſidue, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of December, the Emperours Armie being lodged neere the Village of <hi>Sothen,</hi> departed, by order from the Pope, from whom <hi>Octauius</hi> had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to returne into <hi>Italy,</hi> and to tell his Vncle, that the ſixe moneths bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, the Pope could no longer beare ſo great a charge: that the time of the obligation was ended, and that effected for which the league was made, that is, <hi>Germany</hi> brought into obedience. The Emperour complayned, that <note place="margin">Whereof the Emperour complaineth.</note> he was abandoned when he had moſt need of helpe. For nothing was done, ſo long as the Heads were not oppreſſed, who could not bee ſaid to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, but retired onely, to defend their owne Territories; and being deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from feare, it was to bee doubted they would returne with greater forces, and better order then before. But the Pope iuſtified his not continuing in the <note place="margin">The Pope iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth his action.</note> league, and the departure of his men, by ſaying, that hee was not made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the compoſition with the Cities and Princes, which could not be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed without him; and eſpecially, becauſe it was made with much preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Catholique faith, tolerating hereſie, which might haue been roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out. That according to capitulation, hee had not been partaker of the profits of the warre, nor of the money the Countreys paid which did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound; that the Emperour complained, when himſelfe was offended and diſeſteemed, euen with dammage of religion. Nor content with this, hee forbade the Emperour to receiue money of the Churches of <hi>Spaine,</hi> longer then the ſixe moneths: and though the Emperours Miniſters made many ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall treaties with him, ſhewing that the cauſe continuing, for which they were granted, it required that the grant alſo ſhould continue, and that all would be in vaine, and without fruit, if the warre were not ended, yet they <note place="margin">The <hi>Fieſehi</hi> make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie againſt the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:17208:121"/>
was author of it, and beleeued that it came from the Pope, and refrained not <note place="margin">1547 PAVL 3. CHARLES 5. HENRY 8. FRANCIS 1.</note> to adde this complaint to the others. The Pope beleeued the Emperour would be buſied in <hi>Germanie</hi> a long time, and not be able to offend him with temporall forces: but feared he might trouble him by making the Proteſtants goe to the Councell. To ſeparate the Councell ſeemed too violent and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous a remedy, eſpecially hauing continued ſeuen moneths in a treatie, whereof nothing was publiſhed. He was of opinion to publiſh the things already digeſted, ſeeing that by that declaration, either the Proteſtants would <note place="margin">The Popes reſolution concerning the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> refuſe to goe thither, or, if they went, would be conſtrained to accept it; wherein the principall point of all the controuerſies conſiſting, the victory would be his owne. And if there were no other reaſon to doe it, this was ſufficient to prooue it was good for him, becauſe the Emperour would not haue any controuerſies decided. For the counſels of thoſe that haue contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ends, ought to be contrary. Hee ſaw well, that the Emperour would not take it for an affront. But the diſtaſtes betweene them were already ſo great, that little could be added to them; and the Pope, when hee was preſſed with reaſons, which did perſwade and diſſwade, was wont to vſe the Florentine ſaying, A thing done hath an head; and ſo to execute that which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Therefore he wrote to the Legates in Chriſtmas, that they ſhould hold a Seſſion, and publiſh the decrees already framed. This commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being receiued, they called a Congregation the third of Ianuary, in <note place="margin">1547</note> which hauing determined, by the vniforme conſent of all, to imitate a Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the thirteenth, in regard it was tedious to all, to remaine there ſo long, and reſolue of nothing; the Legates did propoſe the publication of the Decrees framed. For thoſe of faith, the Emperours Prelates oppoſed, and ſaid, that there was no opportunity as yet, and that it ſufficed to publiſh the reformation. But the <hi>Papalins</hi> vrged the contrary; alledging it was knowen to all the world, that the point of grace and iuſtification had been diſcuſſed ſeuen moneths together, and that the Decree was eſtabliſhed; and that it would be a derogation to the faith, if the Councell ſhould ſeeme to feare the publiſhing of the trueth, which was decided. And becauſe theſe were more in number, their opinion, aſſiſted by the Legates, preuailed. The two next Congregations were ſpent, in reading againe the Decrees, as well of faith as <note place="margin">The Seſſion is held the 13 of Ianuary, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of faith and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</note> reformation: the which, ſome ſmall matters beeing corrected, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of thoſe who were not preſent at the firſt, pleaſed them all. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, accompanied with the Prelates, went to the Church with the vſuall ceremonies, on Thurſday the thirteenth of Ianuary, and held the Seſſion; where <hi>Andreas Cornarus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> ſang Maſſe, <hi>Thomas Stella;</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salpi,</hi> did preach; and the Decrees of faith and reformation were read.</p>
            <p>The firſt conteined ſixteene heads, with their prohemes, and thirty three <hi>anathematiſmes.</hi> After it had forbid to beleeue, preach, or teach, otherwiſe then was conſtituted and expreſſed in that Decree, it declared in ſubſtance: 1. That neither Gentiles, by naturall meanes, nor Iewes, by the letter of <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> hath been able to free themſelues from ſinne. 2. Whereupon GOD ſent his Sonne, to redeeme the one and the other. 3. Who, though he died for all, yet thoſe onely enioy the benefit, vnto whom his merit is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17208:122"/>
4. That the iuſtification of the wicked, is nothing but a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the ſtate of the ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> into the ſtate of the adopted ſonne of God, by IESV CHRIST, which, after the publication of the Goſpel, is not done without Baptiſme, or the vow thereof. 5. That the beginning of iuſtification, in men of age, proceedeth from preuenting grace, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiteth to diſpoſe themſelues, conſenting, and cooperating with it freely: which they doe willingly and might refuſe. 6. The manner of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, is firſt to beleeue, willingly, the diuine reuelations, and promiſes, and knowing ones ſelfe to bee a ſinner, to turne from the feare of Gods Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to his mercie, to hope for pardon from him, and therefore to begin to loue him, and hate ſinne: and finally, purpoſing to bee baptized, to begin a new life, and keepe the commandements of God. 7. That iuſtification followeth this preparation, which is not onely a remiſſion of ſinnes, but ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification alſo; and hath 5. cauſes: the finall, the glory of God, and eternall life: the efficient, God: the meritory, CHRIST: the inſtrumentall, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: and the formall, iuſtice, giuen by God, receiued according to the good pleaſure of the holy Ghoſt, and according to the diſpoſition of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer, receiuing, together with remiſſion of ſinnes, faith, hope, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. 8. That when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that man is iuſtified by faith, and <hi>gratis,</hi> it ought to be vnderſtood, becauſe faith is the beginning, and the things that precede iuſtification are not meritorious of grace. 9. That ſinnes are not pardoned to him that vaunteth, and repoſeth himſelfe onely in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and certainty of the remiſſion. Neither ought it to be ſaid, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith doth iuſtifie, but euery one as hee ſhould not doubt of the mercie of God, the merits of CHRIST, and efficacie of the Sacraments, ſo, in regard of his owne indiſpoſition he may doubt, becauſe he cannot know by certainty of infallible faith, that he hath obtained grace. 10. That the iuſt are more iuſtified by obſeruing the Commandements of God and the Church. 11. That it cannot be ſaid, that the Commandements of God are impoſſible to the iuſt, who, though he fall into veniall ſinnes, yet ceaſeth not to be ſo; that no man ought to relie on faith onely, nor ſay, that the iuſt ſinneth in euery good action, or committeth ſinne, if he do any thing for reward. 12. That no man ſhould preſume hee is predeſtinated, beleeuing that the iuſtified can ſinne no more, or ſinning, can promiſe himſelfe repentance. 13. That no man can promiſe to himſelfe abſolute certaintie to perſeuere vntill the end, but ſhould put his hope in the aſſiſtance of God, who will continue, if man faile not. 14. That thoſe that are fallen into ſinne may againe receiue grace, beeing ſtirred vp from aboue to recouer it by repentance, which differeth from <hi>baptiſme,</hi> becauſe it containeth not only contrition, but ſacramental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, Prieſtly abſolution, at the leaſt in vow, and ſatisfaction beſides for the temporall puniſhment, which is not alwayes remitted altogether, as in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. 15. That the grace of God is loſt, not onely by infidelity, but by any mortall ſinne, though faith bee not loſt by it. 16. It propoſeth to the iuſt the exerciſe of good workes, by which eternall life is gained, as grace promiſed by the mercie of God, and a reward due to good workes by the diuine promiſe. And it concludeth that this doctrine doth not eſtabliſh any iuſtice of our owne, refuſing the iuſtice of God, but the ſame is ſaid to bee

ours, becauſe it is in vs, and of GOD, being infuſed by him for the merit of CHRIST. In fine, to make euery one vnderſtand, not only the doctrine to be followed, but that alſo which is to be auoided, it addeth Canons, againſt him that ſaith. 1. That a man may bee iuſtified without grace, by the ſtrength of humane nature, and doctrine of the Law. 2. That grace is giuen to liue well with greater facilitie, and to merit eternall life, as if free <note place="margin">The Canons</note> will can doe it, but with difficultie. 3. That a man may beleeue, loue, hope or repent, as he ought, without the preuention, or aſſiſtance of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. 4. That free will, excited by GOD, doeth not cooperate, to diſpoſe vs to grace, nor can diſſent, though it would. 5. That after the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> free will is loſt. 6. That it is not in the power of man to doe ill, but as well bad as good workes, are done, not onely by Gods permiſſion, but by his owne proper working. 7 That all workes, done before iuſtification, are ſinnes, and that a man ſinneth the more, by how much the more hee labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to diſpoſe himſelfe vnto grace. 8. That the feare of hell, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs abſtaine from ſin, and to flie to the mercy of GOD, is ſin. 9. That the wicked is iuſtified by faith onely, without preparation, proceeding from the motion of his will. 10. That man is iuſtified without the iuſtice by which CHRIST did merit for vs, or is formally iuſt by that. 11. That he is iuſtified onely by the imputation of the iuſtice of CHRIST, or onely by remiſſion of ſinnes without inherent grace and charitie; or that the grace of iuſtification is onely the fauour of GOD. 12. That iuſtifying faith is nothing but confidence in the mercy of GOD, who remitteth ſinnes for CHRIST. 13. That, for remiſſion of ſinnes, it is neceſſary to beleeue they are remitted not doubting of ones own indiſpoſition. 14. That man is abſolued and iuſtified, becauſe he doeth firmely beleeue it. 15. That he is bound by faith to beleeue that hee is in the number of the predeſtinated. 16. That one may be certaine he hath the gift of perſeuerance, without ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reuelation. 17. That onely that the predeſtinated obtaine grace. 18. That the Commandements of God are impoſſible to the iuſt. 19. That there is no other Euangelicall precept but of faith. 20. That the iuſt and perfect man is not bound to obſerue the Commandements of God and the Church, or that the Goſpel is a promiſe without condition of obſeruing the Commandements. 21. That CHRIST is giuen for a redeemer, not for a law-maker. 22. That the iuſtified may perſeuere without the ſpeciall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of GOD, or cannot with it. 23. That the iuſt cannot ſinne, or can auoyde all veniall ſinnes, without a ſpeciall priuiledge, as the Church holdeth of the Virgin. 24. That iuſtice is not preſerued and increaſed by good workes, but that they are fruits onely or ſignes. 25. That the iuſt ſinneth mortally, or venially, in euery worke. 26. That the iuſt ought not to expect a reward for his good workes. 27 That there is no mortall ſinne but infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. 28 That grace being loſt, faith is loſt alſo; or that the faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning is not true nor of a Chriſtian. 29 That man ſinning after bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, cannot be lifted vp by the grace of God, or may recouer it by faith onely, without the Sacrament of penanace. 30. That euery fault and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is wholly remitted to euery penitent man, there remaning no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhment, to bee indured in this life, or in Purgatorie. 31. That
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17208:123"/>
the iuſt ſinneth, if hee doe good, onely in hope of an eternall reward. 32. That the good workes of the iuſt, are the gifts of God, and are not withall the merits of the iuſtified. 33. That this doctrine is derogatory to the glory of God, and merits of CHRIST, or that their glory is not made more illuſtrious by it.</p>
            <p>When I had made this ſhort narration of the Decree, I began to thinke it ſuperfluous, ſeeing all the decrees of that Councel are printed in one volume, <note place="margin">The authors reaſon why he rehearſeth the decrees though they be printed in a volume apart.</note> and in euery mans hands, and that in the compoſition of the Actes that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, I might referre my ſelfe to that booke: and I was about to teare this leafe. But conſidering that ſome might deſire to reade the whole continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in one booke only, and that if any thought it better to ſee the originall, hee might omit this mine abbreuiation, I reſolued not to change, but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ſame ſtile in the matters following: and the rather, becauſe I am grieued, when, in <hi>Zenophon</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi> I ſee the narration of things, moſt knowen to their times, omitted, which remaineth vnknowen to mee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no meanes to know it againe: and I hold it for a maxime, that one ought neuer to referre himſelfe to another. Therefore I come to the ſumme of the Decree of reformation.</p>
            <p>Which did containe in ſubſtance; 1. That the Synod being willing to <note place="margin">The Decree of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> amend the depraued manners of the Clergie and people, thought fit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the gouernours of the greater Churches. Therefore truſting in God, and his Vicar on earth, that, that charge ſhall be giuen to worthy men, exerciſed from their youth in Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, it doth admoniſh them to performe their duety, which cannot bee executed without reſiding in the place, where it is to bee done: Yet many, leauing the flocke, and care of the lambes, wander in Courts, and apply themſelues to ſecular buſineſſe. Therefore the Synod doth reuiue all the ancient Canons againſt non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and doth conſtitute beſides, that euery gouernour of a Cathedrall Church, of what title or preeminencie ſoeuer, who ſhall remaine ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths together out of his Dioceſſe, without a iuſt and reaſonable cauſe, ſhall loſe the fourth part of the reuenues, and if he perſeuere ſixe moneths more, ſhall loſe another fourth part, and the contumacie increaſing, the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litane, vpon paine of not entring into the Church for three moneths, ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late him to the Pope, who, by his ſupreame authoritie, may inflict greater puniſhment, or prouide the Church of a more profitable Paſtor. And if the Metropolitan ſhall likewiſe offend, the moſt ancient Suffragan ſhall bee bound to denounce him.</p>
            <p>2. But others, inferiours to Biſhops, tyed to reſidence either by law or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, ſhall be compelled thereunto by the Biſhops, abrogating euery pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge which giueth a perpetuall exemption from reſiding. But diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions granted for a time, for a reaſonable cauſe, true, and prooued before the Ordinary, ſhall remaine in force, and the Biſhop, as Delegate of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike Sea, ſhall take care that a ſufficient Vicar bee prouided for the charge of ſoules, with a conuenient portion of the reuenues, notwithſtanding any priuiledge or exemption.</p>
            <p>3. Beſide that no Clerke, by perſonall priuiledge, or regular dwelling out of the Monaſterie, by priuiledge of his order, ſhall bee exempt from
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17208:123"/>
beeing puniſhed, if hee offend, or viſited, or corrected by his Ordinary.</p>
            <p>4. Likewiſe that Chapters of Cathedrall and other Collegiate Churches, ſhall not, by vertue of exemption, cuſtomes, oathes, and agreements, bee freed from the viſitation of their Biſhops, and greater Prelates, when there ſhall be neede.</p>
            <p>5. In fine, it did ordaine that no Biſhop might exerciſe Pontificall actes in the dioceſſe of another, by pretence of priuiledge, without his leaue, and <note place="margin">The next Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to bee held the third of March.</note> onely ouer his ſubiects. And the day of the next Seſſion was appointed the third of March.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Rome,</hi> the Decree of faith miniſtred no matter of diſcourſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it was not new, as well becauſe it had beene ſeene, and examined pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely (as hath beene ſayd) as becauſe all men knew that the Germane opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were to bee condemned. But the Court Biſhops, who had beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid a long time of the Article of reſidencie, which was handled, did reſt content, aſſuring themſelues that the Decree of the Councell, could worke no greater effect, then the Popes Decretals had done before. But the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <note place="margin">The inferiour Courtiers are diſcontented with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> Courtiers were diſcontented, ſeeing the Biſhop had power to compell them. They lamented their owne miſery, who were to ſerue all their life to gaine their liuing, and after ſo much paines taken, for a reward, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in a village, or, by a baſe Canonry, ſubiected to a greater ſlauery, in obeying the Biſhops, who will not onely keepe them, as it were, tied to a ſtake, but with viſitations, and pretence of corrections, will bring them to a miſerable ſubiection, or hold them in perpetuall vexations, and charge.</p>
            <p>But elſewhere, and eſpecially in <hi>Germanie,</hi> when the Decrees were ſeene, <note place="margin">The Decrees are cenſured in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </note> that of faith was more ſpoken of: which muſt bee read ouer and againe, with much attention and ſpeculation, becauſe it could not bee vnderſtood without a perfect knowledge of the inward motion of the mind, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing in whom it is actiue, in whom paſſiue, things moſt ſubtile, and, for the diuers appearance they make, euer accounted diſputable; all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Councel turning vpon this hinge, whether the firſt obiect of the will worke vpon the will, or the will vpon the obiect, or whether they bee both actiue and paſſiue. Some pleaſant wits ſaid, that if the Aſtrologers, not knowing the true cauſes of the celeſtiall motions, to ſalue the appearances, haue inuented <hi>Eccentriques,</hi> and <hi>Epicicles,</hi> it was no wonder if the Councell, deſiring to ſalue the appearances of the ſuper-celeſtiall motions, did fall into <hi>excentricitie</hi> of opinions. The Grammarians did not ceaſe to admire and ſcoffe the artifice of that propoſition, which is in the fifth Chapter; <hi>Neque homo ipſe nihil omnino agat;</hi> which they ſayd was not intelligible; and without exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For if the Synode would ſignifie: <hi>Etiam homo ipſe aliquid agat;</hi> it might ſay ſo plainely, as is fit to doe in matter of faith, where the more ſimple ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is the better; and if they would vſe an elegancie, they might ſay, <hi>Etiam homo ipſe nihil agat.</hi> But the word <hi>(omnino)</hi> beeing interpoſed, that ſpeech is incongruous and without ſence, as all are which haue two nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues that cannot be reſolued into an affirmatiue. For to reſolue that, one muſt ſay, <hi>Etiam homo ipſe aliquid omnino agat,</hi> which is incongruous, and not to bee vnderſtood, what <hi>aliquid omnino</hi> may ſignifie heere. For it would ſay
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17208:124"/>
that a man hath an action in a certaine kinde, which in another kinde is no action.</p>
            <p>The Fathers were defended, by ſaying, that to examine the forme of Speech ſo ſeuerely, was nothing but to cauill. Whereunto they replyed, that a gentle interpretation was due vnto vſuall formes of ſpeach, but that it is a publique vtility to diſcouer the artifice of him, that, leauing the cleere and vſuall phraſes, inuenteth thoſe that are incongruous, and containe in them contradiction, to cauill, and to play on both ſides.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that vnderſtood Theologie ſaid, that the doctrine, that a man may alwayes refuſe diuine inſpirations, was contrary to the publike, and ancient prayer of the Church. <hi>Et ad te nostras etiam rebelles compelle propitius Uolunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi> Which is not fit wee ſhould ſay is a vaine deſire, but that it is made by faith, as S. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, and granted by God to his elected. They added that one could no more ſay with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that it commeth not from man which doth ſeparate the veſſell of wrath from thoſe of Gods mercie, that which ſeparateth being that humane, <hi>Non nihil omnino.</hi> Many did conſider that place of the ſeuenth Chapter, where it is ſayd, Iuſtice is giuen by meaſure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good pleaſure of God, and the diſpoſition of the receiuer; both which things cannot bee true. For if it pleaſed God to giue more to him that were leſſe diſpoſed, it would not bee by meaſure of the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and if it bee by the meaſure of that, there is alwayes the motiue by which God worketh, and doeth not vſe his good pleaſure. They maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that thoſe were condemned, who ſayd that the Precepts of God were impoſſible to bee kept; ſeeing that the ſame Councell, in the Decree of the ſecond Seſſion, exhorteth the faithfull aſſembled in <hi>Trent,</hi> that, repenting, confeſſing, and communicating, they ſhould obſerue the Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, <hi>Quantum quiſquis poterit.</hi> Which modification would bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, if the iuſtified could keepe them abſolutely; and they noted that the ſame word, <hi>Praecepta,</hi> was there, to take away all cauill.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that were read in the Eccleſiaſticall Story, ſayd, that in all the Councels, held in the Church, from the Apoſtles time vntill now, there were neuer ſo many Articles decided, as in this Seſſion onely; in which <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> had a great part, by hauing exactly diſtinguiſhed all the kindes of cauſes, which if hee had not done, wee had wanted many Articles of Faith.</p>
            <p>The Polititians alſo, though they ought not to examinematters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but ſimply follow them, yet found matter of diſcourſe in this Decree. For ſeeing in the tenth Chapter, the Obligation of obeying the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of GOD and the Church, and the ſame replied in the twentieth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, they were ſcandalized, becauſe there was no mention of Obligation to the commandements of Princes and Magiſtrates. They ſaid that obedience vnto theſe is more plainely ſet downe in the Scripture; that the old Law is full of it; that the doctrine is cleere in the new Teſtament, expreſſed, and handled at large by CHRIST himſelfe, by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> That there is found an expreſſe Obligation to heare the Church, but none expreſſe to obey it. Hee is obeyed who commandeth of his owne power, and hee is heard who doeth promulgate that which belongeth to another man. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:17208:124"/>
were theſe men ſatisfied with the excuſe, that the commandements of Princes are included in thoſe of God, and that obedience is due vnto them, becauſe God hath commanded they ſhould bee obeyed. But they replyed that, by this reaſon, the Church rather ought to bee omitted; and ſaid that the Church was expreſſed, and the Princes paſſed ouer in ſilence, to breede (according to the ancient ſcope of the Eccleſiaſtiques) that pernicious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that men are bound to obey them for conſcience ſake, and Princes and Magiſtrates onely for feare of temporall puniſhments, and that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their commandements may be tranſgreſſed without reſpect, and ſo to cauſe euery gouernment to be hated, accounted tyrannicall, and ſubuerted, and, by deſcribing the ſubiection vnto Prieſts to be the only principall way to gaine heauen, to draw all iuriſdiction to themſelues, and by conſequence, all authority.</p>
            <p>The Decree of reformation was ſaid to bee a meere illuſion. For to truſt in God and the Pope that prouiſion ſhould bee made of perſons worthy to gouerne the Churches, belongeth rather to him that prayeth, then to him that reformeth. To renew the ancient Canons with one word onely, and one ſo generall, was more to confirme the diſuſe of them: but if they would reſtore them in earneſt, they ſhould remooue the cauſes which haue buried them in ſilence, giue them ſtrength by penalties, and deputation of thoſe that ſhould put them in execution, and ſhould vſe other meanes which doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue, and preſerue Lawes. In fine it was ſaid to haue done nothing but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh that one might bee abſent all the yeere, by looſing halfe the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, or rather one was taught how hee might not reſide eleuen moneths and more, without any puniſhment, by interpoſing thoſe thirty dayes or fewer, in the midſt of the other time of the yeere; and that the Decree was wholly deſtroyed, with the exception of iuſt and reaſonable cauſes, which no man is ſo ſimple as not to find, being to haue Iudges for whom it will be profitable not to haue reſidencie practiſed.</p>
            <p>This place requireth that mention ſhould bee made of a particular acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, which, then begun, though it ended not vntill after foure moneths, belongeth wholly to the preſent Seſſion, &amp; maketh knowen what the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was, and in what eſtimation it was had, by thoſe that aſſiſted in it. For the vnderſtanding whereof, I will repeat that Friar <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> who had (as hath been ſayd) a great part in the Synod, in framing the Decrees of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, and iuſtification, hauing noted all the opinions and reaſons vſed in <note place="margin">

Comming to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the certainety of grace, hee ſaid in a long diſcourſe; that the Synode had declared, that a man cannot know hee hath grace by ſo great certain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>e, as is that of faith, excluding all doubt. <hi>Catarinus,</hi> newly made Biſhop of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nori,</hi> hauing defended the contrary, and ſtill perſeuering, did print a little booke, with an Epiſtle Dedicatory to the ſame Synode; the ſcope whereof was, to maintaine that the Councels meaning was not to condemne the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:17208:125"/>
opinion of him that ſaith a iuſt man may know hee hath grace, as certainly as hee knoweth the Articles of Faith to bee true: yea, that the Councell hath decided that hee is bound to beleeue it, becauſe, in the ſixe and twentieth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, it hath condemned him that ſaith that the iuſt man ought not to hope for, and expect a reward, it being neceſſary, that hee that ought to hope as a iuſt man ſhould know hee is ſo. In this contrariety of opinions, both wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting affirmatiuely to the Councell, either of them did not onely ſay, that his opinion was the opinion of the Synode, but afterwards wrote alſo and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Apologies, and Antipologies, making complaints to the Synode the one of the other, of attributing that to it, which it neuer ſaid, bringing diuers teſtimonies of the Fathers to proue their owne opinion: who bare witneſſe; ſome for one, ſome for another; ſo that the Fathers were all diuided into two parts, except ſome good Prelates, who as neutrals, ſaid, that they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not the difference, but gaue conſent to the Decree, in the forme as it was publiſhed, becauſe both the parties were agreed. The Legate <hi>Santa Croce</hi> did teſtifie for <hi>Catarinus. Monte</hi> ſaid, hee was of a third party. This ſeemed to put all men out of hope to vnderſtand the meaning of the Councel, ſeeing the principall men that were preſent in it, did not agree. And it doth raiſe a difficulty, what that Synode was that determined the Article, vnto which, <hi>Soto</hi> and <hi>Catarinus</hi> did write and appeale, each thinking it was on his ſide; ſo that it was neceſſary, that either one of them, or both ſhould bee deceiued And what ſhall one thinke of the others, when it ſo happened to theſe? It might bee ſayd, it was the aggregate of all together, vnto which the holy Ghoſt giuing aſſiſtance, made it to determine the Trueth, though not vnderſtood by him that did determine it, as <hi>Cataphas</hi> did propheſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was high Prieſt, not vnderſtanding the propheſie, as the Biſhop of <hi>Bitonco</hi> ſaid in his Sermon. But this anſwere had two oppoſitions, the one, that God made the reprobate and infidels propheſie, without vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but the faithfull, by illuminating their minde; the other, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines doe vniformely ſay, that Councels doe not deliberate of faith by diuine inſpiration, but by humane diſquiſition, which the Spirit doth aſſiſt, to keepe them from errors, ſo that they cannot determine, without vnderſtanding the <note place="margin">Councels doe deliberate of faith, not by diuine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by humane diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition.</note> matter. Perhaps he ſhould hit vpon the trueth, that ſhould ſay, that, debating the contrary opinions in framing the Decree, euery party did refuſe wordes contrary to his opinion and all reſted in thoſe which he thought might be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his owne meaning: ſo that the expreſſion of the matter became capea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diuers interpretations. But this would not ſerue to reſolue the doubt propoſed, and to find what the Counſell was: becauſe it is to giue it vnity of words, and contrariety of meanings. But that which hath been related in this <note place="margin">All agreed in condemning the Lutheran opinions.</note> particular, and perhaps did happen in many matters, occurred not in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lutheran opinions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

But to returne to the Councell, the day after the Seſſion a generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was aſſembled, to deliberate of, and put in order the matter to be digeſted in the next Seſſion, and, for matter of faith, it being already deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to follow the confeſſion of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> the firſt point was of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall miniſtery, which the Lutherans ſay is authoritie to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and to adminiſter the Sacraments; and ſome reſting vpon the firſt part, did propoſe that the Eccleſiaſticall authoritie ſhould bee handled, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all thoſe functions, ſpirituall and temporall, which God hath giuen them ouer the faithfull, and are denied by the Lutherans. And this did generally pleaſe the Prelates, becauſe it was a matter of an eaſie vnderſtanding, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any crabbedneſſe of the Schoole, and where themſelues might haue a part. But it was not gratefull to the Diuines, becauſe thoſe things were not handled in the Schooles; ſo that they ſhould haue nothing to diſpute, and muſt referre themſelues for the moſt part to the Canoniſts. They ſaid that the Auguſtanes doe not handle all Eccleſiaſticall authoritie, but that onely of preaching; whereof there was as much decreed in the laſt Seſſion as was ſufficient; but in the ſecond part there was matter that did cohere with iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, <note place="margin">The ſubiect of the next Seſſion is the Sacraments. The Legates deſire to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Councell and Pope.</note> that is, the Sacraments, which are the meanes to be iuſtified, and ſaid it was more fit to make theſe the ſubiect of the next Seſſion. The Legats, and their dependants adhered hereunto, in ſhew for the ſame reaſons, but indeede for another more potent, becauſe, in the other conſideration, they might haue handled the authoritie of Councels, and of the Pope, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many hard matters, not fit to bee mooued.</p>
            <p>Hauing reſolued to handle the matter of the Sacraments, it was conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that it was various and ample, not poſſible to bee comprehended in a Seſſion, nor eaſie to bee determined into how many parts it ought to bee diuided. The Auguſtans made it ſhort by taking away foure Sacraments, of which they ought to treate more exactly, to reeſtabliſh them: therefore that it was good to begin to diſcuſſe the Sacraments in generall, &amp; charge was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to put in order the Articles drawen out of the Lutheran doctrine, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alſo to the Sacraments in particular, of as many as ſeemed eaſie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe: and that the reformation might follow the definition of faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the abuſes, occurring in the miniſter of the Sacraments, ſhould be put together, ordaining a Congregation of Prelates and Canoniſts to diſcourſe of the remedies, and to frame the Decrees, with order, that if they both hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on the ſame day, <hi>Santa Croce</hi> ſhould bee Preſident of the Theologues, and <hi>Monte</hi> of the Canoniſts, and both together in the generall Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But beſide this, in regard of the promiſe to continue the matter of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, ſome of the moſt principall Articles thereof were to bee handled. In this it was not ſo eaſie to agree, becauſe the Legates and their adherents had contrary ends to the other Biſhops.</p>
            <p>Theſe began to hope, and to ayme, almoſt all, but eſpecially the Spaniards, <note place="margin">The Spaniſh Prelates hope to regaine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</note> to regaine the Epiſcopall authoritie, which anciently euery one did exerciſe in his owne Dioceſſe, when the reſeruations of Benefices, of Caſes, or of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, Diſpenſations, and the like were vnknowen, which they were wont to ſay in priuate diſcourſe, when few were preſent, that ambition and auarice had made proper to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder a fained colour to
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:17208:126"/>
mannage them better, and more to the publike ſeruice of God, and the Church, throughout all Chriſtendome, then the Biſhops could doe in their owne Cities, in regard of their imperfection and ignorance. But it was not ſo, becauſe diſſolution and ignorance did not enter into the Epiſcopal order, vntill they were compelled to goe as ſeruants to <hi>Rome.</hi> But if bad gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were then ſeene in the Biſhops, which cauſed their authority to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">Card. <hi>Monte</hi> doth cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diuert the deciſion of reſidence.</note> away, now it may bee ſeene to bee worſt of all in the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that, by the ſame reaſon, that mannagement ought to bee taken away which is not proper to it, but much abuſed by it.</p>
            <p>The decree, that reſidencie was required by the Law of God, was eſteemed by theſe Prelats the beſt remedie for the diſeaſe paſt, and preſeruatiue againſt hereafter. For if God hath commanded Biſhops to reſide perpetually with the flocke, it followeth neceſſarily that hee hath alſo preſcribed them the charge, and giuen them power to exerciſe it well. Therefore the Pope cannot call them, or buſie them in ought elſe, nor diſpence with them, nor reſtraine their authoritie, giuen them by God. Therefore they deſired to proceede to the determination, ſaying, it was neceſſary to reſolue the Article, becauſe it was ſufficiently diſcuſſed. The Cardinall of <hi>Monte</hi> hauing premeditated before, let them ſpeake who were moſt earneſt, that part of the heate might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale; then he oppoſed himſelfe dexterouſly, and ſaid, it was neceſſary to doe it, becauſe the world did expect it, but that they ought to doe it in a fit time; that the difficultie was handled with too much heate, and that in ſome it had ſtirred more paſſion then reaſon; ſo that it was neceſſary to let the feruor bee cooled, and to interpoſe a little time, that, the contentions being forgotten, and charitie reuiued, place may bee giuen to the holy Ghoſt, without which the trueth cannot be decided. That the Popes Holineſſe, who hath vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to his griefe, the former contentions, deſireth the ſame, that himſelfe alſo may diſcuſſe the matter in <hi>Rome,</hi> and aſſiſt the Synod with his counſell. He concluded, with more reſolute termes, then ſo modeſt a beginning ought to inferre; that no more ſpeach ſhould bee had of it before the Seſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Popes will was reſolutely ſo, but that they ſhould attend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the inconueniences which haue cauſed the abuſe of not reſiding. This mixture of remonſtrances and power made ſome of the Fathers, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards did print treaties concerning this matter, ſay, and put in print, that the Legates did forbid to ſpeake of this queſtion; and others denied it, with an inuectiue againſt the firſt, ſaying, they derogated from the libertie of the Councell. In the end of the Congregation it was reſolued to reſume the things that remained to bee diſcuſſed in the laſt Seſſion, and to treate of remoouing the impediments, which are the cauſes of not reſiding. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which the moſt principall beeing pluralitie of Benefices, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it was impoſſible to reſide in many places, it was reſolued to treate of that.</p>
            <p>But to auoid confuſion, I will relate withall that which belongeth to the Sacraments, where the conſideration, for the moſt part, was ſpeculatiue and doctrinall, not to interrupt the order of the matter of Benefices, wherein ſome things hapned which did open a way to important and dangerous actions. Articles were framed by the deputies in matter of the Sacraments, and the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:17208:126"/>
manner of ſpeaking of them was preſcribed to the Diuines, communicated to all in a ſheete of paper, with order that they ſhould ſay, whether they were all hereticall or erroneous, and ought to be condemned by the Synode; and if any deſerued not that ſentence, they ſhould alleadge their reaſons and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and after ſhould declare what was the opinion of Councels, and of the holy Fathers, in all thoſe, and which of the Articles haue beene reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued already, and which remaine to bee condemned: and if in this matter any one ſhould finde out ſome other Article worthy of cenſure, hee ſhould giue notice thereof, and auoyde impertinent queſtions in all, wherein one might diſpute on both ſides, without preiudice of faith, and all other ſuperfluity and tediouſneſſe of words.</p>
            <p>Of the Sacraments in generall there were foureteene Articles, 1. That <note place="margin">Fourteene Articles of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in generall.</note> the Sacraments of the Church are not ſeuen but fewer, which may bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led truely Sacraments. 2. That the Sacraments are not neceſſary, and that men may obtaine the grace of God without them, by faith onely. 3. No Sacrament is more worthy then another. 4. That the Sacraments of the new Law doe not giue grace vnto thoſe, who doe not reſiſt. 5. That the Sacraments haue neuer giuen grace or remiſſion of ſinnes, but onely the faith of the Sacrament. 6. That immediatly after the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Sacraments were inſtituted by God, by meanes whereof grace was giuen. 7. By the Sacraments, grace is giuen to him onely, who beleeueth that his ſinnes are remitted. 8. That grace is not giuen alwayes in the Sacraments, nor vnto all, in reſpect of the Sacrament it ſelfe, but onely when and where it pleaſeth God. 9. That in no Sacrament a <hi>Character</hi> is imprinted. 10. That a bad Miniſter doth not conferre the Sacrament. 11. That all Chriſtians of what ſexe ſoeuer, haue equall power in the miniſtery of the Word of God and Sacraments. 12. That euery Paſtour hath power to make long, or ſhort, or change at his pleaſure, the formes of the Sacraments. 13. That the intention of the Miniſters is not neceſſary, and worketh nothing in the Sacraments. 14. That the Sacraments haue beene inſtituted onely to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh faith.</p>
            <p>Of Baptiſme there were ſeuenteene Articles. 1. That in the Romane <note place="margin">Seuenteene Articles of Baptiſme.</note> Catholique Church, there is no true Baptiſme. 2. That Baptiſme is free, and not neceſſary to ſaluation. 3. That it is not true Baptiſme which is giuen by Heretiques. 4. That Baptiſme is repentance. 5. That Baptiſme is an externall ſigne, as the red marke in the Lambes, and hath no part in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. 6. That Baptiſme ought to be renued. 7. That true Baptiſme is faith, which beleeueth that ſinnes are remitted to the penitent. 8. That in Baptiſme ſinne is not rooted out, but onely not imputed. 9. That the Baptiſme of CHRIST and <hi>Iohn,</hi> haue the ſame vertue. 10. That the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of CHRIST hath not made voyd that of <hi>Iohn,</hi> but hath added the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe vnto it. 11. That in Baptiſme the immerſion onely is neceſſary, and all other things being free, may bee omitted without ſinne. 12. That it is better to omit the baptiſme of children, then baptize them while they doe not beleeue. 13. That children ought not to bee baptized, becauſe, they haue not proper faith. 14. That thoſe that are baptized in their childhood, comming to the age of diſcretion, ought to be rebaptized becauſe they haue
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:17208:127"/>
not beleeued. 15. That thoſe that haue beene baptized in their infancie, when they come to age, ought to be interrogated, whether they will ratifie that Baptiſme, and, if they deny, ought to be left in liberty. 16. That ſinnes committed after Baptiſme are remitted, onely by the memory and faith that one hath beene baptized. 17. That the vow of Baptiſme hath no other condition but of faith, yea, nullifieth all other conditions.</p>
            <p>Of Confirmation there were foure Articles. 1. That Confirmation is not a Sacrament. 2. That it is inſtituted by the Fathers, and hath no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <note place="margin">Foure Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</note> of the grace of God. 3. That now it is an idle ceremonie, and former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was a Catechiſme, when children, comming to age, gaue an account of their faith, before the Church. 4. That the Miniſter of Confirmation is not the Biſhop onely, but any Prieſt whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>In the Congregations, all the Diuines agreed, in affirming the number of ſeuen; and condemning the contrary opinion as hereticall, in regard of <note place="margin">All agree that there are ſeuen Sacraments, but not that there are no more. Reaſons to prooue the number of ſeuen.</note> the generall conſent of the Schooles, beginning from the Maſter of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, (who ſpake definitiuely thereof) vntill this time. To this they ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Decree of the Florentine Councell for the Armenians, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth that number, and; for greater confirmation, the vſe of the Romane Church was added; whence they concluded, that it ought to be held for an Apoſtolicall tradition, and article of Faith. But, for the ſecond part of the Article, all did not agree, ſome ſaying it was enough to follow the Florentine Councel, which paſſed no further. For to decide that the proper Sacraments are neither more nor fewer, doeth preſuppoſe a deciſion of the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eſſence, and a definition of the Sacrament; a thing difficult, in regard of the many definitions, brought not onely by the Schoole-men, but by the Fathers alſo, of which one will make that to bee a Sacrament, which another doth not. That it is a queſtion alſo amongſt the Schoole-men, whether the Sacrament can be defined, whether it haue vnitie, whether it bee reall, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionall: and that it is not reaſonable, in ſuch ambiguity, to tie concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with ſo ſtrong a bond. It was remembred, that Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> and Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> accounted the waſhing of feete a Sacrament, and that Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> made euery rite, by which GOD is honoured, to bee a Sacrament: and elſe-where vnderſtanding the word more ſtrictly then the propriety doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, maketh Sacraments onely thoſe, which are expreſſely mentioned in the New Teſtament; which are Baptiſme, and the Euchariſt onely, though hee doubteth in one place, that there is another.</p>
            <p>For the other part it was ſaid, that it was neceſſary to eſtabliſh for an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, that the proper Sacraments, are neither more nor leſſe, to repreſſe the boldneſſe as well of the <hi>Lutheranes,</hi> who make them ſometimes two, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three, ſometimes foure, as alſo of thoſe who exceede ſeuen; and if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a greater number, and ſometimes a leſſe, be found in the Fathers, it was becauſe then, before the determination of the Church; it was lawfull to vſe the word in a more large, or more ſtrict ſignification. And here, to eſtabliſh the ſufficiencie of this number of ſeuen, as the Schoole-men ſpeake, that is, that they are neither more nor leſſe, they were tedious in recounting the reaſons deduced from ſeuen naturall things, by which life is gained and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued; from the ſeuen vertues; from the ſeuen capitall vices; from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:17208:127"/>
defects, which came from originall ſin; from the ſixe dayes of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, and ſeuenth of reſt; from the ſeuen regions of <hi>Egypt;</hi> from the ſeuen Planets; from the famouſneſſe of the number of ſeuen, and other congruities, vſed by the principall Schoole-men, for proofe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; and many reaſons why the conſecration of Churches, of the veſſels of Biſhops, Abbats, Abbeſſes, and Monkes, are not Sacraments, nor holy water, nor the waſhing of feet, as Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayd, nor Martyrdome, nor the creation of Cardinals, nor the Coronation of the Pope.</p>
            <p>Some ſayde, that, to bridle the Heretiques, it was not ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Article, if euery one of the Sacraments were not particularly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for feare ſome bad ſpirit might exclude ſome of the true, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſome falſe. Afterwards, another eſſentiall point, for the Article, was called to minde, that is, to determine the Inſtitutor of all the Sacraments; which is CHRIST; to condemne the hereſie of the Lutherans, who aſcribe to CHRIST, the ordination of Baptiſme, and the Euchariſt only. And that CHRIST ought to be held, by faith, for the Inſtitutor, Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> and aboue all, the Apoſtolicall Tradition was alleadged: from which no man diſſented. But ſome ſayd, they ought not goe on ſo farre, and that it was enough, to keepe within the bounds of the Florentine Councell; and the rather, in regard that the Maſter of the Sentences held, that Extreame Vnction was inſtituted by Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> with <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> that Confirmation beganne after the Apoſtles. And the ſame <hi>Bonauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> with other Diuines, maketh the Apoſtles authors of the Sacrament of Penance. And many haue ſayd of Matrimony, that it was inſtituted by God in Paradiſe. And CHRIST himſelfe, when hee ſpake of it, in a place fit to name the authour, doth attribute the inſtitution thereof, not to himſelfe, but to the FATHER in the beginning. For theſe reſpects, they aduiſed not to adde that point, for feare of condemning the opininion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques. The Dominicanes on the contrary, did affirme, with ſome bitterneſſe of words, that thoſe Doctors might bee expounded and ſalued, with diuers diſtinctions, and that they would euer haue referred themſelues to the Church; but the Lutherane boldneſſe ought not to paſſe without condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, who haue brought in thoſe falſities, with contempt of the Church; and that was not to be tolerated in the raſh Lutherans, which might bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured in the holy Fathers.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond Article, of the neceſſitie of the Sacraments, ſome would <note place="margin">The neceſſi of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments.</note> not haue the condemnation to be abſolute, but a diſtinction made, in regard it is certaine, that all are not abſolutely neceſſarie. There was another opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo to be condemned, which ſaid, That the Sacraments were not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie in the Church, becauſe it is certaine, they are not neceſſary to euery one, yea, that ſome are incompatible, as Order, and Matrimonie. Yet the more common opinion was, that the Article ſhould bee condemned abſolutely, for two reaſons: one, becauſe the neceſſitie of one is ſufficient to make the Article falſe, as it lieth; the other, becauſe they are all neceſſary in ſome ſort ſome abſolutely, ſome by ſuppoſition, ſome by conueniencie, and ſome for greater vtilitie. But many maruailed, that Articles of Faith ſhould bee eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, in ſuch multiplicity of equiuocation. For whoſe ſatisfaction, when
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17208:128"/>
the Canons, were compoſed, there was added, condemning him that held the Sacraments not to be neceſſarie, but ſuperfluous; inlarging by this laſt terme the ſignification of the firſt.</p>
            <p>Many were of opinion that the other part of the Article ought to bee omitted, becauſe it was defined in the laſt Seſſion, that faith onely was not ſufficient: and <hi>Marinarus</hi> ſayd that the diſtinction of the Sacrament in vow, was vſed by the Schoolemen, but was vnknowen to antiquitie, and full of difficulties. For in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> when <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion was inſtructed, the Angel ſayd, his prayers were acceptable to God before hee knew the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and other particulars of Faith; and all his familie, hearing the Sermon of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> receiued the holy Ghoſt before they had been inſtructed in the Doctrine of the Sacraments: and after the holy Ghoſt receiued, they were inſtructed concerning Baptiſme, by Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> ſo that hauing no knowledge of it, they could not receiue it in vow; and the Thiefe vpon the Croſſe, then onely illuminated by the vertue of CHRIST, knew not the Sacraments, nor could make any vow of them. And many holy Martyrs, conuerted in the heate of perſecution, by ſeeing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of others, and preſently taken and put to death, one cannot ſay, but by diuination, that they knew the Sacraments and could make a vow. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was better to leaue that diſtinction to the Schooles, and to put it in the Articles of faith. The common opinion was to the contrarie, ſaying, that although the words of the diſtinction were new and ſcholaſticall, yet one muſt beleeue that the thing ſignified was taught by CHRIST, and is an Apoſtolicall tradition: and for the examples of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the Thiefe, and Martyrs, it is to bee vnderſtood, that there are two ſorts of vowes of the Sacrament; the one explicite, the other implicite; and, at the leaſt, this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is neceſſarie: that is, that they had not the vow actually, but would haue had it, if they had been informed. Theſe things the others granted to be true, but not obligatorie, as Articles of faith. The difficulties, in which they could not agree, where referred to the Synod, that is to the generall Congregation.</p>
            <p>As it hapned alſo in the third Article; which, though euery one thought to be falſe, yet all did agree, that, in regard of the neceſſitie and vtilitie, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme <note place="margin">Concerning the dignity of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> doth proceede; in regard of the ſignification, Matrimony; in regard of the dignitie of the Miniſter, Confirmation; in regrad of diuine worſhip, the Euchariſt: but becauſe one cannot ſay, without a diſtinction, which is more worthy, it is better to omit the Article, which cannot bee vnderſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſubtiltie. Another opinion was, that all the reſpects of dignitie ought to bee expreſſed. And another, that the clauſe ſhould bee added to the Article; that is, according to the diuers reſpects. This opinion was moſt followed, but did much diſpleaſe thoſe, who could not endure that the Synode ſhould abaſe it ſelfe to theſe ſcholaſticall fooleries, (for ſo they called them) and beleeue that CHRIST would haue theſe weake opinions brought into his faith.</p>
            <p>Although that the fourth Article ought to bee condemned; yea, that it was neceſſary to amplifie it, condemning the doctrine of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular; <note place="margin">The fourth Article is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> who will haue the Sacraments to bee but ſignes, by which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17208:128"/>
are diſcerned from infidels; or Actes, and exerciſes of the profeſſion of Chriſtian faith, hauing no other relation to grace, but as ſignes that one hath receiued it. After they treated of condemning thoſe who denye that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments doe conferre grace, to him that putteth not a barre, or doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that grace is contained in the Sacraments and conferred, not by vertue of faith, but <hi>Ex opere operato.</hi> But comming to expound how they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and their cauſalitie, euery one did agree, that grace is gained by all <note place="margin">Whether the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts do confer grace <hi>Ex opere ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato.</hi>
               </note> thoſe actions that excite deuotion, which proceedeth not from the force of the worke it ſelfe, but from the vertue of deuotion, which is in the worker; and theſe are ſaid in the Schooles, to cauſe grace, <hi>Ex opere operantis.</hi> There are other actions which cauſe grace, not by the deuotion of him that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, or of him that receiueth the worke, but by vertue of the worke it ſelfe. Such are the Chriſtian Sacraments, by which, grace is receiued, ſo that there be no barre of mortall ſinne, to exclude it, though there bee not any deuotion. So by the worke of Baptiſme, grace is giuen to the infant, whoſe minde is not mooued toward it, and to one borne a foole, becauſe there is no impediment of ſinne. The Sacrament of Chriſme doeth the like, and that of extreame vnction, though the ſicke man hath loſt his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. But hee that hath mortall ſinne, and doth perſeuere actually, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually, cannot receiue grace, by reaſon of the contrarietie, not becauſe the Sacrament hath not vertue to produce it <hi>Ex opere operato,</hi> but becauſe the receiuer is not capeable, being poſſeſſed with a contrarie qualitie.</p>
            <p>Though they all agreed in this, yet they differed, becauſe the Dominicans did affirme, that how be it grace is a ſpirituall qualitie, created immediately by GOD, yet it is an inſtrumentall and effectiue vertue in the Sacraments, which cauſeth a diſpoſition in the ſoule to receiue it. And therefore it is ſaid that they containe grace; not that it is in them as in a veſſell, but as the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the cauſe, alleadging a ſubtill example, as the chezill is actiue, not onely in ſcabling the ſtone, but in giuing forme to the Statue. The Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans <note place="margin">The <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the manner ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe containe grace.</note> ſaid that it could not be conceiued, how God, being a ſpirituall cauſe, can vſe a corporall inſtrument, for a ſpirituall effect, as is grace; they did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely deny all effectiue or diſpoſitiue vertue in the Sacraments; ſaying they haue no vertue, but by the promiſe of God, that ſo often as they ſhal be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, he will giue his grace to them. Therefore it is ſayd they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, as in an effectuall ſigne, not by any vertue of their owne, but by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine promiſe, of infallible aſſiſtance to the miniſterie. Therefore it is a cauſe, for that the effect doeth follow, not by any vertue of its owne, but by the promiſe of God, to giue grace at that time; as the merite is cauſe of the reward without any actiuitie. This they prooued not onely by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of <hi>Scotus,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> their Diuines, but by Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> alſo who ſaith that grace is receiued by the Sacraments, as a Canon is inueſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the booke, and a biſhop by the ring. The reaſons were expounded on both ſides, with great prolixitie and ſharpeneſſe. And they cenſured one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The Dominicans ſaid, that the other opinion was neere to Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raniſme, and the others, that theirs, being impoſſible, gaue occaſion to the heretikes to calumniate the Church. Some good Prelates deſired though

without effect) to make peace, ſaying, that in regard they agreed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that the Sacraments conteine and are cauſe of grace, it did little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in what manner, and that it was better, not deſcending to particulars, to ſtand in the generall. But the Fryars replied that they ſpake not of words, but of eſtabliſhing, or annihilating the Sacraments. There would neuer haue been an end, if the Legate <hi>Sancta Croce</hi> had not giuen order that they ſhould paſſe to that which remained, and that afterwards they ſhould returne to examine whether it were neceſſary to decide the point, or to leaue it.</p>
            <p>The Legates called vnto them the generals of the orders, and prayed <note place="margin">The Legates vſe meanes to repreſſe the dangerous libertie of the Fryars.</note> them to cauſe the Fryars to treat with modeſtie and charitie, without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie to their owne ſect, ſhewing they were called to ſpeake againſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and not to make new ariſe by diſputes. And they wrote thereof to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhewing how dangerous the libertie was which the Friars did aſſume, and to what it might come. And they told the Pope that a moderation was neceſſary. For there being a fame ſpred of thoſe diſſenſions, and cenſures which one partie pronounced againſt the other, it muſt needs raiſe ſcandall, and ſmall reputation of the Councell.</p>
            <p>It was thought fit to omit the fifth Article, as decided in the former Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But Friar <hi>Bartholmew Miranda</hi> called to minde that <hi>Luther,</hi> by that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox of his, that the Sacraments doe not conferre grace, but by exciting faith, drew alſo a concluſion, that thoſe of the old, and of the Euangelicall law, are of equall vertue; which opinion was to bee condemned, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the doctrine of the Fathers, and the Church; all hauing ſaid, that the olde Sacraments were onely ſignes of grace, but the new conteine it and cauſe it. No man did contradict the concluſion, but the Franciſcans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: that it ſhould not bee ſayd of the old Law, but of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that Circumciſion it ſelfe did cauſe grace: but it was not a Moſaicall Sacrament; for CHRIST alſo ſaid, it was not of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of the Fathers; and alſo becauſe other ſacrifices, before <hi>Abraham,</hi> did conferre, and cauſe grace. The Dominicans replyed that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd plainely, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had receiued the Circumciſion onely for a ſigne; that hee being the firſt vnto whom it was giuen, it is as much as to ſay it was inſtituted onely for a ſigne. And the queſtions of the manner of conteining, and cauſing grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into the field. Friar <hi>Gregorie,</hi> of <hi>Padua,</hi> ſaid hereupon, that it was a cleere caſe in Logique, that things in the ſame kinde haue identitie and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among themſelues. If the old Sacraments and ours had onely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, they would not all bee Sacraments, but equiuocally; if onely iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, they would bee abſolutely the ſame thing. Therefore they muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware to put difficultie in plaine matters for ſome diuerſitie of wordes; and that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had ſayd, that theſe and thoſe, are diuers in the ſigne, but equall in the thing ſignified. And in another place, that they were diuers in the viſible <hi>ſpecies,</hi> but the ſame in the intelligible ſignification; and that elſe where he puts a difference, that thoſe were <hi>promisſiue,</hi> and theſe <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratiue:</hi> which another doth expreſſe in another terme, that thoſe were <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciatiue,</hi> and theſe <hi>contestatiue.</hi> Whence it plainely appeareth, that they agree and differ in many things; which no ſenſible man can deny: and therefore it was wiſedome, not to put that Article in the beginning, neither was it to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:17208:129"/>
any purpoſe to touch it in the preſent Decree. Another opinion came forth, that the opinion of the Lutherans, and Zuinglians, was to bee condemned, without deſcending to the particulars. For they ſay, there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, betweene the old and new Sacraments, but in the Rites. But it hath beene ſhewed, that there are other differences; and therefore, they are to be condemned for this onely, without deſcending to ſhew what thoſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are.</p>
            <p>But the ſixt was cenſured by the Dominicans, who ſaid it was proper to the Euangelicall Sacraments to giue grace, and that the old did not giue it, but onely by the vertue of deuotion: and that this was the opinion of Saint <hi>Thomas.</hi> They alleadged, for a principall ground, the determination of the Florentine Councell, that the Sacraments of the old Law did not cauſe grace, but did figure, that it muſt bee giuen by the paſſion of CHRIST. But Becauſe S. <hi>Bondaenture,</hi> and <hi>Sootus</hi> did maintaine, that the Circumciſion did conferre grace <hi>Ex opere operato, Scotus</hi> adding, that, immediatly after the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> a Sacrament was inſtituted, in which a grace was giuen to babes by vertue of it, that is, <hi>Ex opere operato,</hi> the Franciſcans ſaid the Article was true, and could not be cenſured, and that if, as Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid, children, before CHRIST, were ſaued by the fathers faith, the ſtate of Chriſtians was worſe. For now the fathers faith doth not helpe the children, without Baptiſme; and Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, that the childe that is caried by the father to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, if hee die in the way, is damned. So that if faith onely did then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the condition of the ſonnes of Chriſtians is now worſe. In theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, many did propoſe, that the Article, as probable, ſhould bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
            <p>To leaue out the ſeuenth and eighth, there was a great agreement. But in <note place="margin">Concerning the Character imprinted by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> the ninth of the Chalacter, Friar <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> endeauoured to declare, that it hath foundation in the holy Scripture, and hath euer bin held in the Church for an Apoſtolicull Tradition: and though the name hath not been vſed by the Fathers, yet the thing ſignified is moſt ancient. Others did not grant him ſo great a ſcope, becauſe it did not appeare, that <hi>Gratian,</hi> or the Maſter of the Sentences, had made any mention thereof. Yea, <hi>Iohn Scotius</hi> ſaid, that it was not neceſſary, by the words of the Scripture, or of the Fathers, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it, but onely by the authority of the Church; a thing vſuall with that Doctor, to denie things with a kinde of courteſie. It was worth the know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing what thing they meant it ſhould be, and where ſituated, in ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Schoole-opinions: ſome making it a quality; and amongſt thoſe were foure opinions, according to the foure kindes of the qualities; ſome a ſpirituall power; ſome an habite or diſpoſition; others a ſpirituall figure; and the opinion that it was a ſenſible metaphoricall quality, did not want abettors. Some would haue it a call relation, ſome, a fabrique of the minde; who were to declare how farre it differed from nothing. The ſame variety, of opinions concerning the ſubiect, was trouble ſome; ſome placed it in the effende of the ſoule; ſome in the vnderſtanding; ſome in the will, and there wanted not, who gaue it place in the hands and tongue. <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi> a Dominican Friar, thought that the Sacraments did imprint a ſpirituall quality, before the comming of grace; and that it was of two ſports: one bib
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:17208:130"/>
which can neuer bee aboliſhed, the other which may bee loſt, and regained; the former whereof is called a Character, and the later a certaine ornament. The Sacraments which giue the firſt, cannot bee reiterated, becauſe their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect euer remaineth; the others may, when their effect is loſt. This caried a faire ſhew, but was not approoued by many, becauſe there was no other author to be found of that ornament, but Saint <hi>Thomas;</hi> who alſo, though he begat it, yet did not thinke it worthy of education. But howſoeuer, all agreed in this generall, that three Sacraments haue the Character; yet ſome did ſay modeſtly, that it was to bee approoued as more probable, not as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: <note place="margin">Three Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments haue a Character.</note> others on the contrary, that it was an Article of Faith, becauſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocentius</hi> the third, made mention of it, and was ſo defined by the Councell of <hi>Florence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Article, that the honeſty of the Miniſter was not neceſſary, was ſo diſcuſſed by Saint <hi>Austine,</hi> in ſo many bookes, againſt the Donatiſts, that the Diuines did all agree: and beſides it was alleadged, for a principall ground, that the Article was condemned, by the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> amongſt the errors of <hi>Iohn Wickliefe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They all condemned the eleuenth Article, as contrary to the Scripture, Tradition, and vſe of the vniuerſall Church.</p>
            <p>The twelfth, of the formes of the Sacraments, was diſtinguiſhed, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing two ſences: vnderſtanding by forme, either the eſſentiall words, as it is ſayd, that euery Sacrament hath, for matter, the ſenſible element, and, for forme, the word; or vnderſtanding, by forme, all the forme and rite of the Miniſtery, which includeth many things not neceſſary, but decent. And they thought fit to make two Canons thereof; by the firſt, condemning him of hereſie, that ſayth, that the forme may be changed, being inſtituted by CHRIST. But, for the ſecond ſenſe, though accidentall things may receiue mutation, yet when any rite is brought in by publike authority, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and confirmed by common vſe, it ſhould not be in euery mans power to change it, but onely in the Popes, as Head of the Church vniuerſall, when it is conuenient for ſome new reſpect.</p>
            <p>In the thirteenth, of the intention of the Miniſter, they could not diſſent from the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> which holds it neceſſary: but what intention <note place="margin">Concerning the intention of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> was required, was hard to expreſſe, in regard of the variety of opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the efficacie and vertue of the Sacraments: becauſe there cannot bee the ſame intention of two, who haue diuers opinions. The common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere was, that the intention to doe as the Church did, was ſufficient. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this expoſition, the difficulties remained, for that mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions what the Church is, beeing diuers, their intention in adminiſtring the Sacrament, would prooue various alſo. It ſeemed they might ſay, it was not different, when all had the ſame aime, to doe that which hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by CHRIST, and obſerued by the Church, though a falſe Church be taken for a true ſo that the rite of the one and the other be the ſame.</p>
            <p>In this particular, the Biſhop of <hi>Minori</hi> propoſed a thing worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated <note place="margin">A diſcourſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Minori</hi> about the intention of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</note> heere, and eſteemed by all to deſerue great conſideration. Hee ſayd, that to the Lutherans, who giue no other vertue to the Sacraments, then to excite faith, which notwithſtanding may bee ſtirred vp ſome other way, it
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17208:130"/>
did little import to receiue the true Sacrament. Whereupon they ſay it is not neceſſary, and thinke it not conuenient, that the malice of a wicked Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, who hath no intention to conferre the true Sacrament, ſhould bee able to hurt, becauſe wee are to regard what the faithfull receiueth, and not what is giuen. But amongſt the Catholikes, who doe truely attribute to the Sacrament power to giue grace to him that doeth not reſiſt it, ſeeing it happeneth very ſeldome, that grace is obtained by any other meanes, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly little children, and many who haue but ſmall vnderſtanding, are ſaued no other way. And ordinary men haue ſo weake a diſpoſition, that it would not ſuffice without the Sacrament. And thoſe few, who, as <hi>Phonixes,</hi> haue a perfect diſpoſition, yet doe receiue greater grace by the Sacrament. Therefore it much concerneth a Chriſtian to bee aſſured, that hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that which is true and effectuall. If a Prieſt, hauing charge of foure or fiue thouſand ſoules, were an infidell, but a formall hypocrite, and in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing the penitent, baptizing of children, and conſecrating the Euchariſt, had an intention not to doe what the Church doeth, it muſt bee ſayd that the children are damned, the penitent not abſolued, and that all remaine without the fruit of the Communion. Neither is it enough to ſay, that faith ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; becauſe it doth not helpe children at all, according to the Catholike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor others, ſo much as the Sacrament: and to attribute ſo great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to faith, were to take all vertue from the Sacraments, and to fall into the Lutheran opinion.</p>
            <p>Hee conſidered how a tender Father would be afflicted when his ſonne was about to die, if hee doubted of the intenſion of the baptizing Prieſt. So hee that feeleth himſelfe of a weake diſpoſition, and is to bee baptized, what anxietie will he haue, that perhaps the Prieſt is a counterfeit Chriſtian, and mocketh him, not meaning to baptize him, but onely to waſh him in ieſt. And the ſame may bee feared in confeſſion, and receiuing the Euchariſt. He added, if any ſayd theſe caſes were rare, would to God it were ſo, and that, in this corrupt age, wee had not cauſe to doubt they were many. But ſuppoſe they are very few, or but one onely. Let there bee a knaue Prieſt, who fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and hath not an intention to adminiſter the true Baptiſme to a childe, who after, being a man growen, is created Biſhop of a great Citie, and liueth many yeeres in that charge, ſo that hee hath ordained a great part of the Prieſts; it muſt bee ſaid, that hee, being not baptized, is not ordained, nor they ordained, who are promoted by him. So, in that great Citie, there will bee neither Euchariſt, nor Confeſſion, becauſe they cannot bee without the Sacrament of order, nor order without a true Biſhop, neither can hee receiue order who is not baptized. Behold millions of nullities of Sacraments, by the malice of one Miniſter, in one Acte onely. And hee that thinketh that God ſupplyeth by his omnipotency, and prouideth againſt theſe dayly occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences by extraordinary remedies, will ſooner make one beleeue that God, by his prouidence, hath prouided that ſuch accidents ſhould not happen. Therefore the Biſhop ſaid to euery inconuenience; God hath made proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion heerein, by ordaining that to bee a Sacrament which is adminiſtred, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rite inſtituted by himſelfe, though the Miniſter haue another inward intention. And hee added that this doeth not croſſe the common
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:17208:131"/>
doctrine of the Diuines, or the determination of the Florentine Councell, which requireth intention, becauſe the inward intention is not to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but that which is manifeſted by the externall worke, though inwardly it bee contrary. And ſo all inconueniences are remooued, which otherwiſe are innumerable. Hee brought many reaſons for proofe, and at laſt the example written by <hi>Sozomene;</hi> That the children of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being at play by the Sea ſide, did imitate, in ieſt, the actions vſed in the Church, and <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> created Biſhop of the play, did baptize other children not baptized before; whereof <hi>Alexander,</hi> of famous memorie; Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Athanaſius</hi> being a child did baptize other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> aduertized, he was troubled at it, and called the children, and asked what their Biſhop had done, and ſaid vnto them: and vnderſtanding that all the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall rite was obſerued, by the Counſell of other Prieſts, did approoue the baptiſme; which could not bee maintained, if ſuch an intention, as others ſpake of, were required, but might well bee in that manner that himſelfe did expreſſe it.</p>
            <p>The Diuines did not approoue this doctrine, yet were troubled, and <note place="margin">The opinion of the Biſhop of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </hi> was not receiued. But a yeere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a little Booke to ſhew that the Synod was of his minde.</note> knew not how to reſolue the reaſon: But they ſtill defended that the true intention of the Miniſter was neceſſary, either actuall, or virtuall, and that without it the Sacrament was not of force, notwithſtanding any externall demonſtration. I muſt not refraine to ſhew alſo (though it bee an antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the fit time) that howſoeuer the Synode did after determine ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely that the intention of the Miniſter is neceſſary, yet this Prelate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained firme, and, in a little Booke that hee wrote of this Subiect a yeere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did ſay that the Synode of <hi>Trent</hi> was of his opinion, and that the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination ought to bee vnderſtood in his ſence. There was no difficultie in condemning the laſt Article, by reaſon of that which hath beene ſaid by others.</p>
            <p>The matter of Baptiſme, in the third Article, gaue them greater trouble, what that Baptiſme is, which is giuen by the heretikes. All grounded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpon the Schoole-doctrine, receiued by the Florentine Councel, that a Sacrament requireth matter, forme, and intention, and that water is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the expreſſion of the Act in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, the forme; and to doe what the Church doeth, the intention. Whereupon they eſtabliſhed an vndoubted concluſion, that thoſe heretikes haue true baptiſme, and agree with vs in theſe three things; which they ſayd was receiued by an Apoſtolicall tradition, eſtabliſhed long before by Pope <hi>Stephanus</hi> the firſt, in the beginning of the third age, and approoued by all the Church following. But thoſe that vnderſtand antiquitie doe know, that this was not the opinion of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> in whoſe time, matter, forme, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention were not heard of. For that Pope did thinke abſolutely that thoſe who were conuerted from any hereſie whatſoeuer, ought not to bee rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; though, in thoſe times, the heretikes, except ſome few <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> were <hi>Gnoſtiques,</hi> who vſed extrauagant baptiſmes, by reaſon of the exorbitant opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which they held, of the diuinitie, and perſon of CHRIST. And it is certaine that thoſe Baptiſmes had not the forme which is vſed now, and yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did the receiue to repentance, euery ſort of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes indifferently, without rebaptizing them. The Biſhops of <hi>Africa</hi> and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17208:131"/>
               <hi>Cappadocia</hi> were directly oppoſite, ſaying, that all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>iſts</hi> ſhould: The Councell of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did name many heretikes which were to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized; and others to bee receiued to baptiſme with them, in whom it would bee hard to ſhew that the ſame forme was vſed. But (which is of more importance) Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> doeth witneſſe, that the <hi>Nouations, Eucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, Saccofors</hi> were not rebaptized in <hi>Rome,</hi> whom notwithſtanding hee did rebaptize; neither did that Saint thinke this diuerſitie to bee abſurd: onely hee ſaid, it would bee good to aſſemble many Biſhops to reſloue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an vniforme proceeding. But giuing no more heede to theſe things then to fables, they held the current doctrine, that an heretike doth truely bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, if he vſeth the words, and hath the intention of the Church.</p>
            <p>The fourth Article; that Baptiſme was Repentance, in regard of the force of the ſpeech, was held by many not to bee falſe, alleadging the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt, who ſaith, that <hi>Iohn</hi> preached <hi>the Baptiſme of Repentance;</hi> and that <hi>Paul,</hi> in the ſixt to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> calleth Baptiſme by the name of <hi>Repentance.</hi> And ſo many Fathers haue ſayd the ſame, that the Article could not bee condemned, except it did ſay: that Baptiſme was the Sacrament of Penance. But becauſe it ſeemed in this ſence to bee the ſame with the ſixteenth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, many thought fit to leaue it.</p>
            <p>The 9. and 10. belonging to the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> many were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they ought to bee omitted. For not ſpeaking of thoſe of the old law, it was leſſe fit to ſpeake of that which was in the middle, in regard their ſcope was to handle the Sacraments of the new law. But others ſaid, that the heretikes minde was, not to exalt the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and to make it equall <note place="margin">Whether the Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; Chriſt be equall.</note> with that of CHRIST, but to abaſe that of CHRIST, and to make it equall with <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme; inferring, that, as this did not giue grace, but was a pure ſignification, ſo was ours alſo, which is a moſt formall hereſie.</p>
            <p>In the eleuenth of the Rites, ſome would haue the ſubſtantials diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from others, and ſaid, that thoſe onely cannot be omitted without ſinne. Others would exclude the caſe of neceſſitie onely, and that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it was not lawfull to omit any whatſoeuer; for in regard the Church, gouerned by the holy Ghoſt, hath ordained them, they are neceſſary by the precept, though not by the ſubſtance of the Sacrament. They alleadged many Chapters of the Popes, and Councels, all which would prooue vaine, if euery one might change as he liſteth. That part which ſpeaketh of immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though it bee a more expreſſe figure of the death, buriall, and reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of CHRIST, yet it was condemned by all, and many places of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were alledged, where aſperſion, or effuſion of water is ſpoken of, all which, they ſayd, ought literally to be vnderſtood of baptiſme.</p>
            <p>All ſet themſelues againſt thoſe three which ſpeake of the baptiſme of children, alleadging the doctrine of the ancient Fathers and Schoolemen; and many inuectiues were made againſt <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> attributing vnto him the <note place="margin">

            <p>They concluded, that the ſixteenth was conteined in the former Articles, becauſe it did take away Penance, one of the ſeuen ſacrament. But all ſaid, that the laſt was contrary to the proper miniſtry of baptiſme, in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning whereof the catechized is admoniſhed; that if hee will haue eternall life, it is neceſſary to obſerue all the commandements.</p>
            <p>In the Articles about confirmation, there was no difference; and all, <note place="margin">Of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Chriſme, <hi>and</hi> Vnction.</note> for their ground, did alleadge the Councel of <hi>Florence.</hi> And that which is ſaid in the third Article, that yong men did formerly giue an account of their faith in the preſence of the Church, was generally decided, that, not beeing vſed in theſe times, one ought to beleeue it was neuer vſed before; for the Church would neuer haue intermitted that ceremonie. Many places of Councels and ancient writers were alleadged, making mention of Chriſme, and Vnction, which cannot agree to inſtruction or examination.

            <p>Vpon the laſt article there was much difficultie, in regard Saint <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Whether one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Biſhop be miniſter of <hi>Confirmation.</hi>
               </note> the Pope, did graunt the miniſtery to ſimple Prieſts. The Franciſcans, according to the doctrine of Saint <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> followed by <hi>Iohn Scotus,</hi> and their order, which doeth attribute the miniſtery to the Biſhop onely, as Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixt did alſo maintaine, anſwered, that it was a permiſſion onely for that time, and againſt the Popes will, to auoide the ſcandall of thoſe people: or elſe that the Vnction, permitted by <hi>Gregorie,</hi> was not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of confirmation. Which anſwere not pleaſing Saint <hi>Thomas;</hi> becauſe it did not wholly free the Pope from hauing erred, hee found a temper, and ſaid, that though the Biſhop bee the miniſter of Confirmation, yet, with the Popes permiſſion, it may bee adminiſtred by the Prieſt. Others oppoſed, and ſaid that the doctrine of the Romane Church was abſolute, that the miniſters of Sacraments are inſtituted by CHRIST, whom though the Pope can command to the exerciſe of the miniſterie, yet hee cannot make the Sacrament to be of force that is adminiſtred by others, nor nullifie that which is conferred by the miniſter, inſtituted by CHRIST, though againſt his commandement. And therefore if CHRIST hath inſtituted the Biſhop for miniſter, the Pope cannot make that grant to the Prieſt; if CHRIST hath granted that the Prieſt may doe it, the Pope cannot hinder him. For it would ſeeme a ſtrange thing, that in the other Sacraments, being all of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neceſſitie, CHRIST ſhould preſcribe the miniſter, without leauing any libertie vnto men, and in this, which may at any time bee deferred, vſe a ſingularitie, whereof, for ſixe hundred yeeres, vntill the time of <hi>Gregorie,</hi> no man had made any mention, building an Article of faith vpon foure words, ſpoken by occaſion: and if the epiſtle had been loſt, no man would euer haue inuented that diſtinction, vnuſuall in ſuch a matter, nor to bee applied to any thing but to this place of <hi>Gregorie.</hi>

Others, being not ſatisfied with the reſolution of either party, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the words of the Florentine Councell ſhould bee taken. Some thought fit, onely to condemne him that would ſay, that the Prieſt, and not the Biſhop onely, is the ordinary Miniſter; giuing by the word (ordinary) power to inferre, therefore there is another extraordinary, or to ſay, that there can bee no other, becauſe the Sacraments haue no Miniſter, but Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie.</p>
            <p>While the forenamed Articles, were diſcuſſed by the Diuines, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation <note place="margin">A Decree of Reformation conteyning ſixe heads.</note> of the Canoniſts, aſſembled to collect, and remedie the abuſes, concerning the Sacraments in generall, and, in particular, of Baptiſme, and Confirmation, a Decree was made conteyning ſixe heads: which ſaid thus in ſubſtance. That the Synode, deſiring to remooue the abuſes, brought in by men or time, and to teach the Miniſters of Churches, and all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, how to gouerne themſelues in obſeruing, miniſtring, and receiuing the Sacraments, doeth ordaine. 1. That the Eccleſiaſticall Sacraments, ſhall bee freely conferred, without taking or demanding any thing for them, vnder any pretence whatſoeuer, and no cheſt, veſſell, cloath, or any ſuch thing ſhall bee ſhewed, by which a demand may bee intimated; nor the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſhall bee denied, or deferred, vpon pretence of any long and ancient cuſtome, not to conferre them before ſome certaine ſtipend bee paid, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of ſome debt, conſidering that neither cuſtome, or length of time, doeth diminiſh the ſinne, but rather increaſeth it: and the offenders ſhall bee puniſhed according to the lawes, made againſt ſymoniacall perſons. 2. The Sacrament of Baptiſme, ſhall not bee conferred in prophane places, but in Churches onely, except in caſe of neceſſitie, and when the children of Kings, and Princes are to be baptized, according to the conſtitution of <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth; which ſhall not take place in all that haue dominion, but onely in great Princes. Neither ſhall the Biſhop giue the Chriſme, but in ſeemely ornaments, and in the Churches, ſacred places, or Epiſcopall houſes. 3. The Sacrament of Baptiſme ſhall bee adminiſtred by able Prieſts, in the mother Churches onely, except, by reaſon of great difficulty to goe to them, the Biſhop thinke fit to grant it to other Churches, or that it hath been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time out of minde: in which Churches, holy water, taken from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church, ſhall bee kept in a cleane and decent veſſell. 4. In Baptiſme and Chriſme, there ſhall bee allowed but one God-father, who ſhall neither bee infamous, nor excommunicated, nor interdicted, nor vnder age, nor a Monke, nor any that cannot performe what he promiſeth. And in Chriſme, hee ſhall not bee receiued for a god-father, who hath not receiued Chriſme himſelfe. 5. To take away the abuſe, practiſed in many places, to carry about the water of Baptiſme, or chriſtened children, with their forehead bound, to make many god-fathers, by waſhing of the hands, or looſing the forehead, the Prieſts, in regard no compaternity is contracted by theſe meanes, ſhall not permit the water of Baptiſme to bee carried out of the Church, but ſhall cauſe it to bee caſt into the Sacrary, and the Font to bee ſhut vp. And the Biſhops, when they giue the Chriſme, ſhall make two clerkes ſtand at the Church doore, to vntie and waſh the foreheads, of thoſe that haue receiued the Chriſme, not ſuffering any that is tied to goe out of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17208:133"/>
the Church. 6. The Biſhops ſhall bee diligently carefull, not to confirme any who is excommunicated, interdicted, or in mortall ſinne.</p>
            <p>And though the Canoniſts did more eaſily agree in theſe Decrees, then the Theologues in their diſcuſſions, yet ſome differences were amongſt them; for reſolution whereof, becauſe after long diſputation, they could not agree, they put them informe, and referred the deciſion to the generall Congregation. The firſt doubt was, whether vnto theſe wordes, that <note place="margin">Difficulties referred to the generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</note> is, that nothing ſhall be required or demanded, it ſhould bee added, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The ſecond, whether they ſhould adde theſe words; vnder pretence of any cuſtome whatſoeuer. The third, whether they ſhould vſe ſome words, to ſignifie, that the Synode doeth not prohibite valuntary oblations, or doth prohibite them onely, when they are giuen in regard of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not for other reſpects of pietie, or whether the Decree ſhould bee left in its vniuerſality.</p>
            <p>But there was the ſame difficulty, in the generall Congregation, impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">In which they could not be decided.</note> to bee reconciled. Thoſe that required the additions, not to receiue, or pretend cuſtome, alleadged the Goſpel; <hi>Freely you haue receiued, freely giue;</hi> and many Canons, <hi>anathematizing</hi> him that giueth or receiueth a temporall thing, for a ſpirituall. That cuſtome, againſt the law of God and nature, is corruption, and cannot take place. That in the title of ſimonie, the cuſtome of giuing, or receiuing, for poſſeſſion of benefices, benedictions of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, for burials, benediction of the Chriſme, for oyle, or for the ground of the buriall, is reprehended and condemned. Which the rather ought to be applyed to the Sacraments, in regard, if that bee not prohibited, nothing is done, becauſe the corruption is vſed in all places, and euery one will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelfe with it. That as the cuſtome of receiuing any thing before, is condemned in the Decree, ſo the cuſtome to receiue after, ought to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, by the ſame reaſon; or elſe, by condemning that, this is approoued. And for voluntary oblations, they would haue it generally forbid, to giue or receiue any thing a little before, or a little after, for any reſpect whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; becauſe, in reſpect of the time, one may preſume that it is giuen for the Sacrament. And heere the gloſſe was alledged, which ſaith, that howſoeuer it is a worke of pietie, to put money into the boxe, yet to doe it in time of receiuing the Sacrament, breedeth ſuſpition of ſimonie: and therefore that the time is to bee reſpected, which may make a thing ſeeme euill, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe may bee accounted good. That God doeth command, <hi>to take away all occaſion of ſcandall,</hi> and <hi>to abſteine from all appearance of euill.</hi> And therefore that the Sacraments may bee purely adminiſtred, they would haue voluntary oblations abſolutely forbid, in time of adminiſtring the Sacraments, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the faithfull, to vſe them, in other times and occaſions.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide was alleadged, that the fourth Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> granteth the receiuing of what is offered for baptizing of Children; and that the Diuines, hauing determined that no temporall thing ſhall be receiued for the Sacrament, doe conſent withall, that one may receiue for the paines in adminiſtring them, and much rather when it is giuen or receiued, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Sacrament, but by way of almes, or elſe the Laity would haue no occaſions to exerciſe workes of charity, and the poore Curates would not
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:17208:133"/>
be able to liue. They alleadged the authoritie of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> That it is not lawfull to muzzel the Oxe that treadeth the corne, and that he that ſerueth at the altar ſhould liue by it. That it ſhould neuer be confeſſed that any cuſtome is introduced to giue or receiue any thing, for the miniſtring of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; becauſe it being generally vſed, it would bee as much as to ſay, that a pernicious abuſe hath beene tolerated, yea approued in the Church vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall. Therefore that they ought not to ſpeake of breaking a cuſtome that was neuer in vſe; leaſt thinking to remedy that which is not euill, but ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed by the tenderneſſe of ſome mens conſciences, the Church ſhould receiue a mortall wound. Their principall reaſon was that <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, in the generall Councell, in the Chapter, <hi>Ad Apostolicam,</hi> doeth not onely declare the cuſtome of making oblations, in the adminiſtration of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, to be lawfull, and ordaine it ſhould bee obſerued, but that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſhould be puniſhed, in caſe he ſhould go about to change it. Therefore to determine the contrary now, would be to condemne, very ſcandalouſly, a Pope &amp; a general Councel, as approuers and defenders of a pernicious error.</p>
            <p>It was replyed by the other ſide, that the Statute of the Councell of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> doth condemne, ſeuerely, the exaction, and doth tolerate the voluntary oblation: but that it was amended by the Councell of <hi>Heliberum,</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth the vſe, obſerued in thoſe times, that the baptized ſhould put ſome money into the font. That the inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Diuines, diſtinguiſhed the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Sacrament from the paines in adminiſtring it, and the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to receiue in reſpect of the Sacrament, or of ſome thing elſe, and that of the firſt and ſecond intention, are metaphyſicall, and chimericall, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the words of the Goſpell, are deliuered in abſolute termes, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to cauill, or gloſſes, which doe marre the Text: That God by <hi>Moyſes</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> prohibiting the muzzell, doth meane that food ſhould not bee denyed to the hungry beaſt, yet that he ſhould not be filled with ſuperfluity. That the pouertie of the Cleargie could not be pretended, hauing not onely competent, but abundant reuenues. That the abuſe is that the gouernors of Churches reſide not in their benefices, and yet will receiue all the fruites, hiring the incertaintie to poore ſeely Prieſts, who are forced to ſell all to keepe themſelues aliue. That they ſhould rather make prouiſion that all ſhould reſide, by which meanes they would haue more then enough for their maintenance, and ſhould not need to ſell the Sacraments. And by this occaſion they began againe to dilate of reſidencie, and of the good that would follow declaring it to bee, <hi>De iure diuino.</hi> That if any benefice with cure of ſoules bee ſmall, prouiſion ſhould bee made, by vniting other ſimple benefices, and in caſe there were no other way, by cauſing the people to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute for their maintenance. That it is better, and pleaſeth God more to confeſſe the error paſt, and to redreſſe it, then to defend it, and perſeuere. And the Cardinall of <hi>Monte,</hi> who otherwiſe did not ſeeme inclined to refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, was peremptory in this, anſwering thoſe that alleadged the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, and the generall Councel, that they did great wrong to that Pope and thoſe Fathers, to ſay they defended ſo great an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, and that they ſhewed their ignorance. For if they reade the 3 chapter of the ſame Councell, which is the third before that which they haue alledged,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:17208:134"/>
they might haue ſeene the meaning very plainely, and how thoſe Fathers did forbid all exactions, condemning alſo the cuſtome to the contrary. And, in that Chapter, the cuſtomes to giue any thing for adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not allowed, but others, being lawfull, honeſt, and in fauour of the Church, are permitted, as tenthes, firſt fruites, oblations vſually made to the altars, canonicall portions and ſuch other laudable vſances; alleadging that the Chapter was ſo vnderſtood by <hi>Bartolus</hi> and <hi>Romanus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fathers deputed to make the decrees in matter of faith conſidering <note place="margin">Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes <hi>framed.</hi>
               </note> the opinions of the Diuines, and the concluſions in which they agreed, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and diſtinguiſhing the Articles according to their direction, and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them in a better order, framed 24. <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> concerning the Sacraments in generall, ten of Baptiſme, and three of <hi>Chriſme:</hi> which were expreſſed in ſuch a forme, as that no Catholique opinion was condemned, and all parties ſatiſfied. But in compoſing the <hi>Heads</hi> to expreſſe the doctrine, <note place="margin">It was hard to expreſſe the doctrine, and to diſpleaſe no perſons,</note> as was done in iuſtification, it was not poſſible to vſe the tearmes of one opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but that another ſeemed to be diſallowed; which neither pleaſed the Doctors for the affection they bare to their owne ſect, nor the Legates and Neutrals, for feare of ſowing new diuiſions: But not beeing able to expreſſe the doctrine ſo nicely, but that more then one of the parties would bee loſt, they referred it to the generall congregation, to define how the Sacraments doe containe and cauſe grace.</p>
            <p>The Congregation was no leſſe perplexed then the Deputies. One part inclined to omit wholy the matter of doctrine, and to paſſe with the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiſmes</hi> onely, as they did in originall ſinne. Another part would haue the doctrine by all meanes, alleadging the reaſons vſed, when they treated of iuſtification; that it was neceſſary to follow the example then begun: and that all diligence ſhould be vſed to ſatisfie all parties. But at the laſt they ſayd it muſt be done, and that there was no danger of diuiſion. For the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, preſent in Councel, though they ſharply defend their owne opinions, yet they doe referre themſelues to the Synode, which the abſent will aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe alſo. Therefore they ſhould not refraine to doe the buſineſſe exactly, that the heretiques may be conuinced. This opinion had preuailed, but that <hi>Iohn Baptista Cigala,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Albenga,</hi> and <hi>Auditor</hi> of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> did ſtrongly oppoſe: who ſaid, it was neuer found in any Story, that euer any man was willing to haue his opinion condemned, and though all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques referre themſelues to the iudgement of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet, if their opinion were reiected, they would not referre it, but defend it more obſtinately, fortifying the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues the more by reaſon of oppoſition; by which meanes, of ſectes, hereſies doe ſpring. Therefore that the beſt way was to tolerate all the opinions, and to take care that none condemne another, but that all may liue in peace. Neither is there ſuch contrarietie betweene them, that vſing this moderation, any inconuenience can ariſe; whereas, without it, euery verball difference or little trifle is able to deuide the whole world. That many opinions of the moderne innouators might haue been tollerated, if they had beene modeſtly maintained, without condemning the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the doctrine of the Schooles.

In ſum, the wife Prelate ſaid, that the vſuall proteſtations of the Doctors to referre themſelues to the Church, were termes of good maners and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which ſhould be anſwered with as much reſpect, by keeping theſelues neutrall between the contrarieties.

            <p>In the Congregation of the fifteenth of Ianuarie, when the Articles of the Sacraments were giuen out, the matter, begun the day before, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill, in regard many doe not reſide becauſe they are not fit to exerciſe the charge, with the pluralitie of Benefices they handled the qualities and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions required in Biſhops. They began with that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in biſhops and Deacons, inſiſting much vpon the words, <hi>irreprehenſible,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The qualities and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons required in Biſhops.</note> giuen to hoſpitalitie, not couetous, not new in Religion, and eſteemed by ſtrangers. Afterwards other conditions, required by many Canons, were alleadged, wherein there was no difficultie, all vniformely declaiming againſt the vices and defects of the Prelates and Clergie. This diſpleaſed not the Legates, being content to ſee the Prelates entertaine themſelues with this ſhadow of libertie. But in the heate of ſpeaking, <hi>Iohn Salazar</hi> biſhop of <hi>Lanciano,</hi> attributed the beginning of all to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing biſhoprickes, regarded not the ſufficiencie of the perſons, but ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices performed. Whereunto the biſhop o <hi>Bitonto,</hi> who ſpake a little after, replyed with much feeling, and ſayd, that the fault of others was vniuſtly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Court. For in <hi>Germanie</hi> biſhoprickes are giuen by election, in <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Hungarie,</hi> by the Kings nomination; and in <hi>Italie</hi> many doe belong to particular Patrons; and to thoſe that are free, the princes doe recommend, and will not be denyed, taking all libertie from the Pope. But he that will not bee tranſported by opinion, but iudge ſincerely, will ſee that thoſe who are made freely at <hi>Rome</hi> are the beſt of all <hi>Europe.</hi> Pluralitie of benefices, vnknowen to the firſt ages, hath not beene brought in by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> but by biſhops and Princes, before the Popes tooke vpon them to regulate the matter of benefices throughout all Chriſtendome: and, but for the prouiſions which are to bee found in the bodie of the Canon Law, the diſorder would haue beene alreadie mounted to the height.

But I will begin from the time when the Name of the Church was appropriated to the Clergie onely, all other Chriſtians beeing excluded; when that was applyed to few, which belonged to all, and to the rich, that which firſt ſerued for the poore. I ſay in the beginning of thoſe times, the Clergie hauing diuided amongſt themſelues all the reuenewes of the Church, the charges, which before were called miniſteries and offices of ſpirituall care, the temporalitie beeing now moſt eſteemed, were named benefices. And yet ſo long as the old Canons remained, that one man ſhould not bee ordained vnto two titles, none could haue more then one Benefice. But the reuenues being by warres or inundations diminiſhed, and become not ſufficient for their maintenance, one man might hold two, yet ſo as that hee ſhould attend them both.

But the world beeing ſcandalized hereat, there was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration vſed; wherevpon the diſtinction began of men tyed to reſidencie, and not tied, and of benefices compatible and not compatible calling thoſe of reſidencie incompatible one with another, and the other compatible with theſe and with themſelues. Yet the gloſſe of the Canoniſts alwayes decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">How the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Benefices compatible &amp; incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible began.</note> (to make a ſhew of honeſtie) that many benefices ſhould not bee giuen to one, but when one is not ſufficient for maintenance. But they cut this ſufficiencie very large, proportioning it not to the perſon but to the qualitie, not eſteeming it ſufficient for an ordinary Prieſt, if it were not enough for himſelfe, the family of his parents, three ſeruants, and an horſe: and more, if hee were noble or learned. And it is ſtrange how much they allowed for a Biſhop, in regard of the <hi>Decorum</hi> hee is to keepe. For Cardinals, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to note the common ſaying of the Court, that they are equall vnto Kings; by which they conclude, that no reuenew is too much for them, except it be more then enough for a King. The cuſtome being begun, and neither the world, nor equitie being able to reſiſt it, the Popes reſerued to themſelues

power to diſpenſe with the incompatible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to haue more then two of the others. But to finde a colourble way to put this in practiſe, they layd hold on <hi>Commendaes,</hi> a thing inſtituted at the firſt to good purpoſe, but after vſed to this end onely. For when, by reaſon of warres, peſtilence, and other ſuch cauſes, the election or prouiſion could not be made ſo ſoone, the ſuperiour did recommend the vacant Church, to ſome honeſt and worthy man, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne <note place="margin">How <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendaes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In progreſſe of time the <hi>Commendataries,</hi> by diuers pretences of honeſty and neceſſitie, made vſe of the fruits, and, to enioy them the longer, ſought meanes to hinder the prouiſion. For remedy whereof, order was taken, that the <hi>Commenda</hi> ſhould not laſt longer then ſix months<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the Popes, by the plenitude of their power, did paſſe theſe limits, and commended for a longer time, and at the laſt, for the life of the <hi>Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie,</hi> giuing him power to vſe the fruits, beſides the neceſſary charges. This good inuention; ſo degenerated, was vſed in the corrupted times, for a cloake of pluralitie: obſeruing the words of the law, to giue but one bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to one man, contrary to the ſence; in regard that a <hi>Commendatarie</hi> for life, is the ſame in reality with the titular? Great exorbitances were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, in the number of the benefices commended; ſo that, after the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therane ſtirs began, and all men demanded reformation, <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeuenth in the yeere 1534. was not aſhamed to commend vnto his Nephew <hi>Hippoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Cardinall de' Medicis,</hi> all the benefices of the world, ſecular, and regular, dignities, and parſonages, ſimple, and with cure, being vacant, for ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, <note place="margin">

But an inconuenience did ariſe, becauſe the number of benefices did decreaſe, and the fauour done to one, was done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to many, without merit or demand, to the great dammage of the <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Chancery.</hi> And this was remedied, with a ſubtile and wittie inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to vnite as many benefices as pleaſed the Pope, onely during the life of him vpon whom they were conferred, by whoſe death the vnion was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to bee diſſolued, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> and the benefices returned to their firſt ſtate. So they ſhewed the world their excellent inuentions, conferring a benefice, which was but one in ſhew, but many in deed; as one confeſſed hee had ſtollen a bridle, concealing it was vpon a horſe head, which hee ſtole with it.</p>
            <p>To remedy pluralitie, it was neceſſary to remooue the abuſe of theſe three

pretences. This the wiſer ſort of Prelates vnderſtanding, agreed vniformely at the firſt propoſe, to inhibite all, of what condition ſoeuer, to haue more then three benefices. And ſome added, when two amount not to the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew of foure hundred ducats of gold: and that if one were worth ſo much, no man whatſoeuer ſhould haue any more, nor more then three, though they were not worth ſo much. Of this there was much diſputation; and <note place="margin">A diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valitie.</hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited,</hi> or <hi>commended,</hi> or poſſeſſed by any othertitle. To this opinion the Biſhop of <hi>Feltre</hi> did adhere, but did moderate it, by diſtinguiſhing <hi>Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Commendaes,</hi> and <hi>Vnions:</hi> ſaying, that ſome were made for the good of the Churches, and ſome in fauour of the poſſeſſor: deſiring that the former ſhould remaine in force, and the other ſhould be regulated. The Biſhop of <hi>Lanciano</hi> did not admit this diſtinction: ſaying, that hee that would make a laſting law, muſt not put exceptions into the body of it, in regard the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of man is apt to inuent them, and to free themſelues from the rule. The Byſhop of <hi>Albenga</hi> made a long oration to ſhew, that good lawes doe regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <note place="margin">Lawes ought to looke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward onely, and not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> the future onely, and that hee, who, not containing himſelfe within the bounds of reaſon, will amend that which is paſt, doth euer raiſe tumults, and in ſtead of reforming, make a greater deformation: that it were ſtrange to depriue men of their poſſeſſions, and perſwade them to be content. Hee added, that he foreſaw, that if ſuch a Decree were made, either it would not be receiued, or if it were, would cauſe colourable and ſimoniacall reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and greater miſchiefes then plurality could. For hereafter, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion ſeemed vnto him ſuperfluous: for no man beeing to haue more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices but by the Popes diſpenſation, it ſufficed that he was reſolued not to diſpence.</p>
            <p>In that Congregation, amongſt many tragicall exclamations, made by diuers men, <hi>Bernardus Dias,</hi> Byſhop of <hi>Calabora,</hi> ſaid that the Church of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza</hi> was ſo diſordered, as all men knew, that it required rather an Apoſtle then a Biſhop; taxing the Cardinall <hi>Ridolfi,</hi> who poſſeſſed that Biſhopricke, beſides many other benefices, not gouerning it, nor hauing the Epiſcopall order, neuer ſeeing it, nor knowing any thing but the rents. And euery one ſpake againſt the inconuenience, that famous Churches ſhould neuer ſee their Biſhops, becauſe they were imployed in other Biſhoprickes, or more benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall dignities. Some ſaid, that the Pope onely might prouide againſt this, and were of the opinion of <hi>Albenga,</hi> that he alone might make the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This pleaſed the Legates, as well for the Popes dignity, as to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from taking paines in this matter, which, in regard of the varietie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and intereſts, they thought would bee of an hard digeſtion: hoping that when they had gone ſo farre as to leaue this reformation to the Pope, they ſhould eaſily leaue alſo vnto him the point of reſidencie, which was as hard to be concocted, for that it was popular, and drew with it the regaining
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:17208:136"/>
of the Epiſcopall authoritie and iuriſdiction. Therefore the Legates, being in hope that it might bee obtained, eſpecially if it were propoſed as a thing done, not to bee done, they preſently ſent the Pope word of it, who was glad of the newes, becauſe both the Court and himſelfe were doubtfull where the attempts and deſignes of the Prelates might end. And thinking fit to ſtrike the yron while it was hote, hee made a greater ſtride then the Legates would haue had him, and diſpatched a Bull, by which hee recalled vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the whole buſineſſe of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> But in <hi>Trent</hi> whilſt an anſwere was expected from <hi>Rome,</hi> they proceeded in the treatie begun, and made a draught of the Decree, that no man ſhould haue more then one Biſhoprike, and hee that had more ſhould quit the reſt; that heereafter whoſoeuer ſhall obtaine many inferiour incompatible Benefices, ſhall bee depriued without further declaration; and hee that formerly hath poſſeſſed more then one, ſhall ſhew his diſpenſations to the Ordinarie, who ſhall proceede according to the <hi>Decretall</hi> of <hi>Innocentius 4. Ordinarij.</hi> In giuing their voyces vpon theſe points, many deſired to haue diſpenſations forbid. The ſhewing of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, <note place="margin">Of diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie.</note> and the proceeding according to the Decree of <hi>Innocentius,</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but few; becauſe it was a kinde of approbation of them all, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of the miſchiefe. For <hi>Innocentius</hi> ſaith, that if the diſpenſations bee found good, they ſhall bee admitted, if there bee any doubt, recourſe ſhall bee had to <hi>Rome,</hi> in which caſe no man doubted, but that any of them might bee doubted of, and receiue a declaration at <hi>Rome,</hi> conformable to the grant. Many feared that when they were examined and approued, there remayning no doubt, the abuſe would bee confirmed; and therefore would haue had them prohibited abſolutely. Others ſayd they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes beene in the Church, and were neceſſary, and that all was in vſing them well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>igerius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sinigaglia,</hi> was of an opinion, which, if it had beene receiued and beleeued, would eaſily haue reformed the whole Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. Hee ſayd the <hi>Synode</hi> might remooue all inconueniences, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that a lawfull cauſe was neceſſary for a diſpenſation, and that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer doeth otherwiſe grant it, doeth ſinne, and cannot bee abſolued, but by reuoking it; and that hee who obtaineth it, is not ſecure in his conſcience, notwithſtanding the diſpenſation, and continueth in ſinne vntill hee quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Benefices ſo gotten. This opinion wanted not contradictors. For ſome ſtood vp and ſaid, that hee who granteth licence of <hi>Pluralitie,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a lawfull cauſe, doth ſinne, yet the diſpenſation is good, and the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is ſecure in his conſcience, though hee knew the vnlawfulneſſe of the cauſe. And the difference continued many dayes; theſe ſaying, that it was to take all authoritie from the Pope, and thoſe, that the Popes authoritie ſtretched not ſo farre, as to make that euill ſhould not bee euill. From this they went to another doubt, whether <hi>Pluralitie</hi> was forbid by the Law of <note place="margin">A doubt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by what law <hi>Plurality</hi> is forbid.</note> God, or of man. Thoſe who maintained reſidencie to be by the Law of God, ſayd that <hi>Pluralitie</hi> was forbid by the ſame Law, and therefore that the Pope could not diſpen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e: others ſaid it was forbid by the <hi>Canons</hi> onely. The <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates</hi> did hardly appeaſe the contradiction, and held it dangerous, as well for ſetting on foote the point of reſidencie, as becauſe it touched the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17208:137"/>
though hee was not named: and the rather, becauſe that ſubtill diſcuſſion of the force of them did put them all in hazard. There being much confuſion, <hi>Diego di Alano,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aſtorga,</hi> ſaid that in regard they could not agree about <hi>Diſpenſations,</hi> they ſhould prohibite <hi>Commendaes,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions,</hi> which are pretences to palliate the abuſe; and hee ſpake much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the one and the other. Hee ſayde that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions</hi> and <hi>Commendaes</hi> for terme of life were full of abſurdities, becauſe by them it was confeſſed, that regard was not had of the good of the Church, but of the perſon, that they were moſt ſcandalous to the world, inuented a little before, to ſatiate auarice and ambition, and that it was a great indignitie to maintaine an abuſe ſo pernicious, and notorious. But the Italian Biſhops, who were for the moſt part intereſted in one of theſe, did not willingly heare ſuch abſolute propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thinking fit ſome prouiſion ſhould be made againſt them, but not ſuch as ſhould take them quite away.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of February, the <hi>Topes</hi> anſwere and <hi>Bull</hi> came from <note place="margin">The Pope ſendeth a Ball to the Legats which diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them.</note> 
               <hi>Rome;</hi> which the <hi>Legates</hi> thought was too ample. But yet to make vſe of it, they propoſed the matter againe, cauſing the ſame determination to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by their adherents, that, in regard of the difficulties and varietie of opinions, it were good to free themſelues, and referre all to the Pope. The <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> euen thoſe who formerly ſeemed not auerſe, did now ſtrongly reply, and ſaid it was not honourable for the Councell. To which opinion the maior part inclined, returning to that which was ſaid before, and ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a greater confuſion: in ſo much that the Legates ſaw that they could not make vſe of the Bull, and wrote backe, that they were out of hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the whole reformation to his <hi>Holineſſe,</hi> nor more then that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto him, that is, the moderation of the <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> and <hi>Priuiledges,</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Cardinals:</hi> which if hee were reſolued to make, it were good to vſe preuention, and to publiſh a Bull in <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder the name of the <hi>Reformation</hi> of the <hi>Court.</hi> For no man could ſay that the Pope was not to reforme his owne Court, and that which belongeth to himſelfe. Neither was it neceſſary to publiſh this Bull in the Councell, which, if it did handle all other matters, would bee fully ſatisfied. And they aduertized his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, that the Synode would neuer bee quiet, vntill prouiſion were made, not onely againſt the future, but alſo againſt the preſent grants which are ſcandalous.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Congregation</hi> was ended, the Spaniſh Prelates, with their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, to the number of twentie, the Cardinall <hi>Pacceco</hi> beeing the chiefe, <note place="margin">The Spaniards doe deſire that the maner of proceeding in Councell ſhould bee changed.</note> did vniformely conclude, that, as the Congregations were caried, no firme reſolution could bee made.

But the Cardinall <hi>Pacceco</hi> ſaid, that all remedie would bee in vaine, if <hi>Commendaes</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions</hi> were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued, it beeing manifeſt, that a Cathedrall Church might bee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a Deacon, and hee that would haue a Pariſh Church without orders, may cauſe it to bee vnited to a ſimple benefice, which requireth them not, and ſo wil hold the one in conſequence of the other, without being conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The other <hi>Reformations</hi> were concerning diuers <hi>Exemptions</hi> from the <hi>Viſitations</hi> of Biſhops, from their examinations, from the hearing of ciuill cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and from the reuiſion of the gouernement of <hi>Hoſpitals.</hi> Herein the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats thought to gaine the fauour of the Biſhops, by enlarging their authority. But hee that pretendeth right to all, is commonly offended by the reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of halfe. So the Biſhops, (eſpecially the Spaniards) thought they were wronged, becauſe the <hi>Reformation</hi> was not compleate. Yet they ſpake more reſeruedly, in regard the number of the Italians, who adhered to the Legates, did increaſe, and becauſe they expected an anſwere concerning their propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions from <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing diſcouered that they were ſent thither.</p>
            <p>The Pope hauing receiued the aduiſe, wrote moſt effectuall, but, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, moſt louing letters to his <hi>Nuncio</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> to make the Prelates returne, who were almoſt all in that Citie. Who performed the buſineſſe in ſuch ſort, that all tooke the iourney for a fauour, in regard they were to doe his Holineſſe ſo great ſeruice. The Pope commanded the Deputies to conſult of the <hi>Spaniſh Cenſure;</hi> and the reſidue, which was of greater importance, together with other things, whereof he was aduertized before, he reſerued to his owne determination.</p>
            <p>The Deputies, weig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cious: that it was not wiſedome to ruune ſo great hazards, in matters of ſo great moment: and that to denie all, or to grant all, was equally dangerous. Their concluſion was, that if the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:17208:138"/>
were not more then certaine to ouercome, they might grant part of, or all the vnderwritten modifications, as occaſion was offered in handling of the buſineſſe: which were digeſted by way of anſwere to euery article of the <hi>Spaniſh Cenſure.</hi> To the firſt, to renue the <hi>Laterane</hi> Councel, in the two points, it ſeemeth that the Prelates may be ſatisfied, ſo that in the reſidue, the Canons that ſhall bee made be reaſonable. To the ſecond, to binde the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals to reſidencie, for thoſe who remaine in <hi>Rome,</hi> and actually ſerue the vniuerſall Church, it is not conuenient, and for the others, his <hi>Holineſſe</hi> will make prouiſion, as is ſaid in the letters. To the third, to conſtitute that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidencie is required by the word of God, firſt the Decree beeing applied to particular Churches, would perhaps not be true: then for the effect, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but make greater confuſion, there beeing a contradiction, that the Decree ſhould be made, and the contrary permitted, at the leaſt tacitely, for halfe of the yeere. To the fourth, to declare the plurality of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Churches to bee an abuſe, the ſame anſwere may bee made as vnto the third, and for the Cardinals, his Holineſſe will prouide, as hath beene ſayd before. To the fifth, of the plurality of the leſſer Churches, the prouiſion propoſed by the Legates, ſeemeth to bee ſufficient, and yet, if for the time paſt it bee thought fit, to make it more ſeuere, his Holineſſe is contented: who doeth aduertize them, that too much ſeueritie in this part, may worke a contrary effect, by the reſiſtance which is like to bee made, by thoſe who are in poſſeſſion: and doth conſider withall, that ſimply to leaue the iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the diſpenſations to the Ordinaries, may cauſe abuſe, and bring forth no other effect, then the increaſe of their authority. To the ſixth, to reuoke the <hi>Vnions</hi> for life, howſoeuer his Holineſſe thought to make a fit prouiſion therein, yet if it be deſired to take them all away, it may bee granted, ſo that a conuenient time bee giuen to the poſſeſſors, to diſpoſe of the <hi>Benefices.</hi> To the ſeuenth, that non-reſidencie in Benefices with <hi>Cure,</hi> ſhould preciſely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with it <hi>Depriuation,</hi> without any <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> to bee granted, but in caſes permitted by the law, is too rigorous, and would bee obſerued very hardly, in caſe it ſhould be determined. To the eight, that hee that hath a <hi>Benefice</hi> with <hi>Cure,</hi> if it bee found hee is vnlearned, or vicious, may bee depriued by the Ordinary, it being vnderſtood of ſuch inhability, as by the law doeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it, it may be granted; otherwiſe the demand is not honeſt, becauſe all would be left to the conſcience of the <hi>Ordinaries.</hi> To the ninth, that <hi>Benefices</hi> with <hi>Cure,</hi> be not giuen before diligent examination, in regard it is neceſſary to leaue the maner and quality thereof, to the conſcience of him who is to conferre the Benefices, it ſeemeth that to make any other Decree herein, is ſuperfluous or vnprofitable. To the tenth, to make the Proceſſe in <hi>partibus,</hi> concerning thoſe who are promoted to Cathedrall Churches, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth no fruit of this diligence, it beeing as eaſie to finde a falſe witneſſe in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus,</hi> as at <hi>Rome:</hi> where, becauſe euery thing may be ſufficiently examined, it is ſuperfluous to ſeeke further. To the eleuenth, that none bee ordayned but by his owne Biſhop, it ſeemeth that the <hi>Bull</hi> may ſuffice, becauſe it doeth prouide many wayes, againſt the inconueniences, pretended in this point.</p>

That they ſhould leaue wholy the Decree of the abuſes of the Sacraments, of Baptiſme and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, it beeing impoſſible to touch that ſtring, without offending the whole order of poore Prieſts and Friars, and giuing the Heretikes too great a conqueſt, by confeſſing they had formerly approoued ſuch notable abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.

               </note> friends, the aduiſes ſent vnto him from <hi>Trent,</hi> and from his <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> was full of ſuſpicion, that the Councell would produce ſome great monſter, to the preiudice of himſelfe, and the Papacio. Hee conſidered the factions amongſt the Diuines, eſpecially Dominicans and Franciſcans, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enemies, and contrary in doctrine, and feared that, taking courage in the Councell, they would goe beyond the bounds of thoſe contentions, which haue beene hardly compoſed by the wiſer ſort: whoſe differences beeing no leſſe then thoſe with the Lutherans, and themſelues very bold in taxing one another, except paines were alwayes taken to make them agree, there would bee danger of ſome great inconuenience. Hee was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the diſputation of <hi>Reſidencie,</hi> whether it bee required <hi>iure diuino,</hi> and with the boldneſſe of Friar <hi>Bartholomew Caranza,</hi> who, beeing encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by many, dared to call the contrary opinion, the doctrine of deuils. Hee ſaw how eaſily ſuch another miſchiefe as that of <hi>Luther</hi> might ariſe, and that, if an article of faith were made of reſidencie, the <hi>Papacy</hi> was reduced to nothing. Hee conſidered, that all the reformations aymed to reſtraine the Popes authority, and to enlarge the power of the Biſhops, and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle himſelfe was eſteemed, in that, the Councel hauing giuen hope to referre the <hi>Reformation</hi> to him, whereof hee had framed a Bull, and recalled the whole matter to <hi>Rome,</hi> they had after treated thereof more ſharpely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect of his authority. Hee had great ſuſpicion of the ſpirit and courage of the Spaniards, conſidering the qualities of that wiſe Nation; that it doth not worke by chance, that it maketh greater ſhew of reuerence then it beareth, that it ſtandeth vnited in itſelfe, &amp; ſteppeth not one foote for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, without looking a great way before them. It ſeemed to him a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they met together, and had made a common cenſure; and thought it probable that this webbe was ſecretly ſpun by the Emperour, in regard his Ambaſſadour did dayly treate with them. Hee ſuſpected the Emperour alſo for his preſent proſperitie, which ordinarily doeth make men not able to ſet boundes to their deſignes. Hee conſidered his conniuencie at religion, and thought it was to gaine the Lutherans fauour. Hee remembred the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints vſed not onely by the Emperour, but by his Miniſters alſo, when the Italian Souldiers departed, that hee was abandoned in time of neede; and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:17208:139"/>
hee knew that he attributed the ſedition of <hi>Genna</hi> to his ſonne, the Duke of <hi>Piacenza</hi> But hee weighed aboue all, his wordes vſed to the <hi>Nuneio,</hi> that hee had no greater enemie then the Pope. Hee feared that when he had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed an abſolute authoritie in <hi>Germanie,</hi> hee would thinke to doe the like in <hi>Italie,</hi> making vſe of the Councell to ſuppreſſe the Papacle. He ſaw that all was in his power, in regard of the incurable indiſpoſition of the French King, and his approching death. Of the Dolphin, being young, and not experienced, hee knew not what to promiſe himſelfe: and was aſſured that the Prelates, who did vntill then, adhere to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Emperor ſhould vnmaſke himſelfe, would profeſſe to be on his ſide, either for feare of greater power, or for emulation at the Popes greatneſſe: which they would diſcouer, when they ſhould ſee a ſecure way laid open to moderate it.</p>
            <p>Theſe reſpects made him reſolue to ſecure himſelfe in ſome ſort of the <note place="margin">And after conſul ation reſolueth to tranſlate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               </note> Councell. To end it, did not ſeeme ſeaſonable, in regard there did remaine ſo many things to be handled. The <hi>Suspenſson</hi> did require ſome great cauſe, and would be to litle purpoſe, in regard hee ſhould bee preſently deſired to take it away. To tranſlate it to a place where himſelfe had abſolute authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſeemed the beſt counſell. And ſeeing this was to be done, heo would ſo do it, as that all danger ſhould be preuented: which could not be, if the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, were not celebrated within his owne territories. He did not thinke <hi>Rome</hi> was fit, becauſe it would raiſe too much diſcourſe in <hi>Germanie. Bolonia</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the beſt place, becauſe it was neore the Mountaines, fertile, and of great receipt. For the manner, he reſolued to conceale his owne perſon, and to cauſe it to be done by the Legates, by the authoritie giuen them in the Bull; dated the 22. of February, and ſent vnto them in Auguſt. 1545. For doing ſo, if the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> were oppoſed, the Legats would be blamed, and himſelf, as not intereſſed, might the more eaſily vphold them: and if, by accident, hee ſhould change his opinion, he might doe it without diſhonour. Being thus reſolued, he ſent a priuate Gentleman of the family of the Cardinall of <hi>Monte</hi> with letters of credit, to doe this ambaſſage to hoth the Legate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Fathers gaue thankes to GOD, and went almoſt all to the Biſhop of <hi>Worcesten,</hi> congratulating that himſelfe and the kingdome were (as they ſayd) deliuered from the tyrannie of a cruell perſecutor, ſaying, it was a miracle that he had left a ſonne of but nine yeeres of age, that he might not be able to tread in his Fathers ſteps. And it is true that hee did not tread in them all. For <hi>Henry,</hi> though he had wholy taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Popes authoritie, and puniſhed his adherents capitally, yet hee did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer conſtantly retaine all the reſidue of the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But <hi>Edward</hi> (for ſo his ſonnes name was) gouerned by his Vncle on the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide, the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> who was inclined to the doctrine of the Proteſtants, changed religion, as ſhall be ſaid in its place.</p>
            <p>The Popes letters being come, the Cardinall <hi>Sancta Croce</hi> was of opinion, that it was good to mollifie the Prelates combined, by granting ſome of the petitions, which were granted from <hi>Rome,</hi> thinking, they would eaſily bee pacified with that determination. The Cardinall of <hi>Monte</hi> ſayd, that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to an inferior (eſpecially to a multitude) was to make them pretend a greater ſatisfaction; that firſt he would try his friends, &amp; when he found he was fortified with the greater number, hee would not retire an inch; but if he found it otherwiſe, hee would vſe art. After many diſcourſes, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth betweene Colleagues, <hi>Sancta Croce</hi> yeelded to <hi>Monte,</hi> who was more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate. They receiued aduiſe, that the abſent Prelates would bee returned before the end of February, whoſe minds were ſounded, and many of them were found to adhere to the Pope. Theſe being confirmed with hope, and others enſnared with the ſame baite, that the Pope would take notice of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">A decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 15. heads, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</note> ones merit, they cauſed the decree to be made, with fifteen heads, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it in Congregation.</p>
            <p>By this, greater difficulties were raiſed. In the Proheme, by this exception; Sauing alwaies the Apoſtolicall authoritie, in all things. Euery foole ſaw at what it aymed, and that it inferred a pertinacious obſtinacie, in the abuſes which they ought to remedie, by preſeruing their cauſes. Yet none durſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but the Biſhop of <hi>Badacoz,</hi> who ſaid, it had need of declaration, becauſe <note place="margin">And is there oppoſed.</note> the Councell ought not, nor could impeach the authoritie of any, much leſſe of the Apoſtolike Sea, acknowledged for <hi>Head</hi> of all the Catholiques. But it ſeemed that the words there placed did ſignifie, that in <hi>Rome</hi> the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhould be in thoſe things as before, and that the moderation ſhould not haue power ouer diſpenſations, and other inuentions, by which the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the old Canons hath beene alwayes weakened. In defence of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception it was ſaid, that the Lawes of Councels are not as the Lawes naturall,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:17208:140"/>
where equitie and rigour are the ſame thing, that they are ſubiect to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon defect of all Lawes, which by reaſon of their vniuerſalitie, ought to be moderated by equitie in caſes not foreſeene, when it would bee vniuſt to put them in execution. But becauſe there is not alwayesa Councell, to which recourſe may be had, nor it being poſſible to attend this, when there is one, the Popes authoritie is neceſſarie. It was replyed, that though all Lawes haue the defect of vniuerſalitie, yet all were publiſhed without exceptions, that ſo they ſhould now doe, or otherwiſe it were as much as to ſay, that ordinarily and not onely in rare caſes, and not foreſeene, the Pope might diſpence with the contrary.</p>
            <p>This opinion was not openly approoued by all, who in their conſcience <note place="margin">But the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

The Biſhop of <hi>Badacoz</hi> demaunded, that mention ſhould bee made in that Proheme, that the Article of reſidencie was not quite left off, but deferred onely. The Legates anſwered, that this was a diſtruſt of their promiſes, and a vaine Obligation to doe that which was alwayes in their power: Yet, to ſatiſfie ſo great a deſire, hee ſayd it ſhould bee added in the Proheme, that all was decreed in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the point of reſidencie, which they had begun; whereby it would appeare, that it was not ended in the other Seſſion, and that part did remaine to be handled.</p>
            <p>Concerning the <hi>Heads</hi> of the qualities of Biſhops and other Curates, the <note place="margin">Diſcourſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liues of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Curates:</note> Arch-biſhop <hi>Torre</hi> ſaide, that they did not onely remedie the corruptions brought in, but did weaken the ancient remedies.

Then the Benefices conferred by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, by reaſon of diuers reſeruations, being fewer then a tenth part, why ſhould prouiſion be made in this, and the abuſe ſuffered to run in the nine tenths, which the Court doth conferre?

            <p>The Articles were much diſputed on. The Spaniards did require, that the Cardinals ſhould bee ſpecified; but anſwere was made, that it was not <note place="margin">A diſpute whether the Cardinals ought to be ſpecified in the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> conuenient, in regard of the greatneſſe of the Order, being the chiefeſt in the Church, and repleniſhed with men of ſingular merit, to ſhew ſo plainely that there were corruptions in it, worthy of amendment, and that they did not amend themſelues. But it was ſufficient to doe it in generall termes, which ſhould include them alſo; as to command euery one, of what digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, degree, or preeminence ſoeuer. Others ſayd to the contrary, that the Canoniſts haue declared, that the Cardinals are not conteined vnder any generall termes, if they bee not expreſſed by name, and therefore that there was no other way to prouide againſt the bad example which the world ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, but to reforme them in particular. That there is ſmall need to reforme the inferiour Cleargie, whoſe corruptions are but ſmall, and themſelues, as it were, compelled to imitate the greater Prelates. That in curing a ſicke body, one ought to begin with the greater diſeaſes, and the more principall parts, which being healed, the others will heale of themſelues, or will neede but light medicines. For the abuſe of perpetuall <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions,</hi> they ſayd it was ſufficiently prouided, by referring to the Biſhops the examination of thoſe which are already made, and by preſuming them to bee ſurreptitious, which are not grounded vpon reaſonable cauſes. But all was ouerthrowen by the modification following, that is, if the Apoſtolique Sea ſhould not thinke otherwiſe: for this was to eſtabliſh them, and to put the Biſhop to trouble and charge. It was deſired againe, that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions</hi> for life ſhould bee prohibited, and thoſe nullified which are already made.</p>
            <p>But the maior part did approue the Decrees as they were propoſed, ſome for the good affection they bare to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome becauſe they had beene perſwaded, and ſome good men alſo, who were promiſed, that the Pope, by his Bull, would take away both theſe and many other diſorders: but that, for reputation of the holy Sea, hee ought to doe it himſelfe, and not ſeeme to be compelled to receiue lawes from the Synod, againſt his will.

                  </gap>athematiſmes</hi> beeing read ouer againe, ſome required that the doctrine ſhould be added, and ſome demanded why the Decree of the abuſes was not reſolued on. To theſe it was
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:17208:141"/>
ſaid, that the matter was not well diſcuſſed, and that it was more fit to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them after all the Sacraments, giuing remedie withall to the abuſes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring in the miniſtery of euery one, and to the generall abuſes of them all. In giuing a reaſon why the doctrine was omitted, the moſt concluding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument was, that ſo it was done in the Seſſion concerning originall ſinne, and that a doctrinall declaration is neceſſary, when the <hi>anathematiſmes</hi> cannot bee vnderſtood without it; therefore that it was neceſſary in the Decree of iuſtification; but in this of the Sacraments, the <hi>anathematiſmes</hi> be ſo plaine of themſelues, that they may ſerue alſo for doctrine. The approaching of the time, and the conſent of the maior part, made them reſolue for this opinion, and compelled them to be ſilent who demanded the doctrine, and the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the forenamed abuſes.</p>
            <p>The Decrees being made, though with theſe difficulties, and the third <note place="margin">The Seſſion, March the 3.</note> of March being come, and the Prelates, according to their vſuall order, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the Church, to celebrate the <hi>Seſsion, Iames Coccus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Corfu,</hi> ſaid Maſſe, <hi>Coriolanus Martiranus,</hi> Biſhop of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> was to make the Sermon, who for the diſtaſtes receiued in the Congregation, thinking he could not well bee preſent, and not perſiſt in the ſame opinion, in regard it was not ſecure to contradict in publike Seſſion, he made choiſe to faine ſome indiſpoſition, and ſo to bee abſent: by which meanes there was no Sermon that morning: as if amongſt ſixtie Biſhops, thirtie Friars, exerciſed in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, not one was able to ſpeake foure words with premeditation of foure houres. And it was noted in the Actes, that there was no Sermon, becauſe <note place="margin">A ieſting act concerning the Biſhop of S. <hi>Marke.</hi>
               </note> the Biſhop of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> deputed to, make it, was hoarſe, and ſo it was Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Which as it ought to bee attributed onely to the pleaſant vaine of the Secretary, who wrote it, ſo it is a ſure argument, that they did not then thinke the time would come, when all the actions of that Aſſembly, ſhould be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med equall to thoſe of the Apoſtles, when they met together, expecting the comming of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>When the Maſſe, and other ceremonies were ended, the two Decrees were read.</p>
            <p>The firſt concerning Faith, contained in ſubſtance. That for comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">The Decrees are read.</note> of the doctrine, defined in the former <hi>Seſsion</hi> it was meate to handle the Sacraments; and, the better to extirpate the hereſies, the Synode did for the preſent, conſtitute the Canons following, meaning to adde others afterward, when time ſhould ſerue.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Canons,</hi> or the <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> in generall, were thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene. <note place="margin">The Canons of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</note> 1. Againſt him that ſaith, that the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of the new Law, haue not beene all inſtituted by CHRIST, or that they are more or leſſe then ſeuen, or that any of them is not truely, and properly a Sacrament. 2. And that they differ not from thoſe of the old Law, but in the ceremonies and rites. 3. And that none of them is, in no reſpect, more worthy then another, 4. That they are not neceſſary to ſaluation, and that the grace of God, may bee gained by faith alone, without them, or without any purpoſe to receiue them. 5. That they are ordained onely to nouriſh faith. 6. That they doe not conteine in them the grace ſignified, or doe not giue it to him that doth not reſiſt, but are externall ſignes of iuſtice, and <hi>Characters</hi> of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:17208:142"/>
profeſſion, to diſcerne the faithfull from Infidels. 7. That grace is not alwayes giuen by the Sacraments, nor vnto all, for as much as belongeth to God, though they bee lawfully receiued. 8. That by Sacraments <hi>Grace</hi> is not giuen, in vertue of the adminiſtration of them; called, <hi>Opus operatum:</hi> but that it ſufficeth onely to beleeue the promiſe. 9. That in <hi>Baptiſme, Confirmation,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> no indeleble <hi>Character</hi> is imprinted in the ſoule, for which cauſe they can bee receiued but once. 10. That all Chriſtians haue power to adminiſter the <hi>Word</hi> and all the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> 11. That in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Sacraments, the miniſters intention, at the leaſt to doe what the Church doth, is not neceſſarie. 12. That the miniſter, who is in mortall ſinne, giueth not the true Sacrament, though he obſerue all things neceſſary. 13. That the vſuall rites, approued by the Church may be deſpiſed, or omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or changed for others, by euery Paſtour.</p>
            <p>Of Baptiſme there were fourteene <hi>Anathematiſmes.</hi> 1. Againſt him <note place="margin">The Canons of Baptiſme.</note> that ſaith the baptiſme of <hi>Iohn</hi> had the ſame vertue with that of Chriſt. 2. That true and naturall water is not neceſſarie to baptiſme. 3. That in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the <hi>Mother</hi> and <hi>Miſtris</hi> of all the Churches, there is not to bee found the true doctrine of baptiſme. 4. That <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> giuen by heretiques, <hi>in the name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost,</hi> with intention to doe what the Church doeth, is not true <hi>baptiſme.</hi> 5. That the <hi>baptiſme</hi> is free, that is, not neceſſary to ſaluation. 6. That the baptized cannot looſe Grace, though he ſinne, ſo that he leaue not to beleeue. 7. That the bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed are bound onely to beleeue, and not to obſerue the Law of CHRIST. 8. That they are not bound to obſerue the Lawes of the Church. 9. That by the memory of <hi>baptiſme,</hi> all vowes made afterwards are of no force, but derogate from faith, and baptiſmall profeſſion 10. That ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after baptiſme, by faith and memory thereof, are remitted, or made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall. 11. That baptiſme is to be renewed in him, who hath denied the faith. 12. That none ſhould bee baptized but in the age of CHRIST, or at the time of death. 13 Againſt him who putteth not children baptized in the number of the faithfull, or ſaith they muſt be rebaptized at the yeeres of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, or that it is better to omit their baptiſme vntill then. 14. That children baptized, when they come to age, ought to be required to ratifie the promiſe made in their name, and to bee left to their will if they refuſe, not compelling them to Chriſtian life, but by denying them other Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>Confirmation</hi> there were three <hi>Canons.</hi> 1. Againſt him that ſaith it is an <note place="margin">The Canons of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> idle ceremony, not a Sacrament properly, or that it was formerly vſed, that children might giue a publike account of their faith. 2. That to giue vertue to the <hi>Chriſme,</hi> is to wrong the <hi>holy Spirit.</hi> 3. That euery ſimple Prieſt is the ordinary miniſter of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> and not the Biſhop onely.</p>
            <p>After this, the decree of reformation was read, which, in the Actes bare <note place="margin">The decree of Reformation.</note> this title. A Canon concerning reſidencie. And it contained in ſubſtance; 1. That no Biſhop be created but of lawfull matrimonie of ripe yeeres, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and of good behauiour. 2. That none may haue or keepe more Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprickes then one, in <hi>Title, Commenda,</hi> or any other way, and whoſoeuer hath now more then one, ſhall chooſe one, and quit the reſt within ſixe moneths, if they be of the Popes free collation, or elſe within a yeere: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:17208:142"/>
all ſhalbe accounted void but the laſt. 3. That other benefices, eſpecially with Cure, be giuen to worthy perſons, able to take charge of ſoules: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ordinary Patron is to be puniſhed. 4. That hereafter whoſoeuer ſhal receiue many incompatible Benefices, by way of <hi>Vnion</hi> for life, perpetuall <hi>Commenda,</hi> or otherwiſe; or ſhall keepe thoſe that he hath receiued againſt the <hi>Canons,</hi> ſhall bee depriued of all. 5. That the diſpenſations of thoſe who haue many Benefices with Cure, or incompatible, ſhall bee ſhewed to the <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> making prouiſion afterwards for the cure of ſoules, and other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations. 6. That perpetuall <hi>Vnions,</hi> made within forty yeeres, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed by the <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> as delegates, and thoſe that are vniuſt ſhall be nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and thoſe that haue not beene in poſſeſſion, or ſhall be made hereafter, ſhall be preſumed to be ſurreptitious, if they be not made for reaſonable cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and with citation of all that be intereſted; and nothing to the contrary of this, ſhall be declared by the Apoſtolique Sea. 7. That Benefices with cure, vnited, ſhall bee viſited by the Ordinaries euery yeere, and ſhall haue Vicars a ſigned, perpetuall or temporall, with ſuch a portion of the fruits as to them ſhall ſeeme meete, without reſpect of Appeales or Exemptions. 8. That the Ordinaries ſhall euery yeere by the Apoſtolique authority, viſit the Churches exempted, prouiding for the care of ſoules, and other dueties, without reſpect of Appeale, Priuiledges, or Cuſtomes preſcribed. 9. That Biſhops ſhall be conſecrated within the time ſet downe by the Law, and all prolongations for more then ſixe moneths ſhall bee voyd. 10. That the <hi>Chapters</hi> of Churches, in vacancie of the Biſhopricke, ſhall not grant Dimiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for Orders, but to him that is obliged to take them, becauſe of a Bene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice. 11. That licences to bee promoted by any Biſhop ſhall bee voyd, if a lawfull cauſe be not expreſſed, for which they may not bee promoted by their owne Biſhop, and, in that caſe, they ſhall bee promoted by a Biſhop that reſideth in his Dioceſſe. 12. That Faculties not to receiue due Orders ſhall not ſerue for longer time then a yeere, but in caſes expreſſed in the law. 13. That men preſented to Benefices, by any Eccleſiaſticall perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, ſhall not be inſtituted before examination; made by the Ordinaries, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe who are preſented by Vniuerſities, Colledges, and generall Studies. 14. That in the cauſes of the exempted a certaine forme ſhall be obſerued, and where the queſtion is of reward, or concerning thoſe who ſue <hi>in forma, pauperis,</hi> the Exempted alſo, who haue a Iudge deputed, ſhall be conuented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ordinarie but thoſe who haue no Iudge deputed, ſhal bee conuented in all cauſes. 15. That the Biſhops ſhall take care of the Hoſpitals, that they be well gouerned by the adminiſtrators, though Exempted, obſeruing a certaine forme.</p>
            <p>The Prelats who oppoſed in the Congregations, did the ſame in the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <note place="margin">A modeſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is made, but not regarded by the Legats.</note> but with greater modeſty: deſiring that the degrees of the perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended might be expreſſed, and that beſides the prouiſions againſt future euils, remedies might be added for the preſent, which are more hurtfull, and dangerous. But the Legats, hearkening vnto thoſe words as vnto idle talke, concluded the Seſſion, and appointed the next for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </hi> The Card <hi>Santa Croce</hi> was confounded; but <hi>Monte,</hi> being without feare ſaid, that he euer knew the Pope to be a wiſe Prince, and that he then ſaw in him the height of iudgement, that it was neceſſary to do ſo, if they would preſerue the authority of the Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apoſtolike: and therefore that it was fit to ſerue his Holines with fidelity, ſecrecy, and diligence. And it hapned fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that many in the families of the Prelats were ſicke, either by the diſorders of the <hi>Carnoual,</hi> or becauſe the aire had been moiſt many daies before. <hi>Monte</hi> ſuborned ſome to aske the Phyſicians whether thoſe infirmities were not <note place="margin">The pretence for the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Phyſicians, who in their Prognoſtiques, alwayes ſay the worſt they can, becauſe if they proue true, they ſeeme learned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in hauing fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen them, if not, they ſeeme more learned in remedying or preuenting them, ſpake ſome ambiguous word, which was ſtudiouſly ſpread abroad, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by ſome of the meaner ſort Some others alſo were credulous of it, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe who were willing to depart, and therefore wiſhed it were true. And after the Seſſion, a Biſhop dying opportunely, interred with the obſequies of the whole Councel, made the matter more conſpicuous. Whereupon all <hi>Trent</hi> was full, that the diſeaſe was con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>agious, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſame was ſpread in all the bordering places. The Legats, to ſhew they had no finger in diſperſing this fame, held a generall congregation the next day after the Seſſion, to digeſt what ſhould be diſcuſſed concerning the Euchariſt, and, the weeke following, the Congregations of the Diuines did begin. But the fame being increaſed, <hi>Monte</hi> gaue order to <hi>Hercules Seuerolo,</hi> Proctor of the Councel, to make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces concerning the poſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent infirmity. The Phyſicians were examined<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronymus Fracaſtorius</hi> amongſt others, who had the title of the Phyſician of the Councel, and other perſons beſides. It was reported that the neighbor places would haue no more commerce with the City: which made many Prelats aske leaue to depart, either for feare, or for deſire to goe from thence by all meanes. <hi>Monte</hi> gaue leaue to ſome, that their departure might be alleadged as one of the cauſes; others, with whom he was more familiar, he perſwaded to tarry, indeed, not to want adherents when he ſhould propoſe the Tranſlation of the Councel, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſhew, that the councel might not diſſolue; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he wiſhed them to require in the Congregations, that ſome order might be taken. The Proces was proſecuted vntill the 8. day, when newes came, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or fained, that <hi>Verona</hi> would traffique no more with them: which troubled them all, becauſe they ſhould be as it were all in priſon.</p>
            <p>Therefore the, day a generall Congregation was held concerning this: in which the Proces was read, and a propoſition made, what remedy might be found that they might not be confined, with a diſeaſe in their houſes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of victuals and other neceſſaries.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:17208:143"/>
and to command the Prelats, vpon cenſures and puniſhments, not to proceed any further in <hi>Trent,</hi> but to continue it in the City, vnto which they ſhal tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it, &amp; to call thither the Prelats, &amp; other perſons of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> vpon paine of periury, &amp; other cenſures, ſet down in the letters of the conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp; that he will ratifie whatſoeuer they ſhall doe, any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary notwithſtanding. The Emperors Prelats anſwered immediatly, that the diſeaſe &amp; the dangers were not ſo great, that the timorous might haue leaue to go, vntill the opinion were paſt, which, by the help of God, would vaniſh quickly, and if the Seſſion were deferred, it was no matter: that many depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the yeere before, for the ſuſpicions of warre, and the Seſſion was deferred <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors miniſters doe diſcouer the plot.</note> more then 6. moneths, and that they might doe ſo now, if there were occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And other ſuch reaſons they brought. The diſputation concerning this was long. When the Congregation was ended, the Imperialiſts, conferring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues, and ſeeking curiouſly that which before they cared not to know, they ſmelt out that it was not a generall diſeaſe, but a pretence.</p>
            <p>The next day a Congregation was called to conſult vpon the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It was found, that 11. Prelats were already parted, &amp; they began to ſpeake of the place whither to goe. That it ſhould be in <hi>Germany,</hi> all did abhorre. It could not be in the State of any Prince, becauſe they had treated with none. There remained onely the State of the Church. The Legats propoſed <hi>Bolonia;</hi> which pleaſed all thoſe that approued the Tranſlation. The Imperialiſts did contradict, and ſome did almoſt proteſt: but the maior part conſented. Some doubted the Pope would take the Tranſlation ill, becauſe it was made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his knowledge. But <hi>Monte</hi> ſaid, that ſudden chances, and perils of life are free from theſe reſpects, and that hee would vndertake the Pope ſhould bee contented. Conſideration was had of the Emperour, and other Princes, and it was concluded, that if they made mention of them in the Decree, they gaue ſatisfaction to the reuerence which they did owe them: and to ſatisfie, in ſome ſort, thoſe, who approued not the tranſlation, they made ſome men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of returning. The Decree was propoſed by way of deliberation. Doth it pleaſe you to declare that this diſeaſe is manifeſt, in regard of the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other things alleadged ſo notoriouſly, that the Prelates cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in this Citie, without danger of their life, nor can be kept here againſt their will; and becauſe of the departure of many, and proteſtations of others, by whoſe departure the Councell would bee diſſolued; and for other cauſes alleadged by the Fathers, notoriouſly true and lawfull; Dothe it pleaſe you to declare, that, for the ſecurity of the Prelats liues, and proſecution of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, it ought to be transferred to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and is now transferred, and that the Seſſion intimated, for the 21. of April, ſhall be celebrated, and all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted there, vntill the Pope and Councell ſhall thinke fit to reduce it into this or ſome other place, by the aduiſe of the Emperour, the French King, and other Chriſtian Kings and Princes?</p>
            <p>The next day the Seſſion being held, and the Decree read, 35. Biſhops, and <note place="margin">A Seſſion is held to reade the Decree of the <hi>Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to <hi>Bolonia.</hi>

               <hi>Martelli,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Fieſole,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Viguerius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sintgaglia,</hi> whom the Cardinall of <hi>Monte</hi> did vpbraid, that his vncle beeing drawen from a baſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to the height of the <hi>Cardinality,</hi> from whence the greatneſſe of his houſe and his owne Biſhopricke did proceed, he did ill requite the Apoſtolike Sea. For anſwere he vſed the words of S. <hi>Paul, God is not mocked.</hi> The Legates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, with the <hi>Croſſe</hi> caried before them, accompanied with the Biſhops of their faction, with ceremonies and prayers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> were commanded by the <hi>Emperours Ambaſſadour,</hi> not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vntill his Maieſtie were informed, and gaue them order. In <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Court</hi> was glad they were deliuered from danger. For there was already great confuſion and ſale made by the poſſeſſors of many Benefices, who ſought to vnburthen themſelues, but ſo as that they would loſe no commoditie. The Pope ſaid, that hauing giuen his Legates power to tranſlate the Councell, and promiſed to ratifie what they ſhould determine, and cauſe it to be executed, and they hauing iudged the infection of the ayre to bee a lawfull cauſe, hee <note place="margin">Which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by the Pope.</note> could not chuſe but approoue it, and the rather, becauſe the maior part of the Prelates did conſent.</p>
            <p>But none was ſo ſimple, as not to beleeue that all was done by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, it being certaine that nothing, how little ſoeuer, was handled in the Councel, without order firſt had from <hi>Rome.</hi> For which purpoſe letters comming once euery weeke, and ſome weeks twice, it was not credible, that a matter of that importance, was hatched in the Legats braines. Beſides, onely to bring ſo many perſons into a Citie, ſo iealous as <hi>Bolonia,</hi> without conſent of the Prince thereof, ſeemed to be a thing which the Legats would neuer haue <note place="margin">The date of the <hi>Bull</hi> is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</note> attempted. Many did beleeue that the Bull had not a true date, but was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, though the date were old, and with the name of Cardinall <hi>Poole,</hi> to giue greater reputation: otherwiſe that clauſe, in which authoritie is giuen vnto two of them, the other being abſent, to tranſlate the Councell, would ſeeme a kinde of Prophecie, that <hi>Poole</hi> ſhould depart a yeere after; and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to tranſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that it was incredible that hee would, vnneceſſarily, expoſe himſelfe to the diſcretion of another, in a matter of ſo great weight. Yet, following the notes which I haue ſeene, as I haue ſaid before, I aſſure my ſelfe, that it was made two yeeres, and ſent 18. moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time.

For if the two Legats could command all the Prelats, at once, to part from <hi>Trent,</hi> and compell them by puniſhments, and cenſures, let any man ſay that can, what liberty they had?

            <p>The 21. of April being come, the day appointed for the Seſſion, with great concourſe of all the people of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and much ſolemnitie, the Legats, <note place="margin">The firſt Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in <hi>Bolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
               </note> accompanied with thirty foure Biſhops, went to the Councel houſe; where nothing was done, but a Decree read, which ſayd, that, it being reſolued in <hi>Trent</hi> to tranſlate the <hi>Synode</hi> to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and to celebrate the <hi>Seſsion</hi> that day, publiſhing Canons in matter of the Sacraments, and of reformation, yet conſidering, that many Prelates of the Councel, were imployed in their Churches, by reaſon of the holy dayes of <hi>Easter,</hi> hoping they will returne ere long, that all may be done with honour and grauity, the <hi>Synode</hi> hath defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the celebration of that Seſſion, vntill the ſecond of Iune, reſeruing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to themſelues to abreuiate the terme.

Theſe letters, beeing receiued in <hi>Trent,</hi> were thought not to be diſcreet, and did rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate then mollifie their mindes.

               <hi>Caeſar</hi> beeing made Lord of <hi>Germany</hi> by this victory, became Maſter of a great deale of Artilery, and drew much money from the Cities and Princes; and to giue a peaceable forme to what he had atchieued by warre, he orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Diet in <hi>Ausburg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things did much afflict the Pope, who conſidered that <hi>Italy</hi> was without helpe, and remained at the Emperors diſcretion. Yet he was comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <note place="margin">The Pope is afflicted in mind with the Emperors proſperity.</note> that hauing gotten the conqueſt by force, hee would bee compelled to maintaine it by the ſame meanes, and could not remoue his army from thence very ſoon. In the mean ſpace he had time to treat &amp; agree with the new French King, and the <hi>Italians,</hi> and to ſecure himſelfe. In all theſe troubles he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated, being deliuered from feare of the Councell. Hee commended aboue meaſure, the reſolution of the Cardinall <hi>Monte,</hi> to whom hee attributed this benefit. Hee reſolued to ſend into <hi>France, Ieronymus Boccaferrius,</hi> a <hi>Romane,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>At this time there was a great ſedition in <hi>Naples,</hi> becauſe the Viceroy D. <note place="margin">A great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Naples,</hi> by bringing in the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               <hi>Pedro di Toledo,</hi> deſired to bring the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> into the kingdome, according to the cuſtome of <hi>Spaine.</hi> The Napolitans reſiſted, and made a ſeditious crie throughout <hi>Naples, God ſaue the Emperour,</hi> and confound the <hi>Inquiſition:</hi> then, being aſſembled, they choſe a Magiſtrate to defend them ſaying, That when they yeelded their obedience to the Catholique King, they made an expreſſe capitulation, that cauſes of hereſie ſhould bee cenſured by ordinary Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Iudges, and that the particular office of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> ſhould not bee brought in For this cauſe the Spaniards and Napolitans did ſeditiouſly take Armes, and many were ſlaine, and there was danger of rebellion. When all things were ſet in order, fifty thouſand men beeing put in Armes, aſſembled by the ſound of Bels, the Spaniards being retired into the Caſtles, and the people fortified with Artillery, in conuenient places, there was, as it were, a formall warre, betweene the Citie and the Caſtles. The tumult laſted from the end of May, vntill the midſt of Iuly, and more then three hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were ſlaine on both ſides.

It was enough for the Pope to nouriſh the ſedition, which he did with much dexterity, hauing not forces to maintaine the enterpriſe. But the Cardinall <hi>Theatinus,</hi> Arch-biſhop of that Citie, promiſing them the adherence of all his kinred, who were many, and potent, and his owne paines alſo, who, to that purpoſe, would goe in perſon, did effectually exhort them not to let ſlip
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:17208:146"/>
an occaſion, ſo profitable for the ſeruice of the Church, gaining vnto it ſo great a kingdome. The Spaniards, calling ſuccours from diuers parts, became more potent, and letters came from the Emperour, that he was content there ſhould be no Inquiſition, and pardoned the Citie, except nineteene, all which he named but one, whom he would diſcouer when time ſerued: yet the City paid for a fine an hundred thouſand crownes. Theſe conditions were of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity receiued, and thoſe few of the nineteene who could be found, were put <note place="margin">But appeaſed by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> to death; and ſo the tumult was appeaſed.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Bolonia</hi> the Legats did not well know as yet what to doe; and the Pope <note place="margin">The Councel in <hi>Bolonia</hi> proceedeth ſlowly.</note> had commanded them not to proceed to any action, which might be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or make a diuiſion, but to goe on ſlowly, deferring the Seſſions, and making ſome Congregations, to ſhew they were not idle. But it was not eaſie to make them in a good forme, to diſcuſſe the point of the Euchariſt, in regard the principall Diuines, accuſtomed to handle matters of faith in <note place="margin">The reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is wholly forgotten.</note> 
               <hi>Trent,</hi> were wanting. Yet ſome Congregations were held, and diuers Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines did ſpeake, but no Decree was framed. There is no cauſe to ſpeake any more of the Reformation, becauſe it was then buried in deepe ſilence.</p>
            <p>The ſecond of Iuly being come, the Seſſion was celebrated with the ſame <note place="margin">The ſecond Seſſion is held and nothing done.</note> ceremonies; where they did nothing but prorogue it, with a decree like to that of the forme, ſhewing that the Synode had deferred it vntill that day, becauſe the Fathers were abſent and expected: whereupon, beeing deſirous to deale louingly with them, they added another Prorogation, vntill the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of September, not ceaſing in the meane ſpace to examine the points of doctrine and Reformation, reſeruing to themſelues power to abbreuiate or prolong that terme, though in a priuate Congregation.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France</hi> it was not hard for the Legate to obtaine of the King whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">A ſtrong alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is made betweene the Pope and the French King.</note> the Pope deſired. For hee alſo was no leſſe iealous of the Emperours for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and there was good intelligence betweene them, and very ſecret propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions did paſſe. Amongſt the publique, one was, that the King ſhould ſend to the Councell of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> as ſoone as might be, as many Prelats as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Marriage was contracted betweene <hi>Horatius Farneſe,</hi> the Popes Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, and <hi>Diana</hi> the Kings baſtard daughter, of the age of nine yeeres. The King ſent nine French Cardinals, to remaine in the Court, to giue the Pope reputation; and to nouriſh friendſhip betweene them. The Pope created <note place="margin">Two Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> Cardinals the ſixe and twentieth of Iuly, at the Kings inſtance, <hi>Charles di Guiſa,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Reins,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>

               </note> hauing about the Citie, the whole Armie of Spaniards and Italians, and ſome companies of foote within the Citie. It began the firſt of September, where the Emperor deſiring principally to pacific <hi>Germany,</hi> did impart what he had formerly done in diuers Diets, to reconcile it, and how, for this end, he had cauſed the Counſell to bee called, and to begin in <hi>Trent:</hi> but that his paines auailing nothing, hee was conſtrained to paſſe to another remedie. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it pleaſed God to giue a happy iſſue to his reſolution, reducing <hi>Germany</hi> to thoſe termes that he was aſſured to reforme it, hee had aſſembled the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for that end. But for that the difference of religion was cauſe of all thoſe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:17208:146"/>
troubles, it was neceſſary to begin there. The opinions of the Princes in that Diet were diuers; for amongſt the Electors the Eccleſiaſtiques deſired, and vrged, that the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould be held, and demanded no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The Seculars, adhering to the Lutherans, were content, with theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that it ſhould be free, pious, that the Pope ſhould not preſide, neither in perſon, nor by his Miniſters, ſhould releaſe the oath by which the Biſhops <note place="margin">In which the Princes differ in opinion.</note> are bound vnto him, that the Proteſtant diuines ſhould haue a deciding voice, and that the Decrees already made ſhould be reexamined. The other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes demanded that the Councell ſhould be continued, and the Proteſtants haue ſafe conduct to go thither, and ſpeake freely, and be inforced to obey the Decrees.</p>
            <p>While the Pope was in expectation of the ſucceſſe of the Diet in <hi>Germanie,</hi>

This afflicted the Pope aboue meaſure, not ſo much for the death of his ſonne, and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minie, as for the loſſe of the Citie, and becauſe hee ſaw plainely that all was done with the Emperours knowledge.</p>
            <p>But the Legats in <hi>Bolonia</hi> thought, that in this affliction and buſineſſe of the Pope, it was not fit to write two letters euery weeke, of what did paſſe in the Councell, as they were wont, and therefore that it was conuenient to prorogue the Seſſion for a long time, and to intermit all Actes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; which would bee done with honour enough, if the Seſſion, intimated for the fifteenth, were celebrated, and the next deferred. Yet the publique griefe for the Dukes death, requiring that no ſolemnity ſhould bee made, they deemed it was better to anticipate, and deferre it in a Congregation. Therefore the fourteenth, the Prelates being all called into the houſe, where the Cardinall of <hi>Monte</hi> was lodged, hee ſpake vnto them, thus in ſubſtance. <note place="margin">C. <hi>Monte</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a ſpeech to the Fathers in his owne lodging for prorogation of the Seſſion.</note> That the morrow was appointed for the Seſſion; but euery one ſaw in what ſtaits the Synode was; that not many Prelates are arriued, who are in their iourney, eſpecially the French-men, and thoſe who are lately come, are not well informed, yea, euen thoſe who haue been preſent the whole Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, at the diſputation of the leſſer Diuines, are not well in order: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto was to bee added the cruell murder of the Duke, which held euery one in ſuſpence, and themſelues buſied in prouiding for the ſecurity of the Cities belonging to the Church: that hee was glad hee had reſerued power to prorogue the Seſſion, that they may be freed from the paines of going to the Church to celebrate it: that his aduice was, yea, that it was neceſſary to make vſe of that reſeruation, prolonging the Seſſion now, and not celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to morrow. The prorogation pleaſed all the Fathers. the Cardinall added, that, hauing conſidered much of it, they were not able to ſet downe a certaine day whereon to reſt: that when they were in <hi>Trent,</hi> thinking to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatch the Decree of Iuſtification in fifteene dayes, they were faine to ſweate in the buſineſſe ſeuen moneths together, oftentimes making two Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions euery day: that where the queſtion is of faith, and confounding the heretikes, one ought to goe with leaden feete, and often to employ much time
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:17208:147"/>
in diſcuſſing a little word; that one cannot know whether it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to celebrate the Seſſion within few dayes, or not within many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths; therefore that his opinion was to prorogue it during pleaſure of the Councell; and that this reſolution was vndoubtedly the beſt. And if any ſay, that, the prefixed time beeing knowen, one might better diſpoſe of his buſineſſe, theſe may aſſure themſelues, that it will appeare within few dayes, what courſe and progreſſe the Synode is like to haue. All were content it ſhould be prorogued, during the Councels pleaſure, and ſo they had leaue to depart.</p>
            <p>The Prelats of <hi>Germany,</hi> aſſembled in the Diet the very ſame day, wrote <note place="margin">The Prelates aſſembled in the Diet write to the Pope to reſtore the Synode to <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> to the Pope, for ſo the Emperours pleaſure was, demanding that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ſhould be brought backe to <hi>Trent.</hi> In the letter was mixture of prayers and threats. It expounded the bad eſtate and danger of <hi>Germanie,</hi> againſt which prouiſion might haue been made, if the remedy of the Councell had been applyed in time, and held in <hi>Germany,</hi> as was deſired. For hauing am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple iuriſdictions, they could not long remaine in remote places, for which cauſe none went to <hi>Mantua,</hi> or <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and but few to <hi>Trent,</hi> a Citie which belongeth alſo rather to <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpecially in time of warre. Now, all things beeing in peace, they conceiued great hope, that the ſhippe was ſafe in the hauen, when, beyond all expectation, they vnderſtood the Councell, in which all their hope conſiſted, was tranſlated to another place, or rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided. Therefore beeing depriued of this remedy, there did nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, but to haue recourſe to the Apoſtolique Church, praying his Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for the ſafetie of <hi>Germany,</hi> to reſtore the Councell to <hi>Trent;</hi> which if he did, there was no ſeruice which hee might not promiſe himſelfe from them; and that otherwiſe they knew not whither to flee for ayde, againſt the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes and dangers that were imminent; that therefore hee would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to conſider of their demaund, and thinke that if hee made not prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was very poſſible they ſhould thinke of other courſes, to put an end to theſe difficulties: Praying his Holineſſe to take their Letter in good part, being compelled to write thus, by their owne duety, and by the condition of the times.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the Emperour vſed all diligence that all ſhould ſubmit to the <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror obtaineth of the Princes and <hi>Granuel</hi> of the Cities a conditionall ſubmiſſion to the Councell.</note> Councell, vrging, praying, and deſiring them to relie vpon his credit. His prayers to the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> were a kinde of threats, in regard of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer offence, lately pardoned. <hi>Maurice,</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> was neceſſarily to yeeld, becauſe of ſo great benefits, newly receiued from his Maieſtie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee deſired the enlargement of the <hi>Landgraue,</hi> his wiues father. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperor, hauing promiſed they ſhould haue due ſatisfaction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring them to truſt vnto him, they finally conſented, &amp; were followed by the Ambaſſadors of the Elector of <hi>Brandeburg,</hi> and by all the Princes. The Cities refuſed (becauſe they thought it very dangerous) to ſubmit themſelues indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently to all the Decrees of the Councell. <hi>Granuel</hi> did negotiate very much, and very long, with their Ambaſſadors, holding them obſtinate, in refuſing what the Princes had approued, adding ſome threats, to condemne them in a greater ſumme then they had already payd. Therefore they were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in fine, to condeſcend to <hi>Caeſars</hi> will, yet with caution of obſeruing the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:17208:147"/>
promiſes. Being called before the Emperour, and demanded if they would conforme themſelues to the reſolution of the Princes, they anſwered, they ſhould be too bold, if they went about to correct their anſwere, and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, gaue vp a writing, which conteined the conditions, with which they would receiue the Councell. This was taken, but not read, and they were commended, in the Emperours name, by his Chancellour, for that they had referred all to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as others had done, and relied vpon him: and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour himſelfe made ſhew to bee well pleaſed with it: ſo the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party was willing to be deceiued.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall <hi>Sfondrato</hi> fayled not of his duety, in propoſing many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages <note place="margin">The negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Card. <hi>Sfondrato,</hi> with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> to the Emperour, in caſe hee would conſent to the Councell in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia;</hi> he ſhewed him in what confuſions <hi>England</hi> was, beeing vnder a King who was a childe, whoſe gouernours were at variance, and people in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt one of another, becauſe of religion: he diſcouered vnto him the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence which the Pope held in that Kingdome, all which ſhould bee to his fauour, and that hee would aſſiſt him in that enterpriſe with men and ſhips, and would giue him leaue to make vſe of the Eccleſiaſticall rents of all his States. The Emperour knew the Popes aime was to intangle him in a new enterpriſe, and ſo to trouble him in that which hee had already brought to a concluſion. Therefore hee anſwered, that hee would bee vnited with the Pope in religion, but, in point of warre, was reſolute to proceede alone, and not to be his Captaine, who would abandon him in the beſt time of ſeruice, as he had done in the warre of <hi>Germanie.</hi> And, on the other ſide, he propoſed diuers aduantages to the Pope, in caſe hee would conſent to the returne of the Councell to <hi>Trent.</hi> The Legate hauing anſwered, he had no commiſſion herein, the Emperour ſent, indiligence, the Cardinall of <hi>Trent</hi> to the Pope, to negotiate the reſtitution of the Councell, and other particulars, which ſhall bee related. The Pope, hauing heard him often, and not beeing able to diſcouer his intention, did finally anſwere him, that hee ſhould ſpeake hereof in the Conſiſtery.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall hauing, the ninth of December, in preſence of the whole <note place="margin">And of the Cardinall of <hi>Trent</hi> with the Pope.</note> Colledge, declared what paines and dangers, the Emperour had vndergone, onely to maintaine the dignity of the Councelll and how finally, by this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and authority, hee had induced all the Princes and States of <hi>Germanie,</hi> to adhere, and ſubmit themſelues vnto it; hee prayed his Holineſſe, in the name of <hi>Caeſar, Ferdinand,</hi> and the whole Empire, that, for the loue of God, he would cauſe the Biſhops who were at <hi>Bolonia,</hi> to returne to <hi>Trent,</hi> to finiſh the neceſſary worke beginne, and would bee pleaſed to ſend one or two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates into <hi>Germany,</hi> with full Pontificall power, not keeping from them any <hi>Faculty,</hi> that the manner of liuing, vntill the Councell began, might be ſet downe by their aduice, and the Clergie reformed, that he would haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and determine, if the Sea were vacant, during the time of the Councell, whether the Fathers thereof, or Cardinals, ſhould elect the Pope, that, in caſe it ſhould happen, no new ſtirres might ariſe. This third <note place="margin">The Pope is put in mind of his old age.</note> point was added, to put the Pope in minde of his old age, and approaching death, and ſo to make him condeſcend more eaſily, that his poſterity might not inherite the diſpleaſure which the Emperour tooke at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Pope, in anſwere of theſe propoſitions, commended the Emperors good will, and his paines, for publique ſeruice of the Church, concluding hee would haue ſuch conſideration of theſe propoſitions, as they deſerued, and reſolue, as GOD would inſpire him. The Cardinall, hauing in diuers priuate audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, aſſayed in vaine to haue ſome good reſolution from the Pope, leauing the inſtruction to <hi>Don Diego di Mendoza,</hi> whom the Emperour had cauſed to <note place="margin">The Card of <hi>Trent</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, leauing <hi>Don Diego</hi> in his roome.</note> goe for that purpoſe to <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Siena,</hi> where he was to accommodate the differences of that Republique, hee departed, and returned to <hi>Ausburg. Don Diego,</hi> in publique Conſiſtory, aſſembled to giue the cap to the Cardinall of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> where all ſorts of men might be preſent, preſented himſelfe before the Pope, and expounded vnto him the ſame things, which the Cardinall had done; adding, that he had commiſſion, in caſe his Holineſſe did interpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny delay or excuſe, to proteſt that the Synode of <hi>Bolonia</hi> was not lawfull. The Pope anſwered, that he would firſt vnderſtand the opinion, and the reaſons <note place="margin">The popes anſwere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the returne of the Councell.</note> of the Fathers of the Councell of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and impart the propoſition to the Kings and Princes of Chriſtendome, that he might reſolue maturely, for the ſeruice of God, and ſatisfaction of all.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Guiſe</hi> made a publique diſcourſe in the ſame Conſiſtory, <note place="margin">The diſcourſe of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>Guiſe</hi> in the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</note> in the name of the French King, and ſpake thus in ſubſtance. That King <hi>Francis</hi> had neuer ſpared any coſt or danger, to maintaine the liberty of other Princes. In conformity whereof, <hi>Henry,</hi> not degenerating from the vertue of his anceſtors, ſo ſoone as he left to mourne for his Fathers death, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to declare his obſeruance towards the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> That the merits of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> towards the Pope, were famous, and exceeded all thoſe of other Nations: but this was aboue all which the King now doth, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all his forces to preſerue the Papall dignity, now when it is ſo contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. He prayed the Pope to receiue the King for his ſonne, and to promiſe to himſelfe all aſſiſtance from him, and to take care that the Church ſhould receiue no dammage or ſhame, in regard, that from ſmall beginnings, great factions haue riſen, which haue brought the Popes into great calamities. He exemplified in many Popes, afflicted, who were defended, and raiſed by the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> concluding that the preſent King will not yeeld to his ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, in preſeruing the dignity of the Apoſtolique Sea.</p>
            <p>Many did thinke that the Pope made <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſpeake ſo, to encourage the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals his dependants, and to daunt the lofty ſpirits of the Imperialiſts, and to make them ſee they could not enforce him. And to execute what he had ſaid to <hi>Don Diego,</hi> he wrote to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> to the Cardinall of <hi>Monte,</hi> the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition made vnto him, and his owne determination, giuing him order, that ſo ſoone as might be, inuocating the holy Ghoſt, hee ſhould deliuer all to the Fathers and when he had vnderſtood their opinion, ſhould write backe what the Councell thought. The Legate, the Fathers being aſſembled, declared <note place="margin">The manner how the ſpirit did worke in this Councel.</note> the Commiſſions, and gaue his owne voice firſt, which all the others follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For the ſpirit which was wont to mooue the Legates to thinke as the Pope did, and he Biſhops to beleeue as the Legates, did worke as formerly it had done. The voices being collected, the Cardinall, by the conſent and is the name of all, anſwered that the Synode, when the lawfull decree was made, to tranſlate it from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> hauing admoniſhed all to put
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:17208:148"/>
themſelues into the iourney, and, after that they were arriued in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that ſome remained in <hi>Trent,</hi> hauing againe louingly exhorted them to part from thence, and ioyne with the body of the Councell, they made none account thereof, continuing ſtill in that Citie, with contempt of the Councell, and ſcandall of many, as if they pretended to bee a lawfull Councell, or were not bonnd to obey this; and therefore that the Fathers <note place="margin">The anſwere ſent from <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of the Councell.</note> did not know how the returne to <hi>Trent</hi> could bee treated of, with the honour and reputation of the Synode, if thoſe who remaine there doe not firſt goe to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> to vnite with the reſt, and acknowledge the power of the Councell. When this is done, the returne, in contemplation of <hi>Germanie,</hi> may bee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, if that Nation will giue ſufficient ſecuritie to obey the Decrees, as well to be made, as made already. He added that there was a fame ſpread, that when the Councell returned to <hi>Trent,</hi> the proceeding ſhould bee popular, and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. Therefore the Fathers thought it neceſſary to haue good ſecuritie, that the order, continued in the celebration of Councels from the Apoſtles time; vntill this age, ſhould be obſerued; deſiring alſo caution, to ſtand ſecure, and to be able to depart, and tranſlate alſo the Councell, when it ſhall ſeeme fit to the maior part, and to end it when they ſhall iudge that they haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the end for which it was called; deſiring his Holineſſe not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell them to that which would bee againſt the honour of God, and libertie of the Church.</p>
            <p>The Pope hauing receiued theſe letters, when the Maſſe was ended on <note place="margin">Which the Pope doeth communicito to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; &amp; to the Emperours Ambaſſador.</note> Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſts day, beeing returned to the Chamber of the robes, with the Cardinals, did communicate the Councels anſwere vnto them: which beeing approoued by the maior part, he cauſed <hi>Mendoza</hi> to bee called, and related vnto him the opinion of the Synode, approoued alſo by the Cardinals, adding that there was nothing that he was not willing to doe for <hi>Germanies</hi> ſake: that the Emperour was a good witneſſe hereof; that he was ſure that the demand, which he the Ambaſſador had made, in the name of <hi>Caeſar, Ferdinand</hi> and the Empire had a condition annexed, that is, if it may bee with the peace and profit of other Nations, and liberty of the Church: which being aſſembled in a generall Councell, ſeeing it hath iudged otherwiſe, and that the Colledge of Cardinals was of the ſame opinion, he could not chooſe but repute it iuridicall, and reaſonable, and approoue it, as hee alſo did. That, for his fatherly affection, towards the Emperour, and the King, hee wiſhed hee could giue a more acceptable anſwere; but from a Pope, Head of the Church, nothing could be expected, but what the well gouerning of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like did compell him to reſolue: that hee knew the Emperours wiſedome, and his filiall loue, and was confident he would receiue this for good, which was thought neceſſary by ſo many Fathers, and would command the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Prelates in <hi>Trent,</hi> to goe preſently to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and labour to make <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> receiue the conditions propoſed by the Councell, and ſend, as ſoone as might bee, the Duch Prelates, and giue the Synode caution that the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions propoſed ſhould bee obſerued. <hi>Mendoza,</hi> vnderſtanding the Popes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution by his anſwere, would inſtantly haue proteſted, that the aſſembly of <note place="margin">Who would haue proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if he had not been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the Car. of <hi>Trent:</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Bolonia</hi> was not a lawfull Councell, and that his Holineſſe, if he brought it not backe to <hi>Trent,</hi> would bee cauſe of all the miſchances that ſhould happen
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:17208:149"/>
to Chriſtendom, &amp; that, he fayling, the Emperor, as Protector of the Church, <note place="margin">1548 PAVL 3. CHARLES 5. EDVVARD 6. HENRY 2.</note> would make prouiſion. But the Cardinall of <hi>Trani,</hi> Deane of the Colledge, and ſome other Cardinals, interpoſing, hee was content to relate the anſwere to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and expect order from him.</p>
            <p>The Pope, conſidering the action of <hi>Mendoza,</hi> thought that this buſineſſe might make ſome difference betweene him &amp; the Emperor, in which caſe he thought it not fit to haue the Prelates of <hi>Germanie</hi> ill affected to him. At the receiuing of their letter, whereof mention was made before, he was offended with the laſt particle, that they would thinke of other courſe, holding it to be a plaine threat, and reſolued to giue them no anſwere, and continued three moneths in that opinion: but now, better aduiſed, hee doubted, that, if they held themſelues to bee contemned, they would take ſome raſh reſolution, to which the Emperor would giue way, that hee might bee intangled in greater difficulties. Therefore beeing reſolued to preuent the danger, by honouring <note place="margin">The Pope writeth to the Prelates of <hi>Germanie</hi> in anſwere of their letter.</note> them with an anſwere, he made it very modeſt and artificiall, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conuenient ſence of his owne honour. The letter began with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of their pietie, which appeared in their care to remedie the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, and ſeditions, and that himſelfe was no leſſe ſollicitous, in regard of his paſtorall office, ſo that hee hath not ſuffered, nor doeth ſuffer any time to paſſe without thinking of ſome remedie, and had, from the beginning of his Popedome, recourſe vnto that which hath beene mentioned by them, that is, vnto the Councell. And heere relating what happened in the conuocation of it, and the impediments, why it came not preſently to execution, he added that, it being aſſembled, many Decrees haue beene made as well to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne a great number of the hereſies, as to reforme a great part of the Church; that the Councell parted from that Citie without his knowledge, but the Synode hauing power to doe it, hee preſuppoſeth the cauſe was lawfull, vntill the contrary doeth appeare: and that although ſome few haue diſſented, yet it cannot bee ſaid that the Councell is diuided. Hee added that it is not tranſlated into a Citie farre remote, and not ſafe, and that the being of it ſubiect to the Church, doth make it ſecure for <hi>Germanie,</hi> which hath receiued Chriſtian religion, and many other benefits from it. That hee cared not whether the Councell were celebrated there or elſewhere, and would not hinder the Fathers to chuſe another place, ſo they were not forced. But what did hold them from returning to <hi>Trent,</hi> they might ſee by the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> whereof hee ſent them a copie. That hee hath deferred to anſwere their letters, becauſe the Cardinall of <hi>Trent</hi> comming vnto him in <hi>Caeſars</hi> name, and afterwards <hi>Don Diego di Mendoza,</hi> hee was willing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the Emperour firſt. That, by the letters of the Fathers of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> they will ſee what is fit to doe before the returne bee reſolued on. Therefore hee prayed them to come or ſend Proctors to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and to aſſiſt in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. His concluſion was, that hee was not troubled with that point of their letters, where they intimate that new courſes ſhall bee taken, beeing con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſcious to himſelfe not to haue omitted any part of his duetie, and to haue imbraced <hi>Germanie</hi> with all charitie. That hee promiſed himſelfe from them and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that they would doe nothing without maturitie; but if courſes ſhall bee attempted againſt the authoritie of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> hee cannot
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:17208:149"/>
hinder it, CHRIST hauing foretold as much, when he founded it, yet hee feared not that their attempts would ſucceede, becauſe it was grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a moſt ſure rocke. That others had often-times endeuoured the like, but their plots were euer ouerthrowen: and that GOD gaue example in thoſe, what others, who would tread in the ſame ſteps, might hope for. And if the miſeries paſt, will not mooue thoſe that are preſent to deſiſt, yet hee is ſure they will remayne conſtant in their ancient pietie and faith, and in their Congregations will not giue place to counſels contrary to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Church.</p>

Finally, that he ſent the Cardinall of <hi>Trent</hi> to his Holineſſe, to ſignifie this vnto him, and to pray him to make the Councel returne to <hi>Trent.</hi> That he cauſed alſo <hi>Mendoza</hi> to goe to <hi>Rome</hi> to negotiate the ſame thing: and that the Pope hath taken time to treate with them in their aſſembly; who haue giuen a vaine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, captious, full of deceipt, worthy to bee condemned by the Pope, who notwithſtanding hath approoued it, calling the vnlawfull Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Bolonia</hi> by the name of a generall Councell, giuing them ſo great authoritie, that hee knoweth not how to arrogate ſo much to himſelfe. That it was certaine, that the Councell could not bee tranſlated, but by vrgent neceſſitie, diligent diſcuſſion, and conſent of all; that, for all this, they, who call themſelues Legates, and others, did raſhly runne out of <hi>Trent,</hi> fayning certaine Feuers, and infections of the ayre, and teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Doctours, which the euent hath ſhewed to bee cauſes not ſo much as of any vaine feare. That in caſe of any ſuch neceſſitie, it was fit to treate firſt with the Pope, and the Emperour, who is Gardian of Councels. But their haſte was ſo great that they did not ſo much as conſult with themſelues. That it was meete to heare and examine the contradictions and opinions of thoſe Fathers who did ſpeake for conſcience ſake; who, though not ſo many in number, ought to bee preferred, as more wiſe. That, in caſe it were fit to depart, they ought not to quit the Countrey, but, according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the holy Councels to chooſe another place in <hi>Germanie.</hi> That the choyſe of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> ſubiect to the Church, could no way bee defended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was certaine that the Germanes would not go thither; and that euery one might refuſe it, for many reaſons: which was to diſſolue the Councell, without warning. Therefore the Emperor, to whom it belongeth to defend the Church, and protect generall Councels, to compoſe the diſſentions of <hi>Germany,</hi> and alſo to reduce <hi>Spaine,</hi> and his other Kingdomes and States, to a true Chriſtian life, ſeeing that the vnreaſonable departure from <hi>Trent</hi> doth diſturbe his whole purpoſe, hee deſireth them, who call themſelues Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, with the other Biſhops, to returne to <hi>Trent,</hi> from whence they parted.
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:17208:150"/>
That they cannot refuſe this, becauſe they promiſed to doe it when the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of the peſtilence did ceaſe: which if they will doe, it will bee moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to all Chriſtendome. But if not, they, the Emperours Proctors, by ſpeciall mandate, doe proteſt that the Tranſlation or receſſe is vnlawfull, and void, together with all the things that doe, or will follow, and that the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of them, pretended Legats, and of the Biſhops there preſent, is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to giue a law to all Chriſtendom, in matter of Religion, and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of manners, eſpecially to thoſe Prouinces whoſe manners and lawes are not knowen vnto them. Likewiſe they proteſt that the anſwere of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is not good, but vnlawfull, full of deceipt, illuforie, and that all the dammages, tumults, ruines, waſtings of Countries which haue happened, doe, or may happen, ought not to be imputed to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but to that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which calleth themſelues a Councell, it being able moſt eaſily and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonically to giue remedie thereto.

In fine, they demanded a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique inſtrument of whatſoeuer was handled by them, and to haue the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours mandate, and their proteſtation inſerted in the acts of the pretended Congregation.</p>

This being as well knowen to them as to him, hee marueiled why, if the Tranſlation of the Councell ſeemed iuſt vnto them, they went not in company with the others; if vniuſt, why they made not their complaint to him. That it was a cleere caſe, whereof they could not bee ignorant, that they were bound to doe the one or the other; either of which, if it had beene embraced, would haue taken away all occaſion of ſcandal. That he could not chooſe but write to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with griefe; that they were defectuous in the one or the other, and that hee was ſooner aduiſed by the Emperour of their complaints, then by any of them, ſo much as by letter, or meſſenger: and that, for this negligence, he had more cauſe to complaine of the Cardinall, who was more obliged, by reaſon of his Cardinalitie. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which they ſhould haue done, was preuented by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who hath complained by his Ambaſſadour, that the Tranſlation is void and vnlawfull, he doth readily offer vnto them, that which ſhould not haue beene denied, if they had made the caſe kowen, that is, to heare their complaints, and take knowledge of the cauſe, And though he ought to preſuppoſe that the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation is lawfull, yet to doe the part of a iuſt iudge, hee willingly offereth to heare them and their reaſons, which they ſhall bring to the contrary: that herein hee would hold and eſteeme of the Spaniſh Nation, and of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not ſuffering the great preſumtions to preuaile, which ought to bee had againſt them. Therefore hauing by aduiſe of the Cardinals, called the cauſe of the Tranſlation of the Councell vnto him, and giuen commiſſion to ſome of them to relate it in Conſiſtory, all that pretend intereſt being ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Prelates of <hi>Bolonia</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> inhibited to attempt any thing, while the cauſe dependeth, as was contained in the writing, whereof he ſent

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, anſwered the Popes letter the three and twentieth of March, thus in ſubſtance. That they truſted in his benignitie and wiſedome, which will eaſily know that, in contracting the Tranſlation, in being ſilent, in remayning in that Citie, they thought of nothing leſſe, then of offending his Holineſſe; yea, that the principall cauſe, why they diſſented, was, becauſe a matter of ſo great weight was handled, without his knowledge: wherein alſo they deſired, that ſo ſmall account ſhould not be made of the Emperour. That it ſeemed cleere to them, that the Tranſlation would not bee well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, nor eaſily approoued by his Holineſſe, whom they prayed not to beleeue that the Emperour had preuented their complaint, exacted by his Beatitude, becauſe they had complained firſt to him, but that hee did it of his owne motion, who thought the protection of the Church belonged to him: that they ſhould neuer haue thought that his Holineſſe would haue deſired to haue beene aſſiſted by them, to whom they beleeued an abſolute account was giuen by his Legates, in regard what they ſpake was in publike, and written by Notaries; that it ſeemed enough for them to deliuer their opinion, and then to bee ſilent. Therefore they did not beleeue their preſence was neceſſarie in ought elſe. That if there bee any defect, yet their plaine meaning is cleare. That they thought it enough to diſſent from the Tranſlation, and for modeſtie and humilitie, not to trouble his Holineſſe, whom they ſuppoſed would not bee wanting, to performe what hee thought fit, for the good of the Church. That they ſaw not why they ſhould depart with the Legates, who promiſed, in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Congregation, and in the publike Seſſion, to returne to <hi>Trent,</hi> ſo ſoone as the ſuſpition of the ſickneſſe did ceaſe, eſpecially if <hi>Germany</hi> would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Councell. That they remained there, beleeuing they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, eſpecially when they vnderſtood, that, by the grace of God, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Emperour, <hi>Germanie</hi> did ſubmit it ſelfe. And that ſome haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſcandall by their abiding in <hi>Trent,</hi> as his holineſſe ſaith, it is ſufficient for them that they haue not giuen it; and on the other ſide, the departure of others hath troubled many. That the ſucceſſor of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath euer been very venerable to their nation; wherein themſelues haue not beene defectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. They pray his Holineſſe, that they may not bee blamed for what they haue done to a good end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and doe humbly beſeech him not to conſent they ſhould bee put into a ſuite, in regard the cauſe is not theirs, but Gods; ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if it were theirs, they would be content to indure any wrong; but being Gods, and CHRISTS, as it is, it belongeth more to none then to his
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17208:153"/>
               <hi>Vicar.</hi> In fine, they prayed his holineſſe to ſet the interrupted Councel on its feete againe, and cauſe the Legats and Fathers to returne to the ſame place, and to doe this by a Briefe, without treating of <hi>Tranſlation.</hi> They pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to take their words in good part, not ſpoken to ſignifie what the dutie of his Holineſſe was, but what they hoped from him.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards anſwere being receiued by the Pope, it was ſent to the <note place="margin">The reply of the Proctors of the Fathers of <hi>Bolonia</hi> the Spaniards anſwere.</note> Cardinals, to whom the cauſe was committed; by whom it was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the Proctors of thoſe of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> that they might proceede. Theſe anſwered, that they were glad that the Spaniards do acknowledge the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Iudge, and that they will not bee a partie. Yet it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to retort ſome things deliuered in their anſwere, to make the Trueth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. In that they ſay his Holineſſe ſhould firſt haue been aduiſed with, it was ſuperfluous, in regard a ſpeciall Bull was then read. That the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had been neglected, it cannot be ſayd, becauſe ſo great eſteeme hath been held of his Maieſtie, as of the Pope, the cauſe it ſelfe not compor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any delay, ſeeing it was neceſſary to diſſolue, or tranſlate the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, in regard of the progreſſe which the peſtilent ſickeneſſe made in the Citie, and borders, of the actuall and eminent departure of many Fathers, of the Doctors oath, eſpecially of <hi>Fracastorius,</hi> who had a publike ſtipend, and of the feare that the commerce of the neighbour Cities would bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. All which appeareth in the actes tranſported to <hi>Rome,</hi> by his Holineſſe commandement. That the Legates, after the Decree, exhorted them to goe to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> and being arriued there, did admoniſh them by letters, ſo that they cannot ſay they ought not to follow the Legats, becauſe they confen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not to the <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> for the ſuffrages of all in the Councell being free, they might diſſent with a ſafe conſcience: but the maior part hauing made a Decree, it was meete the leſſer part ſhould yeelde, or elſe, neuer any thing would be determined. That the returne hath beene promiſed is true; but it may bee ſeene in the Decree, in what forme the promiſe was made. If they taryed, beleeuing that the others would returne, why did they not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the Legats letters, who admoniſhed them to goe to <hi>Bolonia.</hi> But when they ſay the ſuſpicion of the Peſtilence was pretended, it is probable they ſpake it by chance; otherwiſe hauing nothing to ſay againſt the <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> and not ſending, according to the Popes Decree, they ſhould incurre the <hi>Cenſures.</hi> Neither is that diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought worth, if the cauſe be theirs, or of God. For as it belongeth to them, no man will doe them wrong, as vnto CHRIST, ſeeing the queſtion is of the fact, it is neceſſarie to cleere that which is not manifeſt in the fact. Whereupon the Emperour hauing calling the Legats pretended, and the Fathers of <hi>Bolonia</hi> not a Councell, but a priuate aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and vttered many opprobrious termes againſt the <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable the Pope ſhould aſſume the cauſe, not to cheriſh, but to appeaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. Whether ſcandals haue riſen by the <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> or by their remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in <hi>Trent,</hi> may be ſeene by this onely, that their remaining is the cauſe why the returne cannot be. And when they pray his Holineſſe to cauſe the interrupted Councell to returne, if they vnderſtand it of the vſuall Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, they haue neuer beene intermitted; if of the publication of the Decrees, this hath beene referred for their ſake: and ſo many things are
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:17208:153"/>
already diſcuſſed in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> as well of faith as reformation, that a long Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may bee made thereof. Therefore they pray his Holineſſe, to giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, conſidering that no Councell, but in time of ſchiſme, hath laſted ſo long as this, ſo that the Biſhops are deſired by their Churches, vnto which it is fit they ſhould bee reſtored. This writing was preſented in the ende of Aprill.</p>
            <p>After which there was no further proceeding in the cauſe, for that the deputed Cardinals knew not how to conclude. To pronounce the <hi>Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals deputed in this cauſe, knew not how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</note> lawfull, in the abſence of the contradictors, was to make a ſchiſme, hauing no meanes to enforce them to receiue the ſentence; and they ſaw leſſe meanes to force them to aſſiſt in the cauſe. The Pope was much troubled, ſeeing no way to compoſe the difficultie, without forme of iudgement.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were in queſtion, after the death of the Duke his ſonne, the Pope did continually demand the reſtitution of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and of other places, vſurped in the <hi>District of Parma,</hi> making vſe of the intereſts of the Emperours daughter, wife to Duke <hi>Octauius;</hi> ſonne of him that was dead. But the Emperour, purpoſing to ioyne that Citie to the Dukedome of <hi>Milan,</hi> and to recompence his ſonne in Law in ſomething elſe, delayed the time with diuers anſweres and offers, hoping that the Pope, beeing eighty yeeres of age; and grieued for his ſonnes death, and hauing many other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſts, would end all the controuerſies by his death. But the Pope ſeeing he <note place="margin">Differences betweene the Pope &amp; Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, about the reſtitution of <hi>Piacenza.</hi>
               </note> was deluded with delayes, moleſted with requeſts for the returne of the Councell to <hi>Trent,</hi> and offended by the remaining of the Spaniards in the Citie, to make a diuerſion at the leaſt, hee let the Emperour know, that the vſurpers of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> a Towne belonging to the Church, had incurred the Cenſures; to the declaration of which hee would proceed: fulminating alſo more of them, if within a certaine time prefixed, it were not reſtored to him. The Emperour wrote backe a ſharpe letter, aduiſing the Pope not to cheriſh the fugitiues of <hi>Naples;</hi> ſhewing that all the practiſes were knowen vnto him, and that hee did vnderſtand the calumnies raiſed againſt him, that he procured a ſchiſme, when he demanded a Councel in <hi>Trent,</hi> to vnite Chriſtendome; and for <hi>Piacenza,</hi> that it was a member of the Dutchie of <hi>Milan,</hi> many yeeres vniuſtly vſurped by the Popes: and if they haue title to it, let it bee ſhewed, and hee will not faile to doe iuſtice. The Pope ſeeing his ſpirituall weapons would doe no good, without the temporall, changed his opinion, and ſought to make a ſtrong League againſt the Emperour: wherein he found many difficulties, not being able to perſwade the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to enter into it, and the Frenchmen requiring the conſent of the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, in regard of the Popes decrepite age, and a pawne of money; which the Pope was not willing to lay downe, in regard of the great charge he was at, fearing it would be greater, for which cauſe, he had layd as great burthens <note place="margin">His Holineſſe endeauoureth to make a ſtrong league againſt the Emperor, but finding diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in it, knoweth not what to doe.</note> on his ſubiects as they were able to beare, and ſold and pawned as much as he could, and giuen order for granting of all ſorts of diſpenſations, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, to whomſoeuer would giue money, to ſupply the wants of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique Sea. For the Councel, he was moſt reſolute not to let it bee out of his owne Territories, and beſides other vrgent reaſons, that of his owne and the Popedomes reputation was added, that the Emperour ſhould not
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:17208:154"/>
compell him. But he knew not how to induce him and <hi>Germany,</hi> to giue conſent. To let it vaniſh, ſometimes ſeemed good vnto him, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not, and he often diſcourſed thereof with the Cardinals, both in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, and priuately. But finally, hee reſolued to put to hazard the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, for which hee knew he was inſufficient, not onely for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons before alleaged, but for other weightie reſpects, which paſſed in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> For <hi>Caeſar,</hi> at the returne of the Cardinall of <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Ausburg,</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Popes minde, and the anſwere hee gaue to <hi>Mendoza,</hi> at the end of December, (which cauſed him to giue ouer for the Proteſtation, as hath beene ſayd) and thinking that the Pope, by requiring the reſtitution of <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conza,</hi> ſought to diuert all ſpeech of the Councell, was aſſured, that, ſo long as he liued, either the returne would not be, or the reſolution would bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and therefore thought fit, before he diſarmed, to ſet <hi>Germany</hi> at peace, in matters of religion. Hereof a propoſition was made in the Diet, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der taken, <note place="margin">The Emperor reſolueth to ſettle a peace of religion in the Diet.</note> that choyſe ſhould be made of perſons, fit for this good worke.

But it had ſo many alterations, additions, and diminutions, that it appeared to be the worke of many men, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ends. Finally, it was reduced into that forme in which it now is; &amp; the Legate ſent a copie thereof vnto <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Emperours conſent, who was willing to vnderſtand the Popes opinion, and by the counſell of the maior part of the Prelates, who ſeeing the controuerſies betweene the Pope and the Emperour, feared that the Emperour would obey him no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; a thing much abhorred by them, for the inbred, and inueterate opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dutchmen, to maintaine the dignitie of the Pope, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counterpoiſe of the Emperours authoritie, whom without his aſſiſtance, they were not able to reſiſt; if, according to the vſe of ancient Chriſtian Princes, they would keepe them within their bounds, and remooue the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the renowned libertie of the Clergie.</p>

            <p>When the copie came to <hi>Rome,</hi> euery one was amazed; firſt in generall, that a temporall Prince, in a ſecular aſſembly, ſhould meddle with religion, and not in one Article onely, but in all. The learned called to minde the <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> and ſaid, that, vntill then, there were three names, vnluckie to the Church, bringing into it many diuiſions, vnder pretence of vnitie: to which might be added this fourth, the <hi>Interim</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth. They doubted that this beginning of the Emperour would end, where <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, King of <hi>England</hi> did arriue, to declare himſelfe Head of the Church: which would haue ſo much more compaſſe, as <hi>Spaine, Italy, Germany,</hi> and other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iacent Countreys were greater then one Iſland, which, in appearance, did make ſhew to containe one Catholike doctrine, but was very farre from it. Deſcending to particulars, they reprehended that, in the points of originall ſinne, iuſtification, the Sacraments, Baptiſme, and confirmation, the doctrine determined by the Councell was not ſet downe: and that collection being made to bee obſerued vntill the Councell, in regard the Councel, concerning thoſe points, was made already, what elſe could bee ſaid, but that it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely to be obſerued? But to haue publiſhed another doctrine, was to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate the Counſell, and that the Emperours cunning was more to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected then euer, ſeeing that hee made ſo earneſt a requeſt, that the Councell ſhould returne to <hi>Trent,</hi> and did at the ſame time, take away all authority from whatſoeuer was conſtituted by it. They condemned the whole body of that doctrine, for that it contained ambiguous ſpeeches, which ſuperficially conſidered, did receiue a good ſence, but, inwardly, were full of poyſon, that, in ſome parts, it did purpoſely ſtand onely vpon the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that the Lutherans might expound it for themſelues: but in the Article of concupiſcence, it ſpake iuſt as the Lutherans did; as alſo of iuſtification, placing it in the beliefe of the promiſes, and attributing too much, yea, all, to faith. In the Article of good workes, nothing was ſaid of the merit of condignitie, which is the principall point in that matter. In the Article of the Church that it hath not deriued vnity from the viſible Head, which is eſſentiall; and, which is worſe, hath made a Church inuiſible by charitie, and then made the ſame viſible. That it is a ſecret Artifice to deſtroy the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, and eſtabliſh the Lutheran opinion. That to haue made notes of the Church, ſoundneſſe of doctrine, and the lawfull vſe of the Sacraments, hath giuen a way to all ſects to hold, obſtinately, themſelues to bee the Church; concealing the true marke, which is the obedience to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> That the ſaying, that the Pope was appointed for remedie of Schiſme, and Biſhops by the Law of God, was not to be endured. That the Sacrament of Penance was made moſt Lutheran-like, in that it was ſayd, that beleeuing to receiue with this Sacrament that which CHRIST hath promiſed, it happeneth to euery one as hee beleeueth. That the principall point of Sacrifice, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, that it is expiatorie, and propitiatory for the liuing and the dead. That hauing granted wiues to Prieſts, and the Cup in the Communion of the Laitie, euery one might ſee, that with thoſe two abuſes the whole Catholike
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:17208:155"/>
faith was ouerthrowen. All the Court laid with one voice, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall point was in queſtion; that the foundations of the Church were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; that it was neceſſary to imploy all their forces, to excite all Princes, to ſend to the Biſhops of all nations, and; by all meanes, to reſiſt this begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, from whence would vndoubtedly follow, not the ruine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (for that was impoſſible) but a greater deformation, and diſhonour, then euer.</p>
            <p>But the old Pope, beeing moſt ſenſible, who, with the acuteneſſe of <note place="margin">Where the Pope differeth in opinion from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> his iudgement, ſaw more then them all, did immediatly penetrate to the bottome, and iudged that the enterpriſe would bee good for him, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious for the Emperour. He maruelled much at the wiſedome and counſell of ſo great a Prince; that, by one victory, hee ſhould thinke hee was made iudge of all mankinde, and preſuppoſe hee was able to conteſt with both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. That a Prince, adhering to one might oppreſſe another, but to contend with both, was too much boldneſſe of vanity. Hee foreſaw that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine would generally more diſpleaſe the Catholikes, then the Court and the Proteſtants moſt of all, and that it would be impugned by all, and defended by none: wherein there was no neede of his paines, becauſe his enemies would worke for him, more then himſelfe could doe; and that it was better to permit the publication of it, then to hinder it; and rather being in this ſtate in which it is, then when it is reformed, that it may more eaſily fall. Onely there was neede of three things. That the Emperour ſhould not know this. That he ſhould be put vpon the buſineſſe as ſoone as might be. And that the firſt blow ſhould be againſt the Proteſtants. To effect the firſt, it was fit to make a light oppoſition, in ſome things: for the ſecond, to ſet on foote the intereſts of the Germane Prelates: and for the third to make it cunningly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that this doctrine was collected, not to vnite both parties, but onely to curbe the Proteſtants; by which meanes a great point was gayned, that is, that a ſecular Prince did not make Articles of faith for the faithfull, but for thoſe that erred.</p>
            <p>Therefore hee ſent inſtructions to Cardinall <hi>Sfondrato,</hi> to make ſome <note place="margin">His inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
               </note> oppoſition, and, when the doctrine ſhould bee publiſhed (that hee might not be preſent) to take leaue and bee gone. The Cardinall, according to his Commiſſion, declared, in the Popes name, that the permiſſion to continue the receiuing of the Cup in the holy Communion, though he that receiueth it is not to bee reprehended, (the cuſtome of receiuing the Sacrament vnder both kindes being abrogated long ſince) was a thing reſerued to the Pope; as alſo the granting of marriage to Prieſts: and the rather, becauſe, it hath neuer been vſed in the Church: and the Greekes and Eaſterne people, who doe not binde them to a ſingle life, doe graunt that married men may receiue Orders, and keeping their wiues, may exerciſe the miniſtery, but doe not, nor euer did, permit them to marry, who were in Orders before. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that, without doubt, if his Maieſtie would graunt theſe things to bee lawfull, he ſhould grieuouſly offend the Maieſty of God: but holding them vnlawfull, hee might permit them to the heretikes, as a leſſer euill. It is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and belongeth to the wiſedome of a Prince, when all euils can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee remooued, to ſuffer the leaſt, that the greater may bee rooted out.
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:17208:155"/>
That his holineſſe peruſing the booke, ſaw it was onely a permiſſion to the Lutherans, that they may not without end, paſſe from one errour to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and that it is not granted to the Catholikes to beleeue or doe any thing, but according to the preſcript of the holy Apoſtolike Sea, which onely, as Miſtris of the faithfull, may make Decrees in point of Religion. And being aſſured that this was his Maieſties purpoſe, he told him it would be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make an expreſſe declaration therof, and not to giue the raines ſo much to the Lutheranes, eſpecially in the power of changing ceremonies, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that, in the laſt point, hee ſeemed to giue them too much liberty, where hee graunteth, that the Ceremonies, which may giue cauſe of Superſtition; ſhould be taken away. Hee added, that the Lutherans would hold it lawfull to retaine the Eccleſiaſticall goods, and iuriſdiction vſurped, if they were not commanded to make reſtitution: wherein a Councell was not to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but execution preſently made, and that, the ſpoyles being notoriouſly knowen, he neede not obſerue the nice points of Law, but proceed ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and with his Princely power.</p>
            <p>This cenſure was imparted by <hi>Caeſar</hi> to the Eccleſiaſticall Electors, who <note place="margin">The Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors approue the Popes ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of goods vſurped by the Proteſtants.</note> did approoue it; but, particularly, for the point of reſtitution of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call goods, they affirmed it was neceſſary, without which the worſhip of God could not bee reſtored, nor Religion preſerued, nor peace well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And that becauſe the ſpoile was manifeſt, iuſtice did require a ſhort proceeding. All the Biſhops were of the ſame opinion. The Secular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were ſilent for feare of offending the Emperour; and, by their example, the Ambaſſadors of the Cities ſpake but little, and of that little, little account <note place="margin">Wherefore the Emperor maketh a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heme to the Interim.</note> was made. In regard of the Legates remonſtrance, the Emperour cauſed a Proheme to bee made to the booke, to this purpoſe. That, ayming at the peace of <hi>Germanie,</hi> hee found it was impoſſible to make it, vntill the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Religion were compoſed, from whence all the diſſentions and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings haue riſen; and perceiuing that a generall Councell in <hi>Germany,</hi> was the onely remedy herein, hee had cauſed it to begin in <hi>Trent,</hi> and perſwaded all the States of the Empire to adhere, and ſubmit vnto it: but thinking not to leaue things in ſuſpence, and confuſion, vntill the Councell be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, a forme was preſented to him by ſome great, and zealous perſons, which, ſome learned hauing examined, by his appointment they haue found it not abhorring from the Catholike Religion, it beeing vnderſtood in a good ſence, except two Articles, the Communion of the Cup, and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Prieſts. Therefore hee requireth the States, who vntill then haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the Lawes of the vniuerſall Church, to perſeuere in them, and, as they haue promiſed, not to change any thing; and thoſe that haue innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either to returne to antiquity, or to conforme themſelues to that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, if, in any thing, they haue exceeded it, and to bee contented with it, not teaching, writing, or printing to the contrary, but expecting onely the declaration of the Councell. And becauſe, in the laſt point, leaue is giuen to take away ſuperſtitious Ceremonies, hee reſerueth the declaration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to himſelfe, and of all other difficulties that ſhould ariſe. The fifteenth of <note place="margin">With which the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are diſtaſted, though they accept it for feare.</note> May the Booke was read in the publike aſſembly.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:17208:156"/>
Emperour in the name of them all; who tooke the thankes for a generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and aſſent. No man ſpake then a word: but the Princes, who did long ſince follow the confeſſion of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> when they wereby them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, did ſay they could not accept it: and ſome of the Cities ſpake words which ſignified the ſame, though not openly, for feare of the Emperour. The booke was printed in Latine and Dutch, by order from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards tranſlated, and printed in Italian and French.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, the Emperour publiſhed, the fourteenth of Iune, a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The Emperor publiſheth a reformation of the Clegie conteining 23 heads.</note> of the Clergie, which had been maturely digeſted and collected by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and religious men. It conteined 23. points. Of ordination and election of Miniſters. Of the office of the Eccleſiaſticall Orders. Of the office of Deans and Canons. Of canonicall houres. Of Monaſteries. Of Schooles and Vniuerſities. Of Hoſpitals. Of the office of a Preacher. Of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Sacraments. Of the adminiſtration of Baptiſme.

Of Eccleſiaſticall Ceremonies. Of the diſcipline of the Clergie and people. Of plurality of Benefices. Of the diſcipline of the people. Of Viſitations. Of Councels. Of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. In theſe points were conteined about an hundred and thirtie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, ſo iuſt, and full of equity, that if one ſhould ſay, neuer any reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before was made more exact, and leſſe partiall, without cauils and traps to enſnare the vnaduiſed, hee could not eaſily bee reprooued, and if it had been made by the Prelates only, it would not haue diſpleaſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> except in two points, where it giueth authority to the Councell of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and in ſome other places, where it medleth with diſpenſations, and exemptions, and other things reſerued to the Pope. But beeing made by the Emperours authoritie, it ſeemed more vnſupportable then the <hi>Interim.</hi> For it is a fundamentall <note place="margin">Which being made by ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar authority, is iudged in <hi>Rome</hi> more vnſupportable then the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim.</hi>
               </note> maxime of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Seculars, of what degree or honeſtie ſoeuer, cannot giue a Law to the Clergie, though to a good end. But, becauſe they could not chooſe, they ſupported the tyranny (for ſo they ſayd) which they were not then able to reſiſt.</p>
            <p>A little after the Emperour gaue order, that the Dioceſan Synods ſhould <note place="margin">The Emperor giueth order for Dioceſan Synods.</note> be held at Saint <hi>Martins</hi> day, and the Prouinciall before Lent. And becauſe the prelates deſired that the Pope ſhould conſent, at the leaſt to thoſe points, which ſeemed not to diminiſh hisauthority, the Emperour offered them, by his hand-writing, dated the eighteenth of Iuly, to vſe all diligence to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his Holineſſe not to bee wanting in his duety. This reformation was printed in many Catholique places of <hi>Germany,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Milan,</hi> the ſame yeere, by <hi>Innocentius Ciconiaria.</hi> The Diet of <hi>Ausburg</hi> ended the laſt <note place="margin">Concludeth the Diet.</note> of Iune, and the Receſſe was publiſhed; in which the Emperour promiſed that the Councell ſhould be continued in <hi>Trent,</hi> and that hee would take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">And promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the Councel in <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> that it ſhould bee reaſſumed quickly; in which caſe hee commanded all the Eccleſiaſtiques to be preſent, and thoſe of the Auguſtan confeſſion to goe thither with his ſafe conduct, where all ſhould bee handled according to the word of God, and doctrine of the Fathers, and themſelues ſhould bee heard.</p>

the Church doth not erre in denying it to the Laitie, to grant it vnto them for life, or for ſo long as they ſhall thinke fit, ſo that it be done neither in the ſame time nor place with that which is done by decree of the Church. Hee granted them power alſo, to vnite Eccleſiaſticall Benefices to Studies, Schooles, or Hoſpitals; and to abſolue the vſurpers of Eccleſiaſticall mooue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goods, after the reſtitution of the immooueables, compounding alſo for the fruits vſurped and mooueables conſumed, with authoritie to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate theſe <hi>Faculties,</hi> to other perſons of note.</p>

               </note> ſhall bee related, and affoorded matter of diſcourſe. Firſt for the proheme; where the Pope ſaid, that, in the troubles of the Church, hee was comforted by the remedy left by CHRIST, that the Corne of the Church winnowed by Satan, ſhould bee preſerued by the faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> eſpecially after hee had applyed the remedy of the generall Councell, as if the Church had no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation but vpon him, and ſixty perſons of <hi>Trent.</hi> Then they thought it a great preſumption to reſtore Kings and Princes to honours, fame, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. There was alſo obſerued a contradiction, to abſolue from vnlawfull oathes, which need no abſolution, and from true oathes no man can abſolue. And it was thought another contradiction, to grant the <hi>Chalice</hi> onely to him, who beleeueth the Church doth not erre, in forbidding it to the La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tie. For how is it poſſible to beleeue ſo, and to deſire not to be comprehended in the prohibition? But they could not forbeare laughing, when they read the condition, to abſolue the Friars who forſooke their cloyſters, to weare the habite couered, as if the kingdome of GOD did conſiſt in a colour, or veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which being not worne in ſhew, yet it was neceſſary to haue it in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. But though the <hi>Nuncij</hi> were ſoone deputed, yet their diſpatch was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vntill the next yeere, becauſe the Emperour was not pleaſed with the manner of it, in which no mention was made to aſſiſt, or authorize the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions <note place="margin">Why the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of the two <hi>Nuncij</hi> was deferred.</note> made by him; neither would the Pope euer bee perſwaded that any miniſter of his ſhould be preſent.</p>
            <p>The Emperour beeing parted from <hi>Ausburg,</hi> vſed all diligence, that the <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors <hi>Interim</hi> doth pleaſe neither the Proteſtants nor the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques.</note> 
               <hi>Interim</hi> might bee receiued, by the Proteſtant Cities; but found reſiſtance and difficulty euery where, becauſe they did deteſt it more then the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques. They ſayd it was a totall eſtabliſhment of the Papacie. Aboue all, they found fault with the doctrine of Iuſtification, and that the communion of the Cup, and marriage of Prieſts was queſtioned. <hi>Iohn Fredericke</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> though priſoner, ſaid freely, that GOD and his conſcience, vnto which hee was bound aboue all, did not permit him to receiue it. Where it was admitted, diuers accidents, varieties, and confuſions did ſucceed, ſo that it was brought into ſome places diuerſly, with ſo many limitations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that one may ſay, it was rather reiected by all, then accepted by any. Neither did the Catholiques care to helpe forward the buſineſſe, becauſe they did not approoue it themſelues. That which did hinder the emperor moſt, was the modeſt liberty of a little weake Citie, which deſired him, that, being Lord of their goods and life, hee would ſuffer that their conſcience might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to GOD: that if the doctrine propoſed to them, were receiued by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, they ſhould haue a great example to follow. But if his Maieſtie would
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:17208:157"/>
compel them to accept of, and beleeue that which himſelfe thought not true, they knew not how it could be done. In September the Emperor went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to low <hi>Germany,</hi> where he found greater difficulties. For the Cities of <hi>Saxonie</hi> vſed many excuſes, and <hi>

Hauing giuen him many benefices, on the day aforeſaid, hee created him Cardinall, giuing ſubiect of diſcourſe, and Paſquins, to the Courtiers, who did ſtriue to ſhew the true cauſe of ſuch an vnuſuall action, by coniectures of diuers accidents paſt.</p>

               <hi>Charles,</hi> before he parted out of the Low Countreys, eſtabliſhed the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition there: whereat the Dutch and Engliſh Merchants, of whom there were many in thoſe parts, beeing much mooued, had recourſe to Queene <note place="margin">The Emperor eſtabliſheth the Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the low Countreys.</note> 
               <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Magiſtrates, deſiring a mitigation of the Edict, or, otherwiſe, proteſting they would depart. Thoſe who were to execute the Edict, and inſtitute the Inquiſition, found difficulty euery where; ſo that the Queene was enforced to goe to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who was in <hi>Ausburg,</hi> to celebrate the Diet, to perſwade him that the populous Countrey might not be made deſolate, and ſome notable ſedition ariſe. <hi>Caeſar</hi> yeelded very hardly; yet, in the end, hee was content to take away the name of Inquiſition, and to reuoke whatſoeuer <note place="margin">And reuoketh it as faare as concerneth ſtrangers.</note> in the Edict did concerne ſtrangers, all ſtanding firme which belonged to the Naturals of the place. The Emperour dealt with the Pope by his letters and Ambaſſadour, to reaſſume the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> deſiring a preciſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, <note place="margin">The Emperor requireth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope a preciſe anſwer concerning the Councell.</note> not ſuch as hee gaue to <hi>D' Auila,</hi> nor with ſuch ambiguity as he vſed to treat with Cardinall <hi>Pacceco,</hi> but that hee would let him know the Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which hee required, that hee might reſolue whether that medicine would cure the maladies of <hi>Germanie,</hi> or ſhould thinke of other remedies, it being impoſſible to continue longer in that State.</p>
            <p>The Pope, conſidering with his inward friends, that this was the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant deliberation which could happen in all his Papacie, did ballance <note place="margin">And the Pope doth ſeriouſly deliberate what anſwer to make.</note> the reaſons which might perſwade or diſſwade it. Firſt he conſidered, that, remitting the Councell to <hi>Trent,</hi> hee condemned the Tranſlation to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> which was principally his deede, and ſo ſhould plainly confeſſe hee had done amiſſe, either willingly, or at the inſtance of another. And if there had beene nothing but the Tranſlation, it had not beene a matter of ſo great weight. But hauing made himſelfe a party to defend it, and ſo earneſtly, hee could not excuſe himſelfe of malice, if hee did ſo eaſily retract it. And, which imported moſt, he ſhould put himſelfe into all thoſe dangers, from which <hi>Paul,</hi> a moſt wiſe Prince, thought fit to ſecure himſelfe, &amp; perſeuered in that opinion vntil his death: and that it was a manifeſt error to reenter into them. And though many were not ill affected to him, being a new Pope, yet it is certaine that the maior part doe not pretend to bee greued at the Pope, but at the Popedome: and, for this particular, no man can bee ſure, that ſomething may not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the progreſſe, which may raiſe him greater hatred, though without his fault. Beſides, all men are not mooued with hatred, but thoſe that hurt moſt, deſire to aduantage themſelues by depreſſing others, Therefore it may be concluded that the ſame reaſons, which mooued <hi>Paul,</hi> would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine <hi>Iulius</hi> alſo to the ſame reſolution. He conſidered the great troubles that <hi>Paul</hi> ſuſtained 26. moneths, for this cauſe, and the indignities which hee did neceſſarily ſuffer, and the diminution of the Papall authority, not onely in <hi>Germany,</hi> but in <hi>Italy</hi> alſo. And if this did derogate from <hi>Paul,</hi> confirmed ſo many yeeres in the Papacie, and eſteemed by all, it would doe it from him much more, being a new Pope, not hauing as yet made intelligences, and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:17208:160"/>
adherences, neceſſary for the enterpriſe of conteſting, and if a proteſtation ſhould hee layde on his backe, or a Decree, as the <hi>Interim,</hi> his authoritie would bee ſcorned by all. Hee was not to reckon of the paines in tranſlating the Councell, and his conſtancie in defending it, becauſe with the change of fortune, whatſoeuer dependeth on it is changed, and the actions of <hi>Iohn Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria di Monte,</hi> doe not appertaine to Pope <hi>Iulius,</hi> and thoſe things which gaue reputation vnto that man, doe not giue it vnto this. Then it was fit to doe as he did, to ſhew himſelfe a faithfull ſeruant of his Lord; but now, beeing Lord himſelfe, the reſpect of conſtancie in ſeruing well doeth quite ceaſe, and another doeth ſucceede, which requireth wiſedome, in applying himſelfe to the times. Hee conſidered how popular the Emperours requeſt was, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the reducing of <hi>Germanie</hi> was in queſtion, and how ſcandalous it would bee not to hearken vnto it. The cauſes which mooued to make the Councell were plaine and manifeſt to all; thoſe which diſſwaded were ſecret, &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to few. Finally the Oath made, and iterated, ought to be regarded, which though it did binde to proſecute the Councell, without preſcribing the place, yet it was certaine, that, without the Emperours conſent, being king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> Prince of the low Countries, and hauing other adherences in <hi>Italie,</hi> it was impoſſible to make a generall Councell; ſo that, to refuſe to bring it backe to <hi>Trent,</hi> and not to proſecute it, was all one. He inclined to this part moſt, as moſt agreeable to his diſpoſition, deſirous rather to flye preſent incommodities, then auoyd future dangers. For chooſing to celebrate the Councell, hee was deliuered from the trouble which the Emperour would giue him; and for the dangers which it brought, hee began to eſteeme them leſſe. Hee thought the Emperours fortune was not then the ſame as it was two yeeres before. For at that time the expectation of the victorie, which hee after obtained, gaue him reputation; which now ſeemeth rather to bee burdenſome to him, then any eaſe. Hee holdeth two Princes priſoners, as wolues by the eares. The Cities of <hi>Germanie</hi> doe openly inchne to rebellion. The Eccleſiaſtikes haue a ſatietie of that domination. There are alſo domeſticall croſſes, in regard of his ſonne, brother, and nephew, who aſpire to the Empire; a buſineſſe, which perhaps may giue him trouble, beyond his forces. In fine, he concluded, according to his diſpoſition, Let vs get out of the preſent difficultie, with hope that our good fortune will not abandon vs.</p>
            <p>And concealing his reſolution, hee deputed a Congregation of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, <note place="margin">He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealeth his reſolution vntill it bee confirmed by a congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</note> and other Prelats, for the moſt part Imperialiſts, that they might fall vpon the reſolution which hee had taken, mingling ſome few of his truſtie friends amongſt them, to gouerne the buſineſſe according to his purpoſe. To theſe he propoſed the Emperours requeſt; giuing order that without all reſpect, euery one ſhould ſpeake what he thought conuenient for the ſeruice of GOD, and the Apoſtolike Sea. And in caſe they thought fit to condeſcend, they ſhould thinke how to doe it with honour, ſecuritie, and fruit. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, hauing often conſulted, related to the Pope, that they were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the Councel ſhould bee proſecuted, becauſe ſuch an Oath was taken in the Conclaue, and by his Holineſſe, after his aſſumption, and to take away ſcandall from the world, which without doubt would be very great, incaſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

were not done. And it might be proſecuted two wayes; one by continuing it in <hi>Bolonid,</hi> another by remitting it to <hi>Trent.</hi> It could not bee continued in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> had called to him the cauſe of the Tranſlation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to proceede any further. If his Holineſſe did not firſt giue ſentence that the Tranſlation was good, it was not lawfull to goe on in that City: and if hee did, he would giue a lawfull pretence to bee ſuſpected, it being knowen that the Tranſlation was made by him, as being the prime Legate, and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Therefore onely the other way remayned, to remit it to <hi>Trent,</hi> and all occaſion was ſo taken away from <hi>Germanie</hi> to ſpurne againſt it, and the Emperour was ſatisfied, which was a very eſſentiall poynt. This aduice, being brought to the Pope, was approued by him: and ſo they paſſed to that which remained.</p>
            <p>And firſt it was concluded, that the conſent and aſſiſtance of the French <note place="margin">The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to <hi>Trent</hi> are debated.</note> King was neceſſary, and the preſence of the Prelates of his Kingdome, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the reputation of the Councell would bee very weake, and they ſhould bee in danger to looſe <hi>France,</hi> onely to indeuour to regaine <hi>Germanie,</hi> which is loſt: which were, according to the fable, to let the body fall, to get the ſhadow. It ſeemed hard to perſwade that King, and to take from him all ſuſpition, if the Councel were celebrated in a place ſubiect vnto the Emperour, and neere vnto his armie. But examining what thoſe ſuſpitions might bee, they could finde none, but that the Councel might determine ſomething, in preiudice of the gouernment of that Kingdom, or againſt the priuiledges of that Crowne, or againſt the libertie of the French Church: in which, if hee were ſecure, it could not bee doubted but that, for the hereditarie obligation to protect and fauour the Apoſtolike Sea, he would aſſiſt, and ſend his Prelates. The ſecond difficultie was, that the Italian Prelates, beeing poore, could not beare the charge of that place, and the Apoſtolike Chamber, being exhauſted, could ill ſupply as much as was needefull, beſides the charge of maintaining the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, and Officers of the Councel, and other extraordinaries. Whereof thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king often, they could finde no way to hold the Councell without expence, and that it was neceſſary to drinke of this Cup: but ſuperfluities might well bee cut off, by diſpatching the Councell quickely, and not tarying there longer then was neceſſary. The third difficultie was, that the Proteſtants would call into queſtion the things determined; wherein all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation reſolued readily, that they ſhould make their meaning plaine, that they ought to be eſteemed as infallible, and not ſuffer them to be diſputed on: and to declare this before the Councel, not deferring to make them ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood vntill then.</p>
            <p>The fourth and moſt important difficultie of all, was the authoritie of the <note place="margin">Of which the greateſt is the danger of the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> Apoſtolike Sea, as well in the Councell, as out of it, and ouer it; which not the Proteſtants onely doe impugne, but many Princes alſo would reſtraine, and many Biſhops did thinke to moderate. This was the chiefe cauſe why the former Popes would not bee perſwaded to call a Councell; and <hi>Paul</hi> who was brought to it, did perceiue it in the end, and prouided againſt it, by the Tranſlation. This danger was ſeene by all; but none could ſet downe a way to eſcape it, but by ſaying, that God who had founded the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, and placed it aboue others, would diſſipate all counſell
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:17208:161"/>
taken againſt it. This, ſome beleeuing for ſimplicitie, ſome for their intereſt, ſome becauſe they knew not what elſe to ſay, ſeemed not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
            <p>But Cardinall <hi>Creſcentius,</hi> grounding himſelfe much vpon this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſayd, that there was no humane action in which there was not ſome danger; that the warre did ſhew as much, which is the chiefeſt, which is neuer enterpriſed, though with neuer ſo much aſſurance of victorie, but there is danger of loſſe and totall deſtruction; neither is there any buſineſſe <note place="margin">The feare whereof Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Creſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> remoueth</note> vndertaken, with ſo much certainety of a good iſſue, which may not ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fall into great inconueniences, for vnknowen, or lightly eſteemed, cauſes. But hee that is forced, for auoyding other euils, to yeelde to ſome reſolution, muſt not care for it. Things are in ſuch a ſtate, that, if the Councell bee not held, there is more danger that the world, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, beeing ſcandalized, will aliene themſelues from the Pope, and doe more <hi>de facto,</hi> then, in the Councell, by diſputations and Decrees. Danger is to bee incurred either way, and it is beſt to take the moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and leaſt dangerous part. But many prouiſions may bee made to diuert it; as to keepe the Fathers of the Councell buſied, as much as may bee, in other matters, and ſo to hold them in exerciſe, that they may not haue time to thinke of this; to keepe many in amitie, eſpecially the Italians, with perſwaſions and hopes, and by other meanes vſed heretofore, to hold the Princes counterpoyſed, nouriſhing ſome differences of intereſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, that they may not ioyntly vndertake ſuch an enterpriſe; and, if one doe it alone, the others will oppoſe it: and a wiſe man will finde other remedies in the very fact, by which hee will bee able to carrie matters along, and make them vaniſh. This opinion was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued, and a reſolution taken, that no demonſtration of feare ſhould bee made, but onely that it ſhould bee intimated to the Emperour, that this is foreſeene, but that no man careth for it, becauſe there is a remedie prepared.</p>
            <p>This conſultation beeing maturely made, and a reſolution taken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore <note place="margin">The Pope ſendeth <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cij</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and French King, to giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his reſolution.</note> the Councell in <hi>Trent,</hi> the Pope gaue an account thereof to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and the French Ambaſſadour, and diſpatched an expreſſe currier to the French King, to ſignifie his purpoſe vnto him, ſaying hee would ſend a <hi>Nuncio</hi> vnto him, to relate more particularly the reaſons which moued him. And, in the end of Iune, hee diſpatched two <hi>Nuncij</hi> at once, <hi>Sebaſtianus Pighinus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Siponto,</hi> to the Emperour, and <hi>Triulcius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tolone,</hi> to the French King.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:17208:162"/>
ground was the aſſiſtance of his moſt Chriſtian Maieſtie, and the preſence of the Prelates of his Kingdome: which hee hoped to obtaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Maieſtie was protector of the faith, and an imitator of his ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours, who neuer departed from the opinion and counſels of Popes. That in the Councell they would applie themſelues to the declaration and purifying of the poynts of doctrine, and reformation of manners: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould any thing concerning the States, Dominions, and particular priuiledges of the Crowne of <hi>France</hi> bee handled. That to the Emperours requeſt, to vnderſtand, whether the Pope would proſecute the Councell in <hi>Trent,</hi> or not, the Pope had anſwered he would, with the conditions diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed in the Congregation, all which hee gaue order to his <hi>Nuncio</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the King; whoſe minde hee deſired to knowe, as ſoone as might bee, hoping to finde it conformable to the pietie of his Maieſtie, to the loue which hee beareth to him the Pope, and to the confidence which hee hath in him. Hee alſo charged the <hi>Nuncio</hi> to communicate all his inſtructions to the Cardinall of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and, with him, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as hee thought beſt, to declare it to the King, and to whom elſe hee thought fit.</p>

And, to anſwere the Emperours motion, to make knowen the capitulations which hee required, hee ſhould tell him, that hee neuer dreamed to make any bargaines or capitulations, for proſecuting the Councell, but onely ſome neceſſary conſiderations, which hee charged his <hi>Nuncio</hi> to expound to his Maieſtie. And they were foure. The firſt, that the aſſiſtance of the moſt Chriſtian King, and the interuention of the Prelates of his Kingdome, was neceſſary, without which the Councell would haue but ſmall reputation, and it might bee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that a Nationall Councel would ariſe, or <hi>France</hi> be loſt. That they ought <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oure conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Pope to the Emperour.</note> not to deceiue themſelues. For as <hi>Trent</hi> was a ſecure place for his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Maieſtie, ſo it was too vnſecure for the moſt Chriſtian King: and therefore that it was fit to finde a way to ſecure him. That hee ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the Emperor the way which he had found out, which if it were not ſufficient, it would be neceſſary that his Maieſtie ſhould adde ſome thing elſe. The ſecond conſideration was, the expences which the Apoſtolike <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> exhauſted, and charged with debts, was to make, for the Legats, and other extraordinaries, which the Councell bringeth with it, and like wiſe for the expences which the poore <hi>Italian</hi> Prelates cannot beare in that place. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it will bee fit to calculate the time well, aſwell for the proceeding, as the beginning, that an houre may not bee ſpent in vaine, otherwiſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike Sea will not bee able to beare the charge, nor to keepe the Italian Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates from beeing impatient, as former experience hath taught. Beſides, it is not honourable for the Apoſtolike Sea to keepe the Legates idle, and at
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:17208:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
anchor, without doing any good. That it was neceſſary, that, before they come to the acte, his Maieſtie ſhould bee ſecure of the intention and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as well of the Catholiques in <hi>Germany,</hi> as of the Proteſtants, eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing things againe in the Diet, cauſing authenticall mandates of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Princes to be diſpatched, his Maieſtie and the whole Diet together, binding themſelues to execute the Decrees of the Councell, that the paines and coſt prooue not vaine and ridiculous, and hereby to take all hope from whomſoeuer did thinke to diſturbe the Synode. That, in the third place, his Maieſtie ſhould conſider, that it was neceſſary to declare, that the Decrees already made in <hi>Trent,</hi> in matter of faith, and thoſe of other former Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, may not, by any meanes, bee queſtioned, nor that the Proteſtants may demand to bee heard concerning them. Laſtly, that hee ſhould tell the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that the Pope did beleeue, that his Maieſties good will towards him, was reciprocall, and that, as hee did readily condeſcend to fauour the affaires of his Maieſtie, and of the Empire, by holding the Councell in a place ſo fit for his purpoſe, ſo hee deſireth that his ſincerity and realitie, may not bring a burthen vpon him. That hee hopeth, if any one ſhall attempt ought againſt it, by cauillations or calumnies, that his Maieſtie will not maruaile, if hee vſe the remedies which ſhall occurre, for defence of the authority giuen immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly by God to him, and the Apoſtolique Sea, as well in Councel as out.</p>
            <p>The Pope thought it profitable for his affaires, that his reſolution ſhould bee fully knowen in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germanie;</hi> and bade <hi>Iulius Cananus</hi> his Secretary, making ſhew to fauour ſome Courtiers, his friends, to communicate the foreſayd inſtructions vnto them, with obligation of ſecrecie: by which meanes they were ſpread euery where. The Pope had a ſpeedy anſwere from his new <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> For that King, vnderſtanding the cauſes, why the <note place="margin">The French King maketh large offers to the Pope.</note> Pope could haue but little confidence in the Emperour, in regard of ſome things paſt, thinking hee was much inclined to <hi>France,</hi> made great demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to bee well pleaſed with the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and his meſſage, offered to the Pope whatſoeuer he was able to doe for him, promiſed to aſſiſt the Councel, and to ſend the Prelates of his Kingdome, and all fauour and protection, for maintenance of the <hi>Papall</hi> authority.</p>

Hee added, that the foure conſiderations were all important, and reaſonably propoſed by his Holineſſe. That, for <hi>France,</hi> hee did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commend what he had conſulted, but offered to ioyne with him, to giue all poſſible ſecurity to that King. That it was reaſonable to cut off ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous charges, and not to ſuffer the Councel to bee open, and idle. That a Decree was made in <hi>Ausburg,</hi> a yeere ſince, that all <hi>Germanie,</hi> euen the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants alſo, ſhould ſubmit themſelues, a copie whereof hee would giue to the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and cauſe it to be confirmed in the preſent Diet. That he thought it not a fit time now to treate, that the things already decided in <hi>Trent,</hi> ſhould not bee queſtioned, becauſe it would bee done more opportunely in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:17208:163"/>
when the Councell was aſſembled. And for the authoritie of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and the Apoſtolique Sea, as hee hath formerly beene a protectour of it, ſo hee will bee hereafter, defending it with all his forces, and euen with his owne life, if there were occaſion. That hee could not promiſe his Holineſſe that no vnquiet ſpirit ſhould ſpeake or treate in the Councel, but he gaue his word, that, in caſe it did happen, hee would ſo oppoſe, that he ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him for his paines.</p>
            <p>The Emperour, as hath beene ſayd, was in <hi>Ausburg,</hi> to hold the Diet; <note place="margin">He propoſeth the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Councell in the Diet of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> and other things.</note> which, though it was not ſo compaſſed with armes as the former, yet it was alwayes armed. Hee propoſed the proſecution of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> the obſeruation of the <hi>Interim,</hi> made in the laſt Diet, and the finding a way for reſtoring of Eccleſiaſticall goods, and the renewing of iuriſdiction. It plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Catholique Princes, that the Councel ſhould bee proſecuted; but the <note place="margin">Conditions required by the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Councel.</note> Ambaſſadours of ſome Proteſtant Princes did not conſent, but with theſe conditions. That the things already determined in <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examined; that the Diuines of the Auguſtane confeſſion, ſhould not onely bee heard, but haue a deciding voyce; that the Pope ſhould not preſide, but ſhould ſubmit himſelfe alſo to the Councel, and releaſe the Biſhops of their oath, that they may ſpeake freely. The Emperour complayned of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, that his Decree of the <hi>Interim,</hi> was not obeyed by them; and of the Catholikes, that the reformation of the Clergy was not executed. Theſe excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelues, ſome by ſaying, that they were to proceede ſlowly auoyding diſſenſions; others, that the exempt, pretending priuiledges, would not obey. The Proteſtants layd the cauſe vpon the people, who, in regard the matter concerned their conſcience, did mutin, and could not bee forced. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, gaue an account to the <hi>Nuncio</hi> of all theſe particulars, ſhewing not onely the conſent of the Catholiques, and of the greater number of the Proteſtants, but the limitation alſo propoſed by the others, leſt, if hee had heard of it by ſome other meanes, it might haue produced ſome bad effect. But hee added, that hee would not haue this limitation put into the acts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Princes had giuen him their word, that they would doe nothing againſt his will; and therefore hee might affirme to the Pope, that all <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> was contented with the Councel. Afterwards, he treated more ſtrictly with the principall Eccleſiaſtiques, propoſing that the beginning ſhould be before Eaſter, and that they would goe thither in perſon. Which being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the Electors, hee ſolicited the Pope to make the conuocation for Eaſter, or immediatly after, becauſe hee was aſſured of the conſent of all <note place="margin">The Emperor haſtneth the conuocation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to ſee the Bull before it be publiſhed.</note> 
               <hi>Germany.</hi> Which the better to confirme, he prayed his Holineſſe, that when the Bull was made, hee would ſend him the draught, before it was publiſhed, that (ſhewing it to all in the Diet) hee might, by that occaſion, make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and cauſe it to bee receiued by all.</p>
            <p>The Pope thought that nothing was concluded of what was propoſed by him, ſo long as it was not decided, that the Decrees already made ſhould bee receiued. Hee would not, that, in the very beginning of the Councel, this ſhould bee diſputed of; becauſe the iſſue was plaine, that is, that much time would be ſpent, and nothing done, and in fine, all would bee diſſolued without concluſion. It was plaine to be ſeene, that the generall diſpute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:17208:163"/>
they ought to be receiued, did draw after it a particular of euery one, and that himſelfe ſhould not be able to interpoſe, becauſe it would bee alledged that he was to be ſuſpected, as hauing beene preſident, and the principall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour. To inſiſt more with the Emperour that this point might bee decided would giue him more diſtaſt, &amp; caſt all into inſuperable difficulties. He was counſelled, that, without ſaying any more, he ſhould take the point for deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <note place="margin">The Popes reſolution concerning the Decrees already made,</note> &amp; preſuppoſe in his <hi>Bul,</hi> that the Decrees already made ſhould be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all.

            <p>The Emperours Miniſters, and other zealous Catholiques, to whom the Emperour did impart it, thought it would exaſperate the Proteſtants, and giue them occaſion not to accept of the Councell, in which the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he would not onely preſide, but direct alſo. Beſides, to talke of reaſſuming and proſecuting it, was to put too many ſuſpicions into their heads; and to ſpeake ſo magnificently of his authoritie was nothing but to prouoke them. They councelled the Emperour to enduour that the Pope ſhould moderate the <hi>Bull,</hi> and reduce it into ſuch a forme, as might not more alcinate the Proteſtants. The Emperour treated thereof with the Nuncio, <note place="margin">The Emperor deſireth an alteration of the <hi>Bull.</hi>
               </note> and wrote to his Ambaſſadour to doe the like with the Pope, praying his Holineſſe affectionately, and effectually, and for Chriſtian charitie, to make
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:17208:164"/>
thoſe words more milde, which might diuers <hi>Germany</hi> from accepting the Councell. The Ambaſſadour in <hi>Rome</hi> treated with a Spaniſh dexteritie, and ſaid, That as wilde beaſts, taken in a ſnare, muſt be drawen gently, making ſhew to yeeld vnto them, nor muſt bee ſhewed the fire, or armes, for feare of prouoking them, and putting them in deſpaire, which will encreaſe their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo the Proteſtants muſt bee vſed, who with Gentleneſſe, and by inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting and hearing them, muſt be brought to the Councell, where being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued, it will bee a fit time to ſhew them the truth. That to condemne them before they were heard, was to exaſperate and prouoke them more. The Pope anſwered, according to his vſual libertie, that he would not be taught to fight with a Cat ſhut vp, but would haue it at libertie, that it might fly; that to <note place="margin">The Popes anſwere.</note> bring the Proteſtants with faire words to the Councel, where the deedes would not be anſwerable, was to put them in deſpaire, and make them take ſome raſh reſolution; and therefore what was to bee done, was to bee told them plainely, The Ambaſſadour anſwered, that it was true in things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or fit to be ſpoken: but he ſaw not how it was then fit to ſay, that it belongeth to him to direct Councels. That theſe things are moſt true; but trueth hath not this priuiledge to be ſpoken at al times, and in all places; and that it is good to conceale it, when the vttering of it doth produce a bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. That he ſhould remember, that, by the hot ſpeeches of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, and his Legate, Cardinal <hi>Caietan,</hi> the fire was kindled that now burneth, which, with a gentle word, might haue beene put out. That the Popes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, eſpecially <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> wiſe Princes did often complaine of it. If <hi>Germany</hi> may now begained with dextrous vſage; why ſhould it be more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated with bitterneſſe?</p>
            <p>The Pope, as it were diſdaining, ſayd, That it was to be preached openly, and inculcated, which CHRIST hath taught, that his diuine Maieſtie hath made his <hi>Vicar Head</hi> of the Church and the principal light of the world: that this is one of the truthes that muſt be ſpoken in all times, &amp; places, and (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> that to doe otherwiſe would bee againſt the commandement of CHRIST, <hi>Hiding the Candle vnder a buſhell, which ſhould be ſet on a Candleſticke.</hi> That it was not honourable for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike Sea to vſe artifice, and diſſimulation, but that hee ought to ſpeake plainely.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador, by way of a pleaſant diſcourſe, ſayd; That to hide the rod, and to make ſhew of benignitie, and to yeeld vnto all, ſeemed vnto him the true Apoſtolike office, that he had heard it read in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that being <hi>free, hee made himſelfe ſeruant of all, to gaine all;</hi> with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> a <hi>Iew,</hi> with the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, a Gentile;</hi> with the <hi>weake, weake; to winne them alſo:</hi> and that this was the way to plant the Goſpel. In fine the Pope, not to enter into diſpute, ſayde, that the <hi>Bull</hi> was made according to the ſtile of the Chancery, which could not be altered; that he was aduerſe from nouities, and muſt follow the ſteps of his Predeceſſors; that obſeruing the vſuall forme, whatſoeuer ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen could not be attributed to him, but if he had inuented a new, all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe would be laid to his Charge.

               </gap> hee can.

            <p>The world ſeeing this Decree, thought it, as it was, a iuſt counterpoiſe <note place="margin">Which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to bee a counterpoiſe to the Popes Bull.</note> of the Popes Bull; in all parts.

            <p>The yeere 1551. being begun, the Pope, applying himſelfe to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell intimated, had two principall ayes; to ſend truſtie perſons to preſide, <note place="margin">1551</note> and to bee at as little charge as was poſſible. To auoyde charge, hee <note place="margin">The Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the Councell are named.</note> thought to ſend but one Legate, but that was too great a burthen for one, becauſe there would bee none who had the ſame intereſts, on whom hee might ſafely relie, and becauſe hee ſhould bee eſteemed the onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of whatſoeuer was done. For which reſpects it was neceſſary to lay the burden on more mens ſhoulders. The Pope found a middle way, to ſend one Legate, and two <hi>Nuncij,</hi> with equall authoritie, thinking that ſo hee ſhould bee better ſerued, becauſe hope maketh men more diligent. Caſting his eye on all the Cardinalls, hee found none more truſtie, and withall more worthy, then <hi>Marcellus Creſcentius,</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of S. <hi>Marcellus;</hi> to whom hee ioyned for <hi>Nuncij, Sebastianus Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Siponto,</hi> and <hi>Aloiſius Lipomannus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona</hi> of the former hee made choyce, for the great confidence hee had
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:17208:165"/>
in him before his Papacy; of the other, for the fome of his great pietie, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and loyalty. Hauing had many ſecret parlies with theſe three, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened veto them the ſinceritie of his heart, and inſtructed them fully, hee gaue them an ample <hi>Mandate,</hi> to be preſent in the Councell, in his name; the tenor whereof was,</p>
            <p>It belongeth to the father of a family, to ſubſtitute others, to doe that <note place="margin">The tenor of their Mandat.</note> which hee cannot commodiouſly doe himſelfe. Therefore, hauing reduced to <hi>Trent</hi> the Generall Councel, intimated by <hi>Paul,</hi> hoping that the Kings and Princes, would affoord their fauour and aſſiſtance, hee cited the Prelates, who vſually haue voyce therein, to bee there the firſt of May, to reſume the Councel in the ſtate it was. But not beeing able to bee perſonally preſent, according to his deſire, in reſpect of his old age, and other impediments, that his abſence might not bee an hinderance, he appointeth <hi>Marcellus,</hi> a zealous, wiſe, and learned Cardinall, for Legate, and the Biſhops of <hi>Siponto,</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,</hi> famous for knowledge and experience, <hi>as Nuncij,</hi> with ſpeciall <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date,</hi> and fit clauſes.

That his inclination to <hi>France</hi> and his Maieſty was great, and his minde auerſe from thoſe who were emulous of him, and that this is knowen to the whole world. Yet the foreſaid reſpect is ſo potent that, if his M<hi rend="sup">tie</hi> would not giue a remedy, it were enough to make him caſt himſelfe into the armes of him that he would not. His inſtruction alſo was,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:17208:167"/>
that if the King would not be perſwaded to this, he ſhould pray him to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well how great inconueniences a Nationall Councell would draw after it, and that it would be a beginning to giue his Subiects licence, whereof hee would repent him, and would preſently cauſe this bad effect to hinder the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell, which would be the greateſt offence could be done to God, and the greateſt damage to faith, and the Church. He prayed him to ſend an Ambaſſadour to <hi>Trent,</hi> aſſuring him he ſhould receiue all honour and reſpect from the Preſidents, and all the Prelats who were his Holineſſe friends. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto if hee did not condeſcend, but perſeuere in maintaining the Edict, hee ſhould, for taking away all ſcandall, propoſe to him a temper, to declare, that his meaning was not to hinder the generall Councell by that Edict.</p>
            <p>The King, hearing the Ambaſſage, ſhewed alſo that his honour did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine <note place="margin">But he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth firme in his reſolution.</note> him to continue the protection of the Duke, and to maintaine the Edict, but with ſuch words, as made it plaine hee was diſpleaſed with the diſtaſtes giuen him, and that hee had a deſire to right himſelfe. And to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the Pope, hee ſent the Lord of <hi>Monluc,</hi> the <hi>Elect</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to him, not without ſome hope to pacifie the Popes minde. But doe hee what hee could, hee continued in the ſame rigidneſſe concerning the affaires of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and ſent the ſame <hi>Monluc</hi> backe, with commiſſion to complaine of the King, that hee had ſent the Edict of the Nationall Councell, and letters, to the Prelates who were ſubiects to his Holineſſe, euen in temporalities (vnderſtanding the Biſhop of <hi>Auignion)</hi> as farre as to <hi>Rome,</hi> which all the world did interpret to be done onely to hinder the generall Councell. And, in concluſion, hee prayed the King, that ſeeing they were both reſolute, himſelfe to correct <hi>Octauius,</hi> and his Maieſtie to protect him, at the leaſt their differences might bee contained within <hi>Parma,</hi> though his Maieſtie had already proceeded further, by taking the Cardinals and Prelates from <hi>Rome;</hi> whoſe departure hee would not hinder, hoping that his Maieſtie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing exhaled his anger, ſhould bee illuminated by God, to change his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding. Neither theſe mutuall offices, nor the reſpect of the Councell, could make either of theſe Princes remit any thing of their rigor. The generall conſent was fauourable to the King. For the Emperour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſeized on <hi>Piacenza,</hi> to leaue <hi>Parma</hi> to him alſo, was to giue all <hi>Italie</hi> into his hands; and it ſeemed an indignity, that the poſtetity of <hi>Paul,</hi> who had ſo laboured for the liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhould bee abandoned by all: and if the Pope did not complaine that <hi>Piacenza</hi> was vſurped, nor made any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for the reſtitution, why ſhould hee complaine that the Duke ſhould ſecure himſelfe of <hi>Parma.</hi> And this reaſon preuailed ſo much with ſome, that they aſſured themſelues it was well vnderſtood by <hi>Iulius;</hi> but that, to make ſome thing ariſe which might hinder the Councell, which not procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from him, might bee aſcribed to another, hee deſired a warre betweene the King and the Emperour. It is certaine that hee laboured more with the Emperour to mooue armes againſt <hi>Parma,</hi> or <hi>Mirandula,</hi> then with the King to accommodate the buſineſſe. The King hauing tried all meanes to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Popes minde, paſſed to the extreame, which was to proteſt by his <note place="margin">And proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the Councell, then aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in <hi>Trent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>But in <hi>Germany</hi> there was more ſpeach of the Councell then euer.

And <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> Duke of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> who, a little before, ſucceeded his father, cauſed another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to be made by his people, which was the ſame thing in ſubſtance; and the one part did approoue that of the other; yet did chooſe not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ioyntly, that the Emperour might not ſuſpect. Afterwards Duke <hi>Maurice</hi> wrote to the Emperour, giuing him an account of his being in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with his Diuines, and of the writing which hee had prepared; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that his <hi>Safe Conduct</hi> ſeemed not ſufficient. For in the Councell of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> it was determined, that they might proceede againſt thoſe that came to the Councell, though they had <hi>Safe Conduct</hi> from the Emperour; and the <note place="margin">And require a <hi>Safe Conduct</hi> from the Councell.</note> Decree was approued by the death of <hi>Iohn Huſſe,</hi> who went to the Councell vnder the publike faith of <hi>Sigiſmond.</hi> That therefore hee could not ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to <hi>Trent,</hi> if thoſe of the Councell did not giue <hi>Safe Conduct,</hi> as was done in that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> whither the Bohemians, for the example of <hi>Constance,</hi> would not goe; but vnder the publique faith of the whole Councell. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee prayed the Emperour to procure for them a <hi>Safe Conduct</hi> from the Eccleſiaſtiques of <hi>Trent,</hi> in that forme as thoſe of <hi>Baſil</hi> did grant it to the <note place="margin">Which the Emperour promiſeth to procure.</note> Bohemians, becauſe they were iuſt in the ſame condition now, as the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians were then. <hi>Caeſar</hi> promiſed to doe it, and gaue order to his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, whom he then diſpatched to the Councell, to procure it.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſage conſiſted of three perſons, to honour the Councell, and to haue many miniſters to treate; and this colour was for the number, that one was for the Empire, another for <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the third for his other States, <note place="margin">Who ſendeth three Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours to the Councell.</note> and yet all <hi>in ſolidum</hi> for all.

That, by the preſence of the two Electours, being entred into hope, that many Biſhops, of that and other Nations, will aſſiſt in the Councel, they thought fit, in the meane time, in regard of the place they bare, to giue a little admonition to themſelues, and them, (though they ſaw all were ready to doe the office of good Paſtours) becauſe the matters to bee handled were of great moment; that is, to extirpate hereſies, to reforme Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall diſcipline, from the corruption whereof hereſies haue riſen, and finally, to pacifie the diſcords of Princes. That the beginning of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, ought to be taken from the knowledge of their owne inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, flying to the aſſiſtance of GOD, who will not faile them: whereof they ſee many arguments already, but eſpecially the comming of the two Princes. That the authority of Generall Councels, was alwayes very great, the holy Ghoſt preſiding in them, and their Decrees eſteemed not humane, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine. That an example hereof hath beene left by the Apoſtles, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers following, ſeeing that, by Councels, all heretiques haue beene condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the life and manners of Prieſts and people reformed, and the diſcords of the Church appeaſed. Therefore being now aſſembled to doe as much, they muſt awaken themſelues, that they may regaine the ſheepe that lept out of the Lords fold, and keepe thoſe which haue not gone aſtray as yet. Wherein the ſaluation of thoſe only is not in queſtion, but their owne too, in regard they muſt giue an account to GOD, by whom, if they performe their duety, they ſhall be rewarded, and all poſterity will attribute great praiſe to that Councel; but they ſhould not aime at that, but onely at their owne duety, and charity towards the Church, which beeing afflicted, wounded, and depriued of ſo many deare children, lifteth vp her hands to GOD, and them, to reſtore them to her. That therefore they would handle the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Councel with all gentleneſſe, and without contention, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſo great an aſſembly, vſing perfit charity, and conſent of minds, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that GOD doeth behold and iudge them.</p>
            <p>The exhortation beeing ended, the Decree was read by the Biſhop that <note place="margin">The Decree of the Seſſion is read.</note> ſaid Maſſe; the ſubſtance whereof was; That the holy Synode, which, in
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:17208:169"/>
the Seſſion paſt, did determine to proceed in this, hauing deferred to doe it vntill now, by reaſon of the abſence of the Germane Nation, and the ſmall number of the Fathers, reioycing for the arriuall of the two Prince Electors, hoping that many more of that and other Nations, will, by their example, haſten their comming, doth deferre the Seſſion for fourty dayes, that is, vntill the eleuenth of October, and proſecuting the Councell in the ſtate in which it is, hauing treated alreadie of the ſeauen Sacraments, of Baptiſme, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, doth ordaine to treat of the Euchariſt; and, for reformation, to handle thoſe things which doe facilitate reſidencie. Then the Emperours Proxie beeing read, the Earle of <hi>Mountfort</hi> ſaid, that the Emperour, after hee had obtayned the reduction of the Councel to <hi>Trent,</hi> neuer ceaſed to labour that the Prelates of his ſtates ſhould goe thither, which the preſence of the Electours, and the frequencie of the Fathers, doth demonſtrate. And to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his mind the more, he hath ſent <hi>Don Pedro</hi> of the Kingdome of <hi>Spaine,</hi> another of his patrimoniall States, and himſelfe of <hi>Germanie,</hi> though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, Praying to be receiued for ſuch. <hi>Iohn Baptiſta Caſtello,</hi> the Speaker, anſwered, in the name of the Councell, that they were glad to heare the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours <hi>Mandate,</hi> hauing by it, and the quality of the Proctours, conceiued how much they may promiſe themſelues; therefore that it hopeth for aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from them, and doth, as much as it can, admit the Emperours <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date.</hi> Likewiſe the Proxie of the King of the Romanes, in the perſon of <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Gregorianus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Zagabria,</hi> and of <hi>Fredericke Nauſea,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> was read, and this ſecond did ſpeake, and was anſwered as thoſe of the Emperour.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Iacobus Amiotus,</hi> Abbat of <hi>Belloſana,</hi> appeared in the name of the French King, with letters of his Maieſty, which he preſented to the Legate, <note place="margin">The Abbat of <hi>Balloſana</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth the French Kings letters, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of giueth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſt to the Synode.</note> deſiring they might be read, and his credency heard.

The ſuperſcription was, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſsimis in Christo Patribus Conuentus Tridentini.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Orange,</hi> and after him, the other Spaniards ſaid aloud, that thoſe letters were not ſent vnto them, who were a generall Councel, and not a Conuent; and therefore that they ought neither to bee read, nor opened in publike Seſſion, but, if the Meſſenger had ought to ſay, hee ſhould goe home. Much was ſpoken concerning the ſignification of the word, <hi>Conuentus,</hi> the Spaniards perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting that it was iniurious. So that the Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> was forced to ſay, that if they would not receiue a letter from the King of <hi>France,</hi> who called them <hi>Sanctiſsimus Conuentus,</hi> how would they hearken to the Proteſtants, who called them <hi>Conuentus Malignantium?</hi> But the Spaniſh Prelats continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill to be more tumultuous then the reſt, the Legate, with the <hi>Nuncij,</hi> and the Emperours Ambaſſadours, retired into the veſtry, and had a long diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation hereof. At the laſt, returning to their place, they made it bee told to the Speaker, that the Synode doth reſolue to reade the letters without preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, thinking that the word <hi>Conuentus,</hi> is not meant in an ill ſence; and, if it be, doth proteſt of the <hi>Nullitie.</hi> Then the Kings letter was opened, and read, which was dated the 13. of Auguſt, and ſaid in ſubſtance; That it ſeemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the obſeruance which his anceſtors haue alwaies vſed towards the Church, to ſignifie to them the cauſes why he hath bin forced not to ſend any

               </gap>nt, called by <hi>Iulius</hi> by the name of a publike Councel, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that they the fathers wil not condemne any mans fact before they know it, and that when they ſhal vnderſtand what he hath done, they wil commend it. That he was compelled, for preſeruation of his honour, to continue in his reſolution to protect the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> from which hee would not refuſe to depart, if Iuſtice and Equity did permit. That hee writeth to them as to <hi>Honourable Iudges,</hi> praying them to receiue the letters, not as from an adder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, <note place="margin">The contents of them.</note> or a perſon vnknowen, but as from the Prince and principall ſonne of the Church by inheritance of his Anceſtors, whom hee promiſeth alwayes to imitate, and, while he defendeth himſelfe from wrongs, not to lay aſide his charity towards the Church, but euer to receiue whatſoeuer ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by her, ſo that due order be obſerued in making the Decrees. The let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">The Abbat readeth a proteſtation.</note> being recited, the Abbat read a Proteſtation, containing a narration of a Proteſtation, made by Termes, in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſaying, That the King, after hee had taken vpon him the defence of <hi>Parma,</hi> ſeeing that thoſe laudable things which hee had done were reprehended, vſed great care that <hi>Paul</hi> Termes, his Ambaſſador, ſhould giue an account of all to the Pope, &amp; Colledge of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, to take from them all ſiniſter opinion, ſhewing that the taking of the Duke into his protection, was the effect of a pious, humane, and kingly minde, wherein there was no cunning or priuate gaine, but reſpect onely of the Church; as appeared by the propoſitions of accord, which aymed at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that the Church might not be robbed, and <hi>Italy</hi> preſerued in peace and libertie. And if the Pope thought this a cauſe to put all <hi>Europe</hi> into warre, he was ſorry; but it could not be imputed to him, hauing not onely accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but offered alſo all honeſt and fit conditions. Neither could the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Councell aſſembled bee preſcribed to him, praying the Pope to conſider what miſchiefes would accompany the war, and to preuent them with peace. Which if his Holineſſe will not regard, but deſire rather to ſet <hi>Europe</hi> on fire, and hinder the Councell, giuing ſuſpicion that it was called not for the good of the Church, but for priuate intereſts, excluding from it a moſt Chriſtian King, hee could not chooſe but to proteſt to him and the Colledge, that he could not ſend his Biſhops to <hi>Trent,</hi> where the acceſſe is not free and ſecure, and that he could not eſteeme that a generall Councell, but priuate from which he was excluded, neither could the people or Prelates of <hi>France</hi> be obliged to the decrees of it. Afterwards he proteſted that he would come to the remedies vſed by his anceſtors in like occurrences; not to take away his due obſeruance from the Apoſtolique Sea, but to reſerue it for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, when armes ſhall bee laid downe, which are diſhoneſtly taken vp againſt him, deſiring of his Holineſſe, that this Proteſtation might bee regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and giuing him a copie of it to peruſe. Theſe things hauing beene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proteſted in <hi>Rome,</hi> he deſired ſhould be likewiſe proteſted in <hi>Trent,</hi> with the ſame inſtance, that they might be regiſtred in the actes of that aſſembly, and that there being a publike inſtrument made of it, he might vſe it in time and place.</p>
            <p>When the Proteſtation was read, the Speaker, hauing talked with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, anſwered in ſubſtance; That the Kings modeſty in his letters was gratefull to the Synode; that it doth not accept the perſon of the Abbat, but
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:17208:170"/>
as it is lawfull, that warneth him to bee in the ſame place the eleuenth of October, to receiue the anſwere which ſhall bee made to the Kings letters; and forbiddeth the <hi>Nuncij</hi> to make an inſtrument of the preſent action, but ioyntly with the Secretary of the Councell. And nothing elſe beeing to bee done, the Seſſion was ended. Then the Abbat demaunded an inſtrument of the action, but could not obtaine it.</p>
            <p>When Termes had proteſted in <hi>Rome,</hi> though many did not know of the <note place="margin">The cenſure of this Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation.</note> act, yet it was beleeued that the Pope would deferre the Councell, becauſe it muſt needes bring forth new diuiſions, if ſuch a principall Nation did reſiſt. But he deceiued the world, not for any deſire hee had to celebrate it, but for that he would not ſeeme to be cauſe of the diſſolution; being reſolued, that if it were ſeparated without him, hee would anſwere, with an open mouth, to whoſoeuer ſhould deſire it again, that he had done his part, and would do no more. But the Proteſtation made in <hi>Trent,</hi> a place ſo conſpicuous, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently publiſhed euery where, and gaue matter of diſcourſe. The <hi>Imperialists</hi> eſteemed it a vainity, ſaying, That the act of the maior part of the vniuerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is euer eſteemed lawfull, when the leſſer, being called, either cannot or wil not be preſent: that all are called to the Councell, and the Frenchmen alſo might haue come without paſſing by the Popes territories; but in caſe they could not, yet their abſence doth not derogate from the Councell, becauſe they are not neglected, but inuited. It was ſaid to the contrary, that to call in words, and to exclude in deeds, was not to inuite, and, for the Popes ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, one might goe from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Trent</hi> without paſſing by them, but not without paſſing by thoſe of the Emperour, and the maior part hath full authoritie, when the leſſer cannot appeare, and is ſilent, becauſe it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed to conſent, and when it will not appeare, becauſe it is accounted contumacious, but when it doth proteſt, it bath its place, and eſpecially, if the impediment proceed from him that calleth the action, in abſence, cannot be of force.</p>
            <p>And the Counſellors of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſaid ſome thing more; <note place="margin">The Decrees of Councels do not binde the Churches abſent.</note> That it is true, that the authoritie of the whole vniuerſalitie is transferred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the maior part, when the cauſe is common to all, and nothing belongeth to particular men: but when the whole belongeth to all, and euery one hath his part, the aſſent of euery one is neceſſary, <hi>Et prohibentis conditio potior;</hi> and the abſent, not giuing their voyces, are not bound. Of this ſort are Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall aſſemblies, and bee the Councell as populous as it will, the abſent Churches are not bound if they thinke fit not to receiue it. This hath alwayes beene vſed in ancient times, that the Councels beeing ended, the Decrees ſhould be ſent, to be confirmed, to the Churches that were abſent, in which otherwiſe they had no force; which euery one that readeth <hi>Hilarius, Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Theodoretus,</hi> and <hi>Victorinus,</hi> who handle this particular, may ſee plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

For it hauing no other ground then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charity, and the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, it would neuer bee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that theſe were preſent in an aſſembly, againſt which a moſt Chriſtian King, perſecutor of all Sects, with the adherence of a kingdome, not blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Religion, did proteſt in that forme. And they brought an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for proofe. For they ſaid, that the Preſidents retyring to conſult with the Emperours Ambaſſadours, did ſhew who guided the Councell. And which was of more importance, when theſe fiue had conſulted, and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing to any body elſe, the Speaker ſayd, The holy Synod doth receiue the letters. And what was that holy Synode? And likewiſe the Abbats ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition <note place="margin">The Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents take vpon them the authority of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> beeing read, the anſwere, reſolued on by the Preſidents onely, was giuen in the ſame name. Neither can the difficulty bee remooued, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the matter was of no great importance; firſt, becauſe it will be hard to maintaine, that it is not a moſt important matter, where the danger of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion in the Church is in queſtion; then, be it as it will, no man can arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to himſelfe power, to declare what is of importance, and what not: and this is a demonſtration that things are carried iuſt as the Pope ſayth in the Bull, and the Preſidents in the Sermon read, that they were to direct the Councell; for they did ſo indeed. The adulſe that the King had diſmiſſed the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and publiſhed a <hi>Manifest,</hi> did reiterate the ſame diſcourſes; <note place="margin">The French King diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Popes <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and publiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Where he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at large the cauſes why he tooke vpon him the protection of <hi>Parma,</hi> bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Pope for the warre begun, ſaying that hee vſed this Artifice, that the Councell might not be held; Concluding in the end, that it is not meete that he ſhould haue money out of his kingdome, to make warre againſt him, whence a great ſumme is ordinarily taken for vacancies, Bulls, Graces, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, and Expeditions: and therefore, by the counſell of his Princes, he did for bid to diſpatch Curriers to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to anſwere money, or gold or ſiluer not coyned, by way of banke, for Benefices or other Graces and Diſpenſations, vpon paine of Confiſcation, as well for Eccleſiaſtiques as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and theſe to bee puniſhed corporally beſides, giuing the Promooters a third of the confiſcation. This <hi>Manifeſt</hi> was inrolled in Parliament, with a propoſition of the Attourney generall of the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which he ſaid, that it was no new thing, but vſed by <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, and was conformable to the common Law, that money ſhould not bee carried to the enemie, and that it would bee a hard caſe, if with the money of <hi>France,</hi> warre ſhould bee made againſt the King, and that it was better for the ſubiects of the kingdome to keepe their money, and not care for diſpenſations, which were not able to ſecure the conſcience, and are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſhadow caſt before the eyes of men, which cannot hide the trueth from GOD.</p>
            <p>It could not be endured, neither at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor in <hi>Trent;</hi> that the King ſhould <note place="margin">What the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whereunto the French-men anſwered, that antiquity had not this opinion; yea, <hi>Victor</hi> the third, who was one of the Popes that aſſumed much, ſayd that the Apoſtolique Sea was his miſtreſſe. The ſame was ſayd
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:17208:171"/>
before him by <hi>Stephen</hi> the fourth, and by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>italianus,</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> who were more ancient, it plainely appeareth, that by the Apoſtolike Sea is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for if the Pope were the ſame thing, his errours and defects, would be of the Apoſtolike Sea.</p>
            <p>The French King, fearing that, by his diſſention with the Pope, thoſe that deſired change of religion, would make ſome innouation, which might <note place="margin">The French King waxeth more ſeuere againſt the Proteſtants.</note> prooueſeditious, or that himſelfe might come into the bad opinion of his people as if his minde were auerſe from the Catholike faith, and perhaps to open a way for reconciliation with <hi>Rome,</hi> hee made a moſt ſeuere Edict againſt the Lutherans, confirming all the others which hee had publiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, adding greater puniſhments, more wayes to diſcouer the guilty, and greater rewards to the Promooters.</p>
            <p>The Emperour, conſidering that the French King, in regard of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the French Cardinals, and other dependants of that Crowne, had no leſſe power in the Colledge then himſelfe, and being combined with the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſi, did farre exceede him, though he had the Pope of his ſide, ſent to <hi>Rome Don Iohn Manriques,</hi> to perſwade his Holineſſe to create new Cardinalls, to exceed, or equalize the number of the French. The Pope was enclined here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; yet hee ſaw what difficulty there was, his Papacie being new, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and in time of ſtirres, when it is hard to haue the conſent of all the Cardinalls; and to create them without conſent was dangerous. Hee was doubtfull whether to make many at once, or by little and little. He thought hee ſhould ſooner obtaine conſent for this ſecond courſe, and that his truſty friends would remaine in hope, and that the Cardinalls would more oppoſe a numerous promotion, and thoſe that were excluded would deſpaire. He doubted whether it were fitte to create any of the Prelats of the Conucell; becauſe there were many that deſerued well, and the three Electors were not to bee paſſed ouer, eſpecially the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> who thought of it. On the other ſide, to ſend red Cappes to the Councell, hee thought would mooue enuie. Hee reſolued not to expect Chriſtmas, when all come foorth with their pretenſions, and the places of common meetings are full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but to execute this buſineſſe ſome day before vpon the ſudden; though afterwards he found no fit time to create them, but Chriſtmas.</p>
            <p>But to returne to <hi>Trent,</hi> the ſecond of September, the day following the Seſſion, a generall Congregation was made, and, in it, Fathers deputed to frame the Articles of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> to bee giuen to the Diuines, and to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the abuſes in that matter. Afterwards they diſcourſed of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; which becauſe it was to take away the cauſe why Biſhops doe not reſide, many were repeated, ſome propoſed before in <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Bolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and ſome then firſt ſpoken of. Finally, they inſiſted vpon iuriſdiction; ſaying that the Biſhops were wholly depriued of it, partly by auocation of cauſes, and partly by appeales, but eſpecially by exemptions: yea, that more often iuriſdiction was exerciſed ouer and againſt them by their Subiects, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſpeciall commiſſion from <hi>Rome,</hi> or by vertue of <hi>Conſeruatories,</hi> then by them ouer their ſubiects. And Fathers were elected to frame the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles concerning this matter.

That CHRIST ought not to bee worſhipped in the Euchariſt, nor honoured in feaſts, not carried in proceſſion, nor to the ſicke, and that the worſhippers are truely Idolaters 6. That the Euchariſt ought not to bee ſaued, but ſpent, and diſtributed immediatly and that he that doth not ſo doth abuſe this Sacrament and that it is not lawfull for any to giue the Communion to himſelfe. 7. That in the particles which remaine after the Communion, the Body of our LORD doth not remaine, but onely while it is receiued, and neither before nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 8. That it is <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> to giue both kinds to the people and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and that they ſinne who force them to vſe one onely. 9.

            <p>In diuers Congregations all the voyces, were comfortable. For the firſt Article that it ſhould becondemned for hereticall, as formerly it had beene <note place="margin">Opinions are deliuered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the articles.</note> In the ſecond there were three opinions. Some ſaid it was to bee omitted, for that no heretique doeth denie the Sacramentall Communion. Others held it onely for ſuſpected and ſome would haue deliuered it in clearer tearmes. The common opinion was, that the third was hereticall; but that it was not fit to condemne, or ſpeake of it, becauſe it was an opinion inuented by <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Tutcienſis,</hi> more then foure hundred years ſince, and neuer followed by any, therefore to ſpeake of it, would (contrary to the precept of the wiſe man) mooue the euill, which beeing quiet hurted not. They added, that the Councell was aſſembled againſt the moderne hereſies, and therefore that they were not to take paines in the old. Concerning the fourth Article, there were diuers opinions. Some ſaid, that the word, onely, beeing taken away, the opinion was Catholique, to ſay that the Euchariſt is for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes, and that word was not put by any of the heretiques, and therefore they thought this Article might to omitted. Some ſayd it was he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall, though the word onely were remooued, becauſe the Sacrament of the Euchariſt as not inſtituted for the remiſſion of ſinnes. In the fift, all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, and many amplifications were vſed to perſwade the worſhip, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new wayes propoſed to enlarge it, as the deuotion of euery one had found out. Likewiſe they allagreed in the ſixt, except in the laſt part, that is, that it is not lawfull to giue the Communion to himſelfe. Some ſaid, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnderſtood of the Laiques, it was Catholique; and therefore it muſt bee expreſſed, that it is to bee condemned onely in regard of the Prieſt. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſayd, that neither in regard of theſe it was to bee condemned for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall becauſe in the ſixt Councell, the hundred and one chapter, it was not condemned. Others would, that, for the Laiques alſo, the caſe of neceſſity ſhould be excluded. In the ſeuenth, all powred themſelues out into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

it were, becauſe our Sauiour in the foure and twentieth of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> did bleſſe the bread onely to the two Diſciples: and becauſe, in the Lords Prayer, wee aske our dayly bread; and becauſe, in the Actes of the Apoſtles, in the ſecond, and twentieth Chapters, Bread onely is ſpoken of, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſhip, in the ſeuen and twentieth, bleſſed nothing but the Bread. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of the ancient Doctors, and ſome examples of the Fathers were brought, but they grounded themſelues principally vpon the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and the cuſtome of the Church, as alſo vpon diuers figures of the Olde Teſtament, and drew many prophecies alſo to this ſence. And, concerning the children, all agreed that perhaps it might formerly bee done by ſome particular man, but was, by all others, knowen to bee an errour. In the ninth Article, the firſt part, that as much is not contained vnder one <hi>Species</hi> as vnder both, was thought to bee hereticall, by the Dutch Diuines; but the Italians ſayd it muſt bee diſtinguiſhed, before it could bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For if it were vnderſtood in reſpect of the vertue of the conſecration, it is cleare that vnder the bread there is the body onely, and vnder the wine, the blood onely; but by conſequence, which the Diuines call <hi>Concomitancie,</hi> vnder the bread there is the blood, ſoule, and diuinitie, and vnder the wine, there is the body, and the other things; and therefore it is not to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſo generall termes. But for the ſecond, that as much is receiued by one as by both, there was a difference; for many did thinke, that although no more of the Sacrament, yet more grace was receiued; ſo that they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a declaration herein. In the tenth ſome would haue the firſt part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of dead faith, becauſe there is no doubt but that a liuely faith is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. For the neceſſitie of Confeſſion, the Dominicans conſidered, that many learned and holy Catholiques held that opinion, ſo that to condemne that would bee to condemne them. Others propoſed, for a temper, that it ſhould not bee condemned as hereticall, but as pernicious. Some would haue this condition added, if there were commodity for a Confeſſor. The laſt part, for communicating at Eaſter, it not beeing commanded by the Law of GOD, but by the Church onely, the common opinion was, that it ought not to bee condemned for hereticall, it being a thing not heard of, that one ſhould bee condemned of hereſie, for not approouing a particular humane precept. Many Diuines did propoſe another Article alſo, taken out of the writings of <hi>Luther,</hi> which was neceſſary to condemne. And it was this: that although there was a neceſſitie to recite the words of CHRIST, yet they are not the cauſe of the preſence of CHRIST in the Sacrament, but the cauſe is, the faith of him who receiueth it.</p>
            <p>After all the diuines had ſpoken, the deputed Fathers did collect ſeuen <note place="margin">Out of which 7. <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſmes</hi> are compoſed.</note> 
               <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> out of their opinions, which being propoſed in the generall Congregation, it was firſt of all conſidered, that it was not fit to paſſe ouer the matter with <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> onely; that this was not to teach, but onely to confirme; that the ancient Councels had not done ſo, which alwayes had expounded the Catholike opinion, and then condemned the contrary; that the ſame ſucceeded well to this Councell, in the matter of Iuſtification; and although it was forced, in the Seſſion of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to change this courſe, for vrgent reſpects, yet that was rather to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:17208:173"/>
bee imitated which was then done by reaſon, then that which was after chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by neceſſitie. This opinion was cheriſhed by the Italian Diuines, who ſaw there was but one way to regaine their reputation loſt. For as the Dutch and Flemiſh Diuines were of abilitie to prooue the concluſions by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo to expound them, and finde their cauſes, there was neede of Schoole Diuinitie, in which themſelues were well ſeene. This opinion did preuaile; and order was giuen, that the Heads of doctrine ſhould bee framed, and Fathers deputed to ſee it done. The Heads were reduced to the number of eight. Of the Reall preſence. Of the Inſtitution. Of the excellencie. <note place="margin">Eight heads of doctrine are propoſed to bee diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> Of Tranſubſtantiation. Of worſhip. Of preparation to receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. Of the vſe of the Cup, in the Communion of the Laitie. Of the Communion of Children. It was propoſed alſo to make a collection of the abuſes which did occurre, and to adde the remedies. Then, in that Congregation, and ſome of thoſe that followed, the Fathers began to ſpeake their opinion concerning the ſeuen <hi>Anathematiſmes:</hi> wherein nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable was ſayde, but that, in condemning thoſe who confeſſed not the reall preſence of the Lords body, many deſired that the Canon ſhould bee more fat and pregnant (for ſo their wordes were) that, in the Euchariſt, there is the body of IESVS CHRIST, the ſame which was borne of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irgin,</hi> did ſuffer on the Croſſe, was buried, rayſed, and aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, ſitteth on the right hand of GOD, and ſhall come to iudgement. And ſome of them called to minde, that there wanted one very important point, that is, to declare, that the Miniſter of this Sacrament is the Prieſt, lawfully ordained. Which they did, becauſe <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers doe often ſay, that euery Chriſtian may doe it, euen a woman.</p>
            <p>But the Earle of <hi>Montfort,</hi> perceiuing that they treated of a matter much controuerſed, eſpecially of the Communion of the Cup, which was the moſt palpable, popular, and beſt vnderſtood by all, hee thought that, if <note place="margin">The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of the Emperor and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> diſſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And hauing imparted this to his Colleagues, and the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> they went all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the Preſidents, to whom, when they had ſhewed what paines <hi>Caeſar</hi> had taken, both in warre, and in the negotiation to make the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſubmit to the Councell, which they would neuer doe if they went not thither, they ſhewed that they ought to apply themſelues principally to this; and, to that end, the Emperour had giuen them a Safe conduct. But they were not contented with it, alleadging that it was decreed in the Councel of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and really executed, that the Councell is not bound by the Safe conduct of any, whatſoeuer hee bee; and therefore they required one from the Synode, which was promiſed to them by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who gaue charge to them his Ambaſſadours to obtaine it of the Councell. Whereunto the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate making a very complementall anſwere, and referring himſelfe to the Seſſion which ſhould bee held, to gaine time, that hee might giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof to <hi>Rome,</hi> the earle added, that for the ſame cauſe, he thought it not fit, that, before their comming, the controuerſed points of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> ſhould bee handled; that there wanted not matters of reformation to be treated on, or others, in which there was no difference. The Legate
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:17208:173"/>
anſwered, that it was reſolued long agoe to handle the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> neither could it be altered, becauſe it was concluded before, that the Decrees of faith and reformation ſhould goe hand in hand, and that the matter of the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt</hi> did follow that of reformation, which was handled laſt, before they went to <hi>Bolonia.</hi> But hee ſayd, that this was more controuerſed with the Zinglian Suiſſes, then with the Proteſtants, who are not Sacramentaries; as thoſe. The Count ſpake of the Communion of the Cup, and ſaid, that if that point were decided againſt them, which is vnderſtood by all the people, and a thing whereon they ſtand moſt, it was impoſſible to reduce them. That, <hi>Caeſar</hi> alſo in the Decree of the <hi>Inter-religion,</hi> was forced to yeeld in this, and therefore deſired that they would be pleaſed to deferre it vntill the comming of the Proteſtants. The Legate did not refuſe, but paſſed it ouer with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and vnconcluding wordes, that hee might firſt vnderſtand the Popes minde, vnto whom hee gaue an account of whatſoeuer was handled by the Diuines, and of the <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> framed, and of that which was diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <note place="margin">The Legate giueth the Pope an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all.</note> in matter of reformation (whereof wee will ſpeake hereafter) and then hee gaue aduiſe of the two requeſts of the Emperours Ambaſſadours, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an anſwere.</p>
            <p>The Pope put theſe things in conſultation; and, for the lafe conduct, found varietie of opinions. Some would not haue it giuen, alleadging that <note place="margin">Who cauſeth a conſultation to be held.</note> it was neuer done but by the Councell of <hi>Baſill,</hi> which was not to bee imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any thing; and that it was a great preiudice to binde themſelues to rebels, though any thing might bee endured if there were hope to gaine them; but there was none at all; yea rather, in ſtead of that, there was reaſon to feare that ſome would bee peruerted, as <hi>Vergerius</hi> was, though not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet in ſome part; from which contagion the moſt principall Prelates, and the moſt obliged to the holy Sea, haue not beene exempted. On the other ſide it was ſayd, that, not out of hope to conuert, but to leaue them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, it was fit to giue them all ſatisfaction; but the rather, becauſe the Emperour for his owne intereſts, had made greater inſtance, whom it was neceſſary to pleaſe now, becauſe, <hi>France</hi> being aliened, they were wholly to depend on him: and it was better to preuent, and doe that willingly, which of neceſſitie was to bee done. And, concerning the preiudices, it might bee made in ſuch a forme, that it ſhould not binde at all, or very little. Firſt, by not deſcending to name the Proteſtants, but in generall, the Eccleſiaſtikes and Seculars of the German Nation, of euery condition. For ſo, vnder the generall wordes, it may bee ſaid they are comprehended, or, that it is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Catholikes onely, and not of them, alleadging that for them, a ſpeciall and expreſſe mention was neceſſary. Then the Synod may grant a ſafe Conduct for it ſelfe, and the Popes authoritie will bee reſerued. Then Iudges, concerning faults committed, may bee deputed, and the election <note place="margin">And anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thus.</note> left to them, to auoyd ſuſpicion. So that vigor of diſcipline, and authoritie of puniſhing would bee retained, and no ſhew made of yeelding or remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing. This opinion preuailed with the Pope, who, according to that forme, made a draught of the ſafe Conduct, and anſwered the Legate, commending his wiſedome in the anſwers hee had giuen, reſoluing that the ſafe Conduct ſhould bee granted in the forme hee ſent him, and that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:17208:174"/>
of the Cup ſhould bee deferred, and the Proteſtants expected, but not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue three moneths, or little more, not beeing idle in the meane while, but making a Seſſion betweene, to treate of Penance, which hee would not haue deferred aboue fourtie dayes, or little more. Hee aduertiſed them alſo, that the Canons, in matter of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> were too full, and that it were better to diuide them.</p>
            <p>While they conſulted in <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Trent</hi> they went on to handle the points of doctrine; wherein they proceeded as eaſily, as before, in diſcuſſing the Articles. But when they came to expreſſe the manner of exiſtence, how CHRIST is in the Sacrament, and the <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> how the Body of CHRIST is made of the Bread, and the Blood of the Wine, it could not be <note place="margin">A contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In ſumme, the Dominicans would not haue it ſaid that Chriſt was in the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> becauſe he went thither from another place where he was before, but, becauſe the ſubſtance of the Bread is turned into his Body, the Body being in the place where the bread was, without going thither; and becauſe all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the bread is turned into all the ſubſtance of the Body, that is, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Bread into the matter of the Body, and the forme into the forme, it is properly called <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> And therefore there are two ſorts of the exiſtence of CHRIST our Lord, both of them reall, true, and ſubſtantiall, one, as he is in heauen, whither he aſcended, when he parted from the earth, where hee firſt conuerſed; the other, as hee is in the Sacrament, in which he is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is where the ſubſtances of the bread and wine, conuerted into him, were firſt. The firſt exiſtence is called naturall, becauſe it agreeth to all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; the ſecond, as it is ſingular, ſo it cannot bee expreſſed with any name agreeing to others, nor can bee called Sacramentall, which were as much as to ſay, that it was not there really, but as in a ſigne, the Sacrament being nothing but an holy ſigne, except by Sacramentall one would vnderſtand a reall manner, proper to this Sacrament onely. The Franciſcans would haue it ſaid, that one body may, by Gods omnipotencie, bee truely and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially in many places, and when it doeth get a new place, it is in it, becauſe it goeth thither, not by a ſucceſſiue mutation, as when it leaueth the firſt place to get the ſecond, but in an inſtant, in which it gaineth the ſecond, without loſing the firſt; and that God hath ſo ordained, that where the body of CHRIST is, there ſhould remaine no other ſubſtance, not by annihilation, becauſe the ſubſtance of CHRIST ſucceedeth in place of it, and therefore it is truely called <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> not becauſe the one ſubſtance is made of the other, as the Dominicans ſay, but for that the one doeth ſucceede the other. The manner of CHRISTS being in heauen and in the Sacrament dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth not in ſubſtance, but in quantitie onely: becauſe in heauen the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the body poſſeſſeth as much ſpace as is proportionable to it, and it is ſubſtantially in the Sacrament without poſſeſſing any place. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both ſorts are true, reall, and ſubſtantiall, and, in regard of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, naturall alſo: in reſpect of the quantitie the exiſtence in heauen is naturall, and in the Sacrament miraculous, differing in this onely, that in
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:17208:174"/>
heauen the quantity is truely a quantity, and in the Sacrament, hath the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a ſubſtance. Either partie was ſo wedded to their owne opinion, that they affirmed it to be plaine, cleere, and intelligible to all, and oppoſed infinite abſurdities againſt the other. The Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> who, with <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes Groperus,</hi> was aſſiduous at the diſputations, to vnderſtand this matter, in that which one party oppoſed againſt the other, he gaue a reaſon to them both, in that which either of them affirmed, hee ſaid, he deſired ſome proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and that they ſhould ſpeake as vnderſtanding the matter, not, as they ſeemed to doe, by cuſtome and habite of the Schooles. Diuers draughts were made by both ſides, to expreſſe theſe myſteries, and ſome were compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by taking ſome thing from either partie. But none gaue ſatisfaction, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to the <hi>Nuncio <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erona,</hi> who was the principall Superintendent in this matter. It was determined in the generall Congregation, to vſe as few words as was poſſible, and to make an expreſſion ſo vniuerſall, as might bee accommodated to the meaning of both parties: and the care heereof was committed to ſome Fathers and Pheologues, with the ſuperintendencie of the foreſaid <hi>Nuncio.</hi>

            <p>In the end of this Congregation, it was propoſed that a collection ſhould <note place="margin">The abuſes occurring therein rre noted.</note> be made, of the abuſes occurring in this matter, with remedies againſt them, and, in the Congregations following, many were recounted.

That, in adminiſtring the holy Communion, great indecencie is vſed, by ſome pariſh Prieſts, who haue not ſo much as a cloath, for him that communicateth, to hold in his hand. That, (which is of moſt importance) the communicants doe not know what they receiue, nor are inſtructed of the dignity, and fruit of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

The reformation was handled, at the ſame time, when there was diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in matter of faith, but by other Congregations, in which the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts did aſſiſt; which diſcuſſions, not to interrupt the matter, I haue brought all together to this place. And becauſe the purpoſe was to reforme the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall iuriſdiction, this place requireth (for the vnderſtanding of what will be ſayd vpon this, and many other occaſions hereafter) that the originall ſhould bee declared, and how, beeing mounted to ſo great power it became ſuſpected to Princes, and terrible to the people. CHRIST hauing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel, and adminiſter the Sacraments, hee left alſo to them, in perſon of all the faithfull, this principall precept, To loue one another, charging them to make peace, betweene thoſe that diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and, for the laſt remedie, giuing the care thereof to the body of the Church, promiſing it ſhould bee bound and looſed in heauen, whatſoeuer they did binde and looſe on earth, and whatſoeuer two did aske with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent, ſhould bee granted by the Father. In this charitable office to giue ſatisfaction to the offended, and pardon to the offender, the Primitiue Church was alwayes exerciſed. And, in conformity of this, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned, that brothers, hauing ciuill ſuites one againſt another, ſhould not goe to the Tribunals of the Infidels, but that wiſe men ſhould be appoynted to iudge the differences; and this was a kind of ciuill Iudgement, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had a ſimilitude of a criminall; but were both ſo different from the iudgements of the world, that as theſe are executed by power of the Iudge, who enforceth ſubmiſſion, ſo thoſe onely by the will of the guilty, to receiue them, who refuſing them, the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge remaineth without exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and hath no power, but to foreſhew the iudgement of GOD, which, according to his omnipotent good pleaſure, will follow, in this life, or the next.</p>
            <p>And indeed, the Eccleſiaſticall iudgement did deſerue the name of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <note place="margin">The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is handled at the ſame time with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but in diuers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.</note> in regard that it only did induce the guilty to ſubmit, and the Church to iudge with ſuch ſincerity, that neither in the one any bad effect could haue place, nor iuſt complaint in the other; and the exceſſe of charitie in corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, did make the corrector to feele greater paine then the corrected; ſo that, in the Church, no puniſhment was impoſed, without great lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the multitude, and greater of the better ſort. And this was the cauſe <note place="margin">A diſcourſe of the Authour concerning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>opall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</note> why to correct, was called to <hi>lament.</hi> So Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> rebuking the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, for not chaſtiſing the inceſtuous, ſaid, <hi>You haue not lamented to ſeparate ſuch a tranſgreſſour from you.</hi> And in another Epiſtle, I feare that when I come vnto you, I ſhall not finde you ſuch as I deſire, but in contentions and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and that at my comming, I ſhall <hi>lament</hi> many of thoſe who haue ſinned before. The iudgement of the Church (as is neceſſary in euery multitude) was fit that it ſhould be conducted by one, who ſhould preſide and guide the action, propoſe the matters, and collect the points to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted on. This care, due to the moſt principall, and worthy perſon, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes committed to the Biſhop. And where the Churches were many, the propoſitions and deliberations were made by the Biſhop, firſt in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Prieſts and Deacons, which they called the Presbyterie, and there were ripened, to receiue afterwards the laſt reſolution in the generall
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:17208:175"/>
Congregation of the Church. This forme was ſtill on foote in the yeere two hundred and fiftie, and is plainely ſeene by the Epiſtles of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who in the matter concerning thoſe who did eate of meates offered to Idols, and ſubſcribe to the Religion of the Gentiles, writeth to the Presbytery, that hee doeth not thinke to doe any thing without their counſell, and conſent of the people; and writeth to the people, that, at his returne, hee will examine the cauſes, and merits thereof, in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and vnder their iudgement; and hee wrote to thoſe Prieſts, who, of their owne braine, had reconciled ſome, that they ſhould giue an account to the people.</p>
            <p>The goodneſſe and charitie of the Biſhops, made their opinion for the moſt part to be followed, and by little and little, was cauſe that the Church, charitie waxing colde, not regarding the charge layd vpon them by CHRIST, did leaue the care to the Biſhop; and ambition, a witty paſſion, which doth inſinuate it ſelfe in the ſhew of vertue, did cauſe it to be readily embraced. But the principall cauſe of the change was the ceaſing of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. For then the Biſhops did e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ect as it were a tribunall, which was much frequented; becauſe as temporall commodities, ſo ſuites did encreaſe. The iudgement, though it were not as the former, in regard of the forme, to determine all by the opinion of the Church, yet it was of the ſame ſincerity. Whereupon <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſeeing how profitable it was to determine cauſes, and that, by the authoritie of Religion, captious actions were diſcouered, which the Iudges could not penetrate, made a Law that there ſhould lye no appeale from the ſentences of Biſhops, which ſhould bee executed by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Iudges: and if in a cauſe depending before a ſecular tribunall, in any ſtate thereof, either of the parties, though the other contradict, ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Epiſcopall iudgement, the cauſe ſhall be immediately remitted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p>Here the tribunall of the Biſhop, began to be a common pleading place, hauing execution by the Miniſterie of the Magiſtrate, and to gaine the name of Epiſcopall iuriſdiction, Epiſcopall audience, and ſuch like. The Emperor <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alence</hi> did enlarge it, who, in the yeere 365. gaue the Biſhops the care ouer all the prizes of vendible things. This iudiciall negotiation pleaſed not the good Biſhops. <hi>Poſsidonius,</hi> doth recount that <hi>Auſtin,</hi> being imployed herein, ſometimes vntill dinner time, ſometimes longer, was wont to ſay, that it was a trouble, &amp; did diuert him from the things proper vnto him; and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe writeth, that it was to leaue things profitable, and to attend things tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous and perplexed. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not take it to himſelfe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not fit for a Preacher, but would haue it giuen to others. Afterwards ſome Biſhops, beginning to abuſe the authoritie giuen them by the law of <hi>Constantine,</hi> that law was ſeuentie yeeres after, reuoked by <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and an ordination made that they ſhould iudge cauſes of religion, and not ciuill, except both parties did conſent, and declared that they ſhould not be thought to haue a Court. Which law being not much obſerued in <hi>Rome,</hi> in regard of the great power of the Biſhop, <hi>Valentinian</hi> being in the Citie, in that yeare 452. did renew it, and made it to be put in execution. But a little after, ſome part of the power taken away was reſtored by the Princes that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:17208:176"/>
followed; ſo that <hi>Iustinian</hi> did eſtabliſh vnto them a Court, and audience, and aſſigned to them the cauſes of Religion, the Eccleſiaſticall faults of the Clergie, &amp; diuers, voluntary iuriſdictions alſo ouer the Laitie. By theſe degrees the charitable correction, inſtituted by CHRIST, did degenerate into do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and made Chriſtians looſe their ancient reuerence and obedience. It is denyed in words, that Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction is dominion, as is the ſecular, yet one knoweth not how to put a difference betweene them. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> did put it, when he wrote to <hi>Timothie,</hi> and repeated it to <hi>Titus,</hi> that a Biſhop ſhould not be greedy of gaine, nor a ſtriker. Now on the contrary, they make men pay for proceſſes, and impriſon the parties, as is done in the ſecular Court.</p>
            <p>But the Weſterne Countries being ſeparated, and an Empire made of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> and a kingdom of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in theſe foure Prouinces the Biſhops, for the moſt part, were made Counſellors of the Prince, which, by the mixture of ſpirituall and temporall charges, cauſed their iuriſdiction to encreaſe exceedingly. Before 200. yeeres were paſt, they pretended ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely all iudicature, criminall and ciuill, ouer the Cleargie, and, in ſome things, ouer the Laitie alſo, pretending that the cauſe was Eccleſiaſticall. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this kinde of Iudicature, they inuented another, which they called mixt, in which the Magiſtrate or the Biſhop might proceed againſt the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which of them tooke the cauſe in hand firſt; whereby in regard of their exquiſite diligence, neuer leauing place to the ſecular, they appropriated all vnto themſelues; and thoſe which remained out of ſo great a number, were comprehended in the end by a generall rule, eſtabliſhed by them, as a ground of faith, that euery cauſe is deuolued to the Eccleſiaſticall Court, if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate will not, or neglect to doe iuſtice. But if the pretenſions of the Cleargie were contained within theſe bounds, the ſtate of Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes were tolerable. The people and Princes, when they ſaw it mount to theſe vnſupportable termes, might with Lawes and ſtatutes haue brought the iudgements to a ſufferable forme, as formerly vpon occaſion hath beene done. But that which put Chriſtendome vnder the yoke, tooke from it, in the end all meanes to ſhake it from the necke. For after the yeere 1050. all the cauſes of the Cleargy being appropriated to the Biſhops, and very many of the Laitie, vnder title of ſpiritualitie, and almoſt all the reſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of a mixt iudicature, and placing themſelues aboue ſecular Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, vpon pretence of iuſtice denied, they came to ſay, that the Biſhop had that power to iudge, not by the grant or conniuency of Princes, or by the will of the People, or by cuſtome, but that it was eſſentiall to the Epiſcopall dignitie, and giuen to it by CHRIST.</p>
            <p>And though the Lawes of the Emperours remaine in the <hi>Codes</hi> of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> and <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> in the <hi>Capitulars</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere,</hi> and others of later Princes of the Eaſt and Weſt, which doe all ſhew plainely, how, when and by whom this power hath beene graunted, and all Stories, as well Eccleſiaſticall as prophane, doe agree in declaring the ſame grants and cuſtomes, adding the reaſons and cauſes, yet ſo notorious a trueth hath not had ſuch power, but that a contrary affirmation onely, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proofe, hath been able to ouercome it; which the Canoniſts haue ſo farre
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:17208:176"/>
maintained, as to publiſh thoſe for heretikes who doe not ſuffer themſelues to bee hoodwinckt. And not ſtaying heere they adde, that neither the Magiſtrate, nor the Prince himſelf, can meddle in any of thoſe cauſes which the Clergie hath appropriated, becauſe they are ſpirituall, and of ſpirituall things the Laiques are vncapeable. Yet the light of trueth was not ſo put out but that learned and godly men, in thoſe firſt times, did oppoſe that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, ſhewing that both the Premiſſes of that diſcourſe were falſe, &amp; that the Maior, that is, that the Laiques are vncapeable of ſpiritual things, was abſurd, and impious. For they are adopted by the heauenly Father, called the ſonnes of God, brothers of CHRIST, partakers of the Kingdome of heauen, made worthy of Diuine grace. Of Baptiſme, and of the Communion of the fleſh of CHRIST. What other ſpirituall things are there beſide theſe? And if there were, how can hee, who is partaker of theſe which are the chiefeſt, be ſayde abſolutely in generall termes to be vncapeable of ſpirituall things? But they ſayd that the Minor was falſe alſo, that cauſes appropriated to the Epiſcopall iudicature are ſpirituall. For all either delicts or contracts: which, conſidering the qualities, giuen by the holy Scripture to ſpirituall things, are as farre from being ſuch, as earth is from heauen. But the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the better part could not ouercome the greater, and ſo; vpon the ſpirituall power, giuen by CHRIST to the Church, to binde and looſe, and vpon the inſtitution of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to compoſe contentions betweene Chriſtians, without going to the tribunall of Infidels, in much time, and by many degrees, a temporall tribunal hath beene built, more remarkeable then euer was any in the world, and in the midſt of euery Ciuill gouernement another inſtituted, not depending on the Publike, which is ſuch a kinde of Common-wealth, as not one of as many as haue written of gouernments would haue imagined could ſubſiſt. I will omit to ſpeake how the paines of ſo many, beſides the obtaining of the wiſhed end. To make themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the publike, haue, before they were aware, rayſed an Empire, there being a more difficult opinion ſprung vp, taking root with admirable progreſſe, which giueth to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> as much at once, as hath, in 1300. yeeres, beene gained by ſo many Biſhops, by ſuch extraordinarie meanes, not making the power to binde and looſe the foundation of iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but the power of feeding, and ſo affirming, that all iuriſdiction was giuen the Pope by CHRIST, in the perſon of <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſayd to him, <hi>Feede my ſheepe.</hi> For ſo it will be ſaid in the third reduction of the Councell, when great tumults were raiſed by this opinion, which ſhall then be recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But by that which hath been now declared, euery one may of himſelfe, conceiue what remedies were neceſſarie, to giue a tolerable forme to a matter, broken out into ſo great corruptions, and compare them with theſe that were propoſed.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Trent</hi> there were two defects conſidered; that is, that the charitie of the ſuperiours was turned into domination, and the obedience of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours into complaints, ſubterfuges, and lamentations; and they firſt thought of prouiding, in ſome ſort, againſt them both. But in proſecuting the firſt, which is the fountaine from whence the ſecond is deriued, they vſed onely an exhortatorie remedie to the Prelates to take away domination, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:17208:177"/>
charitie. And for the inferiours, many ſubterfuges, beeing mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to delude iuſtice, three heads onely were taken, <hi>Appeales,</hi> abſolutorie graces, and complaints againſt the Iudges. <hi>Iohannes Groperus,</hi> who aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in that Councell as a Diuine and a Lawyer, ſpake honourably of <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales,</hi> and ſayd, that while the heat of faith remained in the breſts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>Appeales</hi> were not heard of. But charitie in the Iudges waxing colde, and place being giuen to paſſion, they entred into the Church, for <note place="margin">A diſcourſe of <hi>Iohannes Groperus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as the firſt iudicatures belonged not to the Biſhop onely, but to him with the councell of his Prieſts, ſo the <hi>Appeale</hi> was not deuolued vnto one man, but vnto another Congregation. But the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, taking away the Synods, did inſtitute Courts and officers, like the ſeculars. Neither did the miſchiefe ſtoppe there, but paſſed to greater abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes then in the Secular court. For there the firſt <hi>Appeale</hi> is onely to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſuperiour, neither is it lawfull to leape to the higheſt, nor permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in the articles of the cauſe to appeale from the Decrees of the Iudge which they call interlocutories, but it is neceſſarie to expect the end. But in the Eccleſiaſticall Courts one may appeale from euery acte, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the cauſes infinite, and immediately to the higheſt Iudge, which carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them out of the Countreys, with great charges, and other intolerable miſchiefes. This hee ſaid hee did declare, to conclude, that if they would reforme this matter, which is wholly corrupted, and doeth not onely hinder reſidencie, as in the Congregations of ſo many worthy Doctours and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers was conſidered, but corrupteth the whole diſcipline, and is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance, charge, and ſcandall to the people, it was fit to reduce it to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or as neere to it as might bee, ſetting a perfect <hi>Idea</hi> before their eyes, and ayming at that, to come as nigh to it, as the corruption of the matter doth comport. That the well inſtituted monaſticall religions haue forbidden all appeale; that this is the true remedie. Hee that hath not beene able to goe ſo high, hath moderated them, granting them within their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and forbidding them without; which ſucceeding well, as appeareth, to keepe thoſe gouernments in order, it would worke the ſame effect in the publike gouernments of the Church, if the Appeales were confined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſame Prouince. And to effect this, and to bridle the malice of the liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants, it is ſufficient to reduce them to the forme of the Common lawes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the <hi>Leap,</hi> that is, to go to the higheſt without paſſing by the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſuperiours, and by forbidding <hi>Appeales</hi> from the Articles, or the interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutory Decrees: with which prouiſions, the cauſes will not goe farre, will not be drawne in length, will not cauſe exceſſiue charges, and other innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable grieuances, and, that the ſentences may paſſe with ſinceritie, to reſtore the Synodals, which are not ſubiect to ſo great corruptions, remouing thoſe officers by whom the world is ſo much ſcandalized, becauſe it is not poſſible that <hi>Germany</hi> ſhould endure them.</p>
            <p>This opinion was not willingly heard, except by the Spaniards &amp; Dutch-men. But the Cardinall &amp; the <hi>Nuncio</hi> of <hi>Siponto,</hi> were diſpleaſed that hee went ſo farre. For this was to take away, not onely the profit of the Court, but the honour alſo, no cauſe would goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> and by degrees, euery one would
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:17208:177"/>
forget the ſuperioritie of the Pope, it beeing an ordinary thing with men, not to eſteeme that Superiour, whoſe authoritie is not feared, or cannot be vſed. Therefore they cauſed <hi>Iohn Baptista Castellus,</hi> of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> to ſpeake in the next Congregation, in the ſame matter, in ſuch ſort, as that without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting <hi>Groperus,</hi> the appearance, which the reaſons alleadged by him did make ſhould bee darkened.

He thanked GOD that the Church was not oppreſſed, as when the Arians did ſcarce ſuffer it to appeare: and ſaid, that antiquitie ought not ſo to be commended, as that ſomething in the latter age, may not bee reputed better. Thoſe who praiſe the Synodall iudicature, haue not ſeene their defects, the infinite length in the diſpatches, the impediments in the diligent examination, the difficulty to informe ſo many, the ſeditions made by the factious: it is to bee beleeued that they haue beene intermitted, becauſe they did notſucceed well, and that the Courts and Officers haue beene brought in, to remedy thoſe diſorders. It cannot be denied, that theſe haue ſome that deſerue to be prouided againſt; which is fit to doe, without reſtoring that which was aboliſhed, becauſe it was intollerable. In <hi>Appeales,</hi> the cuſtome was to paſſe by the intermediate Superiours, and not, at the firſt, to leap to the higheſt; which was taken away, becauſe the Gouernours of Prouinces and Countries, were become Tyrants ouer the Church, and for a remedie, all buſineſſes were carried to <hi>Rome.</hi> This hath its inconueniencies, the great diſtance of place, and charge; but they are more tollerable then oppreſſion, He that would reduce the firſt cuſtome, ſhould find that in ſtead of redreſſing one euill hee ſhould cauſe many and euery one greater. But aboue all it muſt be conſidered, that the ſame publike thing muſt not alwayes bee ordered in one manner, but as time hath mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo it is fit to change the gouernment. The ancient manner of gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning will not be profitable, except the ancient ſtate of the Church doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. Hee that, ſeeing how children are gouerned, and how the libertie of eating and drinking any thing, at any time, is cauſe of health and ſtrength, ſhould thinke an old man might doe ſo, would find himſelfe much deceiued. The Churches were little, compaſſed with Pagans, vnited amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as beeing neere the enemy; now they are great, without any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to keepe them in their duetie; whereupon the common things are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and it is neceſſarie they ſhould be cared for by one. If the cauſes did continue in euery Prouince, within a few yeeres there would bee ſuch diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, that one would bee contrary to another, and they would not ſeeme to be of the ſame faith and religion. The Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> tooke not vpon them in ancient times many parts of gouernment, when they ſaw it was good, but reſerued it to themſelues when it was abuſed by others. Many ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Popes were of holy life, and good intenſion, who would haue reſtored it, but that they ſaw, that, in a corrupt matter, it could not be well vſed. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion was, that to preſerue the vnity of the Church, it was neceſſary to leaue things as they are.</p>
            <p>Neither did this pleaſe the Italian Prelats, who would haue the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie preſerued, yet withall, ſome thing reſtored to themſelues, eſpecially
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:17208:178"/>
being to reſide; therefore they came to moderate the buſineſſe. To reſtore Synodall iudicatures was reiected by almoſt all, becauſe it did diminiſh the Epiſcopall and was too popular. To appeale by degrees, though it was maintained by many; yet it was excluded by pluralitie of voyces. To ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from the definitiues alone, was accommodated with a limitation, that it ſhould be onely in criminall cauſes, others beeing left in the ſame ſtate, though perhaps they had more neede to be reformed. For proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perſons of the Biſhops, no man deſiring to facilitate the iudicature againſt himſelfe, the reſtoring of it to Parochiall Synods, vnto which it did formerly belong, was not ſpoken of, but they deſired to prouide that, it remaining in the Popes hands, it ſhould paſſe with greater dignitie of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, moderating the commiſſions which came from <hi>Rome,</hi> by which they were forced to appeare, and ſubmit themſelues to perſons of an inferior ranke. And this was ſo earneſtly deſired by all, that it was neceſſary for the Legat to yeeld vnto it, though he was not pleaſed with any exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Biſhops, becauſe all was taken from the Pope which was giuen to them.</p>
            <p>The Dutch Prelates did propoſe, that the lawes of the <hi>Degradations</hi> might be moderated, as being intolerable, and giuing much occaſion of complaint in <hi>Germany.</hi> For it being a pure ceremonie which hindereth Iuſtice, and <note place="margin">The Dutch Prelates com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the lawes of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation.</hi>

Therefore when any Cleargie man, either willingly, or by the lawes was to returne to ſecular fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or, for ſome faults, was made ſubiect to that Court, the Biſhops did take from him the degree, with the ſame ceremonies with the which he was inueſted, ſpoilng him of the habits, and taking out of his hand the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the aſſignation of which he was deputed to the miniſterie. Being apparelled iuſt as if hee were to miniſter in his charge, hee was to be ſtripped firſt of that, which was laſt in the ordination, and with contrary words to thoſe that were vſed in the promotion. And this was very vſuall in thoſe firſt times after <hi>Constantine,</hi> for three hundred yeeres. But about the yeere ſixe hundred, a cuſtome was brought in, not to permit Cleargie-men of holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to returne to the world, and to others it was granted to doe it at their pleaſure; whereupon, by little and little, the <hi>Degradation</hi> of the leſſer was who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſuſed, and that of the greater was reſtrained onely to this caſe, when they were to be made ſubiect to the ſecular Court.

               </gap> Prieſthood by the Biſhop. And after that criminall iudicature ouer the Clergie was granted to the Biſhops, the Degradation remained onely when the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was death, which, in regard of the dignity of their order, the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtiques would not haue inflicted vpon a Clergie man. But, in caſes of exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant wickedneſſe, it ſeemed that it could not be denied, without ſcandall; therefore they found a way to doe that indirectly, which directly they could not, ſaying, it was iuſt that the offences of the Clergie ſhould bee puniſhed with deſerued death, but the Degradation was firſt neceſſary: which they made ſo difficult, by circumſtances of ſolemnitie, that very ſeldome it could bee done. And this procured a greater reuerence of the Clericall Order, with whoſe blood iuſtice had nothing to doe, if ſo much ſolemnitie did not precede. It was iuſtly ordered that the Biſhops ſhould not doe it but in publique, apparelled with the holy veſtments, and, which more imported, with the aſſiſtance of twelue Biſhops, in the Degradation of a Biſhop, of ſixe, in the Degradation of a Prieſt, of three, in the Degradation of a Deacon, who were to bee preſent in their Pontificall ornaments. And it ſeeming ſtrange, that a Biſhop, who might giue a degree without companie, could not take it away alone, Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third remooued the marueile, with a maxime, which hath not much probability, ſaying, that temporall buildings are hardly erected, and eaſily pulled downe, but ſpirituall contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, are eaſily built, and hardly deſtroyed. The vulgar held the Degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a neceſſary thing, and, when it happened, ranne to it, with vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able frequencie. But learned men doe know the bottome of it. For hauing determined, that, in the collation of the Order, a ſigne is imprinted in the ſoule, called a Character, which is impoſſible to blot out, or remooue by Degradation, this remaineth a pure Ceremony, performed for reputation onely. In <hi>Germanie,</hi> there beeing but few Biſhops, it could not bee done without immenſe charge, to bring ſo many into one place. And thoſe Dutch Prelates, who were in the Councell, for the moſt part Princes, did know more then others, how neceſſary it is, for examples ſake, to puniſh, with death, the wickedneſſe of Prieſts: wherefore they deſired that prouiſion ſhould be made therein. This particular was much diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and, in the end, it was reſolued not to change the Ceremony by any meanes, but to finde a temper, that the difficulty and the coſt might be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated.</p>
            <p>The Legat, though euery weeke he had giuen an account to the Pope of all occurrences, yet he was willing to eſtabliſh in Congregation the draughts of the Decrees, that he might ſend a copie of them, and receiue an anſwere before the Seſſion. Wherefore, the generall Congregation being aſſembled, not making mention of what was written to him from <hi>Rome,</hi> hee made a relation of that which the Earle of <hi>Mountfort</hi> had repreſented, adding that the requeſt for a Safe Conduct ſeemed reaſonable, and alſo the deferring of whatſoeuer could bee deferred with honour. For hauing appointed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to ſpeake of the Euchariſt, the firſt day of September, they could not chooſe but doe it, but to omit ſome point more important, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſed,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:17208:179"/>
was a thing which might be granted. And the voyces beeing col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, all were of opinion, that the Safe Conduct ſhould bee giuen, but concerning the matter to bee handled, ſome thought that it was not for their honour to deferre it, if the Proteſtants did not giue ſecuritie that they would come to handle it, and ſubmit themſelues to the determination of the Councell. Others ſaid, that their honour was ſaued, if it were done at their <note place="margin">A diſpute what points of doctrine are to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, vntill the comming of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> requeſt; and this was the more common opinion. Then the Legate added that they might reſerue the matter of miniſtring the Cup to the Laitie: and, to ſhew that they did not come for one Article onely, they might ioyne alſo with it the Communion of Children. And order was taken to compoſe the Decree in this particular. Which beeing read, ſome thought it was too little to reſerue two Articles, and therefore that it was better to diuide the firſt into three, and ſo reſerue foure, and to adde the Sacrifice of the Maſſe; the controuerſies whereof are great. For ſo it will appeare, that many things are reſerued, and the moſt principall; and in this opinion all did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. And when it was ſayd that the Proteſtants deſire to bee heard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe, a Prelate of <hi>Germanie</hi> ſtoode vp, and asked, by whom, and to whom this requeſt was made; becauſe it did much import that this ſhould appeare; otherwiſe when they ſhould ſay it was not true, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Councell would bee much blemiſhed. But there beeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what Count <hi>Mountfort</hi> had ſayd as of himſelfe, and that alſo not reſtrained to thoſe foure heads, nor to the matter of the Euchariſt, but in generall of all the Controuerſies, they were much troubled how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue. To ſhew that this reſeruation was made by their owne motion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that it was an indignitie, it did draw an obiection vpon them, that they ought to reſerue all. This way was found to bee leaſt ill, not to ſay that the Proteſtants make requeſt, but that they deſire to bee heard; whereof there can bee no doubt made, becauſe they haue ſayd it vpon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers occaſions; and though they meant concerning all the controuerſies, yet it is no falſitie to ſpeake that of a part, which is ſpoken of the whole number, not excluding the reſt. Some thought that this was to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues behinde a thread; but yet it did paſſe, becauſe they knew not how to doe better. For this cauſe, the matters reſerued beeing to bee taken out of the Heads of doctrine, and the <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> theſe which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned were, for more perſpicuitie, diuided, and reduced to eleuen, When they were to make the Decrees againſt the abuſes, they knew not where to put them. Amongſt thoſe of faith they were not to bee placed, beeing of Ceremonies and vſes. With thoſe of Reformation they did not agree, in regard of the diuerſity of the matter. To ranke them by themſelues was a nouitie, and did alter the order ſet downe. After a long diſpute it was concluded to omit them now, and after to place them with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Maſſe. The points of the Reformation were accepted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficultie, hauing beene already eſtabliſhed by themſelues. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained the forme of the Safe Conduct, which was referred to the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to compoſe, by the helpe of thoſe who had experience in ſuch things; which aſſiſted the Legate to make that forme paſſe which was ſent him from <hi>Rome.</hi>

The eleuenth of October beeing come, they went to the Church, as they were wont. The Biſhop of <hi>Maiorica</hi> ſang Maſſe, and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Torre</hi> made the Sermon, which was all in the praiſe of the Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> And other vſuall Ceremonies being performed, the Decree of the doctrine was read by the Biſhops that did celebrate the Maſſe. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof was: That the Synod aſſembled to declare the ancient faith, <note place="margin">A Seſſion is held.</note> and to remedy the inconueniences cauſed by the Sectes, did deſire, from the beginning, to roote cut the cockle, ſowed in the field of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">The Decree of doctrine concerning the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
               </note> teaching the Catholike doctrine, euer beleeued by the Church, it doth prohibite all the faithfull hereafter to beleeue, teach or preach, otherwiſe then is declared. Firſt, it teacheth that in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> after the Conſecration, CHRIST is contained, truely, really, and ſubſtantially, vnder the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of the ſenſible things, notwithſtanding he is in heauen, by a naturall exiſtence, becauſe he is preſent in his ſubſtance in many other places, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, in a maner of exiſtence, which is beleeued by faith, and can hardly be expreſſed by words. For all the ancients haue profeſſed, that CHRIST did inſtitute this Sacrament in the laſt Supper, when, after the benediction of the Bread and Wine, hee ſayd, in cleare and manifeſt words, that he gaue his Body and Blood, which hauing a moſt plaine ſignification, it is great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe to wreſt them to imaginary figures, denying the trueth of the Fleſh and Blood of CHRIST. Afterwards it teacheth, that CHRIST hath inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Sacrament in memory of himſelfe, ordayning it ſhould be receiued as a Spirituall foode of the ſoule, as a medicine for our dayly faults, a preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue from mortall ſinne, a pledge of eternall glory, and a ſigne of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy whereof himſelfe is the Head. And though it bee common to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with others, to bee a ſigne of a ſacred thing, yet it hath this proper to it ſelfe, that other hauing vertue to ſanctifie in the vſe, this doth conteine the author of Sanctity before the vſe. For the Apoſtles had not receiued the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> from the hand of our Lord, when he ſayd that it was his Body: and the Church hath alwayes beleeued, that the Body of CHRIST is vnder the bread, and the Blood vnder the wine, by vertue of the Conſecration; but, by concomitancie, as much is vnder either of the kindes, and euery part of them, as vnder both; declaring that by the Conſecration of the Bread and Wine, there is made a conuerſion of their whole ſubſtance into the ſubſtance of the Body and Blood of CHRIST, which conuerſion the Catholique Church hath called <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> by a fit and proper terme. Therefore the faithfull doe giue the honour of <hi>Latria,</hi> or diuine worſhip, due vnto God, to this Sacrament, and it hath been religiouſly inſtituted to make a particular feaſt for it euery yeere, and to carry it in proceſſion, in pubique places. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the cuſtome to keepe it in an holy place is auncient and hath been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the time of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell, and to carry it to the ſicke is an old cuſtome, beeing reaſonable beſides, and commanded in many Councels. And if it be not fit that any holy thing ſhould be handled without ſanctity, much more none ought to come to this Sacrament without great reuerence, and proofe made of himſelfe: which proofe muſt bee, that none hauing mortally ſinned, though hee bee contrite, may receiue it, without ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> which the Prieſt alſo, who is to celebrate, ought to obſerue,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:17208:180"/>
ſo that hee can finde a Confeſſour; and if hee cannot, hee muſt confeſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately afterward. It doeth teach alſo that there bee three kindes of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> One Sacramentally onely, as ſinners doe; another ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, as thoſe doe, who receiue it with a liuely faith, and deſire; the third conteineth both kindes, as thoſe doe receiue it, who, hauing prooued themſelues, as aforeſaid, doe goe to the Table. And there is an Apoſtolicall Tradition, and ſo it ought to bee obſerued, that the Liaitie ſhould receiue the Communion from the Prieſts, and the Prieſtes ſhould Communicate Themſelues. In the ende the Synode prayeth all Chriſtians to agree in this doctrine. When the Decree was ended, the eleuen <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> were read. 1. Againſt him that ſhall denie that, in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> is contained truely, <note place="margin">The <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſmes.</hi>

That in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> there doeth remaine the ſubſtance of the bread and wine with the Body and Blood of CHRIST, or ſhall denie that admirable conuerſion of all the ſubſtance of the bread into the body, and of the wine into the blood, there remaining onely the forme, which conuerſion the Church moſt appoſitely calleth <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation.</hi> 3. That, in the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> vnder euery kinde, and vnder euery part beeing ſeparated, all CHRIST is not contayned. 4. That, the Conſeoration beeing made, he is not there, but in the vſe, and neither before nor after, and that hee is not in the particles, which remaine after the Communion. 5. That, the principall fruit of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is the remiſſion of ſinnes, or that it hath no other effect. 6. That CHRIST in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> ought not to bee worſhipped with the honour of <hi>Latria,</hi> nor honoured with a particular feaſt, nor carried in proceſſion, nor put in a publique place, to bee worſhipped, or that the worſhippers are Idolaters. 7. That it is not lawfull to keepe it in an holy place, but that it ſhould bee diſtributed to the ſtanders by, or that it is not lawfull to carrie it honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to the ſicke. 8. That CHRIST in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is eaten onely ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, and not Saoramentally, and really. 9. That the faithfull being of age, are not bound to communicate euery yeere at Eaſter. 10. That it is not lawfull to the Prieſt, who celebrateth, to communicate himſelfe. 11. That faith onely is a ſufficient preparation to receiue it: Declaring in the ende, that the preparation ought to bee by the meanes of Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Confeſſion, holding him to bee excommunicate who ſhall teach, preach, affirme pertinaciouſly, or defend in publique diſputation, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>The Decree of the Reformation containeth firſt a long admonition to <note place="margin">The Decree of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the Biſhops, to vſe their iuriſdiction moderately, and charitably; then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth, that in cauſes of viſitation, correction, and inability, and in the criminall, none may appeale from the Biſhop or his Vicar generall, before the definitiue, or from an irreparable grieuance; and when there ſhall bee place of <hi>Appeale,</hi> and a Commiſſion ſhall bee granted <hi>in partibus,</hi> by Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like authority, it ſhall not bee granted to any but the Metropolitan, or his Vicar; or, in caſe hee bee ſuſpected, or farre diſtant, or the <hi>Appeale</hi> bee from him, it ſhall not bee granted but to a Biſhop dwelling neere, or a Biſhops

That the defendant appealing, ſhall bee bound to produce in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond inſtance the actes of the firſt, which ſhall beegiuen him, within thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dayes, without paying for them. That the Biſhop, or his Vicar generall may proceede againſt any to condemnation, and verball depoſition, and may alſo degrade ſolemnely, with the aſſiſtance of ſo many Abbats of Miter and poſtorals, if hee can haue them, or of ſo many other Eccleſiaſticall dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, as there are Biſhops required by the Canons. That the Biſhop as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate, may ſummarily take knowledge of the abſolution of euery one of whom inquiſition is made, and of the remiſſion of the puniſhment of euery one that is condemned by him; and if it ſhall appeare vnto him, that ſentence hath been obtained, by telling that which is falſe, or concealing the trueth, hee may cauſe it not to be executed. That a Biſhop may not bee cited to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare perſonally, but for ſuch a cauſe for which he may be depoſed or depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by what forme of iudgement ſoeuer the proceeding bee. That teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, in a criminall cauſe, againſt a Biſhop, may not bee receiued by informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by witneſſes, and thoſe of good fame, chaſtizing them grieuouſly if they ſhall depoſe vpon Paſſion: and the criminall cauſes of the Biſhops may not be determined but by the Pope.</p>
            <p>After this another Decree was publiſhed; in which the Synode ſayd, <note place="margin">The Decree concerning matters to be deferred vntill the comming of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> That, deſiring to extirpate all errours, it had handled foure Articles exactly. 1. Whether it were neceſſary and commanded by GOD, that all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhould receiue the Sacrament vnder both kindes. 2. Whether hee that receiueth but one, receiueth leſſe then he that receiueth both. 3. Whether the holy Church hath erred in communicating the Laiques with the bread onely, and the Prieſts who doe not celebrate. 4. Whether children ought to bee communicated. But becauſe the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> doe deſire to bee heard concerning theſe Articles, before the definition, and therefore haue demanded a Safe Conduct to come, remaine, ſpeake freely, propoſe and depart, the Synode, hoping to reduce them into the concord of one faith, hope, and charity, by yeelding to them, hath giuen them publique faith, that is, Safe Conduct, as farre as it can, according to the tenor vnder-written, and hath deferred to define theſe Articles, vntill the twenty fiue of Ianuary the next yeere; ordaining withall, that the Sacrifice of the Maſſe be handled in that Seſſion, as a thing annexed, and that in the next, the Sacraments of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and extreame Vnction, be diſcuſſed.</p>
            <p>The tenour of the Safe Conduct was; That the holy Synode doeth, as <note place="margin">The tenor of the Safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</note> much as it can, grant publike faith, full ſecurity, that is, Safe Conduct, with all neceſſary and fit clauſes, though they require a ſpeciall expreſſion, to all Eccleſiaſticall and Secular perſons of <hi>Germany,</hi> of what degree, ſtate, or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſoeuer, who will come to this generall Councell, that they may with all liberty, conferre, propoſe, treate, come, remaine, preſent Articles, by writing or by word, conferre with the Fathers deputed by the Synode, and diſpute without iniury and ill words, and depart when they pleaſe. And the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node is further pleaſed to grant, that if, for their greater liberty and ſecurity, they ſhall deſire, that Iudges bee deputed for the offences which they haue committed, or ſhall commit, though they be enormous, and ſauour of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, <note place="margin">The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Elector of <hi>Brandeburg.</hi>

                  </gap>achim,</hi> Elector of <hi>Brandeburg,</hi> was read, in the perſons of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stopher Straſſen,</hi> a Lawyer, and <hi>Iohn Oſman,</hi> his Ambaſſadours, ſent to the Councell. The former made a long Oration, ſhewing the good affection and reuerence of his Prince, towarde the Fathers, without declaring what his opinion was in point of Religion. The Synode anſwered, (that is, the Speaker in its name) that it heard with great content, the Ambaſſadours diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, eſpecially in that part, where that Prince doth ſubmit himſelfe to the Councell, and promiſeth to obſerue the Decrees, hoping that his deedes will be anſwerable to his wordes. But the Propoſition of thoſe of <hi>Brandeburg</hi> was noted by many, becauſe the Electour was of the <hi>Augustane</hi> confeſſion, and it was openly knowen, that his intereſts did mooue him to make ſuch a faire ſhew, that his ſonne <hi>Fredericke,</hi> elected Archbiſhop of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> by the Canons, a Benefice, vnto which a very great and rich principallitie is annexed, might not be hindered at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the Catholiques in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The anſwere which the Councel gaue, was much matueiled at, in regard <note place="margin">An artifice vſed by the Councel, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten practiſed by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> of the faire and aduantagious manner of contracting, pretending ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand by vertue of the promiſe, when the bargaine was but of ten. For there is no more proportion betweene theſe two numbers, then was betweene the reuerence promiſed by the Electour, and the obedience receiued by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node. It was replied for defence, that the Councell did not regard what was, but what ſhould haue been ſayd, and that this is an vſuall and pious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurement of the holy Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which yeelding to the infirmitie of her children, maketh ſhew to beleeue, that they haue performed their duetie. So the Fathers of the Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> writing to <hi>Innocentius</hi> the firſt, to giue him an account, that they had condemned <hi>Celestinus</hi> and <hi>Pelagius,</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to conforme himſelfe to their declaration; hee commended them in his anſwere, that, remembring the old Tradition, and Eccleſiaſticall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, they had referred all to his iudgement, whence all ought to learne, whom to abſolue, and whom to condemne. And indeed, this is a faire gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meanes, to make men ſpeake that in ſilence, which they will not in words. Afterwards, according to the intimation, made to the Abbat of <hi>Belloſana,</hi> to giue him then an anſwere to the Letters, and <hi>Proteſtation</hi> of his Maſter, they made the <hi>Apparitors</hi> demaund, by proclamation; at the Church doore, whether any were there for the moſt Chriſtian King. But no man appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, becauſe it was ſo concluded by the Kings Counſel, not to enter into the conteſtation of the cauſe, eſpecially for that they could expect no anſwere, but made at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Pope and the Spaniards, the ſpeaker did deſire, that the anſwere decreed, might be read publikely; and ſo it was, by conſent of the Preſidents. The ſubſtance of it was; That the Fathers conceiuing great hope of the fauours of the King, were exceedingly grieued for the <note place="margin">The anſwere of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell made to the Abbat of <hi>Belloſans.</hi>
               </note> words of his Miniſter, which did much abate it; yet they had not quite loſt it, in regard they were not conſcious of hauing giuen him any cauſe of offence: and, for that hee ſaid, the Councell was aſſembled for the profit of ſome fewe, and for priuate ends, it had no place in them, who were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, not by the preſent Pope onely, but by <hi>Paulus</hi> the third, to extirpate he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and reforme diſcipline, then which cauſes none can bee more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

And if his Miniſter, a priuate perſon, who brought vnto them things diſtaſtfull, was heard, with patience and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how much more welcome ſhall perſons be of ſo great dignitie. Adding withall, that though they come not, the Councell will not want reputation or authoritie, hauing been lawfully called, and for iuſt cauſes, reſtored. And, for that his Maieſtie did proteſt, to vſe the wonted remedies of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, the Synode had good hope, that hee would not reſtore the things long ſince abrogated, to the great benefit of that Crowne, but looking backe vpon his Anceſtors, on the name of the moſt Chriſtian King, and on his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Francis,</hi> who did honour that Synode, following that example, hee will not bee vnthankefull to GOD, and the Church his mother, but will rather pardon priuate offences, for publike cauſes.</p>
            <p>The Decrees of the Seſſion were immediatly printed; which, being curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly <note place="margin">The Decrees are cenſured in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </note> read in <hi>Germany,</hi> and elſe-where, raiſed much ſpeech in many things concerning the Euchariſt. Firſt, becauſe treating of the manner of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, it ſaid, that it could hardly be expreſſed in wordes, and yet affirmeth after, that it is properly called <hi>Tranſubstantiation;</hi> and, in another place, that it is a moſt fit terme: which beeing ſo, one cannot doubt but that it may bee properly expreſſed. It was further noted, that hauing declared that CHRIST, after the benediction of Bread and Wine, ſaid, that that which hee gaue, was his Body and Blood, it came to determine, againſt the opinion of all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, and of the whole Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the wordes of conſecration were not thoſe; that is, this is my body, becauſe it doth affirme that they were ſpoken after the conſecration. But to prooue that the body of our LORD is in the Euchariſt before the vſe becauſe CHRIST, in giuing of it, ſaid, before it was receiued by his Diſciples, it was his Body, did ſhew that they did preſuppoſe, that the giuing of it did not belong to the vſe; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary whereof was apparantly true. The manner of ſpeach vſed in the fifth point of doctrine, ſaying that diuine worſhip was due to the Sacrament, was noted alſo for improper, ſeeing it is certaine, that the thing ſignified or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, is not meant by the Sacrament, but the thing ſignifying and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: and therefore it was well corrected in the ſixt Canon, which ſaid, that the Sonne of GOD ought to bee worſhipped in the Sacrament. That alſo in the third <hi>Anathematiſme</hi> was noted, that all CHRIST was in euery part, after the ſeparation, becauſe it ſeemeth one may neceſſarily inferre from hence, that it was not in euery part before the diuiſion.</p>
            <p>The Prieſt complained of the reformation, and ſayd, that the Biſhops au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <note place="margin">The Prieſts complaine of the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> was made too great, and the Clergie brought into ſeruitude. But the Proteſtants ſeeing the point where it was ſaid, that they deſired to bee heard in foure Articles onely, did much wonder who ſhould make that requeſt in their name, ſeeing they had ſaid, and repeated ſo often, in publique Diets, and by publique writings, that they deſired a diſcuſſion of all the controuerſies, nor would receiue any of thoſe things which were already determined in <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants diſlike the reſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> points of doctrine.

               <hi>Trent,</hi> but would haue all to be reexamined. They thought alſo that the forme of the Safe Conduct was very captious, becauſe as well in the Decree to grant it, as in the tenour therof, there was this clauſe of reſeruation, as farre
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:17208:182"/>
as belogneth to the Synode: for no man demaundeth of another, but that which belongeth to him to graunt. But this affected diligence to expreſſe and repeat it, was a ſigne that they had inuented a meanes to goe againſt it, and to excuſe themſelues vpon others. And they doubted not but that the ayme of the Synode was to leaue a gate open for the Pope, that he might doe with his owne and the Councels honour, what hee thought ſeruiceable for them both. Beſides, the treating to depute Iudges for things hereticall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or to be committed, ſeemed to them a kinde of net, to catch thoſe that were vnwary; and euen the very Pedants did laugh at it, that the principall verbe was more then an hundred and fifty wordes diſtant from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The Proteſtants did vniformely agree not to bee content with it, or truſt vpon it, but to deſire another; iuſt like that which was giuen by the Councell of <hi>Baſill,</hi> to the <hi>Bohemians;</hi> which if it were granted, they did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine one great point, that is, that the controuerſies ſhould be decided by the holy Scripture, and if it were not granted, they might excuſe themſelues with the Emperour.</p>
            <p>The day following the Seſsion, there was a generall Congregation, to ſet downe how to treate of Penance and extreame Vnction, and to continue the reformation. It was conſidered, that the manner of diſcuſsion preſcribed, was exceeded by the Diuines, whence contentions did ariſe, for which they could not be vnited againſt the Lutherans: and therefore it was thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to renew the decree, &amp; not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In matter of faith twelue Articles were framed vpon the Sacrament of Penance, drawen <hi>Verbatim</hi> out of the booke of <hi>Martin,</hi> and of his Schoolers, to be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Diuines, whether they were to bee held for hereticall, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for ſuch; which, in framing the <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> after the Diuines had giuen their voyces, were ſo changed, that no iot of them remaining, it is ſuperfluous to recite them. To theſe Articles were added 4. more of extreame Vnction, anſwereable, in all points, to the ſoure <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> eſtabliſhed. In <note place="margin">Three De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees are made concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> the ſame page where the Articles were ſet downe, three Decrees were added.

That the order of ſpeaking ſhould be thus: that firſt they ſhould ſpeake who were ſent by the Pope: ſecondly, thoſe who were ſent by the Emperour: thirdly, thoſe of <hi>Louaine,</hi> ſent by the Queene: fourthly, thoſe Diuines who came with the Electors: fiftly, the Secular Clergie men, according to their promotions: ſixtly, the Regulars, according to their orders.

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:17208:182"/>
houre, vntill the ſeuenteenth, another in the afternoone from the twentieth houre vntill the three and twentieth. The Articles of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were in number fifteene, all which anſwered the points which were after eſtabliſhed, except the laſt; in which a propoſe was made, to conſtitute, that Benefices ſhould not be giuen in <hi>Commenda,</hi> but to perſons of the ſame age, which the law required in thoſe who might haue them in title: which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle when it was ſpoken of, was eaſily buried in ſilence, becauſe it hindered many Prelates to renounce their Benefices to their Nephewes.</p>
            <p>The Pope, who (as hath been ſaid) wrote letters to the Catholique Suiſſes, inuiting them to the Councell, did ſtill make the ſame inſtance vnto them, by his <hi>Nuncio, Ieronymus Francus,</hi> wherein alſo hee was aſſiſted by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.

            <p>In <hi>Trent</hi> the Congregations of the Diuines were diligently haſtened: who though they ſpake according to the order of the twelue Articles, yet all the matter of Penance was handled, not as the Schoole-men only, but alſo as the Canoniſts doe handle it, following <hi>Gratian,</hi> who maketh a queſtion thereof, diuided, for the length of it, into ſixe diſtinctions: and the manner preſcribed by the Preſidents, to deduce and prooue the concluſions from the <note place="margin">The manner of diſcuſſing the points of doctrine is cenſured.</note> fiue places aforeſaid, cauſed not prolixity, ſuperfluity, and vnprofitable and vaine queſtions to bee auoided, but gaue occaſion of greater abuſes. For when they ſpake Scholaſtically, they kept themſelues within the matter at the leaſt, and the diſcourſe was all ſerious and ſeuere. But in this new maner, which they call <hi>poſitiue</hi> (an Italian word, drawne from plaine apparell, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuperfluous ornaments) they ranne into fooleries. For, alleadging the Diuine Scripture, they brought all the places of the Prophets, and Pſalmes, eſpecially where the word, <hi>Confiteor,</hi> and, its verball, <hi>Confeſsia,</hi> are found; which doth ſignifie in the Hebrew, prayſe, or rather, religious profeſſion; and haled them to the Sacrament of Confeſſion: and, which was leſſe to the purpoſe, figures were drawen from the Olde Teſtament, to ſhew that it was prefigured, without any regard whether it might bee applied to it with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude; and hee was held moſt learned who brought moſt of them. All the rites ſignifying humility, griefe, and repentance, vſed by thoſe who confeſſed, were boldy called Apoſtolicall Traditions. Innumerable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were related, ancient and moderne, concerning things which ſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded well to thoſe who were deuoted to Confeſſion, and ill, to thoſe who were negligent, and deſpiſers of it. All the authorities alleadged by <hi>Gratian</hi> were often recited, but various and diuers ſences giuen them, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matter; and others alſo were added. And hee that ſhould haue heard thoſe Doctours ſpeake, could not but conclude, that the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:17208:183"/>
Apoſtles, and ancient Biſhops did neuer any thing but kneele at Confeſſion, or ſit to confeſſe others. In ſumme, that, to which all did come, and which was moſt to the purpoſe, was the Councell of <hi>Florence.</hi> Among the memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, there doth nothing appeare worthy of particular mention, except that which is to be ſpoken of when the ſubſtance of the doctrine muſt be recited. But thus much was neceſſary to be deliuered. Out of theſe ſheaues of diuers ſorts of corne, caried into the barne, it is no maruell if a mingled griſt were threſhed. The points of doctrine, by reaſon of the mixture, did abſolutly pleaſe but few; neither was it obſerued in this ſubiect, as in others, not to condemne any opinion of the Catholikes, but, where the opinions of the diuines were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, to make the expreſſion with ſuch a temper, that al parties might be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Which cauſeth me not to obſerue my former order, but firſt to expound the ſubſtance of the Decree, as it was eſtabliſhed to be read in the Seſſion, and then to adde that which the ſame perſons of the Councell did not approue.</p>
            <p>The Decree was this. That although, in handling <hi>Iuſtification,</hi> much <note place="margin">The Decree concerning <hi>Penance.</hi>
               </note> was ſpoken of the Sacrament of <hi>Penance,</hi> yet, to roote out diuers hereſies of this age, it was fitte to illuſtrate the Catholike trueth, which the holy Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node doth propoſe to bee perpetually obſerued, by all Chriſtians; adding that <hi>Penance</hi> was alwayes neceſſary, in euery age of the world, and, after CHRIST, to thoſe alſo who were to be baptized; which <hi>Penance</hi> is not a Sacrament. There is another inſtituted by CHRIST, when, breathing vpon his Diſciples, he gaue them the holy Ghoſt, to remitte and retaine ſinnes, that is, to reconcile the faithfull, fallen into ſinne after Baptiſme. For ſo the Church hath alwayes vnderſtood it; and the holy Synode doeth approoue this ſenſe of the wordes of our Lord, condemning thoſe who vnderſtand them of the power to preach the Goſpell. And this Sacrament differeth from <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> not onely in the matter and forme, but alſo becauſe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is not iudge, whereas, after <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> the ſinner doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelfe before the tribunall of the Prieſt, as guilty, to bee ſet at libertie, by his Sentence. And, by <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> a full remiſſion of ſinnes is receiued, which is not receiued by <hi>Penance,</hi> without ſighes and paines. And this Sacrament is an neceſſary for ſinners after <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> as <hi>Baptiſme</hi> it ſelfe is to him that hath not receiued it. But the forme thereof conſiſteth in theſe words of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; I doe abſolue thee: vnto which other prayers are laudably added, though they bee not neceſſary. And <hi>Contrition, Confeſsion,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> are, as it were, the matter of the Sacrament, which are therefore called parts of <hi>Penance.</hi> The thing ſignified, and the effect of the Sacrament, is, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, whence peace and cleareneſſe of conſcience do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ariſe. And therfore the Synod doth condemne thoſe who make horror of conſcience and faith to be parts of <hi>Penance. Contrition</hi> is griefe of minde for ſinne committed, with purpoſe to ſinne no more, and was euer neceſſary in all times; but in ſinners, after Baptiſme, it is a preparation to remiſſion of ſinnes, being ioyned with a purpoſe to doe whatſoeuer elſe is required, for the lawfull receiuing of this Sacrament. And it is not onely a ceaſing from ſinne, or a purpoſing and a beginning of a new life, but alſo an hate of the life paſt. And though <hi>Contrition</hi> be ſometimes ioyned with charity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileth a man to GOD, before the receiuing of the Sacrament, yet this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:17208:183"/>
cannot bee aſcribed to it, without purpoſe to receiue the ſaid Sacrament of <hi>Penance.</hi> But the action which ariſeth, either by reaſon of the filthineſſe of ſinne, or of the feare of puniſhment, with hope of pardon, is not hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, but the gift of GOD, by which the penitent beeing aſſiſted, doeth goe on to receiue Iuſtice; which although it cannot bring vs to iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation without the Sacrament, yet it doeth diſpoſe vs to obtaine grace from GOD, in the Sacrament of <hi>Penance.</hi> By this, the Church hath euer vnderſtood that CHRIST hath inſtituted the entire confeſſion of ſinnes as neceſſary, by the Law of GOD, to thoſe that fall after Baptiſme. For hauing inſtituted the Prieſts, his Vicars, for Iudges of all mortall ſinnes, it is certaine that they cannot exerciſe this iudgement, without knowledge of the cauſe, nor obſerue equitie in impoſing puniſhment, if the ſinnes bee not particularly made knowen vnto them, and not in generall onely. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the penitent ought in <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> to declare all his mortall ſinnes, euen the moſt ſecret, but the veniall, though they may be confeſſed, yet they may bee concealed alſo without offence. And hence it commeth, that, in <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> it is neceſſary to explicate the circumſtances, which alter the nature of the ſinne, becauſe otherwiſe, one cannot iudge of the weight of the exceſſes, and impoſe a condigne puniſhment. So that it is wickedeſſe to ſay, that this kinde of <hi>Confeſsion</hi> is impoſſible, or that it is the murdering of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, becauſe nothing is required but that the ſinner, hauing diligently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined himſelfe, ſhould confeſſe what hee remembreth, and the ſinnes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten are ſuppoſed to bee included in the ſame <hi>Confeſsion.</hi> And though CHRIST hath not forbid publique <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> yet he hath not commanded it; neither would it bee good to commaund that ſinnes, eſpecially ſecret, ſhould bee confeſſed in publique. Wherefore the Fathers, hauing euer pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Sacramental ſecret <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> the calumny of thoſe is vaine, who call it an humane inuention, excogitated by the <hi>Laterane</hi> Councell; which did not ordaine <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> but onely that it ſhould be made at the leaſt once eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry yeere. Concerning the Miniſter, the Synod doth declare thoſe doctrines to bee falſe, which extend to all the faithfull, the miniſtery of the keyes, and the authority giuen by CHRIST to binde and looſe, remit and retaine pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſinnes by correction, and ſecret by voluntary <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> and teacheth that the Prieſts, though ſinners, haue authority to remit ſinnes; which is not a naked miniſtery, to declare that ſinnes are remitted, but a iudiciall act. Therefore let no man ground himſelfe vpon faith, thinking that, without contrition, and a Prieſt, who is willing to abſolue him, hee can haue remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But becauſe there is a nullity in the ſentence, pronounced againſt him who is not ſubiect, there is alſo a nullity in the abſolution of the Prieſt, who hath not authority, delegate, or ordinary, ouer the penitent: and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Prieſts doe, with reaſon, reſerue to themſelues ſome faults more grieuous, and ſo doth the Pope very iuſtly; and there is no doubt, but that euery Biſhop may doe it in his Dioceſſe. And this reſeruation is not onely for externall policie, but is alſo of force before GOD. Therefore it was alwayes obſerued in the Church, that, in the houre of death, any Prieſt may abſolue any peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, from any ſinne. Of ſatisfaction the Synod doth declare, that the ſinne beeing remitted, the puniſhment is not pardoned, it beeing not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:17208:184"/>
that hee ſhould bee ſo eaſily receiued into Grace, who hath ſinned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Baptiſme and after, and bee left without a bridle, which may draw him from other ſinnes: yea it is conuenient hee ſhould bee like to CHRIST, who ſuffering puniſhments did ſatisfie for vs, from whom our ſatisfactions alſo receiue force, as offered by him to the Father, and receiued, by his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. Therefore the Prieſts ought to impoſe conuenient ſatisfactions, not onely to keepe the penitent from new ſinnes, but alſo to chaſtiſe him for the old: declaring likewiſe that Satisfaction is made, not onely by puniſhments, willingly receiued, or impoſed by the Prieſt, but by induring alſo, with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the ſcourges ſent from God.</p>
            <p>In conformitie of this doctrine, fifteene <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> were made. 1. <note place="margin">15. Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes.</note> Againſt him that ſhall ſay, that Penance is not truely and properly a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, inſtituted by CHRIST, to reconcile ſinners after Baptiſme. 2. That Baptiſme is Penance, or that is not the ſecond table or bord after ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke. 3. That the words of CHRIST, <hi>Quorum remiſeritis peccata,</hi> are not vnderſtood of the Sacrament of Penance, but of the authority to preach the Goſpel. 4. That <hi>Contrition, Confeſsion,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> are not required for, as it were, the matter, and as parts of <hi>Penance,</hi> or ſhall ſay that the terrors of conſcience and faith are parts. 5. That Contrition is not profitable, but cauſeth hypocriſie, and is a forced, and not a free ſorrow. 6. That Sacramentall <hi>Confeſsion</hi> is not inſtituted, and neceſſary by the law of GOD, or that the manner of confeſſing to the Prieſts in ſecret, is an humane inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 7. That it is not neceſſary to confeſſe all mortall ſinnes, euen thoſe that are hidden, and the circumſtances which doe change the nature of them. 8. That this is impoſſible, or that all are not bound to confeſſe once a yeere, according to the precept of the Laterane Councell. 9. That the Sacramentall abſolution is not a iudiciall act, but a miniſtery, to declare the remiſſion of ſinnes to the beleeuer, or that an abſolution giuen in ieſt doth helpe, or that the confeſſion of the penitent is not requiſite. 10. That Prieſts in mortall ſinne, haue not power to binde and looſe, or that all the faithfull haue it. 11. That Biſhops haue not authority to reſerue caſes, but for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall policy. 12. That all puniſhment is remitted together with the fault, and that no other ſatisfaction is required but faith, that CHRIST hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. 13. That <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is not made by ſuffering afflictions ſent by GOD, by puniſhments impoſed by the Prieſt, and willingly taken, and that the beſt <hi>Penance</hi> is onely a new life. 14. That <hi>Satisfactions</hi> are not diuine worſhip, but humane traditions. 15. That the keyes of the Church are onely to looſe, and not to binde.</p>
            <p>The Diuines of <hi>Louaine</hi> oppoſed the reſeruation of caſes, ſaying it was not <note place="margin">Some of which are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Dutines of <hi>Louaine</hi> and <hi>Collen.</hi>
               </note> ſo cleere, becauſe it cannot bee found that any Father did euer ſpeake of it; and that <hi>Durand,</hi> who was a <hi>Penitentiarie,</hi> and <hi>Gerſon</hi> and <hi>Caietan</hi> doe all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that not ſinnes, but cenſures are reſerued to the Pope: and therefore that it was too rigid, to eſteeme him an heretique who thought otherwiſe. The Diuines of <hi>Collen</hi> ioyned with them, and ſaid plainely, that it could not bee found that any Ancient did ſpeake of any reſeruations, but of publique ſinnes, and that it was not fit to condemne the Chancellour of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Catholique an Authour, who wrote againſt them. That the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:17208:184"/>
were wont to ſay, that theſe reſeruations were inuented for gaine; as alſo Card. <hi>Campeggio</hi> ſaid, in his reformation, and that it gaue him occaſion to write againſt it; vnto which the Diuines would not haue anſwered, nor been able to anſwere.</p>
            <p>And therefore as well the doctrine as the <hi>Canon,</hi> ought to bee moderated, that it may not giue ſcandall, nor offend any Catholike. The ſame men of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> ſaid, that the meaning of the words, <hi>Quorum ligaueritis,</hi> condemned in the tenth Canon, is expreſly, and formally ſo vnderſtood by <hi>Theophilact,</hi> and that to condemne it were to make the enemies reioyce. And that which was ſaid in the laſt, that the power to bind, is vnderſtood to impoſe <hi>Penance,</hi> they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued that the ancient Fathers did not ſo vnderſtand it, but that to binde was to make one abſtaine from receiuing the Sacraments, vntill a compleate ſatisfaction. They demanded alſo that mention ſhould bee made of publike Penance, ſo much commended by the Fathers, eſpecially by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Pope; who, in many Epiſtles, ſheweth it to bee neceſſary by the Law of God; which if it bee not brought againe into vſe concerning heretikes and publike ſinners, <hi>Germaine</hi> will neuer bee free: and yet the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, as well in the doctrine, as the Canons, doeth not onely not ſpeake in fauour of it, but rather doeth weaken it, and detract from it. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired alſo that ſome certaine externall ſigne ſhould be declared for the matter of the Sacrament, for otherwiſe the obiection of the aduerſaries will neuer bee anſwered.</p>
            <p>Two things did exceedingly diſpleaſe the Franciſcan Diuines: the one <note place="margin">And others by the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſcans and by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </note> for hauing declared Contrition, Confeſſion, and Satisfaction to bee the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sacrament, holding them to be neceſſary requiſites, but not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts of Penance. They ſayd it was plaine, that the matter ſhould bee a thing applied to the receiuer, by the Miniſter; and not an operation of the receiuer himſelfe. That this appeareth in all Sacraments; and therefore that it is a great inconuenience to put the actes of the Penitent for part of the Sacrament. That it is certaine that Contrition is no leſſe required to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, then it is to Penance; and yet it is not put for part of Baptiſme. That the ancients did require confeſſion of ſinnes before Baptiſme, as alſo Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> did of thoſe whom he baptized, and they made thoſe that were Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed to ſtand in Penance; and yet neuer any ſaid, that theſe were parts or matters of Baptiſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore to condemne this opinion, held by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Diuines of the Franciſcan religion, and now by the whole Schoole of <hi>Paris,</hi> was to paſſe their limits. They complained alſo that it was made he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie to ſay, that ſacramentall Abſolution is declaratiue, becauſe Saint <hi>Ierom,</hi> the Maſter of the Sentences, S. <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> and almoſt all the Schoole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines haue cleerely ſayd, that the Abſolution in the Sacrament of Penance, is a declaration that one is abſolued. To this laſt, anſwere was made, that hee was not abſolutely condemned for an heretike, who ſaid that Abſolution is a declaration that ſinnes are remitted but that ſinnes are remitted to him that doeth certainely beleeue that they are remitted to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore onely the opinion of <hi>Luther</hi> was comprehended. But they were not ſo ſatisfied, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that, in handling of hereſie, one ſhould ſpeake plainely and that no man would make ſuch an expoſition of it: and they demanded, that, as well in the
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:17208:185"/>
point of doctrine, as in the <hi>Anathematiſme,</hi> this particular ſhould bee well declared. But Friar <hi>Ambroſius Pelargus,</hi> a Diuine of the Elector of <hi>Triers,</hi> conſidered, that the words of our Lord, <hi>Quorum remiſeritis,</hi> were perhaps not expounded by any Father, for an inſtitution of the Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and that by ſome they were vnderſtood of Baptiſme, by others, of any other thing, by which pardon of ſinnes is receiued. Therefore to reſtraine them onely to the Sacrament of Penance, and to declare them heretikes who vnderſtand them otherwiſe, would giue a great aduantage to the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and cauſe them to ſay, that the ancient doctrine of the Church was condemned in the Councell. Therefore hee exhorted them, before they made ſuch a great ſtride, to looke vpon the expoſitions of the Fathers, and, when thoſe were examined, to determine what ſhould be ſayd. Many of the Fathers thought the remonſtrances to be very conſiderable, &amp; deſired that the Deputies would conſultagaine, as they had done before, vpon other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, to remooue whatſoeuer gaue offence to any, and ſo to frame the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, as that euery one might approoue it.</p>
            <p>But Cardinall <hi>Creſcentius</hi> oppoſed with a continuate ſpeach, ſhewing that <note place="margin">But all of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </note> to take the ſinewes and ſoule from the Decrees, to ſatisfie the humours of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men, was not honourable for the Synode. That they were mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhed, and therefore it was fit to obſerue them. Yet, if his opinion did not pleaſe all, hee was content, that, before any thing elſe were done, this generall ſhould bee handled in a Congregation, whether it were good to make a change or not, and then to deſcend to the particulars. But in this hee did not fully diſcouer what his aime was, which afterwards hee did manifeſt to his Colleagues, and truſtie friends: that they ſhould not ſuffer the vſe of contending and ſpeaking ſo freely; which would bee dangerous when the Proteſtants came, becauſe they would doe as much, in fauour of their owne opinions. That, for the honeſt and reaſonable libertie of the Councell, it ſufficeth that one may deliuer his opinion, while the matter is diſputed; but after, when all men haue beene heard, the Decrees framed by the Doputies, allowed by the Preſidents, ſeene, examined, and approoued at <hi>Rome,</hi> to call them into queſtion, and to require an alteration, for particular intereſts, was too much licence. The Cardinall ouercame, at the laſt, the maior part of the Fathers, being perſwaded that the doctrine eſtabliſhed was according to the opinion of the moſt intelligent Diuines, and moſt oppoſite to the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran nouities.</p>
            <p>But becauſe almoſt all is ſpoken that concerneth matter of faith, in that Seſſion, it will not bee amiſſe to adde that little which remaineth, touching the Sacrament of extreame Vnction. Of which the Diuines ſpake with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:17208:185"/>
holy Ghoſt, which purifieth the reliques of ſinne, and rayſeth vp the minde of the ſicke, and ſometimes, when it is profitable for the ſoule, giueth health of body. The miniſters of the Sacramentare the Prieſts of the Church, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> being not vnderſtood for ancients, but for Prieſts. And this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> ought principally to be giuen to thoſe who are at the point of death, who, being recouered, and returned to the ſtate of ſickeneſſe, may receiue it againe. And therefore an <hi>Anathema</hi> is pronounced. 1. Againſt him that ſhall ſay that extreame <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> is not truely and properly a Sacrament, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by CHRIST. 2. That it doeth not giue grace, nor remit ſinnes, nor caſe the ſicke, but is ceaſed, as that which did formerly belong to the grace of health. 3. That the rite vſed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is contrary to the ſaying of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and may bee neglected without ſinne. 4. That the Prieſt onely is not the miniſter, and that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> did vnderſtand the ancients for age, and not the Prieſts, ordained by the Biſhop.</p>
            <p>But if any maruaile why it is ſaid in the firſt head of the doctrine, that <note place="margin">14. Articles of reformation are handled, in which the Preſidents of the Synod &amp; the Biſhops haue diuers ends.</note> this Sacrament is inſinuated by CHRIST our Lord in Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> whereas the antecedence, and conſequence of the words did require, that it ſhould not bee ſayd, inſinuated, but inſtituted, hee may know that it was firſt ſo written; but a Diuine hauing obſerued, that the Apoſtles, who anoynted the ſicke, of whom Saint <hi>Marke</hi> ſpeaketh, were not Prieſts, becauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holdeth, that Prieſthood was conferred vpon them onely in the laſt Supper, it ſeemed a contradiction, to affirme, that the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> which they gaue, was a Sacrament, and that Prieſts onely are miniſters of it. Whereunto ſome, who held it to bee a Sacrament, and at that time inſtituted by CHRIST, did anſwere, that CHRIST command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to miniſter the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction,</hi> made them Prieſts concerning that acte onely. As if the Pope ſhould command a ſimple Prieſt to giue the Sacrament of <hi>Chriſme,</hi> he made him a Biſhop for that acte. Yet it was thought too dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to affirme it abſolutely. Therefore, in ſtead of the word <hi>Inſtitutum,</hi> they put <hi>Inſinuatum.</hi> Which word what it may ſignifie in ſuch a matter, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one may iudge who vnderſtandeth what <hi>Inſinuare</hi> is, and doeth apply it to that which the Apoſtles then did, and to that which was commanded by Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and to the determination made by this Councell.</p>
            <p>But in matter of reformation, as hath beene ſaid, fourteene Articles were propoſed, all belonging to Epiſcopall iuriſdiction: whereof when they had vnderſtood the opinion of the Canoniſts in the particular Congregations, and read all in the generall, they came to frame the Decree. Herein the ayme of the B B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was to increaſe their authority, &amp; to recouer that which the Pope had vſurped from them, and of the Preſidents, to grant as little as they could. But both parties did proceede cunningly, and made ſhew to regard onely the ſeruice of God, and the reſtitution of the ancient Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline. The Biſhops thought they were hindered in executing their office. For when they did ſuſpend any from exerciſe of their orders, or Eccleſiaſticall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and dignities, for cauſes knowen to themſelues, or did refuſe to let them paſſe to higher degrees, all was retracted, by a Licence or Diſpenſation gotten at <hi>Rome:</hi> which cauſed a diſreputation of the Biſhops, damnation of ſoules, and a totall ruine of diſcipline. Concerning this, the firſt head was
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:17208:186"/>
made, that ſuch Licences and Reſtitutions ſhould not bee offorce. But the Preſident for the honour of the Apoſtolique Sea, would not haue the Pope named, nor the chiefe <hi>Penitentiarie,</hi> nor any miniſters of the Court, from whom ſuch Licences were wont to bee obtained. The titular Biſhops did alſo hinder them; who beeing depriued, by a Decree publiſhed in the ſixt Seſſion, of power to exerciſe the pontificall office in the Dioceſſes without leaue of the proper Biſhop, did retire themſelues, into a place exempt from all Biſhopriques, admitting thoſe to holy orders who were before reiected, as vnfit, by their owne Biſhops; which they did, by vertue of a priuiledge to ordaine any that offered himſelfe vnto them. This was prohibited in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond head, but with this moderation, that, for reuerence of the Apoſtolike Sea, mention ſhould not bee made, who granted the priuiledge. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the third head, power was giuen to the Biſhops to ſuſpend, for what time they pleaſed, any one ordained without their examination, or with licence, by facultie giuen by whomſoeuer. Theſe things the wiſer ſort of Biſhops knew to bee of ſmall weight, becauſe the Canoniſts doe hold that <note place="margin">344</note> Licences, Priuiledges, and Faculties granted by the Pope, are neuer compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in generall words, without ſpeciall mention bee made of them. But not beeing able to obtaine more, they were content with this, hoping that time might open them a way to proceede further.</p>
            <p>It was alſo decreed in the ſame ſixth Seſſion, that no ſecular Clerke, by vertue of perſonall Priuiledge, nor Regular, dwelling out of the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by vigor of the Priuiledge of his order, ſhould bee exempt from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Biſhoppe, as Delegate of the Apoſtolike Sea. Which ſome thinking not to containe the Canons of Cathedrall Churches, and other Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate dignities, who, not by priuiledge, but by ancient cuſtome, or by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences put in execution, or by Concordates with the Biſhops eſtabliſhed and ſworne, were in poſſeſſion of not beeing ſubiect to Biſhops, and others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reſtraining it onely to viſitation, it was ordained in the fourth head, that, concerning ſecular Clerkes, it ſhould bee extended to all times, and all ſorts of exceſſes, and declared that none of the things aforeſayd ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            <p>Another diſorder as great did ariſe, becauſe the Pope did grant a Iudge, at the election of the ſupplicant, to whoſoeuer did ſeeke it by the ordinary meanes vſed in Court, with authoritie to defend, protect, and maintaine him in poſſeſſion of his rights, and to remooue the moleſtation giuen him, extending alſo this fauour to all his domeſtiques. And this ſort of Iudges were called <hi>Conſeruators;</hi> who did ſtretch their authoritie, in place of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſupplicant from moleſtations, to withdraw him from iuſt correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and alſo, at their inſtance, to moleſt and trouble the Biſhops, and other ordinary Eccleſiaſticall ſuperiours, with cenſures. The fifth point made prouiſion againſt this diſorder, ordaining that <hi>Conſeruatorie graces</hi> ſhould not helpe any body, nor free him from inquiſition, accuſation, and conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before the Ordinary, in criminall and mixt cauſes, and in ciuill alſo, in which hee is plaintife: and, in other cauſes, if the <hi>Conſeruator</hi> bee ſuſpected, or difficultie ariſe betweene him and the Ordinary, who is competent Iudge, that arbitrators ſhall bee choſen, according to the forme of the Law, and
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:17208:186"/>
that Conſeruatory letters which comprehend domeſtiques, ſhall bee exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but vnto two, who doe liue at the charge of the Maſter of the familie, and that theſe and the like <hi>graces</hi> ſhall not continue aboue fiue yeeres, and that the <hi>Conſeruators</hi> ſhall not haue Tribunals. But the Synod did not meane to containe in this Decree Vniuerſities, Colledges of Doctours, and Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, places of Regulars, and Hoſpitals. Concerning which exception, when this point was handled, there was very great contention, it ſeeming to the Biſhops, that, againſt all right, the exception was larger then the rule, becauſe the number of Doctors, Schollers, Regulars, and Hoſpitalaries, is greater then of all others, who can haue <hi>Conſeruatorie</hi> letters, and that the prouiſion againſt any particular man was eaſie, but the diſorders of Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities and Colledges, were of the greateſt importance. The Legate gaue an account heereof to <hi>Rome:</hi> where it beeing decided, by that which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted vnder <hi>Paul</hi> the third, that it was neceſſary, for maintenance of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique Sea, that the Friars, and Vniuerſities, ſhould totally depend on <hi>Rome,</hi> there was no neede of a new determination: and immediatly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere was made, that the <hi>Conſeruatories</hi> of theſe, ſhould, by no meanes, bee touched. Whereupon the Fathers of the Synode, who were adherents of <hi>Rome,</hi> beeing entred into this opinion, the others, who were fewer, were forced to be content with the exception, and there was ſome hope, and ſome meanes vſed to pacifie them.</p>
            <p>The ſixth point was concerning the Prieſts apparell: wherein it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily concluded to ordaine, that all the Eccleſiaſtiques of holy Order, or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficed men, ſhould bee bound to weare an habite fit for their degree, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the appointment of the Biſhop, giuing him power to ſuſpend the tranſgreſſours, if, after admonition, they ſhall not obey, and to depriue them of their Benefices, if, after correction, they ſhall not amend; renewing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the conſtitution of the Councel of <hi>Vienna;</hi> which notwithſtanding was not much fitted to thoſe times, prohibiting vpper garments laced, and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers colours, and frockes ſhorter then the veſtment, and red and greene bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches chequered, things diſuſed, which haue no neede of prohibition.</p>
            <p>The vſe of all Chriſtian Nations was moſt ancient, that, to imitate the mildeneſſe of CHRIST our LORD, all the Miniſters of the Church ſhould bee neat and cleane from mans blood, neuer receiuing to any Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall order, any perſon defiled with homicide, whether voluntary or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall: and, if any Clerke committed any ſuch exceſſe, either willingly or by chance, all Eccleſiaſticall function was immediatly taken from him. This hath beene, and is now, inuiolably obſerued by other Chriſtian Nations, vnto whom diſpenſations againſt the Canons are vnknowen; but in the Latine, where rich men may eaſily make vſe of them, it is obſerued onely by the poorer ſort. It being propoſed in the fourth and fifth Article to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the abuſe, it was ordained in the ſeuenth head, that a voluntary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide ſhould for euer remaine depriued of all Order, Benefice, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall office; and when there ſhall bee cauſe to diſpence with the caſuall homicide, the commiſſion of the diſpenſation, ſhall bee directed to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop onely, or, if there bee cauſe to the contrary, to the Metropolitane, or next Biſhop. They ſaw that this Decree, did not ſerue to moderate the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:17208:187"/>
abuſes, but to make the diſpenſations dearer. For the Popes hands, were not tied concerning voluntary homicide; and for caſuall, the decree was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, in not committing the cauſe to any but the Biſhop, but to diſpence di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, without committing it to another, was not taken away, firſt making the proofes in <hi>Rome,</hi> or diſpatching the diſpenſations vnder the name of <hi>Motu proprio,</hi> or with other clauſes, with which the Chancery doth abound, when it hath cauſe to vſe them.</p>
            <p>A certaine ſort of Prelates ſeemed to hinder much the authority of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who, for their reputation, in the place where they dwelt, obteined pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Pope, to puniſh the faults of the Eccleſiaſtiques of that place; and ſome Biſhops alſo, pretending that their Prieſts receiued ſcandall and bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from thoſe of the next Dioceſſes, obtained authority to chaſtiſe them. Some deſiring that this diſorder ſhould bee remedied, by reuoking wholly ſuch authorities, and perceiuing that it would diſtaſte many Cardinals, and great Prelates, who abuſed them, they found a moderation, that they ſhould vſe them, yet without preiudice of the Biſhop, ordayning in the eighth poynt, that they might not proceede but in preſence of the Biſhop, or his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie. There was another way to ſubiect the Churches and people of one Dioceſſe, to the Biſhop of another, by vniting the Churches of one, to the Churches or Benefices of the other: which though it were prohibited in generall termes, in the ſeuenth Seſſion, yet it beeing not ſo plainely done as ſome deſired, an expreſſe declaration was demanded. Whereupon it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued in the ninth point, that all perpetuall <hi>vnions</hi> of the Churches of one Dioceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, to the Churches of another, ſhould be prohibited, vnder what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſoeuer.</p>
            <p>The Regulars made great inſtance to keepe their Benefices, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine thoſe which they had already loſt, by the inuention of perpetuall <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendaes;</hi> and many Biſhops, for ſundry reſpects, were willing to aſſiſt them. They were deſirous to propoſe, that theſe perpetuall <hi>Commendaes</hi> ſhould bee quite taken away; but, fearing to bee contradicted, they were content onely to deſire they ſhould bee moderated. The Preſidents, on the other ſide, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hazard, that this matter, dangerous for the Court, ſhould bee ſet on foote, themſelues propoſed a light remedie, to hinder all treatie of a better. And this was, that Regular Benefices, vſually giuen in title to religious men, when they ſhall bee vacant hereafter, ſhall not bee conferred but vpon men profeſſed of that Order, or to ſome perſon who is to receiue the habite, and take vpon him the profeſſion. This was the tenth poynt, which did not much import the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> in regard as many <hi>Commendaes</hi> were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die made as could bee; and the Prelates had no great deſire to obtaine more, though it would haue beene an honour for the Churches, if the regular Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats had reſided. But, in regard of the fauour extended to the Monkes, not to take more from them then was taken already, a counterpoize was added in the next point, ordaining that they could not haue ſecular Benefices, though with cure. Which howſoeuer it ſpeaketh onely of thoſe who are tranſlated from one order to another, ordaining that none ſhould bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but with condition to remaine in the Cloyſter, yet by parity of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or by an argument of greater reaſon, it hath beene vnderſtood generally
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:17208:187"/>
of all. And becauſe the patronage of Churches, was graunted in Court by <hi>grace,</hi> and to make the <hi>grace</hi> the greater, power giuen to depute an Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall perſon, with faculty to inſtitute him that is preſented; this diſorder was remedied in the twelfth head, ordaining that none ſhould haue right of Patronage, but the founded of the Church, or hee that hath competenly indowed, with his patrimoniall goods, one already founded. And for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of the ſecond diſorder, it was forbid in the 13. head, that the Patrone, though he had a priuiledge to doe it, ſhould not make the preſentation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but the Biſhop.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were handled, <hi>Iohannes Theodoricus Pleniagorus,</hi> and <note place="margin">The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of the Duke of <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenberg</hi> arriue in <hi>Trent,</hi> with commiſſion to preſent the confeſſion of their faith.</note> 
               <hi>Iohannes Eclinus,</hi> Ambaſſadours, ſent by the Duke of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, arriued in <hi>Trent,</hi> with order to preſent publiquely the confeſſion of their doctrine, whereof mention hath beene made, and to ſay withall, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines would come to expound it more at large, and defend it, if ſecuritie and ſafe conduct were giuen them, according to the forme of the Councell of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil.</hi> They went to the Count <hi>Montfort,</hi> the Emperours Ambaſſadour, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him their <hi>Mandate,</hi> and tolde him they had commiſsion to propoſe ſome things in the Councell. This being related by the Count to the Legate, hee anſwered, that as others Ambaſſadors did firſt preſent themſelues to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents in the name of the Pope, and did ſignifie to them the ſumme of their Ambaſſage, ſo thoſe of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> ought to doe: hee therefore wiſhed they <note place="margin">Whereof the Legat giueth an account to Rome.</note> ſhould come, and promiſed to receiue them with all humanity. The Count related the anſwere; wherewith the Ambaſſadours were not contented, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That it was one of the points required in <hi>Germany,</hi> that the Pope ſhould not preſide; which not beeing willing to contradict, without order from their Prince, they would write; and expect an anſwere. The Count did cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly aſſay to learne the whole ſecret of their inſtructions, to aduertiſe the Legate of it. But they ſtood vpon generall termes, and would not ſpecifie any particular. The Legate ſent immediately aduiſe hereof to <hi>Rome,</hi> deſiring to know what hee ſhould doe, and the rather, becauſe he vnderſtood that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would come alſo.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of Nouember, the Emperour, to bee neere the Councel, <note place="margin">The Emperor goeth to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pruc,</hi> diſtant from the Councel but three dayes iourney.</note> and the warre of <hi>Parma,</hi> went to <hi>Iſpruc,</hi> diſtant but three dayes iourney from <hi>Trent,</hi> the way being ſo commodious, that if there were occaſion, hee might heare from his Ambaſſadours in one day. The Pope had newes at once of the arriuall of the Emperour, and of thoſe of <hi>Wittenberg.</hi> And although hee truſted vpon the Emperours promiſes made to him before the conuocation of the Councell, and often reiterated, and ſaw the effects, becauſe his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours curbed the Spaniards, when they were too bold in maintaining the Epiſcopall authoritie, and was perſwaded he would perſeuere, in regard of their common intereſts againſt the French King, yet hauing heard of <note place="margin">Which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Pope ſomwhat iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of him,</note> ſome things handled in <hi>Germany,</hi> hee was a little iealous, that, either for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie, or for ſome great opportunitie, which occurrences might bring, hee would change his opinion. Yet he tooke courage; conſidering, that if there were warre in <hi>Germany,</hi> no account would be held of the Councell, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring peace, all the <hi>German</hi> Eccleſiaſtiques would bee on his ſide, as alſo the <hi>Italian</hi> Prelates; whoſe number hee could eaſily encreaſe by ſending thither
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:17208:188"/>
all thoſe of the Court: that the Legat being reſolute, and hoping to be Pope, would labour as for himſelfe, and that the <hi>Nuncio</hi> of <hi>Siponto</hi> was moſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate to his perſon: that he might at any time be reconciled with <hi>France,</hi> becauſe it was deſired by that King, by meanes of whom, and with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of his kingdome, hee might withſtand all attempts made againſt his authoritie.</p>
            <p>He anſwered the Legate, that hee could giue him but little inſtruction more; that he was not onely acquainted with, but principall Author of the <note place="margin">The anſwere of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe made to the Legate.</note> Treaties made in framing the Bull of the Conuocation, that hee ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the things decreed vnder <hi>Paul,</hi> were ſtudiouſly approoued therein; that it was ſayd that it did belong to the Pope, not onely to call, but alſo to direct Councels, and to preſide by his miniſters, and that hee ſhould not leaue open ſo much as a little chinke, in preiudice of any of theſe. For the reſt he ſhould gouerne himſelfe according to occaſions, putting him in mind to fly, as the Plague, all middle counſels, and moderations, when any of theſe were handled, but ſo ſoone as the difficultie did ariſe, to breake it off ſuddenly, that the aduerſaries might not haue time to looke farre into it. That he would not lay on his ſhoulders the <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> or diſſolution of the Councell, but onely that he ſhould ſpeedily aduertiſe when hee ſaw cauſe. Furthermore, that he ſhould ſet on foot as much matter of doctrine as he could, which would worke many good effects. For it would make the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans deſpaire of concord without their totall ſubmiſſion, would intereſt the Prelates more againſt them, would not giue time to theſe to thinke on the point of reformation, and make a ſudden diſpatch of the Councel, a matter of the greateſt importance, becauſe there is danger of ſome inconuenience ſo long as it laſteth. And when he ſaw himſelfe forced to giue them ſome ſatisfaction, in amplifying the Epiſcopall authoritie, hee ſhould condeſcend, and yet hold backe as much as might bee. For in caſe ſome thing ſhould bee granted preiudiciall to the Court, as formerly hath beene done, yet ſo long as the Popes authoritie remaineth intire, there will bee meanes to reduce them eaſily to their firſt ſtate.</p>
            <p>Things ſtanding thus, the 25. of Nouember, the day appointed for the <note place="margin">The Seſſion of the 25 of Nouember.</note> Seſſion, came. The Fathers met, and went to Church in the vſuall order: where the ceremonies being finiſhed, the doctrine of faith, the <hi>Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes,</hi> &amp; decree of the <hi>Reformation</hi> were read by the Biſhop that ſaid Maſſe. The tenour whereof being already recited, there remaineth nothing elſe to be ſpoken. And finally, the laſt decree was read, to giue order for the future Seſſion; in which it was ſayd, that it being already appointed for the 25. of Ianuary, the Sacrament of Order ought then to bee handled, together with the Sacrifice of the Maſſe. So the Legate would haue it pronounced, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Popes opinion, they might haue matter of doctrine enough whereon to treat. The Seſſion being ended, the Legate vſed all diligence that the Decrees might not be printed. And his order was obſerued at <hi>Ripa,</hi>

That which was decided in the firſt point of doctrin, and the ſixt Canon, cauſed much ſpeech: that is, that CHRIST, when hee breathed on his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and gaue them the holy Ghoſt, ſaying, <hi>Whoſe ſinnes you remit they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and whoſe ſinnes you retaine, they are retained,</hi> did inſtitute the Sacrament of <hi>

               </gap> which was to come, and finally by CHRIST, in expreſſe and <note place="margin">And there cenſured.</note> plaine words, inſtituted a Sacrament, for remiſſion of ſinnes, and an entrance into the Church: ordaining it ſhould bee miniſtred in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt. Likewiſe in the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon</hi> a <hi>Poſtce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> was inſtituted by the Iewes, with bread and wine, for a thankes giuing and a memoriall of their going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> while being out of the land of promiſe, they could not eat the Paſchal Lambe: in imitation of which rite CHRIST inſtiruted the Euchariſt, to giue thankes to GOD, for the generall deliuerance of mankind, and in memorie of himſelfe, who was the Author thereof, by the ſprinkling of his blood. And howſoeuer like rites haue beene formerly vſed, though for other ends, as hath beene ſaid, yet the Scripture doth expreſſe all the ſingularities of them. Now that CHRIST would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a rite to confeſſe our ſinnes in particular ſo exactly, as that no vſe was euer the like, it ſeemed ſtrange that hee would bee vnderſtood by words, from which it muſt bee drawne by a very vnioynted conſequence, yea by many conſequences, very farre fetcht, as was done by the Councell. And they wondred, why the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being made by the word <hi>remitto,</hi> the forme was not, <hi>I remit thy ſinnes,</hi> rather then <hi>Iabſolue thee.</hi> Others added, that if, by thoſe words, a Sacrament of abſolution is inſtituted, with this forme; <hi>Abſoluo te:</hi> by which one is abſolued, one muſt ſay, by an vnreſiſtable neceſſitie, that another, or the ſame, is inſtituted, in which, this forme ſhould likewiſe be, <hi>Ligo te:</hi> becauſe it cannot be vnderſtood how the ſame authoritie <hi>to looſe and binde,</hi> founded vpon the words of CHRIST abſolutely alike, doth require in abſolution the pronouncing of the wordes, <hi>Abſoluo te,</hi> and that other of binding doth not require the pronouncing of the words, <hi>Ligo te:</hi> Nor by what reaſon, to execute that which CHRIST hath ſaid, <hi>Quorum retinueritis, &amp;c. &amp; quaecunqne ligaueritis &amp;c.</hi> it is not neceſſary to ſay, <hi>Ligo te,</hi> but to execute <hi>Quorum remiſeritis, &amp; quaecunque ſolueritis,</hi> it is neceſſary to ſay, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluo te.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe the doctrine, inferred in the fifteeneth point, was cenſured by critiques: where it is ſaide, that CHRIST by the ſame words, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the Prieſts, iudges of ſinnes, and therefore that it is neceſſarie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them all abſolutely, and in particular, together with the circumſtances which alter the kinde, ſeeing that it doeth appeare by the words of our Lord, that he hath not diſtinguiſhed two ſorts of ſinnes, one to bee remitted, and the other to be retained, whereby it would bee neceſſarie to know of which the delinquent is guiltie, but one onely which doeth comprehend all, and therefore the word <hi>Peccata</hi> in generall is onely vſed. But hee hath diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed two ſortes of ſinners, ſaying, <hi>Quorum, &amp; Quorum:</hi> one of the Penitent, vnto whom remiſſion is granted, another of the obſtinate; vnto whom it is denyed. Therefore they are rather to know the ſtate of the delinquent,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:17208:189"/>
then the nature and number of the ſinnes. But concerning the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which alter the kinde it was ſaid, that euery honeſt man may ſweare, with a good conſcience, that the holy Apoſtles, and their diſciples, moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in things celeſtiall, not regarding humane ſubtilties, did neuer knowe what were the circumſtances which alter the kinde, and perhaps if <hi>Aristotle</hi> had not made this ſpeculation, the worlde would not haue knowen it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till now, and yet there is made of it an Article of Faith, neceſſary to ſaluation. But as it was approoued, that <hi>Abſoluo,</hi> was a iudiciall word, and reputed a good conſequence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if the Prieſts doe abſolue, they are Iudges, ſo it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be an inconſtancie, to condemne thoſe who ſay, it is a naked miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to pronounce; it being plaine, that the office of a Iudge is nothing but to pronounce him innocent who is ſo, and the tranſgreſſor guiltie, and that this metaphore of the Iudge doth not beare, that the Prieſt can make a iuſt man of a delinquent, as is aſcribed to him. The Prince may pard on offenders, and reſtore them to their good name; to whom, hee that maketh a wicked man iuſt, is more like, then to a Iudge, who doeth euer tranſgreſſe his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, when hee pronounceth any thing but that which hee firſt findeth to be true. But they were amazed moſt of all, when they read the poynt where the ſpecificall and ſingular confeſſion of ſinnes, with the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is prooued; becauſe the iudicature cannot bee executed without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the cauſe, nor equitie obſerued in impoſing puniſhment, if the faults be knowen onely in general, and afterwards that CHRIST hath commanded this confeſſion, that they may impoſe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>digne puniſhment. They ſaid that this was plainely to mock the world, and think all men fooles, &amp; to perſwade themſelues that all their abſurdities ſhould be beleeued, without more to doe. For who knoweth not, and ſeeth not dayly, that the <hi>Confesſors</hi> enioyne <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> not onely without weighing the merit of the faults, but without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the leaſt conſideration of them. It would ſeeme conſidering the words of the Councell, that the <hi>Confeſſors</hi> ſhould haue a balance, to make difference of euery graine; and yet oftentimes to recite fiue <hi>Pater noſters,</hi> ſhall bee a <hi>Penance,</hi> for many murders, adulteries, and thefts: and the moſt learned <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi> and generally all in giuing <hi>Penance,</hi> doe ſay to euery man, that they doe impoſe onely part of the <hi>Penance.</hi> Therefore it is not neceſſarie to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that exact <hi>Penance</hi> which the faults doe deſerue, nor to haue a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar enumeration made of the ſinnes and circumſtances. But what neede one goe ſo farre, when the ſame Councell, in the ninth point of the doctrine, and the thirteenth <hi>Anathematiſme,</hi> doth ordaine, that ſatisfaction is made by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Penance,</hi> and ſuffering of aduerſities. Therefore it is not needefull, yea not iuſt, to impoſe in <hi>Confeſſion</hi> the puniſhment that is correſpondent, and, by conſequence, not to make a ſpecificall enumeration, which is ſayd to bee ordained for this ende. And they added, that, not conſidering any thing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before the <hi>Confeſsor,</hi> though moſt learned, attentiue, and wiſe, hauing heard the <hi>Confesſion</hi> of an ordinary man, for one yeere, much more of a great ſinner, for many yeeres, it is impoſſible hee ſhould iudge aright, though hee had Canons of the puniſhment due to any ſinne whatſoeuer, without danger to erre more then halfe, to ſpeake the leaſt. For a <hi>Confeſſor</hi> ſeeing all in writing, and conſidering many dayes of it, could not make a balance to
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:17208:189"/>
decide iuſtly, much leſſe hearing, and reſoluing preſently, as the cuſtome is. They ſaid it was not fit they ſhould be ſo contemned, &amp; held ſo inſenſible, as to beleeue ſuch abſurdities. Of the <hi>reſeruation</hi> of <hi>Caſes</hi> enough was ſaid by the Diuines of <hi>Louine,</hi> and <hi>Collen,</hi> which was attributed to a deſire of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and to auarice.</p>
            <p>The next day there was a generall Congregation, to giue order for the <note place="margin">The Sacrifice of the Maſſe, the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Cup, and of children are handled.</note> diſcuſſion of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and the <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Cup,</hi> and of Children. And although the Decrees were already made, for the Seſſion of the eleuenth of October, and deferred, yet they diſcourſed againe, as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had beene ſayd, and did chooſe Fathers to collect the Articles to bee diſputed on, and others to make the Decree. And becauſe they made haſt, ſeuen Articles were ſuddenly framed, whereon they diſputed, twiſe euery day in which number was the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Namburg,</hi> and for greater reputation, the Electour of <hi>Collen,</hi> that all that doctrine might ſeeme to come from <hi>Germany,</hi> and not from <hi>Rome.</hi> They made alſo thirteene <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> condemning thoſe for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, who doe not hold the Maſſe, for a true and proper <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or doe ſay it doth not helpe the Liuing and the dead, or doe not receiue the Canon of the Maſſe, or doe condemnd priuate <hi>Maſſes,</hi> or the ceremonies which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vſeth. And then foure Heads of doctrine were made. That in the Maſſe, is offered a true and proper Sacrifice, inſtituted by CHRIST; of the neceſſitie of the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, and how it agreeth with that of the Croſſe; of the fruits of that Sacrifice, and the application thereof; of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>While the Fathers doe entertaine themſelues in the buſineſſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, <note place="margin">The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> receiue letters from their Princes, with order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their negotiation.</note> the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> did receiue letters from their Princes, to proceed, and to preſent their doctrine, in the beſt maner they could. There, fore in the abſence of the Earle of <hi>Montfort,</hi> they entreated the Cardinall of <hi>Trent,</hi> to bee a meanes, that the Preſidents would receiue their letters, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Fathers, and giue them audience. The Cardinall promiſed all good office, but ſayd it was neceſſary to tell the Legate what they Would treat on; it being ſo conſtituted by the Fathers, mooued thereunto by the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by the Abbat of <hi>Belloſana.</hi> Therefore they imparted to him their inſtruction, ſaying, they were ſent to obtaine a ſafe Conduct for their Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, as it was giuen in <hi>Baſill</hi> to the <hi>Bohomians,</hi> and to propoſe their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; that, it being examined by the Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might be ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with their Diuines, when they came. The Legate, receiuing this rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Cardinall, imparted to him what the Pope had written, and <note place="margin">The anſwere of the Legate to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</note> told him, that it was not to be ſuffered, that either they or any other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, ſhould preſent their Doctrine, much leſſe be admitted to defend it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard there would bee no end of contentions that it was the office of the Fathers, which was obſerued vntill then, and ought to be continued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their doctrine, taken out of their Bookes, and condemne that which did deſerue it. If the Proteſtants had any difficultie, and did propoſe it hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and ſhew themſelues willing to receiue inſtruction, it ſhould bee giuen
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:17208:190"/>
by aduice of the Councel. Therefore hee denied abſolutely to aſſemble the Fathers, to receiue their doctrine, and ſaid, he could not change this opinion, though it ſhould coſt him his life. For altering the ſafe conduct, he ſaid it was an exorbitant indignity to the Councel, that they ſhould miſtruſt that which was granted, and that to treat thereof was an vnſupportable iniury, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued that all the faithfull ſhould ſpend their liues in oppoſing it.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Trent</hi> would not giue the anſwere ſo ſharpe to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſodors, but ſaid: That the Legate was angry, that they would begin with <note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore he adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to let that day paſſe, that the wrath of the Legat might be remitted, and then to beginne with ſome other point, that afterwards they might fall vpon thoſe two: that is, to preſent their doctrine, and deſire a ſafe conduct. They followed this counſell, and a few dayes after, the Cardinall being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Trent,</hi> they deſired the Emperours Ambaſſadour to perſwade the Legate to receiue their mandate, and heare their propoſition, that vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his minde they might reſolue, as they ſhould haue inſtruction from their Prince. The Ambaſſadour treated with the Legate, and had the ſame anſwere which was giuen to the Cardinal of <hi>Trent;</hi> which did not proceed from diſdaine, but from a reſolued will. The Ambaſſadour vnderſtanding the Legats mind, was of opinion that the buſineſſe could not then take place, and knowing that to relate the anſwere was diſhonourable for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who had ſo largely promiſed, that euery one ſhould be heard, propoſe freely, and conferre, in ſtead of giuing a direct anſwere to thoſe of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> he found diuers excuſes, to gain time, which he did not ſo artificially, though he were a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but that they were diſcouered to be pretences not to giue a plaine Negatiue.</p>
            <p>At this time Ambaſſadours went to <hi>Trent,</hi> from <hi>Argentina,</hi> and fiue Cities more, with inſtruction to preſent their doctrine.

To Cardinall <hi>Creſcentius</hi> hee gaue an account of the Cardinals made, promiſing to make them all vnderſtand his mind, how they ſhould demeane them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues towards his friend, vnto whom hee was ſo much obliged: And hee made the <hi>Nuncio</hi> of <hi>Siponto</hi> bee tolde that hee had diſpoſed of him as the friendſhip betweene them did require, and that hee ſhould not care to know wherein, but ſhould continue to performe his dutie, as formerly hee had done.</p>
            <p>Chriſtmas being ended, a generall Congregation was made, to giue forme <note place="margin">A generall congregation is held to ſet downe a rule for the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Sacrament of Order.</note> to the handling of the Sacrament of Order. They diſcourſed of the abuſes which, in this, were entred into the Church, and the <hi>Nuncio</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erona</hi> ſaid, that there was in all ſome abuſe, worthy of amendment, but in this an ocean of them. And, after many tragicall exclamations were made, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, accordingly to their cuſtome, firſt to propoſe the Articles drawne out of the Lutheran doctrine, and then diſcuſſe which ſhould bee condemned for hereticall, and frame the <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> and Heads of doctrine and in the end, ſpeake of the abuſes. Twelue Articles were giuen to the Diuines, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they diſcourſed, morning and euening. Out of the opinions of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, the Deputie Fathers framed firſt eight <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> condemning for
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:17208:191"/>
hereticall to ſay, that Order is not a true and proper Sacrament; or that it is <note place="margin">1552 IVLIVS 3. CHARLES 5. EDWARD 6. HENRY 2.</note> one onely, which tendeth to Prieſthood, by many meanes; to denie the <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> to ſay that the conſent of the people is neceſſary; to ſay that there is not one viſible Prieſthood; that Vnction is not neceſſary; that the holy Ghoſt is not giuen in it; that Biſhops are not <hi>De iure Diuino,</hi> and ſuperiour to Prieſts. Vpon theſe, foure points of Doctrine were made; of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and inſtitution of the Sacrament of Order; of the viſible and external Prieſthood of the Church; of the Eccleſiaſticall <hi>Hierarchie;</hi> of the difference of a Prieſt from a Biſhop. This doctrine and Canons, beeing approoued by the general Congregation, were all put into one Decree, vnder the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text: with that of the Sacrifice, to be publiſhed in a Seſſion. Yet it was not <note place="margin">Why no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of what was handled in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember and Ianuary.</note> done for the reaſons which ſhall be declared. Therefore there is no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mention made of what did paſſe in the Congregations of December and Ianuary, becauſe the ſame things were diſcuſſed againe vnder <hi>Pius</hi> 4: in the third reduction of the Councell: vnto which when we ſhall come, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ſhall bee ſhewed betweene the Decrees framed now, and thoſe which were after eſtabliſhed vnder <hi>Pius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But newes comming to <hi>Trent</hi> that there were leuies made of Souldiers, <note place="margin">The Electors craue leaue to depart.</note> throughout all <hi>Germany,</hi> and that there was feare of warre, the three E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors ſeeing their States were in danger, craued leaue of the Emperour, by Letters and Meſſengers, to returne, that they might preſerue them. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the Councell ſhould continue, anſwered them, in the beginning of the yeere 1552. that the troubles were not ſo great as the fame; that he had ſent <note place="margin">1552.</note> to know the trueth, and that a few men onely were in Armes; but that the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties continued in their obedience, and <hi>Maurice,</hi> of whom the report was, that he had raiſed ſome ſtirres, would ſhortly come vnto him, and had ſent Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, who were already in <hi>Iſpruc,</hi> and would ſhortly be in <hi>Trent;</hi> that thoſe few Souldiers, lodged in <hi>Thuringia,</hi> who made ſome excurſions vpon the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorie of the Biſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> did mutin for want of pay onely; that he had ſent one exppreſly to pay them, and giue them their paſport; that hee knew whatſoeuer was ſpoken and feared, and did not neglect any thing; that he had ſome in euery place to aduertiſe him, and did ſpare no coſt; therefore hee exhorted them not to abandon the Councell, which would bee in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to bee diſſolued with their departure, which would giue a great blowe to Religion: and if their States want any prouiſion, let them commaund their Miniſters, and giue him notice, and hee will giue them all aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wolfius Colerus,</hi> and <hi>Leonardus Badebornus,</hi> Ambaſſadors for <hi>Maurice,</hi> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <note place="margin">The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> come to <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> arriued in <hi>Trent</hi> the 7 of Ianuary; which gaue great ioy to the Electors and German Prelates, being aſſured hereby, that <hi>Maurice</hi> did not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing. They firſt treated with the Emperors Ambaſſadors, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that their Prince, deſirous of concord, determined to ſend to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ſome godly Diuines, men louing peace, which the other Proteſtant Princes would doe alſo; but that a ſafe Conduct was firſt neceſſary, in the <note place="margin">Their nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</note> forme of that of <hi>Baſill,</hi> and that, in the meane while, all treatie in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ſhould ceaſe, and that, after their arriuall, the things already handled ſhould bee reexamined, it not beeing a generall Councell without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:17208:191"/>
of all Nations; that the Pope ſhould haue no power to preſide, but ſhould ſubmit himſelfe to the Councell, and releaſe the oath to the Biſhops, that their voyces may be free. They added, that, in the Congregation, they would expound all more at large, which they deſired ſhould bee aſſembled quickly, becauſe their Diuines were within the diſtance of fourty miles, and did expect onely to bee called. The Emperours Ambaſſadours gaue good wordes, becauſe the Emperour to entertaine <hi>Maurice,</hi> commaunded they ſhould bee well vſed. Theſe Ambaſſadours treated in the ſame manner with the Prince Electors, and Cardinall of <hi>Trent,</hi> but refuſed to treate with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Creſcentius,</hi> and his Colleagues, that they might not ſeeme to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them for Preſidents. They deſired to bee admitted in publique, to preſent their <hi>Mandate,</hi> and to bee receiued as thoſe of the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburg</hi> had been; whereof the Emperours Ambaſſadours gaue them hope, and promiſe, that they might entertaine them. But, on the other ſide, the Legate and <hi>Nuncij</hi> did plainely refuſe to alter the forme of the Safe Conduct, <note place="margin">The anſwere of the Legate and <hi>Nuncij.</hi>
               </note> ſaying, it was too much diſhonourable for the Synode, which repreſenteth the Catholike Church, that foure Sectaries ſhould make difficulty to beleeue it; neither would they ſtoppe the courſe of the Decrees, already put in order with maturitie. And what hope can there bee of the conuerſion of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> when they come with theſe demaunds. And, for hearing them in publike, it was iuſt, becauſe it was promiſed; but beeing ſent to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, of which they ſee and know that the Legate and <hi>Nuncij</hi> are Preſidents, they muſt acknowledge them for ſuch, or elſe they cannot bee admitted; for ſo they had ſpeciall Commiſſion from the Pope, when thoſe of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> came; that to releaſe oathes, and ſuch like impieties, they would rather die, then cauſe to be done: and that they would ſooner depart, diſſolue the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and command the Prelates not to aſſiſt at any acte. The Emperour, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <note place="margin">Offendeth the Emperour.</note> hereof, who tooke the buſineſſe to the heart, was offended with the obſtinacie of the Papalins, who, vpon a nice point of honour, would diſturbe a buſineſſe of that conſequence, and raiſe a warre, which, in the end, might be their owne ruine. And he ſent backe order to his Ambaſſadours, and the Cardinall <hi>Madruccio,</hi> to vſe all meanes, and his owne authoritie alſo, to pacific the Legate, firſt with intreaties, then with high words, if they could not find a temper, which might ſatisfie both parties, and to force the Preſidents, in a ciuill manner, to yeeld to that which was iuſt.</p>
            <p>The Emperours Ambaſſadours, and <hi>Madruccio,</hi> aduiſing together, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not to demand of the Preſidents all at once, but firſt, onely to receiue the Ambaſſadours; wherein they vſed long perſwaſions, which did all tend to ſhew, that when they were brought into the aſſembly, where themſelues are Preſidents, it might be ſaid, that their Preſidencie was acknowledged though before no particular complement had beene vſed with them. To the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, they added intreaties in the Emperours name; mixed with ſome words, ſignifying that it was not fit to abuſe his clemencie, nor to force him to vſe other remedies; that neceſſity was a potent incitation, to him that had power in his hand. In the end <hi>Creſcentius</hi> ſuffered himſelfe to be perſwaded to receiue them, not in Seſſion, but in a publique generall Congregation in his houſe, thinking that thereby he ſhould be acknowledged as Head. His edge
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:17208:192"/>
beeing thus abated, they came to ſpeake of ceaſing to treate of the points of doctrine. <hi>Toledo</hi> ſaid, that he had heard it often preached, that the ſauing of one ſoule was ſo deare to CHRIST, that hee would deſcend againe, and ſuffer on the Croſſe to gaine it; and now that they refuſed to ſaue all <hi>Germany,</hi> where was the imitation of CHRIST? The Legate excuſed himſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the abſolute commands of the Pope, which hee muſt needes obey. But the Ambaſſadour replying, that, to a Miniſter inſtruction is giuen, in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <note place="margin">At y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſtance of whoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters they change their opinion.</note> and matters of diſcretion are referred to iudgement, the Legate ſaid, that hee ſaw well, that this was a degree to demand a retractation of the things already decided. The Ambaſſadour gaue his word that hee would neuer ſpeake of that, yea, would deale effectually with the Saxons, to make them deſiſt from that requeſt. In the end, the Legate, perſwaded by the <hi>Nuncio</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erona,</hi> who ſuffered himſelfe to bee ouercome firſt, not to lay (hee ſayd) on the Popes backe, and the Councels, ſo great a burthen, that ſo important a buſineſſe ſhould bee precipitated, and ſo ſmall a delay denied, condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſay, that hee was content, ſo that the Prelates, in the generall Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, did approoue it; to whom alſo he referred himſelfe for the Safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which they required.</p>
            <p>The Congregation was called, to conſult vpon theſe particulars; and the delay was eaſily granted, vpon the perſwaſions of the Imperialiſts. For the Safe conduct, the conſultation was more hard, not onely for the reaſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by the Legate, but becauſe the name of the Councell of <hi>Baſill,</hi> and the referring themſelues to it, was abhorred; and, which did more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, they thought that ſome things might fit thoſe times, and not theſe, becauſe the doctrine of the Bohemians was not ſo contrary to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Notwithſtanding all theſe oppoſitions, the authoritie of the three Electors, and of the Cardinall <hi>Madruccio,</hi> and the negotiation of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Ambaſſadours preuailed.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Petrus Tagliauia,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Palermo,</hi> ſayd, that one very princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall point was omitted, whether it ſhould bee allowed, that they ſhould ſit <note place="margin">A conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about the maner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceruing the Proteſtants in Councell.</note> in the Councell or not, and what termes of honour ſhould bee giuen them, and their Prince. For, to vſe them meanly would breake off the buſineſſe, and to honour manifeſt heretiques, would bee a great preiudice. The ſame, and greater conſideration muſt bee had, how to behaue themſelues towards the Diuines which are to come, who pretend to haue a voyce, and will bee a partie in diſputations and Conſultations, nor will be eſteemed, as the Church muſt eſteeme them, that is, as heretiques, excommunicated, and condemned, with whom it is not lawfull to treat, but onely to inſtruct them, if they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly craue it, and pardon them by fauour. Concerning this propoſition, much was ſaid of the varietie of times, vnto which all lawes muſt be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated; that the ſame Popes which did conſtitute thoſe Decretals, would not obſerue them in theſe occaſions; that nothing is more eaſily broken, then that which is moſt hard. Which reaſons, though they perſwaded the maior part, yet they knew not what to reſolue. It ſeemed, that to determine what rigor of the law was to bee retained, and what to bee mitigated, was a matter of much and long conſultation, not to bee reſolued on without the Pope and Colledge of Cardinals, which the ſtraitneſſe of time could not
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:17208:192"/>
ſuffer. When all were doubtfull, the Biſhop of <hi>Namberg</hi> opportunely ſayd, that neceſſity did excuſe euery tranſgreſſion, and that in the <hi>Colloquies</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> theſe things were naturely conſidered on, and ſo decided. But, for more aſſurance, it was good to make a Proteſtation before, that all was done for charitie, and piety, which are aboue all law, and to reduce thoſe that wander, and that it is vnderſtood to bee done without preiudice; with thoſe clauſes which the Lawyers know how to find. This opinion was readily embraced, firſt by the Dutch, then by the Spaniſh Prelates, and at laſt, ſomewhat coldly by the Italians, the Legate remaining immooueable, and ſhewing plainely that hee ſtood quiet, being forced by neceſſitie. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions beeing ſetled; it was reſolued, that, the 24. of the moneth, there ſhould bee a generall Congregation, to receiue and heare the Saxon Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, that the 25. day the Seſſion ſhould bee held, wherein the dilation, made vntill the comming of the Proteſtant Diuines, ſhould be publiſhed, and Fathers elected, who, together with the <hi>Nuncio</hi> of <hi>Sponto,</hi> ſhould make the Decree, the Proteſtation, and Safe Conduct. The Emperours Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours deſired to haue the draught of the Safe Conduct, before it was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, to ſhew it the Proteſtants, that if it did not giue them ſatisfaction, it might be ſo amended, that they might not haue occaſion to refuſe it as they did the other.</p>
            <p>The dayes following were ſpent in the things aforeſaid; which beeing <note place="margin">An exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Emperours Ambaſſadour <hi>Pictauius</hi> to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> finiſhed, the Emperours Ambaſſadours called the Proteſtants to them; and the Ambaſſadour <hi>Pictauius,</hi> hauing made an eloquent encomiaſtique orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the goodneſſe and charitie of the Fathers, and exhorted them to giue ſome little part of ſatisfaction to the Councell, as they receiued much from it, told them that it was concluded to receiue their <hi>Mandats</hi> and perſons and to heare their propoſitions, and to deferre the concluſion of the points of doctrine, though already diſcuſſed and digeſted, to expect the Diuines, and heare them firſt. That they ſhould haue a very ample Safe Conduct, as they deſired, whereof the draught was made. And hee was copious in ſhewing that theſe were memorable fauours and graces, ſaying, it was neceſſary to yeeld ſomething to the time, and not to deſire all at once; that when they ſhall bee entred into the buſineſſe, occaſion will make them obtaine many things, which before ſeemed hard; that the Fathers doe deſire the comming of the Diuines; that themſelues, the Emperours Ambaſſadours, haue mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to propoſe of great moment, and doe ſtand onely expecting that the Proteſtants ſhould beginne, that afterwards they may come foorth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo. For this cauſe he prayed them to proceed ſlowly, in their demand, that the Pope ſhould ſubmit himſelfe to the Councell. For the Fathers doe know, that there is ſome thing to bee amended in the Papall greatneſſe, but withall, that they muſt goe on cunningly; that themſelues haue dayly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, what dexterity and Art muſt bee vſed, in treating with the Popes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Likewiſe the reexamination of the things already concluded, was not to be propoſed in the very beginning, becauſe it would bee too great an infamy and diſhonour to the Councell. Therefore let their Diuine come, who ſhould haue a conuenient audience in all things, and when they ſhall ſee themſelues wronged, it ſhall euer be free for them to depart. The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:17208:193"/>
retyring themſelues, and conſidering, the draught of the ſafe Conduct, were not content, becauſe it was not like to that of <hi>Baſill,</hi> in which foure things more were granted to the Bohemians. 1. That they ſhould haue a deciſiue voyce. 2. That the holy Scripture, the practiſe of ancient Church the Councels, and Interpreters conformable to the Scripture, ſhould bee Iudges. 3. That they might exerciſe their religion in their houſes. 4. That nothing ſhould be done in contempt and diſdaine of their doctrine. Of <note place="margin">Who are not content with the forme of the Safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</note> theſe foure, the ſecond was different from that which was graunted in this draught, and the three others were totally left out. They ſuſpected alſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Councell did not promiſe them ſecurity in the name of the Pope and Colledge of Cardinals as did that of <hi>Baſil.</hi> Yet they reſolued not to make mention of this but to demand the inſerting of the other 4. clauſes: and told the Emperours Ambaſſadours plainly, that they could not receiue it in this forme becauſe they had this expreſſe commiſſion in their inſtructions. <hi>Toledo</hi> ſhewed ſome diſdaine, that they ſhould not content themſelues, with that which he, and his Colleagues, had obtained, with ſo much paines; that the chiefe importance was in the ſecurity of comming and departing, and that the reſidue appertained to the maner of their negotiation, which might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be concluded by the preſence of the Diuines; that it was too much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie to yeeld in nothing, and to deſire to giue lawes alone to the whole <note place="margin">For which cauſe <hi>Toledo</hi> the Emperors Ambaſſadour is offended.</note> Church. But it not being impoſſible to remoue them with theſe reaſons, from their reſolution, they ſaid, in the end, that they would referre it to the Fathers, to whom they reſtored the draught of the ſafe Conduct, with the additions which were required.</p>
            <p>The Legate and preſidents, vnderſtanding the requeſt and reſolution of the Proteſtants, ſhewed the Emperours Ambaſſadours how vniuſt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet their demands were. For in the forme or that of <hi>Baſil</hi> they neuer found that it was granted to haue a deciſiue voyce in the Councell; but, that the Scripture, practiſe of the Church, Councels, and Doctours, who ground themſelues on it, ſhould bee Iudges, is ſayd, becauſe the practiſe of the Church is called by the name of Apoſtolicall Tradition: and when it is ſaid, the holy Fathers, it is vnderſtood that they ground themſelues on the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe they haue no other gounds. The third, to exerciſe their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in their owne houſes, is vnderſtood, with condition that it bee not knowen, and done without ſcandall. The prohibition, that nothing ſhall bee done in contempt of them, is expreſſe when it is promiſed, that, by no meanes, they ſhall bee offended. Therefore that it did appeare that they complayned without cauſe, onely to cauill, and in regard there is no hope to content them, there doeth remaine nothing but to giue them the Safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, as it is made, and to leaue them to their liberty, to make vſe of it or not, The Earle of <hi>Mountfort</hi> replied, that nothing could bee more ſeruiceable to the publique cauſe, then to take from them all pretences and cauils, and to make them vnexcuſable to the world: therefore, in regard there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all difference betweene the Safe Conduct of <hi>Baſil</hi> and this, to ſtoppe their mouthes, that might bee copied out <hi>Verbatim,</hi> changing onely the names of the perſons, places, and times. The Preſidents mooued with that ſubtile and ſtrict anſwere, looked one vpon another, and the Legat, taking the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:17208:193"/>
vpon him, anſwered, that it ſhould be referred to the Fathers, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and reſolued according to their determination. The Preſidents did recommend the cauſe of GOD and the Church, euery one to his famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar friends. To the Italians and Spaniards they ſaid, that it was great iniury to bee compelled to follow a company of Schiſmatiques, who haue ſpoken vnaduiſedly, and contrary to Chriſtian doctrine, and bound themſelues to follow the Scripture onely. But vnto all in generall, they ſayd, it would be a great indignitie, if the Councell ſhould ſo ſpeake, as that an inextricable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſhould preſently ariſe. For in ſetting downe what Doctors doe ground themſelues vpon the Scripture, they ſhould neuer agree: that it was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for the Councell to ſpeake plainely, and that the expreſſion made was iuſt the declaration of the Councel of <hi>Baſil.</hi> And ſuch perſwaſions they vſed, as that almoſt all were reſolued not to change the draught, hoping that though the Proteſtants deſired it ſhould bee better, yet they would bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent when they ſaw all was done.</p>
            <p>All being in order, the foure and twentieth day the generall Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the Councel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the admiſſion of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> was made; in which the Electors and all the Fathers met in the Legates houſe, as alſo the Ambaſſadours of the Emperour, and of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who were not wont to be preſent in ſuch kinds of Congregation. The Legat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan breifly, and ſaid, they were aſſembled to beginne an action, the moſt doubtfull that euer happened to the holy Church: therefore they were to pray GOD for good ſucceſſe, with more then vſuall deuotion; and, hauing, inuocated the name of the holy Ghoſt, as the cuſtome is in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the <hi>Protestation</hi> was read by the Secretary; whereunto all the Fathers hauing giuen conſent, the Speaker deſired it ſhould bee regiſtred in the actes, and a publique inſtrument made of it. The tenour whereof was thus in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. That the holy Synode, not to hinder the progreſſe of the Councell, by the diſputes which would ariſe, when it ſhould be duely examined, what ſort of perſons ſhould appeare in the Synode, and what ſort of <hi>Mandats</hi> and Writings bee preſented, and in what places men ſhould ſit, doth declare, that, if any be admitted for himſelfe, or as a deputie, which ought not to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the diſpoſition of the law, or vſe of the Councels, or ſet not in his right place, or if <hi>Mandats,</hi> Inſtruments, Proteſtations, or other writings, which doe, or may, offend the honour, authority, or power of the Councell bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, it ſhall bee vnderſtood, that the preſent or future generall Councels ſhall not bee preiudiced, it being the Synods meaning to reſtore peace and concord vnto the Church, by any meanes, ſo that it bee lawfull and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the Saxon Ambaſſadours were brought in; where beeing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Badehornus</hi> one of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours maketh an oration in the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</note> and hauing made their obeiſance to the aſſembly, <hi>Badehornus</hi> ſpake, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing theſe titles, Moſt reuerend, and moſt worthy Fathers and Lords. The ſubſtance of his ſpeach was this. That <hi>Maurice,</hi> Electour of <hi>Saxony</hi> wiſhing them the aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit, and a happy iſſue of the action, did let them know, that hee had long ſince reſolued, that if euer a generall, free, and Chriſtian Councel were celebrated, where the controuerſies of Religion might be decided according to the holy Scripture, and all might ſpeake ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, and a Reformation bee made in the Head and the members, to ſend

his Diuines thither. That now thinking they are aſſembled to this end, hee hath called his Theologues together, commanding them to chooſe ſome, to carry their <hi>Confeſsion</hi> to that Synod; which was not yet done, in regard of a certaine conſtitution of the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> that faith or ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, giuen by the Emperour, Kings, or others, to heretiques, or perſons ſuſpected, ought not to bee obſerued; and of the example of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> who would not goe to <hi>Baſill,</hi> without ſecuritie from the Councell. Therefore that the <hi>Elector</hi> deſired that ſuch a ſafe Conduct ſhould bee giuen to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, Counſellors, and their families; that not long ſince a certaine forme of ſafe Conduct was preſented to him, much different from that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> ſo that the Diuines thought it dangerous to come hither with it, becauſe, by ſome Decrees made in <hi>Trent,</hi> and already printed, it did appeare, that they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted heretiques and ſchiſmatiques, though they neuer haue beene either called or heard. Therefore the Prince demaundeth, (he ſayd) that his men may be excuſed and a ſafe Conduct granted, in the forme of that of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and that, vnderſtanding that they would proceede to the concluſion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſed Articles, it ſeemed vnto him a thing preiudiciall, and contrary to all law of GOD and Man, in regard his men were lawfully hindered, for want of a ſafe Conduct. Who therefore prayeth them that all may be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vntill his Diuines be heard, who be but ſixty Dutch miles diſtant. That afterwards it being related to him, that the Proteſtants may not be heard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the controuerſed Articles, defined the yeeres paſt, the greater part of which containe grieuous errours, the Prince deſireth that they may be reex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and his Diuines ſuffered to ſpeake, and that determined which ſhall bee conformable to the word of GOD, and beleeued by all Nations of the Chriſtian world. For the things determined haue beene handled by very few of thoſe who ought to aſſiſt in the generall Councell, as doeth appeare by the printed Catalogue; it beeing eſſentiall to a generall Councel, that all Nations ſhould bee admitted, and freely heard. That the Prince alſo doeth remember, that many controuerſed Articles doe concerne the Pope; and the Councels of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> hauing determined, that the Pope, in points of faith, and which concerne himſelfe, is ſubiect to the Councell, it is fit the ſame ſhould be done in this place, as alſo, which was conſtituted in the third Seſſion of the Councell of <hi>Baſil,</hi> that all perſons of the Councell ſhould bee abſolued from the oathes of Obligation to the Pope, as farre as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the cauſes of the Councell. Yea, that the Prince is of opinion, that, without any further declaration, by vertue of the conſtitutions of thoſe Councels, all are free from thoſe bonds. Therefore prayeth the aſſembly, that they would firſt repeate, approoue, and ratifie the Article of the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of the Councell aboue the Pope, eſpecially in regard the Cleargie hath need of reformation, which hath beene hindered by the Popes. For the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes cannot bee amended, if the perſons of the Councell depend on the Popes nod, and bee bound, by vertue of oath, to preſerue his honour, ſtate, and power: and if it might bee obtained of the Pope to remit the oath wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, it would be praiſe-worthy, and gaine great fauour, credit, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Councell, becauſe the Decrees would bee made by free men, who might lawfully treat, and iudge according to the word of CHRIST. That
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:17208:194"/>
in concluſion the Prince deſireth that his propoſitions may be taken in good part, being moued to tender them, for the zeale of his owne ſaluation, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie towards his Countrey, and peace of all Chriſtendome. Hauing this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in writing, he preſented it, and it was receiued by the Secretary, and the Speaker ſaid in the common name, that the Synod would conſider of it, and make anſwere in due time.</p>
            <p>After theſe, thoſe of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> were heard, who preſented the <hi>Mandate</hi> of <note place="margin">And ſo do the Ambaſſadors of the Duke of <hi>Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg.</hi>
               </note> their Ambaſſage. Which being read, they briefly ſaid; that they were to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Confeſſion of their doctrine, and that Diuines would come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, and handle the ſame things more at large, ſo that iudges might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently choſen by both ſides, to take knowledge of the controuerſies. For their doctrine being repugnant to that of the Pope and the Biſhops his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, it was vniuſt that either the Plaintife, or the defendant ſhould be iudge: deſiring therefore, that what was done in the Councel the yeeres paſt, might not haue the ſtrength of a law, but that the diſcuſſion of euery thing already handled ſhould begin again, it being not iuſt, that when two contend in law, what is done by one, the other beeing lawfully abſent, ſhould bee of forces and the rather, becauſe it may be cleerely demonſtrated, that aſwell in the laſt actions, as in thoſe of the yeeres before, Decrees haue been publiſhed contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the word of GOD. And they preſented their doctrine, and diſcourſe in writing: all which was receiued by the Secretary, but the doctrine was not read. The Speaker anſwered in the name of the Fathers, that anſwere ſhould be giuen in time conuenient.</p>
            <p>When this was done, the Electours and Ambaſſadours departed, the <note place="margin">The Fathers reſolue not to alter the Safe Conduct.</note> Prelates remaining with the Preſidents, to giue order for the Seſsion. Firſt, the Decree was eſtabliſhed, and then the Safe Conduct propoſed, adding the cauſes why the Proteſtants were not content. And conſulting, whether that which they deſired ſhould bee added to the forme, they did eaſily agree all in one opinion, that nothing ſhould be added, to auoide inextricable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and ineuitable preiudices.</p>
            <p>The next day, the 25. of Ianuary, deputed for the Seſſion, they went to the <note place="margin">The Seſſion.</note> Church with the vſuall Ceremonies, but with more Souldiers, called by the Preſidents, to make oſtentation of the greatnes of the Councel, and with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrangers, who came thither, thinking the Proteſtants ſhould be receiued publikely, and with ſingular ceremonies. The B. of <hi>Catanea</hi> ſang Maſſe, and <hi>Iohn Baptiſta Campeggio,</hi> B. of <hi>Maiorica,</hi> preached, and, the vſuall Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, the Decree was read by the Maſſe Biſhop; the ſubſtance whereof was: That the Synod, to performe the things already decreed hauing exactly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled <note place="margin">The Decree.</note> whatſoeuer belongeth to the Sacrifice of the Maſſe, &amp; Sacrament of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to publiſh in the Seſſion the Decrees concerning them, and the 4.

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:17208:195"/>
with the Decrees of the holy mother the Church, hath put off the next Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vntill the nineteenth of March, to giue light to, and publiſh the things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, granting them (to remoue all cauſe of greater delay) a ſafe Conduct, of the tenour as ſhall be recited, determining to handle, in the meane while, the Sacrament of Matrimony, and to proſecute the reformation, that they may publiſh the definitions of this, together with the definitions of the things aforeſayd. The ſubſtance of the ſafe Conduct was; That the Synod, adhering <note place="margin">The Safe Conduct.</note> to the ſafe Conduct already giuen, and amplifying it, doeth make faith to all Prieſts, Princes, Nobles, and perſons, of what condition ſoeuer, of the German nation, which ſhall, or are already come to the Councell, Safe Conduct to come, remaine, propoſe, and ſpeake in the Synode, to handle and examine what they thinke fit, giue articles, and confirme them, anſwere the obiections of the Councell, and diſpute with thoſe whom it doth elect, declaring that the controuerſies in this Councell ſhall bee handled according to the holy Scripture, Traditions of the Apoſtles, approoued Councels, conſent of the Catholike Church, and authoritie of the holy Fathers, adding, that they ſhall not be puniſhed vpon pretence of Religion, or offences committed, or which will bee committed, ſo that there neede not bee any ceſſation from Diuine Seruice, by reaſon of their preſence, either in the iourney, or in the Citie of <hi>Trent,</hi> or in any place elſe, and ſhall returne when it ſhall ſeeme good vnto them, without let, with ſafety of their robe, honour, and perſons, but with the knowledge of the deputies of the Synode, that prouiſion may bee made for their ſecurity: granting that, in this ſafe Conduct, all thoſe clauſes bee held to bee included, which are neceſſary for reall and full aſſurance: adding, that if any of them, either in comming, or in <hi>Trent,</hi> or in returning, ſhall commit any enormity, which ſhall nullifie the benefit of this publike faith, hee ſhall be puniſhed by their own Iudges, ſo that the Synod may be ſatisfied: and, on the other ſide, if any other in comming hither, remaining here, or returning ſhall commit any thing which may violate this Safe Conduct, hee ſhall bee puniſhed by the Synode, with the approbation of the Germans themſelues, who ſhall be preſent in <hi>Trent,</hi> the forme of the aſſicuration remaining ſtill in force, giuing leaue to their Ambaſſadours to goe out of <hi>Trent,</hi> to take the ayre, and returne, to ſend and receiue aduiſes, and meſſengers, as often as they ſhall thinke fit, yet accompanied with the Deputies, for their ſcecurity: which Safe Conduct ſhall remaine in force, ſo long as they be vnder the care of the Synode, in comming to <hi>Trent,</hi> in their abiding there, and twenty dayes after they ſhall aske leaue to depart, or after it ſhall bee granted to them, that they may bee rendred in a ſecure place, at their election: which things it promiſeth faithfully, in the name of all faithfull Chriſtians, of all the Princes, Eccleſiaſticall and Secular, and likewiſe of all other perſons Eccleſiaſticall and Secular, of all conditions: faithfully promiſing withall, that the Synod ſhall not ſeeke occaſion, publikely or ſecretly, that any thing bee attempted in preiudice of this Safe Conduct, nor to violate the ſame, will vſe, or ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to vſe any authority, power, right, ſtatute, or priuiledge of Lawes, Canons, or Councels, eſpecially that of <hi>Constance,</hi> and of <hi>Siena:</hi> which things in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, and for this time, it doth diſallow. And if the Synod, or any perſon in it, or any that belong to them ſhall violate the forme of this Safe Conduct in
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:17208:195"/>
any point or clauſe whatſoeuer, and puniſhment bee not inflicted to their approbation, let them thinke that the Synode hath incurred all the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the violaters of ſuch Safe Conducts may incurre by the law of GOD, or man, or cuſtome, without admitting excuſe, or contradiction. Theſe things being read, the Seſſion was ended. It is certaine that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, doubtfull what might enſue, were willing to bee prepared, if the winde were proſperous, to decide the matter of the Sacraments, all in one Seſſion: and therefore hauing in a readineſſe all that belonged to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, the Maſſe, and Sacrament of Order, they were deſirous to digeſt alſo and put in order all that concerned Matrimonie, that they might put all into one bundle, and to handle ſuccinctly, in another Seſſion, Purgatorie, Indulgences, Images, Reliques, and ſuch ſmall matters, (for ſo they called them) and then to end the Councell. And if any thing were oppoſed to this deſeigne, they might ſhew that the fault was not in them.</p>
            <p>Many, who read theſe occurrences, will maruell that the Pope, from whom all conſultations of farre leſſe moment were wont to proceed, is not named. Which they will ceaſe to doe, when they ſhall know, that hee was aduiſed from point to point, of all the accidents and deſeignes, and that, when thoſe of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> were arriued, and newes came that more were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, hee anſwered his Legate, and <hi>Nuncij,</hi> that the Proteſtants ſhould bee entertained with as much courteſie as was poſſible, knowing it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in ſuch caſes, to ſuffer ſome indignity; willing them to vſe diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe patience winneth honour in the end. That they ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from all publique Colloquie in matter of religion, either by writing, or by word of mouth. That they ſhould endeauour, by perſwaſions and hopes, to gaine ſome of the Proteſtant Doctours, and ſhould ſpare no coſt. The Pope was aduiſed of euery thing that was done, yet nothing hapned that might make him alter his purpoſe. But when hee vnderſtood that the Emperours Ambaſſadours had giuen the Proteſtants hope to moderate the Papall authoritie and ſaid that they expected to ſee a gate laide open by their negotiation, that afterwards they might ſecond it, and bring in thoſe things which they had deſeigned, and that the Fathers did hold it neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine it, <note place="margin">Why the Pope is aliened from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> hauing other intelligence that all the Spaniards were of that minde, and that the Emperour did deſeigne to aduance himſelfe by debaſing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie, and did cheriſh the Proteſtants, to ſhew that it did not proceed from him, his mind was aliened from him, and turned to the French King. Hee therefore hearkened to the treaty of the Cardinall <hi>Tornon,</hi> in the Kings name, which being executed, the diſſolution of the Councell would follow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his paines, or without ſhewing that he did deſire it.</p>
            <p>The Seſſion beeing made, the Proteſtants, though they perceiued that the Safe Conduct was not enlarged, as they deſired, diſſembling the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, did demand it, and an authenticall copie was conſigned by the Emperours Ambaſſadours, to the Ambaſſadours of each Prince. Who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing read it, did complaine that promiſes were not kept, and required the Synods anſwere to their expoſitions, and to their requeſts, made concerning the manner of proceeding in the Councell. The Imperialiſts perſwaded them to goe on with dexterity, ſaying, as before, that with time they ſhould
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:17208:196"/>
obtaine all, but ſeeking things diſtaſtfull, and before there was opportunity, euery thing would be more hard. That it was not neceſſary to expreſſe in the Safe Conduct, that they might exerciſe their religion in their houſes, in regard it was vnderſtood to be granted, becauſe it was not forbid. That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould bee done to their diſgrace was plainely expreſſed, in that good and reall vſage was promiſed, and, beſides that, publique prohibitions will be made to all, which will be of greater force. For the reaſons to be alleadged in Councell, the ſame was ſaid in ſubſtance, that the Scripture ſhall bee the ground, but when there is controuerſie of the meaning of it, it will bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that the Councell ſhould be iudge. For it is dumbe of it ſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſoule, and, as ciuill Lawes, hath neede of a Iudge to giue it life; which, in matter of religion is the Councell, as hath been obſerued euer ſince the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time. The Proteſtants receiued the Safe Conduct, but with <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> that they did it onely to ſend it to their Princes. <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants receiue the ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct with proteſtation. 33.

            </p>
            <p>The Preſidents, to examine the Sacrament of Matrimony, as was decreed, making a generall Congregation, and chooſing Deputies, gaue foorth 33. Articles, in that matter, to be diſcuſſed by the Diuines. They ordained alſo, that the Deputies ſhould make the Canons, as the particulars were exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Some Congregations were held, and ſixe Canons framed. Whereupon the Proteſtants complained to the Emperours Ambaſſadours, that the hope that with time they ſhould obtaine a reuiew of the things decided, was quite taken away, becauſe they proceeded to new deciſions, while their Diuines were expected. The Emperours Ambaſſadours could not obtaine of the <note place="margin">Whereof the Proteſtant Ambaſſadors do complaine</note> Preſidents to ſtop their proceeding, which they haſtened with all diligence, that either the Proteſtants might not come to <hi>Trent,</hi> or, if they came, might finde all decided. For the reexamination, the Pope, the Court, and all the <note place="margin">The <hi>Papaline</hi> doe deſire to proceed the faſter.</note> Prelates, were reſolued to denie it conſtantly. And they thought that they might with better ground denie the reuiſion of many things, then of a few. But the Emperour, whom it did much concerne, to bring the Proteſtants to <hi>Trent,</hi> but nothing at all to haue the matters reexamined, aduiſed by his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, of what the Proteſtants complained, and how they were hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">But are ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by the Emperour.</note> to goe to the Councell, ſent a man to <hi>Trent,</hi> with commiſſion to goe to <hi>Rome</hi> alſo to negotiate, that all action might be deferred for ſome few dayes, ſhewing that that haſte did precipitate the buſineſſe, gaue ſuſpicion to the Proteſtants, and made them more vnwilling to goe to the Councell. He gaue order alſo, that his men ſhould bee commanded not to proceede, and ſhould Proteſt againſt the <hi>Papalins,</hi> if perſwaſions would not ſerue. This reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Emperour, ſignified in <hi>Trent,</hi> cauſed a generall Congregation to be called, where it was reſolued, to deſiſt from all Conciliary act, during plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Synode.</p>
            <p>But the Pope was diſpleaſed with that which was done, and diſdaining <note place="margin">Wherewith the Pope is diſpleaſed.</note> at the Emperour for other cauſes alſo, wrote to <hi>Trent,</hi> that ſuſpending the actions as few dayes as was poſſible, they ſhould, for reputation of the <note place="margin">As alſo with the attempt of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine.</hi>
               </note> Councell, reſume them without reſpect. Another cauſe, which, beſides this, had prouoked the Pope and Cardinals, was, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> deſiring to poſſeſſe <hi>Tranſiluania,</hi> which was aſſaulted by the Turkes on the other ſide; vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to keepe it for the young ſonne of <hi>Iohn <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aiuode, George Martinaccio,</hi>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:17208:196"/>
Biſhop of <hi>Veradino,</hi> a man of excellent wiſedome, and great reputation in that Countrey, was willing to keepe it in liberty, and, to auoyd greater danger, not being able to conteſt with the Turkes and the houſe of <hi>Austria</hi> at once, made choyce to ioyne himſelfe with theſe, by whom counterpoyſing the Turkes, he held all in an euen balance. Thoſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> knowing that by gaining of this Prelat, they ſhould wholly obtaine their purpoſe, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> beſides other things which hee did to oblige him more vnto them, promiſed him a penſion of eighty thouſand Crownes, and the Emperour obtayned of the Pope with great inſtance, to create him Cardinall, and (which was ſeldome vſed) to ſend the Cap, and to giue him leaue to weare the ſcarlet habit, which was not lawfull, becauſe hee was a Monke of Saint <hi>Baſil:</hi> all which was done in the middeſt of October. But this vaine ſhew of honour beeing not eſteemed by the Biſhop, was not willing to preferre the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> before his Countrey, he was traiterouſly, and cruelly ſlaine, by <hi>Ferdinands</hi> miniſters, the eighteenth of December, vpon pretence that he held intelligence with the Turkes. This accident did excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly mooue the Cardinals, who thought themſelues moſt ſacred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable. They conſidered of what importance the example was, that a Cardinall ſhould bee ſlaine vpon fained calumnies, or for ſuſpicion. And they incited the Pope, who was forward of himſelfe, ſhewing him that the Cardinall was poſſeſſour of a great treaſure, to the value of a million, which belonged to the <hi>Chamber,</hi> being the goods of a Cardinall, dead without a Will. For all theſe reſpects the Pope deputed Cardinals to take knowledge of the crime, and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and all his Miniſters of <hi>Tranſiluania,</hi> were thought to haue incurred the cenſures. Commiſſioners were ſent to <hi>Vienna</hi> to make <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> &amp; his Miniſters were thought to haue incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</note> inquiſition. And, not to returne to ſpeake of this againe, I will ſay heere, by way of anticipation, that the heat being abated, as the cuſtome is, becauſe that which was done could not be vndone, not to raiſe any greater ſtirres, the proceeding was with much conniuencie; and though the proceſſe was made as <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would, yet nothing was prooued againſt the dead man, and the purpoſe to draw the inheritance to the <hi>Chamber</hi> died, becauſe little was found, in compariſon of that which was thought, <hi>Martinuccio,</hi> a man bountifull, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſpent all in the publike ſeruice, and that which was found being diuided amongſt the Souldiers. The Pope declared <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and all thoſe who <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> is abſolued, firſt, conditionally, and then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely.</note> were not preſent at his death, to be abſolued, with this addition, if the things deduced in the Proceſſe were true. Whereof the Emperours miniſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning, as if the integrity of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> were queſtioned, the Pope made the ſentence abſolute, and thoſe onely, who were Authours of the murder, went to <hi>Rome</hi> to bee abſolued; but ſo, as if they had done a good worke. And in <hi>Hungarie</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it was held, that it was done by command from him who had intereſt, according to the vſuall ſaying, that of euery ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell hee is Authour, who receiueth profit by it. Yet this did <hi>Ferdinand</hi> no good, who ſhortly after for this and other cauſes, was chaſed out of <hi>Tranſilua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> But becauſe to ſpeake thereof, belongeth not to my purpoſe, I returne to the matter which I left.</p>
            <p>The ſeuenth day of Februarie, the next Sunday before <hi>Septuageſima,</hi> the Goſpel of the Cockle being read, <hi>Ambroſe Cigogna,</hi> or <hi>Storke,</hi> (for ſo his
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:17208:197"/>
Dutch name <hi>Pelargo</hi> is expounded) a <hi>Dominican</hi> Diuine of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Triers,</hi> preached; who, applying the name of Cockle to the heretiques, ſaid it was fit to tolerate them, when, without danger of greater miſchiefe, they could not be nooted our. This was told to the Proteſtants, as if hee had ſayd, that it was lawfull not to obſerue the faith giuen: which raiſed a great tumult. Hee defended himſelfe that hee ſpake of heretiques in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and ſayd no more then what the Goſpel it ſelfe doeth propoſe: but if he had ſayd that it was fit to extirpate them with fire, bonds, and halters, or any other way, hee ſhould haue done that which the Councell in the ſecond Seſſion did command: that he had ſpoken modeſtly, nor could a Sermon bee made vpon that Goſpel without ſaying as much. The Cardinall of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Emperours Ambaſſadours did pacifie the commotion, but with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, though it was manifeſt that the Friar ſpake not of keeping faith, not of the Proteſtants particularly, but of heretiques in generall. The Elector made this his pretence to depart, which hee was reſolued to doe before, by reaſon of ſome ſecret intelligence, which he held with the French King, as alſo to recouer his health; and ſo he departed in the midſt of February, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">The Elector of <hi>Triers</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth from <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> an opinion, that it was with the good liking of the Emperour, and with promiſe to returne quickly. Yet he paſſed not by <hi>Ispruc,</hi> nor ſpake with the Emperour.</p>
            <p>The firſt day of Lent the <hi>Stations</hi> were, by affixion, publiſhed in <hi>Trent,</hi> in the ſame manner as in <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Popes graunt, to him that viſited the Churches; which gaue entertainement to the Fathers and Diuines, who, in regard of the intermiſſion of the Congregations, wanted buſineſſe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, beeing almoſt idle, they entertained themſelues in priuate meetings, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing variouſly, ſometimes, of diſſoluing, ſometimes of continuing the Councell, according to the newes which was brought. In the beginning of March, letters came from the Electour of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> to his Ambaſſadours, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them commiſſion to proſecute their inſtances in the Councell, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing that hee was ready to goe to the Emperour in perſon; which put all men out of feare. But not long after, a generall rumor was ſpread, that the French King was confederate with the Proteſtant Princes, to make warre againſt the Emperour.

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, foure Diuines of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> and two of <hi>Argenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> came to <hi>Trent</hi> afterwards, who, with the Ambaſſadours of that Duke <note place="margin">The Diuines of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> &amp; <hi>Argentina</hi> come to the Synode.</note> did immediately deſire the Emperours Ambaſſadours, that the Synode might anſwere the propoſition alreadie made, and begin the conference. The Legate anſwered, that the nineteenth of March, a day appointed for the Seſſion, approaching, it was neceſſary to giue order for it, and to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle many other things, of which one ſhould bee, to finde a forme how to treate.</p>
            <p>Therefore that day a Congregation was made in the Legats houſe, and a <note place="margin">The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> is receiued in congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> reſolution taken to prolong the Seſſion vntill the firſt of May. In this Congregation the Ambaſſador of <hi>Portugal</hi> was receiued, who preſented his
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:17208:197"/>
               <hi>Mandat,</hi> and made a ſpeach, and was anſwered in the vſuall forme, with praiſe and thankes to the King, and words of Complement to the Ambaſſadour. But thoſe of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> ſeeing no anſwere was made to their propoſitions, and that the Legate concealed the <hi>Confeſsion,</hi> preſented by them, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſired to haue, and could not, hauing brought many printed copies, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed them vnto diuers; which raiſed much noiſe, and ſome ſaid the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued <note place="margin">The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of <hi>Wittenberg</hi> ſpread copies of their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion.</hi>

            <p>The Proteſtants, together with the Emperours Ambaſſadours, deſired often, that the action ſhould begin, which not withſtanding was deferred, ſometimes vnder pretence, that the Legate was not well in health, ſometimes vnder diuers others. The Emperours Ambaſſadours vſed all meanes to make them begin, and perſwaded the Proteſtants not to deſire an anſwere to the demaunds preſented by them, and afterwards not to deſire that the doctrine exhibited by them ſhould bee examined. But as one difficulty was remooued by the Proteſtants, ſo another was ſtill raiſed by the Preſidents, ſometimes about the manner of treating, ſometimes about the matter with which to begin. But in the end, the Proteſtants, perſwaded by <hi>Pictauius,</hi> were content to begin where the others would. Yet, for all this, nothing was done. For the Legate, though very ſicke of great paſſions of minde, was thought to faine, that hee might finde a pretence not to begin. The <hi>Nuncij</hi> were irreſolute, and the Biſhops did not agree among themſelues. For the adherents of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> Spaniards and others, mooued by the Emperours Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, deſired to proceede: but the Papalins, ſuſpecting that the end of the Imperialiſts was to come to the reformation of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> embraced all occaſions of delay. And becauſe the Dutch Biſhops were already depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by reaſon of the rumours of warre, they expected the like occaſion alſo, eſpecially becauſe the aduices of the Armes of the French King, and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of <hi>Germanie</hi> againſt the Emperour, did continue, Proteſts, and Manifeſts beeing publiſhed, which alleadged, for a cauſe, the defence of Religion, and libertie of <hi>Germany.</hi> The firſt of April, the Elector of <hi>Saxonie</hi> beſieged <hi>Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> which did render it ſelfe the third day, and the ſixt newes there of came <note place="margin">The Fathers of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and the Proteſtants depart from <hi>Trent,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the rumors of warre.</note> to <hi>Trent,</hi> and that all <hi>Tirol</hi> did arme, and meant to goe to <hi>Ispruc,</hi> there beeing an opinion, that the armie of the confederates did purpoſe to poſſeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of the paſſages of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> to hinder ſtrangers from comming into <hi>Germany.</hi> Therefore in many of the Italian Biſhops embarqued, and went downe the Riuer <hi>Adice,</hi> to goe to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erona,</hi> and the Proteſtants determined to depart.</p>
            <p>There remaining but few Prelates, and the Legate often doting, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">The Legate doteth, and the <hi>Nuncij</hi> ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> to knowe what to doe.</note> of his great infirmitie, nor being able conſtantly to reſolue, the <hi>Nuncij</hi> fearing they ſhould be alone in <hi>Trent</hi> if they expected the firſt of May, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order, wrote to <hi>Rome,</hi> deſiring to knowe what they ſhould do in theſe great ſtraits. The Pope, who already had concluded with <hi>France,</hi> nor eſteemed any more what the Emperour could doe, hauing ouer come the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties by which he was compaſſed, aſſembled the Cardinals, and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to them the aduice of the <hi>Nuncy,</hi> the maior part of whom did concurre,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:17208:198"/>
without difficulty, that the Councell ſhould bee ſuſpended. The Bull was made, and ſent to <hi>Trent,</hi> and letters addreſſed to the <hi>Nuncij,</hi> giuing them au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for the ſuſpenſion. Therefore, when they ſaw vrgent neceſſitie, they were commanded to yeeld vnto it, not putting the dignity of the Councell in danger, which ſhould be reſtored, at another, more peaceable time, nor diſſoluing it abſolutely, that they might keepe it in their power, and vſe it vpon occaſions, but ſuſpending it, for ſome yeeres. The <hi>Nuncij</hi> concealed <note place="margin">From whence they receiue order to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Councel.</note> this anſwere, and conſulted with the Emperours Ambaſſadors, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal prelates, who deſired that order ſhould be expected from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated the feare as much as they could. Notwithſtanding the Prelates, though the maior part were Spaniards, fearing their owne perſons, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Proteſtants, and not hoping, that in ſo great ſtraits, the Emperour could haue time to thinke of the Councell, gaue conſent to a ſuſpenſion. Therefore the <hi>Nuncij</hi> did intimate the publique Seſſion for the 28. of April, ſo great was their feare that they could not expect two dayes, the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe few that remained did aſſemble; and, after the Eccleſiaſticall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were ended, (for the pompes were omitted for that time) the <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> of <hi>Siponto</hi> cauſed the Decree ſo bee read; by the Secretary.

Therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that euery place, <hi>Germanie</hi> eſpecially, is on fire with diſcords, and that the Dutch Biſhops, eſpecially the Electors, were departed to make prouiſion for their Churches, it hath determined not to contend with neceſſitie, but to be ſilent vntill better times. And therefore they doe ſuſpend the Progreſſe for two yeeres, with condition, that if all be quiet before that time bee ended, the Councell ſhall bee vnderſtood to bee reſtored; but if the impediments ſhall not ceaſe at the end of two yeeres, it ſhall bee vnderſtood that the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion is taken away ſo ſoone as the impediments are remooued, without a new Conuocation of the Councell, his Holineſſe, and the holy Apoſtolique Sea, hauing giuen conſent and authoritie to this Decree. And, in the meane time, the Synode doth exhort all Chriſtian Princes and Prelates, as farre as concerneth euery one, to cauſe all the Decrees of the Councell, made vntill then, to be obſerued in their Dominions, and Churches.

But the anſwere did not ſatisfie, becauſe to <note place="margin">And their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is not eſteemed good.</note> obſerue as a law, doth preſuppoſe an obligation, and in the Decree, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is referred onely to Princes and Prelates, who are exhorted to cauſe the Decrees to bee obſerued. And for the obſeruers, a former obligation is preſuppoſed, and for matter of faith, they ſaid the anſwere could haue no place. They might haue excuſed themſelues, and ſayd, that euerything was approoued by the Pope, before it was publiſhed in the Seſſions. Neither would this haue ſatisfied, becauſe, thought it was true, yet it did not appeare. This gaue occaſion to wonder, that there ſhould bee ſuch a contention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Synode and the Proteſtants, concerning the things decreed, which the Proteſtants would haue reexamined, and the Synode would haue to bee held as concluded. For if they were not perfectly eſtabliſhed, they might bee reexamined. And they diſcourſed, that the Pope, who was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them; was to doe it, either with taking knowledge of the cauſe, or without; if without, the confirmation was a vanitie, and according to the prouerbe, that none ſhould take a potion, and another bee purged; if with it, then the Pope ought to examine them, and ſo might euery one, and referre himſelfe to his Holineſſe. In ſumme, if the force of the Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell dependeth on the Popes Confirmation, before that, they are in ſuſpence, and may be queſtioned, and diſcuſſed better, which was alwayes denied to the Proteſtants. Some did conclude, that the Decree was a declaration that the confirmation was not needfull. The Proteſtants thought not of theſe reaſons, which the ſtronger they are in the Doctrine of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo much the more the vſe of them would endammage their pretenſions. But becauſe there was more ſpeech of the validitie of this Decree in the yeere 156 when the Councel ended, that which remaineth ſhall be deferred vntill then.</p>

Though the Proteſtants had the better in mannaging the warre, yet <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> treated friendly with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> yea, went to him into his owne Territe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, deſiring nothing of him but the freedome of the <hi>Landgraue,</hi> his father in law, the liberty of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and peace of Religion. The Proteſtants Annos did ſtill proceede; and the Emperour, though hee were not ready to make reſiſtance, yet thinking he had <hi>Germany</hi> vnder his yoke; hee would not leaue any part of the domination which hee had aſſumed: and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee had treated with <hi>Maurice,</hi> went to <hi>Ispruc,</hi> to perſwade him. But the <note place="margin">The Emperor flieth from <hi>Iſprut.</hi>

               <hi>Paſſau,</hi> in the beginning of Auguſt, concerning all differences; and, for Religion, it was thus ordered: that, within ſixe moneths, a Diet ſhould bee called, to conſult how the diſcords in Religion might moſt eaſily, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly be compoſed, either by a generall or Nationall Councell, or by a Colloquie, or vniuerſall Diet of the Empire.

And the euent was iudge. For the Reformation was handled in the beginning with great heate; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it went on, for the ſpace of many moneths, very coldly; and, at the laſt, was buried in ſilence.

            <p>At that time <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> King of the Romanes, publiſhed an Edict to all <note place="margin">The King of the Romanes publiſheth an Edict againſt all innouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Religion</note> the people ſubiect vnto him, that in points of Religion, and Rites, they ſhould not innouate, but follow the ancient cuſtomes; and particularly that, in the holy Communion, they ſhould bee content to receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of bread onely.

            <p>The two yeeres of the ſuſpenſion of the Councell being expired, they treated in the Conſiſtorie what was fit to bee done. For although the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the Decree was, that the Councell ſhould be of force againe when the impediments were remooued, which did ſtill continue, by reaſon of the warres of Siena, Piemont, and others, betweene the Emperour and the French King, yet it ſeemed that any man of an vnquiet Spirit might ſay that thoſe impediments were not ſufficient, and that it was vnderſtood that the Councell was on foote againe; ſo that, to free themſelues from thoſe dangers, it might be good to make a new declaration. But wiſer men <note place="margin">It is reſolued in Rome not to ſpeak of the Councell though the two yeeres of ſuſpenſion were ended.</note> gaue counſell not to mooue the euill while it was quiet, while the world was ſilent, while neither Prince nor People demaunded the Councell, leſt by ſhewing they were afraid, they might excite others to require it.

            <p>In the yeere 1555. there was a Diet in Ausburg, which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <note place="margin">1555. A Diet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Therefore it was neceſſarie to take in hand the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of religion. Hee ſayd a generall, free, and pious Councell was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly thought the onely remedie. For the cauſe of Faith beeing common to all Chriſtians, it ought to bee handled by all: and the Emperour im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying all his forces heerein, did cauſe it to bee aſſembled, more then once. But there was no neede to ſay why no fruit came by it, it beeing well knowen to all that were preſent. Now if they deſired to prooue the ſame

But if, by reaſon of the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that occurre, they thought fit to deferre this vntill another time, they might treate of vſing other meanes. They knew not how to make vſe of a Nationall Councell, becauſe the maner, forme, and name of them were diſuſed. The Colloquies, whereof they had often made proofe, did no <note place="margin">And propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie.</note> good, becauſe both parties aymed more at priuate gaine, then publique pietie and vtilitie. Yet hee ſayd they were not to be deſpiſed now, if they would lay aſide the obſtinacie of their priuate affections; and counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to trye them once more, if the Diet did not propoſe a better way.</p>
            <p>This propoſition was made by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> with others, concerning the peace and warre with the Turkes, that it might paſſe through Germanie, and ſerue to inuite men to the Diet, to which very few were come. But it was ill expounded, in regard of his former Edict, publiſhed in his States, much contrarie to this propoſition, and more, in regard of the execution of it, hauing chaſed more then two hundred Preachers out of Bohemia. And it went to Rome alſo; where the Pope, curſing, as hee vſually did, the <note place="margin">Which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth the Pope.</note> Colloquies, and inuentors of them, complayned that there was no end of theſe difficulties, and that hee was to haue a Councell, a Colloquie, or a Diet alwayes on his backe. Hee blamed thoſe times for beeing ſo full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, prayſing former ages when the Popes might liue quietly, not beeing in feare of their authoritie. Yet hee was comforted by the perfect ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of England to his obedience, by the decrees made in his fauour, by the <note place="margin">Who is conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with the obedience of England.</note> Letters of thankes which hee receiued, and with the promiſe that a ſolemne Ambaſſage would come ere long, to thanke him perſonally for his father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clemencie and benignitie, and to promiſe him obedience. Wherewith beeing well pleaſed, hee could not chooſe but ieſt, and ſayd, that hee did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy ſome part of happineſſe, in that hee was thanked by thoſe vnto whom he owed thankes.</p>
            <p>But though the Pope had little hope of Germanie, yet, not to neglect it, nor any ouerture that might bee made, in propoſing meanes to reduce to the Church thoſe that wandred, hee ſent Cardinall <hi>Morone.</hi> for his Legate, <note place="margin">Hee ſendeth Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> to the Diet.</note> to the Imperiall Diet, with inſtructions euer to lay before them the example of England, and, by that, to exhort Germanie to know their diſeaſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſame cure; and, aboue all, to diuert all <hi>Colloquies,</hi> and treaties of religion. The Cardinall was no ſooner arriued in Ausburg, but Pope <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> died, whereof hee receiued aduiſe eight dayes after.

            <p>Before they came, <hi>Marcellus Ceruinus,</hi> Cardinall <hi>de Santa Croce,</hi> was <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Marcellus Ceruinus</hi> is created Pope, and reteineth his name.</note> elected Pope in Rome, the ninth of April; a man graue, and ſeuere by nature, and of a conſtant minde, which he was willing to demonſtrate in the firſt action of his Papacie, by retaining the ſame name, ſhewing the world that his dignitie had not changed him; contrarie to that which ſo many of his predeceſſors had done. For after the changing of the names began, becauſe Dutch men were made Popes, to whoſe names Romane
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:17208:205"/>
eares were not accuſtomed, all that followed obſerued the ſame vſe, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying thereby that they had changed their priuate affections into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and diuine cares. But this Pope, to ſhew that in his priuate eſtate hee had thoughts worthy of the Popedome, would, by retaining the ſame name, ſhew his immutabilitie. Another action of his alſo was like to this. For the capitulations made in the Conclaue beeing preſented to him, that hee might ſweare to them, hee anſwered it was the ſame thing which hee had ſworne a few dayes before, and that he would obſerue it by deedes and not by promiſes. The holy weeke which then was celebrated, and Eaſter holy dayes approching, put the Pope, by the aſſiduitie of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall ceremonies into an indiſpoſition. Yet his thoughts were ſtill fixed on the things hee had diſſeigned with many Cardinals, before his Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to which hee did euer thinke hee ſhould aſcend; and particularly hee imparted his purpoſe to the Cardinall of Mantua, to compoſe the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Religion by a Councell, which hee ſayd did not formerly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede well, becauſe a good courſe was not taken. That it was neceſſary <note place="margin">He purpoſeth to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> firſt to make an intire reformation, by which the reall differences would bee accorded; which beeing done, the verball would partly ceaſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and partly would be compoſed with ſome ſmall paines of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. That his Predeceſſors for fiue ſucceſſions, abhorred the name of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, not for any bad end, but becauſe they were perſwaded that it was ſet on foote, to pull downe the Papall authoritie. But his opinion was contrary, and that nothing could more preſerue it then that; yea, that it would bee a meanes to enlarge it. For obſeruing things paſt, euery one might ſee, that onely thoſe Popes who haue made reformations, haue aduanced and inlarged their authoritie. That the reformation did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any thing but that which was for ſhew and vanitie, not onely of no moment, but of charge and burthen; as ryots, pomps, great traines of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, exceſſiue, ſuperfluous, and vnprofitable charges, which doe not make the Papacie venerable, but rather contemned; which vanities being cut off, the true power, reputation, and credit with the world will increaſe, together with the reuenue and other ſinewes of gouernement, and aboue all, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God, which euery one may aſſure himſelfe doth worke in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of ones proper duetie.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſſignes, publiſhed in Court, were, by his wel-willers, adorned <note place="margin">And is cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Court.</note> with the titles of Pietie, loue of Peace, and Religion; but ſome, that were emulous, ſayd the end was not good; that the Pope did ground him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon Aſtrologicall predictions (following his fathers ſteps, who became great by that profeſſion) which, as ſome times, either by chance or otherwiſe, they ſucceede, ſo, for the moſt part, they are occaſions of the fall of many.

they were created Cardinals, in which caſe they were not to forſake the compunie. Theſe onely hee would imploy for <hi>Nuncij,</hi> and miniſters of buſineſſes, Gouernours of Cities, Legates, and in all other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Apoſtolique Sea. And many learned men, Inhabitants of Rome, whom himſelfe did know, were named, and others put themſelues forward to receiue this honour. The Court was full of the expectation <note place="margin">But dieth be fore anything was effected, hauing ſat but 22. dayes.</note> of many nouities; which were all buried in ſilence, becauſe <hi>Marcelius,</hi> firſt weakened by the paines he tooke in the long great ceremonies, as hath bin ſaid, afterwards taken with an apoplexie, dyed the laſt day of the month, the other aſtrologicall predictions of his father and his owhe, which were extended a yeere after that time, being not verefied.</p>
            <p>The Cardinals being aſſembled againe in the <hi>Conclaue,</hi> hee of Ausburg, aſſiſted by <hi>Morene,</hi> made great inſtance, that among the capitulations which the Cardinals were to ſweare vnto, one ſhould bee, that the future Pope ſhould, by counſell of the Colledge, call an other Synod, within <note place="margin">Two cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

And the Colledge of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals beeing full, it was capitulated that the Pope ſhould not create more then foure within two yeeres. The three and twentieth day of the next Moneth, <hi>Iohn Peter Caraffa,</hi> who called himſelfe <hi>Paulus Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> was created, the Imperialiſts reſiſtng as much as they could. For he was thought not to be the Emperours friend, in regard of the old diſtaſtes which he receiued in the King of Spaine his Court, where he ſerued eight yeares, in the life time of the Catholique King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and becauſe the poſſeſſion of the Archbiſhoprique of Naples was denyed him, a few yeares before, by the common inclination of the Barons of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Whereunto was added the ſeueritio of his manners, which made <note place="margin">Of whoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie the Court is afraid.</note> the Court fad, and put it in geater feare of reformation, then it formerly had in the treaties of the Councell. The ſtrictneſſe of his life, concerning his perſon and familie, he laid aſide immediately after his creation. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demaunded by his Steward what diet hee would haue prouided for him, hee anſwered ſuch as befitteth a Prince: and would be crowned with greater pompe then was vſuall, affecting, in all his actions, to keepe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with magnificence, and to appeare ſtately and ſumptuous. To his Nephewes and kinſmen hee was as indulgent as any of his Predeceſſors. He affected to hide his ſeueritie towards others, by ſhewing the greateſt humanitie, but within a ſhort time hee returned to his owne naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>Hee tooke it for a great glory that the three Engliſh. Ambaſſadours, <note place="margin">The Engliſh. Ambaſſadors are receiued in the firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The Ambaſſadours, were brought into it, who proſtrating themſelues at the Popes feete, did, in the name of the Kingdome, acknowledge the faults committed, relating them all in particular (for ſo the Pope would haue it) confeſſing they had beene vngratefull for ſo many benefits receiued from the Church, and humbly crauing pardon for it. The Pope did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:17208:206"/>
them, tooke them vp from the ground, and imbraced them: and, to honour their Maieſties who ſent them, gaue the title of a Kingdome to Ireland, graunting them this dignitie by the authoritie which the Pope hath from God, being placed ouer all Kingdomes, to ſupplant thoſe that are contumacious, and to build new. Men of iudgement, who then knew not the true cauſe of that action, thought it a vanitie, not ſeeing <note place="margin">The Pope gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land the title of a kingdom</note> what profit, either of authoritie or honour, it might bring to a King, to haue many titles in the Countrey which hee poſſeſſeth, conſidering that the moſt Chriſtian King is more honoured by the onely title of King of France, then if his State were diuided into as many Kingly titles as hee hath Prouinces. Neither did it then ſeeme a fitte time to ſay, hee had power from God to build vp, and ouerthrow Kingdomes. But thoſe that knew the true cauſe, did not thinke it vaine, but a ſecret, vſually pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed a long time. <hi>Henrie</hi> the Eight, after his ſeparation from the Pope, made Ireland a kingdome, and called himſelfe, King of England, France, and Ireland; which title, continued by <hi>Edward,</hi> was aſſumed by <hi>Marie,</hi> and her Husband. The Pope ſo ſoone as hee was created, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a reſolution that the title of Ireland ſhould not bee vſed by thoſe Princes, affirming conſtantly that it belonged onely to him, to <note place="margin">Which was taken before without the conſent of any Pope.</note> giue the name of a King. But it ſeemed hard to enduce England to quit that which two Kings had vſed, and the Queene, not thinking much of it, had continued. Therefore hee found a temper; that is, to diſſemble the knowledge of what <hi>Henry</hi> had done, and himſelfe to crect the Iſland into a Kingdome, that ſo the world might beleeue that the Queene <note place="margin">Popes haue often giuen that which they could not take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poſſeſſors.</note> had vſed the Title as giuen by the Pope, not as decreed by her Father. And the Popes haue often giuen that which they could not take from the poſſeſſors, and to auoyd contentions, ſome haue receiued their owne goods as gifts, and ſome haue diſſembled the knowledge of the gift, or of the pretence of the giuer. In the priuate diſcourſes betweene the Pope and the Ambaſſadours, hee found fault that the Church goods were not wholly reſtored, ſaying that by no meanes it was to bee tolerated, and that it was neceſſarie to render all, euen to afarthing; becauſe the things that belong to God can neuer bee applyed to humane vſes, and hee that withholdeth the leaſt part of them, is in continuall ſtate of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That if hee had power to grant them, hee would doe it moſt readily, <note place="margin">The Pope commandeth the reſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Church goods in England.</note> for his Fatherly affection which hee beareth to them, and for the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hee hath of their filiall obedience, but his authoritie was not ſo large, as that hee might prophane the things dedicated to GOD, and let England bee aſſured that this would bee an <hi>Anathema,</hi> and an contagion, which, by the iuſt reuenge of God, would alwayes hold the Kingdome of England in perpetuall infelicitie. He charged the Ambaſſadours to write thereof immediatly, and was not content to ſpeake of it once, but repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it as often as there was occaſion. Hee ſaid alſo plainely, that the <hi>Peter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perce</hi> ought to be payd, as ſoone as might bee, and that, according to the <note place="margin">And the pay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pence.</hi>
               </note> cuſtome hee would ſend a Collector for that purpoſe; that himſelfe had exerciſed that charge three yeeres, hauing beene ſent into England for that end, wherein hee was much edified, by ſeeing the forwardneſſe of

the people to contribute, eſpecially of thoſe of the meaner ſort; and told them often that they could not hope that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would open heauen vnto them, ſo long as they vſurped his goods vpon earth. This relation made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Queene, with many other treaties, continued ſucceeſliuely from Rome, cauſed her to imploy all her ſpirits herein; but nothing could be done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many of the Nobilitie, and of the <hi>Grandies</hi> had incorporated many of <note place="margin">The Queene maketh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

But the Cardinall of Loraine, who well knew his humour, confirmed his affection towards the French, telling him in Conſiſtorie, and in many priuate Treaties beſides, that the King did know that the Church of France had neede of reformation, and was ready to aſſiſt his Holineſſe, either by ſending Prelates to the Councell, if hee thought fit, or by any other meanes that ſhould ſeeme good vnto him.</p>
            <p>In the meane ſpace the Diet of Germany was proſecuted, not without <note place="margin">Contentions doe ariſe in the Diet of Ausburg.</note> contentions, which would haue beene greater if Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> had remayned there, as well for the negotiations hee would haue made, as for the ſuſpicions conceiued by the Proteſtants, that hee was ſent onely to oppoſe their commodities. And it was alreadie publiſhed euery where that Rome was full of hope, that Germany would quickely come vnder the yoke, as England had done. After the Cardinals departure, the firſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie was; whether the points of Religion ſhould bee diſcuſſed firſt of all; which though the Eccleſiaſtiques did contradict in the beginning, yet it was finally reſolued, by common conſent to beginne there. Wherein there were two contrary Propoſitions; One to treat of the meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it; the other to leaue euery one to his libertie: about which point there was very great controuerſie. But in the ende, all inclined to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond propoſition, not knowing how to roote out the euill which did ſtill moue, onely hoping that when the humours were quiet, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and ſuſpitions remooued, many eaſie and commodious wayes might bee found out. For this, it was neceſſary to eſtabliſh a peace, that for cauſe of Religion there might bee no more warre, and that it might bee lawfull for all the Princes and States of the Empire to follow and cauſe to bee obſerued in their Dominions what Religion pleaſed them beſt. Which reſolution, when it came to bee eſtabliſhed raiſed greater contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies. For thoſe of the <hi>Augustan Confesſion</hi> did pretend, that it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for all to accept their Doctrine, retaining the honours, States, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees which they poſſeſſed. On the contrary, the Catholiques would not haue it permitted to the Eccleſiaſtiques to change their Religion, and keepe their degree, but that if a Biſhop or an Abbot did embrace the other Religion, he ſhould looſe his dignitie. Neither would they haue it permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Cities, which ſeuen yeares ſince had receiued the decree of the
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:17208:207"/>
               <hi>Interim</hi> made in Ausburg, to returne to the <hi>Augustan Confeſſion.</hi>

            <p>Writings paſſed on both ſides concerning this, and, at the laſt, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour <note place="margin">1555 PAVL 4. CHARLES 5. MARY. HENRY. 2. But at the laſt a peace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished.</note> of either partie was abated. The Catholiques were content that the Cities ſhould doe as they pleaſed, and the Proteſtants gaue ouer their pretence concerning the Eccleſiaſtiques. And the fiue and twentieth of September the <hi>Receſſe</hi> was made, that a Generall or Nationall Councell (nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which could bee aſſembled in regard of many difficulties) beeing neceſſarie to determine lawfully the cauſes of Religion, vntill a way might bee opened vnto a friendly agreement thoughout all Germanie, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> the Catholique Princes and States, ſhould not force the Princes, Orders and States of the <hi>Augustan Confeſsion</hi> to forſake their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Ceremonies alreadie inſtituted, orto bee inſtituted in their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, nor ſhould doe any thing in contempt thereof, nor hinder them in the free vſe of that Religion: and thoſe of the <hi>Auguſtan Confeſsion</hi> ought to behaue themſelues in the ſame ſort towards <hi>Caeſar, Ferdinand,</hi> and the other Princes and States of the old Religion, as well Eccleſiaſticall as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, euery one hauing power to eſtabliſh in his owne State what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hee will, and to forbid the other. And if any Eccleſiaſtique ſhall abandon the old Religion, it ſhall bee no infamie vnto him but hee ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently looſe his Benefices, which ſhall bee conferred vpon others by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron; and the Benefices, which the Proteſtants haue already annexed to Schooles and Miniſteries of the Church ſhall remayne in the ſame ſtate. That Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction ſhall bee exerciſed no more againſt thoſe of the <hi>Auguſtan Confeſsion;</hi> but, otherwiſe, ſhall bee exerciſed according to the ancient cuſtome. The <hi>Receſſe</hi> being made, another difficultie aroſe, for the remoouing of which, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> vſing the abſolute Imperiall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of his brother, did declare with conſent ofthe Eccleſiaſticall Order, that the Titulars, Cities, and Communities, ſubiect to Eccleſiaſticall Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who haue adhered many yeeres to the <hi>Auguſtan Confeſsion,</hi> and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued long ſince the Rites and Ceremonies thereof, and doe obſerue them ſtill, may not bee compelled by their Princes to change them, but may continue in them vntill a generall concord in Religion, which ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Paul</hi> vnderſtanding of this <hi>Receſſe</hi> of <hi>Ausburg,</hi> was exceeding <note place="margin">Of which the hope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth to the Emperors Embaſſador, and Cardinall of Ausburg.</note> angry; Hee complained thereof to the Emperours Ambaſſadour, and to the Cardinall of Ausburg, reprehending <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for ſuffering a treaty in matters of Religion, without the knowledge of the Apoſtolique Sea, and threatning that in due time hee would make the Emperour and that King know to their griefe, how they had offended him: hee exhorted them to preuent it, by reuoking and diſſallowing the things graunted, that hee might haue no occaſion to proceed, as hee meant to doe, not onely, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> but euen againſt them alſo, as Abettors: offering to aſſiſt them, in caſe they ſhould doe it by authoritie and armes, and to command all Chriſtian Princes, vpon paynes and cenſures, to aide them with all their forces. He was not ſatisfied with the Ambaſſadours anſwere, who alleaged the ſtrength of the Proteſtants, the warre againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> in which hee was like to bee priſoner in Iſpruc, and the Oathes taken. For the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:17208:207"/>
Oathes, hee anſwered that hee freed and abſolued them, yea, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to obſerue them. To the reſt hee ſayd, that in Gods cauſe, one muſt not proceed according to humane reſpects. That the Emperour was in danger by Gods permiſſion, becauſe he did not what hee could and ought to doe, to reduce Germanie to the obedience of the Apoſtolicall Sea: that this is but a token of Gods anger, and that hee muſt expect greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment if hee take not warning by it: but carrying himſelfe as a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Chriſt vndauntedly, and without worldly reſpects, he ſhall obtaine all manner of victorie, as the examples of the times paſt doe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p>The fame was that the Pope was mooued to ſay ſo, not onely by his owne inclination, but by the perſwaſion of the Cardinall of Ausburg, who was diſpleaſed with the libertie granted to the <hi>Confeſsioniſts.</hi> It is certaine that <hi>Paul,</hi> being of an high ſpirit and vaſt thoughts, did aſſure himſelfe that he could redreſſe all the diſorders, by his Papall authoritie onely, nor had need of any Prince herein. Therefore hee neuer ſpake with Ambaſſadours but <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had vaſt thoughts, and was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding proud.</note> hee thundred in their eares, that hee was aboue all Princes, that he would not that any of them ſhould bee too domeſticall with him, that hee could change Kingdomes, that hee was ſucceſſor of him who hath depoſed Kings and Emperours, and did often repeate, for a beginning of authoritie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed by him, that hee had made Ireland a Kingdome, and went on ſo farre, that, in Conſiſtorie, and at his Table publiquely, in the preſence of many, hee ſaid, he would not haue any Prince for his Companion, but all ſubiects vnder his foote (ſo hee ſayd, ſtriking it againſt the ground) as it is fit, and as it is his will who hath built the Church, and hath placed them in this degree. And ſometimes he would ſay, that, rather then we would doe any thing baſely, we would die, ouerthrow all, and ſet the whole world on fire.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth was naturally of a loftie mind and courage, and truſted much in his knowledge and good fortune, which did accompany him in all his actions: whereunto the power and fortune of the Papacie being added, hee thought euery thing was eaſie. But two humours did flore in him by turnes; one, which by cuſtome to make vſe of Religion in all his attempts, did induce him to imploy his Spirituall Authoritie: the other was put into him by <hi>Charles Caraffa,</hi> his Nephew, who being valiant, and exerciſed in warre, made Cardinall of a Souldier, did retaine his marrial ſpirits, and perſwaded him to vſe his temporall power, ſaying, that the one without the other is deſpiſed, but, beeing ioyned, are inſtruments of great matters. The circumſpect old man, knew well that the Spirituall is made weaker, when it is manifeſted that there is neede of the Temporall. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euer intent to make his name great, ſometimes hee gaue eare to his Nephew, and ſometimes hee beleeued himſelfe more. In the one lice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to vſe the Temporall ſecretly, and the Spirituall openly, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with this, hee might adde, or omit the other, as hee ſhould lice adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the euents.

the Cardinall <hi>Torrnon</hi> went thither, with whom it was concluded, with the ſame ſecrecy. The principall captiulation whereof was, the gayning of the Kingdome of Naples for a yonger ſonne of the King, with great enlargement of the bounds of the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate; whoſe confines were to be S. <hi>Germano, Gerigliano,</hi> and, on the further ſide of the <hi>Apennine,</hi> the Riuer <hi>Peſcara,</hi> beyong <hi>Beneuentum:</hi> and ſome things beſides were yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto for the Popes benefit.</p>
            <p>The Pope alſo that he might haue a prop to leane on in both courſes, thought it neceſſary to make a promotion of Cardinals, dependants on himſelfe, men of courage, who would not bee afrayd to proſecute hisdiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeignes, and imploy themſelues in any hard enterpriſe. Hee began to ſpeake of this promotion but a few dayes before hee made it; which grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">And createth Cardinals, contrary to his Oath.</note> the Cardinals, for that hee would contradict the Capitulation which he had ſworne: and the Imperialiſts, aboue all, conſidering the qualitie of the perſons to be promoted, purpoſed to oppoſe. The twentieth of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, the Pope being entred into the Conſiſtorie, ſayde, ſo ſoone as hee ſate downe, that he would not giue audience to any that day, becauſe hee had greater matters to propoſe. Euery one vnderſtanding by this that his meaning was to create new Cardinals, the Cardinall of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> went to his ſeate, to ſpeake with him; and the Pope refuſing, and the Cardinall not deſiſting, hee ſet his hand on his breſt, and thruſt him from him. All being ſet, the Pope began to complaine of thoſe who reported hee could make but foure Cardinals, in regard of that which hee had ſworne in the <hi>Conclaue,</hi> and ſaid, that this was to binde the Popes authoritie, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute; that it is an Article of Faith that the Pope cannot bee bound, and much leſſe can bind himſelfe; that to ſay otherwiſe was a manifeſt hereſie; from the guilt whereof he did abſolue thoſe that were faultie, becauſe hee thought they did not ſpeake obſtinately: but hereafter if any ſhall ſay the ſame, or the like, againſt the authoritie giuen him by God, hee will giue order that the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> ſhall proceed. Hee added, that hee would make Cardinals, and would not haue any contradiction, becauſe hee wanted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for imployment, which hee could not put vpon them, becauſe euery one had his proper faction: that it was fit to promote men of learning, and of exemplarie life, to imploy them for reformation of the Church, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Councell, whereof it was high time to treate ſeriouſly, which he would propoſe with the firſt occaſion. But now hee would name vnto them the perſons to bee promoted to the Cardinalitie (a thing not to bee deferred any longer) that they hauing a conſultiue voyce; might put to his conſideration what was for the good of the Church; wherein they ſhould bee heard; and that they ſhould not beleeue they had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſiue voyce, becauſe that belonged onely to him. Hee propoſed ſeuen perſons: in which number onely one was his kinſman, and another of the <hi>Theatine Congregration:</hi> the others were men of much fame, either for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or for the negotiations of the Court Amongſt theſe was <hi>Iohannes Groperus,</hi> of Collen, of whom often mention hath beene made; who knowing hee would not liue long, thinking to honour his memorie much more by refuſing a dignity, deſired euen by great Princes, then by keeping

it a few dayes, which would giue matter of diſcourſe to thoſe that were emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of him, hee ſent the Pope many thankes, together with his excuſe, and refuſing the ornaments, would neither haue the name, nor the title. The Cardinals were created the next Sunday before the league was concluded with <hi>France,</hi> which was the 15. of that moneth.</p>
            <p>At this time Cardinall <hi>Poole,</hi> who for many reſpects of ſucceſſion, and <note place="margin">Card <hi>Poole,</hi> ordained Prieſt and made Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>

They beſeeched him that they might not be in worſe eſtate then other Germans, and that Miniſters of the Church might teach and diſtribute the Sacraments, according to the Euangelicall and Apoſtolicall doctrine; and that the Schoole-maſters ſhould not bee ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed vntill their cauſe were heard, according to iuſtice; offering, vpon theſe conditions, to aduenture their liues and goods, to giue him content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

            <p>But the Pope hauing layd the foundations before rehearſed, applying himſelfe to ſpirituall matters, thought it neceſſary to gaine credit with the world; which could not bee done, if it did not appeare by deedes, not by words onely, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was reformed.

               </note> Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> to his ſubiects, hee entred into a great rage againſt him: and hee put this amongſt other things, for which hee deſſeigned to make prouiſion at once, beeing full of hope that euery thing would bee eaſie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, if the Court were reformed, and was not troubled though hee ſaw the number of abuſes to increaſe. For a few dayes after the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Polonia,</hi> comming expreſly to congratulate his Holineſſe for his aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Popedome, made fiue demands in the name of the King and the Kingdome. To celebrate the Maſſe in the Polonian tongue.

That the paiment of <hi>Annates</hi> might bee taken away. And that they might call a Nationall Councell to reforme the proper abuſes of the Kingdome, and to reconcile the variety of opinions. Hee heard theſe demands with vnſpeakable impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and ſet himſelfe to deteſt them moſt bitterly, ſpeaking againſt them, one after another, with infinite vehemencie. And, for concluſion hee ſayd, that a generall Councell in <hi>Rome</hi> would cauſe the hereſies and bad opinions
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:17208:210"/>
of many to bee knowen, alluding to what was done in <hi>Germany, Auſtria,</hi> and <hi>Bauaria.</hi> And beeing for theſe reaſons almoſt reſolute in himſelfe, (or at the leaſt, willing to ſeeme ſo) that it was neceſſary to call a Councell, hee told all the Ambaſſadours that they ſhould ſignifie to their Princes his purpoſe to make a Lateran Councell, like vnto that which is ſo famous. And hee ſent <hi>Nuncij</hi> to the Emperour and the French King, to exhort them to peace, <note place="margin">Which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him ſpeake of hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Councel.</note> though in <hi>France</hi> hee had a more ſecret negotiation. Hee gaue commiſſion alſo to treate with them of the Councell; and ſayd in the Conſiſtory, in a long diſcourſe, (as he was very copious) that it was neceſſary to celebrate it quickly, ſeeing that beſides <hi>Bohemia, Pruſsia,</hi> and <hi>Germanie,</hi> which were much infected (for thoſe were his words) <hi>Polonia</hi> alſo was in danger. That in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> they were well affected in Religion, but the Clergie was <note place="margin">Hee is angry with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> French King.</note> badly vſed. That which hee principally reprehended in <hi>France,</hi> was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of the Tenths, which the King made the Clergie ordinarily pay.

            <p>Hee did not forbeare to ſay, that the Emperour was an heretike; that in the beginning hee fauoured the innouators of <hi>Germanie,</hi> to depreſſe that holy Sea, and to make himſelfe Lord of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of all <hi>Italie;</hi> that hee held <hi>Paul</hi> the third in perpetuall trouble, and that he ſhould not doe the like to him. Hee added, that although hee might remedie all theſe inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by his owne authority, yet, not to lay ſo great a burden vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, hee would not doe it without a Councell; that hee had called it in <hi>Rome,</hi> and named it the <hi>Lateran;</hi> that hee had giuen Commiſſion to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie it to the Emperour and French King in courteſie, but not to haue their conſent or counſell, becauſe his will was they ſhould obey; that he was aſſured it would pleaſe neither of them, becauſe it is not for their purpoſe, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as they doe, and that they will ſay many things againſt it, to diſturbe it. But hee will call it whether they will or no, and make knowen what that Sea can doe, when it hath a Pope of courage. The 26. of May, the anniuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his Coronation, all the Cardinals and Ambaſſadours dining with him, according to cuſtome, hee began, after dinner, to diſcourſe of the Councel, and that his reſolution was to celebrate it by all meanes in <hi>Rome,</hi> and that in courteſie, hee gaue notice thereof to the Princes, and that the high wayes may be made ſecure for the Prelates. But if no Prelates would come thither, yet hee would hold it with thoſe onely who are in Court, becauſe hee well knew what authority he had.</p>
            <p>While the Pope was buſie about the reformation, newes came to <hi>Rome,</hi> that a truce was concluded the fifth of February betweene the Emperour <note place="margin">But moſt of all for the truce conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betweene thoſe two Princes.</note> and French King, by the mediation of Cardinall <hi>Poole,</hi> who did interpoſe in the name of the Queene of <hi>England:</hi> which made the Pope amazed, and the Cardinall <hi>Caraffa</hi> much more, hauing beene treated, and concluded without them. The Pope was diſpleaſed, principally for the loſſe of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and for the danger which it brought, if thoſe two Princes were

               </gap>, it ſeemed that fiue yeeres, in the decrepit age of his Vncle, did quite take from him all occaſions to chaſe the Spaniard out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples,</hi> whom he ſo much hated. Yet the Pope, not looſing cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rage, made ſhew of ioy for the truce, but ſaid hee was not fully ſatisfied with it, becauſe a peace was neceſſary, in regard of the Councel, which hee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to celebrate, which he was reſolued to treat, and, for that end, to ſend Legates to thoſe Princes, beeing aſſured to conclude it, becauſe hee would imploy his authority. For hee would not bee hindered in the gouernment of the Church, committed to him by CHRIST. To the Emperour hee ſent <note place="margin">Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth his paſſion and ſendeth Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates to them both, to treat a peace, but intendeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vvar.</note> 
               <hi>Scipio Rebiba,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and to the French King, Cardinall <hi>Caraffa,</hi> his nephew. This went with all ſpeede, and to the other order was giuen to goe ſlowly. <hi>Rebiba</hi> had inſtruction to exhort the Emperour to amend <hi>Germany,</hi> which was not doen vntill then, becauſe none had proceeded a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> right in that enterpriſe. Hee knew the detects of his predeceſſors, who, to ſtop the reformation of the Court, did hinder the good progreſſe of the Councel. But contrarily he was reſolued to promote the reformation, and to celebrate a Councel in his owne preſence, and to begin with this poynt; aſſuring himſelfe that when they ſhould ſee the abuſes taken away, for which they haue ſeparated themſelues from the Church, and remaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious ſtill, they will deſire, and runne to receiue the decrees and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions which the Councell will make; where ſhall be reformed, not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally, but really, the Head, members, Clergie, Laitie, Princes, and people. To doe ſo good a worke, a truce of fiue yeeres is not ſufficient, becauſe there are no leſſe ſuſpicions in truces then in warre; and one muſt euer bee ready to prouide againſt the time when they end; that a perpetuall peace is neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to remooue all malice and ſuſpicions, that all may bend themſelues ioyntly, without worldly reſpects, to that which concerneth the vnion, and reformation of the Church. He gaue the like inſtruction to <hi>Caraffa,</hi> and was content it ſhould be publiſhed, by giuing out ſome copies of it.</p>
            <p>The Court did generally thinke that the Pope ſpake ſo often and ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly of the Councel, that no man elſe might propoſe it vnto him, and did threaten the Princes, and all the world with it, to make them abhorre it. But afterwards it was knowen that he deſeigned to free himſelfe by another way, from the trouble giuen to his predeceſſours. For when the reformation onely of the Pope, of the Court, of the exempted and priuiledged perſons, dependants of the Popedome, was propoſed, euery Prince, people and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, in regard nothing was to bee handled that concerned them, was forward to ſollicite the Councell; but hee propoſing the reformation of the Clergie, Laitie, and eſpecially of the Princes, with a moſt ſeuere <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which he deſeigned to inſtitute, he made them all equall ſo that himſelfe was not in queſtion onely, but other likewiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this was a ſecret by which hee meant to hold all men in feare, and himſelfe in reputation of integrity, and worth. And, concerning the Councel, hee meant to gouerne himſelfe according to the coniunctures, yet euer holding this point conſtantly, to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate it in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, to returne to the Legates, hee gaue his nephew a large inſtruction,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:17208:211"/>
to trie the Kings minde, and, if hee ſaw him reſolute to obſerue the truce, to thunder into his eares the ſame leſſon of the Councel: and to <hi>Rebiba</hi> he gaue order to gouerne himſelfe as hee ſhould receiue aduice from his nephew. <hi>Caraffa</hi> caried to the King, the Sword and Hat, which the Pope had bleſſed on Chriſtmas day at night, according to the cuſtome. Of the Peace hee made no mention, but repreſented to the King, that howſoeuer the league was not violated by the truce of fiue yeeres, yet it was made of no force, to the great danger of his Vncle and of his family, and that they had already ſome taſte thereof, by that which the Spaniards had done. Hee recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him, in moſt effectuall termes Religion, and the Papacie, to which his predeceſſours gaue ſingular protection, and the Pope himſelfe and his family, much deuoted to his Maieſtie. The King was not auerſe, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned doubtfull, conſidering the Popes age, who might die when hee ſhould haue moſt neede of him. <hi>Caraffa</hi> perceiued this, and found a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, <note place="margin">The French King breaketh the truce at the Popes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> promiſing that the Pope ſhould create ſo many Cardinals, partiall for <hi>France,</hi> and enemies to <hi>Spaine,</hi> that hee ſhould euer haue a Pope on his ſide. The Cardinals perſwaſions, and the promiſe of the promotion, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution from the oath of the truce, which he gaue in the Popes name, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the negotiation of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> and his brother, made the King reſolue to mooue warre, though the Princes of the <hi>Blood,</hi> and all the <hi>Grandies</hi> of the Court abhorred the infamie of breaking the truce, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing abſolution from the oath. The concluſion beeing made, <hi>Caraffa</hi> recalled the Legate ſent to the Emperour, who was arriued at <hi>Maſtric,</hi> and cauſed him to come into <hi>France,</hi> though he was but two dayes iourney diſtant from <hi>Caeſar:</hi> which made the Emperour, and the King his ſonne beleeue, that in <hi>France,</hi> ſome thing was concluded againſt them.</p>
            <p>The Popes diſtaſts, againſt the Emperor, and his ſonne, did dayly increaſe. <note place="margin">The Pope proceedeth ſeuerely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Colonneſi.</note> He made a moſt ſeuere proceſſe againſt <hi>Aſcanius Colonna,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> his ſonne, for many offences, which hee pretended to bee done againſt the Apoſtolique Sea, ſo long ſince, as when <hi>Clement</hi> was beſieged, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards againſt <hi>Paul</hi> the third, and <hi>Iulius,</hi> and by <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the State of the Church: and, relating in Conſiſtorie all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries done of old, by the Colonneſi, againſt the Apoſtolique Sea, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate <hi>Aſcanius</hi> and <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> depriue them of all dignitie and fee, with cenſures againſt thoſe that gaue them aſſiſtance, or fauour, and did confiſcate all their poſſeſſions within the State of the Church, and gaue them to the Count <hi>Montorius,</hi> his Nephew, with the title of Duke of <hi>Pagliano. Marcus Antonius,</hi> retiring into the Kingdome, was receiued, and ſometimes <note place="margin">Who retire into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and make excurſions vpon their lands.</note> made excurſions vpon his owne lands, with ſome few Souldiers, which much prouoked the Pope; who thinking his nods were commandements vnto all, able to terrifie euery one, hee could not endure to bee ſo little eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at <hi>Naples,</hi> his Countrey, where hee would haue beene thought to bee omnipotent. Hee thought in the beginning, by talking lauiſhly of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and of the King, to make them deſiſt from fauouring the Colonneſi, and therefore ſpake very often diſgracefully of them, in the preſence of all ſorts of perſons, but moſt willingly when any Spaniſh Cardinall was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and, at laſt, commanded it ſhould be written vnto them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:17208:211"/>
None of theſe proofes taking effect, hee proceeded further, and the three and twentieth day of Iuly made the <hi>Fiſcal,</hi> and <hi>Siluester Aldobrandinus,</hi> the Conſiſtoriall Aduocate, appeare in the Conſiſtory, who declared that his Holineſſe hauing excommunicated, and depriued <hi>Marcus Antonius Colonna,</hi> and prohibited vnder the ſame cenſures, all ſorts of perſons to aſſiſt or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour him, and it being notorious that the Emperour, and King <hi>Philip,</hi> his <note place="margin">The Pope maketh ſhew that he will proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperor, and his ſonne.</note> ſonne, had furniſhed him with horſe, foote, and money, they were fallen into the puniſhments of the ſame ſentence, and had loſt their Territories, which they held in <hi>Fee.</hi> Therefore they deſired that his Holineſſe would proceed to a declaratory ſentence, and giue order for execution. The Pope anſwered that he would aduiſe of it, by the counſell of the Cardinals, and giuing them leaue to depart, he propoſed in Conſiſtory what was fit to bee done, in a caſe of ſo great importance. The French Cardinals ſpake with much honour of the Emperour, and King <hi>Philip,</hi> but ſo that the Pope was more prouoked. The Imperialiſts vſed words of an ambiguous ſence, fit to gaine time. The Theatini, the Popes owne Cardinals, ſpake magnificently of the Papall authoritie, and of the worth and wiſedome of his Holineſſe, who onely knew how to finde a remedy for that maladie, praiſing all that he had done, and referring themſelues vnto him for all the reſt. The Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory being diſmiſſed without a reſolution, the Pope knew that either hee muſt yeeld, or come to a warre; from which beeing not auerſe, in regard of his naturall diſpoſition, full of courage and hopes, aduice came fitly to him from his Nephew, of what was concluded in <hi>France.</hi> So that the diſcourſes of reformation and Councels were turned into parleys of money, Souldiers, and intelligences; of which things, as not pertaining to my purpoſe, I will onely ſay as much as may ſhew what the Popes minde was, and how much he was addicted to a true, or, at leaſt to a colourable reformation of the <note place="margin">Prouideth for warre.</note> Church. The Pope armed the Citizens, and inhabitants of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the moſt part, artiſans, and ſtrangers, to the number of 5000, diſtributing them vnder the Heads of the <hi>Rioni,</hi> for ſo they were called: hee cauſed many of his Cities to bee fortified, and put gariſons in them; and the French King ſent <note place="margin">Wards or precincts.</note> him, at his inſtance, 3000. Gaſcons, by ſea, that hee might ſubſiſt while the royall Army was prepared.</p>
            <p>In theſe negotiations, and preparations for warre, the Pope impriſoned <note place="margin">And impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth many Cardinals &amp; Barons vpon ſuſpicion, and King <hi>Philip</hi> his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</note> many Cardinals, Barons, and others, vpon ſuſpicion: as alſo <hi>Carſillaſſo di Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ioannes Antonius Taſsis,</hi> the Emperours Poſt-maſter.

<pb n="404" facs="tcp:17208:212"/>
ſhould haue been done againſt him; but hauing made treaties, mooued ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, <note place="margin">1557 PAVL 4. CHARLES 5. MARY.

And the Pope ſtill continuing to make prouiſion, the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> being reſolued that it was better to aſſault then to bee aſſaulted, ſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other proteſtation againſt him, that, the King hauing endured ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, knowing that the intention of his Holineſſe was to diſpoſſeſſe him of the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and beeing aſſured, that, to this end, hee had, made a league with his enemies, could not continue in thoſe termes: and therefore in regard his Holineſſe did deſire warre, hee did denounce it againſt him, and would begin it quickly, proteſting that the calamities thereof could not be imputed to him, and laying the blame vpon the Pope. But if he deſired peace, he did offer it likewiſe vnto him, with all readineſſe. The Pope ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſhew to deſire peace, but anſwering onely in generall termes, to gaine time, the Duke began to make warre the fourth of September, and in the yeere 1556. poſſeſſed himſelfe of almoſt all <hi>Campania,</hi> holding it in the <note place="margin">For which cauſe he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</note> name of the next Pope, and came ſo neere to <hi>Rome,</hi> that he put all the Citie in feare, and made them ſtrengthen and fortifie it. And the Pope, to teach the Gouernours of ſtrong places what they ought to doe in ſuch caſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled all the religious perſons, of what ſtate or qualitie ſoeuer, to carry earth with a doſſer on their ſhoulders, to raiſe the bulwarkes. Amongſt other places which had need of Rampards, one was neere the gate of the people, at the end of the way called <hi>Flaminia,</hi> where there is a Church of our Ladie, <note place="margin">The Pope ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, and purpoſeth to pull downe a Church of great deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of much deuotion; which the Pope purpoſing to pull downe, the Duke ſent to pray him to let it ſtand, giuing his word and oath that he would make no vſe of the opportunitie of that place. But the greatneſſe of the Citie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects and dangers, counſelled him, not aſſayling <hi>Rome,</hi> to vndertake ſmaller enterpriſes.</p>
            <p>It gaue much matter of diſcourſe, that, this yeere, <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor <note place="margin">The Emperor quitteth the world.</note> parted from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and paſſed into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to betake himſelfe to a priuate life in a ſolitary place; ſo that they made a compariſon betweene a Prince, trained vp, from his infancie, in the negotiations and affaires of the world, who at the age of little more then fifty yeeres, had reſolued to quit the world and onely to ſerue God, changed from a mighty Prince, to a meane religious perſon, and one, who had formerly abandoned the Eiſcopal charge, to retire into a Monaſtery, and now, being at the age of 80. yeeres, and made Pope, did wholly addict himſelfe to pomp and pride, and endeauoured to ſet all <hi>Europe</hi> on fire with warre.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the yeere 1557. the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> paſſed into <hi>Italy,</hi>

Cardinals; which not beeing according to the meaning, and the end agreed on, neither for the number, nor qualitie of the perſons, his excuſe was, that hee was ſo <note place="margin">The Pope createth ten Cardinals.</note> neerely conioyned with his Maieſtie, that his dependants would bee as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable to the King, as the Frenchmen themſelues, and that he might aſſure

himſelfe that they were all for him; and that he could not then make a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter promotion, ſeeing the number was ſo great already, arriuing to 70. which would quickely bee diminiſhed, by remoouing ſome rebels, and putting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt men in their roomes; which hee meant of thoſe who were already in the Caſtle, and others againſt whom he had a deſſeigne, as well for matter of State, as of Religion.

            <p>Hee depriued alſo Cardinall <hi>Poole</hi> of his Legation of <hi>England,</hi> and cited him to appeare in the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing alreadie impriſoned his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward friend, as one of his complices, <hi>Thomas S.

And the oppoſition which hee made againſt him in the Conclaue, to hinder him from being Pope, was thought to haue no better ground. The new Legat, a man of great integritie, had the ſame conceits, who, though hee tooke vpon him the name of Legat, not to anger the Pope, yet in nine moneths that he liued, after he had the croſſe of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, hee did neuer exerciſe the Charge, but bare the ſame reſpect towards <hi>Poole,</hi> as before.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being come into <hi>Italy,</hi> made warre in <hi>Piemont,</hi> with purpoſe to continue it in <hi>Lumbardie,</hi> and ſo to diuert the armes taken vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope: But the Popes ardent deſire to aſſaile the Kingdome of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> did not permit him. The Frenchmen knew the difficulties, and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> with ſome principall Commanders, went to <hi>Rome</hi> by poſt, to make the Pope vnderſtand, what the reaſons of warre did perſwade. In whoſe preſence all being conſulted on, and the Popes reſolution not giuing place to any other deliberation, it was neceſſary to yeeld vnto him.

army of the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> approaching <hi>Rome,</hi> not afraid of the French, which <note place="margin">1557 PAVL 4. FERDINAND. MARY. HENRY 2. The Pope is terrified by the approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> The battell of S. <hi>Quintin.</hi>
               </note> was entertained in <hi>Abruzzo,</hi> and the Pope vnderſtanding the ſurprize and ſacke of <hi>Signea,</hi> the ſlaughter of many, and the danger in which <hi>Pagliano</hi> was, he related all in Conſiſtorie, with many teares; adding, that he did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly expect martyrdom, the Cardinals marueiling that he ſhould paint out the cauſe to them, who vnderſtood the trueth, as if it had bin of CHRIST, whereas it was profane, and proceeded from ambition, and ſay it was the principall ſinew, and myſtery of the Papacie.</p>
            <p>When the Popes affaires were in the greateſt ſtraits, the French Kings Army had ſuch a great ouerthrow neere to S. <hi>Quintin,</hi> that hee was forced to recall the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and his forces, for the ſafety of the Kingdome; let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Pope know his ineuitable neceſſitie, giuing him leaue to take what counſell ſeemed beſt for him, and ſending him backe the hoſtages. The Pope refuſed to let <hi>Guiſe</hi> returne, whereupon there beeing a great conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Maketh the French King recall the D of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and his forces.

In the end of that moneth, the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> approached <hi>Rome,</hi> which he had taken but for want of courage. His retreat was aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the baſeneſſe of his minde, who publikely ſayd, that hee feared, that if <hi>Rome</hi> had been ſacked, the Armie would haue been ſcattered, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> might haue taken <hi>Rome,</hi> and did not.</note> expoſed to danger, without forces or defence. But ſecretly hee ſaid, that beeing in the ſeruice of a King, who bare great reuerence to that place, hee refrained to doe it, becauſe he knew not whether the action would haue been approoued. Finally, a compoſition was made the fourteenth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember betweene <hi>Alua</hi> and the <hi>Caraffi,</hi> the warre hauing continued a whole <note place="margin">But made a baſe compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition with the Pope.</note> yeere. In the capitulations the Pope would not haue <hi>Colonna,</hi> nor any of his ſubiects comprehended, nor any word inſerted, to ſhew, that hee had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in impriſoning the Emperours Miniſters, but maintained moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, that the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> ought to come to <hi>Rome</hi> to aske pardon, and receiue abſolution; ſaying plainely, that before hee would looſe one iore of this due (for ſo hee called it) he would ſee the whole world ruined: that the queſtion was not of his owne, but of Chriſts honour, which he could not preiudice, nor renounce. With this condition, and with the reſtitution of the cities taken, the controuerſie was ended. It was eſteemed a prodigie, that the very day that the Peace was concluded, there was ſuch a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of the riuer Tiber, that all the plaine of <hi>Rome</hi> was drowned, and a great part of the fortifications of the Caſtle S. <hi>Angelo</hi> was ouerthrowen. The Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> went perſonally to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſubmit himſelfe to the Pope, and receiue abſolution in the Kings name, and his owne. So it happened, <note place="margin">And goeth to <hi>Rome</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</note> that the conquerour bare the indignitie, and hee that was ouercome trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed more, then if hee had been victorious. And it was no ſmall fauour that the Pope receiued him with humanity, though hee forbare not his vſuall haughtie ſtate.</p>
            <p>The warre was no ſooner ended, but new troubles came vpon the Pope. For aduice was ſent out of <hi>France,</hi> that, the fifth of September at night, in <hi>Paris,</hi> about two hundred perſons were aſſembled in an houſe to celebrate the Communion; which beeing diſcouered by the common people, the

The Suiſſes made interceſſion for theſe; and the King, in regard of his warre with the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> (for ſo <hi>Philip</hi> was called after the reſignation of his father) hauing need of their aſſiſtance, gaue order that the proceeding againſt them ſhould bee moderate. The Pope was infinitely angry, and complained in Conſiſtory, and ſaid it was no maruell if the affaires of the <note place="margin">The Pope is angry with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> French King for vſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Proteſtants.</note> King, did not ſucceed well, becauſe he more eſteemed the aſſiſtance of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, then the fauour of God. The Pope had forgotten that, in the time of his warre, the Cardinals of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> complaining that the Proteſtant Griſons, brought to his pay, for the defence of <hi>Rome,</hi> vſed many ſcornes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Churches and Images, his Holineſſe did reprehend them, ſaying they were Angels, ſent by God, for the cuſtodie of the Citie, and of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that hee had a ſtrong hope that God would conuert them. So men iudge diuerſly of their owne intereſts, and of the facts of others. The Pope tooke occaſion hence, to call in minde two conſtitutions, which the King <note place="margin">And for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions in matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> had made the ſame yeere, which hee ſaid were againſt the liberty of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and therefore was reſolute they ſhould be abrogated. The one was pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the firſt of March, that Mariages made by ſonnes before the age of thirty yeeres compleat, and of daughters before twenty fiue, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the father, or of him in whoſe power they were, ſhould bee voyde. The other the firſt of May, that all Biſhops and Curates ſhould reſide, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paine of loſſe of the reuenues, with an impoſition of an extraordinary Subſidie, beſides the ordinarie Tenths, to pay fiue thouſand foote Souldiers. The Pope thought not of theſe things when the newes came, becauſe hee was then in warre, and had neede of the King. But this reaſon ceaſing, hee complained that he had medled euen with the Sacraments, and vnſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably burdened the Clergie. Hee ſayd it was neceſſary to prouide againſt theſe diſorders, by a Councell, which were greater then could bee obiected againſt the Clergie; that it was fit to begin the Reformation from hence; that the French Prelates durſt not ſpeake ſo long as they were in <hi>France,</hi> but beeing in a Councel in <hi>Italy,</hi> free from feare of the King, their complaints would ſoone be heard. Amongſt theſe diſtaſtes the Pope receiued ſome ioy, <note place="margin">But is well pleaſed with the diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Colloquie in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </note> that the Colloquie, begunne in <hi>Germany,</hi> to compoſe the differences in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (which troubled his Holineſſe and the Court, as all Colloquies had done) was reſolued into nothing.

For ſome of them, deſiring a perfect vnion of the Church, laboured to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile <note place="margin">1558 PAVL 4. FERDINAND. PHILIP 2. MARY.

This beeing percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Biſhop, a man wiſe, and factious, whoſe end was that the <hi>Colloquie</hi> ſhould be diſſolued without fruit, hee made the Catholiques propoſe, that the <hi>Colloquie</hi> being inſtituted onely betweene them, and the <hi>Confeſsioniſts,</hi> it was neceſſary to condemne all the ſects of the <hi>Swinglians,</hi> and of others; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the errors being vniformely condemned, the trueth would eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.

The Biſhop ſhewing to the fiue that they were contemned by the other ſeuen, perſwaded them to depart from the <hi>Colloquie,</hi> and wrote the ſucceſſe to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> concluding that they could not proceede, in regard of the departure of theſe, and that thoſe which remained would not firſt condemne the ſects. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> anſwered, that his deſire was they ſhould proceede, and that the <hi>Confeſsioniſts</hi> ſhould recall thoſe fiue that were departed, and the Catholiques bee in the meane ſpace content to begin and diſcuſſe the controuerſed Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. The Biſhop ſeeing that he had loſt this point, perſwaded the Catholike Collocutors to write to the King, that it was not iuſt to begin the treatie, if all the Proteſtants were not vnited, becauſe it would be neceſſary to treat againe with the abſent, that which was concluded with the preſent, and ſo to take double paines. They all retired, without expecting any anſwere, and each partie blamed the other, excuſing it ſelfe vpon the reaſons aforeſaid.</p>

            <p>Another accident made the world know that he had not moderated the haughtineſſe of his minde The Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> in the yeere 1556. by his letters written to the Electors and Princes, did abſolutely giue to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> all the adminiſtration of the Empire, without reſeruing any thing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, commanding that he ſhould be obeyed by all.

                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> is inſtalled in the Empire.</note> He pretended that as the Popes confirmation doth make the Emperour, ſo the reſignation cannot be put into the hands of any but himſelfe; in which caſe it belonged to him to make what Emperour he pleaſed; alleadging that the Electors haue power granted them by the Popes fauour, to elect the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in place of him that is dead, but not in caſe of reſignation, in which it remaineth ſtill in the power of the Apoſtolike Sea; as alſo to the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">The Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him.</note> thereof are annexed all dignities reſigned vnto it.

            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> though he knew this, ſent <hi>Martin Guſman,</hi> his Ambaſſador, to giue him an account of his brothers reſignation, and his owne aſſumption, to teſtifie vnto him the reuerence hee bare him, to promiſe him obedience, and to ſignifie vnto him that he would ſend a ſolemne Ambaſſage, to treate of his Coronation.

For he being elected King of the Romans, and the election confirmed by <hi>Clement,</hi> to ſucceed after the death of the Emperour, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the Empire ſhould bee voide by death. Beſides there was a <hi>nullitie</hi> in all the actes of <hi>Francfort,</hi> as made by heretikes, who haue loſt all authoritie and power. Wherefore it was neceſſary that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould ſend a Proctor, and renounce whatſoeuer was done in that Diet, and beſeech the Pope, that hee would graciouſly bee pleaſed to make good the reſignation of <hi>Charles,</hi> and his aſſumption to the Empire, by vertue of his plenarie power, from whom he might expect all paternall grace and fauour. The Pope reſolued according to this Counſell, and ſo declared himſelfe to <hi>Guſman,</hi> giuing him three moneths to put it in execution, beyond which time hee would heare no more ſpeech of it, but himſelfe would create a new Emperor. Neither was it poſſible to remoue him, though King <hi>Philip,</hi> to fauour his vncle, ſent <hi>Francis Vargas</hi> expreſly, and after him <hi>Iohn Figaroa,</hi> to intreate him. <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> vnderſtanding this, gaue order to <hi>Guſman,</hi> that, if within three dayes after the receipt thereof, he were not admitted by the Pope, he ſhould depart, and proteſt vnto him, that <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> together with the Electors, would reſolue of that which ſhould be for the honour of the Empire: <hi>Guſman</hi> deſired au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience againe, which the Pope granted in priuate, not as vnto an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Emperour; and, hearing him relate what he had in his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that which was wrote vnto him from the Emperor, he anſwered, that the things conſidered by the Cardinals were very important, and that hee could not reſolue on them ſo ſoone; that he would ſend a <hi>Nuncio</hi> to the Imperiall Maieſtie of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and, in the meane while, if hee had commiſſion from his Maſter to depart he might doe it, and proteſt what he thought fit.

            <p>The number of thoſe who call themſelues Reformed being now increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>France,</hi> their courage did increaſe alſo; and there being a cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Summers euenings, to goe out of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes of S. <hi>German</hi> in great multitudes, to take the <hi>freſco,</hi> and to folace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with diuers kindes of ſportes, thoſe of the new Religion, in ſtead of doing ſo, began to ſing the Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> in French verſes.

Therefore ſhee exhorted the chiefe of the Nobilitie, who deſired a change, to proceede without tumult, aſſuring them that ſhee would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force any. Shee cauſed preſently an account to bee giuen to the Pope of her aſſumption, with letters of credence written to <hi>Edward Cerne,</hi> who was Ambaſſadour to her ſiſter, and was not departed from <hi>Rome.</hi> But the Pope, proceeding according to his vſuall rigour, anſwered, that that Kingdome was held in <hi>Fee</hi> of the Apoſtolike Sea; that ſhee could not ſucceede beeing <note place="margin">With whom the Pope doth preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt.</note> illegitimate; that hee could not contradict the declarations of <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeuenth, and <hi>Paul</hi> the third, that it was a great boldneſſe to aſſume the name and gouernement without him; that, for this, ſhee deſerued not to bee heard in any thing; yet beeing deſirous to ſhew a fatherly affection, if ſhee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce her pretenſions, and referre her ſelfe wholly to his free diſpoſition, hee will doe whatſoeuer may bee done with the honour of the Apoſtolike Sea. Many did beleeue that as he ſpake thus by his own inclination, ſo he was incited by the French King, who fearing a marriage betweene her and the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> might be made by the Popes diſpenſation, thought fit to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelfe by cutting off the practiſes in the very beginning. But the new Queene vnderſtanding the Popes anſwere, and wondring at the mans haſtie diſpoſition, thought it not profitable, either for her, or the Kingdome, to treate any more with him. So that the cauſe ceaſing, ſhee gaue the Nobilitie leaue to conſult what was fit to bee done for the ſeruice of God, and quiet of the Kingdome. A diſputation was held in <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> in preſence of all <note place="margin">A diſputation is held in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in matter of religion.</note> the States, betweene learned men, choſen on both ſides, which began the laſt of March, and laſted vntill the thirtieth of April: and, a Parliament being aſſembled to this end, all the Edicts of Religion made by <hi>Mary</hi> were aboliſhed, thoſe of her brother <hi>Edward</hi> reſtored, obedience taken away from the Pope, the title of the Head of the Church of <hi>England</hi> giuen to the Queene, the reuenues of the Monaſteries confiſcated; and aſſigned ſome to the Nobilitie, and ſome to the Crowne, the Images taken out of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by the people, and the Romane Religion baniſhed. Another accident happened alſo. For in the Diet of <hi>Ausburg</hi> it appearing, by the actes of the <hi>Colloquie</hi> the yeere before, diſſolued without fruit, that there was no hope
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:17208:216"/>
to doe any good by that meanes, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> tolde them hee would procure the generall Councell to be reſtored, exhorting all to ſubmit themſelues to the Decrees thereof, as beeing the way to remooue differences. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants anſwered, that they would conſent to a Councell, called, not by the Pope, but by the Emperour, to bee held in <hi>Germanie,</hi> in which the Pope ſhould not preſide, but ſhould ſubmit himſelfe to the iudgement thereof, and releaſe the Biſhops and Diuines of their oath; in which alſo the Proteſtants <note place="margin">

The Emperour knowing the difficultie to obtaine of the Pope a grant of the things propoſed, and that now hee had no meanes to negotiate with him, in regard of the controuerſie about the reſignation of <hi>Charles,</hi> and his ſucceſſion, he confirmed the accord of <hi>Paſsau,</hi> and the <hi>Receſſes</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets <note place="margin">And confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau.</hi>
               </note> following.</p>
            <p>The Pope hauing cut off all meanes to treate with the Emperour and <hi>Germanie,</hi> knew not what to ſay to this. Yet hee was more diſpleaſed with <note place="margin">Wherewith the Pope is much diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> their diſcourſe concerning the Councell, then with the libertie granted by the <hi>Receſſe,</hi> beeing reſolute not to call any Councell but in <hi>Rome,</hi> whatſoeuer ſhould happen. In this reſpect another accident was as grieuous as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; <note place="margin">But more with the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations of the peace of <hi>Cambray.</hi>
               </note> that is, the peace made at <hi>Cambray</hi> the third of Aprill, betweene the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> which was well confirmed by the marriages of the daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and of his ſiſter to the Duke of <hi>Sauoy.</hi> In which peace, amongſt other capitulations, it was agreed, that both the Kings ſhould make a faithfull promiſe to labour ioyntly that the Councell ſhould bee celebrated, the Church reformed, and the differences of religion compoſed. The Pope conſidered how goodly a ſhew the title of reformation, and the name of a Councell did make; that <hi>England</hi> was loſt, and all <hi>Germany</hi> alſo, partly by the Proteſtants, and partly by his difference with <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> that theſe two vnited Kings were much offended by him, the Spaniards by deedes and words, the French by words at the leaſt, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning none to whom he might haue refuge, that the Cardinals were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his gouernement, and his people not well affected, in regard of the incommodities of the warre, and the taxes layd vpon them. Theſe cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did ſo afflict the old Pope, that hee was vnfit to rule. Hee could not holde the Conſiſtories ſo often as hee was woont, and when hee did holde <note place="margin">So that hee became vnfit to rule.</note> them hee ſpent the moſt part of the time in ſpeaking of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and exhorting the Cardinals to fauour it, as beeing the onely way to extinguiſh hereſies.</p>
            <p>But the two Kings did not agree to procure the Councell for any ill will, or intereſts, which either of them had againſt the Pope, or Papacie, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide againſt the new doctrines, which did exceedingly increaſe, being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly heard and receiued by all men of conſcience: and, which was of more <note place="margin">The progreſſe of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med religion; and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes vſed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it.</note> importance, the male-contented, and thoſe who were deſirous of innouati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, put themſelues on that ſide, and did dayly, vnder pretence of religion,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:17208:216"/>
make ſome enterpriſes, as well in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> as in <hi>France,</hi> in regard thoſe people did loue their libertie, and had commerce with <hi>Germanie,</hi> as bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering vpon it. In the beginning of the troubles ſome ſeedes were ſowed, which that they might not take roote, the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and the French King, in his Kingdome, made many Edicts, and commanded diuers executions, whereof wee haue ſpoken in their due places. But after that the number of the Proteſtants did increaſe in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> and the Euangeliques did multiply amongſt the Suiſſes, and the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made in <hi>England,</hi> by reaſon of the often warres betweene the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and French King, either partie was forced to call Auxiliaries out of theſe three Nations, who publikely profeſſing and preaching the Reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in their quarters, by their example, and by other meanes, diuers of the people became of their opinion. It is certaine, that this compelled <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, to attempt the bringing in of the Spaniſh <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> ſeeing that other remedies did not preuaile, though hee was partly forced to deſiſt, for the cauſes before related. And <hi>Henry</hi> the French King, gaue the Biſhops authoritie to puniſh heretiques; a thing neuer vſed before in that Kingdome. And although in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> from the firſt Edict of <hi>Charles,</hi> vntill this time of the peace, there were hanged, beheaded, buried aliue, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to the number of fifty thouſand, and very many put to death in <hi>France,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In the Low Countries 50000 were executed for religion in a ſhort time, and very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in France.</note> yet both places were then in worſe caſe then euer. This made the Kings to thinke ioyntly of finding a remedie, by the great perſwaſion of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> for the French, and of <hi>Granuel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arras</hi> for the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, who being in <hi>Cambray,</hi> from October vntill Aprill, with other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the two Kings, to treate a peace, did conferre particularly amongſt themſelues, how that doctrine might be rooted out; and were afterwards the chiefe inſtruments of whatſoeuer did happen in both States. The cauſe they <note place="margin">Whereof the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> and <hi>Granuel,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Arras</hi> were cauſes.</note> alledged to be the zeale of religion, and the ſeruice of their Princes: but it was vniuerſally beleeued, that it was rather ambition, and a deſeigne to enrich themſelues by the ſpoyles of thoſe who were to be condemned.</p>
            <p>The peace beeing made, the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to begin to giue ſome order, not being able to bring in the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> openly, thought to doe it obliquely, <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, that hee might more eaſily bring in the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note> by the Biſhops. But there beeing but two Biſhopricks in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, <hi>Cambray,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trect,</hi> and the reſidue of the Clergie ſubiect to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and thoſe two Biſhoprickes alſo ſubiect to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Arch-biſhops, to whom appeales could not be denied, ſo that he could not worke his will by meanes of them, hee thought fit to free all that Clergie from the ſubiection of Biſhops, who were not his ſubiects, and to inſtitute three Arch-biſhoprickes in thoſe Countries, <hi>Meclin, Cambray,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trect,</hi> and to erect into Biſhoprickes, <hi>Anwerp, Balduck, Gant, Bridges, Ipre,</hi> S. <hi>Omar, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, Harlem, Middleburgh, Lewarden, Groninghe, Ruremond,</hi> and <hi>Dauenter;</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing vnto them, for reuenewes, ſome rich Abbies. Hee cauſed the Pope to approoue all this by his <hi>Bull,</hi> dated the ninth of May the ſame yeere. The pretence for doing of this was, that formerly thoſe Countries, beeing not much inhabited, did not neede a greater number of Biſhops, but now the multitude of people, and dignitie of the Cities did require they ſhould bee honoured with Eccleſiaſticall titles. Yet the Nobilitie and Comminalty did
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:17208:217"/>
imagine it was an art to bring in the <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> in which opinion they were confirmed when they ſaw the Popes Bull. For, according to the vſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> to enlarge their power or profit in euery bargaine, he alledged, for a cauſe of that new inſtitution, that that Countrey was compaſſed, and, as it were, beſieged by Schiſmatiques, who did not obey him, the Head of the Church, ſo that the true faith was in great danger by the fraudes and inſidiations of the Heretiques, if new and good Gardians were not placed ouer them. This occurrence made the Nobilitie to adhere together, and to thinke how to make reſiſtance before there was meanes to compell them by force of armes. <note place="margin">Which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to pay tribute.</note> They reſolued therefore not to pay tribute, vntill the Spaniſh Souldiers were remooued out of the Countrey, and began to incline more to the new opinion, and to fauour it: which cauſed the other troubles which ſhall bee ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>But the French King, deſirous to make prouiſion that the Lutheran ſect <note place="margin">The French King entreth into the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiall.</note> ſhould not more encreaſe in the Kingdome, vnderſtanding that ſome of the Counſellors of the Parliament were infected with it, in a Mercuriall (ſo they call the iudicature, inſtituted to examine and correct the actions of the Counſellors of Parliament, and Iudges of the King) held in <hi>Paris</hi> the 15. of Iune, where they were to treate of Religion, after the Congregation was aſſembled, entred in perſon. Hee ſaid hee had eſtabliſhed peace in the whole world, by the marriages of his ſiſter and daughter, that hee might prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inconueniences bred in his Kingdome about Religion, which ought to bee the principall care of Princes. Therefore vnderſtanding they were to treat of this ſubiect, hee exhorted them to handle Gods cauſe with ſinceritie. And hauing commaunded them to proſecute the things begun, <hi>Claude <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iole</hi> one of them, ſpake much againſt the manners of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the bad cuſtomes, growen to bee pernicious errours, which haue cauſed the new ſects. Therefore it was neceſſary to mitigate the ſeuere pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, vntill the differences of religion were remooued, and the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall diſcipline amended by authority of a Generall Councell, the onely remedie for theſe euils, as the Councels of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> haue iudged, commanding that one ſhould bee celebrated euery ten yeeres. His opinion was followed by <hi>Ludouicus Faber,</hi> and ſome others. <hi>Anne du Bourg</hi> did adde, that many villanies were comitted, condemned by the Lawes, for puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof, the rope and fire were not ſufficient; as frequent blaſphemies againſt God, periuries, adulteries, not onely ſecret, but euen cheriſhed with impudent licence; making himſelfe to be plainely vnderſtood, that hee ſpake not onely of the Grandies of the Court, but of the King himſelfe alſo; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that, while men liued thus diſſolutely, diuers torments were prepared againſt thoſe who were guilty of nothing, but of publiſhing to the world the vices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and deſiring an amendment of them. In oppoſition of all this, <hi>Egidius Magiſter,</hi> the prime Preſident ſpake againſt the new ſects, concluding that there was no other remedie, but that which was formerly vſed againſt the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> of whom <hi>Philippus Augustus</hi> put to death ſixe hundred in one day, and againſt the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who were choked in the caues, whither they retired to hide themſelues. When all the voyces were giuen, the King ſaid, he had now heard with his owne eares, that which
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:17208:217"/>
before was told him, that the contagion of the Kingdome doth hence ariſe, <note place="margin">1559 PIVS 4. FERDINAND. PHILIP 2. ELIZABETH. HENRY 2.

Cardinals, and conſulting with them about the reiection of the Ambaſſage of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of <hi>Paul</hi> not to acknowledge him for Emperour, the common opinion was, that he had receiued wrong. But after a long conſultation how to remedie this inconuenience, many things being propoſed and diſcuſſed, but no meanes found how to treat without danger of greater incounters, in caſe the <hi>Electors</hi> ſhould interpoſe (as it was impoſſible to forbid them) the common opinion was, that they were to auoide all negotiation, becauſe it would conclude with the diſhonour of the Pope, and that it was better not to expect any requeſt to be made from the Emperour. This was approued by the Pope, who thought it wiſedom to giue that, which he could neither <note place="margin">He approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of <hi>Charles,</hi> &amp; the ſucceſſion of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
               </note> keepe nor ſell. He therefore preſently called for <hi>Franciſcus della Torre,</hi> the Emperours Miniſter in <hi>Rome,</hi> and tolde him that he approued the reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Charles,</hi> A ſucceſſion of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to the Empire, promiſing to write vnto him with the vſual titles, and bad him ſend aduiſe hereof.</p>
            <p>After this, he thought ſeriouſly of the Councell, being aſſured hee ſhould
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:17208:219"/>
be importuned for it from diuers parts. Conferring with the Cardinall <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi> whom he truſted for his wiſedome and friendſhip, he much doubted, as himſelfe ſaid, whether the Councell were good for the Apoſtolique Sea, or not; and if not, whether it were better to denie it abſolutely, and freely oppoſe whoſoeuer ſhould deſire it, or to make ſhew he was willing, and to croſſe it with ſome impediments, beſides thoſe which the buſineſſe it ſelfe <note place="margin">And conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth about the Councel.</note> would bring: and if it were fit to celebrate it, whether it were better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect vntill he were requeſted, or to preuent and require it himſelfe He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to minde the cauſes why <hi>Paul</hi> the 3, did diſſolue it vnder colour of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and the hazards which <hi>Iulius</hi> did runne, if good fortune had not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted; that now there was no Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> to be feared, and that the weaker the Princes are, the BB. are the more bolde, who were the more to be looked vnto, becauſe they cannot aduance themſelues but vpon the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the Papacie. To oppoſe openly the demand of the Councell was ſcandalous, in regard of the glorious name thereof, and of the vaine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the world hath, that it muſt needs be profitable; as alſo becauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one is perſwaded, that the Councel is refuſed for feare of reformation; which maketh the refuſall a greater ſcandall. And if neceſſitie ſhal enforce to grant that which had bene abſolutely denied, it will be a totall loſſe of reputation, and incite the world to debaſe him who hath oppoſed. In theſe ambiguities the Pope was aſſured that the Councel could not be profitable for the Church, nor for the Kingdomes diuided, and muſt neceſſarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the Papal authoritie; yet he could not openly oppoſe it, becauſe the world was vncapable of this trueth. But he was vncertaine, whether, in caſe the Kings or Kingdomes did require it the coiunctures of the future affaires might be ſuch, as that the ſecret impediments might take effect. When hee had thought of all, he concluded to ſhew himſelfe ready, yea, deſirous, and to preuent the deſires of others, that he might conceale himſelfe the better in croſſing them, and haue more credit in repreſenting the contrary difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, referring to the ſuperiour cauſes that deliberation, to which humane iudgement could not reach. So much he reſolued of, and no more.</p>
            <p>The coronation was made at the Epiphany; and the eleauenth of the ſame moneth he held a frequent congregation of Cardinals, in which he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his minde at large, that hee would reforme the Court, and call a generall Councell, charging them all to conſider what things deſerued reformation, and of the place, time &amp; other preparations of the Synod, that it might not bring foorth the ſame fruit that it had done twice before. And afterwards he ſpake of this in his priuate diſcourſes with the Cardinals and Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, vpon all occaſions; yet did nothing which might manifeſt his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more plainely.</p>
            <p>Newes came to the Emperour at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna</hi> of what the Pope had intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Miniſter; who immediatly deputed an Ambaſſadour, and, before <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſendeth an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to <hi>Rome.</hi>

This was <hi>Scipio,</hi> Count of <hi>Arco,</hi> who came to <hi>Rome</hi> the tenth of February, and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:17208:220"/>
fell into a great difficulty in the very beginning. For the Emperour gaue him commiſſion to render to the Pope reuerence onely, and the Pope was reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute hee ſhould render him obedience, ſhewing that the. Ambaſſadours of other Emperors had done ſo to his predeceſſors, and ſaid plainly, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he would not admit him. The Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Pacceco</hi> aduiſed him not to tranſgreſſe his commiſſion, but the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals <note place="margin">Who, after ſome conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Pope, not reuerence onely.</note> 
               <hi>Morone</hi> &amp; <hi>Trent</hi> perſwaded the contrary; whoſe opinion he followed, becauſe the Emperour had giuen him charge to conſult with thoſe two Cardinals in all matters. After the ceremonie was ended in the Conſiſtery, with ſatisfaction of the Pope, the Ambaſſadour, begin to pray him in the firſt priuate audience, in <hi>Caeſars</hi> name, to call the Councel to compoſe the diſſenſions of <hi>Germany,</hi> was preuented by him, with the Ambaſſadors great contentment; who beleeuing that hee was to treat with the Pope, about an <note place="margin">And is well pleaſed that his Holineſſe beginneth to speake of the Councell.</note> vnpleaſing buſineſſe, was prepared to deliuer in ſugered termes, that it might be heard more willingly. The Pope told him, that the Cardinals, being in the Conclaue, conſulted how they might ſet the Councell on foote againe, in which conſultation himſelfe was a very principal partie; and now being Pope, was more confirmed in the ſame determination. Yet he would not proceede blindely, but ſo as that he might auoyd the difficulties, which happened before, and would bee ſure of the neceſſarie preparatories, that the deſired fruit might ſucceed. Hee ſayd the like to the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and wrote to his <hi>Nuncij</hi> to impart it to their Kings: hee ſpake of it alſo with the Ambaſſadours of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and of the Princes of <hi>Italie,</hi> which were in <hi>Rome.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Popes haue to hold a Colloquie.</note>
            </p>
            <p>After this the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> ſent one expreſly to deſire the Pope, that by his fauour, he might make a <hi>colloquie</hi> of religion, to inſtruct his people of the <hi>Vallies,</hi> who were generally alienated from the old religion. Theſe were a part of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who, 400, yeeres ſince, forſooke the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in regard of the perſecutions, fled into <hi>Polonia, Germany, Puglia, Prouence,</hi> and ſome of them into the <hi>Valleys</hi> of <hi>Mountſenis, Luſerna, Angronia, Peroſa, and S. Martin.</hi> Theſe hauing alwayes continued in their ſeparation, with certaine miniſters of their owne, whom they called Paſtors, when the doctrine of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was planted in <hi>Geneua,</hi> did preſently vnite themſelues with thoſe, as agreeing with them in points of doctrine, &amp; principall rites: and when <hi>Piemont</hi> was vnder the French-men, though they were forbid vpon paine of death to exerciſe their religion, yet by little and little, they made it publique, ſo that when Countrey was reſtored to the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> the exerciſe of it was almoſt free. The Duke reſolued to make them receiue the Catholike religion, ſo that many were burned, and put to death by other meanes, and more condemned to the Galleys, at the inſtigation of the <hi>Inquifitor, Thomaſo Iacomello,</hi> a <hi>Dominican Friar.</hi> This made them conſult whether it were lawfull to defend themſelues with Armes; wherein their miniſters did not agree. Some ſayd they might not oppoſe their Prince, though it were to defend their own liues, but might carry away their goods and reure into the mountaines. Others ſaid they might vſe force, in ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate a caſe as this, eſpecially it being not ſo much againſt the Prince, as againſt the Pope, who abuſed the autoritie of the Prince. Many of them
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:17208:220"/>
did follow the firſt opinion, and the others ſtood vpon their guard; ſo that the Duke perceiuing they had not rebellious thoughts, and that they might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be gained by inſtruction, receiued the counſell which was giuen him, to inſtitute a <hi>Colloquie</hi> to this end. But becauſe hee would not diſpleaſe the Pope, by proceeding without his knowledge, he gaue him an account here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and asked his conſent. The Pope beeing angry that, in <hi>Italy</hi> alſo, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">To inſtruct the people of his <hi>Valleys,</hi> whom before he had perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceted.</note> his noſe, his authority ſhould be queſtioned, anſwered that hee would conſent by no meanes; but, if thoſe people had neede of inſtruction, hee would ſend a Legate, with authority to abſolute them who would bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, accompanied with Diuines who might giue them inſtruction. But <note place="margin">But his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe refuſeth to grant it.</note> hee ſayd hee had little hope to conuert them, becauſe the heretikes are obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and whatſoeuer is done to exhort them to acknowledge their fault, they expound to bee a want of force to compell them. That it cannot bee remembred that any good was euer done by this moderation, but that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is taught, that the ſooner iuſtice is vſed, and force of Armes, when that other is not ſufficient, ſo much the better the ſucceſſe is. If hee would proceed thus, hee would ſend him aſſiſtance; but if he thought it not fit, all might bee deferred vntill a generall Councell, which he would ſuddenly call. <note place="margin">And therefore the Duke ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Armes againſt them.</note> The Duke did not like the ſending of a Legat, becauſe it would haue prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them more, and forced him to proceed according to the intereſts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, thinking it better to take Armes, which the Pope commended more, and promiſed aſſiſtance. Therefore there was warre in theſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alleys</hi> all this yeere, and part of the next, whereof we will ſpeake in the time when it ended.</p>
            <p>There was a great conſpiracie in many parts of <hi>France,</hi> into which many <note place="margin">A great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie in <hi>France,</hi> &amp; the cauſes of it.</note> were entred, and the maior part for cauſe of Religion, diſdaining to ſee poore people drawen euery day to the ſtake to bee burned, guilty of nothing but of zeale to worſhip GOD, and to ſaue their owne ſoules. To theſe were ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned others, who, thinking the Guiſards to be the cauſe of all the diſorders of the Kingdome, iudged it an heroike acte to deliuer it from oppreſſion, by taking the publike adminiſtration out of their hands. There were alſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious perſons, deſirous of change, who could not worke their will, but in the middeſt of troubles. Both theſe couered themſelues with the cloake of Religion, to gaine more followers: and the better to confirme their mindes, cauſed the Principall Lawyers of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and the moſt famous Proteſtant Diuines to publiſh in writing, that, without violating the Maieſtie of the King and dignity of the lawfull Magiſtrate, they might oppoſe with Armes, the violent domination of the houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who offended true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and lawfull iuſtice, and kept the King as it were in priſon. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators prepared a great multitude, who ſhould appeare before the King, without Armes, to demand that the ſeuerity of the iudgements might be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated, and liberty of conſcience granted, deſigning they ſhould bee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Gentlemen, who ſhould make ſupplication againſt the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Guiſards. The conſpiracie was diſcouered, and the Court reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from <hi>Blois,</hi> an open place fit for the execution of ſuch a purpoſe, vnto <note place="margin">The Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, and many of them executed and the reſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</note> 
               <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> a ſtrong fortreſſe. This troubled the Conſpiratours; who, while they were thinking of a new courſe, ſome of them, who tooke Armes, were beaten and ſlaine, and others taken and ſentenced to die; and to appeaſe the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:17208:221"/>
tumult, pardon was granted by the Kings Edict, dated the eighteenth of March, to all, who ſimply moued with zeale of Religion, had entred into the conſpiracie, ſo that they diſarmed within 24. houres. Afterwards the King, by his Edict, pardoned all the reformatiſts, vntill they returned to the Church. Hee forbade all aſſemblies for Religion, and committed to the Biſhops the hearing of the cauſes of hereſie. This diſpleaſed the Chancellor; though hee conſented, for feare the Spaniſh <hi>Inquiſition</hi> would bee brought in, as the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſards deſired.</p>
            <p>The humors mooued were not quieted by the puniſhment of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, and the pardons publiſhed, nor the hopes laid aſide, which they had conceiued, to haue libertie of religion, yea, greater tumults of the people were raiſed in <hi>Prouence, Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Poitou,</hi> whether the Preachers of <hi>Geneua</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants doe increaſe by meanes of the Preachers of <hi>Geneua.</hi>
               </note> were called, and came willingly: by whoſe Sermons the number of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants did increaſe. This generall and ſudden combination made the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of the Kingdome reſolute, that there was neede of an Eccleſiaſticall remedie, and that very quickly; and a Nationall Synode was propoſed by the whole Councell. The Cardinall of <hi>Armignac</hi> ſaid, that nothing was to be done without the Pope; that he alone was able to make prouiſion; that they ſhould write to <hi>Rome,</hi> and expect an anſwere. To which opinion ſome few Prelats did adhere. But the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> ſaid, that a ſudden remedy could not be expected from the Pope, becauſe he was farre diſtant, nor a fit one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was not informed of the particular neceſſity of the Kingdome, nor a charitable one, becauſe he was buſied in making his Nephewes great; that GOD had giuen to all kingdomes, all things neceſſary to gouerne them; that <hi>France</hi> had Prelats of its owne to regulate the cauſes of religion, who better know the wants of the kingdome; that it would bee a great abſurditie to ſee <hi>Paris</hi> burne, hauing the riuers of <hi>Some</hi> and <hi>Marne</hi> full of water, and to beleeue that water muſt be brought from <hi>Tiber,</hi> to quench the fire. The reſolution <note place="margin">A Nationall Synod is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> of the Councell was, that, there beeing neede of a ſtrong and ſudden remedy, the Prelates of the Kingdome ſhould aſſemble, to finde a way to hinder the courſe of theſe great miſchiefes: and the eleuenth of Aprill the Synod was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, for the tenth of September.</p>
            <p>But that the Pope might not take it in ill part, a Curriet was diſpatched to <hi>Rome,</hi> to giue him an account of the reſolution, and to enforme him of the neceſſity of that remedy, and to pray him not to take it amiſſe. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador repreſented to his Holineſſe the infection of the kingdome, and the dangers, and the hope which the King had of ſome good remedy by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Conuocation of the Prelats, without which he ſaw no meanes to make an effectuall pouiſion. Therefore hee was forced not to deferre longer, nor to expect remedies from places romote, which were vncertaine, and long in comming, and to vſe that which was in his owne power: and he added that no conſtitution of that Synod ſhould bee of force before it were confirmed by his Holineſſe. The Pope, on the contrary, did grieuouſly complaine, that the King had pardoned the errours committed againſt religion, euen of <note place="margin">The Pope blameth the French King for pardoning here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

be ſo many tumults in that kingdome, where the Sacred Canons are diſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed and the Popes authority vſurped. He ſaid that the aſſembling of the Prelats would doe no good, yea, would cauſe a greater diuiſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he had propoſed a generall Councel which was the onely remedy that the cauſe why it was not eſſembled already proceeded from them who would not haue it, that hee was reſolued to celebrate it, though it were deſired by none, but <note place="margin">And will not approue the Nationall Synod.</note> would not by any meanes conſent to the aſſembly of the Prelates, either in <hi>France</hi> or elſewhere, that this was neuer tolerated by the Apoſtolique Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if euery Prince ſhould celebrate Councels of himſelfe, a confuſion and ſeparation of the Church muſt needes follow.

            <p>Hee ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> with inſtruction, to ſhew him that a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall <note place="margin">But ſendeth a <hi>Nuncio</hi> into <hi>Spaine</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade it.</note> Councell of that Kingdome, would bee a kinde of Schiſme from the vniuerſall Church, giue a bad example to other nations, and make his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates proud, aſſuming greater authoritie, which diminution of his owne; that it is generally knowen how earneſtly they deſire the reſtitution of the <hi>Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique,</hi> which they would firſt of all bring in, by which meanes the King would loſe his whole collation of the regalities, and the preſentation of the Biſhoprickes and Abbies: whence it would follow that the Prelats, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the power of the King, would refuſe to obey him. And yet, with all theſe inconueniences, the euils which do now preſſe him, would not be prouided againſt. For the heretikes doe profeſſe already that they eſteeme not the Prelates, ſo that whatſoeuer they ſhould doe would bee oppoſed by the Proteſtant Miniſters, if for no other cauſe, becauſe it was done by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the true remedie was to make the Prelates, and other Curates reſide and keepe their flockes, oppoſing the furie of the woolues, and to proceed in iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt thoſe who are iudged to bee heretiques, by the iudges of faith, and where it cannot bee done in regard of the multitude, to vſe force of armes to compell all to the performance of their duetie; before the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth increaſe, that all theſe things beeing done now, all differences might bee compleatly endded, by the celebration of the generall Councell, which hee would immediatly intimate, that, if the King would reſolue to reduce the contumacious to obedience, before they did more increaſe in number and ſtrength, hee promiſed to aſſiſt him with all his power, and to labour that the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and Princes of <hi>Italie</hi> ſhould doe the like.

The Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to the propoſition of the warre of <hi>Geneua,</hi> promiſing to employ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholly in it, ſo that thoſe two Kings would bee content to aſſiſt him, and that the warre were to bee made by him and for him. For that Citie belonging to his Dominion, it was not iuſt, in caſe it were wonne, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould poſſeſſe it but himſelfe. Therefore if his Holineſſe would come to the effect, it was neceſſary to make a league with plaine capitulations, leſt ſome great inconuenience might ariſe, if either the Kings ſhould not agree, or himſelfe ſhould bee abandoned, after he had prouoked the <hi>Suiſſes</hi> againſt him, who would vndoubtedly defend the Citie.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Geneua,</hi> the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> conſidered, that <hi>France</hi> would not permit it ſhould bee in the hands of any but French-men, which was not good for his ſeruice, in regard of the vieinity of the <hi>Franche Countie.</hi> Therefore hee anſwered that hee thought it not a fit time to make attempt. But for the Nationall Councell of <hi>France,</hi> he was perſwaded it would bee a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous example to his States. Therefore hee diſpatched away <hi>Antonio di To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi> Prior of <hi>Lions,</hi> to ſignifie to the French King, that the celebration of that Councell would bee very hurtfull, in regard of the diuiſion which might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, the kingdome being infected. Hee prayed him not to goe on heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> French King from the Nationall Synode.</note> and ſayd, that nothing mooued him to make this requeſt, but onely his loue to him, and his zeale to the glory of God. Hee left to his conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beſides the contentions which it might cauſe within his kingdome, the pernicious example which other Prouinces would take, and the preiudice it would bring to the Generall Councell, which was to bee held, and was the onely remedy for all the euils and diuiſions of Chriſtendome; that it would ſhew there was not ſo good intelligence betweene the Emperour and them as ſhould bee, and would make the Proteſtants waxe proud, in preiudice of the publique cauſe. Hee added, that hee wanted not force to repreſſe the inſolencies of his Subiects, and, if hee would make vſe of the forces of him the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hee would very willingly employ them in this caſe, and his owne perſon alſo, if there were neede, that his Subiects might not boaſt they had brought him to any indignitie: whereof he was to conſider much now, in this beginning of his reigne. Hee gaue commiſſion alſo to his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, that, if hee could not obtaine this, hee ſhould, for the ſame and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſons, negotiate a ſuſpenſion of it, for as long a time as he could, and ſhould treate with the Cardinall of <hi>Lorayne,</hi> who, as hee vnderſtood, had a great hand in this Councell, that, as a Prince of the Church, and as hauing a great part in the gouernement of that Kingdome, hee was bound to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dammage which might redound to it, and all Chriſtendome. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo the ſame requeſt to be made to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the Conſtable, the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:17208:222"/>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>argas</hi> his Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> of whatſoeuer hee did. Likewiſe hee gaue the Pope aduice of the earneſt requeſt he had made by one expreſly ſent, and of the need that King had of aſſiſtance. To this he added the neceſſitie in which himſelfe was, the Turkes hauing taken from him the yeere before, twenty Gallies, twenty fiue <note place="margin">And deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the Pope a Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die from the Eccleſiaſtikes.</note> round Ships, and the fortreſſe of <hi>Gerbe;</hi> which forced him to increaſe his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He therefore requeſted his Holineſſe, to grant him a large Subſidy of the Churches, and Benefices of his Kingdomes.</p>

               </note> it would make the <hi>Hugonots</hi> (ſo the Reformatiſts are called) ſuſpicious, and vnite themſelues. Beſides, none going to that warre but the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, the Kingdome would bee left open to the oppoſites. And to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> protectors of that Citie, ſeemed not good, in regard of the ſeruice they might doe that Crowne. Therefore they anſwered the <hi>Nuncio</hi> onely thus, that, while ſo great confuſion did afflict the Kingdome within, it was impoſſible to apply themſelues to matters abroad. But, for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall <note place="margin">The French Kings anſwer concerning the Nationall Synode.</note> Councell, the ſame anſwere was giuen to <hi>Toledo</hi> and the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> that the King was reſolued to keepe himſelfe and the kingdome in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique vnion; that hee would make a Nationall Councell to ſeparate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but to vnite to the Church thoſe that went aſtray; that a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell would more pleaſe, and, in likelyhood, be more profitable, if his vrgent occaſions would ſuffer him to expect the time, which muſt needes be very long; that the Nationall Councell, which hee deſireth, ſhall depend on the Apoſtolique Sea, and the Pope, which ſhall ceaſe when the Generall ſhall be aſſembled, and ſhall incorporate with it. And that his deedes may anſwere to his words, hee deſired the Pope to ſend a Legate into <hi>France,</hi> with power to aſſemble the Biſhops of the Kingdome, and to ſettle the affaires of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>The Pope caſt foorth the Propoſition to make warre againſt <hi>Geneua,</hi> not ſo much for the hatred hee bare to that Citie, as the Seminary of the Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glian Preachers in <hi>France,</hi> or for feare of ſome innouation in <hi>Italy,</hi> as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the treatie of the Generall Councell. For if the warre had beene kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, it would haue laſted a yeere at the leaſt, and in the meane while, the Councell would haue beene forgotten, or a good forme would haue beene found for it. But now, ſeeing that his propoſition did not take effect, and that the French did ſtill perſeuere in their reſolution for a nationall Synode, hee thought it neceſſary not to deferre his determination for the generall, and to ſtop the French-men with this, and with ſome grant of what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. Hee conferred hereof with the Cardinals which were moſt intimate <note place="margin">Maketh the Pope haſten the General Councell.</note> with him, and particularly about the place, which ſeemed of moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe, in concluſion, the Councell doth produce effect according to the minde of him that is ſtrongeſt in the place where it is celebrated. Hee would faine haue propoſed <hi>Bolonia,</hi> or ſome other of his owne Cities, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to goe thither in perſon, but ſaw it would bee ill conſtrued by the world. He was reſolued not to accept of any Citie beyond the Mountains, no not to heare any propoſition of it. The Cardinall <hi>Pacceco</hi> propoſed <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:17208:223"/>
and he condeſcended, ſo that he might haue the Caſtle in his hands, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of the Councell; which was to referre himſelfe to an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition. He thought alſo vpon ſome of the Venetian Cities, but the Republique excuſed it ſelfe, leſt they ſhould make the Turkes ſuſpicious, of whoſe forces they were then afraid. When hee had conſidered all, he found no fitter place then <hi>Trent.</hi> For the Councell hauing been held there twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, euery one had experience of what was good, and what bad in that place, <note place="margin">Who, after conſultation, thinketh <hi>Trent</hi> the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt place for the aſſembly.</note> and therefore would more eaſily conſent to goe thither then elſewhere. And there was alſo ſome appearance of reaſon for it, becauſe the Councell, celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Iulius,</hi> was not finiſhed, but ſuſpended. Hee thought to ſatisfie the French men, by ſending Cardinall <hi>Tornon</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> not in qualitie of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, but with power, when he was there and ſaw there neede, to aſſemble <note place="margin">And ſendeth Card. <hi>Tornon</hi> into <hi>France</hi> to hinder a Nationall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod there.</note> ſome of the Prelats of the Kingdome, ſuch as the King and himſelfe thought fit, but not all, that there might be no appearance of a Councell, and to treate with theſe, but to reſolue of nothing.</p>
            <p>There were alſo two other accidents of no leſſe conſideration, which thruſt the Pope forward to ſpeake more plainely of a Councell; one farre off, but imported the loſſe of a Kingdome; the other concerned one perſon onely, but was of great conſequence. The Nobilitie of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who had a <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Scotland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolteth from the Pope.</note> long time made warre to chaſe the French men out of the Kingdome, and to take the gouernment out the handes of the Queene Regent, and had euer encountred many difficulties, in regard of the great ſuccours, ſent her by her ſonne in law the French King, to maintaine the kingdome for his wife; finally that they might quite free themſelues, they reſolued to ioyne with the Engliſh, and incite the people againſt the Regent. To this end they gaue way to libertie of religion, to which the people was inclined. By this meanes they brought the Frenchmen into great ſtraits, and the old religion was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle eſteemed; for which the Pope was blamed, becauſe the world thought, that, if the Councell had beene begunne, all popular commotions would haue beene ſtopped. The other accident was, that the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> had, a long time, held intelligence with the Proteſtant Electors, and Princes of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Maximilian</hi> is, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, thought to be a Proteſtant.</note> 
               <hi>Germanie,</hi> and was formerly ſuſpected for it by <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, ſo that hee could not refraine to obiect to the Emperour, in priuate diſcourſe which hee had with <hi>Martin Guſman</hi> his Ambaſſadour, that his ſonne was a fauourer of hereſie. The ſame ſuſpicion continuing in the Court after the death of <hi>Paul,</hi> the Pope cauſed the Count of <hi>Arco</hi> to tell him, that if he would not liue as a Catholique, hee would not confirme him King of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> yea, would depriue him of all Dominion. Notwithſtanding this, aduice came afterwards to <hi>Rome,</hi> that hee entertained a Preacher, and heard him often, who had brought in the vſe of the <hi>Cup</hi> in diuers places, but not in the Citie; and the King himſelfe ſayd, hee could not receiue it otherwiſe: which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he put not in practiſe, yet thoſe words gaue the Pope great ſuſpicion, eſpecially becauſe, almoſt in all places of <hi>Germanie,</hi> the Communion of <note place="margin">Which two accidents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Pope to call the Councell quickly.</note> the Chalice was vſed by all that would, and none hindered the Prieſts to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it. For all theſe former reſpects the Pope was reſolute to make this great iumpe.</p>
            <p>The third of Iune he called the Ambaſſadours of the Emperour, of <hi>Spaine,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:17208:223"/>
Portugal Polonia, Venice</hi> and <hi>Florence;</hi> who appearing all before his Holineſſe, except the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Polonia,</hi> that was ſicke, hee complained firſt, that hee could not call the French Ambaſſadour for feare of ſome queſtion of precedencie, which was a cauſe to hinder the publique benefit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting on the common affaires of Chriſtendome: but thoſe two Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing couſins, it was neceſſary they ſhould reſolue to accommodate the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <note place="margin">Wherein hee declareth his purpoſe to all the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors reſiding with him.</note> for the good of the Chriſtian Common-wealth, and eſpecially of their owne Kingdomes. Then hee ſaid, that, the cauſe why hee had called them, was the celebration of the Councell, which hee was reſolued to bring to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, remoouing all difficulties, which Princes, for their owne ends, might ſet on foote: that the place ſhould be <hi>Trent,</hi> which hauing pleaſed twice, could now be denied by none, in regard it was not a new place, and the Councell celebrated there onely ſuſpended. Therefore taking away the ſuſpenſion, the Councell is open, as before; and many good Conſtitutions hauing been made there, it would not be fit to call them in queſtion, by making ſhew of calling a new Councell. He added that it was neceſſary to doe it quickly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe things grew worſe euery day as appeared in <hi>France,</hi> where they treated of a Nationall Councell; which hee neither would nor could endure, becauſe <hi>Germanie,</hi> and euery Prouince would doe the like; that hee would giue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his <hi>Nuncij</hi> with the Emperour, Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> to treate hereof with their Maieſties, and did now intimate the ſame to all them, that they might ſend their Princes word of it. For although he could both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue and execute of him ſelfe, yet hee thought fit to doe it with their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they might put him in minde of ſome things for the common be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and reformation of the Church, and ſend Ambaſſadours to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and fauour it by treating with the Proteſtants. Hee added, that hee did beleeue that ſome of the Princes of <hi>Germanie</hi> would goe thither in perſon, and that he was ſure the Marquiſſe of <hi>Brandeburg</hi> would.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vargas</hi> made a long anſwere, relating what had been done in former Councels. He diſcourſed of the manner of celebrating Councels, and then deſcended to the place, and ſpake of what was done in <hi>Trent,</hi> where himſelfe was preſent. He diſtinguiſhed Generall Councels from Nationall, much condemning that which was intimated in <hi>France.</hi> The Ambaſſadour of <hi>Portugall</hi> commended the Popes purpoſe, and promiſed the obedience of his Maſter. The <hi>Venetian</hi> ſayd, that, in times paſt, neuer any better remedie was found then Councels, and thanked GOD for inſpiring his Holineſſe to doe ſo pious a worke, which was for the preſeruation of Religion, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Princes, who could not hold their States in peace in change of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Florentine</hi> Ambaſſadour ſpake in the ſame manner, offering all aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Duke. The Pope wrote to his <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>Germany, France,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">But alwyes vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may croſſe it.</note> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> in conformity of that which hee ſpake to the Ambaſſadours, Yet hee neuer talked of the Councell, but hee caſt foorth ſome ſeed of a contrary herbe, which might hinder the birth of it, or choke it afterwards, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that, when the affaires of the world did ſtand ſo, that the life of it might doe him ſeruice, hee could roote out that which hee had ſowed vpon it. Hee told the ſame Ambaſſadours apart, ſome more plainely, ſome in ieſt, that, to call the Councel with profit, it was neceſſary to thinke more of the end, then
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:17208:224"/>
of the beginning, and of the execution, then of the Conuocation, proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: that the Conuocation belonged to him alone, the proſecution to him and the Prelats, the execution to the Princes: and therefore that it was meet, that, firſt of all, they ſhould binde themſelues to it, and make a league, and elect a generall Captaine, to goe againſt the diſobedient, to execute the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Councell, conſidering that, without this, it would be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and diſhonourable to the Apoſtolike Sea, and to thoſe Princes who had ſent Ambaſſadours, and afforded fauour and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The Pope did not receiue a conformable anſwere from his <hi>Nuncij.</hi> The <note place="margin">The French King doth not thinke <hi>Trent</hi> a fit place for the Councell.</note> King of <hi>Spaine</hi> commended the Councell, approoued the place of <hi>Trent,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſend his Prelates to it, and to fauour it by all other meanes; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it was not fit to doe any thing without the good will of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and French King. The anſwere of this King was, that hee approoued the celebration of the Councell, but not the place of <hi>Trent,</hi> alleadging that his Prelates could not goe thither, and propoſing for places more fit, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, Triers, Spire, Wormes,</hi> or <hi>Aganoa.</hi> Hee intimated alſo, that they ought not to make a continuation of the things begun in <hi>Trent,</hi> but to abandon <note place="margin">Nor that the doctrines, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcuſſed there, ſhould be maintained without reex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination</note> them quite, and make a whole new Councell. This anſwere troubled the Pope, who thought it did not proceede from the Kings owne motion, but from the <hi>Hugonots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Emperour ſent a long writing, in which hee ſayd, hee could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe nothing for the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> before hee knew their opinion; which he could not doe without a Diet: which if hee would call, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary not to name the Councell, becauſe the Princes would not goe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but pretending another cauſe to call it, hee might afterwards ſpeake <note place="margin">Of whoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion the Emperour is.</note> of it by occaſion. Hee added, that, for his patrimoniall States, hee had no hope to bring them to the Synode, without graunting them the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Cuppe, and marriage of Prieſts, and without a good refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation were made; but aboue all, that no mention ought to bee made of a continuation of the things begun in <hi>Trent.</hi> For the Lutheranes would neuer conſent otherwiſe, yea, the very name of <hi>Trent</hi> would make them refuſe. And he propoſed <hi>Constance</hi> or <hi>Ratisbon.</hi> The Pope ſaw that the propoſition of a Diet did require the time of a yeere, and perhaps of two, and was glad of it, but was ſory that the occurrences of <hi>France</hi> required haſte. He told euery one, to ſhew his forwardneſſe, that he cared not for one place more then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and would take <hi>Spire, Collen,</hi> or any other Citie which pleaſed the Emperour, ſo that the Biſhops might come and goe in ſafetie, it not being conuenient to ſecure thoſe who haue no voyce in the Councell, and leaue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without ſecuritie who certainely haue. But it was not fit to ſpeake of reuoking what was done in <hi>Trent,</hi> ſaying he would ſpend his blood in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, it beeing a matter of faith. Concerning that which is of humane conſtitution, as the Communion of the Cup, and marriage of Prieſtes, theſe prohibitions beeing made for a good end, as hee would not take them away of himſelfe, which he had power to doe, ſo he would referre all to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, howſoeuer hee ſaw they would neuer forſake their opinion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was granted them. Hee complained of the Emperours weakeneſſe, who feared his owne ſonne no leſſe then others, and then deſired the Prelates
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:17208:224"/>
ſhould be ſent into <hi>Germanie;</hi> where hee declared he had not power to ſecure them, that he would goe to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſo that hee might haue ſecuritie, which could not be expected from the Emperour, that the <hi>Germans</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in Heretiques, and the King of the <hi>Romanes</hi> more potent then his father; in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>egarded not one place more then another, ſo that it were in <hi>Italy,</hi> which onely is ſecure for the Catholiques.</p>
            <p>Therefore he anſwered the French King, and the Emperour, in generall <note place="margin">The Popes anſwere to them both.</note> terme, that hee was content with any ſecure place, ſaying that the ſecuritie of the Councel hath alwayes beene eſteemed neceſſary, and was now as much as euer, without making particular oppoſition againſt the places na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by them. But, in his anſwere to the Catholique King, hee commended his good mind, and confirmed him in his purpoſe; and, for the ſubſidie he deſired hee interpoſed diuers difficulties, as well to maintaine the profits of the Church, as not to offend him, and make him his oppoſite, in the time of the Councell.</p>
            <p>The affaires of the Catholiques waxed euery day more difficult. For the <note place="margin">The Low-countrey men wax peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory againſt their King.</note> Hugonots in <hi>France</hi> grew ſtronger, and in <hi>Scotland</hi> liberty of Religion was granted to all by publique decree, and in <hi>Flanders</hi> the humors were prepared to ſtirre, vpon the firſt occaſion; which the King did appeaſe by proceeding ſlowly graunting them what they would, though to his owne loſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie. Firſt, they refuſed to contribute to the King before the Spaniſh ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were remooued out of the Countrey; when theſe were diſmiſſed, they would pay to none but to the people of their owne Countrey, and onely for the guard of ſtrong places, and thoſe not to depend of the Kings Miniſters. The King endured all, knowing that euery little diſtaſte would make them ſet on foote the pretence of Religion, and expected vntill the heat were extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; which he did the rather, becauſe it was diſcouered that the ſeedes of the new opinions in <hi>Spaine</hi> were not dead, but onely couered for feare, and that in <hi>Sauoy</hi> there were more heretiques beſides the old <hi>Waldenſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> was grieued moſt of all, that the Pope hauing, by his nephew <hi>Marcus Altemps,</hi> who afterwards was Cardinall, perſwaded the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to be a good Catholique, with many promiſes of honours and profits, intimating the ſucceſſion of the Empire, which he would hardly obtaine in caſe he ſhould doe otherwiſe, was anſwered by the King, that hee <note place="margin">The anſwere of <hi>Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes nephew, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Religion.</note> thanked his Holineſſe, but that his ſoules health was more deare to him, then all the things of the world, which anſwere they ſayd in <hi>Rome,</hi> was a Lutheran forme of ſpeach, and ſignified an alienation from the obedience of that Sea, and they began to diſcourſe what would happen after the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours death. While theſe accidents troubled the Popes minde, newes was <note place="margin">The Popes Subiects of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uignion</hi> rebel againſt him.</note> brought him, that the Hugonots his Subiects in the territory of <hi>Auignion</hi> were aſſembled, and diſputed whether they might take Armes againſt the Pope their temporall Lord, and reſolued they might, becauſe his ſucceſſion was not lawful, as well becauſe that Countrey was not iuſtly taken from <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondus,</hi> Count of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> as alſo for that the Eccleſiaſtiques cannot, by the commandement of Chriſt, poſſeſſe any temporal Dominion: and reſoluing to rebel, by the means of <hi>Alexander Guilotimus,</hi> a lawyer, put themſelues vnder the protection of <hi>Charles de Montbrun,</hi> who was in Armes for Religion, and was
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:17208:225"/>
much followed in <hi>Dolphinie. Charles,</hi> entring the territory with three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foote, made himſelfe Lord of the whole Countrey, with much ioy of the inhabitants. <hi>Iames Maria,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iuiers,</hi> Vice-Legat of <hi>Auignion,</hi> made oppoſition, and very hardly kept the Citie. The Pope was much afflicted herewith, not ſo much for the loſſe of the Countrey, as for the cauſe, which, being taken for an example, would touch the very root of the Papacie. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſent Cardinall <hi>Farne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e,</hi> who was Legat, to defend the Citie. But the danger was moderated, becauſe Cardinall <hi>Tornon</hi> (whoſe Neede <hi>Charles</hi> had <note place="margin">But all danger was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by means of Cardinall <hi>Tornon.</hi>
               </note> married) who was then not farre from that place, as hee was going to the Court, made him deſiſt, and goe to <hi>Geneua,</hi> by promiſing reſtitution of his goods, confiſcated for rebellion, and to bee recalled ſhortly, with liberty of conſcience, if he would goe out of <hi>France.</hi> So the Popes territory, depriued of that protection, did remaine in ſubiection, but full of ſuſpicions, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to embrace euery nouitie.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants ſtill increaſing in <hi>France,</hi> and which was of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the diſſentions and ſuſpicions betweene the Grandies, the 21. of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 1560. the King called a very great aſſembly at <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi> in which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">1560.

               </note> briefly exhorted, to ſet downe what was fit for his ſeruice, the neceſſities of the Kingdome were declared by the Chancellour, which hee compared to a man ſicke of an vnknowen diſeaſe. Afterwards <hi>Iaſper Colignie</hi> gaue the King ſome petitions, which he ſaid were deliuered to him, by a multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when he was in <hi>Normandy,</hi> vnto whom hee could not denie this fauour, to preſent them to his Maieſtie. The ſumme of them was; that the faithfull Chriſtians, diſperſed throughout the whole Kingdome, did pray his Maieſty to looke on them with a fauourable eye; that they deſired nothing but a moderation of the cruell puniſhments, vntill their cauſe were heard; and that they might make publique profeſſion of their Religion, to auoid ſuſpicion by priuate aſſemblies. Then <hi>Iohn Monluc,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> hauing declared the <note place="margin">In which the opinions were diuers.</note> infirmities of the Kingdome, and commended the chaſtiſing of the fediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſayd that the cauſe of the euill remained, yea ſtill grew worſe, ſo long as religion might bee taken for a pretence; againſt which, prouiſion had not beene formerly made, becauſe the Popes had no other ayme, but to holde the Princes in warre; and the Princes, thinking to ſuppreſſe the euill with puniſhments, haue not attained the wiſhed end, nor the Magiſtrates and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops iuſtly performed their duetie. The principall remedie was to flie vnto GOD, to aſſemble godly men out of the whole Kingdome, to finde a way to roote out the vices of the Clergie, to forbid infamous and immodeſt ſongs, and in ſtead of them to command the ſinging of Pſalmes, and holy hymnes, in the vulgar tongue; and if the common interpretation which goeth about be not good, to take away the errours, ſuffering that which is good to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by all. Another remedie was, the Generall Councell, alwayes vſed to compoſe ſuch differences; that hee could not ſee how the Popes conſcience could be quiet one moment, in regard ſo many ſoules did periſh euery day; ſaying, that if a Generall Councell could not bee obtained, they were to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a Nationall, by the example of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boneere;</hi> that they did grieuouſly erre who troubled the publique quiet with armes, vpon pretence of Religion, a thing alwayes abhorred by antiquitie;
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:17208:225"/>
that their errour was as great, who condemned to death thoſe that adhered <note place="margin">1560 PIVS 4. FERDINAND. ELTZABETH.

            <p>
               <hi>Charles Marillac</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſpake in the ſame manner; commending the Generall Councell, but adding, that it might ſooner bee deſired then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, conſidering the difficulties which doe vſually ariſe in ſuch a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherein <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. hauing taken great paines, hath euer been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by the Popes. Beſides, the diſeaſe of <hi>France</hi> is ſo ſharpe, that there is no time to call a Phyſician from farre. Therefore they were to call a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Councell, as had been vſed from the time of <hi>Clodoue</hi> vntill <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and afterwards vntill <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth, ſometimes of the whole kingdome, and ſometimes of part: that now, the diſeaſe being vrgent, they were to expect no longer, nor to holde any eſteeme of the impediments which the Pope did interpoſe; in the meane while that the Prelates ought to reſide, and that the Italians, who haue a third part of the Benefices, were not to be ſuffered to enioy the fruits in their abſence; to take away all Simonie, and ordaine, as was done in the <hi>Anciran</hi> Councell, that almes ſhould not bee giuen in times of adminiſtring the Sacraments; that the Cardinals and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, deputed by <hi>Paul</hi> the third, gaue the ſame counſell, that <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth thought it neceſſary, though afterwards hee gaue himſelfe to luxury and war, that if this were not done, there was danger to ſee the prophecie of <hi>Bernard</hi> verified, <hi>That</hi> CHRIST <hi>would deſcend from heauen to whippe the Prieſts out of the Temple, as hee had the Merchants.</hi> Then hee ſpake of the remedies for the other maladies of the Kingdome. <hi>Colignl,</hi> when it was his turne to ſpeake, ſaid, that requiring thoſe who gaue him the petitions to ſubſcribe them, hee was anſwered, that 5000. men would ſubſcribe, if there were occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> concerning the point of Religion, ſaid, hee referred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the iudgement of learned men, but proteſted that no Councell ſhould haue ſo great authority with him, as to make him decline one iote from the old beliefe. The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> hauing ſpoken of other particulars, deſcending to that of Religion, ſayd, that the petitions preſented were moſt proud, and that to grant the Orators publique exerciſe, were to approoue their doctrine; that it was a cleere caſe, that the greater part vſed Religion for a pretence; and therefore his opinion was, they ſhould bee proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt with more ſeueritie, mitigating the puniſhment of thoſe who aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without Armes, onely for Religion, inſtructing and admoniſhing them; and to this purpoſe to cauſe the Prelates to reſide, hoping that by theſe reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, all will bee prouided for, without either Generall or Nationall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. The voyces beeing not vniforme, a Decree was made, the 27. of that moneth, that there ſhould bee an aſſembly of the States at <hi>Meaux,</hi> the tenth of December, and, if the Generall Councell ſhall not be called ſuddenly, as the Pope hath made ſhew, the Biſhops ſhall aſſemble the 13. of Ianuary to treat <note place="margin">The Decree of this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</note> of celebrating a Nationall: in the meane while the puniſhments for cauſe of Religion were ſuſpended, except againſt thoſe who tooke Armes.</p>
            <p>The Pope, enformed of the reſolution of the aſſembly of <hi>Fountainbleau,</hi>
               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:17208:226"/>
wrote to Cardinall <hi>Tornon</hi> to hinder the meeting of the Biſhops, and, if hee could not returne to <hi>Rome.</hi> And the three and twentieth of September hee called the Ambaſſadours, and told them the neceſeitie of the ſudden ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of a generall Councell, in regard of the determination of the Frenchmen, to call a Nationall; which though he had giuen order to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Tornon</hi> to hinder, yet hee did not hope it could be done. But hee ſaw <note place="margin">Cauſeth the Pope to make ſhew that hee is reſolued to call the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel ſuddenly.</note> a neceſſitie to celebrate the generall Councell, that it might not bee ſayd that the Nationals were called, for want of it. Therefore that hee muſt needes open the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> taking away the ſuſpenſion; that the place was moſt fit, beeing betweene <hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> though others propoſe <hi>Spire, Triers,</hi> and other places, which hee would accept if they were ſecure; beeing readie to goe to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> if hee might with ſafetie; that one could not truſt thoſe who want faith; that no Catholike could bee ſecure in thoſe places, no not the Emperour himſelfe; that, if they refuſe <hi>Trent,</hi> they may finde places in the Dukedome of <hi>Milan,</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> in the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> or <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> Concerning the reuocation of the things already decided, it was not to bee mentioned, that hee would neither reuoke nor confirme them, but referre all to the Councell, which, with the aſſiſtance of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, will determine whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe God. Hee did much rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vpon the Nationall Councell of <hi>France,</hi> ſaving that <hi>Germanie</hi> would follow the example, and that ſome ſtirres would bee raiſed in <hi>Italie,</hi> if order were not taken; that they would ſubmit the Papacie to the Councell, and whatſoeuer belongeth to it. But his reſolution was this: <hi>Pro fide &amp; religione volumus mori:</hi> Deſiring the Ambaſſadours to ſpeake their opinion, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Ambaſſadour ſayd, it was better to take time, in regard the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours affaires would not permit him to conſent. The Pope ſeeming to bee angry, the Ambaſſadour added, that it was good firſt to winne the mindes of the Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi> The Pope anſwered more angerly, that there <note place="margin">Wherein he is contradicted by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rours Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour onely.</note> was now no time to doe it; and the Ambaſſadour replying, that he feared that by this meanes the heretiques would bee incited againſt <hi>Italy,</hi> the Pope ſaid aloud, that GOD would not abandon his owne cauſe, and that he ſhould bee aſſiſted by the Catholique Princes, with men and money, for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The Spaniſh Ambaſſadour commended the Popes purpoſe, and ſaid that his King would not faile to fauour him, and that to this end hee had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſent <hi>Antonio di Toledo</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> The Ambaſſadours of <hi>Portugall, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and others offered the fauour and aſſiſtance of their Princes, and in the ende, the Pope gaue them order to ſignifie his intention, and ſo diſmiſſed them.</p>
            <p>Afterwards hee receiued anſwere from Cardinall <hi>Tornon,</hi> that, hauing tried all meanes, hee was not able to remooue the King, nor any of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, nor could hope for any better ſucceſſe hereafter, yea, that hee ſaw all things to waxe worſe. The King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hauing ſent to the Pope the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall anſwere giuen to <hi>Toledo,</hi> wrote withall, that the French King excuſed himſelfe, that, without a Nationall Councell, hee could not remedie the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of his kingdome, and that it was no maruell, if, to withſtand inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, Princes doe that alone, which they ſhould doe together with the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:17208:226"/>
Pope. This letter troubled his Holineſſe thinking hee did inferre that hee might doe the ſame alſo himſelfe in <hi>Flanders.</hi> It was afterwards diſcouered that the Popes purpoſe was, if hee could not abſolutely auoyd the Councell, to deferre it at the leaſt, vntill he had ſet in order his domeſticall affaires. For, being to hold a Synod, it was neceſſary to giue a good example in the meane ſpace, and ſpend exceſſiuely in maintaining poore Prelats, and officers, and <note place="margin">The Popes ſecret purpoſe was to auoid, or deſerre the Councell.</note> other things, neceſſary for the Synode, which would conſume all the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes; and the buſineſſe it ſelfe alſo would take vp all his time, ſo that hee could not take care of his houſe. But hee reſolued, though againſt his will, not to deferre the Conuocation any longer. Whereupon the twentieth of <note place="margin">But maketh a contrary reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution againſt his will.</note> October hee held a Congregation of Cardinals, in which hee gaue them an account of the anſwere of the French King to <hi>Toledo,</hi> of the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> his letter to him, and of the negotiation of the Cardinall <hi>Tornon;</hi> adding a new aduertiſement ſent him out of <hi>France,</hi> that although the generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell were opened, they would not goe thither, if the Proteſtants did not conſent to receiue it. Theſe things put them in a great confuſion, and all feared, that though the generall Councell ſhould proceede, yet <hi>France</hi> would <note place="margin">And is much troubled with. the occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Trance.</hi>
               </note> make the Nationall, whence, by conſequence, an alienation from the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Apoſtolique Sea would ariſe, and an example to the reſidue of Chriſtendome to doe the like, either with, or without the conſent of their Princes.</p>
            <p>Some thought much of the Proteſtation made to the Cardinall of <hi>Trent,</hi> that hee ſhould not bee too liberall in offering that Citie, but remember that the Emperour is Lord of it, without whoſe conſent hee neither can, nor ought to diſpoſe of it in ſuch a buſineſſe; who had declared himſelfe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, that, by all meanes hee would firſt make a Diet. They were alſo much troubled with that which <hi>D. Antenio di Toledo</hi> wrote, that all the Grandies, yea, the Biſhops themſelues did fauour the new opinions, to ſettle and augment their owne eſtates. Notwithſtanding all this, all the Cardinals, except the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> were of opinion to open the Councell, remoouing the ſuſpenſion. The Pope ſaid the Councell ſhould begin at Saint <hi>Martins</hi> tide; and conſidering the imminent dangers, and the hopes to ouercome them, he <note place="margin">His comfort is, that the loſſe will be greater to the French King then to the Apoſtolike Sea.</note> reſolued himſelfe, and did comfort alſo the Cardinals and his other depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants with it, that the loſſe would be great to <hi>France,</hi> and little to him. For the Apoſtolike Sea receiueth yeerly out of that Kingdome but fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand crownes, but on the other ſide, the Kings authority being great, granted by the Popes, to diſpoſe of Benefices, hee would looſe it all, in regard the Popes authoritie being taken away, the <hi>Pragmatike</hi> wold take place, and the Biſhops would be elected by the Canons, the Abbats by the Monaſteries, and the King bereaued of all this. Therefore hee was ſorry for nothing but for the loſſe of ſo many ſoules. But if GOD would correct them for their faults and infidelity, he could not helpe it.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of Nouember Letters came to <hi>Rome</hi> from the Emperor; <note place="margin">The Emperor writeth to the Pope againſt the commua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the old Councell, and ſo the conuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a new.</note> in which he ſaid, though in generall termes, that, concerning the Councell, hee would doe, for his owne perſon, whatſoeuer the Pope pleaſed; but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that, to hold a Councell out of <hi>Germanie,</hi> or to continue that of <hi>Trent,</hi> by taking away the ſuſpenſion, would doe no good, but raiſe a greater hatred
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:17208:227"/>
in the Proteſtants, with danger that they would endeuour to hinder it with Armes; in which kinde hee had heard of diuers treaties: but, making a new Councell, there was hope to perſwade them to goe thither. This cauſed va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of opinions amongſt the Cardinals, it being plaine, that, if there were not a continuation of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> all the things already determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned would be vaine and voide, hauing neuer beene confirmed by any Pope. This was propoſed in Congregation by his Holineſſe, whereof they conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Wherein the Cardinals are diuided in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion.</note> and ſpake much, without giuing of voyces; which being demanded in another Congregation, <hi>Carpi</hi> ſhewed at large, that it was neceſſary to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the Councell, remoouing the ſuſpenſion onely, and was followed by <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> and <hi>Piſano.</hi> But the Cardinall of <hi>Trent,</hi> who was next, ſaid, that in a matter where they were to treat <hi>de ſumma rerum,</hi> full of ſo many difficulties, it was better to thinke a little more on it. And this opinion was followed by all the other Cardinals. And, fitly, the next euening a Currier came in haſte, to <hi>Rome</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> with proteſtations from the King, that, if the generall <note place="margin">The proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the French King ſent to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> Councell were not called, he could no longer deferre the Nationall: and that they were not to thinke of <hi>Trent,</hi> or any place in <hi>Italie,</hi> in regard the Councell hauing been deſired ſo many yeeres for the neceſsities of <hi>Germany,</hi> and now the danger of <hi>France</hi> beeing added, it was meete to holde it in a conuenient place for both the nations: otherwiſe it would bee in vaine, if the Germanes and French-men went not thither, adding, that if any place in <hi>France</hi> were choſen, it ſhould be moſt ſecure. In the end the Pope thought not fit to delay it any more, but the fifteenth of Nouember reſolued in the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory to make, the next Sunday, a Proceſsion, in ſackecloth and aſhes, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">A Proceſſion and Iubelie for the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to celebrate the Councell.</note> a Iubelie, and ſinging the Maſſe of the holy Ghoſt, for the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made to celebrate the Councell in <hi>Trent;</hi> concluding that if, after it was aſſembled, it ſeemed commodious to tranſlate it to another place, hee would doe it, and goe himſelfe alſo in perſon, ſo that it were ſecure. He added, that he could finde Armes to vſe, if any went about to infringe the things determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and began to conſider of the tenour of the Bull. Euery day a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">A great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in <hi>Rome</hi> whether the continuation ſhould plainly be declared.</note> was held, to reſolue whether they ſhould plainely declare the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, taking away the ſuſpenſion (as he deſired) that the things determined might not be diſputed on againe, or examined. The Imperialiſts, and French men laboured much with the Pope and the Deputies, that it might be called a new Councel, that the Dutch and French-men might go thither, ſaying, they might reſolue in it, that the things already handled might not be handled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, otherwiſe it were in vaine to ſpeake of a Councell to reduce the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, giuing them occaſion at the firſt to refuſe it, and to ſay they could not ſubmit themſelues to thoſe who haue condemned them before they were heard. On the contrary, the Spaniards and Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> who was then in <hi>Rome,</hi> laboured that the ſuſpenſion only might be remoued, and a continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion declared. The Pope and deputies tooke a middle way hoping both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would be ſatisfied. A Iubelie was publiſhed and ſent into all places, and the 24. day the Pope, with the Colledge of Cardinals, &amp; all the Court, went on foote, with a ſolemne Proceſſion, from S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church to <hi>Minerua,</hi> in which there was great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion.

            <p>The 29. day the Conuocation of the Councell was publiſhed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, the Bul wherof was intitled, of the <hi>Intimation</hi> of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> the Latine word was <hi>Indictionis.</hi> And it was ſo printed in many places, though afterwards when the whole body of the Councell was printed, the word, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrationis,</hi> was vſed. The tenor of the Bull was;</p>
            <p>That the Pope, from the beginning of his aſſumption, did apply his mind <note place="margin">The Bull of the intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Councell.</note> to the rooting out of hereſies, extinction of diuiſions, and amendment of manners; for remedie whereof he reſolued to celebrate a generall Councell, that <hi>Paul</hi> the third, and <hi>Iulius</hi> had aſſembled it before, but could not finiſh it; and relating all the occurrences vnder thoſe Popes, aſcribeth the ſucceſſe to diuers impediments, promoted by the enemy of mankinde, at the leaſt, to deferre ſo great a benefit of the Church, which hee could not abſolutely hinder; ſaying, that in the meane while the hereſies and diuiſions were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied. But it hauing pleaſed GOD to giue peace to Chriſtian Kings and Princes, he conceiued hope to put an end to the euils of the Church, by means of the Councell, which hee would not deferre any longer, that hee-might take away ſchiſme, and hereſies, reforme manners, and preſerue peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians. Therefore, by the counſell of the Cardinals, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Emperour elected, and other Kings and Princes, whom hee hath found ready to helpe forward the celebration, by the authoritie of GOD, and of the holy Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> hee doth intimate a generall Councell, in the Citie of <hi>Trent,</hi> to begin at Eaſter, remoouing all ſuſpenſion whatſoeuer, exhorting, and commanding, vnder the canonicall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all Patriarkes, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbats, and others, who haue a deciding voyce by law, priuiledge, or ancient cuſtome, not beeing lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hindered, to bee there before that day; admoniſhing thoſe alſo in the ſame manner, who haue, or may haue any intereſt there; praying the Emperour, Kings, and Princes; to ſend their Proctors, if they cannot be perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and to cauſe their Prelates to performe their duetie without excuſe or delay, and to make the paſſage free and ſecure, for them and their company, as himſelfe will doe within his Territories, hauing no other end in celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Councell, but the honour of GOD, the reducing of the diſperſed ſheepe; and the perpetuall peace of Chriſtendome; ordaining that the Bull ſhould be publiſhed in <hi>Rome:</hi> and that by vertue thereof after the end of two moneths, it ſhall binde all that are comprehended, as if it had been perſonally intimated vnto them.</p>
            <p>The Pope thought hee had ſatisfied himſelfe, thoſe who would haue a <note place="margin">Did not pleaſe either party.</note> new Councell intimated, and thoſe who deſired a continuation of the old. But as middle counſels doe vſually diſpleaſe both parties, ſo the Pope gaue ſatisfaction to none, as ſhall be declared. Preſently after the publication of the Bull the Pope ſent <hi>Nicheto</hi> into <hi>France</hi> with it, with commiſſion, if the forme did not pleaſe, to ſay, that they ſhould not except againſt the word <hi>Continuare,</hi> becauſe it did not hinder them to ſpeake againe of the things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready propoſed. Hee ſent it alſo to the Emperour, and King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> He
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:17208:228"/>
ſent likewiſe <hi>Zacharias Delphinus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lieſina,</hi> to the Princes of high <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Ioannes Franciſcus Comendone,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Zante,</hi> to thoſe of Lowe <hi>Germany,</hi> with letters to them all, and with order, firſt to receiue inſtruction from the Emperour how to treate with them, and then to execute their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage. He ſent alſo the Abbat <hi>Martinengo</hi> to the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> to inuite her and her Biſhops to the Councell, beeing perſwaded ſo to doe by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Edward Cerne,</hi> who promiſed him that his <hi>Nuncio</hi> ſhould be receiued <note place="margin">The Queene of <hi>England</hi> is inuited to the Councell.</note> by one halfe of the Kingdome, by the Queenes conſent. And although the Pope was put in minde to ſend <hi>Nuncij</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and to Princes elſewhere, who doe profeſſe open ſeparation from the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> would be a diſrepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to him, yet hee anſwered hee would humble himſelfe to hereſie, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whatſoeuer was done to gaine ſoules to CHRIST, did beſeeme that Sea. For the ſame reaſon alſo he ſent <hi>Canobius</hi> into <hi>Polonia,</hi> with deſſeigne to make him to goe into <hi>Moſcouia,</hi> to inuite that Prince and Nation to the Councell, though they haue neuer acknowledged the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards he returned to ſpeake of the Councell in Conſiſtory, deſiring to be informed of the learned men, of good life and opinion, of diuers. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, fit to diſpute and perſwade the trueth, ſaying he purpoſed to call ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them; promiſing that, after hee had vſed all poſſible diligence to make all Chriſtians come thither, and to vnite them in Religion, though ſome, or many, refuſed to come, he would not forbeare to proceede. Yet he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, becauſe the Proteſtants of <hi>Germanie,</hi> vnto whom a great part of <hi>France</hi> was vnited, would denie to come, or would demand exorbitant things, which hee could not grant them, and doubted they might bee able to diſturbe the Councell with Armes. Neither did hee hope to be aſſiſted by the Emperour againſt them, in regard of his ſmall forces. Hee confeſſed that the dangers were great, and the remedies ſmall, and was perplexed and troubled in mind. The Bull of the Councel going through <hi>Germany,</hi> fell into Proteſtants hands, aſſembled at the mariage of the Duke of <hi>Salzemburg,</hi> who did intimate a Diet in <hi>Namburg,</hi> to begin the twentieth of Ianuary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vergerius</hi> wrote a booke againſt this Bull, in which, after a great inuectiue <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vergerius</hi> writeth a booke againſt the Bull.</note> againſt the pompe, luxury, and ambition of the Court, hee ſaid, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was called by the Pope, not to eſtabliſh the doctrine of CHRIST, but the ſeruitude and oppreſſion of poore ſoules; that none were called, but thoſe who were bound by oath to the Pope, ſo that not onely all were excluded who are ſeparated from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but alſo men of the greateſt vnderſtanding amongſt themſelues, taking away all liberty, in which onely there was hope of agreement.</p>
            <p>At this time newes came to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the French King had impriſoned <note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and a guard is ſet vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>

They aſſembled almoſt publikely, with much diſcontent and indignation of the people, and danger of ſection. Hereupon the Kings mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the chiefe of the Counſell reſolued to hold the States in <hi>Orliens,</hi> and began to doe it the 13. of December.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other things, there propoſed for the benefit of the Kingdome, <note place="margin">The States are held in <hi>Orliens</hi> Where the Chancellor beginneth to ſpeake.</note> the Chancellor ſaid, that religion is the moſt potent weapon, ouercommeth all affections, and charitie, and is the foreſt bond of humane ſociety; that Kingdomes are more bounded and more diuided by Religion, then by the confines themſelues; that he that is moued with Religion, contemneth wife, children, and kinred. If there be difference of religion in the ſame familie, the father agreeth not with his ſonnes, nor the brothers among themſelues, nor the huſband with the wife. To remedie theſe diſorders, there is neede of a Councell, which the Pope hath promiſed: but in the meane while, it is not to be tolerated, that euery one ſhould ſhape out his owne religion, and bring in new Rites at his pleaſure, and ſo trouble the publique pence. If the Councell faile by the Popes default, the King will make prouiſion another way: but it was neceſſary that euery one ſhould amend himſelfe, becauſe a good life is a vehement orator to perſwade; that the names of Lutheranes, Hugonots, and Papiſts, no leſſe factious then thoſe of the <hi>Guelphes</hi> and <hi>Ghibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,</hi> were to be taken away, and Armes to be taken againſt thoſe who couer their auarice, ambition, and deſire of innouation, with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Emperour, hauing conſulted <note place="margin">The Emperor excepteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Bul of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> with his Diuines concerning the Bull of the Councell, wrote to the Pope, that as <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> hee could totally adhere to the will of his Holineſſe, and bee content with any forme of the Bull, and endeauour that all <hi>Germanie</hi> ſhould ſubmit themſelues to him; but as Emperour hee could ſay nothing, vntill he was enformed what was done by the <hi>Nuncij,</hi> and his Ambaſſadours, who went to the Diet of the Proteſtants in <hi>Neumburg.</hi> Hee was almoſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that if the Pope had not declared, that the conuocation of the Councel was not a continuation, but a new <hi>Indiction,</hi> or that the points already deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded might bee reuiewed, and handled againe, the Bull would haue been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. The French King wrote to his Ambaſſadour in <hi>Rome</hi> the laſt of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, <note place="margin">And ſo doth the French King.</note> that there were ſome things to bee reformed in the Bull before hee could receiue it. For although the word <hi>Indictio,</hi> was vſed in the title, yet in the body of it there were words which did ſignifie the remoouing of the ſuſpenſions of the Councell already begun, which <hi>Germanie</hi> ſuſpecting, would vndoubtedly require an interpretation of them: which would draw the Councell in length, and not giuing the Emperour ſatisfaction, and them, would cauſe ſo many diuiſions in Chriſtendome, and ſo many difficulties, that it would be a Councell in ſhew onely, without fruit or profit. That, for his part he was pleaſed that <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould bee the place, nor made any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence whether it were a new <hi>Indiction,</hi> or a continuation, in regard his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe was willing, as hee was told by <hi>Nicheto,</hi> that the determinations al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made may be diſputed, and examined againe: wherein, as the reall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance would giue ſatisfaction to all, ſo to take away feare, and ſecure eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, it was neceſſary to declare ſo much before hand, taking care to ſatisfie the Emperour by all meanes, without whom no good ſucceſſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell could bee hoped for. Hee ſayd, that if all this were not performed, hee would, as the purpoſe of his brother was, call a Nationall Councell, which was the onely remedy for the neceſſities of his Kingdome. Hee gaue order to his Ambaſſadour alſo to complaine to his Holineſſe, that his brother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing procured with ſuch earneſt entreaty, the opening of the Councell, yet
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:17208:231"/>
no honourable mention was particularly made of him in the Bull; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof euery one knew to bee, becauſe hee would not name the French King immediately after the Emperour. Notwithſtanding all theſe reſpects, the King, to promote the buſineſſe of Religion wrote at the ſame time to the Prelates of his Kingdome, to prepare themſelues to goe to the Councell, and to bee there at the time of the Conuocation: of which letter he ſent a copie to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rope was aduertiſed by his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> that the King ſpake againſt the <note place="margin">To whom the Pope anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</note> Bull, by inſtigation of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and, after hee heard the Ambaſſadours propoſition, he anſwered, That hee maruelled that the King, who doeth not acknowledge any ſuperiour, would ſubiect himſelfe to the diſcretion of another Prince, &amp; not referr himſelfe to the Vicar of CHRIST, to whom it belongeth to moderate whatſoeuer doeth concerne Religion; ſaying, that his Bull was approoued by all others, and had no neede of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and that he was reſolued it ſhould ſtand as it did. That, for naming the French King, he had not thought of it, and that the Cardinals, to whome the compoſition of it was committed, thought it ſufficient to name the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and all Kings in generall; otherwiſe, naming one in particular, it would haue beene neceſſary to haue done the like in all the reſt; that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe tooke care onely of the ſubſtance of the Bull, leauing all the reſt to the Cardinals. This anſwere did not ſatisfie the Frenchmen, who thought their preeminence was not to be paſſed ouer in generall termes, in regard as well of their greatneſſe, as of their merits towards the Apoſtolique Sea. In the end, the Pope gaue them contentment, ſaying hee could not haue his eye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all things, but would be carefull not to commit any errour hereafter. Yet he made no great account of that kingdome, ſeeing that, without any reſpect of his authoritie, they intermedled in things properly belonging to him: as in pardoning heretiques, and ordering things Eccleſiaſticall, though reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">The Pope doeth not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> to himſelfe. For the States aſſembled in <hi>Orleance</hi> in Ianuary, did ordaine that the Biſhops ſhould be elected by the Clergie, with the aſſiſtance of the Iudges of the King, twelue of the Nobilitie, and as many of the people; that no money ſhould be ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Annats;</hi> that all Biſhops and Curates ſhould reſide perſonally, vpon paine of looſing the fruits of their Benefices; that in euery Cathedrall Church a Prebend ſhould bee reſerued for a Reader in Diuinity, and another for a Schoolmaſter, that all Abbats, Abbeſſes, Priors, and Prioreſſes ſhould be ſubiect to the Biſhops, notwithſtanding any exemption; that nothing ſhould bee exacted for adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for Burials, or other publique functions; that Prelates ſhould not vſe cenſures, but for publique faults and ſcandals; that women ſhould not make profeſſion to be of any religious order, before the age of twenty yeeres, nor men before the age of fiue and twenty, vntill which time they might diſpoſe of their goods to whom they pleaſed, except to the Monaſtery; that the Eccleſiaſtiques ſhould not receiue Legacies, or any thing left vnto them or giuen them by laſt will. And other things alſo were ordained, for better reformation of the Church, and of the Clergie, which though they were not then publiſhed, yet the <hi>Nuncio</hi> ſent them to the Pope, and thoſe that gouerned France, thought it ſufficient to giue ſatisfaction in ſhew onely, to

            <p>But, on the contrary, the Kings Diuines in <hi>Spaine</hi> did not approoue the Bull, becauſe it did not plainely ſay, it was a continuation of the Councell already begun, yea, they thought, though the affectation of ambiguity were manifeſt, that it was plainely a new intimation, and ſome of them held, that <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth againſt the Bull.</note> it might be drawen from the words of a cleare conſequence, that the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations made already in <hi>Trent,</hi> might be reexamined; which they ſaid was dangerous, would embolden the Proteſtants, and might cauſe a new diuiſion amongſt the Catholiques.

To thoſe that were afraid, in regard of the contrary opinions of ſo great Princes, hee anſwered, that as a louing father, hee had inuited all, but that hee eſteemed the Proteſtants as loſt, and that the Catholiques of <hi>Germanie</hi> could not adhere to the Councell without making a ſeparation from the others, and raiſing a warre: and if any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Prince would forſake him, hee would proceede by his owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as did <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, without the French King.

by the right of the Republique, becauſe it was no more in being.

            <p>The time prefixed to begin the Councell approaching, the Pope, not to <note place="margin">The Pope ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents for the Councell.</note> faile in any thing that was to bee performed by him, deputed Legate to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, <hi>Hercules Gonzaga,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> a man eminent, in regard of the greatneſſe of his houſe, of his brother <hi>Ferandus,</hi> and of his owne vertue. Hee vſed the Emperour to perſwade him to accept, and was confident of his worth and dexteritie. To him hee ioyned <hi>Iacobus Puteus,</hi> of <hi>Nizza,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Lawyer, who was exerciſed a long time, firſt in the <hi>Rota,</hi> and then in the <hi>Signature;</hi> ſaying that hee purpoſed to make three more, and that; if hee could not finde able men in the Colledge, hee would create new Cardinals, Diuines, and Lawyers, men of honeſty, for this imployment. And hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Congregation of Cardinals and Prelates, to giue order for all things neceſſary for the beginning of the Councell in <hi>Trent,</hi> at the time appointed: and letters came very fitly from the French King; and, in conformity of <note place="margin">The French King accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Bull.</note> them, his Ambaſſadour, <hi>Mounſiear</hi> of <hi>Angoleſme,</hi> did declare vnto him, that he was content with the Councel vpon any tearmes, being deſirous to ſee the effect of it, and that fruit which all Chriſtendome did require. And he ſent <hi>Mounſieur de Ramboullet</hi> expreſſely vnto him, to make the ſame requeſt, and to repreſent vnto him the neceſſities of <hi>France,</hi> and to tell him of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance made vnto him herein, by the States aſſembled in <hi>Orliens;</hi> ſignifying vnto him, that, if this remedie were not quickly applyed, hee ſhould bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to receiue a medicine in his owne Kingdome, by an Aſſembly of his Prelates, in regard there was no meanes to compoſe the differences of Religion, but by a free Generall Councell, or, in defect thereof, by a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. The Pope anſwered that none did deſire the Councel more then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the delay whereof proceeded not from him, but from the diuers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:17208:232"/>
of Princes, for whoſe ſatisfaction he had giuen ſuch a forme to the Bull, as ſeemed moſt fit to content them all. They changed their opinion in <hi>France,</hi> becauſe, beeing in as bad a ſtate as might bee, thought that euery mutation made elſewhere would better their condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viterbo</hi> wrote out of <hi>Spaine</hi> that the King did approoue his propoſitions, and that, after ſome conſultation with his Prelates, was finally reſolued to accept the Bull, without making any difficultie, and to ſend his Prelates as <note place="margin">And ſo doth the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </note> ſoone as the ſeaſon was fit for trauell, and an honourable Ambaſſage, to aſſiſt in the Councell. Hee ſent aduice alſo that the Prelates of <hi>Portugall</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready parted from their houſes, and that the King would ſend an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; but that he had perceiued that ſome of thoſe Prelates had a purpoſe, <note place="margin">The Pope is troubled with the deſigne of the <hi>Portugal</hi> Diuines.</note> that the ſuperioritie of the Councell aboue the Pope ſhould be defined in the Synode, which point they had ſtudied, and cauſed many Diuines to doe the like. The Pope was troubled with this aduice, and conſidered what hee might looke for when the Prelates were aſſembled in the Councell, and did treate altogether, who had ſuch high thoughts before they parted from home, and feared that the King and his Counſell had a finger in it. Yet, as a wiſe Prince, hee conſidered, that when the Councell was held, not that nouitie onely would be propoſed, but many more to the diſaduantage of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as well as of himſelfe: ſaying that euery weight had his counterpoyſe, and that of the things that are attempted, not one in a thouſand doeth take effect.</p>
            <p>Hee was more attentiue to the enterpriſes of the French-men, as beeing more imminent, and of perſons who are not flegmaticall in reſoluing, as the Spaniards are. Therefore hee imparted to the Ambaſſadour euery aduice that came vnto him, and told him in diuers conferences, that they were not to thinke of Nationall Councels, aſſemblies, or <hi>Colloquies,</hi> in matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe hee could not but eſteeme them all for ſchiſmaticall; that hee prayed the King not to vſe thoſe remedies, which would certainely reduce <hi>France,</hi> not onely into a worſe condition, but into the worſt of all; that the difficulties of <hi>Spaine</hi> being remooued, the Councell ſhould certainly be ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, becauſe thoſe which doe continue in <hi>Germanie</hi> are not conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; that the Catholique Princes and Biſhops will conſent and perhaps the Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> alſo, as hee hath made ſhew, by ſeparating himſelfe from the others aſſembled in <hi>Neumburg;</hi> that hee hoped the Emperour would aſſiſt perſonally, if there were neede, as himſelfe did promiſe to doe, if hee thought it fit, wherein hee would not ſubiect himſelfe to the iudgement of any but himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Eaſter drawing neere, which time was appointed to begin the Councell, <note place="margin">One of the Preſidents falleth ſicke, and another is put in his place.</note> and Cardinall <hi>Puteus</hi> being very ſicke, hee put in his roome Friar <hi>Ierolamus,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Seripando</hi> a Diuine of much fame, and cauſed him to depart preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to paſſe by <hi>Mantua,</hi> taking with him the other Legate, and to bee at <hi>Trent</hi> at the time appointed. Notwithſtanding which commandement they came not thither vntil the third feaſt of the reſurrection, and found there nine Biſhops who were arriued before them. The Pope was diligent to make the Italian Biſhops put themſelues in order; and therefore wrote effect all errors to the Vice-roy of Naples, and to his <hi>Nuncio</hi> there, and cauſed his Miniſters to
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:17208:233"/>
perſwade the Biſhops of the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> to bee ready for their iourney to the Councell, as ſoone as might be. Hee deſired alſo the State of <hi>Venice</hi> to ſend the Biſhops of their Territories in <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Candia, Dalmatia,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> with all poſſible expedition, and to create Ambaſſadors, to aſſiſt in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in the name of that Republike. The Italian Prelats were not eaſily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, becauſe they knew the beginning could not be before the conſent of the <note place="margin">The Italian Prelates are not ſo haſty to goe to the Councel as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope would haue had them</note> Emperour did come: which was ſtill prolonged, becauſe the Spaniards and French-men were expected, before whoſe arriuall in <hi>Italy</hi> they thought it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to goe to <hi>Trent.</hi> And many of them, eſpecially the Courtiers, could not beleeue but that the Pope did counterfeit. But the trueth was that, being aſſured he could not auoide the Councell, hee did deſire to ſee it quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Hee ſaid he knew what incouenience the prolongation did cauſe, but knew not what the celebration might doe: and thought that the enemies of his owne perſon, and of the Apoſtolique Sea might doe him more hurt in the time of the expectation, then they could doe in the Councell it ſelfe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a reſolute nature, hee vſed the Prouerbe; It is better to prooue the euill once, then alwayes to feare it.</p>
            <p>While theſe delayes were vſed, the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> made a compoſition <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> maketh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

It was agreed alſo that the Duke might ſend away which of their Paſtors he pleaſed, and that they might prouide themſelues of others; that the Roman Religion might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in all places, but no man inforced to profeſſe it. The Pope was much diſtaſted that an Italian Prince, aſſiſted by him, and not ſo potent but that <note place="margin">Which giueth diſtaſte to the Pope.</note> hee might ſtill haue neede of him, ſhould permit heretikes to liue freely in his ſtate: and the example did trouble him aboue all, becauſe it would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to him by greater Princes, when they would permit another religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Hee made a bitter complaint hereof in the Conſiſtorie, comparing the miniſters of the Catholique King with that Duke, who hauing, at the ſame time, diſcouered three thouſand Lutherans, who went out of <hi>Coſenza,</hi> and retired themſelues to the mountaines, to liue according to their doctrine, did hang ſome, burne others, and put the reſt into the Galleys; and hee exhorted all the Cardinals to thinke of a remedie. But there was great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene

oppreſſing a few diſarmed perſons, farre from helpe, and ouer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a great number of armed men in a place aduantagious for them, with potent ſuccours at their ſhoulders. The Duke ſent to iuſtific his cauſe, and the Pope, not able to anſwere his reaſons was pacified.</p>

               </note> Prelates was put in order: in which, howſoeuer the Ambaſſadour aſſured the Pope, that nothing ſhould bee ſpoken of doctrine, nor any thing preludici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to his authority, but onely a courſe ſet downe how to pay the Kings debts, to prouide againſt ſome abuſes, and to conſult what was to bee handled in the generall Councell, yet his Holineſſe was not ſatisfied, yea was of opinion that they thought, that to prouide againſt abuſes, was to hinder the profits of the Court, and that to conſult of the Councel, was to ioyne with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards (whereof hee had ſome intelligence) in the point of the ſupreame power of the Councell, euen ouer the Pope. And, by reaſon of the diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons betweene the Grandies of the Court, ſpread alſo ouer all the Prouinces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euery one ſought to increaſe his faction, there being a great liberty of ſpeaking; the profeſſours of the new religion were plainely diſcouered, and protected by the greateſt about the King, with much indignation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques. Whereupon there were contentions and diſcords throughout the whole Kingdome, calling one another, in ſcorne, <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Hugonots,</hi> the Preachers making the people tumultuous, and euery one hauing diuers ends. He plainly ſaw, that if the Catholike partie had not all the ſame ayme, ſome great inconuenience would ariſe; for preuenting whereof, and to croſſe thoſe deſſeignes, he thought it neceſſary to haue a Miniſter there, a man of authoritie, and not a French man, who would haue more intereſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then in the ſeruice of the Apoſtolique Sea; and reſolued to ſend a Legatethither. And caſting his eye vpon all the Cardinals, hee made choice <note place="margin">Into which Kingdome he ſendeth for Legate the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
               </note> of <hi>Ferrara</hi> in whom all neceſſary qualities did concurre; ſingular wiſedome, dexteritie in negotiations, nobility of birth, being allied to the Royall houſe of <hi>France,</hi> brother in law to the Kings great Aunt, daughter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 12, and ſo neere a couſin to thoſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> (the Dukes wife being the Cardinals neece) that they could not chuſe but fauour him, in regard of their neereneſſe in blood. He gaue him foure particular Commiſſions; to fauour the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, and oppoſe the Proteſtants; to diuert the Nationall Synode, and <note place="margin">And giueth him foure commiſſions.</note> aſſembly of the Prelates; to ſollicite the going of the Prelates to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; and to cauſe an abrogation of the conſtitutions, made in matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall.</p>
            <p>While the Legate was preparing to goe, there fell our an accident which made the Kings neereſt friends feare the Catholiques, as much as the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. For the fourteenth of Iuly, <hi>Arthurus Defiderius</hi> was apprehended <note place="margin">A ſupplication ſent out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </note> neere to <hi>Orleans,</hi> who was ſent into <hi>Spaine</hi> with a Supplication, written in the name of the Clergie of <hi>France,</hi> in which they demaunded the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtance of that King againſt the Proteſtants, becauſe they could not bee ſuppreſſed by a boy and a woman, with other more ſecret inſtructions in cipher, to be imparted to his Maieſtie. This man being impriſoned, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogated of the confederates, diſcouered ſome, whom it was dangerous to
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:17208:234"/>
make knowen: for which cauſe they reſolued to proceede no further, but condemned him to make honourable ſatisfaction, to teare the ſupplication, and to bee perpetuall priſoner in the Monaſterie of the <hi>Carthuſians.</hi> But many of his confeſſions being divulged, the Kings Counſel thought fit to giue the other partie ſome ſatisfaction. Whereupon the King did prohibite the names of <hi>Hugonotes</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ordaining that no man, vnder pretence of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the Congregations for religion, which were forbid, ſhould enter with <note place="margin">The King maketh an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination in fauour of the Proteſtants.</note> many or few, into another mans houſe; that thoſe who were in priſon for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould be ſet at libertie, and that thoſe which fled, ſince the time of <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt; might returne and repoſſeſſe their goods, in caſe they would liue like Catholiques, or, if they would not, might ſell them, and goe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place. The Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> did oppoſe, and ſaid, it was a kinde of grant of libertie of religion, which was neuer knowen in <hi>France;</hi> that the returne of the fugitiues would cauſe great troubles, and that the libertie to ſell their goods, and goe to another place was againſt the lawes of the Kingdome, which doe not giue leaue to carry foorthany great quantitie of money.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe oppoſitions, the Edict was executed; ſo that the Proteſtants being increaſed in number, and making more and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſemblies then they were wont, the King, with the Queene and Princes, went into the Parliament to prouide a remedy, by the mature counſel of men skilfull in matters of State and Iuſtice. The Chancellour ſaid, they were not to ſpeake of Religion, but of making prouiſion againſt dayly tumults, which did ariſe by the meanes of it; leſt being made licontious, by raiſing of ſtirres, they might lay aſide all obedience to the King. There were three opinions. 1. To ſuſpend all puniſhments againſt the Proteſtants, vntill the deciſion of the Councell. 2. That they ſhould bee capitally proceeded againſt. 3. That they ſhould bee puniſhed by the Ecleſiaſticall Court, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding their Congregations, either publike or priuate, and liberty to preach, or adminiſter the Sacraments, but after the Romane faſhion. In concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they tooke a middle courſe, and made an Edict, which is called the Edict of Iuly. That all ſhould abſtaine from doing iniuries, and liue in peace; <note place="margin">The Edict of Iuly.</note> that the preachers ſhould not rayſe tumults, vpon paine of death; that none ſhould preach or adminiſter the Sacraments, but according to the Romane Rite; that the Eccleſiaſtiques ſhould bee iudges of hereſie; that if the perſon guilty were deliuered to the Secular power, no greater puniſhment ſhould bee inflicted then baniſhment, and this to continue till a Generall or National Councell did determine otherwiſe; that all thoſe who haue mooued any tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, for the cauſe of Religion, ſhould be pardoned, liuing hereafter in peace, and like Catholiques. Afterwards treating how to accommodate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, it was ordained that the Biſhops ſhould meete in <hi>Poiſi,</hi> the tenth <note place="margin">A <hi>Colloquie</hi> is ordained at <hi>Poiſi.</hi>
               </note> of Auguſt, and that the Proteſtant Miniſters ſhould haue a Safe Conduct to come thither. This was contradicted by many of the Catholiques, who thought it ſtrange, diſhonourable, and dangerous to put the Religion of their predeceſſours, receiued vntill that time, to compromiſe, and in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard. <note place="margin">In which the Card of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siques.</note> But they yeelded at the laſt, becauſe the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed largely that hee would confute the heretiques, and take the burden vpon
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:17208:234"/>
himſelfe; wherein hee was aſſiſted by the Queene, who, knowing his deſire to make oſtentation of his witte, was willing to giue him ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>The Pope had newes at once of theſe two Edicts; in which hee found ſome thing to commend, and ſomething to blame. Hee commended the Parliament, for maintaining the cauſe of religion; and blamed it, becauſe they had ordered it contrary to the Decretals, not to proceed to any greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure then baniſhment. His concluſion was, that when the maladie is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the remedie, it ought to be made lighter by patience. But the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger of the aſſembly of the Prelates, eſpecially together with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, he thought was intolerable, and ſaid, he would doe the beſt he could to hinder it; wherein if he ſhould not bee able to preuaile, yet hee was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault. Therefore he treated effectually with the Ambaſſadour, and with the King, by his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> that, ſeeing the Aſſembly could not bee omitted, yet at the leaſt the arriuall of the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrara</hi> might bee expected, that beeing made in preſence of an Apoſtolicall Legate, with abſolute authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it might bee lawfull. Hee wrote alſo to the Prelats, that their power did not extend ſo farre as to make Decrees in matter of Religion, or Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſcipline, and that if they went beyond their bounds, hee would not onely make all voyd, but proceed againſt them with all ſeuerity. Neither the <hi>Nuncio</hi> nor the Ambaſſadour could preuaile, in regard that not onely the Popes aduerſaries did oppoſe, but euen the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> himſelfe, with his adherents; and it was told the <hi>Nuncio</hi> in the Kings name, that the Pope might reſt ſecure, becauſe nothing ſhould bee reſolued on, but by the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Cardinals.</p>
            <p>But for all this, the affaires of the Church did precipitate: and in <hi>Rome</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Councel of the French King determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that the Princes of the Blood ought to precede the Cardinals.</note> it was thought to bee a great fall, that there being a controuerſie for prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie betweene the Cardinals and Princes of the Blood, in the Aſſembly of the States continued in <hi>

                  </gap>outoiſe,</hi> the Kings Counſell did determine it againſt the Cardinals, and the Cardinals <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> and of <hi>Armignac</hi> did yeelde though <hi>Tornon, Loraine,</hi> and <hi>Guiſe</hi> departed, diſdaining and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at their Colleagues. And the Deputie of the third Order, who ſpake againſt the Clergie, was heard with applauſe, obiecting to them ignorance, and luxury, demanding that all iuriſdiction ſhould be taken from them, and the reuenewes, and a Nationall Councell held, wherein the King or Princes of the Blood ſhould preſide; and that in the meane time thoſe, who doe not receiue the Romiſh ceremonies, might aſſemble, and preach, in the preſence of a publike Miniſter of the King, that it might plainly appeare that nothing is done againſt him.</p>
            <p>They treated alſo of applying to the publique a part of the Eccleſiaſticall reuenewes, and many other things againſt that order; and the number of thoſe who did fauour the Proteſtants, did ſtill increaſe. The Clergie, to free themſelues, were forced to promiſe to pay the King foure tenths yeerely, for ſixe yeeres, and ſo the humours, ſtirred againſt them, were quieted. And, <note place="margin">The pope is diſcontented with a letter ſent vnto him by the Queen mother.</note> which was the greateſt precipice, the Queene wrote a long letter to the Pope, dated the fourth of Auguſt, ſhewing the imminent dangers for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Religion, and exhorting him to vſe ſome remedie; ſhee ſayd there
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:17208:235"/>
were ſo many ſeparated from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it was impoſſible to reduce them, either by law or force; that many of the Grandies of the Kingdome did draw others by their example; that there beeing none of them who denie the Articles of Faith, nor the ſixe Councels, many did aduiſe to receiue them into the Communion of the Church; but if this did not pleaſe, and that it ſeemed better to expect a Generall Councell, in the meane ſpace, in regard of the vrgent neceſſitie and danger of delay, it was neceſſary to vſeſome particular remedy, by making <hi>Colloquies</hi> of both parties, by admoniſhing them to abſtaine from iniuries, contentions, and offenſiue words, by cleering the mindes of thoſe who were not aliened as yet, taking from the place of adoration the Images, prohibited by GOD, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by S. <hi>Gregory;</hi> by remoouing from Baptiſme, ſpittle, and exorciſmes, and other things, not inſtituted by the word of GOD; to reſtore the vſe of the <hi>Cup</hi> in the Communion, and prayers in the vulgar tongue; that the firſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in euery moneth, or more often, the Curates ſhould call thoſe who will communicate, and, ſinging Pſalmes in the vulgar, ſhould, in the ſame alſo, pray for the Prince, and Magiſtrates, for the ſalubrity of the ayre, and fruits of the earth; then, expounding the places of the Euangeliſts, and of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> they ſhould come to the Communion; that the Feaſt of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> ſhould be taken away, becauſe it is inſtituted onely for pompe; that if the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue muſt bee vſed in prayers, yet the vulgar ſhould be added, for the benefit of all; that the Popes authority ſhould not be diminiſhed, nor the doctrine changed, in regard it is not iuſt to take away the miniſtery, becauſe the Miniſters haue erred. It was thought that ſhee wrote theſe things at the perſwaſion of <hi>Iohn Monluc,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> with too much French liberty, and they troubled the Pope very much, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the time, full of ſuſpitions, when a Nationall Councell was ſpoken of, and a <hi>Colloquie</hi> intimated in <hi>Poiſi.</hi> Hauing well conſidered all, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to diſſemble, and not to anſwere, but onely that, the Councell drawing neere, whatſoeuer was thought neceſſary might bee there propoſed, with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured hope that no reſolution ſhould bee made but for the ſeruice of GOD, and peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>Theſe occurrences did confirme the Pope in his opinion, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was profitable both for himſelfe and the Court, and that it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to celebrate it for his defence, againſt the preparations which were and might be made. And hee ſhewed tokens of ioy, for the letters which came vnto him, the 24 of Auguſt, from the Emperour, in which hee ſayd that hee <note place="margin">But is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, receiued from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> did abſolutely conſent vnto the Councell, and that hee did not declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vntill then, that hee might more eaſily winne the Princes of <hi>Germanie;</hi> but now, not being able to doe any more, hee prayed him to continue his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours, in haſtening the celebration. Hauing called together all the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of Princes, and moſt of the Cardinals, ſo that it was almoſt a Conſiſtorie, he ſhewed the letters to them all, ſaying, it was worthy to bee written in letters of gold; that the Councell would bee moſt profitable; that it was not to be deferred; that it would be ſovniuerſall that the Citie of <hi>Trent</hi> would not bee able to receiue it, and that it would bee neceſſary to thinke of tranſlating it to a place more large and fertile. His diſcourſe was approoued
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:17208:235"/>
by all that ſtood by, though ſome thought it dangerous to name the <hi>tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the beginning, in regard that euery little ſuſpition might either hinder or delay the Councell. Others beleeued that this would not diſpleaſe the Pope, and that he caſt foorth that word to open a gate where the difficulty might enter.</p>
            <p>It being not onely reſolued, but generally knowen that none of the Dutch Prelates would come to <hi>Trent,</hi> and a doubt made alſo, in regard of the <hi>Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quie</hi> inſtituted, that the French-men would treat onely amongſt themſelues, and that the Councell would conſiſt of noen but <hi>Italians,</hi> except ſome few <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi> were of opinion, that a few of them would ſerue the turne, ſo that many of them vſed meanes to the Pope to bee excepted; who told them plainly, that he was aſſured that all the <hi>Vltramontans</hi> would come, <note place="margin">The <hi>Italians</hi> deſire to be excuſed from going to the Councell, but cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine leaue of the Pope.</note> full of hopes to ſubiect the Popedome to the Councell, which being the common intereſt of <hi>Italie,</hi> whereby it is preferred before other Nations, they ought to goe all thither for the publike defence; that hee would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt any, but rather take all hope from them, ſaying, that they might bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured thereof, ſeeing how diligent he was in ſending the Legats thither. For, beſides the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Scripando,</hi> hee had ſent <hi>Staniſlaus Oſius,</hi> Cardinall of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armia.</hi> The next day, hauing publiſhed the Emperours letters, hee called a generall congregation of all the Cardinals, though it were Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. Hee treated of many particulars concerning the beginning and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of the Councell; and promiſed to aſſiſt the poore Prelats with money, but vpon condition they ſhould goe thither; and allowed them but eight daies to begin their iourney. He ſhewed how neceſſary the Councell was, in regard Religion was baniſhed, or endangered in ſome place euery day. And he ſpake the truth. For in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in an aſſembly of all the Nobilitie of <note place="margin">The <hi>Roman</hi> Catholike re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </note> the kingdome, it was conſtituted that there ſhould be no more exerciſe of the <hi>Romane</hi> Catholique Religion.</p>
            <p>In Auguſt the Prelats did aſſemble in <hi>Poiſt,</hi> where they treated of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Cleargie, without making any concluſion. Afterwards, the Proteſtant Miniſters being come, in number foureteene, who were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſecured by a ſafe conduct, amongſt whom <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> who came from <hi>Zuric,</hi> and <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> who came from <hi>Geneua,</hi> were the chiefe, they gaue a petition to the King which had foure parts. 1. That <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Colloquie <hi>of</hi> Poiſi <hi>in</hi> France.</note> the Biſhops might not be Iudges in that buſineſſe. 2. That the King with his Counſellours would preſide. 3. That the controuerſies might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the word of God. 4. That that which was agreed on, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed might be written by Notaries elected by both parties. The Queene would haue one of the foure Secretaries of the King to write, and graunted that the King ſhould preſide; but ſo, that this ſhould not bee committed to writing, alledging that it was not fit for them, nor profitable for the King, conſidering the preſent times. The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> deſired the Kings preſence in the publique aſſembly, that it might be more frequent, and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to make oſtentation of his worth, promiſing himſelfe a certaine victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Many of the Diuines perſwaded the Queene not to ſuffer the King to bee preſent, that thoſe tender cares might not be enuenomed by peſtiferous doctrine. Before the parties were called to the combat, the Prelats made a
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:17208:236"/>
proceſſion, and did all communicate, except the Cardinall <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> and fiue Biſhops. The other proteſted one to another, that they meant not to handle points of doctrine, nor matters of faith.</p>
            <p>The ſecond of September they began, in preſence of the King, Queene, Princes of the blood, and the Kings Counſellors, together with ſixe Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and fortie Biſhops. The King, as he was inſtructed, made an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, being aſſembled to remedie the tumults of the kingdome, and to <note place="margin">In which the King ſpeaketh biterely.</note> correct the things that were amiſſe he deſired they ſhould not depart before all differences were compoſed. The Chancellor ſpake more at large to the ſame purpoſe, in the Kings name, and ſaid particularly that the diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">And the Chancellor at large.</note> vrgent, did require a preſent cure; that the remedie which could bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Councell, beſides that it would bee ſlow, would proceede from men, who, being ſtrangers, know not the neceſſities of <hi>France,</hi> and are bound to follow the Popes will; that the Prelates preſent, knowing the needs of the kingdome, and neere in blood are more fit to execute this good worke; that although the Councell intimated by the Pope were held, yet the like of this hath beene done at other times, and is not without example; that in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the great many Councels were held at once and that, many times, the error of a generall Councel hath bin corrected by a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, as Arianiſme eſtabliſhed by the generall Councel of <hi>Arimini,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in <hi>France,</hi> by a Councel called by S. <hi>Hilarie.</hi> He exhorted all to ayme at the ſame end, and the more learned not to contemne their inferiors, nor theſe to enuie thoſe; to auoid curlous queſtions; not to bee auerſe from the Proteſtants, who were their brethren, regenerate in the ſame Baptiſme, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the ſame CHRIST. Hee exhorteth the Biſhops to treat with them courteouſly, ſeeking to reduce them, but without ſeueritie, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that much was attributed to them, in that they were ſuffered to be Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in their owne cauſe: ſaying, that this did conſtraine them to proceede with ſinceritie, and that, in ſo doing, they ſhould ſtop the mouth of their aduerſaries, but, tranſgreſſing the office of iuſt Iudges, all would be invaine, and to no purpoſe. The Cardinall <hi>Tornon</hi> roſe vp, and, hauing thanked the King, Queene, and Princes, for the aſſiſtance they affoorded to that aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſaid that the Chancellors propoſitions were of great importance, and not to bee handled, or anſwered vpon the ſudden, and therefore deſired they might bee committed to writing, the better to deliberate vpon them. The Chancellor did refuſe and the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> did vrge it.</p>
            <p>The Queene, perceiuing that this was required by the two Cardinals, to <note place="margin">The Queene mother com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> to begin.</note> draw the buſineſſe in length, gaue order to <hi>Beza</hi> to ſpeake: Who, hauing prayed on his knee, and recited the profeſſion of his faith, complained that they were accounted turbulent, and ſeditious, perturber of the publique peace, though they had no other end then the glory of GOD, nor deſired to aſſemble themſelues but to ſerue him, and obey the Magiſtrates, appointed by him. Then he declared in what they do agree with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in what they diſſent, he ſpake of faith, good workes, of the authoritie of Councels, ſinnes of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline obedience to Magiſtrates, and of the Sacraments and entring into the matter of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> hee ſpake <note place="margin">Who ſheweth too much heate.</note> with ſuch heate, that he gaue but ill ſatisfaction to thoſe of his owne partie;
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:17208:236"/>
ſo that he was commanded to conclude. And hauing preſented the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of his Churches, and deſired it might bee examined, he made an end. The Cardinall <hi>Tornon,</hi> full of diſdaine, roſe vp, and ſaid, that the Biſhops, euen for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their conſciences, had conſented to heare theſe new <hi>Euangeliſts,</hi> fore ſeeing they would ſpeake many iniurious things againſt God, and that but for the reſpect they bare to the King, they would haue riſen, and diſturbed the <note place="margin">Whereat Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Tornon</hi> diſdaineth.</note> aſſembly. Therefore hee prayed his Maieſtie, not to beleeue what they had ſaid, becauſe the Prelates would diſprooue it, ſo that hee ſhould ſee the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the trueth and a lye, and demanded a dayes time to anſwere, requiring that all ſhould bee remooued from thence, that they might not heare thoſe blaſphemies. Wherewith the Queene, thinking her ſelfe to bee touched, anſwered, that nothing was done but by the aduice of the Princes, of the Kings Counſell, and Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> not to change or innouate any thing in Religion, but to compoſe the differences, and to reduce thoſe that wandered into the right way; which the Biſhops were bound in wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to procure, by all good meanes.</p>
            <p>The aſſembly being diſſolued, the Biſhops and Diuines conſulted amongſt themſelues what to doe. Some of them would haue had a <hi>Confeſsion</hi> of Faith written, vnto which if the Proteſtants would not ſubſcribe, they ſhould bee condemned for heretiques, without any further diſputation. Which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſeeming too hard, after much diſcourſe, they reſolued to anſwere two of the points propoſed by <hi>Beza;</hi> that is, of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> The Congregation being aſſembled againe the ſixteenth of the moneth, the <note place="margin">The Card. of <hi>Loraine</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for the Catholiques.</note> Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> in the preſence of the King, Queene, and Princes, made a long Oration, and ſayd; That the King was a member, not head of the Church; that it belonged to his care to defend it, and that, for matter of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, hee was ſubiect to the Eccleſiaſticall Miniſters; that the Church did not containe the elect onely, any yet could not erre; that when any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church is in an errour, recourſe muſt be had to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the generall Councels, conſent of the ancient Fathers, and, aboue all, to the Scripture expounded in the ſenſe of the Church; that the heretiques, failing in this, haue runne into inextricable errours; as the modernes, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, in the point of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> in which, by an incurable itch of curious queſtions, they haue vſed that which was inſtituted by Chriſt for a bond of vnion, to make an irreconciliable rent in the Church. And then he handled this matter, and concluded, that, if the Proteſtants will not change their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion herein, there is no meanes of compoſition.</p>
            <p>When he had made an end, all the Biſhops ſtood vp, and ſaid they would liue and die in that Faith; they prayed the King to perſeuere in it; adding, that if the Proteſtants will ſubſcribe to this article, they will not refuſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the reſt; but if not, they ought not to haue any more audience, but to be chaſed out of the whole kingome. <hi>Beza</hi> asked leaue to anſwere preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <note place="margin">To whom <hi>Beza</hi> was willing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer and was not ſuffered.</note> but it ſeeming not fit to equalize a priuate Miniſter, to ſo great a Prince Cardinall, the aſſembly was diſſolued. The Prelats were willing the <hi>Colloquie</hi> ſhould haue beene thus ended; but the Biſhop of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alence</hi> told them it was diſhonourable. Therefore the foure and twentieth day it was aſſembled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in preſence of the Queene, and the Princes. <hi>Beza</hi> ſpake of the Church, <note place="margin">But ſpeaketh another day.</note>
               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:17208:237"/>
and of the conditions and authority thereof; of Councels, ſhewing they may erre, and the dignity of the Scripture. <hi>Claudeus Espenſeus</hi> anſwered, that hee had alwayes deſired a <hi>Colloquie</hi> in matter of Religion, and abhorred the puniſhments which the poore vnfortunate people endured: but he much marueiled by what authority, and by whom the Proteſtants were called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Eccleſiaſticall miniſtery, who had layd hands on them to make them <note place="margin">And is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by <hi>Claudius E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſeus.</hi>
               </note> ordinary Miniſters, and, if they pretended an extraordinary vocation where were the miracles to demonſtrate it. Then hee treated of Traditions. Hee ſhewed, that there beeing a controuerſie of the ſenſe of the Scriptures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe muſt be had to the Fathers; and that many things are beleeued by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition onely, as the <hi>Conſubſtantialitie</hi> of the Sonne, the baptizing of infants, and the virginity of the mother of Chriſt after his birth. Hee added, that no generall Councell was euer corrected by another in point of doctrine. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers replies and diſputations paſſed on both ſides, betweene the Diuines, who were preſent. And, there being a great contention, the Card of <hi>Loraine</hi> making a ſilence, propoſed the matter of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and ſayd, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were reſolute not to proceede any further, if that Article were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed on; and then demaunded of the Miniſters, if they were prepared to ſubſcribe the <hi>Augustan Confeſsion</hi> in that Article. <hi>Beza</hi> asked whether hee propoſed that in the name of all, and whether himſelfe, and the other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates would ſubſcribe to the other points of that <hi>Confeſsion:</hi> and receiuing no anſwere either of the one or the other, hee demanded, that that which was propoſed to bee ſubſcribed vnto, ſhould bee put in writing, that they might conſult of it; and ſo the <hi>Colloquie</hi> was put off till the next day.</p>
            <p>In which <hi>Beza,</hi> who began to ſpeake, did much prouoke the Biſhops. For hauing iuſtified his vocation to the Miniſterie, he diſcourſed of the vocation <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Beza</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, againe, and prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</note> and ordination of Biſhops, ſhewing what Simonie was committed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding how it could be accounted lawfull. The paſſing to the Article of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and the point of the <hi>Auguſtan Confeſsion</hi> propoſed vnto him, hee ſaid it ought to bee firſt ſubſcribed by thoſe who did propoſe it. The parties not being able to agree, a <hi>Spaniſh Ieſuite,</hi> one of the traine of the Cardinall <note place="margin">The ſaw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ines of a <hi>Spaniſh Ieſuite.</hi>
               </note> of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who was at the <hi>Colloquie,</hi> hauing reproched the Proteſtants, did reprehend the Queene for meddling in matters which belonged not to her, but to the Pope, Cardinals, and Biſhops. This arrogancie troubled the Queenes Patience; but, for the Popes ſake, and the Legates, ſhee diſſembled. Finally, not being able to conclude any thing by this manner of parlie, it was <note place="margin">A new courſe is taken.</note> ordered, that two Biſhops and three Diuines, of the moſt moderate, ſhould conferre with fiue of the Proteſtants Miniſters, to ſee if they could finde out a way to make an agreement. They aſſayed to frame an Article of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Which doth as little good as the former</note> in generall termes, taken out of the Fathers, which might giue ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to both parties, which becauſe they could not doe, they concluded the <hi>Colloquie.</hi> This did miniſter much matter of diſcourſe. Some ſayd it was a bad example to treate of errours once condemned, and that they ought no ſo much as to heare thoſe who denie the foundations of Religion, which hath continued ſo long, and beene ſo much confirmed, eſpecially in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ignorant people; and that, although nothing was reſolued againſt the true Religion, it hath made the heretiques bolde, and grieued the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques.
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:17208:237"/>
Others ſayd, it would bee generally good to handle theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies often, becauſe the parties would by this meanes become familiar; malice and other bad affections would ceaſe, and many wayes of compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be found, and that there was no other courſe to extirpate the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill that had taken ſuch deepe roote. For the Court being diuided vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of religion, it was impoſſible they ſhould be reconciled, except all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie layd aſide, they did tolerate one another, and take that cloake out of the hands of vnquiet and turbulent people, with which they couer their bad actions.</p>
            <p>The Pope, vnderſtanding that the <hi>Colloquie</hi> was diſſolued without doing <note place="margin">Wherwith the Pope is well pleaſed.</note> any thing, was very glad, and much commended the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and <hi>Tornon</hi> more. The zeale of the Ieſuite pleaſed him, and ſayd, hee might be compared to the ancient Saints, hauing, without reſpect of the King and Princes maintained Gods cauſe, and vpbrayded the Queene to her face. On the contrary, hee reprehended the oration of the Chancellour, ſaying, <note place="margin">The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour of <hi>France</hi> is bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in <hi>Rome,</hi> together with the whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of that kingdom.</note> it was hereticall in many parts, and threatned to call him into the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The Court alſo, when it was diuulged to them, was diſtaſted with it, and coniectured that all the gouernours of the Kingdome had the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition toward <hi>Rome;</hi> and the French Ambaſſadour had much adoe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe.</p>
            <p>That which hapned to the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrara</hi> is not to bee omitted, as <note place="margin">The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrara</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> being of affinitie to the matter whereof I write. That Prelate was receiued at the firſt by the King and Queene, with much honour, and hauing preſented the Popes letters of credence, was acknowledged for Legate of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Sea, by their Maieſties, by the Princes, and Clergie. But the Parliament, hauing diſcouered that, amongſt his Commiſſions, one was, to deſire a reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or moderation, at the leaſt, of the things accorded in the States of <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> the laſt of Ianuary, concerning the diſtribution of Benefices, and, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, the prohibition of paying <hi>Annates</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſending money out of the Kingdome to obtaine Benefices there, or other fauours, did immediatly publiſh the Decrees, which had not been puniſhed vntill that time, vnder the date of the thirteenth of September, that the Cardinall might not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his purpoſe; and did reſolue not to giue the Legate leaue to vſe the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> giuen him by the Pope. For the cuſtome of that kingdome is, that a Legate cannot exerciſe his office, if his <hi>Faculties</hi> be not firſt preſented, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined in Parliament, and regulated and moderated by a decree thereof, and confirmed in that forme by the Kings Briefe; ſo that when the Bull of the <hi>Faculties</hi> of the Legation was preſented, to bee, as they ſay, approoued, it was refuſed by the Chancellour and Parliament, alleadging that it was already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to vſe any more diſpenſations againſt the rules of the Fathers, nor collation of Benefices againſt the Canons. But the Cardinall had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter affront, in that Paſquins were made, and ſpread, both in the Court and Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> concerning the loues of <hi>Lucretia Borgia,</hi> his mother, and Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, his Grand-father by the mothers ſide, with repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the obſcenities, diuulged throughout all <hi>Italy</hi> in the time of that Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which made the Cardinall ridiculous to the people.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing hee vndertooke was to hinder the preaching of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatiſts,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:17208:238"/>
who after the <hi>Colloquie,</hi> did practiſe it more freely then before, and vſed perſwaſions, and made ſecret promiſes to the Miniſters. And becauſe hee had no credit with them, in regard of his kinred with the houſe of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> for which reaſon alſo he was held ſuſpected by all the oppoſites of that fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to gaine reputation, he made acquaintance with the Nobles of the Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faction, and went to their feaſts, and ſometimes was preſent at their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons <note place="margin">His familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Hugonots.</note> in the habit of a Gentleman. By all which he gained nothing, becauſe many thought he did it as Legate, by conſent of the Pope, and the Court of <note place="margin">Diſpleaſeth the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Rome</hi> was diſpleaſed with his actions.</p>
            <p>The Queene of <hi>France,</hi> vnderſtanding that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> tooke the <hi>Colloquie</hi> in ill part, ſent <hi>Iaques de Montbrun</hi> expreſly to him; who made a large <note place="margin">The Q. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſendeth an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour into <hi>Spaine</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie.</hi>

The King anſwered him in generall words, and referred him to the Duke of <hi>Alua;</hi> who, hauing heard his Ambaſlage, ſaid, that the King was ſory that, in a kingdome ſo neere, and ſo neerely allied to him in kinred, religion ſhould be ſo ill handled; that there was neede of that ſeuerity which <hi>Henry</hi> vſed, in a Mercuriall Congregation, and <hi>Francis</hi> in <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> not long ſince; hee prayed the Queene to make prouiſion, in regard, the danger of <hi>France</hi> belonging to him alſo, hee was reſolued by the aduice of his Councell, to imploy all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and his life alſo to extinguiſh the common peſtilence; whereunto he was ſollicited by the Grandies and people of <hi>France.</hi> The wiſe Spaniards thought <note place="margin">The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards would haue cured y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maladies of <hi>Flanders,</hi> with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine of <hi>France.</hi>

of <hi>Burbon,</hi> whereunto <hi>Ferneſe</hi> hauing giuen conſent, the Ambaſſador ſpake of it to the Pope in the name of him, and of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> ſaying; that his Holineſſe would be freed from charge, and the Citie ſecured from the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots,</hi> who would not attempt ought againſt it, being in the protection of a Prince of the blood. Not onely thoſe who were skilfull in the affaires of the world, but euery one of any meane iudgement, knew that this was done to take with eaſe the dominion of that Citie from <hi>Rome,</hi> and vnite it to <hi>France.</hi> Therefore the Pope denied it abſolutely, and related the propoſition in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorie, as if ſome great preiudice had beene concealed vnder it, which did not appeare at the firſt ſight. And he much complained of the Queene and King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> who hauing often promiſed him that nothing ſhould bee done in <hi>France</hi> againſt his authoritie, yet they did fauour hereſies, and were authors of the Congregations of the Prelates, <hi>Colloquies,</hi> and of other preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall things.

The moſt diſcreete amongſt them anſwered, that the demand did deſerue great deliberation, and that they durſt not reſolue vntill they had well conſidered of it; others were paſſionate, as at newes neuer heard of before. The Cardinall of <hi>Cueua</hi> ſayd, that he would neuer giue his voyce in fauour of ſuch a demand, and that if it were ſo reſolued by authority of his Holineſſe, and the conſent of the Cardinals, hee would goe to the top of the ſtaires of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and crie <hi>(miſericordia)</hi> with a loud voyce; not forbearing to ſay that the Prelates of <hi>France</hi> were infected with hereſie. The Cardinall Saint <hi>Angelo</hi> anſwered, that hee would neuer giue a <hi>Cup</hi> full of ſuch deadly poyſon to the people of <hi>France,</hi> in ſtead of a medicine, and that it was better to let them die; then cure them with ſuch remedies. To whom the Ambaſſadour replied; that the Prelates of <hi>France</hi> were induced to bee of this opinion with good grounds, and Theologicall reaſons, which deſerued not ſuch a contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cenſure; and, on the other ſide, that it was not fit to giue the name of poyſon to the Blood of CHRIST, and to call the holy Apoſtles poyſoners, and the Fathers of the Primitiue Church, and of that which followed for many hundreds of yeeres, who, with much ſpirituall profit, haue miniſtred the Cup of that Blood to all the people.</p>
            <p>The Pope, beeing entred into the Conſiſtory, hauing diſcourſed with <note place="margin">For which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards hee was ſory.</note> ſome Cardinals, and better thought of the buſineſſe, wiſhed hee had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to recall his word.

The Cardinals who were dependants on <hi>France,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended with diuers formes of words the Kings intention, but, concerning the requeſt, referred themſelues to his Holineſſe. The Spaniards did all oppoſe; and vſed great boldneſſe of ſpeach, ſome calling the Prelates of <hi>France</hi> heretiques, ſome ſchiſmatiques, and ſome vnlearned, alleadging no reaſon but that all CHRIST is in both the kinds. The Cardinall <hi>Pacceco</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that all diuerſities of rites, eſpecially in the moſt principall ceremonies doe end with ſchiſme and hatred. For now the Spaniards in <hi>France</hi> goe to the French Churches, and the French men in <hi>Spaine</hi> to the Spaniſh, but when they ſhal communicate ſo diuerſly, one not receiuing the Communion of the other, they will be forced to make Churches apart; and ſo behold a diuiſion.</p>

               </gap> of him that demaundeth the fauour. For the Pope cannot giue power to doe enill; but it is an hereticall euill to receiue the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, thinking it to bee neceſary; therefore the Pope cannot grant it to ſuch perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it cannot bee doubted but that thoſe who demand it doe iudge it neceſſary, becauſe no man maketh any great matter of indifferent ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. Hee ſaid that theſe men doe hold the Chalice either to bee neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or not: if not, why doe they giue ſcandall, by making themſelues dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from others? if otherwiſe, then they are heretiques and vncapable of the <hi>grace.</hi> The Cardinall <hi>Rodolpbo Pio di Carpi,</hi> who was one of the laſt that ſpake, becauſe the inferiours doe begin, concluded in conformitie with the others, that not onely the ſauing of two hundred thouſand ſoules, but one onely was a ſufficient cauſe to diſpence with any poſitiue law, with wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and maturity; but in that propoſition one ought to take heede, leſt, thinking to game two hundred thouſand, hee loſe two hundred millions. That it was manifeſt, that this would not bee the laſt demand of the French men in matter of religion, but a ſtep to propoſe another, that afterward they will demand the marriage of Prieſts, the vulgar tongue in the miniſtery of the Sacraments: which will haue the ſame ground, becauſe they are <hi>de iure poſitiuo,</hi> and muſt be granted for the preſeruation of many. Of the marriage <note place="margin">The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience of the mariage of Prieſts.</note> of Prieſts this inconuenience will follow, that hauing houſe, wife, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they will not depend on the Pope, but of their Prince, and their loue to their children will make them yeeld to any preiudice of the Church.

            <p>The Pope, principally for theſe cauſes, did reſolue negatiuely; and, to <note place="margin">The Popere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth not to grant the Cup to the French men.</note> make his reſolution the leſſe grieuous, he cauſed the Ambaſſadour to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to deſiſt of his owne accord, who not conſenting, hee cauſed him to be intreated, that, at the leaſt, hee would proſecute it gently, in regard it was impoſſible to yeeld vnto him, for feare of aliening all the Catholiques.

            <p>In conformity hereof, hee did recapitulate in Conſiſtory the inſtances, and cauſes, for which hee had, iuſt a yeere ſince, intimated the Councell, by aduice of them the Cardinals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the difficulties which hee encountred, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame, in perſwading the Princes, who were of contrary opinions to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Bull; his diligence in ſending preſently the Legates, and thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with whom hee was able to preuaile, either with perſwaſions; or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds, that all is already prepared by him onely, ſeuen moneths ſince, and is ſo chargeable to him, that, amongſt officers and poore Prelates, the Apoſtolique Sea doeth ſpend aboue three thouſand crownes a moneth, and that experience ſheweth that delay doeth bring on more expence, that the Dutch-men doe inuent ſome thing euery day, to oppoſe againſt this holy and neceſſary worke; that hereſies doe increaſe in <hi>France;</hi> and ſome Biſhops are almoſt become re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hee ſaid afterwards that the Synode was to continue ſtill, not to terminate in ſuſpenſions, or tranſlations, as formerly it did, with notorious preiudice and danger, but to haue an abſolute end. For effecting whereof, there was no neede to ſpend many moneths, in regard the moſt important points were already determined and the reſidue was ſo ſet in order, by diſputations and examinations vnder <hi>Iulius,</hi> that ſcarce any thing remained but publication; ſo that all would be diſpatched in a ſhorttime.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Nuncio,</hi> reſident in <hi>France,</hi> returned to <hi>Rome</hi> in the beginning of December; who hauing related the ſtate of that Kingdome, the Pope wrote <note place="margin">The Pope writeth to his Legate in <hi>France.</hi>

Beſides, he commanded the Legat to vſe all diligence to hinder the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſſembling of the Proteſtants, and to encourage the Diuines, giuing them <hi>Indulgences</hi> and ſpirituall <hi>graces,</hi> and promiſing them temporall aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance alſo, but that himſelfe ſhould, by no meanes, be preſent at the ſermons of the Proteſtants, and auoid all banquets where any of them were in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.</p>

Which was therather thought to be neceſſary, becauſe there was a fame that the French-men, though Catholiques, came with <hi>Sorbonicall</hi> and <hi>Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> mindes, fully bent to acknowledge the Pope no further then they pleaſed. And it was knowen before, that the Spaniards had ſome humour to ſubiect the Pope to the Councell; and the Legates had often ſent aduice from <hi>Trent,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The deſeignes of the French, and Spaniſh Prelates are ſuſpected.</note> that ſome bad ambitious humours, to enlarge the Epiſcopall authority, were diſcouered; and, in particular, the Spaniards did propoſe that it was neceſſary to reſtraine the authority of the Pope, at the leaſt ſo farre as that hee might not derogate from the decrees of this Councell, ſaying, that, otherwiſe, the labour and coſt would be all in vaine, if, for ſmall cauſes, and ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any, he might diſpence with them, as he dayly doth with all the Canons.

            <p>Therefore it was written to <hi>Trent,</hi> that they ſhould make large promiſes to the <hi>Polonians,</hi> but conclude, that the Councell was a continuation, and the ſame which was begun vnder <hi>Paulus</hi> the third, ſo that the orders then practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and continuately kept, with good fruit, as did appeare, muſt be ſtill ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued; amongſt which one was that the abſent ſhould haue no voyce, with which if they did diſpence, all other National would pretend the like, with much confuſion; that whatſoeuer requeſt <hi>Polonia</hi> did make, for any thing <note place="margin">The <hi>Polonian</hi> Prelats ſeeme to be ſatisfied with a courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous negatiue, but depart, &amp; returne no more.</note> that was proper to it ſelfe, and would not raiſe any ſtirres in other Countries, ſhould be granted in regard of the merits of that moſt noble Nation.

But the bad conceit which the Court had of the French-men was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, by an aduice ſent from <hi>Paris,</hi> that the Parliament had, with much ſolemoitie, condemned to recant one <hi>Iohn Tancherel,</hi> a Bachelor of Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:17208:242"/>
becauſe, with intelligence of ſome Diuines, he had propoſed and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded publique queſtions, that the Pope, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icar</hi> of CHRIST, is Monarch of the Church, and may depriue Kings and Princes, who diſobey his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, of their Kingdomes, States, and Digmties; who beeing accuſed, cited, and hauing confeſſed the fact, did flie, and the iudges, as in a Comedie, cauſed the Beadell of the Vniuerſitie to repreſent his perſon, and to make a publike ſatisfaction, and recantation, forbidding the Diuines to diſpute ſuch queſtions hereafter, making them goe to the King to aske pardon for hauing ſuffered ſo important a matter to bee diſputed on, and to promiſe to oppoſe themſelues alwayes againſt that doctrine. They ſpake of the Frenchmen as of loſt ſheepe, who denied the authoritie giuen by CHRIST to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">For which the French-men are much cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in <hi>Rome</hi>

The examples of the Emperours, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth and fifth, <hi>Frederic</hi> the firſt and ſecond, and <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> of the Kings of <hi>France, Philippus Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Pulcher,</hi> were alleadged; as alſo the famous ſayings of the Canoniſts in this poynt: they ſayd the Pope ought to cite the whole Parliament to <hi>Rome;</hi> and that the concluſion of that Diuine ought to be ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> alſo, to be examined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing elſe were done, and approoued, and the contrary condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The Pope did moderately complaine hereof, and thought it better <note place="margin">But the Pope diſſembleth his diſtaſte.</note> to diſſemble, becauſe, as hee ſayd, the great ſore of <hi>France</hi> did make this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible.</p>
            <p>The Court was perſwaded, that neither Ambaſſadour nor Biſhop would be ſent out of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Trent,</hi> and diſcourſed what was fit for the Pope to doe, to force them to accept the determinations of the Councell, which the Pope was, by all meanes, reſolued to open, at the beginning of the new yeere. Hee imparted this determination to the Cardinals, exhorting them to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it did not ſtand with the honour of the Apoſtolike Sea, nor of that Colledge, to receiue rules and reformations from others, and that the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the times, when all crie out for reformation, not vnderſtanding what <note place="margin">The Pope promiſeth to make a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in the Court.</note> it is, did require, that in regard of the glorious name thereof, it ſhould not bee refuſed; that, in this contrariety of reaſons, the beſt temper was, to make, by way of preuention, a reformation of his owne accord; which would not ſerue to that purpoſe onely, but win commendations alſo, by making himſelfe an example to others; that for this cauſe, hee would reforme the <hi>Penitentiary,</hi> and <hi>Datary,</hi> principall members of the Court, and afterwards conſider of ſmaller matters: and he deputed cardinals for one and the other charge. He diſcourſed of the cauſes why the opening of the Councell could <note place="margin">And haſtneth the opening of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> no longer be deferred. For it being diſcouered that the <hi>Vltramontans</hi> haue bad ends and diſſeignes, to abate the abſolute power which GOD hath giuen to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> the more time they haue to thinke on it, the more their plots will encreaſe; and that there is danger, that, by time, ſome of the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians may bee gained alſo; that therefore it is the ſafeſt way to vſe expedition, and that, if the great expences, which are made in maintaining the Prelats, be not quickly ended, the Apoſtolike Sea, will not bee able to beare them. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he gaue the croſſe of the Legation to the Card. <hi>Altemps,</hi> with order to

put himſelfe in readineſſe, and to bee in <hi>Trent</hi> at the opening of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, if it were poſſible. The cauſe why hee reuoked the order, giuen at the departure of Cardinall <hi>Simoneta,</hi> to open the Councell at his arriuall, was the inſtance of the Emperours Ambaſſador in <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Ambaſſadours of his Maſter might bee preſent at it. But afterward hauing aduertized his Holineſſe, that they would be in <hi>Trent</hi> before the midſt of Ianuary, hee ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreated the Marquis of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> had ſent Ambaſſadour to the Councell, to bee in <hi>Trent,</hi> and aſſiſt at the opening of it. Hee ſolicited the <hi>Venetians</hi> alſo to ſend their Ambaſſage, beeing care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that that ceremony ſhould paſſe with reputation. Notwithſtanding, he wrote to the Legats to open the Councell ſo ſoone as the Ambaſſadors of the Emperour, and of the forenamed Princes were arriued, and that if they came not by the middeſt of the moneth, they ſhould deferre it no longer.

The ſecond dated the three and twentieth of May, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates ſhould haue facultie to abſolue thoſe who would ſecretly abiure for cauſe of hereſies.

               </gap> any one might cauill, that it was a new Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. The Biſhop of <hi>Zante,</hi> who had been in <hi>Germany,</hi> and knew how that action would be calumniated and how diſtaſtfull to the Emperour, replied, that as the things already determined ought not to bee queſtioned, but held as decided, ſo to declare ſo much now without neceſſitie, would cut off all hope from the Emperour and French King to finde ſuch a coniuncture, as that the Proteſtants would ſubmit themſelues to the Councell, and aſſiſt in it. The Legats eſpecially <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Varmienſe,</hi> did ſecond the opinion of the Biſhop with many diſcourſes, and much was ſpoken on both ſides very bitterly, and the Spaniards ſayd they would proteſt and returne: yet, after many conſultations, they finally agreed to deſiſt from their inſtance, not to oppoſe the Emperour, the French King, the Dutchmen, and Frenchmen, nor to giue matter of complaint to the Proteſtants, ſo that no words were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſignifie it was a new Councell, or to preiudice the continuation. The Cardinals promiſed in the Popes name, that his Holineſſe would confirme whatſoeuer was done in <hi>Trent,</hi> in the two precedent Councels, though this were diſſolued without concluſion. The Spaniards were content: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long diſcourſing, it was concluded, that a forme of words ſhould be vſed <note place="margin">A decree for opening the Councell.</note> to ſignifie, that the Councell did begin to be celebrated, all ſuſpenſion being remoued; which though they were ambiguous, and might bee drawen to contrary ſences, yet being ſufficient to compoſe the preſent difference, they were receiued, and they concluded to open the Councell the next Sunday, being the eighteenth of the moneth. In the ende the Cardinall propoſed, that the Councell being begun, the Prelates ſhould frequent the publique Chappels in the time of Maſſe, and that there ſhould bee many Latine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which being to bee made ſometimes by men that know not what doth befit the time, place, and auditorie, that it were good to depute a Prelate, who, as Maſter of the holy Palace in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould reuiew that which was to bee <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Modena</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to peruſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is to be deliuered in publique.</note> ſpoken, and ſo the Sermon to bee repeated, according to his cenſure. The propoſition pleaſed them all; and <hi>Egidius Foſcararus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Modena,</hi> was appointed to peruſe euery Sermon, and whatſoeuer elſe was to bee deliuered in publique.</p>
            <p>The Congregation beeing diſſolued, the Legates, by the helpe of their inward friends, beganne to frame the Decree, and did conceiue it in the forme agreed on; and obſeruing diuers treaties amongſt the Prelates, while they were idle in <hi>Trent</hi> to propoſe ſome one prouiſion, ſome another, all
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:17208:244"/>
tending to enlarge the authority of the Biſhops, and diminiſh that of <hi>Rome,</hi> they thought to remedie all in the beginning, before the humour began to ſtirre, by decreeing that none, but the Legats, might propoſe any matter to bee diſcuſſed. They ſaw the propoſition was hard, and foreſaw contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore they thought it neceſſary to vſe much Art, that it might bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſweetely, and at vnawards. The negatiue, that none ſhould propound, <note place="margin">Why the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats deſire to make a decree that none ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any thing in Councell, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> ſeemed hard and ſharpe; and the affirmatiue, that the Legats ſhould propound, which did virtually onely, and not plainely containe an excluſion of others, did pleaſe better, couering all with a pretence of keeping order, and giuing time of deliberation to the Synode. The Decree was ſo artificially made, that, euen at this preſent, one muſt be very attentiue, if hee will diſcouer the ſenſe, and it is impoſſible to vnderſtand it at the firſt; which I will rehearſe in vulgar, in plaine tearmes; but hee that will ſee the Artifice, let him reade it in Latine.</p>
            <p>Therefore in conformitie of the reſolution, when the eighteenth day was <note place="margin">The ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the firſt Seſſion, in which the Councell was opened.</note> come, a proceſſion was made of the whole Clergie of the Citie, of the Diuines and Prelates, who, beſides the Cardinals, were one hundred and twelue, that did weare <hi>Miter,</hi> accompanied by their families, and by many Countrey people armed going from Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church, to the Cathedrall; where the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſang the Maſſe of the holy Ghoſt, and <hi>Gaspar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> del Foſſo,</hi> Arch biſhop of <hi>Rheggio,</hi> made the Sermon. His ſubiect was the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Church, Primacie of the Pope, and the power of Councels. He ſaid that the Church had as much authoritie as the word of God; that the Church hath changed the Sabbath, ordained by God, into Sunday, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away Circumciſion, formerly commanded by his Diuine Maieſtie, and that theſe Precepts are changed, not by the preaching of CHRIST; but by the authoritie of the Church. Turning himſelfe to the Fathers, hee exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to labour conſtantly againſt the Proteſtants, being aſſured that, as the holy Ghoſt cannot erre, ſo they cannot bee deceiued.

They anſwered, <hi>Placet.</hi> Onely foure prelats contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted that part, <hi>Proponentibus Legatis:</hi> which wordes I repeate in Latine, <note place="margin">The words, <hi>Proponenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Legatis,</hi> were much queſtioned.</note> becauſe they muſt bee often mentioned, in regard of the great controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and diſputes which followed. The contradictors were <hi>Peter Guerrero,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Granata, Franceſco Bianco,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orenſe, Andreas della Queſta,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Leon, Antonio Colermero,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Almeria.</hi> They ſaid they could not conſent, becauſe they were new wordes, neuer vſed in any Councell, and demanded that their voyces might bee regiſtred in the actes of the Councell. No anſwere was giuen them, and the next Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was intimated for the ſixe and twentieth of February. The Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Councell required all the <hi>Notaries</hi> and <hi>Protonotaries</hi> to make
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:17208:245"/>
one or more Inſtruments of the things aforeſayd; and ſo the Seſſion ended.</p>
            <p>The Legates aduiſed the Pope of what happened in the Congregation, and Seſſion, who imparted it to the Conſiſtory. In which many were of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, in regard of theſe firſt difficulties, that the Councell would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed well, eſpecially conſidering the obſtinate contradiction of the Spaniſh Biſhops not fit to compoſe the differences of Religion, although the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates and Biſhops of <hi>Italie</hi> ſhould vſe Arte, and vnitie in temporizing and ouercomming them. The Pope commended the wiſedome of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, that they had preuented, as hee ſayd, there meritie of the innouators; and was not diſpleaſed with the oppoſition of foure, becauſe hee feared a greater number; hee exhorted the Cardinals to reforme themſelues, ſeeing they had to doe with vnreſpectfull perſons, giuing order that the other Italian Biſhops ſhould bee ſolicited to depart. And hee wrote to <hi>Trent</hi> that they <note place="margin">Which the Pope wil haue to be maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by all meanes.</note> ſhould maintaine the Decree firmely, and put it in execution, without relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one iote.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France</hi> the Queene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> Admirall, and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe <note place="margin">Tumults in <hi>France</hi> about Religion.</note> of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> hauing many moneths made requeſt that places ſhould be allowed to thoſe of the new Religion, for the Sermons and Ceremonies, and all theſe, and many Grandies more, euen in the Court it ſelfe, making profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof, the inferiour Reformatiſts, imboldened hereby, did aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelues apart, which the Catholiques not being able to ſupport, very dangerous popular tumults were raiſed in many parts of the Kingdome, with ſlaughter on both ſides; which were cheriſhed by the Nobilitie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, enuying that the Hugonot Princes, gayning a popular trayne, ſhould exceede them. Two diuers tumults were rayſed by Sermons; one in <hi>Dijon,</hi> and the other in <hi>Paris;</hi> notorious not onely for the death of many, but alſo for the rebellion againſt the Magiſtrates; which made the Kings Counſell reſolue to ſeeke a remedy; and, that it might bee fitted to the whole Kingdome, the Preſidents of all the Parliaments were called, and a number of Counſellors elected to deliberate with maturity what was beſt to be done. The ſeuenteenth of Ianuary, all theſe being aſſembled in Saint <hi>German,</hi> the Chancellor declared in the Kings name, that they were called to conſult how to remedie the ſtirres raiſed in the Kingdome. Hee made a recapitulation of all the things that hapned, adding that the differences of Religion ſhould be referred to the Prelates, but when the peace of the Kingdome, and keeping of the Subiects in obedience to the King is in queſtion, that this could not belong to the Eccleſiaſtiques, but to thoſe whom the King would appoint to conſult of it. That he had euer commended <hi>Tulli,</hi> who was wont to blame <hi>Cato,</hi> that, liuing in a moſt corrupt age, was ſo ſeuere and rigid in his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, as if hee had been a Senator in <hi>Plato</hi> his Common-wealth. That lawes were to bee fitted to the time and perſons, as the ſhooe to the foote. That this particular was then to bee conſulted of, whether it were good ſeruice for the King to permit or prohibite the Congregations of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; wherein they were not to diſpute which Religion was the better, becauſe they tooke not in hand to frame a Religion, but to put in order a Republique; and that it was not abſurd to ſay, that many might bee good
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:17208:245"/>
Citizens, and not good Chriſtians, and that thoſe who were of diuers religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might liue in peace.</p>
            <p>In conſulting hereof the opinions were diuers: but they preuailed who thought that the Edict of Iuly was to bee remitted in part, and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to haue leaue to preach. At the making of the Edict, which contained many points, the Cardinals of <hi>Borbon, Tornon, Chaſtillon</hi> were preſent, as alſo the Biſhops of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and <hi>Valence.</hi> That the Proteſtants ſhould reſtore the Churches poſſeſſions, and other Eccleſiaſticall goods vſurped. That they ſhould forbeare to beate downe Croſſes, Images, and Churches, vpon paine of death. That they ſhould not aſſemble themſelues to preach, pray, or adminiſter the Sacraments, in publique or in priuate, by day or by night, within the Citie. That the prohibitions, and puniſhments of the Edict of Iuly, and all others made before ſhould bee ſuſpended. That they ſhall not be moleſted in their Sermons made out of the Citie, or hindred by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, who ought to protect them from iniurie, chaſtiſing the Seditions on both ſides. That none ſhall ſcandalize another for Religion, or vſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious words of faction. That the Magiſtrates and officers may bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Sermons and Congregations. That they ſhall not make Synods, <hi>Colloquies,</hi> or Conſiſtories, but with leaue, and in preſence of the Magiſtrate. That they ſhall obſerue the lawes for feaſts, and degrees prohibited for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. That the Miniſters ſhall bee bound to ſweare to the publique Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, not to offend againſt this Edict, nor to preach any doctrine contrary to the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell, and the bookes of the New and Old Teſtament. The Parliament could hardly be brought to accept of this Edict. Therefore the King did commaund againe, that it ſhould bee publiſhed, adding that it was to be vnderſtood to bee made by way of prouiſion, vntill the determinations of the Generall Councell were diuulged, or the King ordaine otherwiſe, not meaning to allow two Religions in his Kingdome, but that onely of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mother the Church, in which himſelfe and his predeceſſours haue liued. The Parliament beeing not agreed for all this, the King commaunded, that, laying aſide all delayes and difficulties, the ordination ſhould bee publiſhed. And ſo it was the ſixth of March, with this clauſe, that the Parliament did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie <note place="margin">For appeaſing of which an Edict is made, March 6.</note> the Kings letters to obey him, conſidering the ſtate of the times, not to approoue the new Religion, but onely by way of prouiſion, vntill it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ordained by the King.</p>
            <p>But to returne to <hi>Trent</hi> in the Congregation held the ſeuen and twentieth <note place="margin">Three propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the 27. of Ianuary.</note> of Ianuary the Legates made three propoſitions. The firſt, to examine the bookes written by diuers authors, ſince the hereſies began, together with the cenſures of the Catholiques againſt them, to determine what the Synode ſhould decree concerning them. The ſecond, that all that are intereſted in that matter, ſhould bee cited by Decree of the Synode, leſt they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that they haue not beene heard. The third, that a Safe Conduct ſhould be giuen to thoſe who are fallen into hereſie, with a large promiſe of great and ſingular clemencie, ſo that they will repent, and acknowledge the power of the Catholique Church. And order was giuen that the Fathers, hauing conſidered on the propoſitions, ſhould deliuer their opinions in the next Congregation, as well how to examine with caſe the bookes and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:17208:246"/>
as concerning all the reſt. And Prelates were deputed to examine the <hi>Mandates</hi> and excuſes of thoſe who pretended they could not come to the Councell.</p>
            <p>This place doth require a relation of the beginning of prohibiting bookes, and with what progreſſe it was come to that ſtate in which it then was, and what new order was then taken. In the Church of Martyrs there was no Eccleſiaſticall prohibition, though ſome godly men made conſcience of <note place="margin">A diſcourſe of the Author concerning the prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of bookes.</note> reading bad bookes, for feare of offending againſt one of the three poynts of the Law of God, to auoyd the contagion of euill; not to expoſe ones ſelfe to temptation, without neceſſitie or profite; and not to ſpend time vainely. Theſe Lawes, beeing naturall, doe remaine alwayes, and ſhould oblige vs to beware of reading bad bookes, though there were no Eccleſiaſticall law for it. But theſe reſpects ceaſing, the example of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a famous Doctor, did happen, who about the yeere of our Lord 240. being reprehended by his Prieſts for theſe cauſes, and troubled with theſe reſpects, had a viſion that hee ſhould reade all bookes, becauſe hee was able to iudge of them. Yet they thought there was greater danger in the bookes of the Gentiles, then of the heretiques, the reading whereof was more abhorred and reprehended, becauſe it was more vſed by Chriſtian Doctors for a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of learning eloquence. For this cauſe S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> either in a viſion, or in a ſleepe, was beaten by the Deuill; ſo that about the yeere 400. a Councel in <hi>Carthage</hi> did forbid to reade the bookes of the Gentiles, but allowed them to reade the bookes of the heretiques; the Decree whereof is amongſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons collected by <hi>Gratian.</hi> And this was the firſt prohibition by way of Canon: but there are others, by counſell of the Fathers, to bee regulated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law of God, before recited. The bookes of heretiques, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining doctrine condemned by Councels, were often forbid by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours for good gouernment. So <hi>Conſtantine</hi> forbad the bookes of <hi>Arrius; Arcadius</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Eunomians,</hi> and <hi>Maniches; Theodoſius</hi> thoſe of <hi>Neſtorius; Martianus</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Euticheans;</hi> and in <hi>Spaine</hi> the King <hi>Ricaredus,</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Arrians.</hi> It ſufficed the Councels and Biſhops to ſhew what bookes did containe damned or apocryphall doctrine. So did <hi>Gelaſius</hi> in the yeere 494. and went no further, leauing it to the conſcience of euery one to auoyde them, or reade them to a good end. After the yeere 800. the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> as they aſſumed a great part of the politique gouernment, ſo they cauſed the bookes, whoſe authors they did condemne, to bee burned, and forbad the reading of them. Notwithſtanding, one ſhall finde but few bookes forbid in that ſort, vntill this age. A generall prohibition of reading bookes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining doctrine of heretiques, or ſuſpected of hereſies, vpon paine of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, without any further ſentence, was not vſed. <hi>Martinus</hi> 5. doth in a Bull excommunicate all the Sects of heretiques, eſpecially <hi>Wigleſiſts,</hi> and <hi>Huſsites,</hi> not mentioning thoſe who read their bookes, though many of them went about. <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth condemning <hi>Luther,</hi> did withall forbid all his bookes, vpon paine of excommunication. The Popes following, in the Bull called <hi>In oena,</hi> hauing condemned and excommunicated all heretiques, did excommunicate thoſe alſo who reade their bookes: and, in other Buls againſt heretiques in generall, did thunder the ſame cenſures, againſt the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:17208:246"/>
of their bookes. This did rather breed a confuſion. For the heretiques not beeing condemned by name, one was to iudge of the bookes more by the quality of the doctrine, then by the name of the authors, wherein diuers men beeing of diuers opinions, many ſcruples of conſcience did ariſe. The <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> being more diligent, made Catalogues of thoſe whom they knew, which, not being conferred, were not ſufficient to remooue the difficultie. <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> was the firſt that gaue a more conuenient forme, in the yeere 1558, making a Law that the Catalogue of bookes prohibited by <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> ſhould be printed.</p>
            <p>According to this example <hi>Paul</hi> 4. alſo ordained, that an <hi>Index</hi> ſhould be compoſed by that office, and printed; and ſo it was in the yeere 1559. in which they did proceede many ſteps further then formerly they had done, and layd foundations to maintaine and make great the authority of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by depriuing men of that knowledge, which is neceſſary to defend them from vſurpations. Vntill that time they contained themſelues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the tearmes of the bookes of the heretiques, neither was there any booke forbidden, if the author were not condemned. This <hi>Index</hi> was diuided into three parts. The firſt conteineth the names of thoſe, all whoſe workes, of what argument ſoeuer, though prophane, are forbidden: and in this number are placed not onely thoſe who haue profeſſed doctrine, contrary to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> but many alſo which liued and dyed in the profeſſion therof. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond conteineth the names of the bookes which are particularly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, others of the ſame authours not beeing condemned. In the third, ſome bookes are condemned without a name, but onely by a generall rule, that all thoſe are forbidden which beare not the names of the authors, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten after the yeere 1519, and many Authours and bookes are condemned which for 300. 200. and 100. yeeres haue beene commonly read by the learned in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the knowledge, and without the contradiction of the Popes of thoſe times; and, amongſt the modernes, ſome of thoſe which were printed in <hi>Italy,</hi> euen in <hi>Rome,</hi> with approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and allowed alſo by the Briefes of the Pope himſelfe, are forbidden; as the Annotations of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> vpon the New Teſtament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth hauing read, approued by his Briefe, dated in <hi>Rome,</hi> Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember <note place="margin">The annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> vpon the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, read &amp; approued by <hi>Leo</hi> 10. are, forbidden to be read.</note> 10. 1518. But it is a thing conſiderable aboue all, that vnder colour of faith and religion, bookes are prohibited and condemned, with the ſame ſeuerity, in which the authority of Princes and Temporall Magiſtrates is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from they ſurpations of the Clergie; and of Councels and Biſhops, from the vſurpations of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> in which hypocriſies or tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are manifeſted, by which the people, vnder pretence of Religion, are deceiued. In ſumme, a better myſtery was neuer found, then to vſe religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make men inſenſible. That <hi>Inquiſition</hi> went ſo ſarre, that it made a Catalogue of 62. Printers, and prohibited all bookes printed by them, of what authour, art, or <hi>idiome</hi> ſoeuer; with an addition of more weight; that is, and bookes printed by ſuch Printers who haue printed bookes of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques; ſo that there ſcarce remained a booke to bee read. And for the height of rigour, the prohibition of what booke ſoeuer contained in that Catalogue, was vpon paine of excommunication <hi>

                  </gap> ſententiae,</hi> reſerued to
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:17208:247"/>
the Pope, depriuation and incapacitie of offices and benefices, perpetuall infamie, and other arbitrary puniſhments. Concerning this ſeueritie, remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance was made to this Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> who referred the <hi>Index</hi> and all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Councell, as hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>Touching the Articles propoſed there were diuers opinions. <hi>Ludouicus Becatelli,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Raguſi,</hi> and Friar <hi>Auguſtin Seluago,</hi> Archbiſhop of <note place="margin">The opinion of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſi,</hi> and of <hi>Genua,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Index.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Genua,</hi> thought that no good effect could proceed from handling the matter of bookes in Counſell, yea, that it would rather hinder the concluſion of that for which the Councel is principally aſſembled. For <hi>Paul</hi> 4. by the counſell of all the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> and of many famous men, who ſent him aduice from all parts, made a moſt compleat catalogue, to which nothing can bee added, except ſome booke come foorth within theſe two yeeres, which deſerueth not the labour of a Synod. But hee that would allow any that are prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that collection, would ſhew that they haue vnaduiſedly proceeded in <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo would take away all reputation from the <hi>Index</hi> already publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and from the Decree it ſelfe which they would make; it beeing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>maxime,</hi> that new lawes doe remooue eſtimation more from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, then from the old. Beſides (ſaid <hi>Becatelli)</hi> there is no need of bookes, the world hath too many already, eſpecially ſince printing was inuented: and it is better to forbid a thouſand bookes without cauſe, then permit one that deſerueth prohibition. Neither were it fit the Synod ſhould be troubled with rendring the cauſes of the prohibitions, making cenſures, or approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thoſe which are already made in diuers places by the Catholiques. For it would bee to call for contradiction. It belongeth to a Doctor to giue a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his ſaying, a law-maker if he doe it, doth diminiſh his authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſubject doth wreſtle with the reaſon alleadged, and when hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth he hath reſolued it, hee thinketh alſo that hee hath taken all vertue from the precept. Neither is it good to correct or purge any booke for the ſame cauſes, for feare of making men ſay that ſomething is omitted that deſerued, and ſomething changed that did not deſerue correction. Moreouer the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod would incurre the diſpleaſure of all that are affectionate to the bookes prohibited, and would induce them not to receiue the other neceſſary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, which ſhall bee made. Hee concluded, that, the <hi>Index</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> being ſufficient, he thought it not fit to take paines in vaine in doing of that anew, which is done already, or vndoing that which is done well. Many other reaſons were alleadged in confirmation of this opionion, by many Biſhops creatures of <hi>Paul</hi> 4, admirers of his wiſedome in managing the Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, who maintained that it was neceſſary to preſerue, yea, to augment the rigour inſtituted by him, if they would preſerue the purity of religion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Thomaſo S. Felicio,</hi> was of a contrary opinion; that the Councell ſhould treate againe of bookes; as if there had been no precedent prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The opinion of</hi> Iohn Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſo S. Felicio</note> becauſe that, beeing made by the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> is odious, for the name, to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltramontans,</hi> and beſides is ſo rigid that it cannot bee obſerued; and nothing doth more eaſily bring a law into diſuſe, then the impoſſibilitie or great difficulty in keeping it, and the great rigour in puniſhing the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours; he ſayd that, indeed, it was neceſſary to preſerue the reputation of that office, but that might bee done conueniently enough, by making no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:17208:247"/>
thereof, and by ordayning onely things neceſſary, and moderate puniſhments. And therefore his opinion was, that all conſiſted in ſetting downe the manner, and ſpake what himſelfe thought to be the beſt; that is, that the bookes not already cenſured ſhould be diuided amongſt the Fathers and Diuines of the Counſel, and thoſe that were abſent alſo, to bee examined and cenſured, and that a great Congregation ſhould be deputed, to iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the cenſure and the booke; and that this alſo ſhould bee obſerued in thoſe which are cenſured already, and then all ſhould be propoſed in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Congregation, to decree that which was beſt for the publike good. For citing the Authors, hee ſaid there were two ſorts of them; ſome ſeparated from the Church, and ſome incorporated in it, of the former no account is to be made, ſeeing that, by their ſeparation, they haue, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned themſelues, and their owne workes, ſo that there is no cauſe to heare them; of the others ſome are dead, and ſome aliue; of which the latter are to be cited and heard, becauſe their good name and honour being in queſtion one cannot proceed againſt they workes, before the hearing of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Concerning the dead, whatſoeuer the publike good doth require may be done, without danger of offending any. Another Biſhop added to this opinion, that the ſame forme of iuſtice, vſed towards the Catholiques aliue, ſhould be vſed alſo towards thoſe that are dead, becauſe they haue kinred and ſchollars, who doe participate of the fame of infamie of the dead, and are therefore intereſted, and in caſe there were none ſuch, yet the onely memory of the dead cannot be iudged, before it be defended.</p>
            <p>Some alſo did thinke it was not iuſt to condemne the workes of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, without hearing them. For howſoeuer the perſons be condemned by themſelues, yet the lawes doe not permit the declaratory, without citation, though in a notorious fact; and therefore it cannot be pronounced againſt a booke, though it doth notoriouſly containe hereſie. Fryar <hi>Gregory,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the <hi>Heremites,</hi> ſayd, he did not thinke it neceſſary to obſerue ſo many ſubtilties. For the prohibition of a booke, is as the prohibition of a meate, which is not a ſentence againſt it, nor againſt him that hath prepared it, but a precept to him that is to vſe it, made by him who hath the charge of his health; therefore the credit of the Victualer is not in queſtion, but the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the ſicke, who is forbid to eate of a meat that is hurtfull to him, though in it ſelfe, it may be good. So the Synod, as a Phyſician, ought to forbid that which is hurtfull, or dangerous to the faithfull; wherein none will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue wrong. For howſoeuer the booke may bee good in it ſelfe, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture it may not agree to the infirmity of the mindes of this age. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other conſiderations did paſſe, which were finally reſolued into one of theſe.</p>
            <p>Concerning the third Article, to inuite the heretickes to repentance with <note place="margin">The Legats and Prelats are diuided concerning the generall ſafe conduct.</note> promiſe of clemencie, and grant of a ſafe conduct, there were diuers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, euen amongſt the Legates themſelues. <hi>Mantua</hi> was for a generall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſaying, that many would bee gained thereby, and that it was a remedie vſed by all Princes, in ſeditions, or rebellions, to pardon thoſe whom they cannot ouercome, becauſe, by that meanes, thoſe that are leaſt faultie, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and the others remaine more weake; and although but few were gained,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:17208:248"/>
or but one onely, yet it was to bee done; that though none at all could bee gained, yet it would be great gaine to vſe and ſhew clemencie. <hi>Simoneta</hi> ſaid, that this would be dangerous for the ruine of others, becauſe many are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to tranſgreſſe, when they ſee it is eaſie to get a pardon, and that rigour, though it be hard to him that feeleth it, doth keepe many in their duety; that it is ſufficient to ſhew clemencie to him that deſireth it, but to carrie it after him that doeth not demaund; or doeth refuſe it, doth make men more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of themſelues; and hereſie will be thought to bee but a ſmall fault, when men ſee it is ſo eaſily pardoned. In theſe two opinions the Prelates were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided; and thoſe who did not approoue the Safe Conduct, ſaid, it was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to any in the firſt Conuocation of this Councell, which would haue been done if it had beene neceſſary or conuenient, becauſe the Pope that ſate then was moſt wiſe, and the Legats the chiefeſt of the Colledge; that it was giuen in the ſecond Conuocation, becauſe <hi>Maurice</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> and other Proteſtants did deſire it, and the Emperour alſo in their behalfe: but now it beeing demaunded by none, <hi>Germanie</hi> ſaying aloud, and proteſting that it doth not hold this Councell to be lawfull, a Safe Conduct would but giue them matter, to make ſome bad expoſition of the Synods meaning. The Spaniſh Prelats would by no meanes conſent to a generall Safe Conduct, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would preiudice the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in regard, ſo long as that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, euery one might profeſſe himſelfe to bee a Proteſtant, and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ready for the voyage, and could not be arreſted by that office. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates thought the like might happen to the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> All <note place="margin">The reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation concerning the <hi>Index,</hi> and Safe Conduct</note> being conſidered, concerning the <hi>Index,</hi> it ſeemed ſufficient for that preſent, to make Deputies, and to let thoſe that were intereſted vnderſtand, by ſome little part of the Decree, that they ſhould be heard, and inuite all to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; and, for the Safe Conduct, to referre themſelues, in regard of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to a further conſideration.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were handled, the Popes Nephew, Cardinall <hi>Altemps,</hi> the fift Legate, came to <hi>Trent,</hi> and withall the newes of the Edict of <hi>France</hi> before rehearſed: which put them all into a confuſion, that Princes ſhould permit, by publique Decree, thoſe nouities which the Councell was then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled to condemne.

The Archbiſhop made a long Oration, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the reſidue to Maſter <hi>Sigiſmond Tonn,</hi> his Maieſties ſecond Ambaſſador, who was to come. The Synode anſwered, that they were very glad to ſee the Emperours Ambaſſadours, and that they did admit his <hi>Mandate.</hi> The Ambaſſadour would haue preceded the Cardinall <hi>Madruccio,</hi> alleadging the reaſons and pretenſions of <hi>Don Diego,</hi> in the firſt Councell; but by the Legats anſwere, who told him how that buſineſſe was ended, he was ſatisfied, and ſate belowe.</p>
            <p>The ninth of this moneth <hi>Ferdinandus Martinez Maſcarenius,</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of <hi>Portugall,</hi> was receiued, and the Kings letter of credence and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat</hi>

<pb n="477" facs="tcp:17208:248"/>
of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> hath now ouercome them. Hee ſaid the authoritie of Councels was ſo great, that their Decrees were to bee receiued, as diuine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; that the King hoped that the differences of Religion ſhould bee deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that Councel, and the manners of the Clergie directed to Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſinceritie; that therefore he promiſed all obedience, whereof the Biſhops arriued alreadie, and thoſe who were to come, could giue teſtimonie; hee ſhewed the pietie and religion of thoſe Kings, and the paines they haue taken to ſubiect ſo many Prouinces to the gouernment of the Apoſtolique Sea; of which heroically pious workes they might expect an imitation in King <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian.</hi> Hee ſet forth, in few words, the Nobilitie, and vertue of the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, and finally prayed the Fathers to heare him, when hee ſhould ſpeake in the behalfe of the Churches of that kingdome. The <hi>Speaker</hi> briefely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that the Synod was well pleaſed with the Kings <hi>Mandate,</hi> and his Oration, and that the piety and Religion of his Maieſty and of his Anceſtors was generally knowen, and their glorie conſpicuous, for maintaining the Catholike Religion in that kingdome in theſe turbulent times, and ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it in places farre remote: for which the Synod did giue thankes to GOD, and receiue the Kings <hi>Mandate</hi> with due reſpect.</p>
            <p>In the congregation of the eleuenth, the other Ambaſſador of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſecond Ambaſſador is receiued in Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> preſented himſelfe: who was receiued without much ceremonie, becauſe the <hi>Mandate</hi> had bin read before, ſo that there was time to treat of Conciliarie matters; whereof ſome thing being ſpoken, libertie was giuen to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats to elect Fathers to conſider of the <hi>Index,</hi> and others to frame the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, againſt the next Seſſion. For the buſineſſe of the Books, Cenſures, and <hi>Index,</hi> the Legats named the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> the Patriarke of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> foure Arch-biſhops, nine Biſhops, one Abbat, and two Generals.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth the Emperours Embaſſadours came to the Legats, and <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours make fiue requeſts to the Legats.</note> made fiue requeſts; which they left in writing, that they might conſider on them.

That the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioniſts ſhould not bee exaſperated in the beginning, by condemning their bookes. That a large ſafe conduct ſhould be giuen to the Proteſtants. That whatſoeuer was handled in the congregations, ſhould bee concealed, which hitherto had beene diuulged, euen to the common people. And hauing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered all fauour and aſſiſtance in the Emperours name, they added, that they had order from his Maieſtie, that if they were called by their moſt Reuerend Lordſhips, they ſhould giue their aduice in matters of the Councell, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his authoritie to fauour them.</p>
            <p>The Legats anſwered the ſeuenteenth day, that it being neceſſary to giue <note place="margin">To whom the Legats anſwere.</note> ſatisfaction to all, as they would not name the <hi>Continuation</hi> at their requeſt, ſo, not to prouoke the Spaniards, it was neceſſarie to abſtaine from the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that they would ſpend the next Seſſion in generall and light matters, and allow a long time for others; that they would not then condemne the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustan Confeſsion;</hi> that they would not then ſpeake of the bookes of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsionists,</hi> but would make the <hi>Index</hi> in the end of the Councell; that a large ſafe-conduct ſhould be giuen to the Germans, when it was decided whether
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:17208:249"/>
it ſhould be giuen to them apart, or together with other Nations; that they would take a good courſe for ſecrecie, and impart vnto them whatſoeuer they ſhall handle, being aſſured of the Emperors good affection and that the Ambaſſadours are correſpondent to the pietie and Religion of their Maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George Droſcouitius,</hi> Biſhop of the fiue Churches, the Emperours third Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, who came to <hi>Trent</hi> the moneth before, preſented his <hi>Mandate</hi> in <note place="margin">The Biſhop of fiue Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours third Ambaſſadour is receiued in congregation.</note> the generall Congregation, the foure and twentieth of February, and made an Oration, in which hee enlarged himſelfe in the praiſes of the Emperour, ſaying, that God had giuen him to theſe times, to prouide againſt ſo many miſeries; hee compared him to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in fauouring the Church; ſhewed what paines he had taken for the conuocation of the Councell, and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing obtained it, he had before all other Princes ſent Ambaſſadours, two for the Empire, kingdome of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and himſelfe for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Hungarie.</hi> Hee preſented his <hi>Mandate,</hi> and thanked the Synode for giuing him place, fitting the qualitie of an Ambaſſadour, before they ſaw the purpoſe of his ambaſſage. The Decree was made in generall tearmes, and read, as well to ſatisfie the Imperialiſts, as becauſe the matter was not well digeſted.</p>
            <p>Which being done, <hi>Mantua</hi> gaue a modeſt and graue admonition to the Fathers, to keepe ſecret what was handled in the Congregations, as well to auoyd oppoſition, as becauſe things are held in greater reputation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence when they are not knowen to all. Beſides, that it would be diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for that aſſembly, if any thing were publiſhed, (as might happen often) without conuenient circumſpection, and fit ſeemelineſſe. Hee added that there was no Colledge or Councell, Secular or Eccleſiaſticall, ſmall or great, which had not its ſecrets, to bee obſerued by oath, or vpon penalties: but that Synode, conſiſting of wiſe men, ought not to bee tyed but by the bonds of their owne iudgement; that, in ſaying thus, hee ſpake no more to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then to his colleagues, and to himſelfe, euery one being obliged to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh himſelfe in euery thing that is ſeemely. Then hee ſpake of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of the Safe conduct, and exhorted euery one to thinke exactly of it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if it could not bee determined before the Seſſion, an addition ſhould bee made to the Decree, that it might be granted in Congregation. This was agreed on amongſt the Legats, becauſe hauing diſcouered the difficulty, eſpecially in regard of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> they had written whatſoeuer had been ſpoken as well concerning this point, as the <hi>Index,</hi> and expected an anſwere from <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where the Pope was in a rage for the Edict of <hi>France,</hi> and impatient be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did nothing in the Councell. Hee ſaid it was not good that the Biſhops ſhould bee long out of their reſidencie, eſpecially to handle ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially points already decided in other Councels; hee had formerly ſuſpected the Spaniſh Prelats, and did it then much more, becauſe he thought their ill affection was increaſed, for giuing the King leaue to ſell foure hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crownes of yeerely rent of the Eccleſiaſticall reuenues for tenne yeeres, and thirty thouſand crownes of the reuenues of lands held in vaſſalage of the Church: which ſeemed to be a great diminution of the greatneſſe of the Church of <hi>Spaine.</hi>

Hee related what had happened in <hi>France</hi> ſince the death of <hi>Francis,</hi> and the <note place="margin">An Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour is ſent out of <hi>France</hi> to giue the Pope an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſtate of the kingdome.</note> neceſſitie to proceede with moderation, as well becauſe their forces were not ſufficient to vſe rigour, as alſo becauſe (if they had beene) they ſhould haue embrewed themſelues in the blood of the greateſt of the Nobility; which would haue aliened the whole Kingdome, and brought all matters to a worſe eſtate; and that the King had no hope but in the Councell, in which all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, euen the Germans themſelues, would aſſiſt. For Religion being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in <hi>Germany,</hi> he did not doubt to doe the like in <hi>France,</hi> but thought it impoſſible to make thoſe who will not be preſent in the Councell, to accept the Decrees therof; and that the French Proteſtants cannot be ſeparated from the Dutch. Therefore hee entreated his Holineſſe, that, to giue them ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, only for the ſecurity of the place and forme of proceeding, he would be pleaſed to yeeld vnto them, in regard of the great benefite which would enſue.

But, for the things done in <hi>France,</hi> he brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſayd hee could not commend them, and prayed God to pardon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of ſo great inconueniences.</p>
            <p>And the Pope would haue paſſed thoſe bounds, if hee had knowne what was in doing in <hi>France</hi> at that ſame time, when <hi>Lanſac</hi> made relation vnto him of what had beene done.

That it ſhould bee abſolutely forbidden to make an image of the holy Trinity, or of any perſon not named in the Martyrologies, accepted by the Church.

               <hi>Synod, lawfully aſſembled in</hi> CHRIST, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Granata</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that theſe words <hi>(repreſenting the vniuerſall Church)</hi> ſhould bee added, as hath beene obſerued in all the later Councels. <hi>Antonius Peragues,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Caglieri,</hi> made the ſame requeſt; and theſe two were followed by almoſt all the Spaniſh Prelates, deſiring that this requeſt might bee noted in the acts. No anſwere was made, but, for concluſion, the next Seſſion was appointed to be the 14 of May.</p>
            <p>The Decree was printed, not onely becauſe it was the cuſtome, but becauſe <note place="margin">The Decree is cenſured.</note> it was made of purpoſe to bee publiſhed to all; and it was cenſured by all ſorts of perſons. It was demanded how the Synod did call thoſe, who were intereſted in the things which were to bee handled in the Councell, if they were not knowne; and ſaid that formerly all things were handled beſides expectation, and who could propheſie what the Legates would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, becauſe they knew not themſelues, ſtill expecting Commiſſions from <hi>Rome.</hi> Thoſe who were intereſted in any booke, how could they know that any thing would be ſpoken againſt it? The generalitie of the citation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie of the cauſe might induce euery one to goe to <hi>Trent,</hi> becauſe euery one hath intereſt in ſome particular, which might perhaps bee treated on. It was concluded generally that they were called in ſhew, and excluded indeed. Notwithſtanding, theſe things which they could not praiſe, they commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ingenuous confeſsion of the Synod, that the former prohibitions had begot ſcruples in mens minds, and giuen cauſe of complaints. In <hi>Germanie</hi> that part was ſuſpected, where the Synod giueth authoritie to itſelfe, to giue a ſafe conduct in a generall Congregation. For they vnderſtood not any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, in regard the ſame perſons met in both aſſemblies, but only that they did weare <hi>Miters</hi> in the Seſſions, and <hi>Caps</hi> in the Congregations; nor why, if the ſafe-conduct could not then be granted, they could not make a Seſſion expreſly for it. In ſumme, they thought that there was ſome great myſterie couered in it, howſoeuer the moſt vnderſtanding men did beleeue that the Synod was aſſured that no Proteſtant would come to <hi>Trent,</hi> with any ſafe-conduct whatſoeuer, except it were by force, as it happened in the yeere 1552. becauſe of the reſolution of <hi>Charles,</hi> a thing which could no more bee put in practiſe.</p>

The Pope wrote backe to the Legats, that the heretikes ſhould not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited to repentance with promiſe of pardon; becauſe, it hauing been done by <hi>Iulius,</hi> and, another time, by <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, no good iſſue came of it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the heretiques, thoſe who are in a place of liberty will not accept it. and thoſe who remaine where the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> hath power, if they feare to bee diſcouered, will receiue the pardon fainedly to ſecure themſelues of that <note place="margin">The Popes anſwer to the Legats.</note> which is paſt, with purpoſe to doe worſe more warily. For the Safe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, hee was content it ſhould bee giuen to all who are not vnder the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;</hi> but ſo, as that the exception ſhould not bee expreſſed; in regard that when <hi>Iulius</hi> granted his pardon, except onely to thoſe who were ſubiect to the Inquiſitions of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> much was ſpoken againſt it, and it paſſed with ſmall reputation, as if the Pope had not the ſame power ouer that <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> as ouer others. But for the manner of expreſſing it, hee did referre it to the Synode. For the forme, hee commended that which the Councell gaue to <hi>Germanie</hi> in the yeere 1552, in regard that was ſeene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that ſo many Proteſtants came that yeere to <hi>Trent,</hi> vpon that ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Concerning the <hi>Index,</hi> he ordained that the deputies ſhould proceede, vntill an occaſion were offered to make a publique Decree without the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of any Prince.</p>
            <p>The anſwere being come, the ſecond of March and the day following Congregations were held, to reſolue whether the generall pardon ought to bee publiſhed, and a Safe Conduct granted, and what forme was to be giuen to the one and the other; and the fourth day, after long diſputations, all was concluded, the Legates hauing made the determination fall where they ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, without intereſting the Popes authority. To inuite the heretikes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance was omitted, for the reaſons alleadged in <hi>Rome.</hi> It was much diſputed, whether a Safe Conduct was to be giuen by the name of the French, Engliſh, and Scottiſh men; and ſome ſpake of the Greekes, and other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Eaſt. It was preſently ſeene that theſe poore men, afflicted in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude, could not, without danger and aſſiſtance of money, thinke of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels; and ſome ſayd that, there beeing a diuiſion of the Proteſtants, it was good to let them alone, and not to name them, alleadging that it was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to mooue in a body ill humours which were at quiet. To giue a Safe Conduct to Engliſh men which neither they, nor any of them doe require, would bee a great indignitie. They were content it ſhould bee giuen to the Scots, becauſe the Queene would demand it, but ſo, as that the demaund ſhould firſt bee made. For <hi>France,</hi> there was a doubt made whether the Kings Counſell would take it well or not, becauſe it would bee thought to bee a declaration that the King had rebels. Of <hi>Germanie</hi> none could doubt, becauſe it had beene formerly graunted to them; and if it were graunted to that Nation alone, it would ſeeme that the others were aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. Many thought fitte to grant it abſolutely to all Nations; but the Spaniards did oppoſe, and were fauoured by the Legates, and others who knew the Popes minde, to the great indignation of thoſe, who thought that an inference might bee made that the Councell was not aboue the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> of <hi>Spaine.</hi> In the ende all difficulties were reſolued, and the Decree framed with three parts. In the firſt a Safe Conduct was giuen to the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
               <pb n="483" facs="tcp:17208:251"/>
iuſt word by word, as it was made in the yeere 1552. In the ſecond, it was ſayd that the Synod doeth giue Safe Conduct in the ſame forme and words as it was giuen to the Dutchmen, to euery one who hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of faith with her, of euery Nation, Prouince, Citie and place where any thing is preached; taught, or beleeued, contrary to that which is belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the third it was ſayd, that although all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">The Decree of the Safe Conduct.</note> doe not ſeeme to be comprehended in that extention, which hath been done for certaine reſpects, yet thoſe who repent, and returne to the boſome of the Church, are not excluded, of what nation ſoeuer they be, which the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod deſireth ſhould be publiſhed to all. But becauſe it muſt be maturely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted on, in what forme the Safe Conduct muſt bee giuen them, they haue thought fit to deferre that point vntill another time, thinking it ſufficient, for the preſent to prouide for the ſecuritie of thoſe who haue publiquely aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the doctrine of the Church. The Decree was preſently printed, as was fit, it being made onely to bee publiſhed. Yet the Synode did not keepe promiſe, to conſult of the forme of the Safe Conduct, to be giuen to thoſe of the third kinde, and in printing of the body of the Councell, this third part was left out, leauing it to the ſpeculation of the world, why they did promiſe to prouide for thoſe alſo, and publiſh it in print, with a deſire to haue all men know it, and afterwards not to do it, and labour to conceale that, which then they did deſire to manifeſt.</p>
            <p>The Emperours Ambaſſadours ſollicited the Legates to make the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and to write to the Proteſtants, exhorting them to come to the Councell, as was done to the Bohemians, in the time of the Councell of <hi>Baſil.</hi> The Legats anſwered that, for theſe fourty yeeres, all, both Prince and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, haue deſired reformation, yet neuer any part thereof was handled, but themſelues did croſſe and hinder it, ſo that they haue been conſtrayned to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the worke; that now they will endeauour to make a generall refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of all Chriſtendome, but for one particularly for the Clergie of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> which doth moſt neede it, and which the Emperour doeth principally expect, they ſaw not how they could make it, ſeeing that the Dutch Prelats were not come to the Councell; and for writing to the Proteſtants, in regard they haue anſwered the Popes <hi>Nuncij</hi> with ſuch exorbitant vnſeemelineſſe, they could not but expect that they would make a worſe anſwere to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Synod.</p>

               <note place="margin">The Spaniſh Ambaſſadour is receiued, &amp; an oration is made in his name.</note> Ambaſſadour of the Catholique King, was receiued in a generall Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, his <hi>Mandate</hi> being read, an Oration was made on his name; the ſubſtance whereof was; That the Councell beeing the onely remedie for the euils of the Church, <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth hath, vpon good reaſon, thought it neceſſary in theſe times; in which <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> deſired to haue beene perſonally preſent, to giue example to other Princes: but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee cannot, hee hath ſent the Marquis, to aſſiſt and fauour it as much as poſſibly he can, knowing that howſoeuer the Church is defended by God, yet ſometimes it hath neede of the aſſiſtance of man. That the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour doeth not thinke it needfull to exhort the Synode, knowing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible and almoſt diuine wiſedome; that hee ſeeth good foundations laid already, and the things now treated on, managed with arte, which doeth mitigate, and exaſperate; ſo that hoping that their future actions will bee correſpondent, hee will onely promiſe all good offices, endeauours and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours

from the King. The <hi>Speaker</hi> anſwered, in the Councels name, that the comming of an Ambaſſadour from ſo great a King, had giuen courage and hope of the Synod that the remedies, which it ſhall vſe for the euils of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome, will be profitable, therefore it doeth imbrace his Maieſtie with all good affection thanketh him offereth to requite his merits, and to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it can for his honour; and doth, as it ought, receiue the <hi>Mandate.</hi> In <note place="margin">The anſwere of the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker.</note> the Congregation of the 18. the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Coſmo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Siena,</hi> was receiued; who, after his <hi>Mandate</hi> was read, made an Oration; <note place="margin">The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> in which hee ſhewed at large the affinitie of his Duke with the Pope, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Fathers to purge the Church, and declare the light of the truth, taught by the Apoſtles, offering all poſſible aſſiſtance from his Duke, as hee had done before to the Pope, for preſeruation of the Maieſtie of the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Speaker</hi> thanked him in the Synodes name, and, hauing made a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent commemoration of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, and <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeuenth, added that they were aſſembled onely for this end, and thought of nothing but of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing all diſſention, chaſing away the darkeneſſe of ignorance, and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the trueth.</p>

The Synode anſwered by the <hi>Speaker,</hi> that the piety and good deedes of the <hi>Heluetians</hi> towards the Apoſtolique Sea, were many and great; but no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or office more opportune then the Ambaſſage ſent; and the offer made to the Synode; that they were glad of the comming of the Ambaſſadours, and had, beſide the protection of the Emperour, Kings, and Princes, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in that famous Nation.</p>
            <p>In the Congregation of the ſixth of Aprill, <hi>Andreas Dudicius,</hi> Biſhop of <note place="margin">The Orators of the Clergy of <hi>Hungary</hi> are receiued.</note>

The firſt made an Oration, and ſayd; that the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Strigonium,</hi> the Biſhops and Clergie, had receiued great ioy for three things; for the aſſumption of <hi>Pius</hi> 4. to the Papacie, for the conuocation of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and for the deputation of the Apoſtolicall Legats to preſide in it. Hee ſhewed the obſeruance of the Prelates towards the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, and called the Cardinall of <hi>Varmia</hi> for a witneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who did knowe them, and conuerſed with them; hee expounded the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion of the Hungarians, and the ſeruice they doe to all Chriſtendome, in
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:17208:253"/>
maintaining warre againſt the Turkes, and the particular diligence of the Biſhops, in oppoſing the plots of the heretiques. Hee related the common deſire of them all to bee preſent in the Councell, if their preſence had not beene neceſſary at home, to defend their caſtles againſt the Turkes, who are at their confines, and to keepe watch againſt the heretiques; ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to performe this dutie by them their Orators, they recommended themſelues to the protection of the Councell, offering to receiue and obſerue whatſoeuer ſhould be decreed by it. The Secretary anſwered in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels name, that the Synod was aſſured of the ioy which the <hi>Hungarians</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued for the celebration of the Generall Councell; that they ought to pray God for the happy iſſue of it, that they deſired to haue ſeene the Prelates in perſon, but ſeeing they are hindered by the cauſes prooued by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armia,</hi> it doth accept their excuſe, hoping that Chriſtian Religion will receiue profit by their preſence in their owne Churches; and the rather becauſe they haue recommended their actions to them the Oratours, beeing honeſt and religious Fathers, and therefore that they doe embrace both them and their <hi>Mandates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Congregations dayly held from the ſeuenth day vntil the 18, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">The Article of reſidence is ſet on foot againe, and cauſeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note> ſpake of the 4. firſt Articles, but very confuſedly of the firſt, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Reſidence. Of thoſe who aſſiſted in the firſt Councell, when this point was handled, which was done with ſome difference, or rather contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie, there were but fiue Biſhops in this, and yet, at the firſt propoſing hereof, they preſently diuided themſelues into parts, as remembring the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient contention; which happened in no other queſtion, neither at that time, nor in the time of <hi>Iulius,</hi> nor at this preſent. Some ſay the cauſe was, for that the other diſcuſſions, beeing theologicall, were not well vnderſtood, and were handled ſpeculatiuely by the learned, without any paſſion but of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt the Proteſtants, who did trouble them, by ſetting on foot thoſe queſtions. But this touched the Prelates in their owne perſons. The cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers were mooued with ambition, or obliged to follow that opinion, which was moſt commodious for their Patrons. Others were caried away with enuie, who not hoping to raiſe themſelues to that height in which the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers were, deſired to pull them lower, and ſo to become equall. In this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle euery one laboured according to his paſſion, and kept a ſtrict account of his owne voyce deliuered in the Congregations, and of all the voyces of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which were any way remarkeable. Of this number 34. came into my hands, in that forme as they were deliuered, and of the others I haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the concluſion onely: but here nothing is to be related but that which is of note.</p>
            <p>The Patriarke of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> ſaid, That this Article had been handled, and <note place="margin">The Suffrage of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arke of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> diſcuſſed in the firſt Councell, and concluded, that, to cauſe reſidence, there are two prouiſions: One, to conſtitute puniſhments for thoſe who doe not reſide; another, to remooue the impediments which doe hinder reſidencie. The firſt was fully ordered in the ſixt Seſſion, neither can any thing bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in regard the loſſe of halfe the reuenues is a very great pecuniary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then which a greater cannot be impoſed, without making the Biſhops beggars. If the contumacie bee exceſſiue, there can bee no greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:17208:253"/>
except depriuation; which requiring one to execute it, which muſt needs be the Pope, in regard the ancient vſe of the Church was, to reſerue to that Sea the hearing and determining of the cauſes of Biſhops, that ſixt Seſſion referred it to his Holineſſe to finde a remedie, either by meanes of a new prouiſion, or otherwiſe, and bound the Metropolitane to aduiſe him of the abſence. For the ſecond they beganne to make prouiſion, and, in that, and other Seſſions, many Decrees were made, to take away many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions, which hindered the Biſhops to exerciſe their charge. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it now remaineth onely to continue, and to remooue the reſidue of the impediments, electing a certaine number of Fathers, as then was done, to make collection of them, that they may bee propoſed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for.</p>
            <p>The Archbiſhop of <hi>Granata</hi> added, that a more potent and effectuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie <note place="margin">The ſuffrage of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Granada.</hi>
               </note> was propoſed in that Councell; that is, that the obligation of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was by the Law of God, which was handled and examined tenne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths together; and that if that Councell had not been interrupted, it would haue beene decided as a neceſſary, yea, as a principall article of the doctrine of the Church, and was then not onely diſcuſſed, but the reaſons vſed by diuers were put in print alſo, ſo that the matter is prepared and digeſted, and nothing now remaineth, but to giue it perfection. When it ſhall be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that reſidencie is <hi>de iure Diuino,</hi> all hinderances will ceaſe of themſelues; the Biſhops vnderſtanding their duety, wil thinke on their owne conſcience; they will not be reputed hirelings, but Paſtors, who knowing that the flocke is giuen to them by God, to whom they muſt make an account, without lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fault on others, and being aſſured that diſpenſations wil neither ſaue, nor helpe them, they will apply themſelues to performe their duety. And he proceeded to proue, with many authorities of the New and Old Teſtament, <note place="margin">Is approved by the maior part.</note> and expoſition of the Fathers, that this was the Catholike truth. This opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was approoued by the maior part of the Congregation, the maintainers whereof laboured to bring authorities and reaſons.</p>
            <p>Others did reiect it, and ſaid it was new, neuer defended, neither by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, <note place="margin">And reiected by others.</note> nor by this age before Cardinall <hi>Caietan,</hi> who ſet the queſtion on foote, and maintained that part, which notwithſtanding hee did abandon in his old age, becauſe hee tooke a Biſhopricke, and did neuer reſide; that the Church hath euer held, that the Pope might diſpenſe, that Non-reſidents haue alwayes beene puniſhed, and reprehended as tranſgreſſors of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons onely, and not of the Law of God; that, indeede, it was diſputed in the firſt Councell, but the diſputation was held to be ſo dangerous by the Legats, men of great wiſedome, that they did cunningly cauſe it to bee buried in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; that this example ought to be followed, and that the bookes which haue beene written ſince, haue giuen great ſcandall to the world, and made knowen, that the diſputation proceeded from partiality. For the authorities of the Scripture and Fathers, they are onely exhortations to perfection, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any ſubſtantiall proofe but out of the Canons, which are Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall lawes.</p>
            <p>Some held opinion that there was neither place, nor time, nor opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to handle that queſtion, &amp; that no good could come by the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:17208:254"/>
of it, but danger of many inconueniences; that the Councell was aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to extirpate hereſies, not to make Schiſme among the Catholiques, which would happen by condemning an opinion, followed, if not by the greater part, yet by one halfe at the leaſt; that the authours of that opinion haue not inuented it for trueths ſake, but the more to vrge men to reſide, with ſmall ground of reaſon, in regard that the Lawes of GOD are not more diligently obſerued then the Lawes of the Church; that the precept for keeping of Lent is more ſtrictly obſerued, then thoſe of the Decalogue; that if to confeſſe and communicate at Eaſter were commanded by GOD, <note place="margin">The lawes of the Pope are more ſtrictly obſerued then the lawes of God.</note> more would not doe it then now doe; that to ſay Maſſe with <hi>Copes</hi> is an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall law, and yet no man doth tranſgreſſe it, hee that doth not obey the penall commands of the Canons, will tranſgreſſe much more when hee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth onely the iuſtice of GOD: neither will any Biſhop be mooued with that determination, but it will giue occaſion to plot rebellions againſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique Sea, to reſtraine the Popes authority, and (as ſome haue been heard to whiſper) to depreſſe the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> that that was the ornament of the Clergie, which is reſpected in other places, onely in regard of it, that if it ſhould be depreſſed, the Church would euery where be leſſe eſteemed; and therefore that it was not fit to handle ſuch a buſineſſe, without imparting it to his Holineſſe and Colledge of Cardinals, to whom it doeth principally belong.</p>
            <p>The opinion of <hi>Paulus Iouius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nocera</hi> is not to be omitted; who <note place="margin">The Suffrage of <hi>Paulus Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nocera.</hi>
               </note> ſaid in ſubſtance. That certainly the Councel was aſſembled to cure a great wound, which is the deformation of the Church, the cauſe whereof, as all are perſwaded, is the abſence of the Prelats from their Churches; which beeing affirmed by all, is perhaps not ſufficiently conſidered by any. But it is not the part of a wiſe Phyſician to take away the cauſe before hee be well aſſured that the remoouing of it will not cauſe greater diſeaſes. If the abſence of Prelats hath beene the cauſe of the corruptions, there will bee leſſe deforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in thoſe Churches where they haue reſided. The Popes, for theſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres, haue continually ſate in <hi>Rome,</hi> and vſed all diligence to inſtruct the people: yet we doe not ſee that that citie is better gouerned then others. The great capitall Cities of Kingdomes are moſt out of order, where the Prelats haue alwayes reſided; on the contrary, ſome poore cities, which haue not ſeene a Biſhop in an hundred yeeres, are leſſe corrupted; that amongſt the ancient Prelats here preſent, who haue continually reſided in their Churches, of which number there are ſome, not one can ſhew that his Dioces is better then the next, which haue continued without a Biſhop. If any ſay they are a flocke without a ſhepherd, let him conſider that not Biſhops only, but Pariſh Prieſts alſo haue cure of ſoules, and that there are mountaines which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neuer ſeene Biſhops, may be a paterne to Epiſcopall Cities. That the zeale and care of the Fathers of the firſt Councell is to bee commended, and imitated, who, by penalties, haue incited the Prelats to remaine in their owne Churches, and begun to remooue the impediments which did hinder them; but they were deceiued if they did hope that this reſidencie would be a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reformation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea, they ought to feare, that as reſidencie is now requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſo poſteritie, ſeeing the inconueniences that ariſe from thence, wil deſire
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:17208:254"/>
their abſence. That they ought not to make ſuch ſtrong bonds as cannot in time of neede bee looſed, ſuch as <hi>Ius Diuinum</hi> would bee, which they now begin to alleadge, 1400 yeeres after CHRIST Where there is a pernicious Biſhop, as was that of <hi>Collen,</hi> he will defend himſelfe by this doctrine, in not obeying the Pope, when he ſhall cite him to giue an account of his actions, or keepe him farre off, that he may not cheriſh the euill. He added, that hee ſaw that the Prelates who were of the contrary opinion had a good zeale, but did beleeue alſo that ſome of them would bee content to make vſe of it, to withdraw themſelues from the Popes obedience, which the ſtricter it is, the more it doth hold the Church vnited. He put them in minde alſo, that what ſoeuer they doe heerein, will turne to the fauour of Pariſh Prieſts alſo, to withdraw themſelues from obedience to their Biſhops. For the Articles being thus expounded, they will make vſe of it, and ſay, that the Biſhop cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue them from their Churches, nor reſtraine their authoritie by reſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and, being Paſtors immediatly ſent by God, they will pretend that the flocke doth more belong to them then to the Biſhop, and no anſwere can be made againſt it. And as hitherto the gouernment of the Church hath been preſerued by meanes of the <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> ſo this will cauſe a <hi>Popularity,</hi> and an <hi>Anarchie,</hi> which will deſtroy it.</p>

This is forbidden by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who thought it neceſſary that a ſouldier of the Church ſhould ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from ſecular employments. Let Gods command bee executed, and them for bidden to take any charge, office, or degree, ordinary or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, in the affaires of the world; and then there being no cauſe for them to remaine at Court, they will goe to their reſidencie, of their owne accord, without commaund or penaltie, and will not haue any occaſion to depart from thence. In concluſion, he deſired that the Councell would conſtitute, that it ſhould not bee lawfull for Biſhops or others, who haue cure of ſoules, to exerciſe any ſecular office or charge.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of fiue Churches, the Emperours Ambaſſadour, oppoſed and <note place="margin">Is oppoſed by the Biſhop of fiue Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour.</note> ſayd, that if the words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> were to bee vnderſtood according to the ſence which was giuen them, the whole Church was to be condemned, and all Princes, ſince the yeere 800, vntill now, for that for which they princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally deſerue to be commended, theſe in giuing, and thoſe in accepting tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Iuriſdictions; which alſo haue beene exerciſed by the Popes, and by Biſhops placed in the Catalogue of Saints. The beſt Emperours, Kings of <hi>France, Spaine, England,</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> haue euer had their Counſels full of Prelates, all which muſt bee condemned, if Gods precept doe forbid them to
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:17208:255"/>
exerciſe thoſe charges. Hee that thinketh <hi>Paul</hi> his command doth compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Eccleſiaſticall perſons onely, is deceiued: For it is directed to all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtians, who are the Souldiers of Chriſt, and inferreth, that as the worldly ſouldier doeth not buſiehimſelfe in the Artes by which life is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, becauſe they are repugnant to his profeſſion, ſo the Souldier of Chriſt, that is, euery Chriſtian, ought to abſtaine from thoſe things which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Chriſtian profeſſion, which are ſinnes onely; but whatſoeuer may be done without ſinne, is lawfull for euery one. The Prelates that ſerue in thoſe affaires, cannot be reprehended, except it be ſaid that they are ſinnes. The greatneſſe of the Church, and the eſteeme the world maketh thereof, proceedeth moſt from Eccleſiaſticall dignities, placed in perſons of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and of great blood, and from Prelates exerciſed in charges of importance; which if they ſhould bee incompatible to the Clergie, no perſon nobly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended would enter into that order, no Prelate would bee eſteemed, and the Church would conſiſt onely of people baſely borne, and liuing baſely. But, on the contrary, the good doctors haue euer maintained, that thoſe Statutes are againſt Eccleſiaſticall libertie, which exclude from publique adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Eccleſiaſticall perſons, to whom they belong by right of birth; as alſo the prohibitions that publique charges cannot be giuen to Prieſts. This was heard with applauſe of all the Prelates, euen of thoſe who thought that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence was <hi>deiure Diuino;</hi> ſo potent are the affections of men, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">Who gaineth an applauſe.</note> they ſuffer them not to diſcerne contradictions.</p>
            <p>Of the other Articles a light diſcuſſion onely was made; yet ſomething <note place="margin">A briefe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Authoar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the title of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triimonie.</note> was ſaid worth the noting. For the ſecond, for prohibiting ordinations to the title of the Patrimony, it is certaine, that ſince the Church was conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and eſtabliſhed, and neceſſarie miniſteries deputed in it, no man was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned, in the good times of it, but vnto ſome proper miniſtery. But this good vſe was quickly turned into an abuſe. For in regard of the exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of diuers, and of other worldly reſpects, and becauſe the Biſhops deſired to haue a great Clergie, they ordained whoſoeuer came vnto them for it. Therefore this ſort of ordination was forbidden in the Councell of <hi>Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which was then called abſolute, or looſe, (for ſo the Greeke word doeth properly ſignifie) commanding that none ſhould be ordained but vnto a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular charge, and that the looſe ordinations ſhould beenullified, and made voyd. This was afterwards confirmed by the Canons, ſo that this rule re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained as a Maxime, eſtabliſhed in the Church, that no man could bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained without a title; and in the ancient and good times, by a title was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood a charge, or miniſtery to be exerciſed. But after that corruptions were entred, a title was taken for a reuenue to liue vpon, and that which was conſtituted to this end, that amongſt the Clergie no perſon might bee idle, was thus transformed, that no perſon might want, and bee forced to worke for his liuing. And the true ſenſe of the Canons beeing couered by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, <hi>Alexander</hi> the third did eſtabliſh it in his <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that none ſhould be ordained without a title, by which hee may receiue prouiſion, neceſſary for his life, with this exception, if he had no inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his owne, or from his father; which would bevery reaſonable if a title were required onely to maintaine life. For this cauſe many, ſhewing they
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:17208:255"/>
had a Patrimonie, by falſe proofes, were ordained; others, after they were ordained to a true patrimony, did aliene it; and others, borrowing a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent patrimony vntill they were ordeined, did afterwards reſtore it to him that had lent it; ſo that there were many poore Prieſts, and many inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences cauſed, which required that prouiſion ſhould be made for them.</p>
            <p>This Article being propoſed to the Synode, there were diuers opinions. <note place="margin">In which point diuers opinions are deliuered in Councel.</note> Some ſayd, that it being eſtabliſhed that reſidencie is <hi>de Iure diuino,</hi> and euery one exerciſing his charge, the Churches will bee perfectly ſerued, and there will be no neede of Clergie men not beneficed, or of ordinations to the title of patrimonie or any other, and all inconueniences will bee remedied. For there will bee no idle perſon in the Clergie, from whom innumerable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes and bad examples doe come, there will bee no beggar, nor any forced to vſe baſe trades. They ſayd, that no reformation was good, but that which did reduce things to their beginning; that the primitiue Church did continue many yeeres in perfection, and that the integrity thereof could by this meanes only be reſtored. There was another opinion, that none ſhould be denied to take holy orders, who, for honeſtie or ſufficiencie, did deſerue them, although they were poore, alleadging that the poore were not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Primitiue Church, which did not diſlike that Clerkes and Prieſts ſhould liue by their labour, by the example of S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, and of <hi>Apollo</hi> the Euangeliſt, who liued by making Pauilions. And after that Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Chriſtians, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> gaue, in his ſixt Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, a priuiledge to the Clergie, that they ſhould not pay any Subſidie for that which they did traffique in ſhops and worke-houſes, becauſe they gaue ſome of their gaines to the poore. The inſtruction of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full was obſerued, that they ſhould labour in honeſt workes, that they might haue whereof to giue to the poore. They ſaid that an idle and wicked life was vnſeemely in the Clergie, becauſe it gaue ſcandall; but to liue of ones la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was honeſt, and tended to edification; and if any were forced to beg becauſe of ſickneſſe, it was no ſhame, no more then to the Friars who holde it for a glory to bee accounted beggars; that it was not a Chriſtian propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that to labour to liue by ones hands, to begge in caſe of impotencie, was vndecent to the Miniſters of CHRIST, and that nothing was vnſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but vice. And if any thought that want was cauſe of theft, or other ſinnes, hee ſhall finde, when he thinketh better on it, that theſe bee ſinnes of the rich rather then of the poore, and that auarice is more impotent, and vnta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, then pouerty, which, beeing alwayes buſie, doth take away occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of doing ill. An honeſt man and a poore man are compatible, but not an honeſt man and an idle man. The great benefit which the Church militant in this worlde, and that which is Purgatorie doeth receiue by Maſſes, celebrated by poore Prieſts, and not by rich, is both written and preached; of which number if none were, the faithfull liuing, and the ſoules of the dead would bee depriued of great ſuffrages; that it were better that a ſtrict order ſhould bee made, that perſons of honeſty and ſufficiencie ſhould be ordained without a title, ſeeing that now the cauſe doeth ceaſe for which Antiquitie forbade it, which was, for that thoſe who had titles, labouring in their Eccleſiaſticall functions, did edifie, and the others, beeing idle, did giue
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:17208:256"/>
ſcandall, whereas now thoſe that haue titles doe, for the moſt part, diſdaine the Eccleſiaſticall miniſterie, and liue in pleaſure, and the poore performe the functions, and doe edifie.</p>
            <p>This opinion was not followed by many. But a middle opinion had great applauſe; which was, that the vſe ſhould bee ſtill obſerued, not to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine without a title to an Eccleſiaſticall benefice, or a ſufficient patrimonie, that Prieſts might not diſhonour their order by begging, and that it ſhould bee conſtituted, to remooue all fraud, that the Biſhop ſhould prouide that the patrimonie, to which the Clerke is ordained, might not bee alienated. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel de Veneur,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Viuiers,</hi> contradicted this, and ſaid, that the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Clerkes is a ſecular thing, concerning which the Clergie cannot: poſſibly make any law: beſides many occaſions may ariſe, for which the Law, or the Magiſtrate may lawfully command it to bee alienated. And it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally true that the patrimoniall goods of Clerkes, for preſcriptions, and all ſorts of contracts, are ſubiect to the ciuill lawes, and therefore that they ought to conſider well of the buſineſſe, before they aſſume authoritie to breake a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill contract.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of propoſing the third Article was, becauſe the precept of <note place="margin">Concerning Simonie.</note> CHRIST, that all ſpirituall graces ſhould bee freely conferred, as <hi>they are freely receiued</hi> from him, was many wayes tranſgreſſed in the collation of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> which abuſe was not new, but greater in former times. For, in the beginning of Chriſtianitie, charitie abounding, the people who receiued ſpirituall things, from the Miniſters of CHRIST, did not onely, according to the diuine precept expounded by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> contribute to them as much as ſerued for their neceſſities, but enough alſo to maintaine the poore, neuer thinking that the temporall was a price of the Spirituall. But after that the temporall, which was held and inioyed in common, was diuided, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenue applyed to the titles, called a Benefice, the ordination being not then diſtinct from the collation of the title, and by conſequence of the Benefice annexed to it, but both being giuen and receiued together, it ſeemed to the ordainers, that, beſide the ſpirituall thing, they gaue alſo a temporall, for which they might receiue another temporall thing in recompence, which hee that would obtaine, was forced to accommodate himſelfe to the will of him that could giue it, ſo that open buying and ſelling was eaſily brought in, which, in the orientall Church, could neuer be corrected, though many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and cenſures were made againſt it. Yet it was much diminiſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God tooke from them, by the rod of the Saracens, a great part of their goods. And, in the Weſt, though it was much reprehended by good men, yet it continued, in ſome places more, in ſome leſſe, vntill, about the yeere 1000. the ordination was diuided from the collation of the Benefice, for which cauſe that did beginne to paſſe for nothing, and Simony did ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this, and that more openly then before. And this abuſe did alwayes increaſe, though vnder diuers names of <hi>Annates,</hi> ſmall ſeruices, writing, ſeale, and other pretences, which the Church ſtill vſeth, with ſmall hope that they can euer be taken away, vntill CHRIST come againe, with his whip, ouerthrow the tables of the money changers, and chaſe them out of the Temple. But the ordination, which, being ſeparated from the Benefice,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:17208:256"/>
had the fortune to bee conferred freely, did inioy it but a ſmall time. For the Biſhops eſteeming it vnprofitable and baſe, and regarding more the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which yeelded fruit, left off, by little and little, to adminiſter the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; ſo that titular Biſhops were inſtituted, who performed the Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall Eccleſiaſticall miniſteries, and the true Biſhops buſied themſelues in the temporall onely. Thoſe, hauing no reuenues, were forced to maintaine themſelues by the adminiſtration of thoſe functions. Whereupon hee that receiued <hi>Order</hi> was compelled to contribute, firſt by the name of almes or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, afterwards, to make it more honourable, by the title of donatiue or preſent, and, proceeding further, that it might not bee omitted as being a due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it was couered with the name of reward, not of the <hi>Ordayner,</hi> but of his ſeruants, or of the <hi>Notarie,</hi> or of ſome other who ſerued him in the ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore in this Article it was propoſed, that the abuſe occurring in the collation of Benefices ſhould not bee ſpoken of; as beeing an infirmitie; not curable with any remedie but death.</p>
            <p>Concerning which the Prelates were diuided, not by opinions, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but by qualitie of perſons. The rich Biſhops condemned the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of any thing; either for themſelues or their officers, or Notaries, as Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicall, and ſacrilegious, bringing the example of <hi>Ieheſie</hi> ſeruant of the Prophet <hi>Elizeus,</hi> and of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and of the ſeuere commaundement of CHRIST, <hi>Giue freely as you haue receiued.</hi> They alleadged alſo many exaggerations out of the Fathers againſt this ſinne, ſaying, that the names of a voluntary donatiue, or almes, are vaine colours repugnant to trueth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the gift is beſtowed for the <hi>Order,</hi> without which it would not haue beene giuen. And if it bee an almes, why is it giuen vpon that occaſion onely? let it be made at another time, and <hi>Orders</hi> conferred without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of any thing. But the miſchiefe is, that if one ſhould tell the <hi>Ordainer</hi> that hee gaue him an almes, hee would hold it for an iniurie, nor would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it at another time. Therefore they ought not to beleeue, that they could deceiue God and the world. They concluded that an abſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ought to bee made, that nothing ſhould bee giuen, though willingly, or vnder the name of almes, nor receiued, not onely by the <hi>Ordainer,</hi> but alſo by any of his, or by the <hi>Notarie,</hi> vnder the name of writing, ſeale, paines, or any other Pretence whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p>But the poore Biſhops and the Titular ſayd to the contrary, that as to giue order for a price was a wicked ſacriledge, ſo to take away almes, ſo much commended by CHRIST, did deſtroy charitie, and wholly deforme the Church. That there was the ſame reaſon abſolutely for <hi>Ordinations,</hi> which is for <hi>Confeſsions, Communions, Maſſes, Burials</hi> and other Eccleſiaſticall functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and therefore no cauſe why that ſhould be forbidd in <hi>Ordination,</hi> which is allowed in all theſe; and the allegation, that if it bee an Almes, let it bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen at another time, is of as much force in all the other functions. The Church hath vſed, from the beginning, to receiue oblations and almes, vpon theſe occaſions, which if they ſhall bee taken away, the poore religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who liue of them, will bee forced to take ſome other courſe, the rich will not performe the offices, as doeth, and, for the ſpace of fiue hundred yeeres, hath plainely appeared, ſo that the exerciſe of Religion will bee loſt,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:17208:257"/>
and the people, remaining without it, will fall into impietie, and diuers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious ſuperſtitions. And if thouſands of crownes are giuen without repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion for the veſtments which the Apoſtolike Sea giueth to the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans, how can a ſmall acknowledgement be reprehended, which the Biſhop receiueth from the inferiour Orders? What reaſon is there that things of the ſame kinde ſhould be ordered by contrary lawes? That cannot be called an abuſe which was inſtituted in the beginning. And it remaineth ſtill in the <hi>Pontificall,</hi> that waxe candles are preſented, by thoſe that are ordayned, to the Biſhop ordaining, at the offering place, in time of the <hi>Ordinations,</hi> which be temporall things, and, if they bee great, and well adorned, may coſt much. It is not therefore ſo bad as it is painted out, neither can the oppoſites game, by the infamie of poore Biſhops, the name of reformers, imitating the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, in obſeruing moathes, and ſtraining at gnats.</p>
            <p>Some ſayd alſo that it could not bee conſtituted, as being contrary to the decree of <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, in the generall Councell, where the vſe of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and receiuing a temporall thing, in the miniſtery of the Sacraments, is not onely approoued, but the Biſhops are commanded to compell the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by cenſures and Eccleſiaſticall puniſhments, to obſerue the cuſtome, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the title of laudable to thoſe things, which now ſome goe about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne as ſacrilegious.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Diniſius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milopotamus,</hi> made a long digreſſion, to ſhew how the faithfull would bee edified, if the Sacraments were adminiſtred by the Clergie for pure charitie, expecting no reward but from God onely. Hee affirmed that neceſſaries were to bee allowed them, and greater prouiſion alſo; but that this was ſufficiently and ſuperaboundantly done, by the aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Tithes, becauſe they, not being the tenth part of the people, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue ſo great a portion, beſides other poſſeſſions which are double as much. Therefore it is not iuſt to demand that which is already receiued an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred folde; and if the Biſhops bee poore, it is not becauſe the Church is poore, but becauſe the riches are ill diuided. With an euen diſtribution e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one might be fitted; and that might be giuen without counter change, for which more then the iuſt price hath beene already receiued. Hee added, that, if this multitude of abuſes could not bee taken away altogether, it would bee good to beginne with that of Ordinations, not reſtraining it to the onely action of conferring the Sacraments, but extending it alſo to the precedent. For it would be a great abſurditie that one ſhould pay too deere, in the Chanceries of Biſhoprickes, for <hi>dimiſorie</hi> letters, by which the Clerke hath leaue to finde out one that will ordaine him, and in <hi>Rome</hi> to be ordained out of the times appointed, and lay the reformation onely vpon the Biſhops that doe ordaine. This opinion was approoued by many, in reſpect of the <hi>dimiſories</hi> of Biſhops; but concerning the <hi>Facultie</hi> giuen at <hi>Rome,</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Simoneta</hi> ſayd, that the Pope would prouide for it, and that it was not a thing to be handled in Councell.</p>
            <p>Concerning the reward of <hi>Notaries</hi> ſome thing was ſaid. For ſome eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it an office purely ſecular, thought that their pay ought not to bee ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Others held it for an Eccleſiaſtical office. <hi>Antonius Augustinus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lerida,</hi> an antiquarie, ſaid, that in the ancient Church the Miniſters were
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:17208:257"/>
ordained in preſence of all the people, ſo that there was no neede of letters Patents or teſtimoniall, and after they had gained a title they did not change Dioceſſe; and if, for any cauſe, they did make a iourney, they had a letter from the Biſhop, then called <hi>Formata.</hi> The vſe of letters teſtimoniall began after that the people left to bee preſent at the <hi>Ordinations,</hi> and the Clerkes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to bee vagabonds, and, being introduced in ſupplement of the preſence of the people, is to bee eſteemed a temporall office; but, becauſe it is applied to a ſpirituall matter, it is to bee vſed with moderation. Therefore his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was, that ſome reward ſhould bee allowed for them, but moderated, and limited.</p>
            <p>That which was propoſed in the fourth poynt belongeth onely to the <note place="margin">Concerning diſtributions.</note> Collegiate Churches; which hauing by their inſtitution, this function, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, to aſſemble themſelues in the Church to prayſe God, at the houres appointed by the Canons, which therefore are called Canonicall, rents were annexed to them for the maintenance of the Canons, diſtributed amongſt them in one of theſe foure manners. For either they liued at a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon table and charge, as the Regulars, or euery one had his portion of rents aſſigned to him; (which therefore was called a Prebend) or, the ſeruice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, all was diſtributed amongſt them, either in meate, or money. Thoſe that liued in common continued in that diſcipline but a ſmall time, but came to diuiſion, either into Prebends, or diſtributions to the Preben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, excuſing thoſe from performing thoſe diuine offices, who, by reaſon of infirmitie, or ſome ſpirituall buſineſſe, could not bee preſent. It was an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thing to find a pretence, and begin an vſe of being ſeldome in the Church, and to enioy the Prebend notwithſtanding. But hee, vnto whom the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was diſtributed, after the worke was done, could not bee excuſed; ſo that diſcipline, and frequencie in the <hi>Offices</hi> remained longer in this ſecond kinde, then in the firſt. For this cauſe the faithfull, when they gaue or bequeathed any thing to the Churches, ordained it ſhould bee put in diſtributions: and experience ſhewed, that the greater the diſtributions were, the better the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> were performed, and that the negligence of thoſe who did not aſſiſt in the offices might bee redreſſed, by taking part of the Prebends, and making diſtributions thereof. This was much commended by many of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, thinking the worſhip of God would bee much inlarged heereby; whereof there could no doubt bee made, becauſe it did appeare already by experience. And this was all which was ſpoken for a ground of this opinion.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Lucas Biſantius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cataro,</hi> a godly man, but poore, ſpake to the contrary, that rather the Prebendaries ſhould bee forced, by cenſures, and depriuations of part, or of all the fruites, and of the Prebends them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but that the firſt forme ſhould not bee altered. For almoſt all theſe inſtitutions being made by the laſt will of the faithfull, they ought to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued inuiolably, and without alteration, not onely vpon pretence of better, but not for that which is truely and certainely better, in regard it is not iuſt to meddle with that which belongeth to another, becauſe hee doeth not vſe it well. But, which is of more importance, to exerciſe a ſpirituall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for reward is vndoubted Simonie, ſo that by driuing out one euil, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:17208:258"/>
would enter farre worſe, making negligent men to become Simoniacall. The other part anſwered, that the Councell had power to change laſt willes; and, for aſſiſting at diuine <hi>Offices</hi> for gaine, one muſt diſtinguiſh, that the gaine is not the principall, but the ſecondary cauſe, and therefore there is no ſinne in it; for the Canons will goe to Church principally to ſerue God, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily for the diſtributions. The others replyed, that they ſaw not how the Councell had greater power ouer the goods of the dead, then of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, which no man is ſo impertinent as to pretend; and beſides the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is not ſo ſecure as it is affirmed, that it is lawfull to ſerue God for gaine ſecondarily. And if it were, it is not a ſecondary, but a principall cauſe, which firſt mooueth, and without which the worke would not bee done. This opinion was not pleaſing, and rayſed much murmuring in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. For euery one beeing conſcious to himſelfe that hee receiued the title and charge onely in regard of the rents, did thinke hee was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Therefore the Article had great applauſe that the Prebends ſhould bee turned into diſtributions, to incite men to ſerue God, in the beſt manner they could.</p>
            <p>Theſe Articles hauing beene thus diſcuſſed, Fathers were deputed to make <note place="margin">Fathers are deputed to frame the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> the Decrees; and it was propoſed that, in the next Congregations, they ſhould ſpeake of ſixe more, leauing that of ſecret mariage for another Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The next day the Legates and Deputies met, to collect the ſubſtance of the opinions of the Fathers; and, concerning the firſt Article of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie, they diſſented amongſt themſelues. <hi>Simoneta</hi> fauoured the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The Legates diſſent in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> that it was <hi>de iure poſitiuo,</hi> and ſayd, that the greater part, euen thoſe who held it was <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> thought fitte that the queſtion ſhould bee omitted. <hi>Mantua,</hi> without manifeſting his owne opinion, ſayd that the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber did demand a declaration of it. Of the other Legates, <hi>Altemps</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Simoneta,</hi> and the other two, though with ſome caution, adhered to <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua.</hi> And this difference did not paſle without ſome bitterneſſe, though mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly expreſſed. For this cauſe the Legates held a generall Congregation, the 20. day; in which the demand following was read out of a paper: that is; Becauſe many Fathers haue ſayd that reſidence is <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> ſome haue ſayd nothing, and others ſpoken againſt the making of the declaration, to the end, that thoſe who are deputed to make the Decrees, may make them quickely, eaſily, and ſecurely, your Lordſhips may bee pleaſed to deliuer your opinions, onely with the word <hi>placet,</hi> whether you approoue or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue the declaration, that reſidencie is <hi>de iure diuino:</hi> becauſe, according to the cuſtome of this holy Synod, the Decree ſhall bee made as the greater number ſhall giue their voyces; which becauſe they had beene formerly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in great variety, they deſired that they would all ſpeake diſtinctly, one after one, that their ſuffrages might be noted.</p>
            <p>All hauing giuen their voyces, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="497" facs="tcp:17208:258"/>
hee did like it. This was a very ſubtile difference, and vſed onely where eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one doeth thinke to doe his Maſter the beſt ſeruice. The Cardinall <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druccio</hi> would not preciſely anſwere to the interrogation, but ſaid, he referred himſelfe to his voyce, deliuered in Congregation, which was in fauour of <hi>Ius diuinum.</hi> And the Biſhop of <hi>Budua</hi> ſaid, that hee held the affirmatiue as already concluded, and that he thought fit it ſhould be publiſhed. The voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beeing collected and diuided, and it appearing that the greater part, by one halfe, did approoue the declaration, that a fourth part onely did diſlike it, and that others, though conditionally, were with the firſt, they came to words of ſome bitterneſſe, and the reſidue of the Congregation was ſpent in diſcourſing heereof, not without much confuſion. Which the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> perceiuing, made a ſilence, and, exhorting the Fathers to modeſty, gaue them leaue to depart.</p>
            <p>The Legates conſulted what was fit to bee done; and agreed to giue the <note place="margin">Whereof the Legates giue the Pope an account.</note> Pope an exact account of all, and expect his anſwere, and in the meane while to proſecute in the Congregations the Articles remayning. <hi>Mantua</hi> would haue ſent his Secretarie, <hi>Camillus Oliuo,</hi> by poſt, with letters of credence, and <hi>Simoneta</hi> would haue all expreſſed in the letters. They concluded to temper theſe two opinions: that is, to write a very large letter, and referre that which remained to the Secretary: who the ſame day parted from <hi>Trent,</hi> in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

               <note place="margin">A blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous prouerb was vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The world was in hope that, if once a Councel might be obtayned, all inconueniences would be redreſſed; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing obſerued how things were caried, vnder two Popes before, and how they are gouerned now, all hope of any good is extinguiſhed, nor any more to be hoped for from the Councel, if it muſt ſerue to bee a miniſter of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and mooue or ſtand ſtill at their pleaſure.</p>
            <p>This gaue occaſion, beginning in the next Congregation to diſcuſſe the Articles propoſed, briefly to ſpeake of the point of Reſidencie. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armia</hi> ſayd, that that matter was ſufficiently treated on, that the Decree ſhould bee framed to reſolue it; which beeing propoſed euery one might ſay what hee thought fit: but hee could not quiet the humors that were mooued. Therefore the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> the Emperours Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, made a continuate ſpeach, to exhort the Fathers to proceede peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and with leſſe paſſion, admoniſhing them to conſider what did become their perſons, and that place: But <hi>Iulius Superchius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caurle,</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red cholerikely, that nothing doth leſſe beſeeme the Councel, then to lay a law vpon the Prelates, eſpecially when it is done by one who repreſenteth a Secular authority; and vſed ſome biting termes: ſo that the Congregation
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:17208:259"/>
was like to be diuided into parts. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armienſe,</hi> who was Preſident in it, ſeeking to moderate them, diuerted the ſpeech vpon other Articles, appointed for that day, and propoſed that ſome meanes ſhould bee vſed to ſet at liberty the Engliſh Biſhops, who were in priſon in <hi>England,</hi> that, comming to the Councel, it might be ſaid, that that noble Nation was preſent alſo, and not wholly aliened from the Church. This pleaſed all: but the common opinion was, that it might ſooner bee deſired then hoped for. They concluded that <note place="margin">A conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Councel to ſet at liberty the Engliſh Biſhops who were in priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the Queene hauing refuſed to receiue a <hi>Nuncio,</hi> expreſſely ſent from the Pope, it could not be hoped that ſhe would hearken to the Councel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all they could doe was to perſwade Catholique Princes to mediate for them. The 25. beeing S. <hi>Markes</hi> day, the Venetian Ambaſſadors were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, <note place="margin">The Venetian Ambaſſadors are receiued in Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> in the generall Congregation, whoſe <hi>Mandat</hi> being read dated the 11. of the ſame Moneth, and an Oration made by <hi>Nicolas di Tonte,</hi> one of them, an anſwere was giuen in the vſuall forme.</p>
            <p>In thoſe few dayes, the wiſeſt amongſt the Prelates, conſidering what a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation it would be to the Councel, and themſelues, if thoſe ſtirs were not pacified, endeuoured to pacifie mens minds by ſhewing that if the Conciliary actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were not proſecuted without tumult, beſides the ſcandall &amp; the ſhame, the diſſolution of the Councell, without doing any good, would neceſſarily follow. This remonſtrance tooke effect; and cauſed them to treat peaceably of the ſixe Articles remaining; of which there was not much to bee ſpoken. For the fifth, the prouiſion was thought neceſſary; but there was a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie concerning the manner, becauſe the diuiſion of Pariſhes was firſt made by the people, when a certaine number of inhabitants, hauing receiued the true faith, built a temple for exerciſe of their religion, hired a Prieſt, and did <note place="margin">The diuiſion of Pariſhes.</note> conſtitute a Church, which, by the neighbours, was called a Pariſh; and when the number was encreaſed, if one Church and Prieſt were not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, thoſe who were moſt remote did build another, and fit themſelues bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In progreſſe of time, for good order and concord, a cuſtome began to haue the Biſhops conſent alſo. But after that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> aſſumed by reſeruations the collation of Benefices, thoſe who were prouided of them from <hi>Rome,</hi> when the diuiſion of great Pariſhes, and, by conſequence, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of their gaine was in queſtion, oppoſed themſelues by the fauour of the Pope, ſo that nothing could bee done herein, without going to <hi>Rome:</hi> which when it hapned, eſpecially beyond the Mountaines, in regard of the impediments of <hi>Appeales,</hi> and other ſuites, it was a thing of great charge. To prouide againſt theſe inconueniences in Councell, the Prelates thought, that where one Church was ſufficient for a people, but not one Rector, the titles ſhould not bee multiplied, becauſe where many Curates are, there muſt needes be diuerſitie of opinions; but that the Biſhop ſhould compell the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Prieſt to take other Prieſts to aſſiſt him, as many as were needefull: but where the largeneſſe of the habitations did require, hee ſhould haue power to erect a new pariſh Church, diuiding the people and reuenewes, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling them to make a ſufficient reuenew by contribution. Only <hi>Euſtathius Bellai,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who came not long before, told them, that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t part, the Decree would not be receiued in <hi>France,</hi> where they doe not conſent that the Laitie may be commanded, in a temporall matter,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:17208:259"/>
by Eccleſiaſticall authoritie, and that it was not for the reputation of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell to make decrees, which would be reiected in any Prouince. Fryar <hi>Thomas Caſellus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caua,</hi> replyed, that the French men doe not know that this power is giuen to the Councell by CHRIST and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who haue commanded that maintenance ſhould bee allowed by the people, to thoſe that ſerue them in ſpirituall things, and that the French-men, if they will be Chriſtians, muſt obey. <hi>Bellay</hi> replyed, that vntill hee had vnderſtood that which CHRIST and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doe grant to the Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to bee a power to receiue maintenance from him that doth voluntarily giue it, and not to conſtraine any to giue; and that <hi>France</hi> would euer bee Chriſtian. And he paſſed no further.</p>
            <p>The ſixth and eighth Articles would not haue needed a decree, if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had kept their authoritie, or if it had continued in the Pariſh Prieſts, or in the people, to whom ſuch prouiſions did formerly belong, as hath been ſaid, and ſhould doe ſtill by all reaſon. But the neceſsitie of handling theſe matters proceeded from the reſeruations made to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Prelats were all of the ſame opinion, that prouiſions were requiſite, yet ſome would not conſent they ſhould bee made, becauſe they would not m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ddle with the Popes authoritie; by treating of things reſerued to that Sea, eſpecially in ſo great a number. <hi>Leonard,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lanciano,</hi> ſpake of it as of a poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that all the offices of the Apoſtolike <hi>Chancerie</hi> being ſold, it was not fit to diminiſh the diſpatches made there, becauſe it would take away part of the profit, without the conſent of the buyer; and therefore that theſe prouiſions ought to bee made in <hi>Rome,</hi> where the intereſt of all would bee conſidered. And this Biſhop would haue proceeded further, in regard of the intereſts himſelfe and his friends had in thoſe offices, if the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Meſsina,</hi> a Spaniard, who ſate next, had not told him that nothing ſhould be reſolued before it were conſulted of, and conſented to in <hi>Rome.</hi> They called to minde that which was done in the firſt Councell, when authoritie was giuen to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, concerning things reſerued to the Pope; that is, to adde, that they ſhould doe it as delegates of the Apoſtolike Sea; which counſell was follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in all decrees, made concerning ſuch matters.</p>
            <p>In the 7. though euery one thought fit that the people ſhould bee ſerued by perſons ſufficient for the miniſtery, and of good behauiour, yet they ſaid it was enough, and very much, to prouide for the future, becauſe thoſe lawes which looke backe and diſpoſe of things paſt, are euer accounted odious, and tranſcendent. Therefore they thought it ſufficient to prouide fit perſons for hereafter, tolerating thoſe who are in poſſeſſion already. The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Granata</hi> ſaid, that the deputation of any vnfit perſon to the miniſtery of CHRIST, was not ratified by his diuine Maieſtie: and therefore was void the poſſeſſor hauing no right: and that they were bound to remoue him that was vnfit, and to put another ſufficient perſon in his place. But this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not followed, as being too rigid, and impoſſible to be executed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was not a iuſt meaſure of neceſſarie ſufficiencie. Therefore the middle way was taken, not to exceed the propoſition of the Article, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a difference betweene the ignorant and ſcandalous, to proceede againſt the former with leſſe rigour, as being leſſe culpable. And as it belongeth to
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:17208:260"/>
the Biſhop by all reaſon, to make prouiſion when the collations came not from the Pope, ſo, in this caſe alſo it ſhould bee graunted vnto him, as <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> of the Apoſtolike Sea.</p>
            <p>To treat of the viſitation of Benefices commended, in the ninth article, occaſion was giuen by a good vſe, degenerated into a great abuſe. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> make vpon the Weſterne Empire, it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the Churches were depriued of their paſtours, when thoſe vnto <note place="margin">How Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendaes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</note> whom it did canonically belong to make prouiſion of ſucceſſors, could not doe it, as being hindred by inuaſiont, ſieges, or impriſonments: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the people might not continue long without ſpirituall gouernment, the principall Prelats of the Prouince, or ſome of the neighbours, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the Church to ſome Cleargie man, conſpicuous for pietie, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, and fit for gouernment, vntill, the impediments being remooued, a Paſtor might be canonically elected. The Biſhops and next pariſh Prieſts did the like, when the like vacancies hapned in the Countries; and alwayes he that did commend another, did ſeeke to imploy a man of note, and he that was commended, did labour to anſwere the expectation; ſo that great fruit did enſue, to the ſatisfaction of al: But as alwaies ſome corruption wil in time creep into good things, ſome of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendataries began to think not only of doing the Church good, but to draw ſome profit to themſelues alſo, &amp; the Prelats likewiſe to commend Churches without neceſſitie. The abuſe increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, a Law was made, that the <hi>Commenda</hi> ſhould not laſt aboue ſixe moneths, nor the Commendatarie participate of the fruits of the Benefice co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended. Howſoeuer, the Popes, pretended to be aboue this law, did not only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend for a longer time, and grant an honeſt portion to the <hi>Commendatarie,</hi> but did commend alſo for terme of life, granting all the fruits vnto the perſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as vnto the <hi>titular.</hi> Yea, they made the forme alſo quite contrary. For whereas it was formerly ſaid in the Buls, We doe recommend vnto thee this Church, that it may be well gouerned in the <hi>interim:</hi> they began to ſay, We recommend vnto thee ſuch a Church, that thou mayeſt maintaine thy ſtate, with a greater dignitie. And moreouer they ordained, that if the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatarie</hi> died, the Benefice ſhould remaine at their diſpoſition, ſo that they could not be hindred by the Patron. And the <hi>Commendataries</hi> being placed by the Pope, the Biſhops could not meddle in thoſe churches, and euery one in Court was more willing to get Benefices in <hi>Commenda,</hi> then in the Title to exempt themſelues from the ſubiection of the ſuperiour Prelates; ſo that the Biſhop was depriued of authoritie ouer the greater part of the Churches of his Dioceſſe, and the <hi>Commendataries,</hi> not ſubiect to any Superintenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, ſuffering the buildings to fall, and diminiſhing, or wholly taking away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſarie expenſes, hauing no other end, then according to the proëme of the Bull, to maintaine their owne ſtate, let all goe to deſolation. It ſeemed an indecencie, that the Biſhop ſhould meddle with that which was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Pope to another and therefore they thought fit to make a manerly prouiſion againſt this diſorder, granting the Biſhops authoritie to viſit and ſuperintend, but as <hi>Delegates</hi> of his Holineſſe.</p>
            <p>The twelfth propoſition was made to remedie the abuſes of the Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, <note place="margin">The abuſes and impieties of Collectors.</note> becauſe the ancient inſtitution was degenerated alſo. For Hoſpitals,
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:17208:260"/>
Spittles, places for education of Orphans, and ſuch like, beeing inſtituted in diuers places for neceſſitie, without any maintenance but the armes of the faithfull, ſome godly perſons vndertooke the charge to goe about and aske them at mens houſes, and for their credit, had letters teſtimoniall from the Biſhop. Others, that they might not be hindred by the Biſhop, obtained fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie from the Pope, with letters of recommendation; which were eaſily granted, in regard of the profit which came to the Court, for the diſpatch of the buls. This inſtitution was immediatly turned into exceſſiue abuſes, and the leaſt part of the armes collected was beſtowed in the right courſe. Thoſe alſo who had obtained power to collect, did ſubſtitute alſo baſe and infamous perſons, diuiding the almes with them. The Collectours likewiſe, to gaine as much as they could, vſed a thouſand ſacrilegious and wicked artifices, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a certaine forme of habite, carrying fire, water, belles, and other inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to make a noiſe, that they might amaze the vulgar and breed ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them, telling falſe miracles, preaching falſe <hi>indulgences,</hi> asking almes with imprecations and threats of euill and miſfortunes, againſt thoſe that would not giue, and vſing many other impieties like to theſe, ſo that the world was much ſcandalized; but no prouiſion could be made, in regard of the Apoſtolicall grants. The Prelats enlarged themſelues in this matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the abuſes and impieties aforeſaid, and many more, ſhewing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies had beene formerly vſed, but without effect; and ſo would all others prooue that ſhould be attempted: onely one remained, which was to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh wholly the name and vſe of Collectors; in which opinion all concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. At this time the Ambaſſadours of the Duke of <hi>Banaria</hi> came, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <note place="margin">The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of the Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria</hi> conteſt for preceed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Pope vnderſtanding how the voyces were giuen in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning reſidencie, and that the Spaniards did all hold together, made a bad Prognoſtique, and thought that vnion could not be without the Kings knowledge.

               </note> that the <hi>

The Concluſion of all his diſcourſes was, that if the Princes will abandon him, he will haue recourſe to heauen; that hee had a million of golde, and knew where to get another; and beſides, that God wil prouide for his Church. The Court alſo did perceiue, with great paſſion, in what danger they were, and thought that theſe nouities did aime to make many Popes, or none at all, and to hinder all the profits of the offices of the <hi>Chancerie.</hi> Aduice came to him alſo, from his <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that the King was ill pleaſed with the <hi>(Proponentibus Legatis)</hi> conſtituted in the firſt Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and the Pope was ſo much the more pleaſed with it, becauſe by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte of others, he perceiued they had deſſeignes to propoſe ſomething to his preiudice. Yet he cauſed it to be excuſed to the King, that it was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his priuitie, howſoeuer he thought it neceſſary to repreſſe the petulancie of vnquiet ſpirits, ſaying, that the Councel would be like the tower of <hi>Babel,</hi>
               <pb n="502" facs="tcp:17208:261"/>
if euery turbulent perſon might mooue humours as he liſted; that the Legats were diſcreet, and did reuerence his Maieſtie, and would propoſe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhould pleaſe him, and giue ſatisfaction to all wiſe and godly perſons. But with the Kings Ambaſſadour reſiding with him, who ſpake thereof, hee proceeded ſomewhat roughly. Firſt, he complained, that he had done bad offices herein; then, relating how the Spaniſh Prelats, as it were ſeditiouſly, proceeded in the Councell, he ſhewed that the Decree was holy and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, and that no preiudice was done to any, inſaying that the Legats ſhall propoſe. <hi>Vargas</hi> anſwered, that if it had beene ſayd onely, the Legats ſhall propoſe, no man would haue complained, but that ablatiue <hi>(Proponentibus Legatis)</hi> did depriue the Biſhops of power to propoſe; and therefore that it was fit to change it into another kinde of ſpeech. Whereunto the Pope an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, with ſome diſdaine, that he had ſomething elſe to doe, then to thinke <hi>Cuius generis, &amp; cuius caſus.</hi> The Popes ſuſpition did not want ground, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing diſcouered that the Ambaſſadour had ſent many poſts into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and vnto <hi>Trent,</hi> exhorting the Spaniſh Prelats to maintaine their libertie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firing the King that the Councel might not be helde in ſubiection.</p>
            <p>But, in the Court, many Prelates hauing written to their friends from <hi>Trent</hi> diuerſly, according to their affections, there was a great tumult, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an aſtoniſhment, euery one thinking hee did already ſee <hi>Rome</hi> emptie of Prelates, and depriued of all prerogatiue and emine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cie. It did appeare plainely, that the Cardinals reſiding in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould bee excluded from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Biſhoprickes; that pluralitie of benefices was forbid, that no Biſhop or Curate might haue any office in <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the Pope might not bee able to diſpence in any of the things aforeſaid, which are the moſt principall of all that are in his power, ſo that his authoritie would bee much dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. And they remembred the ſaying of <hi>Liuie,</hi> that <hi>the Maiestie of a Prince is hardly brought from the height to the middle, but is eaſily cast headlong from the middle to the bottome.</hi> They diſcourſed how much the authoritie of Biſhops would bee inlarged, who would draw vnto them the collation of Benefices, denying the Popes authoritie for reſeruations, that the Biſhops beyond the Mountaines, and ſome Italians alſo, haue euer ſhewed a bad minde towards the Court, for enuie, and becauſe they can not ſo eaſily haue place in it; and that they were to take heede of thoſe who remanie in places the moſt remote from <hi>Rome,</hi> for conſcience ſake, becauſe they would doe worſe then all the reſt, in caſe they were able; that theſe hypoctiticall Purſtans haue a greater ambition then the reſt, though couered, and would faine aduance themſelues by the ruines of others, as <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth did very well ſhew by effects. And becauſe the Spaniards were vnited in this, and exhorted by <hi>Vargas</hi> to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere, many did whiſper that the King was the firſt moouer, who, to gaine Subſidies from the Clergie, hauing two difficulties to ouercome, one in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Popes conſent, the other in taking away the reſiſtance made by Chapters and Colledges, who being the prime of the Nobilitie, exempted from Biſhops, &amp; moſt of them hauing receiued Benefices by the Popes colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doe oppoſe themſelues without reſpect, did purpoſe to aduance the Biſhops who doe wholly depend on him, and receiue their Biſhoprickes by his preſentation, by freeing of them from ſubiection to the Pope, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:17208:261"/>
the Chapters and Colledges vnto them, and ſo, by their meanes; to gaine an eaſie and abſolute dominion ouer the Clergie.</p>
            <p>The Court did generally complaine of all the Legats for propoſing the article, or ſuffering it to be propoſed, ſaying, that it was formerly ordained with great arte, that they onely ſhould propoſe, onely to reſiſt the attemps of thoſe who were ill affected to <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they could not bee excuſed, becauſe they had an example of a diſorder, which this diſpute cauſed in the firſt Councel. Aboue all, they complained of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Seripando,</hi> and eſpecially of <hi>Mantua,</hi> becauſe with his reputation and credit, he might eaſily haue withſtood all inconueniences. They ſayd it was neceſſarie to other Legats, more inclined to the common good, not Princes, nor Fryars, but ſuch as had paſſed through the degrees of the Court. And the generall voyce did deſſeigne <hi>Iohn Baptista Cigala,</hi> Card. of S. <hi>Clement,</hi> in the firſt place, becauſe he had ſhewed himſelfe a ſtout champion for the Popes authoritie, in the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of <hi>Referendarie</hi> and <hi>Auditor</hi> of the <hi>Chamber,</hi> with much commendation and encreaſe of the affaires of <hi>Rome;</hi> who, being ſuperiour to <hi>Mantua,</hi> ought to holde the firſt place, which would make him retire.</p>
            <p>The Pope cauſed many congregations to bee held by the Cardinals, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to conſult of the affaires of the Councell: who hauing thought of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers remedies to ſtop the current of this euill, he began to ſpeake of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes much more quietly and correctly then before. Hee did not condemne the opinion of thoſe who ſaid, that reſidencie was <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> yea hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended them for ſpeaking according to their conſcience; and ſometimes he added, that perhaps that opinion was the better. But hee complained of thoſe who referred themſelues vnto him, becauſe the Councell was aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that euery one may deliuer his owne opinion, and not lay the things of difficultie vpon the backe of another, that themſelues might auoid ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and enuie. The differences betweene his Legates did diſpleaſe him, which they ought not to haue publiſhed, with ſcandall, but, concealing them, to haue compoſed them betweene themſelues, or referred them to him. And as hee was pleaſed that euery one ſhould deliuer his opinion freely, ſo hee blamed the practiſes which many vſed, to ſubuert others, with deceipts, and almoſt with violences. And hee could not chooſe but bee trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with that which was ſpoken concerning the libertie of the Councel and that to conſult of the matters thereof at <hi>Rome</hi> was to violate it; ſaying it was a ſtrange thing, that hee, who was Head of the Church, and the Cardinals, who were principall members, and other Prelates in <hi>Rome,</hi> who haue voyce in the Councell, ſhould bee accounted ſtrangers, and may not bee infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of what is handled, and ſpeake their opinion, whereas thoſe who haue no lawfull part in it, hold it lawfull to entermeddle, and that in an ill ſort; that it is plaine, that the Prelates went to <hi>Trent,</hi> with commiſſion from their Princes, according to which they proceede; that the Ambaſſadours, by letters and perſwaſions, doe compell them to follow the intereſts of their Maſters, and yet, for all this, no man ſaith, which (ſhould be ſayd) that the Councell is not free. This he amplified, in all his diſcourſes, with much vehemencie; adding, that to ſay the Councell was not free, was a coulour v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by him who was not willing to ſee a good end thereof, hoping to diſſolue
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:17208:262"/>
it, or to take from it all reputation; all which he held to be ſecret fauourers of hereſie.</p>
            <p>Finally after he had conferred and often conſulted with all the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours reſiding with him, of this particular, the ninth of May aſſembling all the Cardinals, hee cauſed the aduices ſent from <hi>Trent</hi> to bee read, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſumme of the former conſultations, and the neceſſitie to walke cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly and conſtantly in this buſineſſe, intimating that many had conſpired againſt the Apoſtolike Sea. Afterwards hee cauſed the anſwere to bee read which he purpoſed ſhould be ſent to <hi>Trent;</hi> which in ſubſtance did containe two points. That the Counſell was free on his part, and euer ſhould. <note place="margin">The Popes anſwere ſent to <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> That it was fit he ſhould bee acknowledged for head, and receiue that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which is due to the Apoſtolike Sea. He asked the opinion of all the Cardinals: who did vniformely commend the Anſwere. Some told him that, in regard of the differences betweene the Legats, it were good to ſend others, ſome of the moſt extraordinary perſons; and others ſayd that the importance of the buſines did require that his Holineſſe and the whole Colledge ſhould goe to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> that they may be neere to <hi>Trent,</hi> and to giue better aſſiſtance, as occaſion ſhould be offered. Whereunto the Pope anſwered, that hee was readie to goe, not onely to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> but to <hi>Trent</hi> alſo, if there were neede, and all the Cardinals offered to follow him. They conſulted of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">A Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Rome</hi> about ſending other Legats.</note> other Legates, and reſolued not to ſpeake any more of it, as yet, becauſe <hi>Mantua</hi> would depart, which would bee a great preiudice to the reputation of the Councell, in regard of the opinion which the Emperour, King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and almoſt all Princes haue of his hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and of the credite hee hath with the greater part of the Prelates of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The letters being diſpatched, he dealt with the Ambaſſadours of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Pope maketh plots to maintaine the greatneſſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique Sea.</note> and <hi>Florence,</hi> that their Princes would recommend the cauſe of the Papacie to their Ambaſſadours in <hi>Trent,</hi> and command them to cauſe the Prelates of their States, not to be preſent in the Parlies againſt the Apoſtolique Sea, and not to bee ſo earneſt in the point of Reſidencie. Afterwards hee called all the Biſhops remaining at Court, and ſhewed them what ſeruice their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence might doe in <hi>Trent,</hi> and the neceſſitie thereof. Hee loaded them with promiſes, gaue money to thoſe who were poore, and diſpatched them to the Councel. This hee did to encreaſe the number, againſt they ſhould ſpeake of Reſidencie, and becauſe 40. French-men were expected, from whom he could not Prognoſticate any good. And not to haue <hi>France</hi> his oppoſite, whoſe Ambaſſadours would be in <hi>Trent</hi> very ſhortly, he reſolued to giue the King 100000. crownes, and to lend him as much in the Name of Marchants, vpon ſufficient aſſurance for the principall and the intereſt, ſo that he would in earneſt, and without diſſimulation, reuoke the Edicts, and make warre for religion, that with that money <hi>Suiſſes</hi> and <hi>Germanes</hi> might be leuied to bee vnder the conduct of his Legate, and the collours of the Church, that no <hi>Hugonot</hi> ſhould bee pardoned without his conſent, that the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> and others, to bee named by him, ſhould be impriſoned, that in the Councel nothing ſhould be handled againſt his authority, and that his Ambaſſadours ſhould not make mention of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats.</hi>
               <pb n="505" facs="tcp:17208:262"/>
Yet he promiſed to accord with the King in that matter, and to reforme it, to the ſatisfaction of his Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the Pope conſulted on the point of Reſidence, that, when there was occaſion, hee might ſpeake thereof correctly, without preiudice to himſelfe, or ſcandall to others. And hauing well diſcuſſed the reaſons, hee ſetled his opinion to approoue it, and cauſe it to be executed vpon what <note place="margin">He conſulteth on the point of Reſidence.</note> law ſoeuer it were grounded, whether Canonicall, or Euangelicall. And ſo he anſwered the French Ambaſſadour, who ſpake to him of it; adding, that he alone is deputed to ſee the execution of all the Euangelicall precepts. For CHRIST hauing ſayd to S. <hi>Peter, Feede my Lambes,</hi> hath ordained that all the orders made by his diuine Maieſtie, ſhall be executed by meanes of him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that hee would make a Bull thereof, with a penalty of depriuation of the Biſhoprickes; which ſhould be more feared then a declaration which the Councell might make, <hi>de iure Diuine.</hi> And, the Ambaſſadour inſiſting vpon the liberty of the Councell, hee ſaid, that, if all liberty were graunted vnto it, they would extend it to reforme not onely the Pope, but Secular Princes alſo. And this forme of ſpeech much pleaſed his Holineſſe, who was wont to ſay, that nothing was worſe then to ſtand vpon the defence onely, and that, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did threaten him with the Councell, hee would play with them at the ſame weapons.</p>
            <p>At this time, to begin to execute that which hee had requeſted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <note place="margin">And reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Court in petty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters onely.</note> that is, to reforme the Court, that the Councell might not meddle with it, he firſt publiſhed a reformation of the <hi>Penitentiary,</hi> a very principall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, giuing out a report, that hee would ſhortly alſo reforme the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> and the <hi>Chamber.</hi> Euery one did expect that the things belonging to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of ſoules ſhould haue beene regulated, which are managed in that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but in the Bull there was not any the leaſt mention made of repentance, conſcience, or any other ſpirituall thing: onely it tooke away the <hi>Faculties</hi> which the <hi>Penitentiary</hi> doth exerciſe, in diuers cauſes beneficiall, belonging to the exterior diſcipline of regular Friars; not expreſſing whether that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion was made to giue thoſe <hi>Faculties</hi> to ſome other officers, or whether hee eſteemed them abuſes vndecent, and would baniſh them from <hi>Rome.</hi> But the euent did immediatly take away the doubt. For the ſame things were obtained from the <hi>Datary,</hi> and by other wayes, onely with greater charge. And this was the fruit of the reformation.</p>
            <p>But to returne to <hi>Trent,</hi> the Fathers hauing deliuered their opinions, and the deputies framed nine Decrees (for the Articles of Matrimonie, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready decided, and of reſidencie by conſent of the Legats, and of ſome of the Fathers, perſwaded thereunto, were omitted) they propoſed them to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in Congregation, and to bee read in the Seſſion at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. By reaſon of this omiſſion, the demands of thoſe that fauoured reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency <note place="margin">Another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendon about Reſidence.</note> were ſtirred vp. Wherunto the Legats anſwering, that that Article was not wel diſcuſſed, nor was fit to be propoſed in that Seſſion, but that it ſhould bee done in time conuenient, they were more earneſt then before, alleadging that there would neuer bee a greater opportunitie, murmuring that it was a tricke neuer to conclude it. But they were forced to relent, ſeeing the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates reſolute not to handle it then, and becauſe thoſe of the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:17208:263"/>
encouraged from <hi>Rome,</hi> did labour more effectually to the contrarie. Therefore ſpeaking of the other Articles onely, with ſome few alterations, the nine heads were framed.</p>
            <p>The Maquis of <hi>Peſcara</hi> made earneſt ſuite, in the Kings name, that that Councel might be declared to be a Continuation of the Councell begun vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Paul</hi> 3. and proſecuted vnder <hi>Iulius.</hi> He was aſſiſted by the Spaniſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, <note place="margin">The Spaniſh Ambaſſadour maketh ſiut to haue the Continuation declared.</note> and others, who followed them, alleadging that it was to be done, for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of faith; and that otherwiſe the determinations, already made, would be queſtioned, which would be a notable impiety. The Emperours Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors vſed ſtrong perſwaſions to the contrary, ſaying they would preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part <note place="margin">And is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Emperours Ambaſſadors.</note> &amp; proteſt. For the Emperor hauing giuen his word to <hi>Germany,</hi> that that <hi>Conuocation</hi> ſhould be a new Councel, he could not indure ſo great an affront. They ſaid they would not by this meanes, reexamine the things decided, but that while there was hope to reduce <hi>Germany,</hi> they would not cut it off, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with ſo much diſgrace of the Emperor. Card. <hi>Seripando</hi> had no other aime but that it ſhould be determined to be a continuation, &amp; formerly, in making the Bul of the Conuocation, did labour therein, &amp; did now effectually further the Spaniards requeſt. But <hi>Mantua</hi> did conſtantly reſiſt, that ſuch an iniurie might not be done to the Emperor, without neceſſitie; and he found a temper to pacifie the Spaniards; ſaying, that hauing already held 2. Seſſions without making mention of this propoſition, it will be no preiudice to deferre it alſo to another. The reſolution of the Emperors Ambaſſadors to depart, and the perſwaſion of the Card. cauſed <hi>Peſcara</hi> to proceed more rimiſly. And letters came very fitly from <hi>Lewis de Lanſac,</hi> chiefe of the Ambaſſadours ſent to the Councel from the French King, who, beeing in his voyage not farre diſtant, wrote to the Legats and Fathers, to pray them that the Seſſion might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued, vntil he &amp; his Colleagues were come. <hi>Mantua,</hi> making vſe of this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, propoſed the prorogation of the Seſſion, for which though they would not conſent, in regard of maintaining the dignity of the Synod, yet they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (ſome for one reſpect, ſome for another, and ſome becauſe the humors of reſidence were not wel quieted) to celebrate it, without propoſing any thing.</p>
            <p>The 14. day being come, they met in the publike Seſſion, with the vſuall <note place="margin">A Seſſion is held.</note> Ceremonies: where the Maſſe and the prayers accuſtomed being ended, the Secretary read the <hi>Mandats</hi> of Princes, according to the order in which the Ambaſſadors preſented themſelues in Congregation: Of the Catholike king, of the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> of the <hi>Suiſses,</hi> of the Clergie of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians.

the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> was between <hi>Milan</hi> and them, many beleeued, that he had commiſſion from his King ſo to doe, who, deſirous that the Councell ſhould proceed, would not haue it interrupted by the controuerſie of precedence, which could not haue been auoided, if his, and the French Ambaſſadors had been in <hi>Trent</hi> together. <hi>Lewis S Gelais,</hi> Lord of <hi>Lanſac,</hi> chiefe of the French Ambaſſage, arriued two dayes after the departure of the other, and was met <note place="margin">The French Ambaſſadors come to <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> vpon the way by many of the Prelats, and partieularly by the Spaniards. The next day <hi>Arnold de Ferrieres,</hi> Preſident of <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Guido Faber,</hi> Lord of <hi>Pibrac,</hi> gowned men, Colleagues of the Ambaſſage, did ariue alſo.</p>
            <p>At this time aduice came to the Councell how the Pope, Cardinals, and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> had cenſured the Fathers for the point of Reſidence, and many receiued letters from the Cardinals their Patrons, full of complaints, <note place="margin">The Popes indignation againſt the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> is renewed.</note> reprehenſions, and exhortations, which letters they ſhewed to many. On the other ſide, newes came to <hi>Rome</hi> of what hapened in <hi>Trent</hi> afterwards. The Pope did renew and augment his diſdaine againſt the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> for hauing omitted the occaſion to declare the Continuation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requeſtd to doe it by the Ambaſſadour and Prelates of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Hee was ſory to ſee that Cardinall ioyned with the Spaniads in the point of reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and oppoſite to them in the Continuation; which was to croſſe him in all things. For no man, though of a dull wit, would haue forborne to haue made that declaration, becauſe if it had ſucceeded well, it had beene much in the fauour of the Catholique Church, if not, the Councell had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued; a thing of no leſſe benefite. They began in <hi>Rome</hi> to conſult againe of ſending other Legats, and particularly the Cardinall of Saint <hi>Clement;</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to lay the principall charge, and the inſtruction vpon him: and not to take the firſt place from <hi>Mantua,</hi> and ſo to giue him occaſion to depart, they thought to ordaine him Biſhop, newes being come a little before of the death of <hi>Francis Tornon,</hi> Deane, by which one of the ſixe Biſhoprickes was voyde.</p>
            <p>The Emperour, aduertiſed of the propoſition to declare the <hi>Continuation,</hi> was mooued, and ſent the Pope word, that whenſoeuer it was done, hee would recall his Ambaſſadours from <hi>Trent,</hi> whom he commanded, that, if the reſolution were made, they ſhould preſently depart, not expecting the publication. Therefore his Holineſſe was in hope that, by this meanes the Councel might be ended, and was ſo much the more angry with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> for ſuffering ſuch an occaſion to paſſe, and beganne to thinke how it might bee reuiued. The Court, as well to imitate their Prince, as for their owne intereſts, continued their complaints, and murmures againſt the Prelates of the Councell, and moſt of all againſt that Cardinall, and againſt <hi>Seripando</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armienſe;</hi> and, on the contrary, the Prelates in <hi>Trent,</hi> and eſpecially the Spaniards, complayned of the Pope and the Court.

<pb n="508" facs="tcp:17208:264"/>
exempt from all preuention, concurrence, and interceſſion of any other power; and yet lawes are giuen them what to handle, and limitations, and corrections made of the things handled and decreed; which continuing, they cannot truely bee called a Councell. That there were amongſt them more then fourtie ſtipendaries of the pope, ſome receiuing thirtie, ſome ſixtie crownes a moneth; and that others were terrified by the letters of Cardinals, and other Courtiers. They complained of the Court, that, not induring a reformation, they held it lawfull to calumniate, reprehend, and cenſure that which was done for the ſeruice of God. That, hauing ſeene how they proceeded againſt a neceſſarie and ſmall reformation, they muſt needes expect a great commotion, and contradiction, when they ſhall be more touched at the quicke; that the Pope ought to bridle the tongues of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, and make ſhew at the leaſt, ſeeing that hee would not beetied really, that the councell may proceed with ſinceritie and libertie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paulus Emilius Verallus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Capoccio,</hi> came to bad termes with the Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> in a meeting of many Biſhops. For <hi>Paris</hi> hauing diſliked <note place="margin">A paſſage co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the equality of Biſhops.</note> the courſe of determining by pluralitie of voyce, and the other anſwering that all Biſhops were equall, <hi>Paris</hi> asked him how many ſoules were vnder his charge; who anſwered that he had fiue hundred: then <hi>Paris</hi> replied, that, in regard of his perſon, he yeelded vnto him, but in reſpect of thoſe who were repreſented by the one and the other, hee that ſpake of fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, ought not to bee made equall to him that ſpake of fiue hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</p>
            <p>Things ſtanding in theſe termes, there was no Congregation made vntill the 20. day: in which the French Ambaſſadours (who had imparted their inſtructions to the Imperialiſts, and held correſpondence, according to the <note place="margin">The French Ambaſſadors are receiued in congregation, and one of them maketh an Oration.</note> command of their Maſter) preſented themſelues. The <hi>Mandat</hi> of their Ambaſſage beeing exhibited and read, <hi>Guide Faber</hi> made a long Oration, in which, hauing expounded the continuall deſire of the King, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ſhould be aſſembled in a fit place, not ſuſpected, and the requeſt hee had made to the Pope and all Chriſtian Princes for it, hee told them what fruite might bee expected from the opening of it. Hee added, that as thoſe doe much erre who would innouate all therites of the Church ſo to maintaine all of them obſtinately, not conſidering the ſtate of the preſent times, and the publike good, deſerueth no leſſe reprehenſion. Hee declared very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the temptations which the Deuill would vſe, to diuert the Fathers from the right way, ſaying, that if they gaue eare to him, they would make Councels loſe all authoritie; adding, that many Councels haue been held in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> with no fruit, or very little, of which it was ſayd that they were neither free nor lawfull, becauſe they were gouerned by the will of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; that they ought to bee carefull to vſe well the power and liberty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them by God. For if, in priuate cauſes, they deſerue ſeuere puniſhment, who doe gratifie any man againſt iuſtice, they deſerue it much more, who, being iudges in cauſes diuine, doe follow a popular applauſe, or ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be made gowned ſlaues to the Princes, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are obliged; and ſaid that euery one ſhould examine himſelfe what paſſion doth poſſeſſe him. And becauſe the defects of ſome former Synodes haue made a preiudice to
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:17208:264"/>
this, it is fit to ſhew that thoſe things are paſt, that euery one may diſpute without being burned, that publike faith is not broken, that the holy Ghoſt is to be called for from heauen onely, and that this is not that Councel which was begunne by <hi>Paul</hi> 3. and proſecuted by <hi>Iulius</hi> 3. in turbulent times, and in the midſt of armes which was diſſolued without doing any thing that was good, but a new free, peaceable, and lawfull Councell, called according to the ancient cuſtome, to which all Kings, Princes, and Republiques, doe giue conſent, to which <hi>Germany</hi> will runne and bring with the authors of the new diſputes, the moſt graue and eloquent men which it hath. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that they the Ambaſſadours did promiſe, to this end, the aſſiſtance of the King. It ſeemed that ſome of the Fathers, and of the Legates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, did not take thoſe words well, to which the <hi>Speaker</hi> not knowing <note place="margin">To which the <hi>Speaker</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not what anſwer to make.</note> what to anſwere, nor what complement to make, the Congregation ended with the Oration.</p>
            <p>The next day, the ſame Ambaſſadours went to the Legats, aſſembled for that purpoſe, where they excuſed the French Prelates for not comming, in regard of the tumults, promiſing that when they were ended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they hoped <note place="margin">The French Ambaſſadors demand of the Legates a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that the Councel is new.</note> they would be ſhortly, they ſhould come with ſpeed. Afterwards they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> doe ſuſpect the <hi>continuation</hi> of the Councel, and doe require a new, that the King had treated heereof with the Emperour, who deſired the ſame, at the inſtance of the <hi>Confeſsioniſts;</hi> that hee had demanded the ſame alſo of the Pope: who anſwered that the difference was onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them and the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and that it concerned not him, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it to the Councel. Therefore they demanded a declaration, in plaine termes, that the <hi>Indication</hi> is new, and not in theſe words, <hi>Indicendo continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, &amp; continuando indicimus,</hi> which is an ambiguity not befitting Chriſtians, and implieth a contradiction; and ſaid, that the Decrees already made by the Councell, are not receiued by the French Church, nor by the Pope himſelfe, and that <hi>Henry</hi> 2. did proteſt againſt it: that concerning this point, they were addreſſed to them the Legates, becauſe the Pope hath often ſaid that the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of <hi>Indiction</hi> or <hi>continuation</hi> was not his, and that hee referred it to the Councel. And hauing deliuered this petition by word, they left it alſo in writing. The Legats, after they had conſulted together, anſwered in writing alſo, that they admitted the excuſe of the Biſhops abſent, but that they could <note place="margin">To whom the Legats an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> not deferre the diſcuſſion of that which was to bee handled in the Councel vntill their comming, becauſe the Fathers who were preſent, would bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated too much, that they haue not power to declare that the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of the Councel is new but to preſide onely, according to the tenour of the Popes Bul, and the will of the Synode. The French-men were conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the anſwere for the preſent, hauing determined, together with the Imperialiſts, not to proceed further, ſo long as in the acts mention was not made of <hi>continuation,</hi> conſidering that the Spaniards hauing made requeſts in the firſt Seſſion that the <hi>continuation</hi> ſhould be declared, and receiued much contradiction, there was danger that the Councel would haue been diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But the anſwere of the Legats publiſhed by the French men, that their authority was to preſide according to the will of the Synode made the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards ſay, that thoſe words did ſubiect the Legates to the Councel, whereas
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:17208:265"/>
indeed they made themſelues Lords ouer it. And <hi>Granata</hi> ſaid, that it was an abſolute dominion to make vſe of the quality of a ſeruant, and of a Lord alſo.</p>
            <p>The Legats propoſing nothing for the next Seſſion, the Prelats, who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured reſidencie, beganne to diſcourſe againe of it, and perſwaded the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of the Emperour, Kings of <hi>France, Portugal,</hi> and all the others, to mooue the Legats, that it might be decided in the next Seſſion; alleadging, <note place="margin">The Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards require a determination in the point of Reſidence.</note> that it hauing beene propoſed and diſputed, it would bee a great ſcandall to leaue it vndecided, and would ſhew that it was for ſome particular intereſt, ſeeing that the principall. Prelats of the Councel, and the greater number did deſire the determination of it. The French men, together with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts, made inſtance that the points of doctrine might not bee handled <note place="margin">The Miniſters of the French King &amp; Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror demand of the Legats that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> points of doctrine may be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vntill the comming of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> in abſence of the Proteſtants who doe impugne them, vntill their contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie be manifeſt, in regard the diſputation is ſuperfluous, where there is none to contradict, eſpecially there being matter enough beſides, in which the world doth agree, that is, a good reformation of manners; that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadour in <hi>France</hi> had declared, that his Queene would ſend to the Councell; whence it would follow that the other Proteſtants would do the like; ſo that a generall reunion of the Church would ſucceed: and that one might aſſure himſelfe to ſee this effected, if a good reformation were made. Cardinall <hi>Simoneta</hi> anſwered this ſecond propoſition, that the buſineſſe ſeemed eaſie, but was not ſo, becauſe all conſiſted in the diſpoſition of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, in which the abuſes proceed from Kings and Princes. This trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled all the Ambaſſadours, becauſe of the nominations, and diſpoſitions which Princes do exerciſe, and eſpecially the French King. But the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Reſidence did moleſt the Legats more; nor were the Fathers pacified with the excuſes formerly vſed, that the matter was not ſufficiently digeſted, that there was not time enough before the Seſſion to make it cleere, and for other conſiderations. And the heate grew ſo great, that ſome of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltramontans</hi> were agreed to proteſt, and depart. And this was the cauſe of ſtopping the motion. For the Ambaſſadors, fearing that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell would be interrupted, and knowing that the Pope would cheriſh euery occaſion, ceaſed to make any further inſtance, and perſwaded the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to he contented to expect; and, for the ſame cauſe, they laboured with <note place="margin">But they doe all ſurceaſe, becauſe the Pope would take occaſion hereby to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue the Councel.</note> the Miniſters of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that they ſhould not inſiſt any more to haue the <hi>continuation</hi> declared: who not onely were pacified, but proteſted alſo to the Legats, that they did not then demaund it; ſaying, that, if others ſeeke to put the Councell into the ſtocke, there is no reaſon their purpoſe ſhould be couered with the cloake of the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> The <hi>proteſtation</hi> pleaſed the Legats, who were ingaged by their word to the <hi>Marquis,</hi> and knew not how to acquite themſelues. Neither was it leſſe gratefull to them to deferre the point of Reſidence; and, that none might change opinion, they drew a writing, which they read in Congregation, that it might there be approued, that in the next Seſſion they ſhould doe nothing but deferre theſe matters vntill another, and that for good reſpects: and they thought they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened of two great weights. The Seſſion approching, many who thought themſelues much pricked with the oration of the French Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour,
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:17208:265"/>
deſired the Legats to make a ſound anſwere, when the <hi>Mandate</hi> was read in the Seſſion; and Cardinall <hi>Altemps</hi> did perſwade, that by all meanes it ſhould bee ſo, ſaying that the inſolencie of that Palace man was to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, who was accuſtomed to ſpeake to meane people. The charge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was giuen to 10. <hi>Baptiſta Caſtello,</hi> the Speaker, with order onely to defend the dignity of the Synode, without touching any mans perſon.</p>
            <p>The Pope, after long conſultation, reſolued that the Continuation ſhould <note place="margin">The Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth that the <hi>continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ſhall be declared; but ſoone after waueth his opinion.</note> be declared; let the Emperour doe what he could; thinking that it muſt needs ſucceede well: and diſpatched a Currier to <hi>Trent</hi> with this Commiſſion. This, being arriued the ſecond of Iune, troubled the Legates very much, in regard of the confuſions which they ſaw would ariſe, and of the diſorder in which the Councell was; and all reſoluing vniformely to informe the Pope better ſignifying vnto him the things that haue been handled, and the Decree already publiſhed, and ſhewing him the impoſſibilitie to performe his order, the Cardinall <hi>Altemps,</hi> who before had leaue to goe to <hi>Rome</hi> for other cauſes, went away by poſt the next day, to deliuer the meſſage in perſon. But at night another Currier came with letters, that his Holineſſe did refer all to the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and iudgement of the Legats.</p>
            <p>The fourth of Iune being come, the Seſſion was celebrated, with the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall <note place="margin">The Seſſion is celebrated; in which the <hi>Speaker</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the ocation of <hi>Pibrac.</hi>

Which being done the <hi>Speaker</hi> made an anſwere; and ſaid, that there was hope prouiſion would be made againſt all the diſorders of Chriſtendome, by the remedie, which the Pope thought neceſſary, that is, this Councell, begun by the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, and conſent of Princes; amongſt whom the French King hath ſent men of conſcience and religion, to offer not onely aſſiſtance, but obedience alſo to this Synod, which doth not leſſe deſerue it then other Councels, againſt which ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted perſons haue falſely oppoſed, that they haue not been lawfull, not true, though men of pietie haue euer held them to be Councels, hauing beene called by him that hath authoritie, howſoeuer calumnies haue beene ſpread by others, that they were not free; againſt which, as alſo againſt the preſent Synode, the treacheries of Sathan copiouſly and acutely repeated by them, the Ambaſſadours, did not preuaile; that the Councell will not make a bad interpretation of their diligent and free admonition not to regard popular applauſe, or follow the will of Princes, but as it doth eſteeme it not to bee neceſſary, or rather to bee ſuperfluous, ſo it is willing to beleeue that it doth proceed from a good mind, that it may not be forced to ſay any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its mild and pious purpoſe, and vſuall cuſtome. But to free them the Ambaſſadours from that vaine feare, which they would ſeeme to haue, and aſſure them of their true purpoſe, he doth foretell them that the effects will ſhew that the Councell will poſtpoſe the deſires, will, and power of who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer to her owne dignitie and authoritie; and promiſeth to King <hi>Charles</hi> what it is able to doe, ſauing faith and religion, for preſeruation of his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, kingdome, and ſtate.

And there were 35. Prelats who deſired that the point of Reſidence ſhould then be handle. Some propoſed alſo that the <hi>continuation</hi> ſhould be declared, which was thought to be done, to raiſe ſome tumults, to make the Councell diſſolue. For they were of thoſe who were moſt obliged to <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore did repent that they had ſpoken their opinion ſo freely in the point of Reſidence, ſo much abhorred by the Court.

               </gap> day a generall Congregation was held; to giue order for that <note place="margin">Order giuen for the matter of the next Seſſion.</note> which ſhould be handled in the next Seſſion; and the Articles concerning the communion were propoſed. Whether all the faithfull are neceſſarily, and by Gods Commaundement, bound to receiue both kinds in that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Whether the Church doth vpon good ground communicate the <hi>Laiques</hi> with the bread onely, or hath erred heerein? Whether all CHRIST and all his graces are receiued as well vnder one kind as vnder both? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reaſons which haue mooued the Church to giue to the Laitie the Communion of the bread onely, ought to induce it alſo, not to graunt the Cup to any? If it ſhall appeare that it may bee graunted to ſome for honeſt cauſes, vpon what conditions it may bee done? Whether the Communion be neceſſary for infants, before the vſe of reaſon? The Fathers were deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded if they were pleaſed that that matter ſhould be handled, and whether they would adde any thing vnto it. And although the French Ambaſſadors, and many of the Prelates did thinke fit that the points of doctrine ſhould not be handled, vntill it did appeare whether the Proteſtants would come or not, it being euident, that, in caſe they, ſhould be contumacious, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion would be in vaine, as not neceſſary for the Catholiques, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the others, yet none oppoſed, at the earneſt perſwaſions of the Imperialiſts, who hoped to obtaine the Communion of the Cup; which would be a beginning to giue <hi>Germanie</hi> ſatisfaction. It being reſolued that the ſixe Articles ſhould bee handled, and the Diuines ſpeake firſt, and then the Prelats, it did appeare that all the time vntill the Seſſion would be ſpent in this onely, eighty eight Diuines being to ſpeake, and many Prelats to giue their voyces. Therefore ſome ſaid, that there was no need of any great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to be had of theſe points, becauſe they were fully diſcuſſed in the former aſſembly vnder <hi>Iulius,</hi> but that a briefe and ſound examination might ſerue, ſo that they may bee determined in a few dayes, and all the other time may be ſpent in the reformation. They ſayd that Article of reſidencie had beene already propoſed, and examined in part, and that it was meete that it ſhould once be ended. This opinion was openly followed by thirtie Fathers, and it appeared that it was ſecretly approoued by many more, who would haue ſhewed themſelues in the concluſion. But Cardinall <hi>Simoneta,</hi> deſiring to interpoſe a delay, by ſaying that it was not meete to handle that matter vntill mens mindes were pacified, which had beene mooued by the former difference, which will not ſuffer them to diſcerne the trueth, opened a gate to <hi>Iohn Baptiſta Caſtagna,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Roſano,</hi> and to <hi>Pompeius Zambecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>

Biſhop of <hi>Sulmona;</hi> both which ſpeaking hotly and ſharpely, raiſed ſuch a tumult that they feared ſome inconuenience. For remedy whereof the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> prayed thoſe of the reſidence to be quiet, promiſing, that in another Seſſion, or when they handled the Sacrament of order, this ſhould bee diſcuſſed. The tumult being thus appeaſed, and it appearing, that the reſuming of the points handled vnder <hi>Iulius,</hi> would ſpend more time, and <note place="margin">The Card. of <hi>Mantua</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth that the point of Reſidence ſhal be diſcuſſed.</note> bee more difficult then to examine them againe, as hapneth to a iudge who is to frame his ſentence vpon a proceſſe made before another, a reſolution was taken, that the Diuines ſhould ſpeake of them, and a congregation bee held twice a day, in which two of the Legats ſhould aſſiſt (ſo diuiding their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that they might make an end the ſooner) and of the Prelats as many as would; and that they ſhould haue two dayes to ſtudy, and begin the third. With this concluſion the Congregation ended.

            <p>The next day the Emp. Ambaſſadors hauing obtained, as they deſired, the propoſition of the Chalice, for which vntill then they had proceeded with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, came to the Legats, and preſented to them, according to the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Prince, twenty points of reformation. 1. That the Pope would <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors propoſe to the Legats twenty points of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> bee content to make a iuſt reformation of himſelfe and the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. That if the number of Cardinals cannot be reduced to twelue, yet that it bee brought at the leaſt to the double of it, with two ſupernumerary, ſo that they may not exceede ſixe and twenty. 3. That no ſcandalous diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may bee granted hereafter. 4. That the executions againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawes may be reuoked, and all the monaſteries ſubiected to the Biſhops. 5. That <hi>pluralitie</hi> of Benefices bee taken away, and Schooles erected in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall and Collegiate Churches, and that Eccleſiaſticall offices may not bee bought and ſold. 6 That Biſhops may bee compelled to reſide, and not exerciſe their office by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icars,</hi> and if they bee not ſufficient, that the charge may not bee committed to one <hi>Vicar,</hi> but to many perſons, and that the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Dioeceſan Synods, may bee made euery yeere. 7 That euery Eccleſiaſticall Miniſterie bee exerciſed freely, and that rich Benefices, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cure, may bee incorporated to thoſe that haue cure, and ſmall reuenues. 8. That the Canons againſt Simonie may bee reuiued. 9. That the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall conſtitutions bee abridged, the ſuperfluitie cut off, and not made equall to the obligations of the Law of GOD. 10 That excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bee not vſed but for mortall ſinne, or notorious irregularitie. 11. That Diuine Seruice be ſo ſaid, as that it may bee vnderſtood by him that faith it, and by him that heareth. 12. That the <hi>Breuiaries</hi> and <hi>Miſsals</hi> bee corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and thoſe things taken away which bee not found in the Scripture, as
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:17208:267"/>
alſo the prolixitie. 13. That in celebrating the diuine offices in Latine, prayers bee intermingled in the vulgar. 14 That the Clergie and Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall order bee reformed, according to the ancient inſtitution, and that ſo great riches may not bee adminiſtered ſo ill. 15 That it be conſidered whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be expedient to remit ſo great obligations of the poſitiue Law, abating ſome of the rigour, in the difference of meats and faſts, and granting marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Prieſts to ſome nations. 16. That, to take away the diuerſitie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, the diuers <hi>Poſtils</hi> be forbidden to be read, and one made by publique authoritie, and likewiſe a new <hi>Ritual,</hi> which may bee followed by all. 17. That a way bee found, not to chaſe away bad Pariſh Prieſts, becauſe that is eaſie, but to ſubſtitute better. 18 That in great prouinces many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprickes bee erected, conuerting rich Monaſteries to this vſe. 19. That, for Eccleſiaſticall goods vſurped, perhaps it was better at that time to paſſe them ouer with diſſimulation. In the end to ſay ſomething to pleaſe the Pope, and to pacifie him if hee were angry for theſe propoſitions, he added: 20 That the Legats ſhould endeauour, that no vnprofitable queſtions, which breed ſcandall, as whether Reſidence bee <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> and the like, ſhould bee propoſed; and that the Fathers ſhould ſpeake without choler, and not make themſelues a fable to the aduerſaries. Concerning the 17. they gaue ſome particular notes, to reduce thoſe who were leſt obſtinate amongſt the Sectaries, by ſending them to ſome Vniuerſitie where they may bee inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, in a ſhort time, and giuing order to the Biſhops, who haue no Vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to make a Colledge in the next, for the youth of their Dioceſſes, to make a Catalogue of the Doctours which are to be read in the Schooles, prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that any others be read.</p>
            <p>The propoſitions being vnderſtood, the Legats, retiring firſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting <note place="margin">Who anſwere that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the next Seſsion.</note> together, returned and made anſwere; that it was not poſſible to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them the next Seſſion, hauing, at their inſtance, that matter of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice vpon their hands, of great importance and difficultie; that the things propoſed are diuers, and concerne diuers ſubiects, which cannot be all dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted together; that therefore they would communicate to the Prelates, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions were offered, thoſe which had affinitie with the other reformations. The Ambaſſadours knew that they ſpake this that they might not publiſh their writing in congregation, that, by gaining time, they might delude the Emperours expectation. But yet, at that time, they ſaid no more. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, conſulting together, they held it expedient to informe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour well, as well of this particular, as generally of the manner how they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Councell. And to doe this, the Biſhop of <hi>Prague</hi> rode poſt, that <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Prague</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by poſt to informe the Emperor of the State of the Councell</note> hee might returne before the Seſſion. The Legats, perceiuing that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell ſtood vpon bad termes, in many reſpects, but eſpecially for the diſtaſte and ſuſpition of the Pope, thought it neceſſary to informe him fully of all that was paſt, and imminent. For this, Friar <hi>Leonardus Marinus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Lanciano,</hi> was choſen, becauſe hee was a man of ſpirit and acceptable to <note place="margin">And the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciano</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Pope.</note> the Pope, promoted and much fauoured by him, and a friend alſo to <hi>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pando,</hi> whoſe inſtruction was to enforme the Popefully, to excuſe the Legats and to pacifie his Holineſſe. Hee carried the common Letters of the Legats for his credence, to which <hi>Simoneta</hi> made much and long difficultie to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:17208:267"/>
nor would haue done it, but that they agreed that euery one ſhould write particular letters of his owne. <hi>Simoneta</hi> wrote; that hee did thinke to ſend the Archbiſhop of <hi>Roſano,</hi> for his particular, to giue a more exact infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but that, being better aduiſed, hee afterwards reſolued to expect the euent of <hi>Lanciano</hi> his iourney.</p>
            <p>The mutual diſtaſts; and detractions of the Romans againſt the Trentines, and of theſe againſt thoſe, did increaſe at the arriuall of euery Currier. In <hi>Trent,</hi> the fauourers of reſidence did bewayle the miſeries of the Church, the ſeruitude of the Councel, and the manifeſt deſperation to ſee the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in <hi>Rome.</hi> The oppoſites lamented, that a Schiſme was plotted in the Councell, yea, an Apoſtacie from the Apoſtolique Sea. They ſayd that the <hi>Vltramontans,</hi> for malice and enuie againſt the Italians, did aime not ſo much at the depreſſion, as at the abolition of the Papacie; which beeing the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Church, becauſe CHRIST hath made it ſo, the totall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the whole building muſt needes enſue. The Pope, receiuing new aduices dayly, and alwayes worſe, as euery day ſome nouity did happen in <hi>Trent,</hi> beſides the accidents occurring in <hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> contrary to his affayres, was ſtill more diſpleaſed. The opinion of the maior part for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidencie, did not ſo much trouble him, as the practiſes which were made, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the Ambaſſadours, perceiuing that the Princes were intereſted in it againſt his authority. He ſaw the Emperor was wholly bent to make his ſonne King of the Romans, and ready to giue all ſatisfaction to <hi>Germany;</hi> and therefore had cauſed theſe Articles of reformation to be preſented to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, and called to him the Amb. <hi>Prague,</hi> to find a way how to propoſe them in Councell, and eſtabliſh them. Hee knew the French King was exhauſted, compaſſed with infinite difficulties, and in danger to be forced to compound with the Hugonots, which if it happen, the French Prelates may runne to the Councell, ioyne with the Spaniards, and make themſelues authors of other propoſitions againſt the Papall authoritie. Hee thought to calme the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, which he ſaw prepared againſt him, both with deeds and words, by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uying foure thouſand <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> and three thouſand Dutch horſe-men, hee ſent to <hi>Auignion Nicolas Gamba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In <hi>Italie</hi> hee thought it not hard to induce all. For the Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> was wholly his; In <hi>Sauoy</hi> hee had intereſt, for the ſuccours he ſent him, and for the danger hee was in; the Venetians deſired to keepe the <hi>Vltramontans</hi> out of <hi>Italie;</hi> the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> had neede of him for <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> for the actuall neceſſitie in which it was. Therefore he made the propoſition in <hi>Rome</hi> to the Emperours Ambaſſador, and the Venetians, and ſent the Abbat of Saint <hi>Saluto</hi> for this end into <hi>France,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Odeſcalco</hi> into <hi>Spaine;</hi> to whom alſo hee gaue inſtruction; to complaine to the King that the Spaniſh Biſhops were vnited againſt his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to ſhew him that the propoſitions of the Emperour were fit to
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:17208:268"/>
make a Schiſme. It was eaſie to foreſee the iſſue of that proiect, to any that did know, though but ſuperficially, the ends of the Princes: The Emperor would by no meanes condeſcend to any thing that might giue ſuſpicion to the Proteſtants; the French King was ſo farre from hindering the paſſage to the Hugonots in <hi>Italy,</hi> that hee would haue beene content to haue ſeene his whole kingdome rid of them; <hi>Spaine</hi> hauing great poſſeſſions in thoſe parts, <note place="margin">But cannot effect it.</note> did more feare and abhorre an vnion of Italian Princes, then deſire the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the heretiques; the Venetians and Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> could not conſent to any thing, which might trouble the peace of <hi>Italy.</hi> And ſo it happened that the propoſition of the league was not imbraced by any of the Princes, euery one alleadging a particular cauſe, and all one common, that it would hinder the progreſſe of the Councell; which many beleeued would not haue diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Holineſſe: and the rather becauſe hee againe propoſed in Conſiſtory the declaration of the Continuation, and that himſelfe would make a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration concerning Reſidencie. Which things he did not performe, in regard of the opinion of Cardinall <hi>Carpi,</hi> followed by the greater part of the other Cardinals, that it would not bee good ſeruice for his Holineſſe, nor the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique Sea to make himſelfe authour of odious things, which might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liene the mindes of one party, and that it was better to leaue them in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Councell for that time.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding he did not forbeare to complaine in Conſiſtory of all the Ambaſſadours. Of the French hee ſayd, that <hi>Lanſac</hi> ſeemed to bee an <note place="margin">The Pope complaineth of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.</note> Ambaſſador of the Hugonots, by his propoſitions, deſiring that the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> the Proteſtants of <hi>Suiſſerland, Saxonie,</hi> and <hi>Wittemberg,</hi> ſhould bee expected at the Councell, who are declared enemies and rebels, and haue no other end then to corrupt the Councel, and make it Hugonor; which he ſayd himſelfe would preſerue, and haue forces to doe it. That hee alſo and his Colleagues defended ſome, who diſputed the authority of the Councell to be aboue the Pope, which opinion is hereticall, and the fauourers of it are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, threatning to perſecute and chaſtiſe them. Hee ſayd they liued like Hugonots; that they did no reuerence to the Sacrament; that <hi>Lanſac,</hi> at his table, in the preſence of many Prelates inuited, had ſayd, that there would come ſo many Biſhops out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germanie,</hi> that they would chaſe the Idol out of <hi>Rome.</hi> He complained of one of the Venetian Ambaſſadors, and ſent his Maſters word of him. He ſayd of the Cardinals, <hi>Mantua, Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pando,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">And of three of the Legats.</note> and <hi>Varmienſe,</hi> that they were vnworthy of the <hi>Cap.</hi> Of the Prelates he ſpake as occaſion was offered, and perſwaded the friends of each of them to write vnto them. All this was done and ſayd by him, not becauſe he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it, or for intemperance of his tongue, but by Arte, to force euery one, ſome for feare, ſome for ſhame, ſome for ciuilitie, to make his Apologie to him, which he did moſt eaſily receiue, and readily beleeue. And its incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible <note place="margin">That hee might force them to make their Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies.</note> how his affaires were aduanced by this meanes. For hee gained ſome, and cauſed the others to proceede more warily, and remiſly. Whereupon his naturall courage reuiuing in him, which ſtill was full of hope, hee ſayd, that all were vnited againſt him, but that, in the end, he would make them all be reunited in his fauour, becauſe they haue all neede of him, ſome deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding aſſiſtance, and ſome graces.</p>

Amongſt the Prelates which the Pope ſent laſt to the Councel, from <hi>Rome,</hi> as hath beene ſaid, there was one <hi>Charles <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſconte,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>

Hee charged him to obſerue the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> aboue all the Legates, but to holde intelligence with <hi>Simoneta,</hi> who knew his minde, and to labour that there ſhould bee no more any demand made for the declaration concerning reſidencie; or, if it could not bee hindered, that it ſhould be deferred vntill the end of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; and that, if that alſo could not bee obtained, hee ſhould delay it as long as it was poſſible, vſing all meanes which hee thought expedient for this ende. Hee gaue him alſo a liſt of the names of thoſe who fauoured the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man part in that matter, with commiſſion to thanke them, and incourage them to continue, and to promiſe them recompenſe: referring to his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, intreating with the oppoſites, to vſe ſome kind of threats, without ſharpeneſſe of words, but ſtrong in ſubſtance, and to promiſe to thoſe that would relent, obliuion of all that is paſt, and to giue particular aduice to Cardinall <hi>Boromeo</hi> of whatſoeuer did happen: which he did. And the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the letters written by him, with much acuteneſſe and iudgemens, hath been ſhewed me, out of which a great part of thoſe things which follow hath beene drawen.</p>
            <p>But hauing receiued aduiſe of the promiſe made by <hi>Mantua,</hi> hee ſaw it was hard to diuert the handling of that Article, and thought that the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene the Legates would produce greater euils, and eſteemed this to bee the moſt principall point, as well in deede, as for reputation. For how could he hope to repreſſe the attempts of the miniſters of other Princes, when he could not gouerne his owne? Therefore hee thought it neceſſary to vſe the ſtrongeſt medicines, for a diſeaſe that had ſeized on the vitall parts; and reſolued to ſhew openly how ill hee was ſatisfied with <hi>Mantua,</hi> which hee thought would either make him alter his courſe, or aske leaue to depart, or by ſome meanes, to retire from <hi>Trent:</hi> and if the diſſolution of the Councell did inſue, it was ſo much the better.

For howſoeuer the Pope and the Cardinall were reconciled, yet after his death, returning to <hi>Mantua,</hi> with the corps of his Maſter, he was impriſoned by the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> vpon diuers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and troubled a long time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the Pope was thus affected, <hi>Lanciano</hi> came to <hi>Rome;</hi> and amongſt <note place="margin">Whoſe Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie alſo, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millus Olluus</hi> is in diſgrace with the Pope.</note> other things, preſented to his Holineſſe a letter ſubſcribed by more then thirtie Biſhops, in fauour of reſidencie. In which they complayned of his diſtaſte againſt them, proteſting they did not thinke their opinion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">The negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Arch biſhop of <hi>Lanciano</hi> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope.</note> to his authority, which they would defend againſt all, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it inuiolable in all partes. This made a miraculous diſpoſition in the Popes minde to receiue kindely the letters of the Legates, <hi>Mantua, Seripando;</hi> and <hi>

For now it could not bee ſayd, that the Pope and all the Court were oppoſite to an opinion, which the world held to bee pious and neceſſary. And this hath ſucceeded well. For hereby they haue gained credit and authority with the Prelates, and haue beene able to moderate the raſhneſſe of ſome, who, otherwiſe, would haue made a great diuiſion, to the great dammage of the Church. Hee related the frequent and effectuall perſwaſions, which they made to quiet the Prelates, and the affronts alſo which they receiued from ſome, who told them they could not bee ſilent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their conſcience. Hee ſhewed the dangers and neceſſitie which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Mantua</hi> to make the promiſe. Hee added, that the greater part of the Prelates, to take all ſuſpition out of the minde of his Holineſſe, did offer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in the next Seſſion, that he was Head of the Church, and had giuen him commiſſion to deliuer the Ambaſſage to him, which, for many reſpects, they thought not fit to commit to writing; and named ſo many of them, that hee made the Pope marueile, and ſay; that bad tongues, and worſe pens had pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe Fathers in other colours. Then hee ſhewed him the vnion, and reſolution of the miniſters of Princes to maintaine the Councell, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Prelates to ſupport any thing, that it might continue, and no occaſion ariſe to diſſolue it; that the point of reſidence was ſo aduanced, and the Fathers ſo intereſted, in regard of their conſcience and honour, and the Ambaſſadors for their reputation, that it was impoſſible to denie the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and defining of it. He gaue him an account, and a copie of the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Emperours Ambaſſadors, ſhewing they did all aime to ſubiect the Pope to the Councell, and that the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> did dexterouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the propoſing of them in congregation. Hee concluded, that, it being impoſſible to recall that which was paſt, his Holineſſe might attribute much vnto chance, pardoning, according to his vſuall benignitie, that which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

had happened, not by malice, but by negligence of ſome, and might make better prouiſion for hereafter, becauſe all were reſolued not to propoſe or handle any thing, before it was conſulted and determined by his Holineſſe.</p>
            <p>The Pope, weighing the remonſtrance well, ſent preſently backe the Arch-biſhop, with letters to the Legats, and to ſome of thoſe who had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is ſent back to <hi>Trent</hi> with letters and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> the letters to him, in anſwere of the letters which hee brought, and gaue him commiſſion to tell them all in his name, that his will was the Councell ſhould bee free; that euery one ſhould ſpeake, according to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; that they ſhould make Decrees according to trueth; that hee was not diſpleaſed becauſe the voyces were giuen more after one manner then another, but in regard of the attempts and practiſes to perſwade and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence others, and of the contentions and bitterneſſe betweene them, which things doe not become a generall Councell. Therefore that hee doeth not oppoſe the determination of reſidence, but aduiſeth them to lay aſide their heate, and that when their minds are quieted, and doe aime only at the ſeruice of God, and benefit of the Church, they may handle it with profit. Hee was content it ſhould bee told <hi>Mantua</hi> that hee was glad to vnderſtand of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie, and affection, and that hee will giue a demonſtration thereof; praying him to labour that the Councell may bee quickly ended, becauſe, by the diſcourſe he hath had with <hi>Lanciano,</hi> hee hath vnderſtood that it may bee concluded in September. And, in conformitie hereof, hee wrote a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Legates, that, following the ſteps of the Councel vnder <hi>Iulius,</hi> and taking the points already digeſted by it, they ſhould immediatly determine them, and make an end.</p>
            <p>At that time they were buſied in <hi>Trent,</hi> in hearing the Diuines ſpeake in the Congregations, concerning the ſixteene Articles, who began the ninth, and ended the three and twentieth of the moneth; and howſoeuer they were in number 60. yet nothing worthy obſeruation was deliuered by any, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the matter beeing new, neuer handled by the Schoolemen; defined in the Councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> at the firſt onſet; and maintained by the Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by force of armes, rather then by reaſon and diſputation, they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſtudie but what was written in the laſt fourtie yeeres, by ſome few, excited by the diſputations of <hi>Luther.</hi> Therefore they all agreed, that there <note place="margin">The commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Cup is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed.</note> was no neceſſitie or precept of the Cup; and, for proofe, they alleadged pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the new Teſtament, where bread onely is named; as in Saint <hi>Iohn, Hee that eateth this bread ſhall liue for euer.</hi> They ſayd that, vntill the time of the Apoſtles, bread onely was in vſe; as it is read in Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in <hi>Emmaus</hi> knew CHRIST in breaking of bread, where there is no mention of wine. And Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ready to ſuffer ſhip wracke at the Sea, doth bleſſe the bread, and ſpeaketh not of wine. In many of the olde Canons mention is made of the communion of the Laitie, as differing from that of the Clergie, which difference could not conſiſt in any thing but in the Cup. To theſe were added the figures of the old Teſtament. Manna, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> hath no drinke in it. <hi>Ionathan,</hi> who taſted the honie, did not drinke; and ſuch other congruities. And it was a matter of great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to heare them all repeate the ſame things. I ought not to omit one
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:17208:270"/>
particular, ſeriouſly deliuered by <hi>Iames Payua,</hi> a Portugall, that CHRIST, both by precept and example, hath declared that the bread is due to all, and the Cup to the Prieſts onely. For hauing conſecrated the bread, he gaue it to his diſciples, who then were Laiques, &amp; repreſented the whole people, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they ſhould all eate of it; afterwards hee ordained them Prieſts, in theſe words, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of mee;</hi> and, in the end, hee conſecrated the <note place="margin">The opinion of <hi>Iames Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua a</hi> Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall.</note> Cup, and gaue it to them now conſecrated Prieſts. But the wiſer ſort did lightly paſſe ouer this kinde of arguments, and confined themſelues to two. One, that the Church hath power from CHRIST to change the things <note place="margin">Two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts againſt the communion of the Cup.</note> that are accidentall in the Sacraments, and that to the <hi>Eucharist</hi> both kindes are neceſſary, as it is a ſacrifice, but as it is a Sacrament, one onely, ſo that the Church hath power to ordaine the vſe of one alone. Which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, becauſe it did once, in the beginning, change in Baptiſme the inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Trinitie into the inuocation of CHRIST onely, and returned afterwards to the diuine inſtitution. The other reaſon was, that the Church cannot erre; but ſhee hath ſuffered the vſe of bread onely to be brought in; and finally hath approued it, in the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and therefore it muſt bee ſayd that there is no diuine precept or neceſſitie to the contrary. But Friar <hi>Antonius Mandolphus,</hi> a Diuine, belonging to the Biſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> hauing firſt affirmed that hee was of the opinion of others in this, that there was no diuine precept, obſerued, that it was as contrary to the Catholique doctrine to giue the Cup to the <hi>Laiques</hi> by diuine precept, as it was to denie it to them by diuine precept. Therefore all thoſe reaſons, which did ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, were to be layd aſide, and thoſe of the diſciples in <hi>Emmaus,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſhip, becauſe by them it would bee concluded that it was not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge to conſecrate one kinde without the other, which is contrary to all the Doctors, and meaning of the Church, and ouerthroweth the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> as it is a Sacrifice, and as it is a Sacrament. That it was plaine alſo, that the diſtinction of the Laicall and Clericall Communion in the <hi>Romane Ordinary</hi> was a diuerſitie of places in the Church, not of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament receiued, becauſe otherwiſe this reaſon would conclude, that, not onely thoſe who ſay <hi>Maſſe,</hi> but all the Clergie ſhould haue the Cup. Of the authority of the Church in changing the accidentall things of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, no man can doubt; but hee ſayd it was not a time to diſpute whether the Cup were accidentall, or ſubſtantiall. Hee concluded that this Article might bee omitted, as already decided in the Councel of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and that the fourth and fifth Articles might bee exactly handled, becauſe, granting the Cup to all Nations that deſire it, all other diſputations are ſuperfluous, yea hurtfull. <hi>Iohn Paul,</hi> a Diuine of the Biſhop of fiue Churches, ſpake alſo to the ſame purpoſe, and both of them did diſpleaſe, becauſe it was thought they ſpake againſt their conſcience, at the inſtance of their maſters.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſecond Article, the Diuines were alſo vniforme in the affirmatiue, and all their reaſons were reduced to three Heads. The congrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the old Teſtament, when the people did participate of the meate offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in the ſacrifices, but neuer of the drinke offerings. To take away from the vulgar, occaſion to beleeue that one thing is contained vnder the bread, another vnder the wine. The third the danger of irreuerence. And heere the
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:17208:270"/>
reaſons recited by <hi>Gerſon</hi> were brought; that the blood might be ſhed, either in the Church, or in bringing of it, eſpecially ouer the Mountaines in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that it would hang in the beards of the Laikes, that it would bee ſower if it were kept, that there would want veſſels to hold enough for ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand or twenty thouſand perſons; that, in ſome places, it would bee too great a charge, in reſpect of the price of wine; that the veſſels would not bee kept cleane; that a Laie man would bee of equall dignitie with a Prieſt. Which reaſons it was neceſſary to ſay that they were iuſt and good; otherwiſe the Prelates and Doctors, for ſo many ages, would haue taught an vntrueth, and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> erred. All theſe reaſons (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the laſt) were thought ridiculous, becauſe thoſe dangers might bee more eaſily withſtood in theſe times, then they could in thoſe 12. firſt ages, when the Church was in greater pouerty. And the laſt ſeemed to bee of no force to ſhew that the change was reaſonably made, but was good to maintaine it after it was made. The two Diuines afore named did aduiſe that this Article alſo might bee omitted.</p>
            <p>In the third Article, that all CHRIST is receiued vnder one kinde, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>concomitancie,</hi> deliuered by the Diuines, was taken for an argument. For the body of CHRIST being vnder the bread, by vertue of the <hi>conſecration,</hi> CHRIST hauing ſayd, by words omnipotent and effectiue, <hi>This is my body,</hi> and the body being aliue, it muſt needes haue blood, ſoule, and diuinitie: ſo that all CHRIST was vndoubtedly receiued vnder the bread. But ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred hereby, that therefore all graces are receiued in it, ſeeing that he who hath all CHRIST wanteth nothing, becauſe hee is abundantly ſufficient. Others ſayd to the contrary, that the illation was neither neceſſary, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. For thoſe who are baptized, are filled with CHRIST, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, and yet other Sacraments are giuen vnto them. And becauſe ſome auoyded the force of the reaſon by ſaying, that the other Sacraments are neceſſary in reſpect of ſinnes committed after baptiſme,, it was replyed that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church did immediately communicate the baptized, ſo that, as from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with all CHRIST in baptiſme, it cannot bee inferred that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt doth not conferre other <hi>graces,</hi> ſo from hauing receiued all CHRIST vnder the bread, it cannot be inferred that no other grace is to be conferred by the blood; neither can it be ſayd, without great abſurdity, that the Prieſt in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> hauing receiued the body of our LORD, and, by conſequence, all CHRIST, doeth not receiue any <hi>grace</hi> in drinking of the Cup: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to drinke of it, would be a worke indifferent and vaine. Moreouer it is decided, by the common doctrine of the Schooles, and of the Church, that by euery ſacramentall action, by vertue of the worke it ſelfe, which they call, <hi>Ex opere operato,</hi> a degree of <hi>grace</hi> is conferred. But it cannot be denied that to drinke the blood of CHRIST is a ſacramentall action, therefore it can not bee denied, that it hath a ſpeciall <hi>grace</hi> annexed. In this controuerſie the greater part of the Diuines held, that, not ſpeaking of the quantity of <hi>grace,</hi> anſwerable to the diſpoſition of the receiuer, but of that which the Schoole-men call ſacramentall, it was equall in him that receiued one kinde onely, and in him that receiued both. The other opinion was defended, though with the ſmaller number, yet more earneſtly. Friar <hi>Amante Seruita,</hi> a <hi>Breſcian,</hi> a
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:17208:271"/>
Diuine of the Biſhop of <hi>Sebenico,</hi> a fauourer of this ſecond opinion, paſſed very farre, I know not with what aime or end; who, alledging the doctrine of <hi>Thomas Caietane,</hi> that blood is not part of humane nature, but the firſt aliment, and adding that it could not bee ſayd, that the body doth neceſſarily draw in <hi>concomitance</hi> its aliment, did inferre that the thing contained vnder both kindes is not abſolutely the ſame: and hee added, that the blood of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> according to the words of CHRIST, was blood ſpilt, and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, <note place="margin">Friar <hi>Amante</hi> concurreth in opinion with the Lutherans</note> out of the vaines, in which if it remained, it could not bee drinke, ſo that it could not bee drawen in <hi>concomitancie</hi> with the vaine, and that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was inſtituted in memory of the death of CHRIST, which was by ſeparation, and effuſion of blood. Whereat there was a noyſe rayſed amongſt the Diuines, and a cracking of the benches. Therefore, recalling himſelfe, <note place="margin">But preſently recanteth, and asketh pardon</note> hee retracted, and ſaid that the heat of diſpuaion had caryed him to alledge the reaſons of the aduerſaries, as if they had beene his owne, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hee purpoſed to reſolue in the end; and hee ſpent the reſidue of his diſcourſe in reſoluing them; and, in concluſion, asked pardon of the ſcandall giuen, becauſe hee had not ſpoken with ſuch caution, as to ſhew plainely that thoſe reaſons were captious, and contrary to his owne opinion. And he made an end without ſpeaking of the other 3. Articles.</p>
            <p>But, concerning the fourth Article, the Spaniſh Diuines, and dependants <note place="margin">The 4. Article that the Cup is not to bee allowed to the people, is ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Spaniſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates.</note> on <hi>Spaine,</hi> were maruellouſly vnited, in giuing counſell that, by no meanes, the vſe of the Cup ſhould bee permitted to <hi>Germany,</hi> or others. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that which they ſaid was; That none of the cauſes which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mooued the Church to take it from the people beeing ceaſed, yea beeing now more vrgent, and others more ſtrong and eſſentiall annexed, it was fit to perſeuere in the determination of the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and of the Church before and after. And diſcourſing of the dangers of irreuerence, which was the firſt kinde of the cauſes, they ſaid they were now more to bee feared, then in former times. For then there was none who did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly beleeue the reall and naturall preſence of CHRIST in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after the conſecration, ſo long as the kindes did laſt, and yet the Cup was taken away, becauſe men had not ſuch regard to the blood of CHRIST, as was neceſſary; and therefore what reuerence can bee hoped for now, when ſome doe denie the reall preſence, and ſome will haue it onely in the vſe? Beſides there is not ſo much deuotion amongſt good Catholiques, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in humane affaires, and negligence in diuine beeing much increaſed; ſo that it may bee feared, that a greater neglect may produce a greater irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence. To make a difference betweene Prieſts and others, is now more neceſſary then euer, becauſe the Proteſtants haue expoſed them to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the people, and ſpread a doctrine which taketh from them their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions, ſubiecteth them to lay Magiſtrates, detracteth from their power of abſoluing from ſinnes, and ſaith alſo that they ſhould bee called to the miniſtery by the people, and bee obnoxious to bee depoſed by them; which ſhould force the Church to preſerue exactly all thoſe rites, which may giue them reputation. The danger that the vulgar may receiue an impreſſion of falſe beleefe, and bee perſwaded that ſome thing is in the Cup which is not vnder the bread, is now more vrgent, in regard of the new opinions ſpread
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:17208:271"/>
abroad. Many ſaid, that the Church did prohibite the Chalice, to oppoſe the errour of <hi>Nestorius,</hi> who did beleeue that all CHRIST was not vnder one kinde; which being the opinion of ſome of the heretiques now, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition is to bee maintained ſtill. What they would inferre by this I cannot expreſſe better, hauing neuer read that <hi>Neſtorius</hi> did ſpeake in this ſubiect, nor that the Modernes doe handle it with thoſe termes. But the third dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that the authoritie of the Church would bee debaſed, and a concluſion made that it hath erred in taking a way the Cup, may bee called not a danger, but a thing that would certainely happen; neither was the requeſt made by the Proteſtants, but to conclude, that the Synod hauing confeſſed the errour paſt, hath corrected it, by this graunt; ſo they will publiſh the victory, and demaund a change alſo in other conſtitutions of the Church. They ſaid they were deceiued, who thought the Dutch-men would bee ſatisfied with this, and ſubmit themſelues to the decrees of the Councell; yea, they will take away faſts, difference of meates, demaund marriage of Prieſts, and an abolition of Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction in the exterior Court, which is the marke at which they all doe ayme; that it is not credible they are Catholikes who deſire the Cup, becauſe the Catholikes doe all beleeue that the Church cannot erre, and that no deuotion is acceptable to God if it be not approued by it, and that obedience to the Church is the height of Chriſtian perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that it is certainly to bee beleeued, that hee that doth demaund the Cup thinkes it neceſſarie, and hee that thinketh ſo, cannot bee a Catholique; that none doth demaund it beleeuing that hee may not lawfully vſe it without the graunt of the Councell, but that they may not bee hindred by their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who, if they were alone; would vſurpe it, without any allowance; that of this euery one may bee aſſured, obſeruing, that, not the people, but the Princes doe entreat, who will not ſuffer a nouitie without a lawfull Decree, not becauſe the people would not bring it in of themſelues, more willingly, then ſeeke it of the Councell.</p>
            <p>And this argument was ſo preſſed, that Fryar <hi>Francis Forier,</hi> a <hi>Portugall,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A petulant ſaying of a Fryar againſt the Princes, who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Cup.</note> vſed a conceipt, which the auditors thought to bee not onely bold, but petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant alſo; that the Princes would make themſelues Lutherans, by permiſſion of the Councell. The Spaniards exhorted them to conſider, that, if this were graunted to <hi>Germanie, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> would demaund the like, to whom it could not bee denied; from whence alſo theſe Nations would learne not to obey, and to deſire a change of other Eccleſiaſticall Lawes; and that to make a moſt Catholike countrey Lutheran, there was no better meane, then to giue it the Cup. <hi>Franciſcus Della Torre,</hi> a <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> repeated a ſaying of the Cardinall Saint <hi>Angelo,</hi> the chiefe <hi>Penitentiarie,</hi> that Sathan, who was woont to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe into an <hi>Amgell</hi> of heauen, and his Miniſters into Miniſters of light, doth now vnder the couer of the Chalice, with the blood of CHRIST, exhort to giue the people a cup of poyſon.</p>
            <p>Some added, that the prouidence of God, guiding the Church, inſpired the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> in the former age, to eſtabliſh the taking away of the Cup, by a decree, not onely for the reaſons which were then of force, but becauſe if it were now in vſe, there would bee no externall ſigne, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the <hi>Catholiques</hi> from the <hi>Heretiques,</hi> and this diſtinction being taken
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:17208:272"/>
away, the <hi>Protestants</hi> would bee mingled in the Church with the faithfull, and that would follow which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>A little leauen doth quickly make ſower a great lumpe;</hi> ſo that to graunt the Cuppe would bee nothing elſe but to giue the heretiques greater opportunitie to hurt the Church. Some alſo, who knew not the petition had beene preſented to the Pope, and by him, (to vnburthen himſelfe, and draw the matter in length) referred to the Councell, did expound it ill, that the requeſt was then made to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and not to the Pope, ſuſpecting it was to this end, that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large euery grant with vnſit interpretations, and ſo cauſe a neceſſitie of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Councell.</p>
            <p>But thoſe who thought they might condeſcend to the requeſts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and of ſo many other Princes and people, gaue counſell to proceed with leſſe rigour, and not to make ſuch bad interpretations of the godly prayers of the weake brethren, but to follow the precept of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to transforme themſelues into the defects of the imperfect, to winne them, and not to haue worldly aymes of reputation, but to gouerne themſelues by the rules of charitie which treading vnder foot all others, euen thoſe of humane prudence, and wiſedome, hath compaſſion, and yeeldeth to euery one. They ſaid they ſaw no conſiderable reaſon adduced by the others, but onely that the <hi>Lutherans</hi> would ſay that they had prooued that the Church hath erred, and would make other demands. But hee is deceiued who beleeueth that a Negatiue will make them hold their peace. They haue ſayd already that an error hath beene committed, they will ſay hereafter, that obſtinacie is added to it; and where humane ordinations onely are in queſtion, and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not ſeeme ſtrange, nor miſbeſeeme the Church. Who knoweth not that the ſame thing cannot agree to all times, that there are innumerable Eccleſiaſticall rites eſtabliſhed and aboliſhed; and that it is not againſt the honor of the Councell to haue beleeued that a rite hath beenegood, which experience hath ſhewed to be vnprofitable. To perſwade ones ſelfe that this demand will beget others, argueth too much ſuſpicion, and deſire of aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; but S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that ſimplicitie and christian charitie doth not thinke euill, beleeueth euery thing; ſupporteth all, hopeth well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It belonged to theſe onely to ſpeake of the firſt Article, becauſe thoſe of the abſolute negatiue had nothing to ſay of it. But theſe were diuided into two opinions. One which was the more common, that it ſhould be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vpon ſuch conditions as <hi>Paul</hi> the third did grant it, of which wee haue ſpoken in their place. The other of ſome few, that if they would graunt the Cup, to make them ſtand faſt in the Church, who now doe ſtumble, it is meet ſo to temper it, as that it may produce the effect deſired; which thoſe conditions cannot doe, yea would vndoubtedly make them fall headlong into <hi>Lutheraniſme.</hi> It is certaine, that the penitent man ought rather to chooſe any temporall euill then to ſinne; yet <hi>Caietan</hi> gaue counſell, not to come to any ſpecificall compariſon, and ſay, that it is better to bee put to death with pincers, or vpon the wheele, &amp;c. becauſe by this meanes one ſhould tempt himſelfe without neceſſitie, and fall from a good diſpoſition, preſenting horrours to himſelfe to no purpoſe. So, in the preſent occaſion, theſe am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous men, when the Councels fauor ſhall bee brought vnto them, will
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:17208:272"/>
reſt ſatified, and thanke GOD, and the Church, and will thinke no more of it, ſtrengthening themſelues by little and little. It is the preciſe commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to receiue the weake in faith, not with diſputations, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing them opinions &amp; rules, but ſimply, expecting opportunitie to giue a more ample inſtruction. Hee that ſhould now propoſe a condition in <hi>Germanie,</hi> to beleeue this, or that, would trouble them much, while their mindes doe wauer, ſo that, thinking whether they ought to beleeue it or not, they will fall into ſome errour, on which they world not otherwiſe haue thought. To this reaſon they added, that howſoeuer it is maintained, that the Church hath, for iuſt cauſes, taken away the Cup, if afterwards it doeth grant it vpon other conditions, without prouiding againſt thoſe inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, for which it was firſt remooued, it is confeſſed, that it was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without cauſe. Therefore they concluded, that it was fit to conſtitute for conditions, all the remedies to the inconueniences, which firſt cauſed the prohibition, that is, that the Cup ſhould neuer be carried out of the Church, and that the bread onely ſhould be ſufficient for the ſicke, that it ſhould not bee kept, to take away the danger of ſowerneſſe, that they ſhould vſelittle pipes, to auoid effuſion, as formerly was done in the <hi>Romane</hi> Church. This being done, it will appeare that the prouiſion was firſt made vpon good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, reuerence will be ſtirred vp, people and Princes will be ſatisfied, and the weake will be tempted no more. A Spaniard ſaid, that it was not ſo eaſily to be beleeued, that the Catholiques did, with ſuch heat of deuotion, deſire the Cup, and therefore that it were good to ſend into <hi>Germanie,</hi> to be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med who they be that demand it, what their faith is, and what be their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, that the Synod, receiuing the relation, may haue a foundation to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on, and not ground an ſelfe vpon the words of other.</p>
            <p>In the ſixt Article they al expreſſed themſelues in few words, becauſe there was not much to be ſaid. For the Euchariſt not being a Sacrament neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> commanding that he who is to receiue it, ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelfe whether he bee worthy, it doeth plainely appeare, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be adminiſtred to any that hath not the vſe of reaſon; and if the contrary hath beene practiſed in ancient times, it hath beene where and when the trueth was not ſo well declared as now it is. Therefore the Synod ought to determine that the preſent vſe ſhould bee maintained. Some well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that they ought to ſpeake of Antiquitie with more reuerence, and not ſay that they wanted the knowledge of the Trueth. <hi>Deſiderius</hi> a <hi>Carmelite</hi> Friar of <hi>Palermo,</hi> had an opinion by himſelfe, that the Article ought to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; ſaying, that the difficultie being not mooued by the Proteſtants of theſe times, it was not good, by handling of it, to ſet a nouitie on foot, that the matter was probable on both ſides, and that when it ſhould be knowen that it was handled in the Councel, it would excite the curioſitie of many to thinke on it, &amp; giue them occaſion to ſtumble. For ſome might be perſuaded to beleeue that the Euchariſt is a Sacrament of neceſſitie, as well as Baptiſme, becauſe the ground of that are the words of CHRIST, <hi>He that ſhall not be borne againe of water and the Spirit, ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of heauen</hi> and of this, <hi>If ye eate not my fleſh and drinke my blood, yee ſhall not haue life.</hi> And the exception of children cannot plainely be grounded vpon the precept of S.

This cauſed the congregation to be diſmiſſed; and the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> exhorted the Archbiſhops to read and conſider of the draughts made, that the order of proceeding might bee reſolued on in the next Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
            <p>This place requireth, that, becauſe the Congregations were often ended by reaſon of ſome diſtaſts giuen to ſome great Prelate, the ordinary cauſe thereof ſhould be related. It hath been ſhewed before that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Biſhops in the Councel, Penſioners of the Pope, who did all depend on <hi>Simoneta,</hi> becauſe he was moſt intereſted for his Holineſſe, and had the moſt ſecret inſtructions. Hee beeing a man of an acute iudgement, made vſe of them, according to the capacitie of euery one. Amongſt theſe, he had ſome that were bold and wittie, whom he employed in the Congregations, to croſſe thoſe who entred into matters contrary to his endes. Theſe were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the Art of ieſting ſoberly, to prouoke others, and make them ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, themſelues retaining their grauitie, and not being moued at all. The ſeruice they did to the Pope, and the Cardinal, doth deſerue particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe were the forenamed Biſhops, <hi>Caua,</hi> and <hi>Capo di Iſtria, Pompeius Zambeccarus</hi> of <hi>Bolonia,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sulmona,</hi> and <hi>Bartholomeus Sirigus,</hi> of <hi>Candia,</hi>

               <pb n="527" facs="tcp:17208:273"/>
Theſe did exaſperate alſo the diſtaſts betweene <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Simoneta;</hi> before mentinoed, by ſpeaking ill, and detracting from <hi>Mantua,</hi> aſwell in <hi>Trent</hi> by words, as by letters to <hi>Rome;</hi> which was attributed to <hi>Simoneta,</hi> becauſe eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſaw hee made much eſteeme of them. Whereof purging himſelfe to the Secretarie of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and to the Biſhop of <hi>Nola,</hi> he ſaid, that for the ſmall reſpect they bare to ſuch a Cardinal, he would not haue had any more friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them, but that he had need of them in the Congregation, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the impertinences of the Prelates.</p>

The Ambaſſadour made a very free and long oration; in which hee ſhewed the ſtate of religion in <hi>Bauaria,</hi> ſaying it was compaſſed with heretiques, who were alſo entred into it; that there were whole Pariſhes of <hi>Lutherans, Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glians,</hi>

               <hi>Flacians, Anabaptists,</hi> and of other Sects which cockle the Prelats haue not been able to weede out, becauſe the contagion is not onely in the vulgar, but in the Nobilitie alſo. The cauſe hereof hath beene the bad life of the Clergie, whoſe great wickedneſſe hee could not relate, without offending the chaſte eares of the auditorie. But it ſufficeth that his Prince doth tell them, that the amendment of Doctrine would bee in vaine and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if firſt an amendment were not made of manners. Hee added, that the Clergie is infamous for luſt; that the politique Magiſtrate doth not ſuffer a Concubinary Citizen: which fault is ſo common in the Clergie, that there are not aboue three or foure in an hundred, who are not concubinaries, or ſecretly married, or openly; that the Catholikes alſo in <hi>Germany,</hi> doe preferre a chaſte mariage before an vnchaſte ſingle life, that many haue aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doned the Church for the prohibition of the Cup, ſaying, that the word of God &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Primitiue Church doth force them to vſe it; which vntil this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is obſerued in the Oriental Churches, and formerly hath beene vſed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> 3. did grant it to <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Bauari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> doe complaine of their Prince, that he doeth enuie it to his ſubiects, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting that if the Synod doe not make prouiſion, his Highneſſe will not be able to gouerne his people, and will be forced to giue them that which hee cannot withhold. For a remedie of the ſcandals of the Clergie, hee propoſed a good reformation, and that in euery Biſhopricke Schooles and Academies ſhould be erected, to bring vp good Miniſters; he demanded the mariage of Prieſts, without which it was impoſſible, in that age to reforme the Clergie; alledging that ſingle life was not commanded by GOD. Hee demanded alſo
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:17208:274"/>
the Communion vnder both kindes, ſaying, that if it had beene permitted, many prouinces of <hi>Germanie</hi> had remained in the obedience of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Sea, whereas thoſe who haue continued in it vntill now, doe runne away from it, like a torrent, together with other nations; that the Duke doth not deſire the three remedies mentioned, hoping to reduce to the Church the ſectaries, and thoſe that are ſtrayed, but onely to retaine thoſe who are not diuided as yet. Hee ſaid it was neceſſary to begin with reformation, or elſe all the paines taken in the Councell would be in vaine; that, the Clergie being reformed, his Prince, if his opinion be asked in point of doctrine, will bee able to ſay ſomething worthy of conſideration; which is not fit to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken now, becauſe it is not conuenient to treat of making warre againſt the enemie, before one hath muſtered his owne forces at home. In the courſe of his Oration hee often interpoſed, that his Prince ſpake this, not to giue a Law to the Councell, but to intimate it with reuerence, and with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt alſo he made an end. The Synod anſwered, by the <hi>Speaker,</hi> that hauing <note place="margin">The anſwere to it.</note> long expected ſome Prince or ambaſſage of <hi>Germanie,</hi> but aboue all the Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> a <hi>Baracadoe</hi> of the Apoſtolike Sea in that Countrey, they were glad to ſee his Ambaſſadour, whom they doe receiue, and will labour as they haue done, to conſtitute whatſoeuer ſhall bee for the ſeruice of God, and ſoules health of the faithfull. The French-men, hearing this oration, were well pleaſed, becauſe they were not the only men that did freely admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Prelats of that which was fit to be told them; but hearing the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, they grew iealous, becauſe this was courteous, and theirs ſharpe. The difference was, becauſe, howſoeuer the <hi>Bauarian</hi> did acutely bite the Clergie in generall, yet he ſpake of the Fathers with much reuerence, whereas the French oration was eſpecially directed to reprehend thoſe that heard them; beſides the anſwere made to them was premeditated, and that to the <hi>Bauarian extempore.</hi> But they were both vſed alike, being heard with the eares onely.</p>
            <p>The Emperours Ambaſſadours, conſidering, that, in the laſt Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a writing in Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the grant of the Cup.</note> of the Diuines, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Italians</hi> had ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the graunt of the Cup, and that many of them had called them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques who doe demaund it, to anſwere to this and other obiections, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the propoſition of the <hi>Bauarian,</hi> and to preuent the Prelats that they fall not into the impertinencies vſed by the Diuines, compoſed a wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which they preſented in the ſame congregation, after the Ambaſſador had ended his Oration. The ſubſtance whereof was. That, in regard of the place they hold, they haue thought fit to admoniſh the Fathers of ſome things before they deliuer their ſuffrages. That the Diuines haue theſe laſt dayes ſpoken well, as farre as concerneth their owne Countries, but not for other Prouinces and Kingdomes. They prayed the Fathers ſo to frame their opinions, that they might giue a medicine not to the ſound parts, which haue no neede of it, but to the members ill affected; which they will fitly doe, when they ſhall know which bee the weake parts, and what helpe they deſire. And beginning with the Kingdome of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> they ſaid there was no neede to goe farre, nor to mention the things handled in <hi>Conſtance,</hi> but onely to adde, that, after that Councell, no practiſe, force, or warre, hath
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:17208:274"/>
beene able to take the Cup out of that Kingdome. That the Church did louingly grant it vnto them, vpon certaine conditions, which <hi>Pius,</hi> did reuoke, becauſe they were not obſerued. But <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, to regaine that kingdom, ſent <hi>Nuncij,</hi> to permit it vnto them, though the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by reaſon of ſome impediments, was not brought to perfection. Now the Emperor, hauing at his charge, inſtituted the Arch-biſhopricke of <hi>Prague</hi> and obtained in the Parliament of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> that the <hi>Caliſtine</hi> Prieſts ſhould not bee ordained but by the Arch-biſhop, and ſhould acknowledge him for a lawfull Prelate, did beſeech the Pope that ſuch an occaſion, to regaine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, might not be loſt, which his Holineſſe hauing referred to the iudgement of the Councell, it will remaine in the power thereof to, preſerue that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by granting the Cup vnto them. That thoſe people differ but little from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> that they neuer would admit of maried Prieſts, nor ordained by any Biſhop out of the communion of the Apoſtolique Sea; that, in their prayers they make mention of the Pope, Cardinals, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; that, if they haue any ſmall difference in doctrine, it may eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, ſo that the Cup bee granted to them, that it is no maruaile if an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant multitude haue conceiued that opinion; ſeeing that men learned, godly; and Catholike doe defend that more grace is conferred in the Communion of both kindes, then of one onely. They exhorted the Fathers to take heede, that their too great ſeueritie doe not make them deſperate, and caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into the armes of the Proteſtants. They added, that there were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes in <hi>Hungarie, Austria, Morauia, Sileſia, Carintbia, Carniola, Stiria, Bauaria, Sueuia,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Germanie,</hi> who deſire the Cup with great zeale; which being made knowen to <hi>Paul</hi> the third, hee gaue the Biſhops leaue to communicate them with it, which, for many impediments, was not effected. Of thoſe there is danger that, if the Cup be taken from them, they will turne to the Lutherans. The Diuines haue, in their publike diſputations, made a doubt; that thoſe who deſire the Cup are heretikes; but his Maieſtie doeth demand it for Catholikes onely. That there is hope to reduce, by this grant, many Proteſtants alſo, as ſome of them haue already proteſted they would returne and bee conuerted, being ſatiated with nouities; otherwiſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is to bee feared. And to anſwere to him that asked a few dayes ſinee, who hee is that doeth demaund it, hee may know that the Emperour doeth deſire, that the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Prague</hi> may ordaine <hi>Calistine</hi> Prieſts, and the Ambaſſadours for the Clergie of <hi>Bohemia</hi> deſire the ſame, for that kingdome; and if there were no hope to obtaine it, there would not be left ſo much as any little remainder of Catholikes. In <hi>Hungarie</hi> they force the Prieſts to giue them the Cup, by taking away their goods, and threatning to kill them; and the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Strigonium</hi> hauing puniſhed ſome Prieſts for doing it, the people remayneth without Catholike Curates, hath no Baptiſme, and is abſolutely ignorant of Chriſtian doctrine, ready to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Paga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſme. In concluſion, they prayed the Fathers to haue compaſſion, and to finde a meanes to preſerue thoſe people in the faith, and call backe thoſe that are ſtrayed.</p>
            <p>In the end of the congregation the Legates gaue the draughts compoſed, concerning the three firſt Articles, for feare of the oppoſition made in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

congregation. The dayes following the Fathers handled them, and on the 3 they diſeourſed very amply, ſpeaking of the ſacramental grace, whether more bee receiued in both kindes then in one: and ſome defended one part and ſome another. Cardinall <hi>Seripando</hi> ſaid, that the ſame difficultie hauing beene diſcuſſed in the Councell vnder <hi>Iulius,</hi> it was reſolued that it ſhould not bee diſcuſſed againe. Yet ſome Prelates deſired a declaration of it; but were not hearkened vnto, in regard of the contrarietie of opinions, and becauſe the greater part did hold that both opinions were probable. But to auoyde all difficultie, it was concluded, that all CHRIST the fountaine of all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is receiued. Some of the Biſhops prepared for their departure from <hi>Trent,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Some of the Prelates are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to depart from <hi>Trent,</hi> fearing they had ſpoken too freely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> who, hauing ſpoken with much paſſion and heate concerning reſidence, ſaw they were hated, and feared ſome grieuous incounter, in caſe they ſhould perſeuere. Amongſt theſe was the Biſhop of <hi>Modena</hi> before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, a man very learned, and of a ſincere conſcience, <hi>Iulius Paueſi</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Surrento,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Viuiers, Peter Paul Coſtazzarus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aqui,</hi> and others, who had obtained leaue from the Legates: which <hi>Mantua</hi> gaue them, that (in regard they were his friends) he might ſet them at libertie, and the others, to take away occaſion of diſtaſtes. But the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of <hi>Portugall</hi> did remonſtrate to the Legates that this would bee a diſreputation to the Councell, the cauſe being knowen why they ſuffered and that it would bee ſayd there was no libertie, which would alſo be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to the Pope. Thereupon they reſolued to ſtop them, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">But are ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</note> becauſe they vnderſtood, that ſo ſoone as they were departed, others would aske leaue alſo.</p>
            <p>The Legates deferring to propoſe the other Articles, in regard of the difficulties, which they foreſaw, the third of Iuly the Emperours Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours and the Bauarian deſired that they would deliuer their opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; and a Congregation beeing called the next day to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the French Ambaſſadours preſented a writing, exhorting the Fathers <note place="margin">The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Bauaria</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a writing to perſwade the grant of the Cup.</note> to graunt the Communion of the Cup, making this their ground, that in matters of Poſitiue Law, as this was, they ought to yeelde, and not to bee ſo obſtinate, but to conſider the neceſſitie of the time, and not giue ſcandall to the world, by ſhewing themſelues ſo conſtant in obſeruing mens preceptes, and neglecting GODS; by reiecting reformations. And in the ende they required, that what determination ſoeuer they would make, it might not preiudice the vſe of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> who receiue the Cup in their Conſecration, nor the cuſtome of ſome Monaſteries of the Kingdome which doe, at certaine times, adminiſter it. Yet nothing elſe was done in that Congregation, but onely ſixteene poynts of doctrine giuen foorth, to bee diſcuſſed in the Congregations following.</p>
            <p>The Legates were aſtoniſhed at the propoſition of the Frenchmen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding they were ioyned with the Imperialiſts, for which cauſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues <note place="margin">The Legates are troubled with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of the French-men and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts, in this point of the Chalice.</note> were to walke more warily. And weighing well the motiues of the Frenchmen to derogate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poſitiue precepts, they obſerued that the grant of the Cup, beſides the difficulties propoſed, did draw with it many more, in diuers matters. They remembred the requeſt for marriage of Prieſts, made
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:17208:275"/>
by the <hi>Bauarian,</hi> and that <hi>Lanſac,</hi> in a feaſt two dayes before, in the preſence of many Prelates inuited, exherting them to gratifie the Emperour in the petition for the Cup, ſayd, that <hi>France</hi> did deſire <hi>Prayers,</hi> diuine <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Maſſes</hi> in the vulgar tongue, that the images of the Saints ſhould bee taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, &amp; mariage granted to Prieſts; and knowing that the beginning is more eaſily reſiſted then the Progreſſe, and that one may, with leſſe paines, be hindered from entring into an houſe, then driuen forth, they reſolued that it was not a fit time to treate of the Cup. They perſwaded <hi>Pagnauo,</hi> Agent of the Marquis of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> to deſire that the determination might not bee made before his King was aduiſed thereof. The Congregations of the ſixe and ſeuen dayes were intermitted, to treate with the Imperialiſts, that they would bee contended to deferre the matter, alleadging diuers reaſons: the moſt concluding whereof was, becauſe the time was too ſhort, to make the <note place="margin">And the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Finally, after long par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, they were content, that all that part which concerneth doctrine ſhould be deferred, wher with the Legats not being ſatisfied, at the laſt the Ambaſſadors conſented, that that point onely ſhould be deferred, ſo that the dilation were mentioned in the Decree, and a promiſe made to determine it another time. The French-men remained to be treated with; where they found more faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, then they expected; who ſaid, they had neither propoſed nor required it, but onely aſſiſted the Emperours Ambaſſadours. This difficulty being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, they began to compoſe the Decrees; which to diſpatch quickly, they let the Fathers knowe, that if any of them would aduiſe any thing, they ſhould commit it to writing, that the compoſition might not bee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlowed.</p>
            <p>In the Congregation of the eighth day, <hi>Daniel Barbaro,</hi> Patriarke of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia,</hi> ſaid, in deliuering his ſuffrage, that newes beeing come of the accord in <hi>France,</hi> and therefore it beeing probable that many Prelates would come, it were fit to deferre the points of doctrine vntill their arriuall: but the inſtance beeing ſeconded by none, not ſo much as by the French Ambaſſadors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, it did fall of it ſelfe. In the next Congregation <hi>Antonius Auguſtinus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lerida,</hi> put them in minde, that it would bee good to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cuſtomes of <hi>France,</hi> according to the inſtance of the Ambaſſadors, by putting in words which might preſerue the priuiledges of that kingdome, adding that, after the determination of the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were not forbid to communicate with the Cup, becauſe they had a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, which hee had ſeene, but beeing ſeconded by none but <hi>Bernar do dal Bene,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nimes,</hi> his propoſition was layd aſide alſo. After the Congregation, the Ambaſſadour <hi>Ferrier</hi> did curiouſly demaund of <hi>Augustinus</hi> the tenour, Authour, and time of that priuiledge: who hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it to Pope <hi>Damaſus,</hi> the Ambaſſadour laughed, becauſe it was certaine, that, an hundred yeeres after that Pope, to abſtaine from the Cup was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſacriledge in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the <hi>Romane Ordinarie</hi> doth deſcribe the communion of the Laitie alwayes with the Cup, and that in the yeere 1200. <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third maketh mention that the women did receiue the blood of CHRIST in the Communion.</p>

               <pb n="532" facs="tcp:17208:276"/>
who came the weeke before, deliuering his opinion concerning the Decrees, made a digreſſion in manner of a ſet ſpeach, deſiring the Legates and the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node, that the German Prelates might bee expected, vſing diuers reaſons, but principally three; which were ill taken by the Congregation: that is, That it could not bee called a generall Councell in which a whole principall Nation of Chriſtendome was wanting. That to proceede without expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, would bee accounted a praecipitation. That the Pope ought to write to them, and call them particularly. The good Father knew not that the Pope had dealt with them two yeeres before by <hi>Delphinus</hi> and <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> his <hi>Nuncij</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> nor what anſwers were made by the Proteſtants and Catholiques, the former of which ſayd they would not, and the later that they could not come to the Councell. Some thought he was mooued by the Emperours Ambaſſadours, who, ſeeing that the propoſition of the Cup was deferred, were willing to prolong thereſidue alſo.</p>
            <p>In the next Congregation, nine points of reformation, formerly eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, were read, and, to the firſt, that nothing ſhould bee payd for <hi>Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Nine points of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are read.</note> 
               <hi>Albertus Duimius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Veglia,</hi> who came the weeke before, and was not preſent at the diſcuſſion of the matter, ſayd; that hee held that poynt to be very imperfect, if they did not conſtitute withall, that likewiſe nothing <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Veglia</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a reſolute ſpeach concerning ſome corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> ſhould bee exacted at <hi>Rome</hi> for diſpenſations to receiue Orders out of due times, before the iuſt age, without licence and examination of the <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> and for irregularities, and other Canonicall impediments. For in thoſe things great expences were made, whereas to the poore Biſhops, who haue not whereon to liue, a ſmall almes is giuen; which hee would by all meanes haue taken away, yet ſo, as that they giue not a ſcandall to the world to tithe rue, and ſteale gold and ſiluer. Vpon this occaſion hee enlarged himſelfe, and taxed the payments made in <hi>Rome</hi> for all ſorts of diſpenſations, and added that, whenſoeuer any diſpenſations haue beene preſented to him, either for <hi>Ordinations</hi> or ought elſe, hee hath vſed to aske whether they haue payd for them, and, vnderſtanding that they haue, hee hath neuer executed nor admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them; which hee ſpake publiquely, becauſe it was the duety of euery Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſo to doe. And being anſwered, that they had formerly treated of this in Congregation, and reſolued to referre the reſolution thereof to the Pope, who might with more honour, reforme the Offices of <hi>Rome,</hi> he replied, that, the laſt Lent, hee had ſpoken of it in <hi>Rome,</hi> but particularly in the houſe of the Cardinall <hi>di Perugia,</hi> in preſence of many Cardinals, and Prelates of the Court, and ſaid the ſame things, who anſwered they were matters to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Councell; but now, vnderſtanding the contrary, hee will ſpeake of it no more, but leaue it to God.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond of the <hi>Ordinations</hi> to title, the Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> ſaid it was more neceſſary to prouide, according to the ancient conſtitutions, that none ſhould be ordained without a title and Office, then without a reuenue, becauſe it is an exceſſiue ſcandall, that many are ſeene to bee made Prieſts, not to ſerue God and the Church, but to enioy their eaſe, ioyned with much lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urie, and with a good reuenue, that the Synod ought to thinke ſeriouſly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to finde a meanes that there may not be an Eccleſiaſticall perſon, who ſhall not be dedicated to ſome miniſtery, becauſe hee hath obſerued, that, in
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:17208:276" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> in theſe later times, Biſhopriques haue been giuen to ſome, onely to promore them, who, within a ſhort time, haue reſigned them, remaining ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular Biſhops, onely for ambition of dignitie; which inuention antiquitie would haue deteſted, as peſtiferous. To the fourth point, for diuiſion of great and frequent Pariſhes, after he had commended the Decree, hee added, that it was more neceſſary to diuide great Biſhopriques, that they might bee better gouerned; alleadging that, in <hi>Hungary,</hi> there are ſome which containe 200 miles in length, which cannot be viſited and directed by one man. Theſe things were not well expounded by the adherents of <hi>Rome,</hi> who thought that all were bent to reuiue the treaty of reſidence.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Sidonia,</hi> a man of the ſame Countrey, gaue worſe ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Sidonia</hi> propoſeth metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Pope.</note> propoſing, vnder <hi>metaphors,</hi> the reformation of the Pope himſelfe; ſaying, that darkeneſſe could not bee taken from the ſtarres, except it were remooued from the Sunne, nor the ſicke body healed, ſo long as bad diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions did remaine in the head, which doeth diſpearſe them to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And for the laſt point, concerning <hi>Receiuers,</hi> he ſayd, that it was not honourable for the Councell, nor profitable for the Church to begin with the reformation of the ſmalleſt matters; that the matters of importance are firſt to be handled, the ſuperiour orders to bee reformed firſt, and the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour afterwards. Which ſayings ſeemed to pleaſe many of the Spaniſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and ſome of the Italians alſo. But partly by ſaying that thoſe Decrees were already compoſed, and that there were but three dayes to the Seſſion, which ſhort time did not comport the digeſtion of new matters, partly by making ſuch oppoſitions againſt the things ſpoken as they were able, and by giuing aſſurance, that the Pope would make a moſt ſtrict reformation in the Court, the remedies of the abuſes wherof could be better diſcerned and applied at <hi>Rome,</hi> where the infirmity is better knowen, then in the Councell, and by ſuch like reaſons, the prouiſions thought on theſe and other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, were deluded, and all were made content for that preſent with the nine Articles.</p>
            <p>But, the Congregation being ended, the Legates and other Papalins, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining <note place="margin">The Lgats &amp; other Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult how they may repreſſe the licence of the Prelates.</note> in the place together, to conſider of what they heard, diſcourſed that the boldneſſe of the Prelates, in broaching new ſeditious matters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect, did increaſe dayly, which could not be called, liberty, but too much licence; and that the Diuines, with tedious diſcourſes, tooke vp too much time, contending amongſt themſelues about nothing, and often paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to impertinences, which courſe if it did continue, the Councell would neuer be concluded. Beſides there is danger that the diſorder will increaſe, <note place="margin">In which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentius</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by the Cardinall of <hi>Varmia.</hi>
               </note> and produce ſome ſiniſter effect. <hi>Iohn Baptiſta Caſtedo,</hi> the Speaker, who had exerciſed the ſame office in the former reduction vnder <hi>Iulius;</hi> tolde them, that Cardinall <hi>Creſcentius,</hi> when they digreſſed from the matters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, without reſpect was wont to interrupt them, and to cut off alſo the file of their diſcourſe, to abreuiate thoſe who were too profixe, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to impoſe them ſilence; which beeing now done once or twice, the affaires of the Councell would bee ſhortned, and occaſions of impertinent diſcourſes would bee taken away. <hi>Varmienſe</hi> was not pleaſed with this; who ſaid, that, if <hi>Creſcentius</hi> did gouerne ſo, it was no maruell that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:17208:277"/>
of God had not giuen a good progreſſe to that Councel; that nothing is more neceſſary to a Chriſtian Synode then liberty, and that, reading the Councels of the better times, one ſhall finde contentions and diſcords in the beginnings of them, euen in the preſence of the Emperours, moſt potent in thoſe times, which notwithſtanding did, in the end, turne, by the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, into a maruellous concord: and that was the miracle which did pacifie the world. Hee ſaid there were infinite contentions in the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> Councel, and moſt exorbitant in the <hi>Epheſine,</hi> and therefore no wonder if now there were ſome diuerſitie of opinions ciuilly carried, which hee that would reſiſt by humane and violent meanes, will let the world know that the Councell is not free, and take from it all reputation; that it is good to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the cauſe vnto God, who will gouerne Councels, and moderate thoſe who are aſſembled in his name. The Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> approoued the opinion of <hi>Varmienſe,</hi> and diſliked the proceeding of <hi>Creſcentius;</hi> but ſaid it was not contrary to the libertie of the Councell to moderate abuſes with Decrees, preſcribing the order and time of ſpeaking; and diſtributing to euery one his owne part. This was commended by <hi>Varmienſe,</hi> and they agreed to giue order for it, when the Seſſions ſhould bee held.</p>
            <p>The Imperialiſts were now out of hope to obtaine the Chalice, and their intereſts were ceaſed. But the French men, with ſome Prelates, laboured much that nothing might be done in the Seſſion of the ſixteenth day, but all deferred vntill the next, as had beene done twice before. The Legates, to auoid the ſhame, did labour with all their force to eſtabliſh the points, that thoſe foure that concerne communion, and the nine of reformation, might be publiſhed. Theſe therefore did ſeeke to remooue, and thoſe to interpoſe difficulties. There remaining but two dayes to the Seſſion, a Congregation was held in the morning of the 14. day; in the beginning where of <hi>Granata</hi> deſired the Legates, that, in regard of the importance of the matter to bee handled, they would protogue the Seſſion; and made, as it were, an Oration, to ſhew how many difficulties were ſtill on foot; neceſſary to bee decided. The Legates, reſolute to the contrary, admitted no reaſon, and cauſed the examination of the doctrine to begin: In reading of the firſt point, when they came to the place, where it is ſaid; that it cannot bee inferred by the words of our <hi>Lord</hi> in S. <hi>Iohn. If you ſhall not eat the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke my blood, &amp;c. Granata</hi> began; and ſaid, that that paſſage did not ſpeake of the Sacrament; but of Faith, vnder the <hi>Metaphore</hi> of nutrimont; alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Text, and many Expoſitions of the Fathers, and of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Cardinall <hi>Seripando</hi> expounded that place, as if hee had read in the Chaire; and it ſeemed that euery one was ſatisfied. But <hi>Granata</hi> replied more earneſtly, and in the end, deſired that an addition might be ioyned to it; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that, by thoſe words, howſoeuer they were vnderſtood according to diuers Expoſitions of the Fathers, the Communion of the Cup could not be inferred. This addition did not pleaſe ſome of the Fathers, and others did not regard it; but it ſeemed ſtrange, that after things were concluded, one ſhould come with vnneceſſary additions, to diſturbe the points eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and there were 57. who ſaid <hi>Non Placet.</hi> But, to come to an end, the
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:17208:277"/>
Legates were content, that the clauſe ſhould be added; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>and indeede it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to bee inſerted by force, and doeth begin in the Latine, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tcunque inxta Varias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond point of the authoritie of the Church ouer the Sacraments, when they came to this place, that they might change the vſe of the Cup, by the example of the forme of Baptiſme, <hi>Iacobus Gibertus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alife,</hi> ſtood vp, and ſaid it was a blaſphemie; that the forme of Baptiſme was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable; that it was neuer changed; that ouer the eſſence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which conſiſteth in the forme and matter, there is no authoritie; and much beeing ſayd <hi>Pro &amp; contra,</hi> in the end they reſolued to take away that particle. It would be tedious to relate all that was ſpoken by ſome to hinder the proceeding, and by ſome not to be ſilent, when others ſpake. It is naturall, when a multitude is in motion, for euery one to ſtriue to mooue moſt, neither was there euer any Colledge of Noblemen ſo abſolute, but that it might bee diuided into perſons of honour, and of the common ſort. The patience and reſolution of the Legates ouercame the difficulties; ſo that, in the Congregation of the afternoone, the points of doctrine, and the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematimes</hi> were eſtabliſhed, howſoeuer the Cardinall <hi>Varmienſe</hi> did very zealouſly interpoſe a doubt, at the inſtance of ſome Diuines, who tolde him, that where as it is ſayd in the third point of doctrine, The faithfull are not defrauded of any grace neceſſary to ſaluation, by receiuing one kinde onely; much cauſe of diſputation was giuen, becauſe the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> being not a neceſſary Sacrament, it might bee inferred, by the ſame reaſon, that the Church might take it away wholly. Many of the Prelats adhered hereunto, demanding that it might be reformed, in regard the reaſon alleadged againſt it was euident, and vnanſwerable. Cardinall <hi>Simoneta</hi> did pacifie them with very much adoe; ſaying, that a draught ſhould bee made in writing how it ſhould be reformed, and ſhewed in the next Congregation.</p>
            <p>In that the Biſhop of the <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> gaue new occaſion of diſtaſtes. Who hauing beene tolde our of Congregation, that, in <hi>Rome</hi> Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riques were giuen onely to promote men, returned to that matter, and ſpake of it at large. He ſeemed to declare his minde by way of excuſe, but indeed hee confirmed the things ſpoken, and the end of his diſcourſe was an exhortation to the Fathers, to deliuer their opinions freely, without reſpect. <hi>Simoneta</hi> was much angry at the occurrences of that Congregation, and, when it was ended, did remonſtrate to <hi>Varmienſe,</hi> how contrary it was to the ſeruice of the Apoſtolique Sea, to giue care to the impertinencies of the Diuines, men accuſtomed to bookes of ſpeculation onely, and, for the moſt part, vaine ſubtilties, of which themſelues make great eſteeme, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are but <hi>Chimerae,</hi> where of one proofe is, becauſe they agree not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues: that, before many of them did approue that point, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction, and now ſome broach new matters, which, in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will be oppoſed by others; that it is a plaine caſe that what word ſoe uer is ſpoken, will bee defended by thoſe that fauour the Speaker, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned by his aduerſaries. Neither will they much care though it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dangerous to doe it. But, hauing intimated two Seſſions, and done nothing, if the like ſhould happen in this, the reputation of the Councell
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:17208:278"/>
would irrecouerably be loſt, and therefore that they muſt be carefull to doe ſome thing. <hi>Varmienſe</hi> was ouercome; and anſwered that hee had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to a good end, and that thoſe Diuines were addreſſed to him by the Emperours Ambaſſadours. <hi>Simoneta</hi> perceiued that the honeſty of that Prelate was abuſed, by the ſubtiltie of others, and told the other Legates, that he doubted that the Imperialiſts might draw ſome ſecret from him, and agreed with them to admoniſh him of it vpon ſome good occaſion.</p>
            <p>The laſt day had ſome encounters alſo. For the Biſhop of <hi>Nimes,</hi> at the perſwaſion of the French Ambaſſadours, deſired, that, in the firſt point of reformation, where ſome fee is allowed to the Notary, for the Letters patents of <hi>Orders,</hi> the cuſtome of <hi>France</hi> might not be preiudiced, where nothing is <note place="margin">The Legates. about to part out of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, are ſtopped by the Biſhop of <hi>Girone.</hi>
               </note> giuen. He was followed by ſome Spaniards; and they were ſatisfied; by an addition in the Decree, that the cuſtome ſhould bee ſaued. Other mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were deſired and granted, and all was in order for the Seſſion, the next morning. The Legats riſing vp to depart, <hi>Arias Gallego,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Girone,</hi> came and ſtopped them, and deſired they would ſet downe againe, and heare him. They looked one vpon another; but their deſire to hold the Seſſion taught them patience. They ſate downe againe, with the diſtaſte of many Prelates, eſpecially the Courtiers. The Biſhop cauſing the point of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributions to bee read, ſayd, that it ſeemed to him a hard thing that power ſhould be giuen to the Biſhop to take the third part of the Prebends and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert them into diſtributions; that formerly all was diſtributions, and that Prebends crept in by abuſe; that Biſhops had authoritie to infringe bad cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes; that it was not iuſt that the Councell, by giuing the Biſhop a third part of the authority which hee hath, ſhould take two thirds from him. Therefore hee deſired it ſhould bee declared that the Biſhops haue ample power to conuert into diſtributions as much as they thinke conuement. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Prague</hi> confirmed this opinion with other reaſons, and the Spaniards ſeemed by their countenance to giue conſent. The Cardinall of <note place="margin">Who maketh a ſpeech vnto them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> 
               <hi>Mantua</hi> hauing much commended the pietie of thoſe Biſhops, affirmed, that it was a point worthy to bee conſulted on by the Synod, and promiſed, in the name of the Legates, whoſe conſent he firſt had, that it ſhould bee ſpoken of in the next Seſſion.</p>
            <p>The ſixteenth day beeing come, the Legats, Ambaſſadours, and Prelates went to the Church with the vſuall ceremonies. The Sermon was made by <note place="margin">A Seſſion is held. The Biſh. of <hi>Tiniana</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, the matter of whoſe ſermon was the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Cup, and Reſidence.</note> the Biſhop of <hi>Tiniana:</hi> who, howſoeuer hee was reſolued not to ſpeake then of granting the Chalice, did not forbeare to take that matter onely for his ſubiect, and to diſcourſe that the vſe of the Chalice was common ſo long as the heare of charitie did endure; but, that decreaſing, and inconueniences ſucceeding, by the negligence of ſome, the vſe thereof was not interdicted, but onely it was taught, that thoſe who could hardly auoyd irreuerence, ſhould leſſe offend, if they did abſtaine from it: whoſe example in progreſſe of time, others did follow, that they might not tie themſelues to diligence. In the firſt he commended the memorable example of pietie, and blamed the impietie of the moderne innouators, who to haue it, haue kindled ſo great a fire. He exhorted the Pathers to charitie, and to extinguiſh the flame, and not to ſuffer all the world to burne by their default, to condeſcend to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillitie
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:17208:278"/>
of their children, who demand nothing but the blood of CHRIST. He admoniſhed them, not to caſt away ſo many Prouinces and Kingdomes, to ſpare ſo ſmall a matter; that ſeeing that bleſſed blood is ſought with ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt a deſire, they would not feare the former negligence, for which it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but grant it; that CHRIST would not haue them ſo obſtinate in their owne opinion, as to maintaine ſo pernicious a diſcord amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, for that blood which himſelfe ſhed to vnite them in a moſt ſtrict bond of charity. Hee paſſed dexterouſly from that matter to an exhortation to reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and concluded with the diſtaſte of the others, who deſired to haue thoſe matters buried in ſilence.</p>
            <p>When the ceremonies were ended, the Maſſe-Biſhop read the doctrine, <note place="margin">The doctrine is read, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in four heads.</note> expreſſed in foure heads; containing in ſubſtance. That the Synod, in regard of many errors which goe about, concerning the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> hath determined to expound that which belongeth to the Communion <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>traque,</hi> and of children, prohibiting all the faithfull to beleeue, teach, or preach otherwiſe. Therefore, according to the iudgement and cuſtome of the Church, it doth declare, that the Laickes and Clerkes, who doe not ſay Maſſe, are not bound by any diuine precept to communicate <hi>Sub <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>traque,</hi> and that it cannot be doubted, without preiudice of faith, that the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnder one kinde is ſufficient; that howſoeuer CHRIST hath inſtituted, and giuen the Sacrament vnder two kindes, it cannot be inferred from hence, that all are obliged to receiue it ſo; nor from the ſpeech of our LORD, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſixt Chapter of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> where although there be words which name both kinds, yet there be alſo which name that onely of bread. Beſides, it doth declare, that the Church hath euer had power to make a mutation in the diſpenſation of the Sacraments, ſo long as the ſubſtance remaineth: Which may bee drawen in generall from the wordes of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>the Miniſters of Chriſt are dispenſers of the Myſteries of God;</hi> and particularly in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> concerning which power is reſerued to it, to giue order by word of mouth. That the Church knowing this her authority, howſoeuer the vſe of both kindes was frequent from the beginning, yet the cuſtome beeing changed for iuſt cauſes, hath approued that other, to communicate with one onely, which no man can change without the authoritie of the ſame Church; it doeth declare beſides, that All CHRIST is receiued vnder either of the kindes, and the true Sacrament, and that hee who receiueth one onely is not defrauded of any Grace, neceſſary to ſaluation, as concerning the fruit thereof. Finally it doeth teach, that children, before the vſe of reaſon, are not bound to Sacramentall <hi>Communion,</hi> becauſe Grace cannot bee loſt in that age, not condemning antiquity for the contrary cuſtome, obſerued in ſome places, becauſe it is to be vndoubtedly beleeued that they haue done it, not for neceſſitie of ſaluation, but for other probable cauſes. In conformitie of this doctrine foure <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> were read. 1. Againſt him that ſhall ſay, <note place="margin">Foure <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiſmes</hi> are read.</note> that all the faithfull are bound, by diuine precept, or neceſſitie of ſaluation, to receiue both the kindes in the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> 2: That the Church hath not had iuſt cauſes to communicate the Laickes and the Clerkes, who doe not ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Maſſe, with the kinde of Bread onely, or that it hath erred herein. 3. Againſt him that ſhall denie that All CHRIST, the Fountaine and Author
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:17208:279"/>
of all <hi>graces,</hi> is receiued vnder the bread onely. 4. Againſt him that ſhall ſay that the Communion of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is neceſſary for children before the vſe of reaſon. After this another Decree was read alſo, ſaying, that the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node will examine, with the firſt occaſion, and define two other Articles, not diſcuſſed as yet: that is, Whether the reaſons for which the Church hath communicated vnder one kinde, are good ſtill, ſo that the Cup ought not to <note place="margin">A Decree is read concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning two points, to be handled here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</note> be granted to any; and in caſe it doeth appeare that it may be granted for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt cauſes, with what conditions the grant is to be made.</p>
            <p>During the time of the Maſſe, <hi>Alfonſus Salmeron,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus della Torre,</hi> Ieſuites, diſcourſed, the one with <hi>Varmienſe,</hi> and the other with <hi>Madruccio,</hi> as they ſtood behinde their ſeats; that in the firſt point of doctrine, the matter of the inſtitution of the Sacrament vnder both kindes is obſcurely expreſſed, and that it is neceſſary to ſpeake plainly, and ſay, that CHRIST did inſtitute it for his Apoſtles, and thoſe that ſay Maſſe onely, and not for all the faithfull; that it was neceſſary to inſert this clauſe, to remooue all doubt from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, and all occaſion of oppoſing and calumniating from the heretikes; that they, as Diuines ſent from the Pope, could not forbeare to giue their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in a matter of ſo great importance; and were both ſo earneſt, eſpecially <hi>Salmeron,</hi> who talked with <hi>Varmienſe,</hi> that the reading of the Decree being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>Varmienſe</hi> firſt, and then <hi>Madruccio</hi> made the propoſition; which pleaſed many, but was reiected by the greater part, not for its owne ſake, but for the manner of propoſing it on the ſudden, without allowing time to conſider on it. It did not pleaſe the other Legats, for the ſame cauſe alſo; yet in regard of the honour of the place, they ſaid, without any adoe, that it ſhould be reſerued to the next Seſſion, in the handling of the two next Articles.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the nine points of reformation were read. That for collation of <hi>Orders, Dimiſories, Teſtimonials, Seale,</hi> or any thing elſe, neither the Biſhop <note place="margin">Nine points of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are read.</note> nor any of his Miniſters ſhall receiue any thing, though voluntarily offered. That the <hi>Notaries,</hi> where there is cuſtome not to receiue, and where they haue no <hi>ſalarie,</hi> may receiue the tenth part of a crowne. That no ſecular Clerke though ſufficient, may be promoted to holy <hi>Orders,</hi> if hee haue not a Benefice, patrimony, or penſion, able to maintaine him; and that the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice may not be renounced, nor the penſion extinct, nor the patrimony alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without licence of the Biſhop. That in the Cathedrall or collegiate Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in which there are no diſtributions, or very ſmall, the Biſhop may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, to that vſe, the third part of the profits of the Prebends. That in Pariſh Churches, where much people is, the Biſhops may compell the <hi>Rectors</hi> to take the aſſiſtance of other Prieſts, and thoſe that are large in compaſſe may bee diuided, and furniſhed with new <hi>Rectors,</hi> if there ſhall be neede, and the people may be compelled to contribute. That the Biſhops may make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of Benefices, with cure, or without, becauſe of pouertie, or other iuridical cauſes. That the Biſhops may giue <hi>Coadiutors</hi> to Pariſh Prieſts that are vnlearned, and puniſh thoſe that are ſcandalous. That the Biſhops may ioyne the Benefices of old ruinous Churches to others, and cauſe the Churches to bee built, compelling the people to contribute to the fabrique. That they may viſite all Benefices held in <hi>Commenda.</hi> That the name, office, and vſe of Receiuer be taken away in all places. In the end, the Seſſion was
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:17208:279"/>
ordained for the ſeuenteenth of September, and a declaration made, that the Synod might abbreuiate or prorogue, at pleaſure, as well that Terme, as any other, which ſhall be limited for the future Seſſions.</p>
            <p>The actions of this Councell were not in ſo great expectation in former times, as at this preſent; in regard all Princes had agreed in demanding it, and ſent Ambaſſadors, and that a great number of Prelats were aſſembled, foure times ſo many as before: and had beene begunne now ſixe moneths, and <note place="margin">The actions of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured.</note> thoſe ſpent in daily and continuall treaties and diſcuſſions, with diſpatches of many Curriers and Prelats from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Trent,</hi> and from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> But when the Seſſion came out in print, the vſuall Latine prouerbe, of <hi>The birth of the Mountaines,</hi> was generally vſed by all. And particularly the delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of two Articles was noted; it ſeeming ſtrange, that, hauing made foure Articles of faith, with foure <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> they were not able to declare that of granting the Cup, which is <hi>de iure Eccleſiastico.</hi> Some were of opinion, that it ought to haue beene handled firſt, becauſe if it had beene granted all the diſputations had ceaſed. The third point of doctrine was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered on in the concluſion. For it being ſaid that the faithfull, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the body of CHRIST onely, is not defrauded of any neceſſary Grace, it <note place="margin">Firſt in matter of doctrine.</note> ſeemed a confeſſion that ſome grace, not neceſſarie, is loſt. And here a doubt was made whether there bee any authoritie of man which can hinder the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant, and not neceſſarie grace of God; and if it can, whether theſe impediments bee charitably vſed. Two things were much ſpoken of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the reſt; one, the obligation impoſed to beleeue that antiquitie did not hold the Communion of children to bee neceſſarie; becauſe where the trueth of a ſtory is in queſtion, it is a matter of fact, and paſt, in which there is no authoritie that can alter the things done. Yet hee that readeth <hi>Auſtin</hi> will know that, in nine places, not in a word, but with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, hee doeth affirme the neceſſitie of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> for children, and two of them doe make it equall to the neceſſitie of Baptiſme; yea hee ſaith, more then once, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath held and defined it to bee neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the ſaluation of children; and doeth alleadge for it Pope <hi>Innocentius,</hi> whoſe Epiſtle doeth yet remaine, in which hee ſaith it plainely. And they marueiled why the Councell would, without neceſſitie, trouble it ſelfe here in, to no end, when it might bee ſaid that either it, or <hi>Innocention</hi> had erred. The other was the ſecond <hi>Anathematiſme,</hi> with the declaration, that he is an heretike, who ſaith the Church was not induced vpon iuſt cauſes to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate without the Cup: which was to ground an Article of faith, vpon a fact of man. And they held it a miraculous thing that they would ſay, that one is bound to obſerue the Decree onely <hi>iure humano,</hi> but is bound <hi>iure Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uino</hi> to beleeue it is iuſt, and to make Articles of faith in things which may bee changed daily. Others added alſo, that if the cauſes were ſo iuſt, they ſhould ſay what they were, and not force men to beleeue by terrour, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them by perſwaſion, becauſe that was to domineere ouer the faith, which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo much deteſt. Concerning the points of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <note place="margin">Secondly in point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> it was generally ſaid, that more light points could not be handled, nor more lightly, and that they did imitate the Phyſician, who, in an <hi>Hecticall</hi> bodie, laboured to kill the <hi>itch.</hi> And to put their hands into mens purſes, to
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:17208:280"/>
maintaine Curats, or repaire Churches, ſeemed a ſtrange thing, both for the matter, and for the manner. For the matter, becauſe the Cleargie was luper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluouſly rich, and rather indebted to the Layne for diuers euident reſpects; for the manner, becauſe neither CHRIST, nor his Apoſtles, did euer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell men to make contributions, but onely gaue power to receiue thoſe that were voluntarie. And he that readeth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> ſhall ſee the maſters treatment of the Oxe that treadeth the Corne, and the dutie of the catechiſed, towards him that doth teach; yet ſo, as that thoſe labourers haue no action or right by rigour of Law, nor any <hi>Chancerie</hi> to relieue them.</p>
            <p>The Seſſion being ended, the Legats began to put in order thoſe things <note place="margin">A reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made betweene the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Simoneta.</hi>
               </note> which were to bee handled in the next, purpoſing to anticipate the time, if it were poſſible. Letters came to <hi>Trent</hi> from <hi>Alexander Simoneta,</hi> to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall his brother, and from Cardinall <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> to his Vncle with moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall exhortations, in the Popes name, to accommodate the differences, and to hold good intelligence together; for which cauſe the Sunday after the Seſſion, <hi>Simoneta</hi> dined with the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and made a perfect reconciliation with him. <hi>Mantua</hi> began to diſcourſe of ſome Prelates, who came much to his houſe, whom hee ſuſpected to haue done ill offices againſt him. But <hi>Simoneta</hi> did ſtop him modeſtly, and ſaid, that hereafter they ſhould not ſpeake ſo. They conſulted earneſtly how they might giue full ſatisfaction to the Pope, and the Court, in matter of Reſidence, and what Prelats were fit to bee employed to perſwade others. Thoſe who had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelues to fauour the intereſts of the Pope and Court, howſoeuer they were otherwiſe able, they thought not fit, becauſe they wanted credit. They made choice of two men of ſinceritie, and dextrous in negotiations, the Biſhops of <hi>Modena</hi> and of <hi>Breſsia.</hi> The ſame day the Arch-biſhop of <note place="margin">The Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano</hi> preſenteth the Popes Briefe to the Biſhops, who had written vnto him.</note> 
               <hi>Lanciano,</hi> hauing called together the Prelats who had written to the Pope in their owne behalfe, preſented to them the Popes <hi>Briefe,</hi> full of kindneſſe, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, and offers which pleaſed them all, and did much mitigate their heate for Reſidence. Another accident alſo hapned the ſame day, much in the Popes fauour. For the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Peſcara</hi> ſent vnto his Secretarie a copie of a letter, written to him from the King; in which hee told him, that, hauing vnderſtood that the declaration of the <hi>Continuation</hi> would diſpleaſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and <hi>France,</hi> and might perhaps cauſe a diſſolution of the Councell, hee gaue him commiſſion to make no further inſtance for it, ſo that no decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <note place="margin">The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> wil not haue the <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation</hi> of the Councell, or the point of <hi>Reſidence</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</note> were made for a new <hi>Indiction,</hi> and that the Councell did proceede as it hath begun. Afterwards hee gaue him order to let his Prelats know, that hee had vnderſtood the controuerſie and diſpute concerning Reſidence, and the inſtance they had made, that it might bee declared to bee <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> ſaying that hee commended their zeale and good intention, yet thought that the declaration did not befit the preſent time, and therefore wiſhed them to deſiſt. The Secretarie ſhewed the letter to the Spaniſh Pralats; and <hi>Granata,</hi> hauing exactly conſidered of it, ſaid, that it was well, ſeeing that the Pope did diſlike it; that the King did not know the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it; that hee was counſelled by the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Seuil,</hi> who neuer had reſided, and by the Biſhop of <hi>Conca,</hi> who remained in Court; that hee
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:17208:280"/>
knew very well to what end hee did commaund it, that he would obey him <note place="margin">1562 PIVS 4. FERDINAND. ELIZABETH. CHARLES 9. PHILIP 2.</note> in not proteſting, but would neuer forbeare to demaund it, as often as there was occaſion, knowing well that hee ſhould not offend the King heerein. That point concerning the continuation was ſhewed alſo to the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and French-mem: who anſwered, there was no neede of that declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made expreſly in words, ſeeing that it was executed in deedes.</p>
            <p>In the next Congregation, held the twentieth day, the Sacrament of the Maſſe, and the abuſes conſequent, were propoſed to bee handled. The Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> did admoniſh the Prelates to deliuer their opinions, quietly and briefly, in the Congregations, and without noyſe, and related the rules which they had made for the Congregations of the Diuines, to take away contentions, confuſion, and prolixitie; which, being read, were approoued by the congregation. Afterwards Cardinall <hi>Seripando</hi> diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the manner of examining the points of doctrine, and the <hi>Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmes,</hi> in the congregations, and put them in minde that they had beene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and diſcuſſed before in the ſame Councell, and eſtabliſhed alſo, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not publiſhed; ſo that the Fathers might very much abreuiate their meditations, in regard there was neede of nothing more then of expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Granata</hi> added, that, the <hi>Maſſe</hi> hauing beene handled before, and there remayning much time vntill the Seſſion, the matter of <hi>Order</hi> might be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled alſo. And the ſame was confirmed by the Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches;</hi> which ſome vnderſtood to bee ſpoken ironically, and others, to this ende, that they might handle reſidence, according to the promiſe of <hi>Mantua.</hi> In the ende, the Articles, to bee handled in the congregations of the Diuines, were giuen forth. The ſubſtance of the orders before mentioned was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended <note place="margin">Seuen rules are ſet down, concerning the order of examining the points of doctrine.</note> in ſeuen rules. That, in euery matter propoſed, onely foure of the Diuines ſent by the Pope, choſen by the Legates, ſhould ſpeake, two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and two regulars. That by the Ambaſſadours of Princes three of the ſecular Diuines, ſent by them, ſhould bee choſen. That euery Legate ſhould chooſe a ſecular Diuine of his owne familie. That of all the other Secular Diuines of the families of the Prelates, onely foure ſhould bee cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to ſpeake, beginning with thoſe who were created Doctours firſt. That amongſt the Regulars euery Generall ſhould chooſe three of his owne order. That none of the Diuines ſhall ſpeake aboue halfe an houre, or, if they doe, ſhall bee interrupted by the Maſter of the Ceremonies, and hee that will bee more briefe, ſhall bee more commended. That thoſe Diuines who are not to ſpeake, may deliuer their opinions in writing to the Deputies, concerning the things propoſed. By theſe rules they made account that foure and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Diuines were to ſpeake, and that they might all bee heard in tenne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations at the moſt. In eſtabliſhing and publiſhing this order, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie was what inſcription to giue it. Some thought that to call it a meane to bee obſerued by the Diuines, was to runne into the inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence obiected by that <hi>Spartane</hi> to the <hi>Athenians, that wiſe men did conſult, and the ignorant giue ſentence.</hi> For auoyding whereof the inſcription was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued thus; A meane to be obſerued heereafter in the poynts which ſhall bee examined by the inferiour Diuines, inferring that the Prelates were ſuperiour Diuines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="542" facs="tcp:17208:281"/>
The Articles were thirteene. 1. Whether the <hi>Maſſe</hi> bee onely a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the ſacrifice of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and a true ſacrifice. 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> derogateth from that of the <hi>Croſſe.</hi> 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther CHRIST did ordaine that the Apoſtles ſhould offer his body and blood in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> in thoſe words; <hi>Doe this in remembrance of mee.</hi> 4. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> doeth onely helpe him who doeth receiue it, and may not be offered for others, as well liuing as dead, nor for their ſinnes, <note place="margin">13. Articles concerning the <hi>Maſſe</hi> are propoſe to be examined.</note> ſatisfactions and other neceſſities. 5. Whether the priuate <hi>Maſſes,</hi> in which the Prieſt alone doeth receiue the Communion without other Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, bee vnlawfull, and ought to bee taken away. 6. Whether the mingling of water with wine in the <hi>Maſſe</hi> bee contrary to the inſtitution of our Lord. 7. Whether the Canon of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> doeth containe errours, and ought to bee abrogated. 8. Whether the cuſtome of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to pronounce ſoftly, and in ſecret, the wordes of the conſecration, bee damnable. 9. Whether the <hi>Maſſe</hi> ought to bee celebrated onely in the vulgar tongue, vnderſtood by all. 10. Whether to attribute certaine <hi>Maſſes</hi> to certaine Saints be an abuſe. 11. Whether the Ceremonies, veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and other externall ſignes which the Church vſeth, ought to bee taken away. 12. Whether to ſay that our LORD is myſtically ſacrificed by vs, bee the ſame as to ſay, that hee is giuen vs to eate 13. Whether the <hi>Maſſe</hi> bee a ſacrifice of prayſe and thankes-giuing onely or propitiatorie for the liuing and the dead. It was added, that the Diuines ſhould ſpeake whether theſe Articles were erroneous, or falſe, or hereticall, and whether they deſerued to bee condemned by the Synode; and that they ſhould diuide them, ſo that the ſeuenteene firſt, ſhould ſpeake of the ſeuen firſt Articles, and the others, concerning the ſixe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p>The French Ambaſſadours thought ſtill they had ſmall reputation in the Councell, in reſpect of others; and after that the Decree aforeſayd came foorth were more ielous then before, becauſe mention was to bee made of the Diuines to what King each did belong (which was not done concerning the Prelates) and none would bee preſent for <hi>France.</hi> They doubted alſo that, by this meanes, ſome preiudice might ariſe to the prerogatiues of the Kingdome.

               </note> ſend aduice into <hi>France,</hi> that the diſputation would paſſe onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Italians, Spaniards, and Portugals; that <hi>France</hi> would haue no part, if his Maieſtie did not preſently diſpatch away ſome Prelate, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, eſpecially becauſe matters of great importance, contained in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles propoſed, were to bee handled; which alſo would bee a meanes to obtaine or hinder other things, according to his Maieſties deſire, and the contents of their inſtructions; that vntill then they had propoſed none of the Articles of reformation, becauſe, not hauing ſuffrages to maintaine them, no account would haue been made of their remonſtrances; that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell will not hearken to any thing that as preiudiciall to the profit or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Court; becauſe the Pope is Lord of the propoſitions, it hauing beene determined in the beginning, and euer ſince obſerued, that nothing <note place="margin">And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> may bee propoſed but by the Legates; as alſo of the reſolutions, becauſe ſo
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:17208:281"/>
many Prelats are his penſioners, and ſtand at his deuotion; that it is reſolued, that the Councel ſhall not meddle with reforming the Court, but reſerue that whole buſineſſe to his Holineſſe; that the Spaniards who were very zealous for the reformation, are cooled and put in feare, by the reprehenſion of their King; that there is no hope, ſo long as the caſe ſtandeth thus, to obtaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing but what pleaſeth the Pope, becauſe no inſtance made by all the Ambaſſadours and Princes which are in <hi>Trent,</hi> hath been able to perſwade a good reformation of the Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, howſoeuer Articles, conformable not onely to the vſe of the primitiue Church, but euen to the Decrees of the Popes themſelues haue been preſented to the Legates; that, in ſtead of thoſe, they propoſe points of the preſent controuerſies of doctrine, though they haue been told it is ſuperfluous, in abſence of the Proteſtants, and that, if they propoſe any thing concerning manners, it is of ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and of no fruit.</p>
            <p>The Pope, dayly aduiſed of the diuers occurrences in <hi>Trent,</hi> did feare that no Decree would bee publiſhed in the Seſſion at the day appointed: but vnderſtanding how happlily it paſſed, was exceeding glad; and the more, in regard of the reconciliation of the Legates, and of the letter of the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Hee could not conceale his ioy, but imparted it in Conſiſtorie, and ſpake of it to the Ambaſſadours, and thanked the Cardinall of <hi>Arragon,</hi> brother of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> to whom he did attribute this ſeruice. And being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent to conclude the Councell quickly, and finding that nothing could prolong it, but the points of reſidence, and of the communion of the Cup, he wrote to the Legates, that he was wholly intent to the reformation of the Court; that they ſhould aſſure thereof the Ambaſſadours and Prelates who ſpake of it; and that themſelues ſhould diſpatch the other matters: which they might doe in three Seſſions more. Hee commended them for hauing reſerued power to abbreuiate the time prefixed, exhorting them to make vſe thereof. Hee added, that, knowing it was hard to make a good reſolution in the Councell, in matter of reſidence, becauſe many Prelates, hauing deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered their opinion to a good end, were intereſted in their honour, they ſhould procure that it might bee referred vnto him, and likewiſe ſhould free themſelues from inſtances made by Princes for the communion of the Cup, by making the ſame reference. And if any difficultie, hard to bee reſolued, ſhall happen, in any of the points, which remaine to bee handled, they ſhould propoſe the remitting of it to him alſo; becauſe hee can more eaſily decide any thing in Conſiſtorie, calling ſome Doctors, if there be occaſion, then in <hi>Trent,</hi> where mens diuers intereſts make the reſolutions impoſſible, or very long.</p>
            <p>The firſt Congregation of the Diuines was held the next day in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, <note place="margin">The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> will not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rules.</note> in which the order of ſpeaking but halfe an houre was ſo well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that <hi>Salmeron</hi> the <hi>Ieſuite</hi> ſpent the whole time himſelfe, with much ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cineſſe; ſaying he was ſent by the Pope, and that being to ſpeake of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and neceſſary matters, no time was to bee preſcribed vnto him; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing on the ſeuen Articles, ſpake onely common things, which deſerue not particular mention. The next morning hee was imitated by his fellow <hi>Torre,</hi> who ſpent that whole Congregation alſo, and rather repeated the
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:17208:282"/>
things ſpoken before, then added any thing of his owne. But, which was worſt of all, comming, in the end, to the place of S. <hi>Iohn, If you eate not, &amp;c.</hi> hee ſayd, it muſt needes bee vnderſtood of the Sacramentall <hi>Communion,</hi> and added, that, in the firſt point of doctrine, publiſhed in the laſt Seſſion, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that doubt was made of it, and therefore that it was neceſſary to declare in the next, that nothing is ſpoken of in that paſſage but the Sacrament; and that if any were of another opinion, hee appealed to the Synod. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates were much offended at his ſpeach, as well becauſe it croſſed the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination <note place="margin">With whom the Legates are diſpleaſed.</note> of the Councell, as becauſe it ſhewed a neceſſitie of the <hi>Communion</hi> of the Cup; but much more, becauſe thoſe <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> howſoeuer they were the firſt, would bee excepted both from the generall orders: with ſo much pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulancie. They called to minde the ſtirres rayſed by them in the Seſſion, and <hi>Torre</hi> was particularly noted by <hi>Simoneta,</hi> for hauing written againſt <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharinus</hi> in fauour of reſidence, that it is <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> with inſolent termes, as the Cardinall ſayd. Therefore, the Congregation beeing ended, hee told his Colleagues, that it was fit to repreſſe this boldneſſe, and giue example to others; and they agreed ſo to doe vpon the firſt occaſion.</p>
            <p>In the diſcuſſions of the Diuines all were vniforme in condemning the <note place="margin">The diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note> Proteſtant opinions of hereſie, in the Articles propoſed, and did quickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the others. The diſcourſe of euery one was long, in prouing the <hi>Maſſe</hi> to be a ſacrifice, in which Chriſt is offered vnder the ſacramentall elements. Their principall reaſons were; That CHRIST <hi>is a Prieſt according to the order of Melchiſedec:</hi> but <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> offered bread &amp; wine; therefore the Prieſthood of CHRIST doeth require the ſacrifice of bread and wine. Moreouer, the <hi>Paſchall Lambe</hi> was a true ſacrifice; and that is a figure of the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Eucharist</hi> alſo muſt bee a ſacrifice. Afterwards the prophecie of <hi>Malachie</hi> was alleadged, by whoſe mouth God reiected the ſacrifice of the Iewes, ſaying his Name was holy, great amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and that in euery place, a pure oblation is offered to him; which cannot bee vnderſtood of any thing elſe which is offered in euery place, and by all Nations. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other congruities, and figures of the old Teſtament were produced, ſome grounding themſelues vpon one, and ſome vpon another. In the new Teſtament the place of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> was brought, where CHRIST ſayth to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> that <hi>the houre is come in which the Father ſhall bee worſhipped in Spirit and in trueth:</hi> and to worſhip in the holy Scripture doeth ſignifie to ſacrifice, as appeareth by many places. And the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> asked him of the ſacrifice, which could not be offered by the <hi>Iewes</hi> but in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and by the <hi>Samaritans</hi> was offered in <hi>Garizim,</hi> where CHRIST then was. Therefore they ſayd the place was neceſſarily to bee vnderſtood of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, publike, and ſolemne adoration, which could be no other but the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt.</hi> It was proued alſo by the words of CHRIST, <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you, which is broken for you. This is my blood which is ſhed for you.</hi> Therefore there is a breaking of the body, and an effuſion of blood in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which are actions of a ſacrifice. Aboue all, they grounded themſelues vpon the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who putteth the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in the ſame kind with the ſacrifices of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſaying, that, by it, the body and blood of CHRIST are participated; as in the <hi>Hebraiſme,</hi> he that eateth of the
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:17208:282"/>
hoaſt, is partaker of the altar; and one cannot drinke the Cup of the LORD, and eate of his Table, and drinke of the cup of Deuils, and bee partaker of their table. But that the Apoſtles were ordayned Prieſts by CHRIST, they prooued plainely, by the words ſpoken to them by CHRIST our LORD; <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> For better proofe, many authorities of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were adduced, who doe all name the <hi>Eucharist</hi> a ſacrifice, or, in more generall termes, doe teſtifie that a ſacrifice is offered in the Church, Some added afterwards, that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> was a ſacrifice, becauſe CHRIST offered himſelfe in the ſupper. And they brought this reaſon for the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, and prooued the ground thereof, becauſe the Scripture ſaying plainely that <hi>Melchiſedec offered bread and wine;</hi> CHRIST could not haue beene a Prieſt after that order, if hee had not done the like, and becauſe CHRIST ſayd, that his blood was a confirmation of the new Teſtament; but the blood which doeth confirme the old, was offered in this inſtitution: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it followeth, by a neceſſary conſequence, that CHRIST himſelfe alſo did offer it. They argued alſo, that CHRIST hauing ſayd, <hi>Doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me,</hi> if hee had not offered, we could not doe it. And they ſayd the Lutherans haue no other argument to prooue the <hi>Maſſe</hi> to be no ſacrifice, but becauſe Chriſt hath not offered; and therefore that opinion was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as fauouring the hereticall doctrine. It was alſo more effectually proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, becauſe the Church ſingeth, in the office of the body of our LORD, CHRIST, <hi>a Prieſt for euer after the order of Melchiſedec, hath offered bread and wine.</hi> And in the Canon of the <hi>Ambroſian Miſſal</hi> it is ſayd, that inſtituting a forme of perpetuall ſacrifice, hee hath firſt offered himſelfe as an hoaſt, and hath firſt taught how to offer it. Afterwards many authorities of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were produced, to prooue the ſame.</p>
            <p>On the other part, it was ſaid with no leſſe aſſeueration, that CHRIST, <note place="margin">In which the Diuines are much diuided.</note> in the ſupper, hath commanded the oblation to bee made for euer, in the Church, after his death; but that hee hath not offered himſelfe, becauſe the nature of that ſacrifice did not comport it. And, for proofe heereof, they ſayd that the oblation of the <hi>Croſſe</hi> would haue beene ſuperfluous, becauſe mankinde would haue beene redeemed by that of the ſupper, which went before. That the ſacrifice of the Altar was inſtituted by CHRIST, for a memoriall of that which hee offered on the <hi>Croſſe;</hi> but there cannot bee any memoriall, but of a thing paſt; therefore the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> could not be a ſacrifice before the oblation of CHRIST on the <hi>Croſſe.</hi> They alleadged alſo that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Scripture, nor the Canon of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> nor any Councell euer ſayd that CHRIST offered himſelfe in the ſupper, and added, that the places of the Fathers before alledged, ought to be vnderſtood of his oblation on the <hi>Croſſe.</hi> They concluded, that, hauing to define the <hi>Maſſe</hi> to bee a ſacrifice, as indeed it was, it might moſt effectually bee done by proofes out of the Scriptures and Fathers, without adding ſuch weake reaſons. This difference was not betweene many and few, but diuided aſwell the Diuines as the Fathers, into almoſt equall parts, and occaſioned ſome contention. The former went ſo farre as to ſay that the other opinion was an errour, and required that it ſhould bee ſilenced by an <hi>Anathematiſme,</hi> condemning of hereſie, thoſe that ſay, that CHRIST hath not offered himſelfe in the ſupper, vnder the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:17208:283"/>
elements. The others ſaid it was not a time to ground ones ſelfe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things vncertaine, and vpon new opinions, neither heard not thought of by antiquity, but that one ought to inſiſt vpon that which is plaine, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, both by the Scripture and by the Fathers, that is, that CHRIST hath commanded the oblation.</p>
            <p>All the moneth of Iuly was ſpent by the ſeuenteene who ſpake vpon the firſt Articles; the latter they diſpatched in a few dayes, rather with iniurious tearmes againſt the Proteſtantes, then with reaſons.

               </note> of the other Diuines; layd to prooue the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> by the holy Scripture; and ſaid firſt, that it could not be doubted that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, becauſe all the Fathers haue ſaid it in plaine words, and replyed it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euery occaſion and hee began with the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Greekes</hi> of the ancient Church, and with the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and came, from time to time, vntill the preſent age, affirming that there is no Chriſtian writer who hath not called it a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. Therefore it muſt certainely bee concluded that it hath beene ſo taught by an Apoſtolicall tradition, the force whereof is more then ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make Articles of faith, as this Councell hath maintained from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. But this true and ſolide foundation is weakened, by thoſe who would build in the ayre, ſeeking to finde in the Scriptures that which is not there, giuing occaſion to the aduerſaries to calumniate the trueth, while they ſee it grounded vpon ſuch an vnſtableſand. And hauing thus ſpoken, hee proceeded to examine, one after another, the places of the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, alledged by the Diuines, ſhewing that no expreſſe ſignification of the ſacrifice could be drawen from them. To the fact of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that CHRIST was a Prieſt of that order, as hee was the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, eternall, without predeceſſor, father, mother, or genealogie. And this is prooued too plainely by the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at large of this place, doeth handle the eternitie and ſingularity of the Prieſthood, and maketh no mention of the bread and wine. He repeated the doctrine of Saint <hi>Auſtine,</hi> that when there is a fit place for any thing to bee ſpoken and it is not ſpoken, an argument may bee drawen from the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie negatiuely. Of the <hi>Paſchall Lambe</hi> he ſaid, that it could not be preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for a thing ſo euident that it was a ſacrifice, and perhaps to him that would take vpon him to prooue the contrary, the victory would neceſſarily bee yeelded; and alſo that it was too hard a <hi>metaphor,</hi> to make it a <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and not rather of the <hi>Croſſe.</hi> Hee commended thoſe Theologues, who, hauing brought the place of <hi>Malachie,</hi> added that of Saint <hi>Iohn, To worſhip in Spirit and trueth,</hi> becauſe indeed, the one and the other did formally ſpeake of the ſamething, and were to bee expounded alike, that no difficultie might be made concerning the word, <hi>Adorare:</hi> which certainely doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie alſo a ſacrifice, and the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> tooke it in the generall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification. But when CHRIST added, <hi>That God is a Spirit, and will bee worſhipped in Spirit,</hi> no man that is not willing to expound all things
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:17208:283"/>
in an vnproper ſence, will ſay that a Sacrament, which conſiſteth of a thing viſible and inuiſible, is purely ſpirituall, but compoſed of this, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary ſigne. Therefore he that will expound both thoſe places of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall adoration, cannot be conuinced, and ſhall haue probability on his ſide; the application being plaine, that this is offered in all places, and by all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and is purely ſpirituall, as God is a pure Spirit. And he proceeded, and ſaid that the words, <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you, and the blood which is ſhed for you,</hi> haue a more plaine meaning, if they be referred to the body and blood in their naturall eſlence, then in their Sacramentall; as when it is ſaid, CHRIST <hi>is the true Vine, which bringeth foorth the wine,</hi> it is not meant that the ſignificatiue vine doth bring foorth Wine, but the reall. So, this is my blood which is ſhedde, doth not ſignifie that the Sacramentall and ſignificatiue blood was ſhed, but the blood naturall and ſignified. And that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of taking part of the Sacrifice of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and of the table of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, is vnderſtood of the <hi>Rites</hi> which GOD did inſtitute by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and of thoſe which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did vſe in ſacrificing; ſo that it cannot hence bee prooued that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is a ſacrifice; that it is plaine in <hi>Moyſes,</hi> that, in the votiue ſacrifices, the oblation was all preſented to GOD, and a part burnt, which was called the <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and that which remained belonged partly to the Prieſt, and partly to him that offered, which they did eate with whom they pleaſed; neither was this called, to ſacrifice, but to participate of the thing ſacrificed. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> did imitate the ſame; yea, that part which was not conſumed vpon the Altar, was ſent by ſome to bee ſold; and this is the table which is not the Altar. The plaine meaning of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is, that as the <hi>Iewes,</hi> eating the part belonging to him that offereth, which is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the ſacrifice, doe partake of the <hi>Altar,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> likewiſe, ſo we, eating the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> are partakers of the ſacrifice of the <hi>Croſſe.</hi> And this is it which CHRIST ſaid; <hi>Doe this in remembrance of mee;</hi> and which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid; <hi>As often as ye ſhall eate of this bread and drinke of this Cup, you ſhall profeſſe that the Lord dyed for you.</hi> But whereas it is ſaid that the Apoſtles were, by the words of the Lord, ordained Prieſts, to offer ſacrifice, when hee ſaith, <hi>Doe this,</hi> without doubt it is vnderſtood of that which they had ſeene him to doe. Therefore it muſt be manifeſt firſt that he hath offered; which cannot be, becauſe the opinions of the Diuines are various, and euery one confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that both the one and the other is Catholique; and thoſe who denie that CHRIST hath offered, cannot conclude by thoſe words, that hee hath commanded the oblation. Then hee brought the arguments of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, by which they prooue, that the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is not inſtituted for a ſacrifice but for a Sacrament; and concluded that it could not bee ſaid that the <hi>Maſse</hi> was a ſacrifice, but by the ground of Tradition, exhorting them to reſt vpon this, and not to make the trueth vncertaine, by deſiring to prooue too much. Then hee came to reſolue the Proteſtant arguments, and gaue his Auditors ill ſatiſfaction therein; for hee recited them with force, and good appearance, and anſwered weakely, ſo that hee did rather confirme them. This was aſcribed by ſome to the ſhortneſſe of time which remained vntill night, and others thought he was not able to expreſſe himſelfe better, and <note place="margin">Giueth bad ſatisfaction to the Prelates.</note> the moſt intelligent were of opinion, that thoſe anſweres did not ſatisfie
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:17208:284"/>
himſelfe. The Fathers murmuring hereat, <hi>Iacobus Paiua,</hi> another <hi>Portugall</hi> Diuine, repeated, in the next Congregation, all his arguments, and reſolued them, with ſatisfaction of his hearers; ſaying, in excuſe of his Colleague, that he was of the ſame minde; and the teſtimonies of the Ambaſſadours and Prelates of <hi>Portugall</hi> of his honeſtie, and ſoundneſſe of doctrine, cauſed the Legates not to be offended with him. Notwithſtanding, hee departed a few dayes after; neither is his name in the Catalogues of the Diuines, but onely in thoſe which were printed at <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and <hi>Riua,</hi> before that time.</p>
            <p>The 28. of Iuly, <hi>Iohn Cauillone,</hi> a <hi>Ieſuite,</hi> and a Diuine of the Duke of <hi>Baud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> ſpake very cleerely concerning the Articles; repreſenting all, as it were without difficultie, not by way of examination, or diſcuſſion, but ſtirring vp their affections to pietie. He ſhewed many miracles, which hapned in diuers times; affirmed, that from the time of the Apoſtles vntill <hi>Luther,</hi> no man doubted of it; alleadged the <hi>Liturgies</hi> of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> Saint <hi>Baſil,</hi> and Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> Concerning the oppoſitions of the Proteſtants, hee ſaid, they were ſufficiently reſolued, without which they ought to beleeue they were but fallacies, becauſe they come from perſons alienated from the Church. And, in the end, he exhorted the Legats not to permit, that in any matter whatſoeuer, the arguments of the heretiques ſhould bee propoſed, without adding a moſt euident reſolution; which he that cannot doe, muſt forbeare to relate them; becauſe true pietie requireth, that the reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the doctrine of the Church ſhould not be repeated, before the minds of the hearers be prepared, by ſhewing the peruerſeneſſe and ignorance of the inuentors, and that their arguments are not hearkened vnto but by people of a weake braine; which being done, they may ſuccinctly be rehearſed, with the intermediate proofes, adding the plaine anſwere well amplified; and when it doth ſeeme that ſome thing wanteth, the diſputations is to bee diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to another matter, for feare of breeding ſcruple in the minds of the audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, eſpecially being Prelats, and Paſtors of the Church. His diſcourſe did pleaſe very much the greater part of the Prelats, and was commended for pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Catholike, and that it did deſerue that the Synod ſhould make a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and command that all Preachers, Readers, and Writers ſhould obſerue the rules ſet downe therein. But it gaue ſmall ſatisfaction to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his Prince, who, after the Congregation, in preſence of the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, which came in complement to thanke him for his ſpeech, ſaid, that true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it did deſerue to be commended, for hauing taught how to vſe Sophiſtry, in the ſimplicitie of Chriſtian doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antonius</hi> of <hi>Valtelina,</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> Friar, one of the laſt which were to ſpeake <note place="margin">The <hi>Rites</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</note> of the ſixe laſt articles of the <hi>Rites,</hi> ſaid, that it was plaine by all hiſtories, that anciently euery Church had her particular <hi>Ritual</hi> of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> brought in by vſe, and vpon occaſion, rather then by deliberation and decree; and that the ſmall Churches did follow the <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> and the greater, which were neere. The <hi>Romane rite</hi> hath beene, to gratifie the Pope, receiued in many Prouinces, though the <hi>Rites</hi> of many Churches are ſtill moſt different from it. He ſpake of <hi>Mozarabo,</hi> where there are horſes and fencings after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Moores,</hi> which haue a great myſtery and ſignification; and this is ſo different from the Romane, that, if it were ſeene in <hi>Italy,</hi> one would not
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:17208:284"/>
thinke it to be a <hi>Maſſe.</hi> But that of <hi>Rome</hi> alſo hath had great alterations (as will appeare to him that readeth the ancient booke, which remaineth as yet, and is called <hi>Ordo Romanus)</hi> which haue beene made, not onely in ancient times, but euen in the latter ages alſo, and the true <hi>Romane rite,</hi> obſerued within three hundred yeeres, is not that which is now obſerued by the Prieſts in that Citie, but that which is retained by the <hi>Order</hi> of S. <hi>Dominicke.</hi> For the veſtments, veſſels, and other ornaments of the Miniſters and <hi>Altars,</hi> it appeareth, not by bookes onely, but by ſtatues, and pictures, that they are ſo changed, that if the ancients ſhould returne into the world, they would not know them. Therefore he concluded, that to binde all to approue the <hi>Rites</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> vſeth, might be reprehended, as a condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of antiquitie, and of the vſes of other Churches, and might receiue worſe interpretations. He aduiſed to diſcuſſe the eſſence of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and not make mention of theſe other things. He returned to ſhew the difference betweene the preſent <hi>Rite</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; that which is deſcribed in the <hi>Ordo Romanus;</hi> and amongſt other particulars, inſiſted much vpon this, that, according to that, the Laickes did communicate with both kindes; and ſo began to perſwade the grant of the Cup at this preſent. His diſcourſe diſpleaſed the Auditorie; but the Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> protected him, and ſaid, that he had deliuered nothing vntruely, nor giuen any ſcandall, becauſe he ſpake not to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, nor to fooles, but in an Aſſembly of learned men; to whom no trueth can giue bad edification, and that he that would condemne the Friar, as ſcandalous or raſh, did firſt condemne himſelfe, as vncapable of the trueth.</p>
            <p>The ſame difference which was betweene the Diuines, was alſo betweene <note place="margin">The Prelates are diuided in opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, about publication of the doctrine.</note> the Prelates, deputed to compoſe the Doctrine and the <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> to be propoſed in Congregation. For, in the doctrine, being to alledge the proofes and explications, ſome approoued or diſprooued one, and ſome another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their affections. <hi>Martinus Pereſius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Segouia,</hi> who had beene preſent in the Councell at the handling of this matter, in the end of the yeere 1551 was of opinion, that the ſame doctrine and Canons ſhould bee taken, which were compoſed to bee publiſhed in Ianuarie 1552. and that they ſhould be reuiewed. But Cardinall <hi>Seripando</hi> did not approoue it, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there appeared in that an incomparable pietie and Chriſtian zeale, but ſubiect to the calumnies of the aduerſaries; and that the end ought not to bee the inſtruction of the Catholikes, as the aime of thoſe Fathers ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue beene, but the confuſion of the heretickes. Therefore that they ought to be more reſerued in all parts, and not to meddle with corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the things ordained then; that it was better to begin againe, and not to giue occaſion that it may bee ſayd, that they haue reaped that which was ſowen by others. <hi>Granata</hi> diſſented from all, and would not haue it ſaid, that CHRIST made an oblation in the Supper, or did inſtitute the ſacrifice, by thoſe words, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me.</hi> For the firſt, <hi>Seripando</hi> ſaid, hee did not thinke it neceſſarie, and that it might be omitted, it being ſufficient that CHRIST hath inſtituted the oblation; but yet it was neceſſarie to ſay by what words it was inſtituted, and there bee not any other but thoſe before montioned. But <hi>Iohannes Antonius Pantuſa,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lettere,</hi> was very paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:17208:285"/>
to haue the reaſons of <hi>Malchizedec, Malachie,</hi> of the adoration of the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the tables of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the oblation of CHRIST in the Supper, and euery other reaſon alleadged to be put into the Decree. In the end, after the diſputation of many dayes, they agreed to put all in, that the Prelats might ſpeake their opinions in the Congregations, and that might be taken away which did not pleaſe the <hi>maior</hi> part. They made alſo a colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the abuſes, which dayly happen, in the celebration of <hi>Maſſes,</hi> which were but few in reſpect of thoſe which were noted in the yeere 1551.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth of Auguſt a generall Congregation was helde to receiue <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciano,</hi> and of <hi>Palerme,</hi> are contrar, in opinion.</note> the <hi>Proctors</hi> of the Biſhops of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> that they might honour this ſecond, to the ſhame of the Citie of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which did contend with him for the title, ſaying, hee ſhould not be called Biſhop of <hi>Baſil</hi> but of <hi>Bontruto.</hi> The draught being giuing forth, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Lanciano</hi> was of opinion, that the <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> onely ſhould be publiſhed, and the points of doctrine wholly omitted. He alledged the example of other Counſels, in very few of which it hath bin otherwiſe obſerued, and that this ſame Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the matter of Original ſin, of the Sacraments, &amp; of Baptiſme, did leaue it out. He ſaid it was for Doctors to ſhew reaſons for their opinions, but the Iudges (ſuch as Biſhops in Councel are) were to make their ſentences abſolute; that, if a reaſon be added, not onely the Decree, but that alſo may bee impugned; without which euery one will thinke that the Synod hath been mooued by moſt potent arguments, and euery one will beleeue that it hath beene indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by thoſe which himſelfe doth moſt eſteeme; that it is not ſecure to vſe reaſons, though moſt euident, becauſe the heretickes will oppoſe them, and eſteeme them but little; and the more is ſayd, the more matter of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is miniſtred. He added alſo, that the coniunctures did require a ſudden diſpatch of the Councell, and did intimate, by words vnderſtood by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats and fauourers of the Pope, that by this meanes they ſhould giue ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Holineſſe. <hi>Octauianus Preconius,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Palermo,</hi> who followed him in order, ſpake to the contrary; that the vſe of Counſels hath beene to make a <hi>Symboll</hi> of their owne, vnto which the doctrine doeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, and then to adde the <hi>Anathematiſmes.</hi> That this hauing beene obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this Councell vnder <hi>Iulius,</hi> and now againe in the laſt Seſſion, if it were not continued, it would be ſayd, it was for want of reaſons. Hee ſayd it was baſe, to ſhun the diſputation of Heretiques, yea that their contradiction would make the doctrine of the Councel ſhine more brightly, and that they were not to take care to finiſh the Councell quickely, but to finiſh it well. Theſe two Prelats were ſo tedious, that the night concluded the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they ſaid it was no wonder if a <hi>Daminican</hi> of <hi>Genua</hi> (for ſo <hi>Landiano</hi> was) ſhould be contrary to a <hi>Franciſcan</hi> of <hi>Sicilie.</hi>
            </p>

They complained of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, who if they had ſuffered, as they ought, the point to bee concluded, when the fit time was, it might haue beene reſolued for the ſeruice of GOD, with great concord, before they could haue written from <hi>Rome.</hi> That two thirds of the Prelats did deſire the definition; that all the Ambaſſadours did fauour the truth herein: yet proceeding with modeſtie and charitie, they neuer had the courage to proteſt; They beſeeched his Maieſtie to conſult with godly men about this Article, aſſuring themſelues, that, after mature deliberation, he would fauour the opinion, as being catholike, pious, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for making a good reformation.</p>
            <p>This accident aſſured the Legats, and their adherents, that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to burie this matter in ſilence, ſeeing that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, either by the Kings letter, or by the perſwaſions vſed to them: yea, had declared themſelues againe, by writing into <hi>Spaine,</hi> which made them ſeeme to be inſuperable. The <hi>Papalins</hi> therefore conſulted together, and reſolued to ſend to the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrara</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> a Copie of the Catholique Kings letter to <hi>Peſcara,</hi> that he might procure ſuch another from that King to the French Ambaſſadours, as well to hinder their practiſes to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which they dayly made, as that the French Biſhops, when they came, might not vnite with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as theſe did hope, and expect. And, to diſcredit the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with their King, they reſolued to write into <hi>Spaine,</hi> that <hi>Granata</hi> and <hi>Segouia,</hi> their Leaders, who make ſhew of conſcience, had promiſed their voyces to the Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches,</hi> for the Communion of the Cup, not reſpecting his Maieſtie, who doth ſo much abhorre it.</p>

The Pope anſwered, that the <hi>Engliſh men</hi> and Proteſtants of <hi>Germanie,</hi> hauing declared themſelues that they will aſſiſt the Hugonots of France, it was not fit for him to be vnprouided; that the world was full of heretiques, and therefore it was neceſſarie to protect the Councell, as well by force, as by authoritie.

            <p>The French Ambaſſadours, after they had often made a modeſt requeſt, <note place="margin">The requeſt of the French Ambaſſadors.</note> that their Prelates might be expected, did, the tenth of Auguſt, preſent it in writing. The tenor whereof was, That the moſt Chriſtian King, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to obſerue and reuerence the Decrees of Councels, which repreſent the vniuerſall Church, doth deſire that the Canons of this may be receiued by the aduerſaries of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which thoſe who are not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated haue no neede; and hee thinketh that thoſe which are to bee made, will be more acceptable, if the Seſſion bee prorogued, that, vnto ſo great a multitude of Italian and Spaniſh Prelates, the French Biſhops may be added, of whom, in the ancient Councels of the Church, great account hath beene made. The cauſe of their abſence, which they the Legates haue heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and iudged neceſſarie, will ceaſe quickely, as it is hoped, and, in caſe it ſhould not, yet they will arriue before the ende of September, becauſe they are ſo commanded by the King. And hereby it will come to paſſe alſo, that the Proteſtants, for whoſe ſake the Councell was intimated, who ſay e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day that they will bee preſent in it, will haue leſſe cauſe to complaine, becauſe they cannot require more maturitie in this weightie buſineſſe, nor accuſe them for too much precipitation. They demaunded that, while their Biſhops were expected (that none might thinke that the King did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne that by this meanes the Councell ſhould be idle or diſſolue) they would treat onely concerning manners, and diſcipline, and the two points remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in matter of the Communion of the Cup. They added this laſt clauſe not to diſpleaſe the Imperialiſts, who had hope to obtaine it in that Seſſion. The Legats, hauing conſulted, anſwered in writing; that the prelats of <hi>France</hi>
               <pb n="553" facs="tcp:17208:286"/>
were, before the Councel was opened, expected almoſt ſixe moneths, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was begun, which was principally done in regard of <hi>France,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to handle any matter of weight ſixe moneths more, into which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are now entred, it is not conuenient to deſiſt, becauſe they could not ſo doe, without diſhonouring the Councell, and much incommodating ſo many Fathers; but to prolong the day of the Seſſion was not in their power to grant, without conſent of the Fathers; and therefore that they could not expect from them a more determinate anſwere.</p>
            <p>The French-men then deſired, that it might be granted to them to make their propoſition in the Congregation. But the Legates anſwered, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had been tolde them, and all the other Ambaſſadours, that they <note place="margin">

They alleadged the example of the Councels of <hi>Nice; Epheſus, Chalcedon, Trullus,</hi> of the ſecond of <hi>Nice</hi> alſo, and that the breach betweene the Pope and the Councell of <hi>Baſil</hi> was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they pretended to change this ancient and laudable inſtitution. That this was a kinde of grieuous ſeruitude in the Councell that they could not be heard, and an iniurie to Princes, who could not treate with thoſe with whom they were to manage the affaires of their ſtates; that the Decree al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by them, was not ſhewed, and that it was fit to ſee it, and to know from whom it proceeded. For if the Legates for the time being did make it, they did extend their authoritie with great exorbitancie; if the Synode, it was neceſſary to examine how and when. For it was an intolerable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, which was done in the beginning of this laſt Conuocation of the Councell, that the Legates, with a few Italian Prelats, who came from <hi>Rome</hi> onely, ſhould make a Decree, and practiſe it with rigour, that nothing may bee propoſed, but by the Legates; ſo that the way is barred, to all Princes, and Prelates, to bee able to propoſe a good reformation, which would bee for the ſeruice of God; but in ſtead of that, the doctrine contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed with the Proteſtants is handled in their abſence, without any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Catholiques, who doe not doubt of it, and aliening the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, by condemning them before they are heard. And their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnts were renewed when they were enformed from <hi>Monſieur de l'Iſle,</hi> Ambaſſadour of their King in <hi>Rome,</hi> that, by the Kings order, hee had made the ſame requeſt to the Pope, that the French Biſhops might bee expected all September, and that his Holineſſe had referred it to the Legates. <hi>Lanſac</hi> ſayd, it was a thing worthy of eternall memorie; The Pope referred it to the Legates, the Legates cannot doe it without the
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:17208:287"/>
Synode, and that cannot heare them; and ſo the King and the world are deluded.</p>
            <p>The eleuenth of Auguſt the Biſhops began to giue their voyces, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Decrees in matter of the Sacrifice; and almoſt all did lightly and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformely paſſe ouer all, but onely that ſome did not approoue the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in of the oblation of our Lord, in the Supper, and others did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, andg for many dayes, the number on both ſides was almoſt equall.

               <hi>Iames Lainez,</hi> Generall of the Ieſuites did arriue; about whoſe place, becauſe that ſocietie had neuer been in Councell, there was much adoe. For hee would not content himſelfe with the laſt place of the Generals of the Regulars, and three of the ſame ſocietie laboured to put him forward; for which cauſe hee is not named in the Catalogues of thoſe who aſſiſted in the Councell.</p>
            <p>The Spaniſh Prelats preſented to the Legats a requeſt ſubſcribed by them all; in which, hauing rehearſed many inconueniences, cauſed by the exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant <hi>graces,</hi> and <hi>priuiledges,</hi> granted to thoſe of the <hi>Conclaue,</hi> they demanded a <note place="margin">The <hi>Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> of the <hi>Conclauiſts.</hi>

The Cardinals, entring into the <hi>Conclaue,</hi> where they are locked vp for the election of the future Pope, vſe to haue two ſeruants apiece, one for a <hi>Chaplaine,</hi> another to ſerue in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; which are elected by them rather for negotiations, then to ſerue their perſons, and are ordinarily the beſt Courtiers of <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe oftentimes haue no leſſe part in thoſe affaires then their Maſters; ſo that it hath beene an old vſe, that, when they come out of the <hi>Conclaue,</hi> the new Pope receiueth them all into his family, and giueth them <hi>Priuiledges,</hi> fitting the degree of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, of one kinde to Prieſts, of another to Seculars. Amongſt thoſe which then were vſually giuen to Prieſts, were theſe; that they might reſigne, to any Eccleſiaſticall perſon, the Benefices they held, and cauſe them to bee conferred vpon whomſoeuer they would name; that they might change their Benefices with any beneficed man, themſelues making choyce of the perſons to conferre both the one and the other. By this exorbitant Facultie, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen merchandizing was cauſed, and the Biſhops perceiued that where any <hi>Conclauiſt</hi> was, Canonries, Pariſh Churches, and other Benefices were ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly changed, at pleaſure. The Spaniards complained much becauſe great inconueniences had lately happened in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> by meanes hereof. But the Legates ſayd, that the moderation of ſuch abuſes belonged onely to the Pope, becauſe it concerned perſons of his familie, and that it had beene often concluded, to leaue the reformation of the Court to him, much more of his familie; but they promiſed to write to his Holineſſe, and to deſire a prouiſion: as they did. The Pope conſidering that the <hi>Conclauists</hi> of account remayne at <hi>Rome,</hi> and with the Cardinals, and that the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would touch onely ſome few, and thoſe of ſmall eſteeme, men retired to their houſes, and that it was fit for his affaires, to giue ſome ſatisfaction to the Prelates of the Councell, eſpecially to the Spaniards, reſolued to yeelde vnto them, and, in the next moneth, made a reuocation of many priuiledges granted vnto thoſe, which notwithſtanding was not obſerued by his Succeſſor.</p>

               <hi>Faber,</hi> the third French Ambaſſadour, parted from <hi>Trent,</hi> to returne to <hi>France,</hi> which made the Papalins ſuſpect that he went to giue an account of the Councell, and to ſollicite the comming of the French Prelates: and they thought hee would doe bad offices, becauſe they ſaw his inclination by ſome of his letters written to the Chancellor, which they had intercepted, for the ill ſatisfaction he and his Colleagues had, becauſe they could not obtaine the prorogation. Which being related to <hi>Lanſac,</hi> by ſome creatures of <hi>Simoneta,</hi> to diſcouer the trueth, hee anſwered that hee was gone for his owne parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occaſions, and that it was no maruell, if, the defects of the Councell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo manifeſt, one did thinke they might be related.</p>

               </note> the eighteenth, all contended reſolutely about the oblation of CHRIST in the <hi>Supper:</hi> and Father <hi>Salmeron</hi> was the principall man to perſwade the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue. Hee went to the houſes of thoſe who were of the other opinion, eſpecially of thoſe who had not giuen their voyces, perſwading them to bee ſilent, or, at the leaſt to ſpeake remiſly, and vſed the name of Cardinall <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mienſe</hi> principally, and ſometime of <hi>Seripando,</hi> intimating the other Legates, without naming them. And this he did with ſuch importunity, that the BB. of <hi>Chiozza</hi> and of <hi>Veglia,</hi> complained of it in the Congregation of the 18 of Auguſt. And this ſecond ſpake for the negatiue with very forcible reaſons. Hee told them they ſhould conſider well of it, becauſe one <hi>propitiatory ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> being offered, if it bee ſufficient to expiate, no other is offered but onely for thankeſgiuing; and he that maintaineth a <hi>propitiatorie (acrifice</hi> in the <hi>Supper,</hi> muſt needes confeſſe that, by it, wee are redeemed, and not by his death; which is contrary to the Scripture and Chriſtian doctrine, which aſcribe our redemption to this. And if any ſay it is all one, begunne in the <hi>Supper,</hi> and ended in the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> hee falleth into another inconuenience as great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a contradiction to ſay that the beginning of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and if one ſhould ceaſe after the beginning, and goe no further, no man would ſay hee had ſacrificed: and it will neuer bee beleeued that, if CHRIST had not been obedient vnto his Father, euen vnto the death of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> but had onely made an oblation in the <hi>Supper,</hi> wee had been redeemed; ſo that it cannot bee ſayd that ſuch an oblation may bee called a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> becauſe it is a beginning of it. Hee ſayd hee would not abſolutely defend that thoſe arguments were inſoluble, but that the Councell ought not to tie the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of any, who had conceiued an opinion, vpon ſo good reaſons. He ſaid, that, as hee made no difficultie to call the <hi>Maſſe</hi> a <hi>propitiatorie ſacrifice,</hi> ſo he could not by any meanes be ſatisfied, that it ſhould be ſaid that CHRIST did offer, becauſe it is enough to ſay that hee commanded the oblation. For (ſaid hee) if the Synod doth affirme that CHRIST did offer, the ſacrifice was either <hi>propitiatory,</hi> and ſo it will fall into the difficulties before mentioned, or not <hi>propitiatory,</hi> and ſo, by that, it cannot bee concluded that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie:</hi> yea, on the contrary, it will be ſaid that the oblation of CHRIST in the <hi>Supper</hi> was not <hi>propitiatorie,</hi> and therefore that of the Prieſt in the <hi>Maſſe</hi> ought not to bee. Hee concluded, that it was more ſecure to ſay onely that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Salmeron</hi> the Ieſuit is taxed for proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by faction in matter of faith.</note> CHRIST commanded the Apoſtles to offer a <hi>propitiatory ſacrifice</hi> in the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> Then hee obliquely touched <hi>Salmeron,</hi> ſaying, that, if in points of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:17208:288"/>
practiſes were vſed, it were tolerable, becauſe they are humane, but to proceede by faction, in matter of faith, is not a good example. The Biſhop perſwaded ſo many, that it was almoſt the common opinion, not to make mention of the <hi>propitiatory ſacrifice</hi> offered by CHRIST in the <hi>Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame day the Archbiſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> who came not long before from the Emperour, preſented his letters to the Legates, and letters came alſo from the <hi>Nuncio Delphinus,</hi> reſident with his Maieſtie: both which ſignified, that his deſire was that the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of the Maſſe ſhould not be handled before the Diet, and that the Article of the communion of the Cup might be diſpatched in the firſt Seſſion. The Archbiſhop preſented alſo, in the Emperours name, a forme of reformation. The Popes command, to finiſh the Councell quickly, was ſo peremptory, that the Emperours firſt demand could not bee granted: but hee was partly ſatisfied in the expedition of the matter of the communion of the Cup. For the Pope, vnto whom the Emperour had made the ſame requeſts, wrote to <hi>Trent</hi> that they ſhould doe ſo. Therefore, in the next Congregation, <hi>Mantua</hi> propoſed that, the doctrine of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice being concluded, the communion of the Cup ſhould be handled. As the Prelats were giuing their voyces, it was remembred, that the difficultie, whether CHRIST did offer himſelfe in the Supper, was not propoſed to be diſputed by the Diuines, howſoeuer they haue accidentally ſpoken of it, and therefore that it would bee good to propoſe it, that it might bee diſputed on expreſly, or omitted.</p>
            <p>The generall of the Ieſuites was the laſt that ſpake in this matter; who was wholly for the oblation of CHRIST, and ſpent a Congregation him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, whereas, in the other, betweene ſeuen or tenne Prelates did ſpeake.

Whereupon himſelfe, and the other Ambaſſadours, by commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from him did, at the firſt, put the Fathers in mind to conſider that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian charitie did require, that they ſhould not ſuffer ſo many ſacriledges, and ſlaughters in moſt noble Prouinces, &amp; hinder the reducing of ſo many ſoules into the boſome of the Catholique Church, by enioying the obſeruation of a Rite with too much ſeuerity; that there is an infinite number of thoſe, who hauing not abandoned the Orthodox faith, are notwithſtanding weake of conſcience, who cannot bee cured but by this permiſſion; that his Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Maieſtie is forced to make continuall warre with the Turkes, which hee cannot doe but by the common contribution of <hi>Germanie;</hi> whereof ſo ſoone as hee maketh mention, they begin to ſpeake of Religion, and principally

Then he preſented the Article concerning the Cup, as hee deſired it ſhould bee handled. And it contained, in ſubſtance; that it might bee granted to the States of the Emperour, as they comprehend all <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> This beeing read, the Prelates made a great buſſelling, and gaue manifeſt ſignes that they would contradict. But they were quieted for that preſent, becauſe it was told them, that they might deliuer their opinion, when the voyces were collected.</p>
            <p>The third of September, the French Ambaſſadours made a new requeſt to the Legates, that, to giue more credit to the Councell, and to make the Decrees thereof to bee more eaſily receiued in their Kingdome, they would prorogue the Seſſion a moneth, or fiue weekes, handling other matters in the meane while, to publiſh afterwards in the next Seſſion aſwell that which hath beene diſcuſſed and determined already, as that which ſhall be handled and determined in the meane ſpace; for ſo no time would be loſt, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel would not be prolongued, and the King and the whole Kingdome would receiue great ſatisfaction. Beſides, the Prelates of <hi>Polonia</hi> being expected to come ſhortly, it would bee a thing of much edification to the vniuerſality of Coriſtendome, to ſhew that eſteeme is held of two ſuch conſiderable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. This inſtance was made the day before the Legates receiued letters from the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> that the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> and the French Prelates would come by all meanes, and twenty <hi>Pariſian</hi> Doctors with them. <note place="margin">Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therefore they thought it ſo much the more neceſſary to diſpatch the things already diſcuſſed, that they might not be croſſed with new troubles, fearing alſo that, to the bad humors
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:17208:289"/>
in <hi>Trent</hi> worſe beeing added, and more violent, ſo many difficulties would bee raiſed, that either the Councell would bee infinite, or ſome preiudiciall thing reſolued. But the Legates concealing theſe reaſons, anſwered the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors with honourable termes, in the maner formerly vſed by them. That the Councell was called principally for <hi>France;</hi> that their Prelates had beene long ſince called; that to entertaine ſo many Fathers a longer time, in the ſame expectation, would bee an indignity to the Councell, and that, if the things diſcuſſed were not publiſhed, the world would thinke that it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the by reaſon of ſome diſſention amongſt themſelues, or becauſe the reaſons of the Proteſtants had ſome validity. But <hi>Lanſac</hi> being ſatisfied with no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, and ſtill preſſing the dilation more, complained that the Councell was <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of <hi>Lanſac.</hi>
               </note> opened for the French-men, and yet they were not expected; that hee could neuer obtaine any requeſt of the Legates; that his remonſtrances were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned; that ſtead of gratifying his King, they vſed greater precipitation that hee did not attribute this to the Legates, knowing they did nothing but what was commanded from <hi>Rome;</hi> that they were in an error for ſuſpecting the comming of the French-men; that hauing aſſayed ſo often to obtaine that which was iuſt, and ought to bee granted without demand, it was now fit to thinke of other remedies; and ſpake ſo, as that he made them doubt he would doe ſome extraordinary matter. This raiſed a rumour in the Councell, that it would bee diſſolued. Which pleaſed the greater part; ſome, to free themſelues from the incommodities they ſuffered; ſome becauſe they thought that remaining there they ſhould doe God little or no ſeruice; and the Papalins, for feare of ſome attempt. It was publiquely ſaid, that <hi>Loraine,</hi> vpon all occaſions, had ſhewed an inclination to diminiſh the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that hee would open ſome way for <hi>France</hi> to aſcend to the Papacie, which he thought not fit ſhould be wholly in the diſpoſition of the Colledge of Cardinals, conſiſting of <hi>Italians;</hi> that <hi>France</hi> hath euer pretended to limit the Popes power, to ſubiect it to the Canons and Counſels; that this opinion would bee fauoured by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who already, howſoeuer they were much reſerued in their ſpeaches, had declared their deſire for the ſame and would be followed by many <hi>Italians,</hi> who, becauſe they cannot, or know not how to make vſe of the preferments of the Court, doe enuie thoſe that doe, beſides thoſe who are deſirous of nouity not knowing why; of whom there ſeemed to be a conſiderable number.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Trent</hi> a diſcourſe was publiſhed, which paſſed through the hands of <note place="margin">A diſcourſe publiſhed in <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> all, and was ſent by the Legates to <hi>Rome;</hi> in which it was ſhewed that it was impoſſible to finiſh the Councell in a ſhort time, becauſe all Princes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to prolong it. Of the French men and Imperialiſts it could not bee doubted, in regard of their demand made for the dilation. The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſhewed the ſame minde, hauing deſtinated the Count <hi>di Luna</hi> for Ambaſſadour to the Synode, ſo ſoone as the Diet of <hi>Francfort</hi> ſhould bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to which hee was firſt ſent. The Prelates, by their redious diſcourſes, would draw the matters in length alſo. Then was ſhewed the impoſſibility to continue long in this ſort, there being no prouiſion of corne but for Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember onely: and it beeing not knowen where any may bee gotten, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the generall dearth, and the delay, made by the Emperour and Duke
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:17208:289"/>
of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> to anſwere the demand made vnto them concerning victuals, it did ſeeme they could not bee relieued. It was added that the Proteſtants would alwayes be laying ſome ſnares to make the Fathers fall into ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable reſolution; and raiſing nouities to cauſe Princes to propoſe things preiudiciall; that the Biſhops ſeemed to aſpire to liberty, and would not in time be contained within ſuch narrow bounds, and that the Synode would not onely be made free, but licentious alſo: and, by a fine <hi>metaphor,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of the Councell was compared to a mans body, which doth get, with delight, a ſmall, and in the beginning not regarded <hi>French</hi> infection, which afterwards doth encreaſe, and poſſeſſeth all the blood, and all the powers of it. It exhorted the Pope to conſider well on it, and not to come to a <hi>tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>ſuſpenſion,</hi> for feare of being contradicted by all Princes, but to learne how to vſe thoſe remedies which God doth ſend him.</p>
            <p>Amidſt theſe troubles the Legates haſtened to conclude the Decrees for <note place="margin">Three opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the grant of the Chalice.</note> the Seſſion. That of the ſacrifice ſtood in good termes; but they talked ſtill of the grant of the Chalice: and there were three opinions. One extreame, and negatiue, that, by no meanes, it ſhould be granted; another affirmatiue, that it ſhould bee granted, with the conditions, and cautions, which ſeemed good to the Synode, which was maintained by fifty of the moſt intelligent perſons; and, amongſt theſe, ſome would haue Ambaſſadours ſent into the Countreys which did deſire it, to take information wheth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the grant were fit, and with what conditions. The third, that it ſhould be remitted to the Pope; which was diuided into many branches. Some would haue had an abſolute remiſſion, without declaring whether he ſhould grant, or deny it; and others, with a declaration, that he ſhould grant it, according to his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Some would haue reſtrained him to particular Countreys, and others left him to his liberty. The <hi>Spainyards</hi> did abſolutely deny it, becauſe the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour <hi>Vargas</hi> had written to them from <hi>Rome,</hi> that it would bee for the good of religion and ſeruice of the King, in regard of the Low Countreys and the State of <hi>Milan,</hi> who, when they ſhould ſee their neighbours enioy that liberty, would require it themſelues alſo, and whether it were graunted or denied, a great gate would be opened to hereſie. The <hi>Venetian</hi> Prelates, perſwaded by their Ambaſſadours; were of the ſame minde alſo for the ſame reaſon.</p>
            <p>I will recite the principall Authors onely of theſe opinions, and the things remarkable ſpoken by them. The Cardinall <hi>Madruccio,</hi> who ſpake firſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued <note place="margin">Of which the principall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were.</note> the grant, without exception. The three Patriarches did abſolutely deny it. Fiue Arch-biſhops who followed, referred themſelues to the Pope. <hi>Granata,</hi> who had promiſed the Emperours Ambaſſadours to fauour them, that they might adhere to him in the matter of <hi>Reſidence,</hi> on which he inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted aboue all, ſaid hee did neither affirme not deny, but that it could not bee concluded in that Seſſion, and was neceſſarily to be deferred vntill another, but would not referre, himſelfe, ſaying it was a matter of great deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe it could not be regulated by the Scripture, or Traditions, but by wiſedome onely; wherein it is neceſſary to proceed with circumſpection, for feare of being deceiued in the circumſtances of the fact, which cannot be knowne by ſpeculation, or diſcourſe; that hee made no difficulty, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:17208:290"/>
did, for the danger of effuſion, ſhewing that the Wine is not ſpilt in the ablution which is now made; that, if it would make an vnion in the Church, it ſhould not be abhorred, it being but a Rite, which may be changed for the good of the faithfull: but yet hee reſerued himſelfe, becauſe other extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant things might afterwards be demanded; that, to auoid errour, it would be good firſt to haue recourſe vnto God, by Prayers, Proceſſions, Maſſes, almes, and faſtings: afterwards, not to omit humane diligence, in regard there are no Prelates of <hi>Germanie</hi> in the Councell, to write to the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans to aſſemble them, and examine the matter well, and to informe the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod according to their conſcience. He concluded, that, it being impoſſible to doe ſo many things in a ſhort ſpace, he thought fit to deſiſt now, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the determination vntill another time. <hi>Iohn Baptiſta Caſtagna,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Roſano,</hi> diſſwading the grant abſolutely, ſpake againſt thoſe that made, and thoſe that fauoured the requeſt, taxing them not to be good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, becauſe, if they were, they would not deſire a thing vnfit, with ſcandall of others. And he ſaid plainely, that the requeſt did ayme to bring in hereſie, and vſed ſuch words, that euery one vnderſtood, that hee meant <hi>Maximilian</hi> King of the <hi>Bobemians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> or <hi>Braganza,</hi> ſaid, hee was informed that in <hi>Germanie</hi> there were foure ſorts of men. True, Catholikes: Obſtinate here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes: Concea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That the firſt doe not demaund the grant, yea oppoſe it; the ſecond care not for it; the third deſire it, that they may couer their hereſie, becauſe they may counterfeit in all other things, but in this; which therefore was not to bee granted them, for that it would foſter their errours; but the weake in faith were not ſuch, but onely for the bad opinion they haue of the Eccleſiaſticall power, and of the Pope, and doe not demaund the Cup for deuotion, which is found one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in perſons of a goodlife, whereas they are drowned in vanities and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world, and doe vnwillingly confeſſe and communicate once a yeere, which doth not demonſtrate ſuch heate of zeale that they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to communicate with both kindes. He concluded, that the diligence of the Fathers of <hi>Baſil</hi> ought to be imitated, that foure or ſix Prelates of the body of the Councel ſhould be elected, who, as their Legats accompanied with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines fit to preach, ſhould viſite the Prouinces named by his Imperiall Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, or where they found penitent men, who deſired the Cup for deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or becauſe they were accuſtomed to that Rite, and for all other matters would obey the Church, ſhould reconcile them, and grant it vnto them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Titular</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> though a <hi>Dutch man,</hi> ſaid, that to deny it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demaunded by the Emperour, was dangerous, and pernitious to grant it; but that he was reſolued rather to diſpleaſe men then ſpeake againſt his conſcience, that it was impoſſible to practiſe the vſe of the Chalice, without danger of effuſion, carrying it about, to places remote, and of bad paſſage, many times by night, intime of ſnow, raine, and ice; that the Proteſtants would boaſt, and inclucate to the people, that the Papiſts doe begin to know the trueth; and that, without doubt, thoſe who make the requeſt doe maintaine that the precept of CHRIST cannot be fulfilled, but by taking the Euchariſt vnder both kindes. And he tooke in his hand a <hi>Chatechiſme</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:17208:290"/>
in <hi>Dutch,</hi> which hee read and expounded in <hi>Latine,</hi> and declared what their opinion was. He added, that the <hi>Catholikes</hi> would haue the worſe, and to gaine a few, would looſe very many; that they would doubt on which ſide the true faith was ſeeing the <hi>Catholikes</hi> yeeld to the cuſtomes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; that the grant made vnto <hi>Germanie</hi> would mooue other Prouinces, and eſpecially <hi>France;</hi> that the <hi>Heretiques</hi> will make proofe by this, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſway the conſtancie which they haue found in the doctrine of the Catholike Church. He concluded, that it ought to bee deferred, at the leaſt, vntill the end of the Diet, that the Dutch Prelates might ſend to the Councell, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing the opinion of <hi>Granata</hi> to defer, and the other of <hi>Braga,</hi> that thoſe who deſire the Cup haue all a roote of hereſie; and added, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Ambaſſadours had made ſuch paſſionate inſtances, and ſuch effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſwaſions, that, being intereſted ſo much, it was not fit they ſhould bee preſent in Congregation, that euery one might ſpeake freely. Fryar <hi>Thomas Caſellus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caua,</hi> hauing recounted that the Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> had perſwaded many, ſaying, that if it were not granted, ſo many miſchiefes would follow, that it had beene better neuer to haue called a Councell, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at large, that it ought not to bee granted though the loſſe of many ſoules ſhould enſue, becauſe a greater number would periſh, if it were granted.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Captemberg,</hi> in <hi>Stiria,</hi> deſired alſo that the Emperours Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours ſhould retire, and inueighed much againſt the words of <hi>fiue Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> related by <hi>Caua.</hi> Many of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prelates made the ſame inſtance to the Legats, that the Imperialiſts might not bee preſent in the treaties of the Fathers during this conſultation, it being ſufficient for them to know, in the end, the reſolution of the Synod. But others contradicted; ſaying, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they then others ſhould bee preſent, and that to exclude thoſe who haue intereſt, hath neuer beene the cuſtome of Synods. The Legats, conſidering that they had beene preſent from the beginning, and that they could not bee excluded without danger of tumult, reſolued to make no innouation.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Conimbria</hi> was of opinion, that it ſhould bee referred to the Pope, to grant the <hi>Grace,</hi> with fiue conditions. That thoſe that were to make vſe of it ſhould abiure all hereſies, and, in particular, ſhould ſweare that they beleeue, that as much is contained vnder one kind, as vnder both, and as much <hi>grace</hi> receiued; that they ſhould baniſh the heretique Preachers; that in their places they ſhould not keepe the Chalice, nor carry it to the ſicke; and that his Holineſſe ſhould not commit this to the <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> but ſend Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, and that the reſolution ſhould not bee made in Councell. For when it ſhould be publiſhed it would make the heretikes proud, and ſcandalize ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Catholiques; and therefore, in caſe this diſpenſation were to bee granted, it ought not to be put in the eyes of all nations. The Biſhop of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> maintained that it could not bee denied, becauſe, after the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the Church hauing reſerued to it ſelfe power to diſpence, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſhewed, that ſometimes it would be expedient to doe it; that <hi>Paul</hi> the third had formerly ſent <hi>Nuncij,</hi> to releaſe it, becauſe hee perceiued that the prohibition had done no good in ſo many yeeres; that the Bohemians would neuer be reduced without it; that the vſe of the Cup was conformable to the inſtitution of CHRIST, and anciently obſerued by the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="562" facs="tcp:17208:291"/>
Friar <hi>Iaſper</hi> of <hi>Caſsall,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Liria,</hi> a man of an exemplary life, and learned, defended the ſame opinion. He ſayd in ſumme, that he did not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the diuerſitie of opinions, becauſe thoſe who denie haue the moderns to follow, and thoſe who grant doe follow antiquitie, the Councell of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the third; that in this variety, hee adhered to the affirmatiue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the thing was good in its owne nature, and profitable, and expedient with the conditions propoſed, and beeing addreſſed as a thing neceſſary to reduce ſoules, hee that did deſire the end, muſt needes vſe the meanes; that the neceſſitie of the meanes ought not to be doubted of, becauſe the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror did affirme it, whom he did beleeue that GOD would not ſuffer to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in ſo important a buſineſſe, and the rather, becauſe <hi>Charles</hi> was of the ſame opinion; and the demand of the Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> and of the French-men did prooue the ſame. And if any did doubt that the Secular Princes were not well informed in this cauſe, being Eccleſiaſticall, he muſt needes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches,</hi> and the two other Biſhops of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> who were in the Councell. And becauſe it had been ſayd, that the Father was to bee imitated, who receiued his prodigall ſonne, but not before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, he ſaid they ought rather to imitate the ſhepheard in the Goſpel, who fought, with great diligence, in deſart and mountainous places, the loſt ſheepe, and laying it on his necke, brought it to the ſheepefold. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this Prelate, for the fame of his honeſtie and excellent learning, and becauſe hee was a <hi>Portugall,</hi> whom euery one thought would haue been moſt rigorous in maintaining the <hi>Rites</hi> vſed, did not onely confirme thoſe who were of his opinion, but made alſo very many of the oppoſites to wauer.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Oſemo</hi> who ſpake after him, ſayd; I doubt we muſt drinke this Cup, by all meanes, and GOD grant it may be with good ſucceſſe. <hi>Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Baptiſta Oſius</hi> defended, that this vſe ought not to be granted, becauſe the Church hath neuer wont to grant the leaſt thing according to the poſitions of the heretiques, yea alwayes to conſtitute the contrary. He ſhewed by that which happened amongſt the Bohemians, who had alwayes been the moſt rebellious, that one ought not to promiſe himſelfe any thing of the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of heretiques, but to make account hee ſhall bee deceiued by them, and that it was neceſſary to make the Emperour vnderſtand, that this demaund was not profitable for his State. He deſired the Legats alſo, that they ſhould not ground themſelues vpon thoſe who had from the beginning ſpoken of referring it to the Pope, becauſe they ſpake confuſedly, and that the ſuffrages ought to be collected, as vpon other occaſions, by making euery one anſwer Yea, or No, and to omit thoſe artificiall wayes which ſome had beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to vſe to giue ſatisfaction. Hee was followed by Friar <hi>Iohannes di Munna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tones,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sogorne,</hi> who ſaid, that firſt hee was of opinion that the Grace ought not to be denied, but hauing heard the Biſhop of <hi>Riete,</hi> was, by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, forced to change, and defend the negatiue; that the Councell, which was iudge in this cauſe, ought to haue regard that, yeelding vnaduiſedly to the Emperour, they doe not preiudice other Princes. Friar <hi>Marcus Laureus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Campania,</hi> ſayd, that the Emperour did heartily deſire this grant, but that it would bee ſufficient for his Maieſtie for the gaining of his people,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:17208:291"/>
to make a ſhew onely, and therefore that it would be fit to giue him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the difficulties, that he might iuſtifie himſelfe with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Petrus Daneſius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lauaur,</hi> did not define whether it were fit to grant the Cup or not, but ſpake onely againſt the opinion of referring it to the Pope. He ſayd in ſumme, that perhaps the Pope would be offended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hauing beene firſt requeſted himſelfe, and hauing, either for that hee knew not how, or would not reſolue, referred it to the Councell, it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt argument that hee would not bee pleaſed, if it were remitted to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with the ſame ambiguities; and the Councell which conſiſteth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, may more eaſily beare the burthen of the importunities of thoſe who complaine for want of ſatisfaction, and require a remedie, then the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, who, to maintaine his dignitie, muſt hold an eſteeme of many reſpects. Beſides, it will giue occaſion of calumnies, that the Pope remitteth to the Councell, and the Councell to the Pope, to delude the world. Afterwards he came to Logicall termes, ſaying, that either it is referred to the Pope as ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, or as inferiour; that either the Councell, not daring to reſolue, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the difficulties, doeth remit it to a greater power, or, to free it ſelfe, doth referre it to an inferiour: but neither the one nor the other is fit to bee done, before it be decided which power is ſuperiour; becauſe euery one will hence draw an argument for his opinion, and much occaſion will be giuen for diſputations and diuiſion. Hee ſayd, with aſſeueration, that no wiſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late ought to conſent to the reference, if he were not firſt aſſured in which of the two kindes it ought to bee done; yea, that it was impoſſible it ſhould bee done, but that the words would ſhew either the one or the other. The Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins were impatient to heare this Prelate.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> ſpake in thoſe Congregations, in his place, as a Prelate; and following immediatly after, with other new diſcourſes, he made them forget the former, and making a long digreſſion, perſwaded the grant of the Cup. Then he anſwered poynt by poynt, to all the oppoſitions. Hee ſayd there was no need to anſwere thoſe who would exclude him from the Congregations, becauſe their reaſons were as ſtrong againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour himſelfe, if he had beene preſent; that hee would not anſwere the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of effuſion, becauſe if they had beene remedileſſe, the Councell of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> would not haue reſerued power to diſpence; that the diſcourſes of thoſe who perſwade the negatiue ſeeme vnto him weighty, and effectual, and able to draw him to that ſide, if hee had not practiſe and experience in that buſineſſe, which hath more neede of ſuch knowledge, then of Science and ſpeculatiue reaſons. To thoſe that ſaid, that the like grant did neuer any good in times paſt, he anſwered, that it was quite contrary, becauſe, after the treatie of <hi>Baſil,</hi> many <hi>Catholiques</hi> were preſerued in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who ſtill liue in peace with the <hi>Caliſtini,</hi> and haue lately receiued the new Arch-B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of <hi>Prague,</hi> by whom they cauſe their Prieſts to bee ordained. To thoſe that feared to put new cogitations into other Nations, hee anſwered, that thoſe would not bee moued by ſuch an example, becauſe hauing in them no mixture of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and being deſirous to preſerue the purity of Religion, they would refuſe the Cup, though it were offered vnto them; that the Germans the more it is denied them, the more they deſire it, but if it were granted them, they might
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:17208:292"/>
bee diuerted from that vſe; the feare that when they had obtayned this, they would paſſe to other demands was too ſuſpicious, and if they ſhould, they might alwayes be denied; that it could not be called a nouitie, becauſe it had been granted by the Councell of <hi>Baſill,</hi> and by <hi>Paul</hi> the third; whoſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, had they been more couragious, and not retired from that diſpenſation for ſmall terrors, becauſe ſome impertinent Friars preached againſt them, would haue done more good; that hee was much offended with the reaſon alleadged by ſome, that as no man could be receiued with condition that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication ſhould bee permitted vnto him, no more can theſe people, who would be reconciled, ſo that they may haue the vſe of the Cup. For the firſt condition is abſolutely bad, and this onely as it is prohibited. Hee anſwered the Biſhop of <hi>Sogorne,</hi> that the Emperour did not contend with any Prince, nor ſought preiudices againſt others, and deſired the Cup for his people by Grace, and not by way of Iuſtice. But vpon thoſe who ſayd the care hereof ought not to bee committed to the Ordinaries, but that Delegates were to bee ſent from the Apoſtolique Sea, hee ieſted ſomewhat ſharpely; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whether hee that had the charge of their ſoules, and all the Spirituall gouernement might not bee truſted with a thing indifferent, or whether they thought that this thing did exceed the Epiſcopall gouernement. He ſaid that to referre it to the Pope was to giue him new and continuall moleſtations. To <hi>Philadelphia</hi> hee anſwered, that the Catholiques would not onely not be troubled, but conſolated, becauſe they might liue vnited with thoſe, with whom they are now much troubled. To them who would haue Proctors ſent expreſly, he ſaid, it was no maruell that none came to demand this Grace, becauſe the Emperour had vndertaken to demand it for them, who could make an infinite number of them to come if the Fathers would. But as the Councell was carefull not to make the Safe conduct too large, that ſo many Proteſtants might not come as to put them in fear, ſo they ought to haue the ſame reſpect herein, becauſe more would come to obtaine this grant. His concluſion was, that they would haue compaſſion on their Churches, and hold an eſteeme of the demand of ſo great a Prince, who, out of his deſire of the vnion of the Church, doeth neuer ſpeake of this buſineſſe without teares. In the ende, he ſhewed griefe for the paſſion of many Prelats, who, for a vaine feare of ſeeing a change in their owne Countreys, were content with the loſſe of others. In particular he complained of the Biſhop of <hi>Rieti,</hi> who held the Emperour for a Prince ignorant in gouernement, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was good for his States, which hee ſayd his moſt Reuerend Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, accuſtomed to ſerue at the Cardinals tables in <hi>Rome,</hi> could not teach him. Finally, hee ſayd, that many other things did remaine to bee anſwered, which were ſpoken as to challenge him to a <hi>Duell;</hi> but hee thought it better to beare them, and paſſe them ouer with patience. Hee repeated that which hee had ſayd before; that is, that if the Cup were not graunted, it had beene better that the Councell had neuer beene called: which hee expounded thus, that much people remained in obedience to the Pope, hoping that this Grace would in the Councell bee graunted vnto them, who would wholly aliene themſelues when they ſaw they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded.</p>

               <hi>Andreas di Cueſta,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lion</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſayd, that the good intention of the Emperour and Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> could not be doubted of, nor diſputed whether the Councell might giue ſuch a permiſſion, but that it was onely to bee conſidered what was expedient. His opinion was that the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and continuall vſe of the Church, neuer to yeeld to the petitions of the <hi>heretikes,</hi> was to bee imitated. It appeared by the practiſe of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, that, howſoeuer the world went topſie turuie, they would neuer graunt any thing vnto them, and the Doctours abſtained from words vſed by the <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes,</hi> though they had a good ſence; that they would neuer haue been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with this grant; that the <hi>Catholikes</hi> would take it ill; that for an vncertaine hope of reducing a few <hi>heretikes,</hi> many <hi>Catholikes</hi> would be loſt, that becauſe the Biſhops of <hi>Germanie</hi> did not make the demand, it was a great argument that it proceeded not from deuotion, comming from a people who giue no ſigne of any ſpiritualitie; that he could not vnderſtand how they were peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and would returne to the Church, beleeuing it was gouerned by the holy Ghoſt, and yet be obſtinate not to doe it without this fauour; that this obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie ſheweth, that they haue not the formall reaſon of faith; that if the Councell of <hi>Baſil</hi> did formerly grant this to the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> it was becauſe they did abſolutely referre themſelues to the Church, which, afterwards, in kindneſſe, did graunt it; that it ought not to be called a true remedie which is not neceſſarie, by the nature of the thing, but by the malice of men, that the Synode ought not to nouriſh nor cheriſh them, that the example of CHRIST, in ſeeking the wandring ſheepe, is ſufficiently imitated, when they are called, inuited, and prayed; that if this fauour muſt bee graunted, it were better to bee done by the Pope, who may reuoke it if the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons bee not performed; that the Councell granting it, if the Pope would afterwards recall it, they will pretend he cannot doe it, and that his authority is not aboue the Councel; that the <hi>heretikes</hi> doe euer proceede with falſhoods and deceits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antonius Coronicius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Almeria,</hi> ſaid, that hee was confirmed in the negatiue by the reaſon vſed by the defenders of the affirmatine; that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer God giueth many helpes to the impenitent, as preaching, miracles; and good inſpirations, yet hee giueth the Sacraments to the penitent onely; that if they would bee mooued with charitie, they ſhould bee more carefull to preſerue the <hi>Catholikes</hi> then reduce the <hi>heretikes;</hi> that the Councell of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> ought to bee imitated, which to maintaine the good children of the Church, prohibited the Communion of the Chalice, taught by <hi>Iohn Huſſe;</hi> that now they ought ſo to deale with the Lutherans; that this grant would open a gate to infinite miſchiefes; that they would demaund marriage of Prieſts, abrogation of images, of faſts, and of other godly conſtitutions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes propoſing their demands as the onely and neceſſary remedies to vnite them to the Church; that euery little change of the Law doeth breede great dammage, eſpecially if it bee made in fauour of <hi>heretikes;</hi> that hee would not giue counſell that the Pope ſhould doe it, though hee might doe it better; that the people would bee leſſe offended then if the graunt were made by the Councell, howſoeuer it ought to bee confeſſed that the ſupreame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is in the Pope; that in caſe he ſhould graunt it, it ought not to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:17208:293"/>
to the Biſhops though knowen to bee worthy for ſome time, becauſe they may become bad, &amp; of a peruerſe faith, moued by their priuate intereſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franciſcus di Gado,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lugo</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> made a long exhortation to the Fathers, that, to auoyde difficulties, or to giue ſatisfaction to Prince or people, they would not derogate from the reputation and dignitie of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels, whoſe authoritie hauing euer been eſteemed in the Church, as euery one knoweth, and that hauing maintained the faith, was not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned now, for reſpects and intereſts. He alleadged many places of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> for authoritie of generall Councels, and much extolled the authoritie of them; and howſoeuer hee neuer deſcended to compare it with the Popes, yet euery one vnderſtood that hee made it the ſuperiour. And <hi>Ierolamus Guerini,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Imola,</hi> vſing the like conceits and words, extolled alſo the authoritie of Prouinciall Councels, to confirme his opinion of not graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Cup, and ſayd, that their authoritie ought to be eſteemed obligatory, vntill the contrary was determined by a generall Councell; alleadging Saint <hi>Austin</hi> for it. In heate of ſpeaking, hee came out with theſe words, that the generall Councell had no ſuperiour; but perceiuing afterwards that the <hi>Papalins</hi> (of which number himſelfe was) were offended, ſought to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it, by repeating the ſame things, and adding an exception of the Popes authoritie. By which meanes hee ſatisfied neither partie; but the greater number did excuſe him, and attribute it to inconſideration, becauſe, in the former congregations, he had, vpon diuers occaſions, confuted thoſe who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged the Councell of <hi>Baſil.</hi> Notwithſtanding Cardinall <hi>Simoneta,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he imployed him to make ſuch oppoſitions, did not forbeare to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it in a bad ſence, and to charge him that hee was transported by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, becauſe the Buls of his Biſhoprike were not diſpatched vpon free coſt, as he would haue had them.</p>
            <p>The laſt congregation concerning this point was held the fift of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and, amongſt others, <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſelli,</hi> a <hi>Preualentian Abbat,</hi> and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Canon in <hi>Geneua,</hi> maintaining the negatiue, ſayd, that this matter was diſputed many dayes in the Councell of <hi>Baſil,</hi> which diſputation remaineth ſtill, collected by Friar <hi>Iohn,</hi> of <hi>Raguſi,</hi> Proctor of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> and, in concluſion, the Cup was abſolutely denied to the <hi>Bohemians:</hi> ſo that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther determination can now bee made, without declaring to the world that the Church did then erre, in a generall Councell. Hee was reprehended by the Biſhop of <hi>Imola</hi> (to ſalue his owne ſore) for giuing authoritie to that ſchiſmaticall Councell, and noted of great boldneſſe, that thoſe who ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply alleadged the Councell of <hi>Baſil</hi> hauing beene often reprooued, he ſhould not onely cite it, but giue it the authoritie of a generall Councell. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The authority of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Baſil.</hi>
               </note> replied that he alwayes marueiled, and then more then euer, how any one could ſpeake ſo of that Councell, conſidering that the foureteene Articles decreed in the matter of the Chalice the laſt Seſſion were wholly taken out of it, and that hee knew not how a Decree could more be approued, then by renewing of it not onely in ſence, but in words alſo. And waxing warme herewith, hee ſayd, that, in regard of the Decree of that Councell, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Cup ſauoured of hereſie, and mortall ſinne. Whereupon a buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing was raiſed among the Prelates; and he deſiring to proceed was ſilenced
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:17208:293"/>
by the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſo that ſtopping himſelfe hee asked pardon, and ſpeaking a few words, concluded.</p>
            <p>Not to ſpeake any more of this Father, I will adde heere, that hee was noted to haue been at the French Ambaſſadours houſe, the ſixteenth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, early in the morning, to demand whether their Biſhops would come, and to exhort that they might bee ſollicited to come quickly. And in the Congregations, in which the ſacrifice was handled, hee propoſed the doubt whether the authority of the Pope bee aboue the Councell; adding, that when it ſhould bee diſcuſſed, hee would ſpeake freely. Theſe things bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put together, and duely weighed, the Legates did not thinke fit that the French-men ſhould finde at their comming ſuch a humour in <hi>Trent,</hi> and thought to make his Generall recall him, for buſineſſe of the Congregation, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Verſells</hi> dieth with griefe.</note> and ſo to remooue him honeſtly. But there was no neede; for the poore Father fell ſicke a little after with griefe of minde, and the twentie ſixth of Nouember died. In that Congregation Friar <hi>Iohn Baptiſta,</hi> Generall of the <hi>Serui,</hi> maintaining the negatiue alſo, to ouerthrow the ground of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, <note place="margin">The Generall of the <hi>Serui</hi> extolleth the Councell of <hi>Conſtance.</hi>
               </note> ſpake at large concerning the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> which firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that matter, and commended the authority thereof; exalting it aboue other generall Councels, and ſaying that it had depoſed three Popes. This did not pleaſe; but was paſſed ouer, becauſe they would not thruſt many matters together.</p>
            <p>The giuing of voyces beeing ended, the Legates were deſirous to giue the <note place="margin">The Cup is denied, by pluralitie of voyces.</note> Emperor ſatisfaction, but could not, becauſe the party of the negatiue preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: they reſolued therefore to labour that it might bee referred to the Pope, hoping that, by perſwaſions, ſome of the negatiue might be drawen into that middle opinion. And they gaue commiſſion to <hi>Iacobus Lomelinus,</hi> B. of <hi>Maz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zara,</hi> and to the Biſhop of <hi>Ventimiglia,</hi> to imploy themſelues herein, with dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie and circumſpection. The Legates themſelues ſpake with the three Patriarches, and perſwaded them; by whoſe meanes all the Prelates and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Venetian State were pacified, which was a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Hauing gayned as many as ſeemed ſufficient, they beleeued they had ouercome the difficulty. They brought the matter to this point, to write a letter to the Pope in the ordinary forme, and to ſend a note of all the voyces. But the Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> did not approue it, except a Decree of the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion did appeare. For theſe two Articles hauing been reſerued in the laſt Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be handled in this, and they now beeing handled, and reſolued, it is neceſſary that the reſolution of the Seſſion ſhould appeare in the Actes. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armienſe</hi> ſhewed him how hard and dangerous it was to propoſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and that he ought to bee content with the letter, if hee deſired to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. The Biſhop not beeing pacified herewith, they reſolued to make a Decree, to bee read in the Seſſion; in which hee deſired it ſhould bee ſayd, That the Synode, knowing it is expedient to grant the vſe of the Cup, did referre vnto the Pope to grant it, to whom, and vpon what conditions hee pleaſed. The Legates ſhewed him that many who were for the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did doubt whether it were expedient, and therefore would oppoſe the Decree, ſo that it was impoſſible to cauſe any ſuch declaration to bee made; and that, if hee were firme in this opinion, it were better to let a weeke paſſe,
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:17208:294"/>
that this great heat might bee cooled. The Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> was content; and ſo, this point beeing deferred, they purpoſed to eſtabliſh the Decree of the Sacrifice, that this beeing ioyned with it, they might make the propoſition for the Communion. <hi>Varmienſe</hi> did oppoſe, who beeing perſwaded by the <hi>Ieſuites, Laynez, Salmeron</hi> and <hi>Torre,</hi> did propoſe another forme of Decree for the Sacrifice in matter of the oblation of CHRIST in the <hi>Supper,</hi> and they had much adoe to make him deſiſt. Finally, beeing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt out of hope to bee ready to hold the Seſſion at the time appointed, the Decree of the Sacrifice was eſtabliſhed in the Congregation of the ſeuenth day by conſent of the maior part, howſoeuer <hi>Granata</hi> laboured to interpoſe impediments and delayes.</p>
            <p>After this, tenne Articles for reformation of the abuſes, occurring in the <hi>Maſse,</hi> were propoſed, and eleuen more in diuers other points of reformation; which were purpoſely choſen of eaſie matters, not ſubiect to contradiction, and fauourable to the authoritie of Biſhops, that their proceeding might not bee hindered by the oppoſition of any; which was well knowen to the Ambaſſadours and Prelates who complained of it. Theſe began to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled the ninth of September, and the Prelates deliuered their opinions brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, fourty in a Congregation. There was no remarkable oppoſition, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Philadelphia</hi> ſayd, that <hi>Germany</hi> expected that matters of weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance ſhould be handled in Councell. Hee named diuers, and, amongſt others, the creation of Cardinals, and pluralitie of Benefices. <hi>Ioannes Zuares,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conimbria,</hi> ſayd, that ſmall matters were not to bee neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but thought that the dignitie of the Synode did require that ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall order ſhould bee followed, that it may appeare why theſe particulars <note place="margin">The Councel is taxed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Prelates, for omitting the chiefe points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> are propoſed before others; that the reformation ought to begin from the Head, and paſſe to the Cardinals; from the Cardinals to the Biſhops; and from them to other degrees; otherwiſe he feared that the Catholikes would be offended, and the proteſtants laugh. <hi>Paris</hi> ſayd, that, for theſe hundred and fiftie yeeres, the world hath demanded a reformation in the Head, and the members, and hitherto hath beene deceiued; that now it was time they ſhould labour in earneſt, and not by diſſimulation; that he deſired the French men ſhould bee heard for the neceſſities of that Kingdome; that in <hi>France</hi> a farre more profitable reformation was made, then that which was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Councell. The Biſhop of <hi>Segouia</hi> ſayd, they did imitate an vnskilfull Phyſician, who gaue a lenitiue, or anointed with oyle, in mortall diſeaſes. The Biſhop of <hi>Oreate</hi> ſayd, that the Pope ought not to grant ſo great faculty to the <hi>Cruſado,</hi> and the <hi>Fabrique</hi> of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> by vertue of which, euery one in <hi>Spaine</hi> will haue <hi>Maſſes</hi> in his houſe, which if it be not moderated, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions of the Councell will bee in vaine; that it was neceſſary to declare that the Decrees of the generall Councell doe binde the Head alſo. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at buzzing beeing raiſed, hee made a ſigne they ſhould bee ſilent, and added, that hee meant in reſpect of the direction, and not of coaction. He procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſayd that it was neceſſary to finde a meanes to take away contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſuits, or, at the leaſt, to make them fewer and ſhorter, in cauſes of Benefices; that this cauſed great expences, hindered the worſhip of GOD, and ſcandalized the people. The Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> ſpake concerning the
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:17208:294"/>
point of conferring Biſhopriques, expounding the wordes hee had ſaid, that baſe and vnworthy perſons were promoted, and declaring that the abuſe proceeded from Princes, who did importunately recommend them to the Pope, ſaying they would bee better beſtowed vpon the horſe-keepers of his Holineſſe. And he complained that his words had been ill expounded.</p>
            <p>The Spaniſh Agent complained in the Kings name, that in the eight Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle too much authority was giuen to Biſhops ouer <hi>Hospitals, Mountaines</hi> of pietie, and ſuch places; and particularly in <hi>Sicilia,</hi> againſt the priuiledge which that Kingdome aunciently hath; for whoſe ſatisfaction the Legates cauſed a clauſe to bee added for reſeruation of the places which are immediately vnder the protection of the King. Theſe things bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, the Legates were in a ſtrait, becauſe there were but three dayes to the Seſſion, and many things vnreſolued, eſpecially that which was of greateſt importance, in which euery one was carried with a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrong affection, that is the communion of the Cup. But one accident made them to prolong the time. For the French Ambaſſadour in <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing earneſtly deſired the Pope in the Kings name, to cauſe a delay vntill the comming of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, his Holineſſe, though nothing could more diſpleaſe him then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing of the Councell, aſwell in regard of his owne inclination, as of the Cardinals and Court, who were in hope, and much deſired to ſee it ended in December, notwithſtanding, to conceale his feares, did anſwere, that it was all one to him, and that it did depend on the Prelates, who if they did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre euery delay, it was no maruell, in regard of their long and incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious abiding there, ſaying that they ought to be reſpected, and that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could nor would compell them, or impoſe a law vpon them, contrary to the ancient vſe; that hee would write to the Legates, concerning this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſhew hee was contented with the dilation; that this is all that can be required of him, and enough to ſatisfie the King. Thus he wrote, adding that they ſhould make vſe of this permiſſion; as it ſhould ſeeme moſt reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the Fathers. This letter, and the backwardneſſe in their buſineſſe, and that which was written by <hi>Delphinus, Nuncio</hi> with the Emperour, and the inſtance of the Emperours Ambaſſadours, that the Decree of the <hi>Maſse,</hi> might not bee publiſhed, made ſome of the Legates incline to deferre the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But <hi>Simoneta,</hi> who vnderſtood the Popes minde, rather as it was in his head, then as it was expreſſed in the letter, oppoſed ſo ſtrongly, that the contrary was reſolued. And he ſent aduice to <hi>Rome</hi> how dangerous a thing it was to change the abſolute commands formerly giuen, to come quickly to the concluſion of the Councell, onely to giue verball ſatisfaction to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, encouraging thoſe who had bad intentions to croſſe good reſolutions, and laying burthens vpon them to make them odious, to loſe reputation, and to make them vnfit to doe the ſeruice of his Holineſſe. <hi>Simoneta</hi> was fauoured by the euent. For, there beeing no oppoſition of moment, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the abuſes of the <hi>Maſse</hi> was eſtabliſhed, together with the eleuonth of reformation, and the Decree of the Communion had leſſe difficulty then was beleeued. It did not paſſe at the firſt propoſing, becauſe it ſaid, that the Pope, by conſent and approbation of the Councell, ſhould doe what he thought good. This was impugned by thoſe who held the negatiue, and
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:17208:295"/>
the remiſſiue part; which made the Legats reſolue to omit this matter whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and excuſed themſelues to the Imperialiſts, becauſe the fault did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed either from the Pope, or from them. The Ambaſſadours deſired that it ſhould bee propoſed without the clauſe of conſent and approbation; which the Legates thinking would cauſe a delay of the Seſſion, did refuſe. The Ambaſſadours proteſted, that ſeeing ſo ſmall eſteeme was held of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, they would aſſiſt no more either in Congregation or Seſſion, vntill his Maieſtie aduiſed hereof, had giuen thoſe orders that befitted the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dignity. Hereupon the Legates were content, not onely to propoſe it againe without the clauſe, but to vſe perſwaſions themſelues, alſo, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy others. And the day following, which was the next day before the <note place="margin">The grant of the Cup is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Pope.</note> Seſſion, the Decree, corrected, did paſſe by the maior part (though contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by all of the negatiue) to the great ioy of the Legats and Papalins, aſwell becauſe the Seſſion was not prolonged, which they greatly feared, as alſo becauſe they thought it more honour for the Pope, that the <hi>grace</hi> ſhould totally depend on his authority. The Ambaſſadours were well ſatisfied with this particular; but perceiuing that the Seſſion would bee in order, and that the publication of the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> could not bee hindered, as they had deſired in the Emperours name, they ioyned with the French-men, who were mal-content, becauſe the requeſt which their King had made in <hi>Rome</hi> was denied. Therefore the ſame day, in the afternoone, all the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours <note place="margin">A generall conſultation of the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours.</note> met in the houſe of the Imperialiſts, ſaying they would conſult of a thing common to all Princes. The Venetians and Florentiue, beeing called, excuſed themſelues, ſaying they could not come, without expreſſe commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from their Maſters. In that Aſſembly, the Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> made a long diſcourſe, to ſhew, that hitherto nothing of worth had beene handled in the Councel; that they had vainely diſputed of points of doctrine, which did the heretiques no good, who were reſolued not to change their opinion, nor the Catholiques, who are ſufficiently perſwaded already that, for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, nothing hath beene propoſed but things of no moment, of Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Receiuers, and ſuch like; that it did plainely appeare, that the Legates would make the next Seſſion according to the ſame ſtile, and afterwards ſpend the time in diſputes, deciding of Doctrines, making Canons, of <hi>Order, Marriage,</hi> or ſome other ſleight matter, to auoyd, as they haue done the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall points of reformation. And, by theſe and other reaſons, well am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified, he perſwaded the Ambaſſadours to ioyne together, and to goe to the Legats, and deſire that for that Seſſion they would omit to ſpeak of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of doctrines, or canons, becauſe it was now time to thinke vpon a good reformation, to take away ſo great abuſes, to correct bad manners, and to labour that the Councell may not bee vnfruitfull. The Spaniſh Secretary would not aſſent. For his King, deſiring that the <hi>continuation</hi> ſhould bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the end of the Councel, feared hee ſhould preiudice himſelfe, if the manner of proceeding, which was to handle the doctrine and reformation together, ſhould be changed, becauſe that alteration might bee vſed for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that it was a new Councel. The Ambaſſadour of <hi>Portugal,</hi> hauing made a long vnconcluding ſpeech, to ſhew he deſired a reformation, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more pleaſing termes, retired from the company. The Suſſe, ſeeing the
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:17208:295"/>
examples of thoſe two, and that the Venetians were not preſent, fearing to commit an errour, ſaid, it were good to conſider of it againe, before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued. All the others were reſolute to goe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lanſac</hi> (by conſent) ſpake for them all; ſaying, They were ſent by their Princes to aſſiſt and fauour the Councell, and to procure that the proceeding ſhould bee pertinent, not by diſputing of doctrine, whereof none of them; being Catholikes, doe doubt, and is ſuperfluous, in abſence of thoſe who doe <note place="margin">Who chooſe <hi>Lanſac</hi> to ſpeake for them.</note> impugne it, but by making a good, holy, and abſolute reformation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Now, becauſe, notwithſtanding all their remonſtrances, they ſaw they would determine principall points of controuerſed doctrine, and touch the reformation but ſlightly, he prayed them to change their purpoſe, and to employ the next Seſſion in reformation onely, propoſing more important and neceſſary Arguments then thoſe whereof hitherto they had ſpoken. The Legates anſwered in the vſuall forme; That the deſire of the Pope and <note place="margin">The anſwere of the Legats.</note> theirs was to doe the ſeruice of God, procure the good of the Church, and ſatisfie and gratifie all Princes; but yet that it was not conuenient to breake the order alwayes obſerued in the Councell to handle doctrine and reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion together; that the things already done were but a beginning; that they had a good intention to doe better; that they would moſt readily receiue the Articles which the Ambaſſadours would propoſe; that they maruelled that the Articles determined at <hi>Poiſi</hi> in <hi>France</hi> were not ſent to the Pope, who would haue approued them. <hi>Lanſac</hi> replied, that the Pope hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all matters concerning Religion to the Councell; the French Prelates, when they came, would propoſe both thoſe and many other things. The Legats anſwered they ſhould be welcome, and willingly heard; but that they ought not for that cauſe to deferre the Seſſion, in regard that nothing ſhould bee handled in it in preiudice of their propoſitions; that moſt of the Fathers were reſolued the Seſſion ſhould bee held; that it was dangerous to giue them diſtaſte, and that if they expected in <hi>Trent,</hi> with great diſcommoditie, thoſe who liued at their eaſe, and deferred their comming which they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it was not fit to diſcontent them more, by making them remaine idle. This cunning perſwaſion being not ſtrongly oppoſed by the Ambaſſadours, they held the Congregation, and framed the Decrees; which being eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, when they came to appoint the time and the matter for the next Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Granata</hi> counſelled them to prolong the time, that the French-men, and Polonians might haue ſpace, not onely to come, but to informe themſelues, and that they would not proceede to a preciſe declaration of that which was to be handled, but ſtand vpon the generall, as formerly they had done, and reſolue according to occurrences. For ſo many perſons beeing to come, it could not bee but that they would bring ſome new matters, which might cauſe new determinations. This opinion was followed by the Spaniards, and many others, and was like to haue beene generally approoued. But it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noyſed, that the Popes abſolute commandement was come, that the Seſſion ſhould not be deferred aboue two moneths, and that the Sacraments of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Marriage</hi> ſhould bee handled together, the Papalins were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to perſwade that the time might not bee prolonged, and that both thoſe Sacraments might be diſcuſſed. The Legates ſhewed they were forced
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:17208:296"/>
to make the Decree in conformitie heereof. But there were two other true cauſes of it; the one the quicke diſpatch of the Councell, becauſe they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, by ſo doing, to finiſh all in that Seſſion alone, the other, that the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and other fauourers of the reformation, might not haue time, beeing buſied in matters of faith, to handle any thing of importance; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that they might be hindered to promote, or inſiſt vpon Reſidence. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that this point was eſtabliſhed, all the Decrees beeing read together, new contradictions were raiſed, beſides the vſuall contentions, which the Legats could hardly ſtoppe with faire words. The Congregation laſted vntill two houres within night, with ſmall ſatisfaction of the parties, and ſcandall of honeſt men. In the end all was reſolued; but by the greater part only, which did not much exceed in number thoſe who contradicted.</p>
            <p>The ſeuenteenth of September, the day appointed for the Seſſion, beeing <note place="margin">The Seſſion.</note> come, the Legats Ambaſſadors, and 180. Prelats went to the Church, with the vſuall ceremonies; and after prayers made in time of the <hi>Maſse,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>entimiglia</hi> preached: who, with an Epiſcopall and Senatorious grauitie, vſing the compariſon betweene ciuill bodies and naturall, ſhewed how mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous a Synod would be, if it had no head; he ſhewed the office of it, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an influence of vertues into all the members, and the thankefulneſſe and duety of theſe, in hauing more care of it, then of themſelues, expoſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo to the defence of it, hee ſaid that the chiefe fault of an heretique, according to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> was, that hee doth not acknowledge an head, on which the connexion of the whole body doeth depend; hee added, in few words, that CHRIST was the inuiſible Head of the Church, but in many, that the Pope was the viſible. Hee commended the exact diligence of his Holineſſe, in making prouiſion for the Synod, and put euery one in minde of his duty in preſenting the dignity of his Head: hee praiſed the pietie and modeſtie of the Fathers; prayed GOD that that Councell might proceed, and end as gloriouſly as it had begun.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Maſse</hi> being ended, the letters of Cardinall <hi>Amulius</hi> were read, who, <note place="margin">The letters of Cardinall <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Orientall Chriſtians.</note> as Protector of the Orientall Chriſtian Nations, informed the Synod that <hi>Abdiſu,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Muzale,</hi> in <hi>Aſsyria,</hi> beyond <hi>Euphrates,</hi> was come to <hi>Rome,</hi> who had viſited the Churches, rendred obedience to the Pope, and receiued the confirmation and Cope from his Holineſſe. Hee related that the people ſubiect vnto him had receiued the faith, from the Apoſtles, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Thaddeus,</hi> and one of their Diſciples called <hi>Marcus,</hi> wholy conformable to the <hi>Roman,</hi> with the ſame Sacraments and Rites, whereof they had Bookes written euer ſince the time of the Apoſtles. In the end, hee told the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Countrey, ſubiect to that Prelat, which extendeth it ſelfe vnto, the further <hi>India,</hi> with innumerable people, ſubiect, partly to the <hi>Turke,</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the <hi>Sophi</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and to the King of <hi>Portugall.</hi> The letter beeing read, the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Portugall</hi> proteſted, that the Eaſterne Biſhops ſubiect to his King, did not acknowledge any Patriarch for their Superior, and ſaid that by acknowledging of this Patriarch, they might not doe themſelues and the King a preiudice.

                  </gap>.</note> 17 of March, was read, in which hee ſwore to maintaine the faith of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> promiſing to approoue and condemne that which it did
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:17208:296"/>
approue and condemne, and to teach the ſame to the <hi>Metropolitans</hi> and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſubiect vnto him. Afterwards his letters, directed to the Synode, were read, in which hee excuſed his not comming to the Councel, by reaſon of the length of the iourney, and prayed them, that when it was ended, the Decrees thereof might be ſent vnto him, which he promiſed he would cauſe to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerued. The ſame things had been read in the firſt Congregation, but not regarded. The Portugals proteſtation made men conſider diuers abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in that narration, and there was a whiſpering, and the Portugall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates began to ſpeake. But the Speaker, by order of the Legates, told them, that this ſhould be ſpoken of in the Congregation.</p>
            <p>And proceeding in the actes of the Councell, the Maſſe Biſhop read the <note place="margin">The doctrine of the <hi>Maſſè.</hi>
               </note> doctrine of the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> diuided into nine heads; which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſumme: 1. That, for the imperfection of the Leuitical Prieſthood, another Prieſt, according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> was neceſſary; which was CHRIST our LORD: who, although he offered himſelfe but once vpon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> to leaue in the Church a viſible Sacrifice, repreſenting that of the <hi>Croſse,</hi> and applying the vertue thereof, declaring himſelfe to be a Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> offered to GOD the Father his body and blood, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bread and Wine, and gaue them to his Apoſtles, commanding them and their ſucceſſors to offer them. And this is that pure offering foretolde by <hi>Malachie,</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Table of the LORD, and was figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by diuers Sacrifices, in the time of Nature, and of the Law. 2. Becauſe the ſame CHRIST is ſacrificed in the <hi>Maſſe</hi> without blood, who was ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the <hi>Croſſe</hi> with blood, this ſacrifice is propitiatory, and GOD, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with this offering, beſtoweth the gift of repentance, and remitteth all ſinnes, the offering, and (by the Prieſts) the offerer beeing the ſame, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly offered himſelfe vpon the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> onely in a diuers manner; ſo that this of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> doth not derogate from that of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> yea, by this, the fruits of that are receiued, which is offered for the ſinnes, puniſhments, and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the faithfull, and alſo for the dead, not fully purged. 3. And though ſome <hi>Maſſes</hi> bee celebrated in memory of the Saints, the ſacrifice is not offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, but to GOD onely. 4. And, to offer him with reuerence, the Church hath, for many ages, inſtituted the Canon, free from all errour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed out of the words of the LORD, tradition of the Apoſtles, and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Popes. 5. And, for the edification of the faithfull, the Church hath inſtituted certaine Rites to pronounce in the Maſſe, ſome things with a lowe, and ſome with a loud voice, adding benedictions, lights, odours, and veſtments by Apoſtolicall tradition. 6. And the Synode doeth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne as priuate and vnlawfull, but doeth approoue thoſe <hi>Maſſes,</hi> in which the Prieſt doeth communicate alone (which vſe is common) in regard the people doeth communicate ſpiritually, and that they are celebrated by a publique Miniſter, and for all the faithfull. 7. And the Church hath commanded to put water into the wine, becauſe CHRIST hath done ſo, and from his ſide did iſſue water and blood together, by which the vnion of the people, ſignified by the water, with CHRIST their head is repreſented. 8. And howſoeuer the people doe not receiue much inſtruction by the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> yet the Fathers haue not thought it fit that it ſhould bee celebrated in
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:17208:297"/>
the vulgar. Therefore retaining the vſe of the Romane Church, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may not bee deceiued, the Prieſts ought to expound ſomething which is read in it, eſpecially vpon Holy dayes. 9. And to condemne the errours which are ſpread againſt this doctrine, it doeth adde nine Canons.</p>
            <p>1. Anathematizing him that ſhall ſay, that a true and proper ſacrifice is not offered to GOD in the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> 2. Or that ſhall ſay that CHRIST, by theſe wordes, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of mee,</hi> hath not inſtituted Prieſts, and <note place="margin">The Canons of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi>
               </note> commanded them to offer. 3. Or ſhall ſay, that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> is a ſacrifice onely of prayſe, or thankeſgiuing, or a bare commemoration of the ſacrifice of the <hi>Croſſe,</hi> and not propitiatory, and that it doeth helpe onely him that doeth receiue it, and ought not to bee offered for the huing and the dead, for ſinnes, puniſhments, ſatisfactions, and other neceſſities. 4. Or ſhall ſay, that the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe</hi> doeth derogate from that of the <hi>Croſse.</hi> 5. Or that it is a deceit to celebrate <hi>Maſſes</hi> in honour of Saints. 6. Or that errors are contained in the Canon of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> 7. Or that the ceremonies, veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or externall ſignes vſed in the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> are rather incitements to vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, then offices of pietie. 8. Or that the <hi>Maſſes,</hi> in which the Prieſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone doeth communicate, are vnlawfull. 9. Or ſhall condemne the Rite of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſpeake part of the Canon and the words of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration with a low voyce; or that the <hi>Maſſe</hi> ought to be celebrated in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or that water ought not to bee mingled with the Wine.</p>
            <p>The Fathers aſſented to the Decree, except onely to that particular, that <note place="margin">A decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi>
               </note> CHRIST did offer himſelfe, which three and twenty Biſhops did contradict: and ſome others ſayd, that, howſoeuer they held it to be true, yet they thought not either the time or place fit to decree it. And there was ſome confuſion in deliuering their voyces, becauſe many ſpake at once. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Granata</hi> began to diſſent, who, hauing contradicted in the Congregations, that hee might not haue occaſion to doe the ſame in Seſſion, determined to be abſent. But the Legats ſeeing him not at <hi>Maſſe,</hi> ſent to call him more then once, and conſtrained him to come; which did more excite him to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. Immediatly after another Decree was read for inſtruction of Biſhops, concerning abuſes to be corrected in celebration of the <hi>Maſſes:</hi> And contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſubſtance; That the Biſhops ought to forbid all things brought in by auarice, irreuerence, or ſuperſtition. It named particularly, for faults of aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, bargaines for reward, that which is giuen for new <hi>Maſſes,</hi> importunate exaction of almes: of irreuerence, the admitting to ſay <hi>Maſſe</hi> of vagabond Prieſts, vnknowen, and publique and notorious ſinners, <hi>Maſſes</hi> in priuate houſes, &amp; euery where elſe out of the Churches and Oratories, if the aſſiſtants be not in an honeſt habit, the vſe of Muſicke in Churches, mixed with laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious ſongs, all ſecular actions, profane ſpeeches, noiſes, and ſcreeches; of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, to celebrate out of due houres, with other ceremonies and prayers then thoſe which are allowed by the Church, and receiued by vſe, a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate number of ſome <hi>Maſſes,</hi> and of candles. It ordained alſo, that the people ſhould bee admoniſhed to goe to their Pariſh Churches, at the leaſt on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes and great Holy-dayes, declaring that the things aforeſayd are propoſed to the Prelats, that they may prohibite and correct as Delegats of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique Sea, not onely thoſe, but all that are alike vnto them.</p>

Afterwards the Decree for the grant of the Cup was read; of this tenor. That the Synod hauing reſerued to it ſelfe the examination and definition of two Articles, concerning the communion of the Cup, in the former Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, hath now determined to deferre the whole buſineſſe to the Pope, who, in his ſingular wiſedome, may do what he thinketh profitable for the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Common wealth, and for the good of thoſe who demand it. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, as it was approoued in the Congregations by the maior part onely, ſo it <note place="margin">The Decree concerning the Cup.</note> happened in the Seſſion, where, beſide thoſe who contradicted, becauſe they thought the Cup could not bee granted for any cauſe; there were ſome who required that the matter ſhould be deferred, and examined againe. To whom the <hi>Speaker</hi> anſwered, in the name of the Legats, that conſideration ſhould be had of it.

Therefore the Legats knowing that hardly more then halfe would conſent to this of the Chalice, did reſolue to make it an Article of reformation, and to place it the laſt amongſt thoſe, to ſhew plainely that they held it to be of that ranke. There were alſo many diſcourſes at that time, and ſome dayes after, about the point decided, that CHRIST offered himſelfe in the <hi>Supper,</hi> ſome ſaying that, in regard of the three and twenty contradictors, it was not lawfully decided, and others anſwering that an eight part could not bee called a conſiderable, or notable part. There were ſome alſo who maintained that the <hi>maxime</hi> had place onely in the <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> and in the ſubſtance of the doctrine, and not in euery clauſe which is put in for better expreſſion, as this, which is not mentioned in the Canons.</p>
            <p>The Emperours Ambaſſadours were very glad for the Decree of the Cup, beeing aſſured that his Maieſtie would more eaſily obtaine it of the Pope, and vpon more fauourable conditions, then it could haue beene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Councell, where, for the variety of opinions and intereſts, it is hard to make many to bee of one minde, though in a good and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary matter. The greater part ouercommeth the better, and he that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth hath alwayes the aduantage of him that promoteth. And their hope was the greater, becauſe the Pope ſeemed before to haue fauoured their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But the Emperour had not the ſame opinion, aiming not to obtaine the communion of the Cup abſolutely, but to pacifie the people of his owne States, and of <hi>Germanie,</hi> who beeing diſtaſted with the Popes authoritie for the things paſt, could not reliſh any thing well that proceeded from him; whereas if they had obtained this grant immediatly from the Councell, it would haue giuen them good ſatisfaction, and bred an opinion in them, that
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:17208:298"/>
they might haue obtained other requeſts which they eſteemed; ſo that this motion beeing ſtopped, and the infected Miniſters caſſeered, he did hope he might haue held them in the Catholique Communion. Hee ſaw, by former experience, that the grant of <hi>Paul</hi> was not well receiued, and did more hurt then good; and, for this cauſe, hee did proſecute the inſtance no further with the Pope, and declared the cauſe of it. Therefore when hee receiued newes of the Decree of the Councell, turning to ſome Prelates who were with him, hee ſaid, I haue done all I can to ſaue my people, now looke you vnto it, whom it doeth more concerne.</p>
            <p>But thoſe people which deſired and expected the fauour, or, as they ſayd, <note place="margin">The cenſure of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> the reſtitution of that which was due vnto them, were all diſtaſted that their iuſt requeſt hauing been treated on ſixe moneths, preſented by the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſo many, and ſo great Princes, and after, for better examination; deferred and diſputed, and diſcuſſed againe with ſuch contention, ſhould, in the end be referred to the Pope, which might haue been as well done at the very firſt, without looſing ſo much time, ſo many perſwaſions, and ſo great paines. They ſayd, the condition of Chriſtians was according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of <hi>Iſayas, Hee ſendeth, and countermandeth, expecteth, and reexpecteth.</hi> For the Pope, who was moued firſt, referred that to the Councel, which now the Councell remitteth to him; and both of them doe mocke both Prince and people. Some diſcourſed more ſubſtantially; that the Synod had reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the definition of two Articles. Whether the cauſes which did formerly moue to take away the Cup, are ſuch as that they ought to make them perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere in the ſame prohibition; and if not, with what conditions it ought to be granted. The former being vndoubtedly a matter not of fact, but of faith, the Councell did confeſſe, by a neceſſary conſequence, that it knew the cauſes to bee vnſufficient; and would not, for worldly reſpects, make the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For if they had thought them ſufficient, they muſt needes perſeuere in the prohibition; if any doubt had remained they ſhould haue proceeded in the examination, and ought not to remit it, but for the inſufficiencie of the cauſes. But if they had made the declaration negatiue, that is, that the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were not ſuch as that they ought to perſeuere, and referred to the Pope to doe vpon information, what remained to be done <hi>defacto,</hi> they might haue beene excuſed. Neither can it bee ſayd that this is preſuppoſed by the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For in the Decree of this Seſſion, hauing repeated the two Articles, they reſolued to referre the whole buſineſſe to the Pope; and therefore not preſuppoſing any thing.</p>
            <p>I doe not finde, in the memorials which I haue ſeene, that the Decree of the ſacrifice did rayſe any matter of diſcourſe. And the cauſe perhaps was, for that the words doe not ſo eaſily declare the ſenſe, as contayning many ſtrained <hi>Metaphors,</hi> which draw the mindes of the Readers vnto diuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, who, when they are come to the end, know not what they haue read. Onely concerning the prohibition of the vulgar tongue in the Maſſe, the Proteſtants ſayd ſomething. For it ſeemed a contradiction, to ſay, that the Maſſe doeth containe much inſtruction for the faithfull people, and to, approoue that part ſhould be vttered with a lowe voice, and wholly to forbid the vulgar tongue, onely commanding the Paſtors to declare ſomething to
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:17208:299"/>
the people. Whereunto ſome anſwered well, that, in the Maſſe were ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets which ought to be concealed from the people, which are vncapable; for which cauſe they are ſpoken ſoftly, and in the Latine tongue, but other things which be of good edification are commanded to be taught. But this was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed two wayes; one, that therefore this ſecond ſort ought to bee in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; the other, becauſe they did not diſtinguiſh the two ſorts. For the Paſtors being commanded to declare, often, ſomething of that which is read, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale the reſt, theſe two kindes being not diſtinguiſhed, ſome of them may miſtake for want of knowledge, and ſo abuſe the people. The Antiquaries did laugh at theſe diſcourſes; becauſe it is certaine that euery tongue which is now brought into Arte, was formerly vulgar, in its owne Countrey; and that the Latin, vſed in the Church, was many hundred yeeres, both in <hi>Italie,</hi> and in diuers Colonies of the Romans, in diuers Prouinces, the common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And in the Romane Pontificall there remaineth yet a forme of the ordination of Readers in the Church, in which it is ſaid, that they muſt ſtudy to reade diſtinctly and plainely, that the people may vnderſtand. But he that would know what language is to be vſed in the Church, needeth only (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more diſcourſe) reade the 14. Chapter of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in the firſt to the Corinthians, which will ſufficiently informe him, though his minde be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much prepoſſeſſed with a contrary opinion. And hee that would know what the meaning of the Church was, and when and why the Court made this alteration, may obſerue, that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the eighth, hauing ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprehended the <hi>Morauians,</hi> for celebrating of the Maſſe in the <hi>Slauonian</hi> tongue, and commanded them to doe ſo no more, yet beeing better informed afterwards, wrote i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the yeere eight hundred eighty eight, to <hi>Sfento-Pulero,</hi> their King or Counte, a letter, in which, not by way of grant, but of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; he affirmeth that it is not contrary to faith and ſound doctrine to ſay Maſſe, and other prayers in the <hi>Slauonian</hi> tongue, becauſe he that hath made the Hebrew language, Grecke, and Latine, and hath made others alſo for his glory, alleadging diuers paſſages of the Scripture, and, in particular, the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Corinthians. Onely he commanded that, for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>decorum</hi> in the Church, the Goſpel ſhould firſt be read in Latine, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the <hi>Slauonian</hi> tongue, as the vſe already was in ſome places. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee gaue leaue to the Count, and his Iudges, to heare the Latin Maſſe if it pleaſed them better. To theſe things wee muſt adde that which <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeuenth wrote to <hi>Vratiſlaus,</hi> of <hi>Bobemia,</hi> iuſt two hundred yeeres after, that he could not permit the celebration of diuine Offices in the <hi>Slauoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> tongue, and that it was not a good excuſe, to alleadge, that it was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly prohibited. For the Primitiue Church hath diſſembled many things, which afterwards, Chriſtianitie beeing eſtabliſhed, vpon exact examination, haue been corrected. And he commanded that Prince to oppoſe the people herein with all his forces. Which things he that ſhall obſerue plainely, ſhall ſee which were the ancient incorrupt inſtitutions, and how corruptions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan for worldly reſpects and intereſts. For when men began to place hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen below the earth, good inſtitutions were publiſhed to be corruptions, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tolerated by antiquitie, and abuſes, brought in afterwards, were canonized for perfect corrections.</p>

<pb n="580" facs="tcp:17208:300"/>
no leſſe noted. For it is plaine, that, in ancient times, euery diſpenſation was adminiſtred by the Paſtors in their ſeuerall Churches, and that afterwards in ſucceſſe the Popes reſerued to themſelues the moſt principall things; which one might ſay was done, that the moſt important matters might not bee managed by vnſufficient perſons, howſoeuer the reaſon formerly alleadged to the contrary by the Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> ſeemeth very ſtrong. But now the Councell decreeing that diſpenſations ſhall bee committed to the <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> to whom they ſhould belong, if reſeruations did ceaſe, one may demaund to what end power is taken from any perſon, to bee giuen to the ſame againe? It is plaine that, by reſeruing diſpenſations, nothing was meant in <hi>Rome,</hi> but onely that their Bulls might bee vttered; becauſe this beeing done, they thinke it better the worke ſhould be executed by him that ſhould haue done it, if hee had not been forbid, then by any other. Diuers other oppoſitions were made, by thoſe who more willingly cenſure the actions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> others, when they proceede from eminent perſons; which becauſe they bee of no great moment, are not worthy of an hiſtory.</p>
            <p>The Pope beeing aduiſed of the holding of the Seſſion, and of that which happened in it, was very glad, as deliuered from the feare hee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, that, in the contention about the Cup, his authority would bee drawen into diſputation; and becauſe this way of compoſing differences, by referring them vnto him, was opened, hee hoped the like might bee done in the Article of reſidence, or in any other that ſhould be controuerſed: by which meanes the Councell would be ended quickly. But hee foreſaw two cauſes which might croſſe his deſſeigne; one, the comming of the Card. of <hi>Lorraine</hi> with the French Biſhops, which did much trouble him, eſpecially in regard of the vaſt thoughts of that Prelat, much contrary to the affaires of the <note place="margin">The Pope plotteth to make a <hi>maior</hi> part in the Councell.</note> Papacie, ſo incorporated in him, that he was not able to conceale them; for which hee ſaw no remedie, but by making the Italians ſo farre exceede the <hi>Vltramontans,</hi> that in their voyces they ſhould not paſſe for a conſiderable number. Therefore he continually ſollicited all the Biſhops, whether titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or others who had renounced, to goe to <hi>Trent,</hi> offering to beare their charges, and loading them with promiſes. Hee thought alſo to ſend a number of Abbats, as had beene done in ſome Councels. But beeing adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed better, he thought it fit not to ſhew ſo much affection, nor to prouoke others to doe the like. Hee feared another croſſe in regard of the purpoſes which he had diſcouered in all Princes to hold the Councell open with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of nothing; in the Emperour, to gratifie the Dutchmen, and to gaine their fauour in the election of his ſonne to be King of the Romans; in the French King, to worke his will with the ſame men, and with the Hugonots. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered much of the Congregation of the Ambaſſadours, which ſeemed to be a Councell of Seculars in the middeſt of that of the Biſhops; thinking that the Congregations of the Prelates would bee dangerous, without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and preſidence of the Legates to keepe them in order, and therefore, that the Ambaſſadours much more, might handle things preiudiciall, and that there was danger if they continued, that they might bring in ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, in regard there were Eccleſiaſtiques amongſt them, and ſo vſe licence, vnder the name of liberty. In this perplexity hee conceiued hope, becauſe he
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:17208:300"/>
ſaw the greater part of the Ambaſſadours oppoſe the propoſitions, and that none were combined but onely the Ambaſſadours of the Emperour, and of the French King, who hauing no Prelats could preuaile but little. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he thought fit to ſollicite the concluſion of the Councell, and to cheriſh the diuiſion which hee ſaw amongſt the Ambaſſadours. Therefore he wrot immediatly that they ſhould hold Congregations often, and digeſt, and put in order the matters quickly. And becauſe to giue one thankes, doth oblige him to perſeuere, he commanded that the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Portugall,</hi> &amp; of the Suiſſes, and the Secretary of the Marquiſſe of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and heartily thanked, on his part, for refuſing to conſent with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to an impertinent propoſition. Hee cauſed thankes to be giuen to the Venetians, and Florentine, for the good intention they ſhewed in denying to come to the Congregation, praying them not to refuſe to come hereafter if they were called, becauſe he knew their preſence would euer be ſeruiceable to the Apoſtolique Sea, and hinder the bad deſſeignes of others. Neither was his Holineſſe deceiued in his opinion. For it made them all ſay, that they had done ſo, becauſe in thoſe times, the ſeruice of God did require that the Popes authoritie ſhould bee defended, reſoluing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere in that reſolution. And they profeſſed they were more obliged by the courteous thankes of his Holineſſe for doing that, to which their duety did bind them.</p>

Therefore I thought firſt that the forme of a Diarie would beſt agree to this ſubiect. But two oppoſitions did croſſe mine opinion: One, that that forme could not befit the occurrences of twenty nine yeeres, ſpent in making preparation for the birth of this Councell, nor of the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres which paſſed while it ſlept, it not beeing knowen whether it were aliue or dead. Another, that all the matter which a continuate Diarie doth require, could not poſſibly be found. Therefore, fitting the forme to the matter, as nature doth, not the matter to the forme, as the Schooles, I thought it not abſurd to write the preparatory and interconciliary times by way of <hi>Annals,</hi> and in thoſe of the celebration to make a Diarie of the occurrences of thoſe dayes, the knowledge whereof I was able to attaine; hoping that whoſoeuer ſhall reade this Treatiſe, will excuſe the omiſſion of thoſe which could not be knowen. For if of things, the intire memorie of which thoſe who haue intereſt doe labour by all meanes to preſerue, often times a great part is quickly loſt, how much more will it happen in this, which many
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:17208:302"/>
men of great place, and exact iudgement, haue vſed all diligence, amd ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no paines wholly to conceale. It is true that matters of great weight ought to bee held in a myſtery, when it is for the common good; but when it doeth damnifie one, and profit another, it is no maruaile if men who haue contrary ends, doe proceed in contrary courſes. The common and famous ſaying of the Lawyers is true, that his cauſe is more to be fauoured who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to auoyd loſſe, then as who ſeeketh gaine. For theſe cauſes this Treatiſe of mine is ſubiect to ſome diſequalitie of Narration; and howbeit I might ſay, that as much might bee found in ſome famous Writer, yet this ſhall not bee my defence; but this, that if others haue auoyded it, they haue not written the Hiſtory of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> nor any other like vnto it.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadours of <hi>France,</hi> ſo ſoone as the Seſſion was ended, receiued <note place="margin">The petition, of the French Ambaſſadors.</note> letters from their King, that they ſhould make inſtance for the deferring of it. Wherefore though the time was paſt, they came to the Legates, and told them they had a new commiſſion from the King to make requeſt, that they would labour in the reformation, and, for points of doctrine, expect the comming of his Prelates; adding that, if the matter of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Matrimonie</hi> were diſputed by the Diuines, and handled by the Prelates, no more points of doctrine would remaine, and the comming of the Frenchmen would bee to no purpoſe. Wherefore then requeſt was, that they would be pleaſed to deferre them vntill the end of October, imploying themſelues, in the meane ſpace, in the matter of reformation, or one day in that, and another, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of doctrine, not deferring as they had done, all the matter of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vntill the laſt dayes immediatly before the Seſſion, ſo that there ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained time ſo much as to ſee the Articles, much leſſe to conſult vpon them. The Legates anſwered that their propoſitions did deſire to be weighed well, <note place="margin">To which the Legates an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> and that they would be carefull to giue them all poſſible ſatisfaction; deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a copie of their inſtructions, that they might reſolue the better. The Ambaſſadours gaue them a writing, of this tenour: That the King hauing ſeene the Decrees of the ſixteenth of Iuly, concerning the Communion <hi>Sub v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traque,</hi> and deferring two Articles in the ſame matter, and thoſe propoſed in the Congregations concerning the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, howſoeuer hee commendeth that which is done, yet he cannot conceale that which is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpoken, that is, that the matter of diſcipline and manners is either quite omitted, or ſlenderly handled, and the controuerſed points in Religion, in which all the Fathers doe agree, haſtily determined. Which although hee thinketh to bee falſe, yet hee deſireth that the propoſitions of his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours may bee expounded, as neceſſary, to prouide for the good of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the calamities of his Kingdome. And hauing found, by exper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that neither ſeuerity nor moderation hath beene able to reduce thoſe who are ſeparated from the Church, hee thought fit to haue recourſe to the Generall Councell which hee hath obtained of the Pope; that hee was ſory that the tumults of <hi>France</hi> did hinder the comming of his Prelates; that hee ſaw well that the conſtancie and rigour, in continuing the forme begunne by the Legats and Biſhops, was not fit to reconcile peace, and make an vnity in the Church; that his deſire was, that nothing might bee done to aliene the
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:17208:302"/>
mindes of the aduerſaries, now in the beginning of the Councell, but that they may bee inuited, and, in caſe they come, receiued as children with all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie, hoping that by this meanes, they will ſuffer themſelues to be taught, and brought backe to the boſome of the Church. And becauſe all that are in <hi>Trent</hi> doe profeſſe the ſame Religion, and neither can nor will make doubt of any part thereof, hee thinketh the diſputation and cenſure in poynts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to bee not onely ſuperfluous, but impertinent for the Catholiques, and a cauſe to ſeparate the aduerſaries the more. For hee that thinketh they will receiue the Decrees of the Councell in which they haue not aſſiſted, doeth not know them well; neither will any thing bee done by this meanes, but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments miniſtred of writing more Bookes. Therefore the King thinketh it better to omit the matter of Religion, vntill the other of Reformation bee well ſet in order: and that this is the ſcope at which euery one muſt ayme, that the Councell, which now is great, and will bee greater by the comming of the Frenchmen; may produce fruit. Afterwards the King demandeth, that in regard of the abſence of his Biſhops, the next Seſſion may bee put off vntill the end of October, or the publication of the Decrees deferred, or a new order expected from the Pope, to whom hee hath written, labouring in the meane while in the matter of Reformation. And becauſe he vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that the ancient libertie of Councels is not obſerued, that Kings and Princes, or their Ambaſſadours may declare the neceſſities of their States, his Maieſtie demandeth that their authoritie may bee preſerued, and all reuoked which hath been done to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the Emperours Ambaſſadours came to the Legats, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">The petition of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors.</note> that the Articles ſent by his Maieſtie, and preſented by them, might bee propoſed, and were very earneſt that the points of doctrine might bee defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vntill the comming of the Frenchmen; and, that the reformation may bee ſeruiceable not onely for the whole Church, but for the Church of euery particular Kingdome, their deſire was that two of euery Nation might bee deputed, to put them in minde of that which did deſerue to bee propoſed, and diſcuſſed in Councell. The Legats made a common anſwere to them both, that they could not alter, without great preiudice, the order ſet downe, which was to handle Doctrine and Reformation both together, and, if they ſhould, that other Princes would oppoſe; but, to content them, they would ordaine that the Diuines and Prelates ſhould examine the matter of Order onely, and afterwards handle ſome poynts of Reformation, obſeruing ſtill the former vſe, that euery one, of what condition ſoeuer, may put them, the Legats, in minde, of what they thinke neceſſary, profitable, or conuenient; which is a greater liberty then to haue two deputed for euery nation: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they would treat of <hi>Matrimonie.</hi> The Ambaſſadours being not one iote contented, the Legats ſent all their demands to the Pope.</p>
            <p>The Frenchmen complained to all men of this auſteritie, and for that the Pope had lately commanded other Prelats to goe to the Councell, that hee might exceed in number: which the Papalins themſelues did not like ſhould bee done ſo openly, and iuſt when the newes was ſpread of the comming of the French-men; deſiring to be ſecured by a <hi>maior</hi> part, yet ſo, as not to haue it knowne for what cauſe it was done.

The difference concerning inferiour <hi>Orders</hi> in the old Pontificals, where that which is in one is not in another, doeth ſhew they are Sacramentall, and not Sacraments. And reaſon doth lead vs hereunto. For the actions which one ordained doth, may be done by one not ordained, and are of the ſame vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, effect, and perfection. Saint <hi>Bonauenture</hi> alſo, though hee thinketh that all ſeuen are Sacraments, yet he holdeth two other opinions to be probable; one, that onely <hi>Prieſthood</hi> is a Sacrament, and the inferiours, being imployed about corporall things, as to open doores, reade Leſſons, light Tapers, and the like, doe not ſeeme to expreſſe any celeſtiall matter, and are therefore one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſitions to <hi>Prieſthood.</hi> The ſecond, that the three holy <hi>Orders</hi> are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and, concerning the common ſaying, that the inferiour are degrees to the ſuperiour, Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> affirmeth, that in the Primitiue Church many were ordained Prieſts immediatly, without paſſing by the inferiour <hi>Orders,</hi> and that the Church did ordaine that this paſſage ſhould be made for humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation onely. It appeareth plainely, in the Actes of the Apoſtles, that Saint <hi>Matthias</hi> was immediatly ordayned an Apoſtle, and the ſeuen Deacons did not paſſe by the <hi>Subdeaconſhip,</hi> and the inferiour <hi>Orders. Paulinus</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, that, hauing a purpoſe to apply himſelfe to the ſeruice of GOD in the Clergie, he would, for humiliation, paſſe by all Eccleſiaſticall degrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the <hi>Ostiarie;</hi> but while hee was thinking to begin, beeing yet a Laicke, the multitude tooke him by force in <hi>Barcelona</hi> on Chriſtmas day, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him before the Biſhop, and cauſed him to be ordained <hi>Prieſt</hi> at the firſt; which would not haue beene done if it had not beene the vſe in thoſe times. Therefore this <hi>Brauus</hi> concluded, that the Synod ought not to paſſe beyond thoſe things which are agreed on by the Catholiques, and that it was better
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:17208:304"/>
to begin with the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Priesthood,</hi> which would make a connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene this Seſſion and the laſt, which handled the Sacrifices, and to paſſe from <hi>Prieſthood</hi> to <hi>Order</hi> in generall, not deſcending to any particularitie.</p>
            <p>The Congregation being ended, and moſt of the Prelates departed, <hi>Fiue Churches,</hi> with his Hungarians, and ſome Polonians, and Spaniards, taried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde; to whom he made a ſpeach, and ſayd, that the Emperour, being freed from all ſuſpicion of warre; by the truce concluded with the Turke, tooke <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> maketh a ſpeech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> nothing ſo much to the heart as the reformation of the Church; which would ſurely be effected, if ſome of the Prelates in the Councell would aſſiſt. Therefore he exhorted and prayed them, for Gods ſake, and for the charitie which euery Chriſtian oweth to the Church, that they would not abandon ſo honeſt, iuſt, and profitable a cauſe, that euery one would put downe in writing what hee thought might be conſtituted for the ſeruice of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect of man, not reforming one part, but the whole body of the Church, both in the head and in the members. <hi>Granata</hi> did ſecond him, ſhewing the neceſſity and opportunity thereof, thanking the Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> for his admonition, and ſaid, they would conſult amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. For this cauſe the Spaniards, being aſſembled together, diſcourſed of <note place="margin">And is ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Spaniards.</note> the neceſſitie of reformation, and the hope thereof, in regard of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours inclination, from which their King alſo, who was moſt piouſly addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted would not diſſeut, and the French Prelates, who would ſhortly be there, would vndoubtedly promote and aſſiſt the worke, in earneſt. They repeated diuers abuſes, and ſhewed that the fountaine of them all was the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is not onely corrupt in it ſelfe, but the cauſe of deformation in all Churches; and particularly the vſurpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ion of the Epiſcopall authoritie, by reſeruations, which if it were not reſtored, and the Court depriued of that which they haue taken from Biſhops, it would bee impoſſible the abuſes ſhould bee redreſſed. <hi>Granata</hi> conſidered, that, it beeing neceſſary to lay a good foundation for ſo noble a Fabrique, a way was open for them now that they were to ſpeake of the Sacrament of <hi>Order,</hi> if it bee determined that the authority of Biſhops is inſtituted by CHRIST; becauſe it will follow by conſequence, that it cannot bee diminiſhed; by which meanes that will bee reſtored to the Biſhops, which hauing been giuen them by CHRIST, hath by the ambition of others, and their owne negligence, been vſurped from them. <hi>Braganza</hi> added, that it was ſo much the more neceſſary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Epiſcopall authority was brought to nothing, and the <hi>Order</hi> ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſuperiour to Biſhops, vnknowen to the Church in former ages, that is, the Cardinals, who at the firſt, were eſteemed in the number of Prieſts, and Deacons, and, after the tenth age began to exalt themſelues aboue their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Notwithſtanding they were ſtill accounted inferiour to Biſhops vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the yeere 1200 ſince which time they haue ſo farre aduanced themſelues, that they hold Biſhops as ſeruants in their houſes, and it will bee impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to reforme the Church, vntill both of them bee reduced to their due places.</p>
            <p>Theſe propoſitions and diſcourſes were heard with applauſe; ſo that they reſolued to elect ſixe of them, to put in writing the things neceſſary and fit, as well for the reformation in generall, as particularly for this point of the
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:17208:304"/>
inſtitution of Biſhops, whence they purpoſed to begin, <hi>Oranata, Iaſper Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nante,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Meſsina,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Segouia,</hi> and <hi>Martin di Cardoua,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tortoſa</hi> were named, the laſt of which was cauſe why the proiect did not proceed. For, hauing ſecret intelligence with the Papalins, he excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe, alleadging his owne inſufficiencie; and the vnfitneſſe of the time, adding that <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> was not mooued with pietie, and had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end then to make vſe of them, to conſtraine the Pope, by meanes of the reformation, to grant the vſe of the Cup, wherein they had beene auerſe. And ſeeing they were diſpoſed to heare him, hee preuailed ſo much with them that they paſſed no further for the preſent, but interpoſed a delay. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it was not long deferred. For <hi>Granata, Braganza, Meſsina,</hi> and <hi>Segouia,</hi> hauing obtained audience of the Legates, deſired that they might handle the Articles propoſed heretofore by Cardinall <hi>Creſcentius</hi> in this ſame Councell, and concluded, though not publiſhed, that is, that the Biſhops are inſtituted by CHRIST, and are ſuperiour to <hi>Priestes iure diuino.</hi> The Legates, after they had conferred together, anſwered, that the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> hauing affirmed that a Biſhop and a Prieſt is the ſamething, it was fit to declare that a Biſhop is ſuperiour, but that it was not neceſſary to ſay <hi>quo iure,</hi> nor by whom a Biſhop is inſtituted, becauſe there is no controuerſie of it. <hi>Granata</hi> replyed that there was a controuerſie, and that if the Diuines did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it, the neceſſity of deciding this point would be knowne. The Legates would not conſent by any meanes; and, after ſome few ſharpe words on both ſides, the Spaniards departed without hauing obtained any thing; yet reſolued ſtill to perſwade ſome of the Diuines to bring this particular into <note place="margin">The Legates wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the Papalins, vnderſtanding hereof, did cauſe it to be voyced amongſt the Diuines, that the Legates did forbid all ſpeach of that queſtion.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the congregation, when the ſecond ranke ſpake, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of Diuines and Canoniſts, <hi>Thomas Paſsius,</hi> a Canon of <hi>Valentia,</hi> ſaid, that all doubt made of the Eccleſiaſticall <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> did proceede from groſſe ignorance of antiquity, it being a thing moſt knowne that in the Church the people hath alwayes beene gouerned by the Clergie, and, in the Clergie, the inferiours by the ſuperiours, vntill all be reduced vnto one vniuerſall <hi>Rector,</hi> which is the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> And hauing declared the propoſition at large, he added that there was no need to doe any thing herein, but to make this trueth appeare, by remoouing the contrary errours, which haue bin brought in by the Schoolemen, who ſometimes, by too much ſubtiltie, doe make plaine things obſcure, oppoſing the Canoniſts, who place the firſt <hi>tonſure,</hi> and the Biſhopricke in the number of <hi>Orders.</hi> Of the latter he ſaid, it ſeemed ſtrange to him, how they could confeſſe, that confirmation, ordination, and ſo many other conſecrations doe ſo peculiarly belong vnto it, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly bee done by any elſe, and yet deny it to bee an <hi>Order,</hi> when as they giue that name to the keeping of the doore, which may as well be done by a Lay-man. For the firſt <hi>tonſure,</hi> he hath euer heard the Diuines ſay, that a Sacrament is an externall ſigne which ſignifieth a ſpirituall grace, and that the <hi>tonſure</hi> is the ſigne, and the thing ſignified is the deputation to the ſeruice
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:17208:305"/>
of God; and therefore hee wondered why they would not haue it to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the rather, becauſe one entreth into the Clergie by it, and doth participate of Eccleſiaſticall exemptions; ſo that, if it were not inſtituted by CHRIST, it could not be ſaid, that either Clergiſhip, or the exemption thereof were <hi>de iure Diuino;</hi> that it was plaine that the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> conſiſteth in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall <hi>Orders,</hi> which is nothing but an holy order of ſuperiors and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, which can neuer bee well eſtabliſhed without making, as the Canoniſts <note place="margin">Of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie.</hi>
               </note> doe, the <hi>Tonſure</hi> the loweſt, and the <hi>Biſhopricke</hi> the higheſt; which being done the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> is all eſtabliſhed, becauſe the firſt and laſt being giuen, thoſe of the middle will neceſſarily follow, which cannot ſubſiſt without the former.</p>
            <p>Concerning the other part of the Article, they ſaid, it was very plaine by the Canons, that in the choyce of Biſhops and deputation of Prieſts, and Deacons, the people of al ſorts was preſent, &amp; gaue voice or approbation, but this was by the Popes tacit or expreſſe conſent; becauſe no Laicke can haue authority in matters Eccleſiaſticall, but by priuiledge from him. And this was granted in thoſe times, becauſe the common people, and Grandies alſo, were deuout, and did, by this meanes, entertaine themſelues in ſpiritual things, and ſhewed more obedience and reuerence to the Clergie, beeing more ready to inrich it with oblations and donations, which hath made the holy Church to be in that ſtate in which it now is. But ſince deuotion did ceaſe, the ſeculars haue armed only at the vſurpation of the Church goods, &amp; to place their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents in the Clergie. And now the new Heretikes haue made a deuiliſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaying, that was due to the people which was granted by fauor which is one of the moſt peſtiferous hereſies which hath euer bin ſet on foot, becauſe it doth deſtroy the Church, without which faith cannot ſtand. He alleadged many reaſons and congruities, to ſhew that the ordination ought to be in the power only of the Ordainer, which he confirmed by the Popes <hi>Decretals</hi> and concluded in the end, that not only the Article was to be condemned as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, but that, the voice and conſent of the people in ordinations being taken away, for iuſt and neceſſary reaſons, the Pontifical alſo ought to be corrected, and thoſe places remoued which make mention thereof; becauſe, ſo long as they continue there, the heretikes wil make vſe of them, to proue that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the people is neceſſary. He ſaid the places were many; but to recite one, in the ordination of Prieſts, the Biſhop ordaining ſaith, that it hath been conſtituted by the Fathers, not without cauſe, that the people ſhould haue voice in the ordination of the Rectors of the altar, that they may be obedient to him whom they haue ordained, in regard of their conſenting to his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. If this, and other Rites ſhall remaine, the heretikes will alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the Catholike Church, ſaying the ordinations now are but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and ſhewes, as <hi>Luther</hi> did wickedly ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis Forrier,</hi> a Dominican of <hi>Portugal,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, could not be doubted of, it being proued by the Apoſtolicall tradition, by teſtimony of all antiquity, and by the continuall vſe of the Church. And howſoeuer the word bee not vſed by all, yet the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified hath euer been in practiſe. <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita</hi> hath made a proper treatiſe of it, and the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell hath approoued it, and called it an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtome: and that which hath been called ancient in the beginning of
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:17208:305"/>
the fourth age, muſt needes haue its originall from the time of the Apoſtles. Onely he thought it not fit to handle this poynt ioyntly with the Sacrament of <hi>Order,</hi> howſoeuer many of the Schoole-men doe handle it in that place, putting the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> in the ſuperiour and inferiour <hi>Orders;</hi> a thing which cannot ſubſiſt, it being certaine that the Pope is the higheſt Hierarch, and that the Cardinals do follow, &amp; then the Patriarchs, Primats, Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Arch-Prieſts, Arch-Deacons, and other inferiour degrees vnder the Pope, as Head. And to omit the diſputation whether the Biſhopricke be an <hi>Order,</hi> it is certaine that the Arch-biſhoprike, Patriarkſhip, and Papacie are not <hi>Orders,</hi> and doe ſignifie only ſuperiority and iuriſdiction ouer Biſhops. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> conſiſteth in iuriſdiction, and the Councel of <hi>Nice</hi> placeth it in that, when it ſpeaketh of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Antioch.</hi> Therefore the handling of <hi>Hierarchie</hi> muſt not be ioyned with that of <hi>Order,</hi> for feare of giuing way to calumnie.</p>
            <p>There was much varietie in the diſcuſſion of theſe Articles, thoſe of the ſecond ranke returning to the former, and ſome diſputing that the degree of a Biſhop was an <hi>Order,</hi> and others, that aboue Prieſthood, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Iuriſdiction, ſome alleadging Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and ſome Saint <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauenture,</hi> and ſome beeing of a middle opinion, that is, that it is an eminent dignitie, or office in the <hi>Order.</hi> The famous ſaying of Saint <hi>Hierom,</hi> and the authority of Saint <hi>Austin</hi> were alleadged, who ſay that the degree of a Biſhop hath beene moſt ancient, but yet an Eccleſiaſticall Conſtitution. <hi>Michael</hi> of <hi>Medina</hi> did oppoſe, and ſay, that the Catholique Church, as Saint <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſaith, did condemne <hi>Aerius</hi> of hereſie, for ſaying that the Degree of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop is no greater then that of a <hi>Priest:</hi> into which hereſie it is no wonder if <hi>Hierom, Austin,</hi> and ſome other of the Fathers did fall, becauſe the matter was not cleere in all poynts. This boldneſſe, to ſay that <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Austin</hi> did ſauour of hereſie, gaue great ſcandall; but hee inſiſted the more vpon it, and maintained his poſition. And the Doctors were equally diuided into two opinions in this poynt.</p>
            <p>Others placed this <hi>Hierarchie</hi> in <hi>Orders</hi> onely, alleadging <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> who in naming the Hierarchs, maketh mention of none but of Deacons, Prieſts, and Biſhops. Some followed <hi>Forrier,</hi> that it did conſiſt in <hi>Iuriſdiction.</hi> At the laſt a third opinion came foorth, that it was a mixture of both, which afterwards was more generally approoued. For placing it in <hi>Order,</hi> it did not appeare how Arch-biſhops, Patriarches, and, which is of more importance, the Pope himſelfe could enter, all beeing of accord that theſe Degrees are not <hi>Orders</hi> aboue the Degree of a Biſhop. Yet ſome did alleadge the common ſaying to the contrary, that the Epiſcopall <hi>Order</hi> is diuided into foure parts, Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Patriarches, and the Pope: and placing it in Iuriſdiction, none of the holy <hi>Orders</hi> did enter.</p>
            <p>There was a great diſputation amongſt them about the forme of the <note place="margin">The forme of the <hi>Hierarchy</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Hierarchie;</hi> ſome ſaying it was Charitie, ſome Faith informed, and others, according to Cardinall <hi>Turrecremata,</hi> Vnitie. To this laſt was oppoſed that vnitie is a genericall qualitie in all that is one, and is an effect of the forme which doth produce it. Thoſe who were for charitie brought very many places of the Fathers, which doe attribute the vnitie of the Church vnto it.
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:17208:306"/>
But others ſaid that it was the hereſie of <hi>Wigleſ.</hi> For, if it were ſo, a Prelate, looſing charity, would bee out of the <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> and loſe authoritie. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they did not auoyd the difficultie, by making faith informed to bee the forme, becauſe a Prelate might externally counterfeit, and bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly vnfaithfull, who not being of the <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> the Chriſtian people could not know whom to obey, becauſe they might doubt of all, and ſometimes had cauſe to doe it. And as the Diuines, eſpecially the Friars are free in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifications, they alleadged the Pope, ſaying, that, in caſe he ſhould bee incredulous, the whole <hi>Hierarchie</hi> would periſh by his default, whether one did make faith or charitie to bee the forme. And therefore they ſayd, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was. But the ſame difficulties did ariſe in regard of the vncertaintie thereof, becauſe the intention of the Miniſter, according to the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Councell, is eſſentially required, which is more ſecret then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two: for which cauſe it cannot bee certainly affirmed of any that hee is baptized.</p>
            <p>The Articles, whether there bee a viſible Prieſthood? or whether all Chriſtians bee Prieſts? or whether a Prieſt may become a Layman? or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his office bee preaching? were not handled with any diſcuſſion, but with declamations againſt the Lutherans, who depriue the Ghurch of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with GOD, and of the meanes to appeaſe him, making it a confuſion without gouernement, and bereauing her of all her beauty and comelineſſe. Friar <hi>Adamantius,</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> a Diuine of this ranke, belonging to Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Madruccio,</hi> ſaid, that the greateſt part of thoſe who had ſpoken, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged onely probable reaſons, and conueniencies, which when Articles of faith are diſcuſſed, doe not onely not force the aduerſaries, but confirme them more in their opinions; and, for proofe hereof hee brought a direct place of Saint <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Hee added that diſcuſſions in Councell ſhould differ from diſputations in Schooles. For in thoſe how much the more things are minced, and curiouſly handled, the better it is; but it doth not become a Councell to examine any thing, but that which may bee cleered and made plaine. Notwithſtanding many queſtions were diſputed, the knowledge whereof cannot in this life (in which GOD doth not ſuffer all to bee diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered) poſſibly bee attained. For this Article, it is abundantly ſufficient that the Church hath an <hi>Hierarchie;</hi> that the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> conſiſteth of Prelates and Miniſters, that theſe are ordained by Biſhops, that <hi>Order</hi> is a Sacrament, and that Seculars haue no part herein. <hi>Petrus Romirius,</hi> a Franciſcane Friar, following the doctrine of <hi>Iohn Scot,</hi> ſaid, that <hi>Order</hi> ought not to bee called a Sacrament, becauſe it is inuiſible and permanent, whereas all the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are neceſſarily viſible, and (except the <hi>Euchariſt)</hi> conſiſt in action. Therefore to auoyde all difficulties, one muſt not ſay that <hi>Order,</hi> but that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is a Sacrament. But hee was much oppoſed, becauſe all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, and (which is of no leſſe importance) the Councell of <hi>Florence</hi> alſo doe call <hi>Order</hi> a Sacrament. And it would bee a great boldneſſe to taxe all the Doctours, a generall Councell, and the whole Church for ſpeaking impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly.</p>
            <p>In the third ranke, there was no leſſe varietie of opinions concerning the <note place="margin">Of the holy Ghoſt giuen in Ordination</note> fift Article. For howſoeuer all agreed that the holy Ghoſt is giuen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:17208:306"/>
in Ordination, yet ſome ſaid, hee was giuen in his proper perſon, and others, in the gift of grace onely. They diſputed much on both ſides, but thoſe eſpecially who affirmed grace. Another queſtion was, whether grace of Iuſtification bee conferred, or onely a gift to exerciſe the office. For the former was alleadged, that all the Sacraments giue grace of Iuſtification; for the later, that a man cannot without repentance receiue grace, and yet may receiue <hi>Order.</hi> For the <hi>Character,</hi> as they all agreed that it is imprinted in <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Priesthood,</hi> ſo they diſſented in all the reſt. For ſome ſaid it was imprinted in the holy <hi>Orders</hi> onely, and others in all the ſeuen; both which opinions Saint <hi>Bonauenture</hi> doeth thinke to bee probable. Some were better pleaſed with the diſtinction of <hi>Durandus,</hi> that vnderſtanding, by <hi>Character,</hi> a power to worke a Spirituall effect, the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> onely hath it, which onely can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate, and remit ſinnes; and the others haue it not, in regard their actions are corporall, which a Lay-man, without any the leaſt veniall ſinne, may doe as well as they. But if by <hi>Character</hi> be vnderſtood a deputation to a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall office, ſo all the <hi>Orders</hi> haue a proper <hi>Character.</hi> Others oppoſed that it was a Lutherane opinion, contained in the firſt Article, and ſaid, that therefore it was neceſſary to affirme a proper and indeleble <hi>Character</hi> in all. And ſome ſaid it was in the firſt <hi>Tonſure</hi> alſo, becauſe it was not reiterated in thoſe who are degraded, as would be neceſſary if a <hi>Character</hi> were not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed; and becauſe, by it, one is inueſted in the Clergie, and made partaker of Ecleſiaſtical exemptions, and immunities. Neither would it bee poſſible to maintaine that Clerkeſhip, and the immunities thereof were <hi>de iure Diuino,</hi> but by ſaying, that the firſt <hi>Tonſure</hi> is a Diuine inſtitution. Concerning the degree of Biſhops the controuerſie was greater, and the queſtion was reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued whether it bee one of the <hi>Orders.</hi> For hauing two properactions ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, to confirme, and ordaine, a Spirituall power is neceſſary to it, which is a <hi>Character,</hi> without which ordination and confirmation would bee to no purpoſe. The auditors were weary with hearing ſo many difficulties, and did willingly giue eare to thoſe who ſaid they ought to omit them, and ſpeake onely in generall termes. But the Friars grumbled, and were angrie to ſee in them a diſpoſition to define Articles, and pronounce <hi>Anathemaes,</hi> not vnderſtanding the poynts, and abhorring thoſe who would informe them.</p>
            <p>In the ſixt Article they all condemned the Lutherans, for detracting from vnctions, and ceremonies vſed in conferring <hi>Orders.</hi> Some deſired that thoſe which are neceſſarie, and belong to the ſubſtance of the Sacrament (as was done in the Councell of <hi>Florence)</hi> might bee diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, and him declared to bee an heretique, who ſhould ſay that <hi>Order</hi> might bee giuen or receiued without them; and for the others, that hee ſhould bee condemned in generall termes, who did call them pernicious.

the ninth ſaith, it was a rite brought in, and many Diuines doe not hold it to be neceſſary, howſoeuer others be of the contrarie opinion. It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth alſo by the Decretall of <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third in this point, that vnction was not vſed in all Churches. And the famous Canoniſts, <hi>Hoſtienſis, Iohannes Andreas, Abbas,</hi> and others doe affirme, that the Pope may ordaine a Prieſt with theſe words onely, Be thou a Prieſt, and (which is of more importance) <hi>Innocentius,</hi> Father of all the Canoniſts, ſayth; that if the formes had not been inuented, it had beene ſufficient if the Ordainer had vſed theſe words onely, Be thou a Prieſt, or others equiualent, becauſe they were inſtituted by the Church afterwards to be obſerued.

            <p>Although the Congregations of the Diuines did take vp almoſt all the time, yet the Prelates did more intend, and diſcourſe amongſt themſelues of reformation, ſome promoting, and ſome declining it, then of the points of doctrine diſcuſſed by the Theologues; ſo that the frequent and publique ſpeeches which were heard throughout all <hi>Trent,</hi> cheriſhed by the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of the Emperour, and French King, induced the Legates to thinke it neceſſary to make ſhew they were not auerſe from it; eſpecially becauſe they had promiſed to propoſe it ſo ſoone as the matter of <hi>Order</hi> was diſcuſſed, and vnderſtood, that a diſcourſe of the Ambaſſadour <hi>Lanſac</hi> was receiued with <note place="margin">The Legates are much tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the ſpeeches that paſted concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> great applauſe made in an aſſembly of many Ambaſſadours and Prelates, in which hee concluded that if the reformation, propoſed and demanded by the Emperour, was ſo feared and abhorred, yet, at the leaſt, a way ought to bee found out without making new conſtitutions, to cauſe thoſe things which haue beene eſtabliſhed in ancient Councels to bee obſerued, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing the impediments which doe nouriſh the abuſes.

            <p>The Pope ſeeing the inſtruction of the French King, which did import the prolonging of the Councell, was much diſpleaſed. For he had conceiued hope, that all which did remaine to be diſcuſſed, might be defined in the next Seſſion of the 12. of Nouember, or if not, yet that the Councell would bee concluded, ſuſpended or diſſolued in the end of the yeere, at the lateſt. He therefore anſwered the French Ambaſſadour reſiding with him (who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the points of doctrine might bee deferred vntill the comming of their Prelats, and the matter of reformation handled in the meane time) that hee was informed that the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> meant to tarrie vntill the ſurpriſe
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:17208:307"/>
of <hi>Burges,</hi> &amp; to attend the King to <hi>Orlience,</hi> ſo that his departure out of <hi>France</hi> would be very late, and perhaps neuer, and that it was not iuſt to entertaine ſo many Prelates in <hi>Trent,</hi> vpon diſſeignes ſo remote, that the demaunds for delay were not made, becauſe the French-men deſired to goe to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell, but to put himſelfe and the Prelats to more charges, proteſting, that, if his money were conſumed by this meanes, he ſhould not be able to continue in aſſiſting the King. He made it a greater matter, that their Prelats had been expected eighteene moneths, and himſelfe lead along with diuers friuolous excuſes. He complained of his condition, that if the Councell vſeth any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect towards him, which it doth but ſeldome, the Ambaſſadours, there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſay it is not free, and yet themſelues to deſire him to ordaine a dilation, which is a thing more vniuſt, and more abhorred by the Fathers then any other. His concluſion was, that when hee had aſſurance or likelyhood of their comming, he would endeuour that they ſhould be expected, ſaying, hee had giuen order to bee aduertiſed, by an expreſſe Currier, of the Cardinals departure, that hee might preſently employ himſelfe in the buſineſſe, and, in the meane while, hee thought it not iuſt that the Fathers ſhould be idle. He ſayd the matter of reformation was more fit to bee deferred then this of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which doth not concerne him, as being a good Catholique, who will vndoubtedly not diſſent from others. But in matter of reformation it is fit to heare him, becauſe it doth concerne him, as beeing a ſecond Pope, hauing many Benefices, and a reuenue of three hundred thouſand Crownes of Church liuings, whereas himſelfe hath but one Benefice, wherewith hee is content; that notwithſtanding hee had reformed himſelfe, and all parts of the Court, to the hinderance and loſſe of many of his officers, and would do more, but that he ſaw plainely, that, by diminiſhing his reuenues, and by weakening the forces and the ſinewes of his Stae; hee encourageth the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, and expoſeth all Catholiques, who are vnder his protection, to the iniuries of his enemies. And, for the Countreys which are not ſubiect to him in temporall matters, he ſaid the ouerthrow of diſcipline did ariſe from themſelues, and from the Kings and Princes, who, with vnfit and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate requeſts, doe force him to make extraordinary prouiſions, and graunt vnuſuall diſpenſations; that his condition was miſerable, who if hee did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vnfit requeſts made vnto him, euery one complained of the iniury, if he granted them, all the inconuenience enſuing was aſcribed vnto him, and men began to ſpeake of reformation, as the Kings Ambaſſadours had done in <hi>Trent,</hi> in ſuch generall termes, that it cannot bee vnderſtood what they meane. Hee ſaid, let them come to particulars, and ſay what they would haue reformed in the Kingdome, and they ſhall haue ſatisfaction in foure dayes; that the Prelats in <hi>Poiſi,</hi> haue made many conſtitutions, which he wil confirme when he ſhall be requeſted: but to ſtand vpon vniuerſalities only, and to find fault with all that is done, without propoſing any thing, ſheweth they beare no good affection.</p>
            <p>The fourth ranke of Theologues remained, who were to handle the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority <note place="margin">The ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops aboue Prieſts.</note> of Biſhops aboue <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Thoſe who ſpake firſt followed the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> who ſay a <hi>Prieſt</hi> hath two powers, one to conſecrate the Body and Blood of CHRIST, and the other to remit

ſins, in the former wherof a <hi>Prieſt</hi> is equal, in regard a Biſhop hath not greater authority then a ſimple <hi>Priest,</hi> but inferior in the later, becauſe not the power onely of <hi>Order,</hi> but of iuriſdiction alſo is required. Others added that it was a more excellent action to giue authoritie to conſecrate, then to conſecrate, and therefore that the Biſhop was ſuperior in this alſo, who cannot only doe it himſelfe, but ordaine <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and giue them authority. But this beeing diſputed ſufficiently, they returned to handle the Articles of the <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> as being the ſame with this point of ſuperiority; and the queſtion beeing whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it doth conſiſt in <hi>Order,</hi> iuriſdiction, or in both, <hi>Antonius</hi> of <hi>Mont. Alcino,</hi> a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> ſaid, it ought not to be vnderſtood of an imaginary ſuperiority, conſiſting in preeminence, or perfection of action, but in ſuperioritie of gouernement, ſo that it may make lawes, giue commands, and iudge cauſes, as well in the Court of Conſcience, as in the externall; which ſuperiority is to bee diſcuſſed, becauſe it is denied by the Lutherans. He ſaid there muſt be an authority in the Church to gouerne it, the vnitie whereof could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be preſerued. Hee prooued it by the example of Bees, and Cranes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that in enery particular Church a ſpeciall authority was neceſſary to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne it, which was in the Biſhops, who haue part of the charge, the totality whereof is in the Pope as Head of the Church; which containing authority to iudge, and to make Proceſſes and Lawes, it muſt needes bee a power of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. Concerning <hi>Order,</hi> hee ſaid a Biſhop was of an higher degree then a <hi>Priest,</hi> hauing all the power of him, and two powers more; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding cannot bee called his ſuperiour; as a <hi>Subdeacon</hi> is foure degrees higher then a doore-keeper, yet not ſuperiour vnto him. Hee prooued this his opinion by the generall vſe of the whole Church, and all Chriſtian Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and alleadged diuers authorities out of the Fathers. Finally, hee came to the holy Scripture, citing many places of the Prophets, to ſhew that this authority is called the authority of a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> ſaying, that the vniuerſalitie of it was giuen to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when CHRIST ſaid, <hi>Feede my Lambes,</hi> and ſome of it imparted by <hi>Peter</hi> to the Biſhops, when he bad them, <hi>Feede the flocke which they haue in their cuſtodie.</hi> And this opinion had great applauſe.</p>
            <p>But before thoſe of this fourth ranke made an end of ſpeaking, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Prelates reſoluing the point ſhould bee handled whether Biſhops are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by CHRIST, after they had conſulted together, did conclude that it was better the firſt motion ſhould begin in the Congregations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, that themſelues might with more ſhew of reaſon, reſuming the things ſpoken before, diſcourſe vpon them, and compell others to doe the like. Therefore, in the Congregation of the firſt of October, <hi>Michael Oroncuspe,</hi> a Diuine of the Biſhop of <hi>Pampelona,</hi> ſaid to the ſeuenth, that being to qualifie or condemne a propoſition which hath many ſignifications, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to diſtinguiſh them, and afterwards to examine them one by one: and hee thought the propoſition whether Biſhops bee ſuperior to Prieſts to be ſuch. For one muſt diſtinguiſh whether they be ſuperiours <hi>de facto,</hi> or <hi>de iure.</hi> That they are ſuperiours <hi>de facto</hi> it cannot be doubted, becauſe preſent experience, and the Hiſtories of many ages doe ſhew, that Biſhops haue exerciſed ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority and <hi>Prieſts</hi> obedience. Therefore this Article being without queſtion, the other, <hi>de iure,</hi> remaineth to bee diſcuſſed. Wherein there is another am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguitie
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:17208:308"/>
alſo, whether <hi>Iure Pontificio,</hi> or <hi>Diuine.</hi> In the firſt ſenſe the caſe is cleere, that they are ſuperiours, there beeing ſo many Decretals which ſay it expreſſely: which howſoeuer it bee true and certaine, yet the Lutherans are not in this regard to be condemned for heretiques, becauſe that cannot bee an article of faith which is grounded only vpon the law of man, and deſerue to be condemned for denying the ſuperiority of Biſhops, onely in caſe it bee <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iure Diuino.</hi> He added that he thought this point very cleere, and that he could euidently prooue it, and reſolue anything alleadged to the contrarie, ſaying hee muſt not proceed further, beeing prohibited to ſpeake of it. And here he ſhewed that the Miniſtery of Confirmation and Ordination is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to Biſhops. And hauing ſpoken vpon the eighth Article, in conformitie of the others, he ended his diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iohannes Fonſeca,</hi> a Diuine of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granata,</hi> followed; who <note place="margin">The inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhops is diſcuſſed.</note> entred brauely vpon the matter, ſaying, it neither was, nor could be forbidden to ſpeake of it. For the Article being propoſed to be diſcuſſed, whether it be hereticall or no, it is neceſſary to vnderſtand whether it bee againſt fayth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which it cannot be, if it doe not repugne to the Law of GOD. He ſayd hee knew not whence the report came, that one might not ſpeake of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, by the very propoſition of the Article, it was commanded to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed. And here hee proceeded to handle, not the ſuperiority alone, but the inſtitution alſo affirming that Biſhops are inſtituted by CHRIST, and by his diuine ordination, ſuperiours to Prieſts. He ſaid, that if the Pope be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by CHRIST, becauſe hee hath ſaid to <hi>Peter, I will giue thee the keyes of the Kingdome,</hi> and, <hi>Feede my Lambes;</hi> Biſhops are likewiſe inſtituted by him, becauſe he hath ſaid to all the Apoſtles, That which you bind on earth ſhall be bound in heauen, and whoſe ſinnes you remit they are remitted, ſaying to them afterwards, Goe into the whole world, and preach the Goſpel. And (which is more) he ſaid vnto them, As my father hath ſent me, ſo I ſend you. And if the Pope be ſucceſſour of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Biſhops are ſucceſſors of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; alleadging many authorities out of the Fathers, that the Biſhops are ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles. And, in particular, he recited a long diſcourſe of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> in this point to <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Pope; and a place of the Actes of the Apoſtles, where S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Epheſians, that they were <hi>made Biſhops by the holy Ghoſt to gouerne the Church of GOD.</hi> Hee added, that to bee confirmed or created by the Pope, did not conclude that they were not inſtituted by CHRIST, or had not authority from him. For the Pope himſelfe is created by the Cardinals, and yet hath his authoritie from CHRIST: and Prieſtes are created by the Biſhop, who doeth ordaine them; but receiue their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from GOD: So the Biſhops receiue the Dioceſſe from the Pope, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from CHRIST. Their ſuperiority ouer Prieſts he proued to be <hi>iure diuino,</hi> by authoritie of many Fathers, who ſay that Biſhops doe ſucceed the Apoſtles, and Prieſtes the ſeuenty two diſciples. Concerning other particles of this point, he ſaid the ſame things which others had ſpoken before, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Simoneta</hi> was impatient, and turned often to his Colleagues, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">Which vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Cardinall <hi>Simoneta.</hi>
               </note> to interrupt the diſcourſe: but being entred into vpon ſo good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and heard by the Prelates with ſuch attention, hee knew not how to reſolue.</p>

               <pb n="598" facs="tcp:17208:309"/>
After him followed <hi>Antonius Groſſetus,</hi> a Dominican Friar, who, hauing briefly paſſed ouer the other articles, inſiſted vpon this. Hee ſtood much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wordes of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoken to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> in <hi>Miletum,</hi> exhorting them to haue a care of the flocke; ouer which the holy Ghoſt had made them ouerſeers: vpon which place hee made many obſeruations. He ſayd it was firſt neceſſary to declare that Biſhops haue not commiſſion for their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from men, for ſo they would be hirelings, to whom the Lambes doe not belong, becauſe the man, who had committed the care vnto them, beeing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, they had no more to thinke on. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to gouerne the people of GOD is diuine, giuen by the holy Ghoſt, to conclude that they could not be excuſed by any diſpenſation of man. He alleadged the famous paſſage of Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that euery Biſhop is bound to giue an account of CHRIST onely. Then he added that the Biſhops of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> were not of thoſe who were inſtituted by CHRIST our LORD, while hee was in the fleſh, but by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> or ſome other Apoſtle, or diſciple; yet no mention is made of the ordainer, but all is attributed to the holy Ghoſt, who hath not giuen authority to gouerne, but diuided a part of the flocke, and conſigned it to be fed. And here hee made an inuectiue againſt thoſe, who a few dayes before, ſayd, that the Pope doeth diſturbe the flocke, inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that it was not well ſpoken, and that it would bring againe into vſe that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did deteſt; <hi>I am of Paul, and I am of Apollo.</hi> He ſayd the Pope was the miniſteriall Head of the Church, by whom CHRIST, the principall Head doeth worke, vnto whom alſo the worke ought to bee aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, ſaying according to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that the holy Ghoſt doth giue the flocke to be gouerned. For the worke is neuer aſcribed to the inſtrument or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, but to the principall Agent; that this forme of ſpeach hath alwayes beene vſed by the Ancients, that GOD and CHRIST doe prouide the Church of gouernours; that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that CHRIST, aſcending to heauen, hath furniſhed the Church with <hi>Apoſtles, Euangeliſts, Paſtours,</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> ſhewing plainely that he did prouide <hi>Paſtours</hi> after he was aſcended into heauen, and that the inſtitution of <hi>Paſtours</hi> and <hi>Maſters,</hi> in which number Biſhops are, ought as much to be aſcribed vnto CHRIST, as vnto the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Euangeliſts</hi> themſelues. The Theologue perceiued that he diſpleaſed the Legates, and ſome more beſides; and fearing ſome bad <note place="margin">Antonius Groſſetus <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi>
               </note> incounter, as had happened vpon other occaſions, hee added that hee had ſpoken without premeditation, beeing caried along by conſequence of wordes; and heat of diſcourſe, not remembring that that point was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to be ſpoken of. And entring againe to examine the proper offices of Biſhops, and contradicting the Lutherans, who holde them for ſuperfluous, ſhewing they haue been very ancient in the Church, and come from Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall tradition, he concluded. The Legats did perceiue that this was the arte of <hi>Granata,</hi> and the other <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to giue the Prelats a field to enlarge themſelues in this matter. Therefore they tooke order that the contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion ſhould be defended by ſome of the foure Prelates, who onely remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſpeake the next day; and the Popes Prelats, vſed to this arte, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to contradict the Spaniſh Biſhops, if they had begun to ſpeake of this matter in the Congregations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="599" facs="tcp:17208:309"/>
The next day, the ſecond of October, two Diuines went about to prooue, that as the ſuperioritie of Biſhops was certaine, ſo it was hard to bee decided <hi>quo iure,</hi> and in caſe it were, would be of no fruit; and therefore was to bee omitted. Two others maintained, that it was <hi>de iure Pontificio.</hi> And Friar <hi>Simon,</hi> a Florentine, and a Diuine of <hi>Seripando,</hi> diſcourſed, according to the opinion of <hi>Caietanus</hi> and <hi>Catharinus,</hi> in this forme, that Biſhops are inſtituted by CHRIST, to gouerne the Church; that his Maieſty did create Biſhops all the <hi>Apostles,</hi> when he ſaid, I ſend you, as I haue beene ſent by the Father; that this inſtitution was perſonall, and ended with them; that one of them was conſtituted, to remaine perpetually in the Church, which was <hi>Peter,</hi> when he ſaid, not to him alone, but to all his ſucceſſion, <hi>Feede my lambes;</hi> that Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> did meane ſo when he ſaid, that <hi>Peter</hi> did repreſent the whole Church, which was neuer ſpoken of any of the other Apoſtles; that Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaid that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is not onely a Type and figure of the vnity, but that the vnity doeth begin from him. In this power, giuen onely to <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſors, the care of gouerning the Church is contained, and of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining other <hi>Rectors</hi> and <hi>Pastors,</hi> not as Delegates, but as Ordinaries, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding particular Prouinces, Cities, and Churches. Therefore when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether any Biſhop bee <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> one muſt anſwere affirmatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, One onely, the ſucceſſour of <hi>Peter.</hi> Beſides, the degree of a Biſhop is <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> ſo that the Pope cannot take order that there may be no Biſhops in the Church, but euery particular Biſhop is <hi>De iure Pontificio.</hi> Whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that he may create and tranſlate them, diminiſh or enlarge their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, giue them more or leſſe authority, ſuſpend them alſo and depriue them; which he cannot doe in that which is <hi>de iure diuino.</hi> For from a <hi>Priest,</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take away authority to conſecrate, becauſe he hath it from CHRIST, but may take iuriſdiction from a Biſhop, becauſe he hath it from himſelfe. And thus the famous ſaying of <hi>Cyprian</hi> muſt bee expounded; there is but one Biſhopricke, and euery Biſhop holdeth a part thereof <hi>in ſolidum;</hi> otherwiſe, it cannot bee defended that the gouernement of the Church, is the moſt perfect of all, that is Monarchicall, and muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall into an <hi>Holigarchie,</hi> which is the moſt imperfect, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by all thoſe who write of gouernment. Hee concluded, that <hi>quo iure</hi> Biſhops are inſtituted, by the ſame they are ſuperiour to Prieſts, and that, when this matter is to bee diſcuſſed, the declaration is to bee made thus. Hee alleadged Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> who ſaith, in many places, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſpirituall power dependeth on that of the Pope, and that euery Biſhop ought to ſay, I haue receiued part of that fulneſſe. He ſaid that the old ſchoole-men were not to be regarded, becauſe none of them had handled this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but the Modernes, hauing after that the hereſie of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> aroſe, ſtudied the Scripture and the Fathers, haue eſtabliſhed this trueth. The laſt Diuine laboured to contradict him, in that he ſaid the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were ordained Biſhops, ſaying, when he ſent them, as himſelfe was ſent by the Father, that he ſent them to preach, and to baptize, which belongeth not to a Biſhop, but to a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and that onely <hi>Peter</hi> was ordained a Biſhop by CHRIST, who after the aſcenſion, ordained the other Apoſtles Biſhops. Concerning the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of this Article, and the next, they all agreed to comdemne them.

And ſo the Congregations of the Theologues were concluded.</p>
            <p>After which the Legates, beeing obliged to propoſe the reformation, conſidering with themſelues what particulars might be propoſed not preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall, and yet might giue ſatisfaction, were much troubled. For that which would be gratefull to the Ambaſſadours, would damnifie the Court, and diſtaſte the Biſhops, neither could they meddle with any thing that wold pleaſe the Biſhops, which would not bee preiudiciall to <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <note place="margin">The Legates demand of the Pope by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters what they ſhall doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the reformation.</note> Princes. Their reſolution was to diſpatch a Currier to the Pope, and expect an anſwere, and in the meane time, to draw the buſineſſe in length, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Prelates ſpeake in the matter of <hi>Order.</hi> In particular, they gaue his Holineſſe an account of the contention which they did foreſee, concerning the Article of the ſuperioritie of Biſhops, in regard of the petition made by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>paniſh Prelates, and the entrance made by their Diuines. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they knew not their ende, yet, obſeruing how earneſt their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt was, and knowing how the Spaniards doe vſually ayme at things farre off, they could not chooſe but ſuſpect. They put him in minde that this was the time in which they promiſed to ſpeake of reſidence; whereof ſome motion was made already. For the Archbiſhop of <hi>Meſina</hi> demanded of thoſe of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Zara,</hi> what their opinion would bee, in caſe it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and many practiſes were diſcouered, though they were not able to penetrate the ground of them. That they gaue order to <hi>Otranto</hi> and <hi>Venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miglia,</hi> to learne cunningly of what opinion the Prelates would bee in caſe they propoſed to referre it to his Holineſſe; who, hauing ſounded them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, found that 60 would bee rigidly oppoſite, of whom there was but ſmall hope that they could poſſibly bee perſwaded. For howſoeuer the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Marquiſſe had, at their inſtance, dealt effectually with the Spaniards, yet he brought from them no more then this, that they would not oppoſe with bitterneſſe but deliuer their opinions quietly, and without cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. That they knew the <hi>maior</hi> part were of the contrary opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they depend on <hi>Rome;</hi> but they ought to diſburden their conſcience. That they were aſſured that this was not contrary to his Holineſſe, of whoſe religious and godly diſpoſition they could not doubt, but vnto the Biſhops onely who are about him. They added, that the Spaniards, hauing diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered that there was a purpoſe to remit the buſineſſe to his Holineſſe, ſayd the ſame was done in the matter of the Chalice, and that it was in vaine to hold a Councell to handle that which was of no importance, and to referre that which deſerueth prouiſion. They aduiſed him of the promiſe made to the Ambaſſadours, to propoſe the reformation, and of the impoſſibility to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it any longer, and being aduertiſed of the comming of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and the French-men, and vnderſtanding that they were full of conceits, and deſignes of nouitie, they concluded that they would vndoubtedly ioyne with the mal-contents of <hi>Trent.</hi> Therefore not knowing, in theſe ambiguities, what courſe to take, they told him they had reſolued to expect the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Holineſſe.</p>
            <p>The Pope being aduiſed, at the ſame time, from other places of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects <note place="margin">With whoſe aduertiſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and others his Holineſſe is much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</note> of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and particularly, that hee would reforme the election of the Popedome, that the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltramontans</hi> might alſo bee partakers of it, it pierced
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:17208:310"/>
deepely into his minde. Therefore reſoluing not to expect the blow, but to preuent, hee informed all the Italian Princes heereof, ſhewing them what a diſhonour it would bee to the Nation, if it ſhould ſucceede; that hee ſpake not for himſelfe, whom it did not concerne, but for publique reſpects, and for the loue of his Countrey. And knowing that a Spaniſh Pope could not bee acceptable to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in regard of the naturall propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Clergie hath, to free themſelues from the exactions of the King, and that a French man would haue pleaſed him leſſe becauſe of the enmity betweene the Nations, and that the greateſt part of his truſtie friends were in <hi>Italy,</hi> hee wrote vnto his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> to communicate vnto him the deſigne of the French men, to make a Pope of their Nation, that, by his meanes, they may poſſeſſe <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Milan,</hi> to which they pretend right. And, not to bee wanting on his part, that hee might remoue ſome of the foundations, on which the Cardinal might build, which were the abuſes of the times paſt, lately reuiued, he made a Bull in this matter; which howſoeuer it contained only the prouiſions formerly made by diuers Popes, which were antiquated; yet it might bee ſayd there was no neede of more reformation in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, becauſe the Bull did remedie all the inconueniences which happened, or, at the leaſt, tooke all ſtrength from them, ſo that it could not bee preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they were in force. And to him that would prognoſticate that it would not be obſerued, as others made before, it might bee anſwered, that hee who doth euil doth thinke ill, and that it is the duety of Chriſtian charity to expect good from euery on. The Bull was dated the ninth of October 1562. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards newes came, that many Congregations were held in <hi>Spaine,</hi> to make a generall reformation, and to giue commiſſion to the Ambaſſador, who was to goe to <hi>Trent,</hi> to make the Spaniſh Prelats ioyne, and aime all at one marke. The newes that the King would ſend another Ambaſſadour did pleaſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope nor the Legats. For the Marquis of <hi>Peſcara</hi> did much conforme himſelfe to the Popes will, and the Miniſters he vſed were of <hi>Milan,</hi> much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the perſon of his Holines and his kinred, and to Card. <hi>Simoneta,</hi> who imployed them in the Popes ſeruice vpon all occaſions. But the Count of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> who was deſigned to be ſent, had remained with the Emperor, and with the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and was very deare vnto them, and had their proiects imprinted in him. And they feared him the more becauſe there was a fame (and it was indeed ſo reſolued, though not effected) that he ſhould beare the name of the Emperors Ambaſſador, to auoid the difference of precedencie with <hi>France,</hi> but really ſhould be Ambaſſador of the K. And the Pope did ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for many cauſes, the coniunction of thoſe Princes; eſpecially in regard of the K. of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who, in diuers things, had ſhewed he was auerſe from him. And the nomination of the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> was more diſpleaſing to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not come before the Diet of <hi>Francfort</hi> was ended, which being likely to laſt vntil the end of the yeere, he coniectured the King had a purpoſe to prolong the Councel. But hauing receiued the laſt aduice from the Legats, he was perplexed moſt of all, ſeeing the Prelats, euen his owne alſo, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to make it longer, by meanes of vnſeaſonable perſwaſions, howſoeuer their intereſts did require a quicke diſpatch. He cauſed the letters to be read in Congregation of the Cardinals, and gaue order that euery one ſhould thinke
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:17208:311"/>
of the beſt meanes rather to oppoſe an infinitie of imminent difficulties, then to take away the preſent grieuance, in regard the Councell the longer it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the harder it was to bee managed. Neither could any order bee giuen from <hi>Rome,</hi> but, becauſe of the great diſtance, it was vnſeaſonable before it came to <hi>Trent,</hi> a thing which in continuance of time would produce ſome great inconuenience. Hee complained that the <hi>Vltramontans</hi> did conſent to prolong it, for their proper intereſts; the Emperor to gratifie the Duch-men, and to make his ſonne King of the Romans; <hi>France,</hi> to make vſe of it, in caſe of compoſition with the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> to keepe the Low Countreys in hope. He repeated all the difficulties which aroſe from the diuers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts of the Prelates in Councell, the armes which were diſcouered in the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and what was ſuſpected of the deſignes of the French-men, whoſe comming was expected.</p>
            <p>At this time, the French King ſent the Abbat of <hi>Mante,</hi> expreſly, to <hi>Rome,</hi> to giue the Pope an account of his reſolution, to accept the Decrees of the Councell, and of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> his going to <hi>Trent,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with many Biſhops to propoſe the meanes to reunite Religion in his Kingdome; becauſe both himſelfe and his Counſell were of opinion, that none was more ſufficient for that charge, as well for learning as for experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The Pope did ſeeme to bee pleaſed with the reſolution, both in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Cardinall, and in accepting the Decrees of the Councell. Hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the Legats and Fathers ſhould receiue the French Prelates honourably and courteouſly, expecting their aſſiſtance in matters of Religion in which they were ſo much intereſted, eſpecially the Cardinall, who is the ſecond Eccleſiaſticall perſon in the world, not much inferiour to a Pope. Hee ſaid the Biſhops had diſcreetely handled the points of reformation, in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>Poiſi,</hi> offering to cauſe the greater part of them to be confirmed by the Councell. Hee added, that hee was forced to haſten the ende of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node in regard of his great charge, which if it did continue long, hee could not bee able to continue in aſſiſting the King in his warre; ſo that hee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped hee would ioyne with him to conclude it. The concluſion of his diſcourſe was, that hee had no authoritie in Councell, but to approoue, or reiect the determinations of it, without which they would be of no force, and that his purpoſe was to goe to <hi>Bolonia</hi> when the Councel was ended, and to aſſemble all the Fathers there, that he might know them, and thanke them, and make the approbation. This French meſſenger gaue the Pope alſo the letters of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> of the ſame tenour, with an addition of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, to preſerue by all meanes, the authority of the holy Sea. The Pope aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him in particular what the Cardinal meant to propoſe; but receiuing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a generall anſwere, that is, neceſſary remedies for the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> hee anſwered, to make the Cardinall be thinke himſelfe what to doe, that all ſhould bee maturely aduiſed on, euery thing being decided in Councell by pluralitie of voyces.</p>
            <p>It was reſolued, in the Congregation of the Cardinals, to anſwere the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates that they ſhould labour to conclude the Article of reſidence, before the <note place="margin">The anſwere made to the Legates.</note> comming of the French-men, and to referre it to the Pope, without any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, if it were poſſible; but if not, yet, at the leaſt, with a Decree. If nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:17208:311"/>
could bee obtained, then to make the declaration with rewards and puniſhments, not touching the poynt, whether it were <hi>de iure Diuino.</hi> That the Article of the inſtitution of Biſhops ſeemed difficult, and of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and therefore that they ſhould procure that it ſhould be remitted likewiſe; which in caſe they could not doe, yet they ſhould inuiolably ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue not to ſuffer a determination to paſſe, that it was <hi>de iure Diuino:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning reformation, that his Holineſſe was reſolute that none ſhould med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Papacie, and Court, who already had made ſo many reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (which all the world did knowe) as that euery diſorder was redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and, if any thing remained, was willing to adde it; that, for all other matters, they ſhould tell all men plainely that the Pope did remit the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation freely to the Councell; and of thoſe things which were propoſed by the Imperialiſts, and decreed by the French-men in <hi>Poiſi,</hi> they ſhould propoſe in Councell what they thought expedient, but not reſolue, before they ſent aduiſe againe.</p>
            <p>The propoſition, to finiſh the Councell, was eſteemed by the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bee of greater moment; not becauſe the neceſſitie to doe it was not manifeſt, but becauſe they ſaw not the meanes, in regard ſo many things did remaine to bee handled, and that the Prelates could not bee induced to ſpeake briefly, nor to agree in their diſcourſes; which things were neceſſary for a ſudden diſpatch, and, without them, it was impoſſible to conclude, but in a long time. To ſuſpend it without conſent of the Princes, ſeemed dangerous and ſcandalous, in regard of the aduice, ſent by the Legates, that the Ambaſſadours <hi>de Ferriers</hi> and <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> had ſaid, that if the Councell were ſuſpended they would not depart from <hi>Trent,</hi> nor ſuffer the Prelates, their adherents, to goe, before they had commiſſion from their Princes, To haue commiſſion from them did require much time, becauſe they would vndoubtedly know one anothers minde, before they would anſwere. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they knew not what to reſolue in this matter, but to ſolicite the Legates, to diſpatch the points, which remained to bee handled. The comming of <hi>Loraine</hi> did trouble them more, being aduiſed, from diuers places, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the buſineſſe of the election of the Pope, hee meant to propoſe many nouities, about the collation of Biſhoprickes, pluralitie of Benefices, and, which was of no leſſe importance, the Communion of the Cup, marriage of Prieſts, and Maſſe in the vulgar tongue. And, preſuppoſing hee would not begin his iourney before hee had anſwere from the Abbat of <hi>Mante,</hi> ſent by the King and himſelfe, they gaue counſell to recall the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and to offer the legation of that Kingdome to <hi>Loraine,</hi> which they <note place="margin">The Cardinal of <hi>Loraine</hi> had a deſire to be Patriarch in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> did thinke might ſtoppe him, becauſe he ſo much deſired to command that Clergie, that hee had formerly plotted to make himſelfe Patriarch in <hi>France;</hi> but if he came, that more Prelates ought to be ſent to the Councel, and ſome Cardinals alſo, to counterpoiſe him. And the Cardinals of <hi>Bordiſiera,</hi> and <hi>Nauagero</hi> were named. But this reſolution was not then taken, becauſe they feared that <hi>Loraine</hi> would diſdaine, and take occaſion to doe worſe, and becauſe it was not ſo well knowen whether theſe were able to make ſo great an oppoſition, as alſo becauſe they were willing to know the opinion firſt of thoſe who were in <hi>Trent,</hi> for feare of giuing them diſtaſt. They conſidered
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:17208:312"/>
the charge which would increaſe, which was not fit to bee indured, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great vtilitie. Therefore they reſolued to write to the Legates, not to ſuffer any the leaſt diſcourſe concerning the election of the Pope; which if they could not reſiſt, yet they ſhould not giue any permiſſion, but rather returne to <hi>Rome,</hi> leſt they ſhould preiudice the Colledge of Cardinals, and <hi>Italie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, in <hi>Trent,</hi> the Deputies for compoſing the <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, hauing conſidered the opinions of the Diuines, made a draught; and put into it, that Biſhops are ſuperiours <hi>iure Diuino.</hi> For the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Zara,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Conimbria,</hi> chiefe of the Deputies, were of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But the Legates did not permit it, ſaying, that nothing ought to bee put into it which was not contained in the Articles; notwithſtanding that it ſhould bee thought on, if the Fathers did deſire it in the Congregations. The Spaniards therefore did immediatly reſolue to deſire it; and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, vnderſtanding ſo much, gaue order to their Prelates, who were wont to contradict, that, if this matter were propoſed, they ſhould bee ſilent, and not diſpute, that they might not giue the Spaniards occaſion to replie, by which meanes the Congregations might be drawen in length, and inconueniences ariſe, which happened in the matter of reſidence, but if the inſtance were proſecuted by <hi>Granata,</hi> or others, the Cardinall <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armienſe</hi> ſhould interrupt them, anſwering that it was not a poynt to bee handled in Councell, becauſe it was not controuerſed with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth of October 1562. when the firſt Congregation of the <note place="margin">The Arch-b. of <hi>Granata</hi> diſcourſeth concerning the inſtitution of Biſhops.</note> Prelates was held, the Patriarchs, and ſome Arch-biſhops, hauing approoued, in few words, the <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> as they were compoſed, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Granata,</hi> did ſo likewiſe concerning the ſixe firſt Canons; in the ſeuenth hee deſired it ſhould be ſayd, that Biſhops, inſtituted <hi>iure Diuino,</hi> are ſuperiours to Prieſts; ſaying, that hee might with reaſon deſire it, becauſe it was propoſed in this forme in the Councell, by Cardinall <hi>Creſcentius,</hi> vnder <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, and approoued by the Synode. For witneſſes hee brought the Biſhop of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouia,</hi> who aſſiſted, as a Prelat, in that Councel, and Friar <hi>Octauianus Preconius,</hi> of <hi>Meſsina,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Palermo,</hi> who beeing not then a Prelate, was there as a Theologue. He ſayd they muſt needes declare both of theſe two points, that is, that Biſhops are inſtituted <hi>iure Diuino,</hi> and are <hi>iure Diuino</hi> ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to Prieſts, becauſe it is denied by the heretiques: and hee confirmed his opinion at large, with many reaſons, arguments and authorities. He allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> who ſayth, that the <hi>Order</hi> of Deacons is included in that of Prieſts, that of Prieſts in that of Biſhops, &amp; that of Biſhops in that of CHRIST, who is Biſhop of Biſhops. He added Pope <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> who, in an Epiſtle to the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> wrote, that CHRIST had committed the Church V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall to them. That <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> vpon the Epiſtle to the Corinthians, ſaith, that the Biſhop holdeth the place of CHRIST, and is Vicar of the LORD. He added alſo the Epiſtle of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to <hi>Rogatianus,</hi> where hee often repeateth that the Deacons are made by the Biſhops, and the Biſhops by GOD: and that famous place of the ſame Saint, that there is but one Biſhopricke, and euery Biſhop holdeth a part of it. Hee ſayd the Pope was a Biſhop, others
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:17208:312"/>
are, becauſe they are all brothers, ſonnes of one father, which is GOD, and of one mother, which is the Church. Therefore the Pope doth alſo call them brethren; ſo that if the Pope bee inſtituted by CHRIST, ſo are the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops alſo. Neither can it bee ſaid that the Pope calleth them brethren in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilitie, or humility onely, becauſe the Biſhops alſo, in the incorrupt ages haue called him brother. There are extant Epiſtles of <hi>Cyprian</hi> to <hi>Fabianus, Corueli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Lucius,</hi> and <hi>Stephanus,</hi> Popes, where he giueth them the title of brothers; and of <hi>Auſtine,</hi> written in his owne name, and of the other Biſhops of <hi>Africa,</hi> in which the Popes, <hi>Innocentias,</hi> and <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> are likewiſe called brothers. But which is moſt plaine, not onely in the Epiſtles of thoſe two Saints, but of many others alſo, the Pope is called Colleague. And it is againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Colledge to conſiſt of perſons of diuers kindes: and if there were ſuch difference, that the Pope ſhould bee inſtituted by CHRIST, and Biſhops by the Pope, they could not be in one Colledge. In a Colledge there may bee an Head; as in this Colledge of Biſhops the Pope is Head, but for edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely, and, as it is ſaid in Latine, <hi>in beneficientem cauſam.</hi> St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Iohannes Syracuſanus,</hi> that when a Biſhop is in a fault, hee is ſubiect to the Apoſtolique Sea, but otherwiſe, all are equall, by reaſon of humility; which Chriſtian humility is neuer ſeparated from the trueth. He alleadged St. <hi>Ierome</hi> to <hi>Euagrius,</hi> that whereſoeuer a Biſhop ſhall bee, whether in <hi>Rome,</hi> or in <hi>Augubium,</hi> or in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or in <hi>Rheggio,</hi> all are of the ſame merit, and of the ſame Prieſthood, and all ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles. Hee inueighed againſt thoſe Theologues, who ſaid that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had ordained the other Apoſtles Biſhops. Hee admoniſhed them to ſtudy the Scriptures, and to obſerue, that power to teach throughout all the world, to adminiſter the Sacraments, to remit ſinnes, to binde and looſe, and to gouerne the Church, is equally giuen to all: and finally, they are ſent into the world, as the Father hath ſent the Sonne, And therefore as the Apoſtles had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, not from <hi>Peter,</hi> but from CHRIST, ſo the ſucceſſours of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles haue not power from the ſucceſſour of <hi>Peter,</hi> but from CHRIST him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Hee brought to this purpoſe the example of the tree, in which there are many branches, but one body onely. Then hee ieſted at theſe Diuines, who had ſaid, that all the Apoſtles were inſtituted by CHRIST, and made equall in authoritie, but that it was perſonall in them, and ought not to paſſe to their ſucceſſours, except that of, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> asking them, as if they had beene preſent, with what ground, authority, or reaſon, they were induced to make ſuch a bold affirmation, inuented within theſe fifty yeeres onely, expreſſely contrary to the Scripture, in which Chriſt ſaid to all the Apoſtles, <hi>I will bee with you, vntill the end of the world;</hi> which words becauſe they cannot bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of their particular perſons onely, muſt be neceſſarily vnderſtood of the ſucceſſion of all, and ſo they haue beene vnderſtood by all the Fathers and Schoolemen, to whom this new opinion is directly contrary. Hee ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, that, if the Sacraments be inſtituted by Chriſt, by conſequence the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of them are inſtituted alſo and hee that will ſay that the <hi>Hierarchie</hi> is <hi>de iure diuine,</hi> and the chiefe <hi>Hierarche</hi> inſtituted by his Maieſtie, muſt ſay that the other <hi>Hierarche<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> alſo haue the ſame inſtitution. That it is a perpetuall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the: Catholique Church, that <hi>Orders</hi> are giuen by the hand of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:17208:313"/>
but the power is conferred by GOD. Hee concluded that all theſe things being true and certaine, and denied by the heretiques, in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which the Biſhop of <hi>Segouia</hi> had collected, it was neceſſary they ſhould bee declared, and defined by the Synode, and the contrary hereſies condemned.</p>
            <p>Cardinall <hi>Varmienſe</hi> tooke occaſion hence to interrupt him, ſaying, as they had agreed, that there was no controuerſie of this, yea, that the <hi>Confeſsionists</hi> did maintaine the ſame. Therefore that it was ſuperfluous, and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to put it in queſtion, and that the Fathers ought not to diſpute of any thing in which the Catholiques and heretiques doe agree. <hi>Granata,</hi> riſing vp, replied, that the <hi>Auguſtane Confeſsion</hi> did not confirme this, but contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it, putting no difference betweene a Biſhop and a Prieſt, but by humane conſtitution, and affirming, that the ſuperioritie of Biſhops was firſt by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and afterwards by Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution. And hee demanded againe, that this definition might be made in the Councell, or the reaſons and authority, alleadged by him, anſwered. The Cardinall replied, that the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques did not denie theſe things, but onely did multiply iniuries, maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and inuectiues, againſt the preſent vſes. And ſome other replies paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing betweene them, <hi>Granata,</hi> full of diſdaine and heare, ſaid, hee referred himſelfe to the Nations.</p>
            <p>After this, there being ſome tumult raiſed and appeaſed, they ſpake of the other points, receiuing the things as they were propoſed, ſome grounding themſelues vpon the ſaying of <hi>Varmienſe,</hi> and ſome holding that the Pope onely is inſtituted <hi>iure diuino,</hi> vntill it came to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Zara,</hi> who ſaid, it was neceſſary to adde the words <hi>(de iure Diuino)</hi> to condemne that which the heretiques ſay to the contrarie, in the <hi>Auguſtane Confeſsion. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mienſe</hi> ſaid againe, that in that <hi>Confeſsion</hi> the heretikes did not diſſent in this; and <hi>Zara</hi> alleadging the place, and the words, the contention was ſo long, that the Congregation did end with it.</p>
            <p>In the Congregations following, the opinions were diuers alſo. In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Braga</hi> demaunded the ſame adiunct, ſaying, it could not be omitted. He prooued at large the inſtitution of Biſhops <hi>De iure Diuino,</hi> bringing reaſons and arguments, like to thoſe of <hi>Granata,</hi> and ſaid, that the Pope could not take from Biſhops the authoritie giuen them in their conſecration, which doth containe in it the power not onely of <hi>Order,</hi> but of iuriſdiction alſo, becauſe, in it, the people is aſſigned to him to be fed and gouerned, without which the Ordination is not of force; whereof this is a manifeſt argument, that to titular and por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atiue Biſhops a Citie is allotted, which would not be neceſſary if the Epiſcopall Order could ſubſiſt without iuriſdiction. Beſides, in giuing the Paſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>all this forme is vſed, that it is a ſigne of the power which is giuen him to correctvices. And, which is of more importance, when the Ring is giuen him it is ſaid, that with it he doth marry the Church; and, in giuing the booke of the Goſpell, by which the Epiſcopall Character is imprinted, it is ſaid; that hee muſt goe to the people, committed to him: and in the end of the conſecration, that prayer is ſay'd, <hi>Deus omnium fidelium Paſtor &amp; Rector</hi> which ſince hath beene in the <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals</hi> appropriated to the Pope, by turning himſelfe to GOD, and ſaying, that
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:17208:313"/>
his will is, that the Biſhop ſhould gouerne the Church. Moreouer, <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> the third ſaid; that the ſpiritual mariage of the Biſhop with the Church is a bond, inſtituted by GOD, not to bee looſed by the power of man, and that the Pope cannot tranſlate a Biſhop, but becauſe hee hath ſpeciall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to doe it; all which things would bee very abſurd, if the inſtitution of Biſhops were <hi>De iure Diuino.</hi> The Arch biſhop of <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſayd, that it ought to be declared that Biſhops are ſuperiors to Prieſts <hi>Iure Diuino,</hi> but reſeruing the authority in the Pope. The biſhop of <hi>Segouia,</hi> adhearing wholly to the concluſions and reaſons of <hi>Granata</hi> made a long repetition of the places of the heretiques; where they denie the ſuperiority of Biſhops, and their inſtitution to be <hi>De iure diuino.</hi> Hee ſaid, that as the Pope is ſucceſſour of <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo the Biſhops are of the <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> and that it was plaine by the Eccleſiaſticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and by the Epiſtles of the Fathers, that all Biſhops gaue an account one to another, of all that happened in their Churches, and receiued appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation thereof from others. The Pope did the ſame for the occurrences of <hi>Rome.</hi> Hee added, that the Patriarches, when they were created, ſent a circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Epiſtle to the others, to giue them an account of their Ordination, and faith, which was as much performed by the Popes to others as by others to them; that if the power of the Biſhops be weakened, that of the Pope is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo; that the power of <hi>Order,</hi> and iuriſdiction, is giuen to the Biſhops by GOD, and that the diuiſion of Dioceſſes, and the application of them to the perſon proceedeth from the Pope. He alleadged an authoritie of <hi>Anacletus,</hi> that Epiſcopall authoritie is giuen in the Ordination, with the vnction of the holy Chriſme; that the degree of a Biſhop is as well an <hi>Order</hi> inſtituted by CHRIST, as the Prieſt-hood; that all Popes, vntill <hi>Silueſter,</hi> haue either profeſſedly, or incidently ſayd it is an <hi>Order,</hi> which commeth immediatly from God, that the words ſpoken to the Apoſtles, <hi>Whatſoeuer yee ſhall binde on earth, &amp;c.</hi> giue power of iuriſdiction, which is neceſſarily conferred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Succeſſors; that CHRIST did inſtitute the Apoſtles with iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſince that time the Church hath euer inſtituted Biſhops in the ſame ſort. Therefore this is an Apoſtolicall tradition, and, it beeing defined that points of faith are taken out of the Scripture, and Traditions, it cannot bee denied that this of the Epiſcopall inſtitution is an Article of faith; and the rather, becauſe S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> doe put <hi>Aerius</hi> in the number of heretiques, for ſaying that Prieſts are equall to Biſhops, which they would not haue done if Biſhops had not beene <hi>De iure diuino.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifty nine Fathers were of this opinion, and perhaps the number had been <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Simoneta</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth practiſes in the point of inſtitution of Biſhops.</note> greater if many had not been ill at caſe at that time, of a defluction of rheume, which then did generally raigne, and ſome others had not fained the ſame impediment, that they might bee out of the crowde and offend none, in a matter, handled with ſuch paſſion; eſpecially thoſe, who, for ſpeaking what they thought in the matter of Reſidence, found they had incurred the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of their Patrons; as alſo if Cardinall <hi>Simoneta,</hi> when hee ſaw matters proceed ſo farre, had not vſed diuers perſwaſions, employing herein <hi>Iohannes Antonius Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="608" facs="tcp:17208:314"/>
apoſtacy from the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> to the great ſhame and damage of <hi>Italy,</hi> which hath no other honour aboue the Nations beyond the Mountaines, but that which it receiueth from the Papacy. <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> ſaid, it was fit that it ſhould bee declared <hi>quoiure</hi> all the <hi>Orders</hi> and degrees of the Church are inſtituted, and from whom they receiue authoritie. Some others adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him, and, in particular, <hi>Pompeius Picholhomini,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tropeia;</hi> who, making the ſame inſtance, added, that when all the degrees of the Church were handled, from the greateſt to the leaſt, and declared <hi>quo iure</hi> they were, he would deliuer his opinion alſo concerning the degree of Biſhops, if the Legats would giue leaue. In this number ſome briefely adhered to the opinion of others who had ſpoken in this matter, and ſome amplified the ſame reaſons, and turned them into diuers formes, ſo that it would be too long to make a narration of all the ſuffrages which are come into my hands.</p>
            <p>That of <hi>George Sincout,</hi> a Franciſcan Friar, Biſhop of <hi>Segna,</hi> doth well deſerue to be repeated, who, adhering to <hi>Granata,</hi> ſaid, that hee would neuer haue beleeued that any could haue doubted whether Biſhops are inſtituted, and haue authority from Chriſt. For it they haue it not from his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, neither can the Councell haue any from him, which conſiſteth of BB. that it is neceſſarie that a Congregation, though very populous, haue their authoritie from whom the particular perſons haue it, that if Biſhops are not inſtituted by CHRIST, but by men, the authoritie of them altogether is humane, and hee who heareth it ſpoken, that Biſhops are not inſtituted by CHRIST, muſt needs thinke that this Synod is a Congregation of profane men, in which CHRIST doth not preſide, but a power receiued precarily from men, and ſo many Fathers would in vaine reſide in <hi>Trent,</hi> to their great charge and trouble, becauſe hee who hath giuen the power to Biſhops; and the Councell, may, with more authoritie, handle the ſame things; and it would bee a great illuſion generally of all Chriſtendome to propoſe it, not onely as the beſt, but as the onely and neceſſarie meanes, to decide the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent controuerſies. He added, that he had beene fiue moneths in <hi>Trent,</hi> with this perſwaſion, that neuer any would haue doubted whether the Councell hath authoritie from GOD, and whether it may ſay as the firſt Councell of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> did, <hi>It ſeemed to the holy Ghoſt and to vs;</hi> that hee would neuer haue come to the Councell, if hee had beleeued that CHRIST had not beene in the midſt of it. Neither can any one ſay, that, where CHRIST aſſiſteth, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie commeth not from him; that if any Biſhop ſhould beleeue and thinke his authoritie to bee humane, it had beene great boldneſſe in him to denounce, in the former difficulties, <hi>anathematiſmes,</hi> and not rather referre all to him who hath greater authoritie. And if the authoritie of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell bee not certaine, it was fit in the yeere 1545. when this was firſt aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, that this matter ſhould haue beene ſifted, and decided what the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of Councels is, as is vſually done in places of iuſtice, where, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the cauſe, it is diſputed, and decreed whether the Iudge bee compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, leaſt in the end, there bee a nullitie in the ſentence, for want of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The Proteſtants, who doe take all occaſions to detract from, and wrong this holy Synod, cannot haue any more fit, then that it is not certaine of its
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:17208:314"/>
owne authoritie. He concluded, that the Fathers ſhould take heed what they did reſolue, in a point, which beeing reſolued truely, doeth eſtabliſh all the actions of the Councell, and if otherwiſe, ouerthroweth all.</p>
            <p>The nineteenth of October, all the Fathers made an ende of ſpeaking in this matter, except Father <hi>Laynez,</hi> Generall of the Ieſuites; who, beeing to ſpeake laſt, did purpoſely abſent himſelfe that day, that hee might haue a whole Congregation for himſelfe alone. And to make the cauſe hereof vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Laynez</hi> ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a whole congregation himſelfe. The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this point of the inſtitution.</note> we muſt returne a little backe, and remember, that when the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was ſet on foote in the beginning, the Legates thought that the aime was onely to make great the authoritie of Biſhops, and to giue them more reputation. But before the ſecond Congregation was ended, they perceiued, very late, by the voyces giuen, and reaſons vſed, of what importance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it was. For it did inferre, that the keyes were not giuen to <hi>Peter</hi> onely; that the Councell was aboue the Pope, and the Biſhops equall vnto him, who had nothing left but a preeminence aboue others. They ſaw that the dignitie of Cardinals, ſuperiour to Biſhops, was quite taken away, and that they remained meere Prieſts, or Deacons; that, by that determination, reſidence was inferred by a neceſſary conſequence, and the Court brought to nothing; that the preuentions and reſeruations were remooued, and the collation of Benefices was drawen to the Biſhops. It was noted that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Segouia</hi> had, a few dayes before, refuſed to admit one to a Benefice in his Dioceſſe, to whom it was giuen in <hi>Rome.</hi> And theſe things did ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more plainely, as new ſuffrages were dayly giuen, and new reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged. For theſe cauſes the Legates did vſe the ſollicitations aforeſaid, for feare that more Italians might ioyne with the Spaniards. Yet they were not able to preuaile ſo much, but that almoſt the halfe were of that opinion. And the other Papalins reprehended the Legates, becauſe they foreſaw not what might happen, but ſuffered ſuch great preiudices to come vpon them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they proceeded by chance, and admitted not counſels and aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of wiſe men; that, ſo ſoone as <hi>Granata</hi> deliuered his ſuffrage, they were put in minde to vſe effectuall ſollicitations, which afterwards they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to vſe, when it was too late; that by their want of care (if not malice in ſome) matters haue beene handled of the greateſt importance that can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly happen in Councell. They added, that the Ambaſſadour <hi>Lauſac</hi> had, by many ſollicitations, vſed to diuers of the Prelates, diſcouered himſelfe to be not onely a fauourer, but a promoter of that opinion; and conſidered what an addition would be made vnto it, when the French-men came, who were expected. And they ſpake ſo openly, that ſome words came to the eares of the Legates themſelues; who, ſeeing now the danger not foreſeene, thought (in regard the matter had proceeded ſo farre, and ſo many had put themſelues on that ſide) that it was not fit to thinke of diuerting the queſtion, but of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a temper, to giue the Spaniards ſome ſatisfaction. And, after long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, they determined to compoſe the Canon, with theſe words; That Biſhops haue the power of <hi>Order</hi> from GOD, and, in that, are ſuperiour to Prieſts; not naming iuriſdiction, for feare of making them ſuſpect. For, by ſuch a forme of wordes, it might be inferred, that the iuriſdiction remained wholly in the Pope, without ſaying it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="610" facs="tcp:17208:315"/>
They ſent Father <hi>Soto,</hi> to treat with the Spaniſh Prelats, concerning this forme, not ſo much with hope to remooue any of them, as to penetrate to what they might be brought. <hi>Granata</hi> gaue him audience, but no anſwere. He laboured with others alſo, and gained the reputation of a good Courtier of <hi>Rome,</hi> in ſtead of the other, of a good Friar, as he was before. And, to win ſome that wauered, and ſome who vnaduiſedly fell into that opinion, beeing otherwiſe deuoted to the Pope, they reſolued to vſe ſolicitations vnto them, that, vnderſtanding the difficulty, they might bee content to referre it to his Holineſſe, or, at the leaſt, to ſpeake more ſparingly. To performe this, with the two aforenamed, they ioyned the Archbiſhop of <hi>Roſano,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Ventimiglia.</hi> And, that thoſe who would acknowledge their error might haue colour to retire, they gaue order that <hi>Laynez</hi> ſhould make an exact ful Lecture on this matter; and, that it might be heard attentiuely, and make an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they would not haue him, as hath beene ſayd, ſpeake after the others, in the ende of the Congregation, but allowed him one wholly for himſelfe. The foure Ieſuits conſulted together concerning the opinion, and <hi>Caueglione,</hi> laboured more then the reſt. And, not to omit any good meanes of diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they buſied the Prelates in another matter. For, to returne to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of that Congregation, after that the Generall of the <hi>Serui</hi> (who was the laſt) had giuen his voice in conformitie of the Spaniards, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>Mantua</hi> admoniſhed the Fathers deputed for the <hi>Index,</hi> and ſhewed how important a buſineſſe they had in hand, in regard all ſubuerſions doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, and all hereſies are ſpread by meanes of bookes, he exhorted them to bee diligent, and to let the Synod ſee the end of the work quickly, he ſaid he knew it required much paines and time, but conſidered withal that all the Fathers would contribute their labours to the aſſiſtance of the deputies, ſaying, that the Congregations were ſpent in handling queſtions of no profite, and a worke ſo neceſſary deferred. Hee exhorted in the end, that this particular of the <hi>Index</hi> might be concluded in the next Seſſion.</p>
            <p>The morning being come, <hi>Laynez</hi> ſpake more then two houres, very fitly, <note place="margin">The diſcourſe of <hi>Laynez.</hi>
               </note> with great vehemence, and maſter-like. The argument of his diſcourſe had two parts; the firſt he ſpent in proouing, that the power of iuriſdiction was giuen wholly to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that none in the Church beſides hath any ſparke of it, but from him; and the ſecond, in reſoluing all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary arguments, vſed in the former Congregations. The ſubſtance was, that there is great difference, yea, contrariety betweene the Church of CHRIST and ciuill ſocieties. For theſe haue firſt their beeing, and then they frame their gouernement, and therefore are free, and all iuriſdiction is originally in them which they doe communicate to Magiſtrates, without depriuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of it. But the Church did not make it ſelfe, nor its gouernment, but CHRIST, who is Prince and Monarch, did firſt conſtitute Lawes, by which it ſhould be gouerned, and then did aſſemble it, and, as the Scripture ſaith, did build it; ſo that it is was borne a ſeruant, without any kinde of liberty, power, or iuriſdiction, and abſolutely ſubiect. For proofe hereof, he allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged places of the Scripture, in which the Congregation of the Church is compared to a ſowing, to the draught of a net, and to a building: and where it is ſaid that CHRIST came into the world to aſſemble his faithfull people,
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:17208:315"/>
to gather together his ſheepe, to inſtruct them, by doctrine and example. Then he added that the firſt and principall ground, vpon which CHRIST built the Church, was <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſion, according to the words which hee ſpake to him; Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> and vpon this rocke, I will build my Church. Which rocke howſoeuer ſome of the Fathers haue vnderſtood to be CHRIST himſelfe, and others the faith of <hi>Peter,</hi> or the confeſſion of his faith, yet the more Catholique expoſition is, that <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, who, in the Hebrew and Syriacke, is called a ſtone. And, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diſcourſe, hee ſayd, that while CHRIST liued in the mortall fleſh, hee gouerned the Church with an abſolute Monarchicall gouernment, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to depart out of this world left the ſame forme, appointing, for his <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and his Succeſſors, to adminiſter it as hee had done, giuing him full and totall power and iuriſdiction, and ſubiecting the Church to him, as it was to himſelfe. This he proued of <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen were giuen to him onely, and, by conſequence, power to bring in, and ſhut out, which is iuriſdiction. And to him alone it was ſayd; <hi>Feede,</hi> that is, <hi>gouerne my ſheepe, animals,</hi> which haue no part or iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in gouerning themſelues. Theſe things, that is, to bee a Key-keeper, and a <hi>Paſtour,</hi> beeing perpetuall offices, muſt bee conferred vpon a perpetuall perſon, that is, not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt only, but vpon all his ſucceſſion. So the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> from S. <hi>Peter</hi> to the end of the world, is true and abſolute Monarch, with full and totall power and iuriſdiction, and the Church is ſubiect vnto him, as it was to CHRIST. And as when his diuine Maieſtie did gouerne it, it could not bee ſayd, that any of the faithfull had any the leaſt power or iuriſdiction, but meere, pure, and totall ſubiection, ſo it muſt bee ſaid, in all perpetuitie of time, and ſo vnderſtood, that the Church is a ſheepefold, and a kingdome; and that which Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, that there is but one Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, and a part of it held by euery Biſhop, is to bee expounded, that the whole power is placed in one <hi>Pastor,</hi> without diuiſion, who doeth impart and communicate it to his fellow miniſters, as cauſe doth require. And in this ſenſe Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> maketh the Apoſtolique Sea like vnto a roote, an head, a fountaine, and the Sunne; ſhewing, by theſe compariſons, that iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is eſſentiall in that alone, and in others by deriuation or participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this is the meaning of the words, ſo much vſed by antiquitie, that <hi>Peter</hi> and the Pope haue fulneſſe of power, and the others are of their charge. And that he is the onely Paſtor, is plainely prooued by the words of CHRIST, when hee ſayd, he hath other ſheepe which hee will gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo one ſheepefold ſhould be made, and one Shepheard. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, meant in that place, cannot bee CHRIST, becauſe hee would not ſpeake in the future, that there ſhall be one Shepheard, himſelfe then beeing a Shepheard, and therefore it muſt bee vnderſtood of another Shepheard, which was to be conſtituted after him, which can be no other but <hi>Peter,</hi> and his Succeſſors. And here hee noted that the precept, <hi>Feede the flocke,</hi> is found but twice in the Scripture: once giuen by CHRIST to <hi>Peter</hi> onely, <hi>Feede my ſheepe:</hi> againe by <hi>Peter</hi> to others, <hi>Feed the flocke allotted to you.</hi> And if the Biſhops had receiued any iuriſdiction from CHRIST, it would bee equall in all, and no difference betweene Patriarches, Arch-biſhops, and Biſhops; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:17208:316"/>
could the Pope meddle with that authoritie, to diminiſh or take it all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as hee cannot in the power of <hi>Order,</hi> which is from GOD. Therefore he aduiſed them to beware, leſt, by making the inſtitution of Biſhops, <hi>de iure Diuino,</hi> they doe not take away the <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> and bring in an <hi>Oligarchie,</hi> or rather an <hi>Anarchie,</hi> Hee added alſo, that, to the end <hi>Peter</hi> might gouerne the Church well, ſo that the gates of hell might not preuaile againſt it, CHRIST, being neere vnto his death, prayed effectually that his faith might not faile, and gaue him order to confirme the brethren, that is, he gaue him a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of infallibilitie in iudgement of faith, manners and religion, binding all the Church to heare him, and to ſtand firmely in that which ſhould be determined by him. Hee concluded, that this was the ground of Chriſtian doctrine, and the rocke vpon which the Church was built. Then hee cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured thoſe who held there is any power in Biſhops receiued from CHRIST, becauſe it would take away the priuiledge of the Roman Church, that the Pope is the Head of the Church and Vicar of CHRIST. And it is very wel knowen what is conſtituted by the olde Canon, <hi>Omnes fiue Patriarchae, &amp;c.</hi> that is, that hee who taketh away the rights of other Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth iniuſtice, and hee that taketh away the priuiledges of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is an heretike. Hee ſaid it was a meere contradiction to ſay the Pope is Head of the Church and the gouernement Monarchicall, and then ſay that there is a power or iuriſdiction not deriued from him, but receiued from others.</p>
            <p>In reſoluing the contrary arguments, hee diſcourſed that, according to the order inſtituted by CHRIST, the Apoſtles were ordained Biſhops, not by CHRIST, but by Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> receiuing iuriſdiction from him onely; and many Catholike Doctours doe hold that this was obſerued: which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is very probable. But the others who ſay the Apoſtles were orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Biſhops by CHRIST, doe adde, that his Diuine Maieſtie in ſo doing, did preuent the office of <hi>Peter,</hi> by doing, for that one time, that which belonged to him, giuing to the Apoſtles that power which they ought to receiue from <hi>Peter,</hi> euen as God tooke ſome of the ſpirit of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and diuided it amongſt the ſeuenty Iudges. So that it is as much as if they had beene ordained by, and receiued authoritie from <hi>Peter;</hi> who therefore did remaine ſubiect vnto him, in reſpect of the places where, and the manner how to exerciſe the ſame. And howſoeuer it is not read that <hi>Peter</hi> did correct them, yet this was not for want of power, but becauſe they did exerciſe their charge aright. And hee that ſhall reade the renowned and famous Canon, <hi>Ita Dominus,</hi> will aſſure himſelfe, that euery good Catholique ought to defend, that the Biſhops, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the Apoſtles doe receiue all from <hi>Peter.</hi> Hee obſerued alſo, that the Biſhops are not ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles, but onely becauſe they are in their place, as one Biſhop ſucceedeth another, not becauſe they haue beene ordayned by them. To thoſe who inferred, that therefore the Pope might refuſe to make Biſhops, and ſo himſelfe remaine the onely man, he anſwered, it was Gods ordination there ſhould bee many Biſhops in the Church, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him, and therefore that hee was bound to preſerue them: but there is a great difference, to ſay a thing is <hi>de iure Diuino,</hi> or that it is ordained by God. Thoſe <hi>de iure Diuino</hi> are perpetuall, and depend on God alone, both in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:17208:316"/>
and in particular at all times. So Baptiſme, and all the Sacraments are <hi>de iure Diuino,</hi> in euery one of which GOD hath his particular worke, and ſo the Pope is from GOD. For when one Pope doeth die, the keyes doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to the Church, becauſe they are not giuen to it, but a new Pope beeing created, GOD doeth immediatly giue them vnto him. Now it is not ſo in things of diuine ordination, in which the generall onely proceedeth from GOD, and the particulars are executed by men. So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Princes and temporall powers are ordained by God,</hi> that is, that the generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, that there ſhould be Princes, commeth onely from him, but yet the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are made by the ciuill Lawes. After the ſame maner, Biſhops are by diuine ordination, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith they are placed by the holy Ghoſt, to gouerne the Church, but not <hi>de iure Diuino.</hi> Therefore the Pope cannot take away the generall order of making Biſhops in the Church, becauſe it is from God, but euery particular Biſhop, being <hi>de iure Canonico;</hi> may bee remooued by the Popes authoritie. To the oppoſition that then the Biſhops would be <hi>Delegati,</hi> and not <hi>Ordinarij,</hi> hee anſwered, that there was one iuriſdiction fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, and another deriued; and the deriued is either delegate, or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. In ciuill Common-wealths the fundamentall is in the Prince, and the deriued in all the Magiſtrates: neither are the Ordinaries different from the Delegates becauſe they receiue authority from diuers perſons, yea, all doe equally deriue from the Souereignty; but the difference ſtandeth, becauſe the Ordinaries are by a perpetuall law, and ſucceſſion, and the others haue a particular authority, either in regard of the perſon, or the caſe. Therefore the Biſhops are Ordinaries, becauſe they are made by the Popes law a dignity of perpetuall ſucceſſion in the Church. Hee added, that thoſe places where authoritie ſeemeth to bee giuen to the Church by CHRIST (as theſe, that <hi>it is a pillar and foundation of trueth, that hee who will not heare it, ſhall bee eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an Heathen and a Publicane)</hi> are all vnderſtoode in regard of its Head, which is the Pope, and therefore the Church cannot erre, becauſe hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, and ſo hee that is ſeparated from him who is Head of the Church, is ſeparated alſo from the Church. To thoſe who ſayd the Councell could not haue authoritie, if none of the Biſhops had it, he anſwered, that this was not inconuenient, but a very plaine and neceſſary conſequence, yea if euery particular Biſhop in Councell may erre, it cannot bee denied that they may erre altogether; and if the authoritie of the Councell proceeded from the authoritie of Biſhops, it could neuer bee called generall, becauſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the aſſiſtants is alwayes incomparably leſſe then that of the abſent. He <note place="margin">He prooueth that the Pope is aboue the Councell.</note> tolde them, that in this Councell, vnder <hi>Paul</hi> the third, principall Articles were defined, concerning the Canonicall Bookes, interpretations, paritie of Traditions with the Scriptures, by a number of flue, or a leſſe; all which would fall to the ground if the multitude gaue authoritie. But as a number of Prelates, aſſembled by the Pope to make a generall Councell, bee it how ſmall ſoeuer, hath the name and efficacie to bee generall from the Pope onely, ſo alſo it hath its authoritie; ſo that if it doeth make Precepts or <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> neither of them are of force but by vertue of the Popes fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture confirmation. And when the Synode ſayth, that it is aſſembled in the holy Ghoſt, it meaneth that the Fathers are congregated, according
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:17208:317"/>
to the Popes intimation, to handle that, which, beeing approoued by him, will bee decreed by the holy Ghoſt. Otherwiſe how could it be ſaid that a Decree was made by the holy Ghoſt, and could be made to be of no force by the Popes authoritie, or had neede of greater confirmation. And therefore in the Councels, be they neuer ſo frequent, if the Pope bee preſent, hee onely doeth decree, neither doeth the Councell any thing but approoue, that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Decrees; and therefore it hath alwaies beene ſayd, <hi>Sacro approbante concilio,</hi> yea, euen in reſolutions of the greateſt weight (as was the diſpoſition of the Emperour <hi>Frederic</hi> the ſecond, in the generall Councell of <hi>Lyons) Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius</hi> the fourth, a moſt wiſe Pope, refuſed the approbation of the Synode, that none might thinke it to bee neceſſary, and thought it ſufficient to ſay, <hi>Sacro praeſente concilio.</hi> And for all this the Councell cannot bee ſayd to be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, becauſe it is aſſembled for better inquiſition, for more eaſie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and to giue ſatisfaction to men. And when it giueth ſentence, it doth it by vertue of the Popes authoritie, deriued from God. And for theſe reaſons, the good Doctours haue ſubiected the Councels authority to the Popes, as wholly depending on it, without which it hath not the aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, nor infallibilitie, nor power to binde the Church, but as it is granted by him alone to whom CHRIST hath ſaid, <hi>Feede my ſheepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was not any diſcourſe in this Councell more prayſed and diſpray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <note place="margin">The cenſure of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</note> according to the affections, of the hearers. The Papalins ſayd it was moſt learned, reſolute, and ſubſtantiall, others did condemne it of flattery, and ſome of hereſie: and many made it knowen they were offended by his ſharpe cenſure, and that they purpoſed in the Congregations following, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute him vpon all occaſions, and to note him of ignorance, and temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who was ſicke at home when hee ſhould haue giuen his voice, told euery one that, when a Congregation was held, he would deliuer his opinion againſt that doctrine, without reſpect, which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard in former ages, was, within theſe fifty yeeres, inuented by <hi>Caietan,</hi> to gaine a Cap; that in thoſe times it was cenſured by the <hi>Sorbone;</hi> that, in ſtead of a celeſtiall Kingdome (for ſo the Church is called) it maketh it not a Kingdome, but a temporall tyranny; that it taketh from the Church the title of the <hi>Spouſe</hi> of CHRIST, and maketh it a ſeruant, proſtituted to a man. He will haue but one Biſhop inſtituted by CHRIST, and the others not to haue any authority but dependant from him, which is as much as to ſay, that there is but one Biſhop, and the others are his Vicars, to bee remooued at his pleaſure. Hee ſaid this ſhould excite all the Councell, to thinke how the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall authoritie, ſo much debaſed, might bee kept aliue, and that it may not come to nothing; becauſe euery new Cogregation of Regulars which doth ariſe, doth giue it a great ſhake. The Biſhops haue held their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie intire vntill the yeere 1050. when it receiued a great blow by the <hi>Clunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſian</hi> and <hi>Ciſtercienſian</hi> Congregations, and others which aroſe in that age, becauſe many functions, proper and eſſentiall to Biſhops, were, by their meanes reduced to <hi>Rome.</hi> But when the <hi>Mendicants</hi> beganne after the yeere one thouſand two hundred, almoſt all the exerciſe of Epiſcopall authoritie was quite taken away, and giuen to them, by priuiledge. Now this new Congregation, borne but the other day, which is neither ſecular nor regular
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:17208:317"/>
(as the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Paris</hi> did well obſerue eight yeeres ſince, knowing it was dangerous for matter of faith, a perturber of the Churches peace, and fit to deſtroy Monaſticall life) to goe beyond their predeceſſours, doth labour to take away all iuriſdiction of Biſhops, by ſaying it is not giuen them by GOD, and that they ought to acknowledge that they haue receiued it precarily from men. The Biſhop hauing repeated theſe things to diuers men, mooued many to thinke of the matter, who before did not regard it. But thoſe that were ſeene in Hiſtories did ſpeake no leſſe of that obſeruation, <hi>Sacro praeſente Concilio:</hi> which beeing in all the Canonicall Textes, ſeemed new vnto them all, becauſe they had not marked it. And ſome approoued the Ieſuites interpretation, and ſome, on the contrary, ſayd that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell had refuſed to approoue that ſentence. Some proceeding another way, ſayd, that the queſtion beeing of a temporall matter, and wordly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the buſineſſe might paſſe either one way or other; but that no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence could bee drawen from hence, that the ſame might be done in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of faith, or Eccleſiaſticall Rites, eſpecially it beeing obſerued, that, in the Councell of the Apoſtles, which ought to bee a rule and paterne, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was not made by <hi>Peter,</hi> in preſence of the Councell, nor by him with approbation, but the Epiſtle was intitled with the names of the three degrees, aſſiſting in that Congregation, Apoſtles, Elders, and Brothers, and <hi>Peter</hi> was included in the firſt, without prerogatiue. An example, which in regard of antiquitie, and diuine authoritie, is of more credit then all thoſe of the times following, yea then altogether. And, for that day, in reſpect of theſe other points, the diſcourſe of the Ieſuite gaue matter of talke throughout all <hi>Trent,</hi> and nothing elſe was ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>The Legates were not pleaſed that this remedie, applied for a medicine, did worke a contrary effect, perceiuing that, in the Congregations, the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would bee longer in giuing; neither did they know how to hinder it. For that Father hauing ſpoken more then two houres, it did not appeare how hee that would contradict him could be interrupted, eſpecially it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his owne defence. And vnderſtanding that <hi>Laynez</hi> enlarged his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, with purpoſe to publiſh it, they forbade him to impart it to any, that others might not take occaſion to write againſt it, obſeruing what miſchiefe ſucceeded, becauſe <hi>Catharinus</hi> publiſhed his opinion concerning Reſidence, whence all the euill did ſpring, which ſtill continueth ſtronger then euer. But hee could not forbeare to giue copies to ſome, as well to honour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and oblige the Papalins to his ſocietie, then riſing, as alſo to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in writing ſome particulars, deliuered with too much petulancie. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did make preparation to write againſt him; and this motion continued vntill the French-men came, who cauſed this difference to be forgotten, by bringing in others more conſiderable, and important. Yet the Papalins <note place="margin">The coming of the French men did hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of it.</note> continued their counſels againſt the Spaniards, and their practiſes with the Prelates, whom they thought they might winne. And a Spaniſh Doctour, called <hi>Zanel,</hi> did fitly offer himſelfe to the Legates, and propoſed meanes to put the Prelates of that nation vpon their defence, and giue them ſomething elſe to thinke on. And hee propoſed to them thirteene points of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which did touch them at the quicke. But they could not hence gather
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:17208:318"/>
the fruit they expected, becauſe thoſe reformations required others alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Court, which made them deſiſt, leſt, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, by taking one eye from their aduerſaries, they might looſe both their owne, The practiſes were ſo manifeſt, that, in a banquet of many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in the houſe of the French, Ambaſſadours, diſcourſing of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of ancient Councels, not obſerued in this, that the preſidents of the Synod, and the Ambaſſadours of Princes deliuered their voyces, <hi>Lanſac</hi> ſaid <note place="margin">The Legates giue auricular voyces.</note> aloud, that the Legates gaue auricular voyces; and was well vnderſtood by all that hee meant their practiſes.</p>
            <p>When theſe Congregations were held, <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> preſented the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours letters to the Legates; who wrote vnto them, that, hauing ſatisfied <note place="margin">The Emperor deſireth that the doctrine may be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and onely the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion handled.</note> themſelues in publiſhing the Canons of the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> they would forbeare to proceed in the Sacraments of <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Matrimonie,</hi> and handle the matter of reformation in the meane while, referring to their wiſdome to handle what part pleaſed them beſt, of thoſe things which were propoſed to them, in his name. <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> ſpake in conformitie of the letter, and made the ſame requeſt, that, the matter of <hi>Order</hi> being ſo farre proceeded in, they would, at the leaſt, forbeare to handle that of <hi>Marriage,</hi> that, in the meane ſpace, the Emperour might induce the Germanes in the Diet to goe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues to the Councell. For ſo long as the Dutch and French-men continue in their reſolution, not to goe to it, nor acknowledge it, the Fathers doe in vaine abide there, to their great coſt and incommoditie; and when his Maieſtie ſhall ſee they cannot be perſwaded, he will procure a ſuſpenſion of the Councel, thinking it will bee a greater ſeruice to God, and benefit to the Church, to leaue matters vndecided, and in the ſtate they are, expecting a more fit time for the conuerſion of thoſe who are ſeparated, then by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitating, (as hath beene done vntill that time) the deciſion of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, in abſence of thoſe who haue put them in diſputation, to make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants irreconciliable, without any benefit of the Catholiques; ſaying, that, in the meane while, they might treat of the Reformation, that the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall goods may bee diſtributed to perſons of deſert, and all haue part of them, and the reuenues may be well diſpenſed, and the part belonging to the poore not vſurped by any; and ſuch other things. In the end, hee demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of them, whether, the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> comming with the title of the Emperours Ambaſſadour, the difference betweene <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France</hi> for precedence will ceaſe. The Legates anſwered to this laſt, that they did not ſee what pretence the French-men could haue to contend; and, for the reſt, they ſayd they could not forbeare to handle the points of doctrine, but that, with them, they would handle the Reformation effectually, according to the order ſet downe by the Synode. They commended the Emperours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to deſire the Proteſtants to ſubmit, but added, that, for this hope, the Councell ought not to bee prolonged. For the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> in the Papacie of <hi>Iulius</hi> the 3. made meanes for the ſame, and obtained it alſo; but the Dutch-men proceeded with diſſimulation, to the damage of the Church, and of the Emperour himſelfe. Therefore it was not fit the Councell ſhould change its pace, before the Emperour was aſſured of the intentions of the Princes and people, aſwell Catholique as Proteſtant, and what kinde of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:17208:318"/>
they will yeeld to the Decrees made already, and to be made in this Councel and in the former, requiring the obſeruation of the Synode, with authenticall <hi>Mandats</hi> of the Prouinces and Princes, and obligation from them for the execution of the Decrees, that their coſt and labour may not be in vaine, and laughed at. And in conformity heereof they anſwered the Emperour.</p>

The Legats did not permit that any thing elſe ſhould bee handled in that Congregation, for the cauſe which ſhall be related.</p>
            <p>The Court in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Popes Miniſters in <hi>Trent,</hi> were no leſſe troubled with the Spaniards, and their adherents in Councell, then with the expectation of the comming of <hi>Loraine;</hi> and of the french-men; with which they were not ſo much mooued, ſo long as there was hope that ſome rubbe might ſtoppe them, as after that certaine newes came that they would <note place="margin">The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the French Prelates doth much trouble the Pope and Court.</note> keepe the day of <hi>All Saints</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Sauoy.</hi> The Cardinal, either vainly or of purpoſe, made it knowne at the french Court, before he parted, and in many places in the iourney, that he would handle diuers things in diminution of the popes authority and commodities of the Court, which beeing reported diuers waies, both in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> made an impreſſion in both places, that the generall intention of the French-men was, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Councel, and, according to occaſions, to diſcouer, and put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe their particular deſſeignes: and they had coniectures to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that it was not without the knowledge of the Emperour, and of other Princes and Lords of <hi>Germany.</hi> And howſoeuer they were aſſured, that the Catholique King held not full intelligence with them, yet they had ſtrong arguments to make them beleeue, that his deſſeigne was to prolong the Councel, or, at the leaſt, not to ſuffer it to end. To croſſe this purpoſe, they <note place="margin">How the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</note> determined to propoſe the abuſes of the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> and to let the Ambaſſadours vnderſtand that they would make prouiſion for them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Princes, who deſire a reformation in the Church, would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly endure any at all of themſelues, ſo that they thought, that if any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of importance were handled to their preiudice, they would forbeare, and make their Prelats forbeare alſo to ſpeake of things preiudiciall to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique Sea. Therefore after ſome packets had paſſed betweene <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> it beeing iudged a good courſe, the abuſes were collected, which were ſaid to be principally in <hi>France,</hi> and partly in other Dominions. And hence the reformation of Princes began, which, in the relation of the things that follow; will affoord vs much matter.</p>
            <p>Beſides, in <hi>Rome</hi> it was thought to bee a good remedie, that the Legates ſhould bridle the tranſcendent boldneſſe of the Prelates, vſing their authority and ſuperiority, more then they had done. And, in <hi>Trent,</hi> it was thought to
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:17208:319"/>
be a good courſe, to keepe the Prelates, their adherents, vnited, well edified, and ſatisfied. For howſoeuer the voyces of the contrary part might encreaſe, yet they ſhould euer exceede in number, and bee Lords of the reſolutions. And they thought fitte alſo proceed to finiſh the Councel, or ſuſpend, or tranſlate it. They wrot alſo, and made many of the popiſh Prelates to write to their friends and Patrons in <hi>Rome,</hi> that there could bee no better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution or prouiſion, then to giue occaſion, (which might eaſily bee done) that ſome Prince might deſire the <hi>ſuſpenſion,</hi> not ſuffering any to ſlippe: and, for this end, they demanded diuers <hi>Briefes</hi> to be ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>tranſlation, ſuſpenſion,</hi> &amp;c. that they might make vſe of them, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was offered. They counſelled the Pope alſo to goe to <hi>Bolonia</hi> in perſon. For beſides the receiuing of more frequent and freſh aduices, and the ſudden making of incident, and neceſſary prouiſions, hee might haue a colourable reaſon to tranſlate the Councel to that Citie, vpon euery ſmall occaſion, or to ſuſpend it; deſiring him that, as they had imparted nothing to the Cardinall <hi>Madruccio,</hi> ſo nothing might come to the eares of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>Trent,</hi> his vncle, who, for many reſpects, and particular intereſts would certainely vſe all meanes that it might not bee transferred from <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To quench the boyling heat in the controuerſie about the inſtitution of Biſhops, that it might not increaſe, by meanes of ſo many who were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to contradict <hi>Laynez,</hi> they would not hold any Congregation for many daies. But this leaſure did ſtrengthen their opinions, and they ſpake of no matter but of this, in euery corner, and almoſt euery day three or foure of them ioyned together, and went to ſome of the Legates, to renew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And, one day, the Biſhop of <hi>Gadici</hi> with foure more, hauing, after the propoſition made, added, that as they confeſſed that the iuriſdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Pope, ſo they were content it ſhould bee expreſſed in the Canon. The Legates beleeued that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> acknowledging their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, would confeſſe that all iuriſdiction was in the Pope, and deriued from him: but, deſiring a further declaration, that Biſhop ſaid, that as a Prince doth inſtitute in a Citie a Iudge of the firſt inſtance, and a Iudge of appeale, who though he be ſuperior, yet cannot take authority from the other; nor vſurpe the cauſes belonging to him, ſo CHRIST, in the Church, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted all Biſhops, and the Pope ſuperiour, in whom the ſupreme Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall iuriſdiction was, yet ſo, that others had theirs, depending on CHRIST alone. <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> complained to euery one, that ſo much time was loſt without holding any Congregation, which might bee profitably ſpent, but that the Legates did, according to their vſe, purpoſely ſuffer it to bee ſpent in vaine, that they might giue forth the Articles of reformation the laſt day, that there might not be time to conſider, much leſſe to ſpeake of them. But the Legates were not idle, ſtill thinking how they might finde a forme for this <hi>Canon,</hi> which might bee receiued, and changed it more then once a day: which formes going about, and ſhewing the heſitation of the Legates, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not onely encouraged in their opinion, but ſpake alſo with more liberty; ſo that, in a meeting of many Prelates, <hi>Segouia</hi> was not afraid to ſay, that one word would bee cauſe of the ruine of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="619" facs="tcp:17208:319"/>
Seuen dayes being paſt without any Congregation, the thirtieth of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Legates being in conſultation, as in the dayes before, all the Spaniards, with ſome others, required audience, and made a new inſtance, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and ſuperiority of Biſhops <hi>De iure Diuino,</hi> might bee defined, ſaying, that if it were not done, they ſhould faile to doe that which is iuſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in theſe times, for clearing of the Catholique trueth, and proteſting they would aſſiſt no more in Congregation or Seſſion. This being diuulged, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Italian Prelates agreed together in the houſe of Cardinall <hi>Simoneta,</hi> in the Chamber of <hi>Iulius Simoneta,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> and came to the Legates the next morning three Patriarches, ſixe Arch biſhops, and eleuen Biſhops with a requeſt, that it might not bee put into the Canon, that the ſuperiority is <hi>De iure Diuino,</hi> in regard it ſauoured of ambition, and was vnſeemely that themſelues ſhould giue ſentence in their owne cauſe, and becauſe the greater part would not haue it put in, the occaſion might not bee giuen to ſpeake of the Popes authority, which they would, and ought to confirme. When this was knowen in <hi>Trent,</hi> many did beleeue that this inſtance was procured by the Legats themſelues: whereupon after Euenſong, a greater number aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled themſelues in the veſtry, in fauour of the Spaniſh opinion, &amp; others in the houſe of the B. of <hi>Modena,</hi> for the ſame end: and there were foure other aſſemblies in the houſes of the Arch-biſhops of <hi>Otranto, Taranto, Roſano,</hi> and of the Biſhop of <hi>Parma.</hi> The tumult proceeded ſo farre, that the Legats were afraid of ſome ſcandall, and thought they could by no meanes hold the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at the time appointed, and that there was a neceſſitie to diſcuſſe ſome points of doctrine, and propoſe ſome matter of reformation, before they came to the reſolution of the Article which was the cauſe of ſo greate a motion. And <hi>Simoneta</hi> complained often that he had little aſſiſtance from <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Seripando,</hi> who howſoeuer they did ſome thing, yet could not hide their thoughts, which did incline to the aduerſaries.</p>
            <p>Letters of credence came from the Marquis of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> to the principall <note place="margin">The letters of the Marquis of <hi>Peſcara.</hi>

            <p>Thoſe Prelats were not deceiued in belcouing it did proceed rather from <note place="margin">The Legues vſe meane, to curbe the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Prelats.</note> the Miniſters, then the King. <hi>Simoneta</hi> vſed perſwaſions, at the ſame time, to another Spaniſh Secretarie of the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> that the Count bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to aſſiſt at the Councell, it was neceſſary hee ſhould come prepared, to keepe thoſe Prelates within their bounds, otherwiſe there would enſue, not onely preiudice to the Church of GOD, but to the dominions of his Maieſty alſo, becauſe their principall intent was to aſſume all authority to themſelues, and to haue free adminiſtration in their Churches. And hee perſwaded the Secretary of <hi>Peſcara</hi> to meete <hi>Luna</hi> on the way and to informe him of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, and boldneſſe of thoſe Prelates, and to perſwade that it would bee good ſeruice for the King to repreſſe them. In conformitie whereof <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mienſe</hi> wrote a long letter to <hi>Petrus Caniſius</hi> to the Emperours Court, that hee would vſe the ſame perſwaſion to the Count.</p>
            <p>The doctrine collected out of the voyces, deliuered in the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, being giuen foorth, they began againe to ſpeake their opinions concerning it the third of Nouember. But Cardinall <hi>Simoneta</hi> forewarned his adherents to ſpeake reſeruedly, and not to runne out into words of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, becauſe that time did require that mens minds ſhould rather be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Hauing ſpoken hereof three dayes, and returning often to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, by reaſon of the connexion of the matter, the Legates thought it neceſſary to propoſe ſome matter of reformation, eſpecially becauſe, the French-men approaching the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> ſaid publikely, that it was time
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:17208:320"/>
to begin to giue ſatisfaction to the French, and other Nations, deputing ſome Prelates of each, to conſider of the neceſſitles of thoſe Countreys, becauſe the Italians, neither in <hi>Trent;</hi> nor in <hi>Rome,</hi> could know them; that vntill then no reformation had been made, becauſe that which was decreed was to no purpoſe. But the Legats being to propoſe ſome thing of reformation, thought it neceſſary, that they might not giue occaſion of many inconueniences, to begin with reſidence.</p>
            <p>It hath been related already what the Pope wrote in this buſineſſe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, the Legates and their adherents were in continuall cogitation how to compoſe a Decree, that might ſatisfie his Holineſſe, without preiudice of the promiſe which <hi>Mantua</hi> made to the Prelates. For to propoſe at the firſt, the reference of it to the Pope, ſeemed contrary to that promiſe; and there was great difficultie what Decree to propoſe, which not beeing accepted, might giue them occaſion to returne to the buſineſſe of reference. They made a calculation of thoſe who might bee drawen to their ſide, and of thoſe who were totally oppoſite, and found that the Councell was diuided into three parts, almoſt equall, that is, into theſe two, and a third, who deſired a definition to bee made in Councell, without offence of his Holineſſe: of which there was hope to gaine the maior part, and ſo to ouercome the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Therefore they diuided themſelues, and perſwaded ſo effectually, <note place="margin">Some Prelates are ouercome by practiſes.</note> that, beſides others they gained ſeuen Spaniards, amongſt whom were <hi>Aſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, Salamanca, Tortoſa, Patti,</hi> and <hi>Elma,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Macera</hi> labouring ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly herein.</p>
            <p>Foure courſes were propoſed to come to the execution; one, to make a <note place="margin">For courſes propoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> Decree, onely with rewards and puniſhments; another, that many Prelates ſhould deſire the Legates, that the buſineſſe might be remitted to the Pope, which requeſt ſhould bee read in Congregation, hoping that, by perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo many would come vnto them, that their number would exceed the other, by one halfe; the third that the Legates ſhould propoſe the remiſſion in Congregation; the fourth, that the Pope ſhould preſently make an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall prouiſion, which ſhould be printed immediately, and publiſhed euery where before the Seſſion, that the oppoſites, beeing preuented, might bee <note place="margin">The obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt them.</note> forced to yeeld. To the firſt was obiected, that all thoſe who demaunded the declaration <hi>de iure Diuino,</hi> would bee contrary, and thinke that rewards and puniſhments cannot bee ſo effectuall as the declaration, eſpecially there being already Decrees of Councels and Popes, which haue neuer been eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and there would bee difference alſo concerning the rewardes and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments. That the Prelates will make impertinent demands; that, at the leaſt they will deſire the collation of Benefices with Cure. That they will demaund the abolition of the Priuiledges of the Regulars, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exorbitant things; and that they ſhall euer bee in danger of mutation after the propoſition made, vntill it bee paſſed in Seſſion, eſpecially when the French-men come, who may demaund a retractation. It was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the ſecond, that the Prelates could not bee brought to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, without clamour; that thoſe who were not called, would diſdaine and goe to the aduerſe part; that the aduerſaries alſo would make vnions, and clamours, and complaine of the practiſes. To the third was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:17208:321"/>
that the oppoſites would ſay, that the conſent was not voluntary, but for feare of ſeeming to diſtruſt his Holineſſe, and becauſe there was not liberty to ſpeake, and if it were refuſed, it were as much as to call the Popes authority into queſtion: beſides it would bee ſayd that this refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was deſired by his Holineſſe. Againſt the fourth was ſayd, that the Popes Bull being not read in Councel, occaſion was giuen to the Fathers to demaund the definition, and if it were, it might bee feared that ſome would demaund a greater prouiſion, and ſo all would ſucceede with ſmall reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Seeing ſo many difficulties they prolonged the buſineſſe, which did not giue ſatisfaction, becauſe it had beene publiſhed, that the Fathers ſhould ſpeake of it. Finally, beeing forced to reſolue, the ſixth of Nouember, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing that courſe to propoſe a Decree with rewards and puniſhments, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſome of the Fathers had ſpoken concerning the buſineſſe of that Congregation, the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> propoſed it in good tearmes, ſaying in ſubſtance; that it was a thing neceſſary, deſired by all Princes, and that the Emperour had often made requeſt for it, and complayned that this point was not immediatly diſpatched; and that, by troubling themſelues with vaine queſtions, which bee of no importance, the principall conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath been deferred; that this is not a matter which needeth diſputation, but a meanes onely remaineth to be found, to execute that which euery one thinketh to bee neceſſary; that the Catholique and moſt Chriſtian Kings had made inſtance for the ſame, and that all Chriſtendome did deſire to ſee the prouiſion; that this matter was ſpoken of in the time of <hi>Paul</hi> the third, and paſſed ouer by ſome, very impertinently, with ſuperfluous queſtions, which then were wiſely buried in ſilence; that it appeareth, by the ſame reaſons, that there is no neede to handle any thing now but that which was propoſed in the Decree. And, amongſt other things, hee ſayd, that they were confirmed by the ſpeach of the Ambaſſadour <hi>Lanſac,</hi> who had often ſhewed by good reaſons, that nothing was to bee required, but that reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould be executed, and that it was to no purpoſe to ſhew whence the obligation came. Amongſt other particles, there was in the Decree, that the Biſhops reſiding ſhould not be bound to pay Tenths, Subſides, or any other Taxe, impoſed by what authoritie ſoeuer, though at the inſtance of Kings and Princes. This mooued all the Ambaſſadours very much; but <hi>Lanſac,</hi> diſſembling, complained that the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> had named him, without telling him of it before, granting hee had ſpoken ſo much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but as a particular friend, not as an Ambaſſadour. And to make his complaint the more grieuous, hee found fault alſo, that the Catholike King was named before the moſt Chriſtian. Of the Tenths hee ſayd nothing, hoping that, by that which he had ſaid, and by ſome oppoſition, which the fauourers of <hi>ius diuinum</hi> would make, that forme of Decree would bee hindered. <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> ſayd onely, that hee did not beleeue that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours minde was as the Cardinall had propoſed. But the Secretary of the Marquis of <hi>Peſcara</hi> demanded openly, that the words might be amended, ſo that they might not preiudice the grace granted by the Pope to his Catholike Maieſtie, for the Subſidie of the Gallies. The Legates did beleeue they had by this meanes gained the Prelates: but after they vnderſtood the exception
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:17208:321"/>
for <hi>Spaine,</hi> they began to ſay amongſt themſelues, that they were fauoured in that which could not bee granted. For in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and vnden euery other Prince they ſhould bee forced to pay; and in the ſtate of the Church alſo, with a <hi>Non obstantibus,</hi> the grace would bee made of no force.</p>
            <p>The next day they paſſed from reſidence, to Epiſcopall <hi>Order.</hi> And <hi>Sego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia</hi> replied, that the inſtitution of Biſhops <hi>de iure Diuino,</hi> was handled, and <note place="margin">A difference betweene the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Segonia.</hi>
               </note> reſolued, in the ſame Councell vnder <hi>Iulius</hi> the third, with a generall conſent and that himſelfe had deliuered his opinion therein, and ſpecified the day and hour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when it was. The Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> cauſed the actes of that time to be ſearched, and that to be read by the Secretary which was then defined to be publiſhed, expounding them ſo, as that hee concluded that it was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decided, nor examined, nor propoſed in that manner, as it was ſayd by <hi>Segouia.</hi> The Biſhop anſwering, though reuerently in appearance, there paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo many replies, that they were forced to breake vp the Congregation. And becauſe ſome will perhaps deſire to knowe which of them ſpake with moſt reaſon, it will bee fit to recite heere that which was then decided in the Congregations, though not publiſhed in Seſſion, by reaſon of the ſudden diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of that Councell, before related. Three heads of doctrine were then compoſed, the third where of was inſcribed, of the <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> and of the difference of Biſhops and Prieſts: and hauing ſpoken much of the <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> it ſaith thus afterwards, as it is tranſlated <hi>verbatim</hi> out of the Latine. <hi>Beſides, the holy Synod doth teach, that thoſe are not to be bearkened vnto, who ſay that Biſhops are not inſtituted Iure diuino, it appearing manifeſtly, by the words of the Goſpel, that</hi> CHRIST <hi>our Lord hath himſelfe called the Apoſtles, and promoted them to the degree of the Apoſtleſhip, into whoſe place the Biſhops are ſubrogated; neither ought wee to thinke that this, ſo eminent and neceſſary a degree, hath beene brought into the Church by humane institution; for ſo wee ſhould detract from, and diſeſteeme the diuine proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for failing in the moſt noble things.</hi> Theſe were the wordes vſed in that point of doctrine. There were noted alſo eight Canons; the laſt whereof ſaid thus: Hee that ſhall ſay that Biſhops are not inſtituted <hi>iure Diuino,</hi> or are not ſuperiour to Prieſts, or haue not authoritie to ordaine, or that this doeth belong to Prieſts, let him be <hi>anathema.</hi> Euery one being prepoſſeſſed with an opinion, doth finde it in all this that is read; and it is not wonder, if each of thoſe two Prelates did finde his owne in the ſame words, which the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins did interprete onely of the power of <hi>Order,</hi> and the Spaniards of all, which containeth order and iuriſdiction. Yet ſome of the Popiſh Prelates did beleeue that <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſtudiouſly faining to thinke as they did, cauſed the old determination to bee read, not to confirme his owne opinion, but the Spaniſh, which ſecretly hee defended.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> beeing entred into <hi>Italie,</hi> the Pope could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the French-men, to cauſe that he ſhould be expected. And hee wrote to <hi>Trent,</hi> that they ſhould prolong the Seſſion, yet not ſo as to paſſe Nouember. The Legates receiuing aduice that the Cardinall was vpon the <hi>Lago di Garda,</hi> in the Congregation of the ninth of Nouember, <hi>Mantua</hi> propoſed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring of the Seſſion vntill the 26. of the ſame moneth, which <hi>Loraine</hi> not knowing, ſent <hi>Carlo de Graſsi,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Monte Finſcoue,</hi> and wrote letters
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:17208:322"/>
alſo to the Legates, that, if it would pleaſe them to tary for him, he would be in <hi>Trent</hi> within a few dayes. And they reſolued to make no more Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations vntill his comming, to giue him the more ſatisfaction. The Biſhop related, that the Cardinall did ſhew a good intention in all his diſcourſes, and that hee would ſend his opinions to his Holineſſe, that hee might ſee them; that the Prelates in his company came for the ſeruice of God, and with a good mind toward the Apoſtolique Sea, and did hope that their comming would make a concord in the Councell, and cauſe them to bee diligent in making a fruitfull reformation, without any reſpect of their owne intereſt; and many ſuch things hee ſaid: which though they were teſtified by <hi>Graſsi,</hi> and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Ambaſſador <hi>de Ferriores,</hi> yet the Popiſh Prelates did beleeue them onely in complement, and purpoſed to vſe all the remedies, deſſeigned both in <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Loraine</hi> entred <hi>Trent,</hi> and was met a mile on the way by Card. <hi>Madruccio</hi>

Hee rode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Cardinals <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Seripando,</hi> which honour they thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to doe vnto him, becauſe the ſame was done vnto him by <hi>Monte,</hi> and <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> Legates in <hi>Bolonia,</hi> when the Councell was helde in that Citie, at the time when he went to <hi>Rome</hi> for the <hi>Cap.</hi> In the euening he went to viſit the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and had audience the next day before the Legates, <note place="margin">He viſiteth the Card. of <hi>Mantua,</hi> had audience the next day, and maketh a ſpeach.</note> with the Ambaſſadours, <hi>Lanſac</hi> and <hi>de Ferrieres.</hi> He preſented the Kings let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters directed to the Councell, and then made a long diſcourſe, to ſhew his inclination to ſerue the Apoſtolique Sea, promiſing to communicate all his deſignes to the Pope, and to them the Legates, and not to deſire any thing, but to the good ſatisfaction of his Holineſſe. Hee ſaid, hee would not bee curious in vnprofitable queſtions, adding, that the two controuerſies, of the inſtitution of Biſhops, and of reſidence, which were ſpoken of euery where, had diminiſhed the authority of the Councell, and taken away the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the world held of it. For his owne part he profeſſed hee was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the opinion which doeth affirme them <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> yet though it were certainely true, hee ſaw no neceſſitie, or opportunitie to proceede to the declaration thereof; that the end of the Councell ought to bee to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite thoſe to the Church who were ſeparated; that himſelfe had beene at a parley with the Proteſtants, and had not found them ſo different, but that they may bee reduced, if the abuſes were taken away; and that no time is more fit to win them then this, becauſe it is certaine they were neuer ſo vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Emperour, as now; that many of them, and in particular, the Duke of <hi>Wittemberg,</hi> was willing to aſſiſt in Councell: but it was neceſſary to giue him ſatisfaction, by a beginning of reformation, in which the ſeruice of GOD did require that their Excellencies ſhould imploy their labour; hee ſhewed the deſire of the King, that fit remedies might bee applied to the neceſſities of his people, ſeeing that, as he had warre now with the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes,</hi> ſo if the abuſes were not prouided againſt, hee ſhould haue more to doe with the Catholiques, whoſe obedience will bee quite loſt; that theſe were the cauſes why his Maieſtie had ſent him to the Councell. Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that, of all the money which the Pope promiſed to lend the King, he
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:17208:322"/>
could receiue but fiue and twentie thouſand crownes, diſburſed by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> in regard of the limitations, put in the <hi>Mandats,</hi> becauſe they could not be exacted but vpon certaine conditions, to take away the Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes of all the Parliaments of the kingdome, a thing of ſo great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that there was no hope euer to receiue one pennie. In the end hee ſaid hee had brought new inſtructions to the Ambaſſadours; and therefore when hee had ſpoken to the Synode, in the Kings name, in the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, he would afterwards only deliuer his ſuffrage as an Arch-Biſhop, not medling with the affaires of the kingdome, but leauing the care thereof to them.</p>
            <p>The Legats anſwered, without conſultation, as euery one thought good, <note place="margin">The anſwere of the Legats.</note> commending his pietie and deuotion towards the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to impart all their affaires vnto him. They ſhewed what patience they vſed in ſuffering the libertie, or rather the licence of Prelats, in their ſpeeches, who went vp and downe, and mooued new queſtions: but now, his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie being ioyned with them, they doubted not but by his aduice and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance they might be able to repreſſe this great boldneſſe, and compoſe the differences riſen, and proceede heereafter in ſo comely a manner, that the world might receiue edification, which before had conceiued a bad opinion, that the euill will of the Proteſtants was too much knowne, who when they ſhew themſelues not auerſe from concord, then it is to bee doubted that they inuent new occaſions of greater difference; that it is certaine that they haue demanded a Councell, becauſe they thought it would bee denied them, and at the ſame time when they required it, they indeauoured by all meanes to hinder it, as now thoſe, who are aſſembled in <hi>Francfort,</hi> laboure that it may not proceede, and vſe meanes to the Emperour to interpoſe ſome impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that they hate the very name of the Councell, as much as of the Pope, neither haue they formerly made any other vſe of it, then to couer and excuſe their apoſtacie from the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> that there was no hope of their conuerſion, and therefore meanes only was to bee vſed to preſerue the good Catholikes in the true faith. They commended the pietie and good intention of the king, and ſhewed the deſire of the Pope for reformation and what hee had done to reforme the court, not regarding the diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his owne reuenues, and that hee had alwaies written to the Councell, that they would labour in the ſame buſineſſe, whereunto themſelues the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates were much inclined and diſpoſed, but were hindred by the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Prelates, which conſumed almoſt all the time; that if in <hi>France</hi> there bee danger to looſe the obedience of the Catholikes, it is a matter to bee treated of with his Holineſſe. Concerning the loane of money, they ſaide the paternall charitie of the Pope towards the King and Kingdome was ſo great, that they might bee aſſured that the conditions were put in for pure neceſſitie. And after diuers complements, they concluded that on Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day hee ſhould bee receiued in the generall congregation, to declare to the Fathers the occaſion of his comming, and to reade vnto them the Kings letters.</p>
            <p>The Legates were troubled with theſe wordes of the Cardinall, that hee would not meddle with the affaires of the Kingdome, but leaue them to the
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:17208:323"/>
Ambaſſadours, which were not conformeable to thoſe which <hi>Lanſac</hi> and <hi>de Ferrieres</hi> had vttered a little before; ſaying, they were glad of the Cardinals comming, becauſe they ſhould be eaſed of all paines, all being (as they ſaid) to depend vpon his Honourable Lordſhip. They concluded that they were to take heede of thoſe diſſimulations, and the rather, becauſe Cardinall <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneta</hi> had receiued certaine aduice from <hi>Milan,</hi> that the French Abbots, lodged in Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſaid they would ioyne with the Spaniards, Dutch-men, and Vltramontanes, and treat of matters which would not pleaſe the Court. Beſides, the French-men were heard to ſay in all their diſcourſes, that time was not to bee loſt in queſtions, but the reformation to bee ſpoken of; that they ought to begin with taking away pluralitie of Benefices, and that the Cardinall would bee the firſt to leaue them, to giue example; that diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations are to bee giuen <hi>gratis;</hi> that the <hi>Annates, preuentions</hi> and ſmall <hi>dates</hi> ought to be remooued, and onely one prouiſion made for a Benefice: ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying alſo the matter, that the Pope had a moſt excellent occaſion to gaine immortall glory, by making the foreſaid prouiſion, to ſatisfie Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to vnite, and appeaſe them by prouiding againſt theſe abuſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences; and that in recompenſe they would pay vnto his Holineſſe an halfe Tenth; that they were come thither, reſolute not to depart, before they had attempted to make all theſe prouiſions, how long ſoeuer they taryed there; that in caſe they ſaw they could not preuaile, they would make no clamour, but returne quietly into <hi>France,</hi> and make the ſame prouiſions at home. The Legats alſo had notice, that the Cardinall held great intelligence with the Emperour, and (which was of more importance) with the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who were manifeſtly inclined to giue ſatisfaction to the Princes of <hi>Germanie,</hi> who did vndoubtedly hate the Councell, and would bee glad it might not proceede, but diſſolue in ſome aduantagious manner for them, and diſhonourable for the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea</hi> and the Synode. They ſuſpected alſo the Catholike King in regard of an aduice which came to the Secretarie of the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> that the inſtruction being alreadie made in <hi>Spaine</hi> for that Count, it was reſolued to ſend <hi>Martin Gazdellone,</hi> who had beene Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie to <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, to bring him, inſtruction by word of mouth, which they would not commit to writing, by reaſon of diuers aduices which lately had come vnto them. And confronting this with another aduice receiued out of <hi>France,</hi> that the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> had, before he departed, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to his Catholique Maieſtie the petitions, hee purpoſed to handle in Councell, and knowing aſſuredly that he had beene ſolicited by <hi>Germanie,</hi> to make inſtance for the reformation, they doubted that the comming of that Cardinall might hatch ſome great nouitie, and were not pleaſed one iot with his ſpeach in the audience, concerning the comming of the Dutch-men to the Councell, conſidering the conference he had with the Duke of <hi>Wittenberg.</hi> In ſumme, preſuppoſing that a perſon of ſo greate authoritie and wiſedome would not haue come, without a ſure ground to build his deſignes vpon, they reſolued to ſend preſently all theſe conſiderations to the Pope. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing obſerued that whenſoeuer any extraordinaries came to <hi>Trent,</hi> or depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Prelats tooke occaſion to talke, to ſeeke out the cauſe, to whiſper, to make a noiſe, and to lay plots alſo, which, now that the Cardinall was
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:17208:323"/>
come, might produce more dangerous effects, they diſpatched ſecretly, and wrote that order might bee giuen to the Curriers to leaue their guide and baggage at the next Poſt to <hi>Trent,</hi> and enter ſlowly into the Citie, with the diſpatch onely.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall went not into the congregation at the day appointed, by reaſon of a ſmall feuer, which had ſeaſed on him; and therefore hee deſired they would proceede ſlowly, that he might be preſent before the reſolution. <note place="margin">The Legats deſired the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould bee giuen to the Curriers to enter ſecretly into <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> The Legates reſolued to giue him ſatisfaction, and therefore they began the Congregation later then they were wont. In which the French Biſhops and Abbats beeing preſent, a general muſter was made (the number of the Prelates beeing found to bee two hundred and eighteene) and a place aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to euery one. The next day, there beeing ſome difficulty about prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they made a new aſſignation of places, making all the Prelates to enter into the Congregation one by one, and conducting euery one to his ſeate. In thoſe Congregations none of the Frenchmen ſpake, either becauſe they expected the Cardinall to beginne, or becauſe they were willing to ſee the manner firſt. The nineteenth of Nouember the Arch-biſhop of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranto</hi> appointed a banquet at night for many Prelates, and hee that had <note place="margin">A factious banquet.</note> the charge to inuite them, ſaying, that they ought not to faile, in regard of the ſeruice they might doe the Apoſtolique <hi>Sea,</hi> by comming thither, it was immediately publiſhed in <hi>Trent,</hi> that the Popiſh prelates, were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to make a combination againſt the Frenchmen. This diſtaſted them much, and the more, becauſe after the banquet, they were aſſured that ſuch diſcourſes had been vſed at the table, and obſeruing that ſince their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ſome new Prelate did arriue euery day, they thought they were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted, and held to bee oppoſites. Therefore the Legates, to make ſhew of all confidence, and reſpect of honour to the Cardinall, in the Viſitations which each of them made while hee was ſicke, they perſwaded him to take ſo good an occaſion to compoſe the controuerſies which the queſtions haue made; a thing which would bee eaſie for him, and of great reputation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man hath been able to effect it. The Cardinall ſeemed to bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and offered his endeauours.</p>
            <p>The Pope, who in thoſe dayes had been in ſome danger, by reaſon of <note place="margin">A plot of the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope was ſicke.</note> a greate vnexpected accident, hauing recouered his health, receiued aduices from the Legates, and from diuers other places, by which the Frenchmen had paſſed, all vniformely full of their deſſeignes. Beſides, when hee was ſicke, <hi>Monſieur de l' Iſle</hi> vſed practiſes, and layd plottes, that, if hee had died, the Pope might bee created in <hi>Trent</hi> by Nations, and the <hi>Sea</hi> held vacant vntill the reformation were made. For ſo the Councell would bee free, and the new Pope would accept the reformation, which was eſtabliſhed before his creation. This mooued him moſt of all, as well becauſe euery man, and Princes eſpecially, are diſpleaſed when any thing is deſſeigned to bee <note place="margin">Troubleth his Holineſſe.</note> done after their death, as alſo becauſe hee was by this moſt aſſured, that the Frenchmen were reſolued to reforme the Court, and the Popedome. Theſe things, and the differences in <hi>Trent</hi> about the inſtitution of Biſhops and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, cauſed him to hold a Congregation euery day, and hee could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to tell euery one, that hee had no buſineſſe more important, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:17208:324"/>
to him then the Conncell. And relating in Conſiſtorie the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in <hi>Trent</hi> about the inſtitution, and the new propoſition of reſidence, hee breake out into this exclamation, that all the Biſhops beneficed by him were his oppoſites, and that hee maintained an armie of enemies in <hi>Trent.</hi> There was an opinion that hee ſecretly wiſhed ſome good ſucceſſe to the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and ſome aduantage to the Proteſtants in the Diet of <hi>Germanie,</hi> that the Councell might be diſſolued, and not by his meanes. But, <note place="margin">And maketh him exclaime.</note> beeing wholly bent to prouide remedies, he gaue order to the Biſhops who <note place="margin">Hee ſendeth ſome Biſhops to <hi>Trent,</hi> and withholdeth others.</note> were not parted from <hi>Rome</hi> as yet, to depart immediatly, and cauſed <hi>Marcus Antonius Boba,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aſti,</hi> Ambaſſadour for the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> reſiding with him, to goe thither alſo. On the other ſide, hee forbade the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Turris,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Ceſena</hi> to goe thither; the former, becauſe hee had defended reſidence to bee <hi>de iure diuino;</hi> with more conſtancie then the times did comport, in the Councell vnder <hi>Paul;</hi> the other becauſe hee was a familiar friend of the Cardinall of <hi>Naples,</hi> of whom hee doubted much, by reaſon of the ſlaughter of his two vncles, and of the executions made againſt his perſon: and hee feared, becauſe it was ſaid, that the Count of <hi>Montebello;</hi> father of the Cardinall, had, in his cuſtodie, an obligation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Fearing to be accuſed of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But howſoeuer his greateſt diffidence was in the Frenchmen, yet hee thought fit to diſſemble it. Hee ſent into <hi>France</hi> fourtie thouſand Crownes, the reſidue of the hundred thouſand which hee promiſed. And hee cauſed <hi>Sebaſtianus Gualterus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Viterbo</hi> and <hi>Ludouicus Antinori</hi> to goe to <hi>Trent,</hi> who, hauing bin in <hi>France,</hi> had ſome acquaintance with ſome of thoſe Prelats, and had made themſelues knowne to the Cardinall, vnder colour to honour him. And hee wrote to this Cardinall and to <hi>Lanſac</hi> letters full of complement, and confidence. Yet they thought that theſe men were ſent to diſcouer the Cardinals intention, and to obſerue his proceedings; and the rather becauſe they had receiued aduice from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Biſhop had exhorted the Pope not to be ſo much afraid, in regard the Cardinall alſo would finde difficulties and impediments, more then he beleeued hee ſhould, and ſaid that himſelfe would make more to ariſe.</p>
            <p>The 22. of Nouember, the Cardinall reſolued to enter into the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation the day following; and it was agreed that the Kings letters ſhould be read, and himſelfe make a ſpeach. But <hi>Loraine</hi> propoſed alſo, that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour <hi>de Ferrieres</hi> ſhould make another. To this the Legates did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, becauſe if this had beene once permitted, both hee and all other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, would ſtill bee deſirous to ſpeake, and propoſe, with danger of making greater confuſion; but, concealing this cauſe, they ſaid, that neither in this Councell, nor vnder <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Iulius,</hi> it was euer permitted to Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to ſpeake in Congregation, but onely when they were firſt receiued; and that without the Popes conſent they could not yeelde to ſuch a nouitie. But <hi>Loraine</hi> anſwered, that the Kings letter, and the inſtruction beeing new, it might bee called a new Ambaſſage, and that, the firſt entrance. After many anſweres and replies, <hi>Loraine</hi> hauing giuen his word, that they ſhould not deſire to ſpeake any more, the Legates, to giue him ſatisfaction,
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:17208:324"/>
and that hee might not haue cauſe of open diſtaſt, were contented.</p>
            <p>Therefore the next day, the Congregation beeing aſſembled, the Kings letter was read, with this inſcription. To the moſt holy and moſt reuerend Fathers, aſſembled in <hi>Trent</hi> to celebrate the ſacred Councell. In which hee ſaid, that, it hauing pleaſed God to call him to the Kingdome, it hath pleaſed him alſo to afflict him with many warres; but hath ſo opened his eies, that, howſoeuer hee be yong, hee knoweth that the principall cauſe of the euils is <note place="margin">The French Kings leters.</note> the diuerſitie of religion. By meanes of which diuine illumination in the beginning of his Kingdome, hee made inſtance for the celebration, of the Councel, in which they were then aſſembled, knowing that in them the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers haue found the moſt proper remedies to the like infirmities, and, that he was grieued, that being the firſt to procure ſo good a worke, hee had not beene able to ſend his Prelates with the firſt; the cauſes whereof beeing notorious, hee thought hee was ſufficiently excuſed; and the rather, becauſe the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> was now arriued; accompanied with other Prelats. That two principall cauſes hath mooued him to ſend that Cardinall; the firſt, his owne great and frequent inſtance, to haue leaue to ſatisfie his duty, in regard of the place he holdeth in the Church; the ſecond, becauſe, being of his Priuie Councell, and exerciſed from his youth, in the moſt important affaires of the Kingdome, he knoweth the neceſſity thereof, better then any other, and whence the occaſions doe ariſe: ſo that he will be able to make a relation vnto them, conformable to the charge which is giuen him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in his name the remedies which are expected from their wiſdome, and fatherly affection, as well for the tranquillity of the Kingdome, as for the generall good of all Chriſtendome. Hee beſeeched them to proceede herein with their wonted ſincerity, that they may come to an holy refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and that the ancient luſtre of the Catholique Church may appeare, in the vnion of all Chriſtendome in one religion; which will bee a worke worthy of them, deſired by the whole world, recompenced by God, and commended by all Princes. In concluſion, for the particulars; hee referred himſelfe to the Cardinall, praying them to beleeue him in whatſoeuer he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſhould ſay vnto them on his part.</p>
            <p>After this the Cardinall ſpake. In the begining, hee ſhewed the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <note place="margin">The ſpeech of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>

                     </gap>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine.</hi>
               </note> of the Kingdome, deplored the warres, the demolitions of Churches, occiſions of religious perſons, conculcation of the Sacrament, burning of the libraries, images and reliques of Saints, ouerthrowing of the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Kings, Princes, and Biſhops, and expulſion of the true Paſtours. And, paſſing to ciuill matters, hee ſhewed the contempt of the Kings Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, vſurpation of his rents; violation of the lawes, and ſeditions raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people. He attributed the cauſe of all this to the corruption of manners, to the ruine of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, and negligence in repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hereſie, and in vſing remedies inſtituted by God. Turning to the Ambaſſ. of Princes, he told them that that which they doe now behold at leaſure in <hi>France,</hi> they ſhall find at home, when it will be too late to repent, if <hi>France,</hi> tumbling downe with its owne weight, ſhall fall vpon places neere vnto it. He ſpake of the vertue and good diſpoſition of the King, the counſels of the Queene, and King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and of the other Princes, but ſaid, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:17208:325"/>
matter was expected from the Synode, whence the peace of God, which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, ought to come. That the moſt Chriſtian King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured hereof, in regard of his obſeruance towards that Synod, and of his ſorrow for the differences of religion, did demand two things of them. The firſt, that they would auoyd new diſcords, new and vnprofitable queſtions and cauſe a ſuſpenſion of Armes amongſt all Princes and States, that ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall may not bee giuen to the Proteſtants, and occaſion to beleeue, that the Synode doth more labour to incite Princes to warre, and to make confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and leagues, then to keepe the vnity of peace. That King <hi>Henry</hi> hath firſt eſtabliſhed it, and then <hi>Francis</hi> continued it, and that the preſent King, vnder age, and his mother, haue alwayes deſired it; which how ſoeuer it hath vnhappily ſucceeded, yet they might feare that the accidents of the warre would bee more vnfortunate. For all the ſtates of the Kingdome beeing in danger of ſhipwracke, one cannot helpe another. Hee therefore deſireth that ſome account may bee held of thoſe who are gone aſtray from the Church, pardoning them as much as may be done without offending God, and holding them for friends, as much as is poſſible, euen as farre as vnto the Altars. The ſecond requeſt, common to the King with the Emperour and other Kings and Princes, was, that a reformation of maners, and of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, ſhould bee handled ſeriouſly; wherein the King did admoniſh and coniure them by CHRIST our LORD, who will come to iudgement, that, if they meant to reſtore the authoritie of the Church, and retaine the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> they would not balance the incommodities of the French men with their owne. He ſaid hee was glad, that <hi>Italy</hi> was all in peace, and that <hi>Spaine</hi> did gouerne the Helme; but that <hi>France</hi> was fallen, and ſcarce held it with one finger. Hee added, that, if they will demand, who hath cauſed this tempeſt and fortune, hee can ſay nothing but this, that this fortune is come by our owne meanes, caſt vs into the Sea. Therefore that there was need of boldneſſe, and courage, to looke vnto themſelues, and the whole flocke. In the end, he ſaid, hee had ended his Legation, and, that the Ambaſſadours would ſay the reſt; but himſelfe and the Prelates who came with him, did proteſt that, after God, they would bee ſubiect to the moſt bleſſed Pope <hi>Pius,</hi> acknowledging his Primacie on earth, aboue all Churches, whoſe commands they will neuer refuſe; that they doe reuerence the Decrees of the Catholike Church, and of the generall Synod, that they did honour the Legates, offer concord and vnion to the Biſhops, and were glad that the Ambaſſadours were witneſſes of what they ſayd, all for the honour of the diuine Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>Hauing made an end of ſpeaking, the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> in few words, commending him for the pains he had taken for the ſeruice of God, ſaid, that <note place="margin">The anſwer.</note> all the Synode was glad of his comming, made honourable mention of his brothers, who in their profeſſion ſhewed no leſſe readineſſe in the ſeruice of God and the kingdome, and referred himſelfe to the anſwere which the Arch biſhop of <hi>Zara,</hi> deputed hereunto, ſhould make, in the name of the Councell. Who ſaid that the Synod was ſory to heare of the ſeditions and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of religion in <hi>France,</hi> whoſe quiet and tranquilitie was alwayes deare vnto them, and the more then, becauſe by the narration of his Excellencie,
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:17208:325"/>
they were ſo liuely ſet before their eyes, but hoped that ſhortly the King, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the vertue of his predeceſſors, would be able to repreſſe them, that the Synode will labour, by all means, to make the true worſhip of God knowne, to reforme maners, and reſtore tranquillitie to the Church, which end they might more eaſily attaine, if they were aſſiſted by his Excellencie, and the Prelates who came with him. Hee ſpake largely in commendation of the Cardinall, and concluded that the Synode thanked God for his comming, and gaue him ioy of it, and offered to giue care to whatſoeuer ſhould be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the Ambaſſadors, in fit time and place, not doubting, but that it would bee for the glorie of God, benefit of the Church, and great dignitie of the Apoſtolique Sea.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the Ambaſſador <hi>de Ferrieres</hi> ſpake. He began with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation <note place="margin">The ſpeech of <hi>de Ferrieres</hi> the French Ambaſſadour.</note> of the Kings diſpoſition, inclined to Religion, which appeared more by the comming and diſcourſe of the Cardinall; by whom it might be knowne, how great care <hi>France</hi> did take of the good of the Catholique Church, becauſe euery on might ſee that moſt potent reaſons had induced the King to ſend him, in regard he had euer imployed him in his counſell, in the greateſt affaires of the Kingdome, that the King could appeaſe all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in three dayes, and keepe all his Subiects in their naturall obedience, if he aimed onely at his owne good, and did not deſire to maintaine the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church, and retaine the dignitie and authoritie of the Pope in <hi>France;</hi> for which hee expoſeth to danger the Kingdome, his life, and the goods of all the Grandees and Nobles. And, deſcending to the requeſts, he added, that they would not be troubleſome, nor obſtinate in them, that they did demand nothing but that which all the Chriſtian world demandeth that the moſt Chriſtian King doth requeſt that which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of the Fathers in the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> that all his demaunds are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the holy Scripture, in the old Councels of the Catholique Church, and in the ancient Conſtitutions, Decrees, and Canons of the Popes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that the moſt Chriſtian King doth demand the reſtitution of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church to its integritie, by meanes of them the Fathers, conſtituted by CHRIST as the chiefe iudges, not by a Decree with a generall clauſe, but according to the forme of the expreſſe words of that perpetuall and diuine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, againſt which, neither vſurpation nor Preſcription can take place, ſo that thoſe good orders which the deuill hath taken away by force and concealed a long time, may bee reſtored, as it were, out of captiuitie to the holy city of God, and to the ſight of men. He exemplified in <hi>Darius,</hi> who compoſed the tumults of <hi>Iudea,</hi> not by armes, but by executing the ancient Edict of <hi>Cyrus;</hi> in <hi>Ioſias,</hi> who reformed Religion, by cauſing the booke of the Law to bee read and obſerued, which had been concealed by the malice of men. Then hee ſpake acutely, and ſayd, if they ſhall demand why <hi>France</hi> is not in peace, hee could anſwere nothing, but that which <hi>Iehu</hi> ſay to <hi>Ioram;</hi> How can there be peace, there remaining? and concealed the words following, but added, you know the text. Then he ſaid, that if they doe not ſeriouſly labour in the reformation, the aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of the Pope and of other Princes, will be in vaine, and the blood of thoſe who periſh, though iuſtly, for their owne ſinnes, will bee required at the hands of them the Fathers.
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:17208:326"/>
Hee concluded, that, before they would deſcend to the particulars which they meant to demand, they deſired that the things which they had begun to handle, might bee diſpatched quickly, that they might, as ſoone as was poſſible, apply themſelues to other matters of more weight, and of greater neceſſity in that time. The biting liberty of this Ambaſſadour did no leſſe diſpleaſe, then that of his Colleague <hi>Pibrac,</hi> at their firſt comming to <hi>Trent;</hi> but the feare they had of the French-men made them forget all.</p>
            <p>The next day the Congregations were continued, and the firſt was all ſpent by Friar <hi>Iaspar</hi> of <hi>Caſal,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Liria:</hi> who, to informe the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> of all the reaſons of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> did recapitulate, with great elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, whatſoeuer they had ſaid in this matter. He added beſides, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more in fauour of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> then to ſay that Biſhops are inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the Law of man; that by this meanes, their nouitie is approued, in making Preachers, or Predicants, or Miniſters to gouerne the Church, in ſtead of Biſhops inſtituted by CHRIST. He ſaid that to him that readeth the Epiſtles of Saint <hi>Gregorie,</hi> to <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to others againſt him, for calling himſelfe Vniuerſall Biſhop, it doth plainely appeare, that it cannot be ſaid, that the inſtitution of the Pope is from Chriſt, if it be not ſaid that the inſtitution of Biſhops is from him alſo.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> made a congregation of Prelats and French Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines in his owne houſe, to vnderſtand their opinion concerning the Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Biſhops; in which it was vniformely reſolued amongſt them, that they did receiue it from GOD, and that it did belong vnto them <hi>iure diuino.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Papalins are diſtaſted with the French Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.</note> And this ſingularitie of congregation was vſed afterwards by the Cardinall in all occurrences to the great diſtaſt of the Papalins, who ſaid hee helde a Councell apart, and feared that the Spaniards would imitate the example, which might in time make a manifeſt ſchiſme, as it happeneth in the firſt Councell of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> by the Congregations which <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Syrians</hi> held apart. But the Papalins had, amongſt the Spaniards <hi>Barthomeus Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Patti,</hi> who a Spaniard by nation, becauſe hee had a Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricke in <hi>Sicilie,</hi> had great intelligence in <hi>Rome,</hi> and had diſcouered all the Spaniſh practiſes and counſels.

Concerning the Ambaſſadours in <hi>Trent,</hi> he ſayd they were corrupted alſo. The Cardinall hee held to be a good Catholique, but inclined to impertinent reformations of Eccleſiaſticall Rites, of the vſe of the Cup, of taking away images, of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the vulgar tongue, and ſuch other things, whereunto hee was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> his brother, and others of his kinred, and that the Queene at his departure, had effectually perſwaded him to it, and giuen him twenty thouſand crownes.

            <p>The ſixe and twentieth of Nouember, deſtinated for the Seſſion, Cardinall <hi>Seripando</hi> propoſed in Congregation, that it might be deferred, in regard the Decrees which they were to publiſh were not eſtabliſhed. And he admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the Prelates of their long diſcourſes, by meanes whereof they could not determine any certaine day for the Seſſion, which therefore was neceſſarily to bee deferred during pleaſure. Hee tolde them that many of them ſpake of abuſes, not remembring that to ſpend ſo much time, in vaine diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without any fruit, was the greateſt abuſe of all, which was neceſſarily to be taken away, if they deſired to ſee the end of the Councell, with edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Loraine</hi> confirmed the ſame, and exhorted the Fathers to leaue thoſe queſtions, which were nothing to the purpoſe in that time, and to bee briefe and diligent in diſpatching the things already propoſed, that they may come to things of more importance and neceſſitie. Many of the Prelates did not conſent that the Seſſion ſhould bee deferred during pleaſure, and required a determinate time. To whom it being replied, that it was not poſſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew not when they ſhould end the matter now in hand, which was ſo much controuerſed amongſt them, it was concluded that the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:17208:327"/>
time ſhould bee ſet downe within eight dayes.</p>
            <p>The ſame day the Senator <hi>Molines</hi> arriued, ſent by the Marquis of <hi>Peſeara,</hi> to renew and giue ſtrength to the perſwaſions, vſed to the Spaniſh Prelates, in fauour of the Pope, which hauing beene made by the Secretary reſident, had done no good. Hee brought new letters of credence to them all from the Marquis, and laboured with great diligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which wrought a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect. For the Prelates did interprete it to bee a practiſe of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Arragon,</hi> brother of the Marquis, without any expreſſe commiſſion from the King. It appearing now, that the further they proceeded about this point of the inſtitution, the more difficultie did ariſe, the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> vſed meanes, that a temper might befound, that they might rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of thoſe ſuperfluities and come to the buſineſſe of the Reformation, that they might know what they might hope for from the Councell. And the Biſhop of <hi>Niſmes</hi> told them, when he gaue his voyce, that if the Fathers were delighted to decide a curioſitie, which in concluſion will bee nothing but words, yet they ought not to entertaine others with it, but deferring it vntill another time, to handle that now which is more neceſſary. <hi>Diego Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarruuias,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Citta di Rodrigo,</hi> who ſpake after him, excuſing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for ſpending time in that queſtion, ſayd, that, it hauing been propoſed by the Lords the Legates, the Prelates could not chooſe but deliuer their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. Wherewith Cardinall <hi>Simoneta</hi> beeing mooued, did denie that the propoſition was made by them; and <hi>Seripando</hi> did ſecond him more fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſayd, that themſelues aſſuming too much licence, did not thinke it ſufficient to diſcourſe of the ſuperioritie of Biſhops which was propoſed, but had ſet on foote alſo the other of the inſtitution, and added <hi>Ius diuinum</hi> vnto them both; and not contented with the patience vſed in ſuffering them to ſay what they will, they began alſo to lay the blame vpon the Legats. He ſharply reprehended their too much liberty in entring into theſe queſtions, and their boldneſſe in treating of the Popes power, vainly and ſuperfluouſly repeating the ſame things, more then tenne times, ſome alſo vſing friuolous reaſons, and fooliſh, vnworthy of that aſſembly. And, in the progreſſe of his ſpeach, perceiuing he had been too bitter, he began to ſet them downe a forme how euery Prelate ſhould giue his voyce in Councell. Speaking of the queſtions propoſed, hee ſhewed that both the oppoſite opinions were probable, and that in caſe that <hi>de iure Diuino</hi> had more probabilitie, yet it was not a thing to be decided in Councell. Hee could not by this meanes pacifie the mindes of many that were moued; neither did he abſolutely pleaſe the Cardinall of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,</hi> who made all poſſible demonſtration to gaine a good opinion. For he made meanes to know the men, and to informe himſelfe what was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be done, that he might not vndertake the buſineſſe before he knew it would ſucceed; and he affected alſo to be the man who ſhould compoſe the differences, and be iudge of the queſtion. For diſpatch of the matter, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was made to depute ſome Prelates of euery nation, as it were to compromiſe the reſolution by them. But it could not bee done, becauſe the French and Spaniards deſired an euen number of euery nation, and the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as they were more in number then the others, ſo they would haue a greater number in this deputation. <hi>Simoneta</hi> was the firſt to oppoſe this
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:17208:327"/>
propoſition, for feare of reuiuing the cuſtome of the Councell of <hi>Baſill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time a new matter of contention was prepared. For the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> gaue the Legates to vnderſtand, that hee was to come to <hi>Trent</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and not of the Emperour, but would firſt knowe what place would bee allowed him. The Legates called the French Ambaſſadours, and told them of it, deſiring them to finde ſome meanes to compoſe the difference for precedence. They anſwered that they were not <note place="margin">A queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine.</hi>
               </note> ſent to compoſe differences, but to hold the place due, and alwayes graunted to their King; that they meant not to preiudice the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> in any thing belonging to him, but to doe him all honour and ſeruice, as beeing a couſin, and a friend to their King, and that they had charge, if their place was not giuen vnto them, to make proteſtation of the nullity of the actes of the Councel, and to depart with all the French Prelates. The Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> propoſed this courſe, to make the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour ſet apart from the others ouer againſt the Legates, or vnder the Eccleſiaſticall Ambaſſadours, or vnder the Secular Ambaſſadours. But the Frenchmen were contented with none of theſe courſes, ſaying that by all meanes he ſhould haue his place after them, and no where elſe.</p>
            <p>In the Congregation of the firſt of December <hi>Melchior Auoſmediano,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhop <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Guadice</hi> cauſeth a great ſtirre in the Councel.</note> of <hi>Guadice,</hi> ſpeaking of that part of the laſt Canon, where it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that Biſhops, called by the Pope, are true and lawfull, ſaid, that the manner of expreſſing it did not pleaſe him, becauſe there were alſo Biſhops not called by the Pope, nor confirmed by him, who notwithſtanding were true and lawfull. For example he brought foure ſuffragans, elected and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Arch-biſhip of <hi>Salzburg,</hi> who take no confirmation from the Pope. Cardinall <hi>Simoneta</hi> did not ſuffer him to proceed, ſaying, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Biſhop of <hi>Slazburg,</hi> or other Primats did, was all by the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Friar <hi>Thomas Caſtello,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caua,</hi> and the Patriarch of <hi>Venice</hi> ſtood vp both at once, and ſaid that he ought to be put out of the Councell, as a Schiſmatike. And <hi>Egidius Falceta,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caurle,</hi> cryed aloud, Out with the Schiſmatike. And there followed a great noyſe amongſt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats, as well of whiſpering, as of feete, partly in offence of the Prelate that gaue his voyce, and partly in defence: which gaue but ſmall ſatisfaction to the Prelates beyond the mountaines.

            </p>
            <p>The next day, in which they were to determine the iuſt time for the Seſſion, the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> propoſed, that it might bee prorogued vntill
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:17208:328"/>
the ſeuenteenth; and if, in the meane while, the Decrees of reformation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loging to the matter which was handled, could not be put in order, it ſhould be deferred vntill the next Seſſion. The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> conſented for that day, but with condition, that the whole matter might be handled, and nothing deferred vntill the next Seſſion, in which it was neceſſary to beginne the generall reformation. The Arch biſhop of <hi>Prague, Fiue Churches,</hi> and the Orator of <hi>Polonia,</hi> agreed in the ſame opinion. and, after much conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, betweene thoſe, who (as the Biſhop of <hi>Niſmes</hi> had ſaid) would haue thoſe queſtions deferred vntill another time, and others, who would haue them decided, it was reſolued to appoint the Seſſion for the day aforeſayd, with order, that, to diſpatch all the matter, they ſhould hold two Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions euery day, and if they would not decide all, yet they ſhould publiſh thoſe Decrees which could bee made by that time, deferring the vndecided points vntill another, handling the reformation in the next Seſſion, before they entred into matter of doctrine. <hi>Mantua</hi> did alſo reprehend the noyſe made with feete, and wordes, the day before, concluding that, if hereafter they would not ſpeake with that reſpect and reuerence which might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeme their owne dignitie, the preſence of them the Legates, who repreſent his Holineſſe, and of the Cardinals and Ambaſſadours, who repreſent the Princes, they would goe out of the Congregation, that they might not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſo great diſorders. The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> commended the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and ſayd, that as the Legates ought not to goe out of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for any occaſion whatſoeuer, ſo it was moſt iuſt that the perturbers of it ſhould be puniſhed. The Biſhop of <hi>Caua</hi> would neither excuſe himſelfe for that which hee had ſaid, nor receiue the admonition with ſilence, though it was in generall, but ſaid, that the cauſes ought to bee remooued that the effects might ceaſe; that if the words of the Biſhop of <hi>Guadice</hi> had offended his owne perſon, he would haue endured it, for Chriſtian charitie, which as it requireth patience in wrongs committed againſt ones ſelfe, ſo it maketh men ſenſible of the iniuries done vnto CHRIST, whoſe diuine Maieſtie is offended, when the authoritie of his <hi>Vicar</hi> is touched, that hee had ſpoken well, yea, as well as might be, and confirmed the ſame with other words of the ſame ſence, which were generally condemned of petulancie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iacobus Gilbertus,</hi> of <hi>Nogueras,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aliffe,</hi> in deliuering his voyce, <note place="margin">The ſuffrage of the Biſhop of <hi>Aliffe</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the inſtitution of Biſhops.</note> ſaid, that, concerning the inſtitution of Biſhops, one could not ſpeake with better ground, then conſidering well and vnderſtanding the words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Epheſians. For as it is moſt true that CHRIST did rule the Church with an abſolute gouernment, while hee liued in mortall fleſh, as others had iudiciouſly ſaid, ſo it was a great vntruth which was added, that is, that, being in heauen, he hath abandoned the ſame gouernment, yea, hee doeth exerciſe it rather more then before. And this is it which he ſpake to his Apoſtles, at his departure; <hi>I am with you vntill the end of the world;</hi> adding alſo the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the holy Ghoſt; ſo that now alſo not onely the inward influence of graces commeth from CHRIST, as from the Head, but an externall aſſiſtance alſo, though inuiſible to vs, which doeth miniſter occaſions of ſaluation to the faithfull and driueth away the temptations of the world. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, beſides all theſe things, hee hath inſtituted alſo ſome members of the
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:17208:328"/>
Church for Apoſtles, Paſtours, &amp;c. to defend the faithfull from errours, and to direct them to the vnitie of faith, and knowledge of GOD. And vpon theſe he hath beſt owed a gift, neceſſary for the exerciſing of this holy office, which is the power of iuriſdiction, which is not equall in all, but ſo much as euery one hath, is giuen him immediatly by CHRIST. Nothing is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ord contrary to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> then to ſay, that it was giuen to one onely, to impart it to whom he liſted. It is true that it is not equall in all, but according to the diuine diſtribution, which, as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, that the vnitie of the Church might bee preſerued, did ordaine, that the ſupreame ſhould be in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and his ſucceſſors; not that it ſhould bee abſolute, and, according to the Prouerbe, that the will may bee a law, but, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, for edification of the Church onely, not for deſtruction ſo that it cannot bee extended to abrogate lawes, and Canons, made by the Church, for a foundation of gouernement. And heere hee began to alleadge the Canons cited by <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> in which the ancient Popes doe confeſſe themſelues to be ſubiect to the Decrees of the Fathers, and to the conſtitutions of their predeceſſors.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall <hi>Varmineſe</hi> interrupted him, and ſayd, that the ſubiect to ſpeake on was the ſuperioritie of Biſhops; ſo that this diſcourſe was beſide the matter. The Biſhop anſwered, that the authority of Biſhops being handled, it was neceſſary to ſpeake of that of the Pope. And <hi>Granata</hi> ſtood vp, and ſaid, that others had ſpoken of it ſuperfluouſly, not to ſay perniciouſly, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Laynez,</hi> and therefore that <hi>Aliffe</hi> might ſpeake of it likewiſe. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Caua</hi> ſtood vp, and ſayd, that others had ſpoken of it, but not in that manner; and whiſperings beginning to ariſe amongſt the Prelates, <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta</hi> made a ſigne to <hi>Caua</hi> to hold his peace, and admoniſhing <hi>Aliffe</hi> to ſpeake to the point, he quieted the noyſe. But he continuing to alleadge the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, as hee had begun, <hi>Varmienſe</hi> interrupted him againe, not ſpeaking vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him but making a formall diſcourſe to the Fathers, concerning that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He ſaid the heretikes pretend to proue, that Biſhops, elected by the Pope, are not true and lawfull, and that this is the opinion which ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but whether true Biſhops are inſtituted <hi>iure Diuino,</hi> or not, there is no difference betweene the heretikes and the Catholikes, and therefore the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion doth not belong to the Synod, which is congregated only to condemne the hereſies. He aduiſed the Fathers to abſtaine from ſpeaking things which might giue occaſion of ſcaudall, and exhort them to leaue theſe queſtions. <hi>Aliffe</hi> deſired to replie; but <hi>Simoneta</hi> with the aſſiſtance of ſome other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, did pacifie him, though with ſome difficulty.

And, hauing ſayd many things which ſerued partly to accord the opinions, but principally to reconcile their mindes, was a cauſe that the Congregation did quietly ende; and that words of humanitie and reuerence did paſſe betweene the Cardinall and the Biſhop.</p>
            <p>The fourth of December, the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> deliuered his opinion <note place="margin">The ſuffrage of the Card, of <hi>Loraine.</hi>
               </note> concerning the ſame matter, and ſpake at large, ſaying, that iuriſdiction was giuen by God immediatly to the Church. Hee alleadged the place of Saint
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:17208:329"/>
               <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that the keyes are giuen to <hi>Peter,</hi> not vnto one perſon, but vnto the vnitie, and, that <hi>Peter,</hi> when CHRIST promiſed him the keyes, did repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent all the Church, who if hee had not been a Sacrament; that is, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Church, CHRIST would not haue giuen them vnto him. And hee ſhewed a great memory in reciling the places word by word. Then he ſaid, that that part of iuriſdiction which is ioyned with Epiſcopall order, the Biſhops doe receiue immediatly from God; and declaring in what it doeth conſiſt, amongſt other things, hee ſpecified, that power of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is contained in it, inlarging himſelfe much in the expoſition of that place of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> in which CHRIST doeth preſcribe the manner of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly correction, and iudiciall of the Church, with authority to ſeparate the diſobedient from the body thereof. Then hee diſputed againſt that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, alleadging diuers reaſons taken out of the wordes of CHRIST, ſpoken to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and from the expoſition which S. <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope doeth giue vnto them in many places. Hee exemplified in many Biſhops who had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged all their iuriſdiction to come from the Apoſtolike Sea, and ſpake with ſo much eloquence, and in ſuch ſort, that it could not clearely bee diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, what his opinion was. Afterwards hee ſayd, that Councels had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie immediately from God; alleadging the words of CHRIST, Where two or three ſhall be aſſembled in my name, I will be in the middeſt of them, and the Councell of the Apoſtles, which aſcribeth the reſolution to the holy Ghoſt; and the ſtile of all Councels, in ſaying they are congregated in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt and, in particular of that of <hi>Constance,</hi> which ſayth plainely, that it hath authority immediatly from CHRIST. But hee added, that ſpeaking of Councels, his meaning was that the head ſhould bee ioyned with it, and that nothing was of more ſeruice for the vnion of the Church, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme well the Popes authoritie; that himſelfe would neuer conſent to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any thing in diminution thereof, and that all the Prelates and Clergie of <hi>France</hi> were of the ſame opinion. And returning to the inſtitution of Biſhops, and ſpeaking ſtill with the ſame ambiguitie, hee concluded in the ende, that the queſtion was boundleſſe. Afterwards exhorted the Fathers to leaue it, and himſelfe gaue a forme to the Canon, in which the wordes, <hi>iure diuino,</hi> were omitted; and, inſtead of them, it was ſayd, <hi>Inſtituted by</hi> CHRIST.</p>
            <p>The French Prelates, who ſpake then after <hi>Loraine,</hi> and the dayes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vſed not the ſame ambiguity, nor the ſame reſpect towards the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Sea, but maintained openly, that the authoritie of Biſhops was, <hi>de iure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uino,</hi> alleadging the reaſons, deliuered by the Cardinall, and expounding them; who howſoeuer, while they ſpake, leaned his head vpon his hand, as if hee had been diſpleaſed, yet they noted him for ambition, as if he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely procured a Comment to bee made vpon his opinion. But the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards were not ſatisfied with the French men; though they did openly defend their opinion, as well becauſe the Cardinall had ſpoken ambiguouſly, as for that hee and the other Prelates did not hold the inſtitution and ſuperiorritie of Biſhops <hi>de iure diuino</hi> to be neceſſary to be determined in Councell, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it ought to be omitted. And they were more diſpleaſed with the forme of the Canon, propoſed by the Cardinall, in which the words <hi>de iure
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:17208:329"/>
diuino,</hi> were left out, howſoeuer, more for their ſatisfaction, then for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reſpect, theſe words were put in, That they are inſtituted by CHRIST.</p>
            <p>The Frenchmen and Spaniards had the ſame end, to prouide againſt the ambition and auarice of the Court, which did domineere at their pleaſure, with precepts, vnprofitable, and of no fruit, and drew a great quantitie of money from Chriſtian nations, by collation of Benefices, and diſpenſations. But the Spaniards iudged, in regard of the deuotion which the people of their Countrey beare to the Pope, and of the inclination of the King, and of his counſell, abhorring nouities, if this had been done directly, and openly, it would haue raiſed a ſcandall, and could not haue been effected, and that the Pope would eaſily haue interpoſed ſo many difficulties with the Princes, that they ſhould neuer haue been able to come to the declaration thereof; but that according to the cuſtome of that nation, they ought to take their aime afarre off, and, by declaring that iuriſdiction and reſidence are from CHRIST, and <hi>de inre diuino,</hi> to put that order in reputation with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to withſtand the violent courſes which the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> might take againſt their perſons, that ſo in progreſſe of time, they meght haue meanes to reforme the Churches, for the ſeruice of GOD, and tranquillity of the people, reſtoring the libertie vſurped by the Romans.</p>
            <p>But the Frenchmen, who by nature doe proceede openly, and with paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, eſteeme theſe artes vaine. They ſaid, there would not want meanes at <hi>Rome</hi> to make them vnprofitable, and that they required ſo much time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could be brought to effect, that no good hope could bee concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of them; that the true meanes was, without art, directly and plainely to ruſh downe the abuſes, which are too cleare and manifeſt, and that there was no greater difficultie to obtaine this which was the principall end, then there was to obtaine the pretence, which, beeing obtained, would bee as much as nothing. And their councels were no leſſe different in another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular alſo. They all agreed; in iudging it neceſſary that the execution of the Decrees of the Councel ſhould bee ſo firme and ſtable, that it might not bee altered. But there was ſome difference betweene the Frenchmen and Spaniards, about the manner how to order that the Decrees of that Councel might neither bee derogated from, nor altered by the Pope, by <hi>diſpenſations; non obſtanties,</hi> and ſuch other clauſes of <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore the Frenchmen diſſeigned that the ſuperiority of the Councell aboue the Pope ſhould bee decided, or a conſtitution made, that the Decrees thereof could nither bee derogated from, nor diſpenſed with, which would bee an abſolute remedie. The Spaniards thought it a hard point, and therefore not to bee attempted, becauſe the Pope would alwayes bee fauoured by Princes, when hee ſhould complaine that his authoritiy was diminiſhed, and would bee aſſiſted by the greater part of the <hi>Italian</hi> Prelats, in regard of the dignity of their Countrey, and for many priuate intereſts. And, for themſelues, they thought it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that the Councell ſhould make the Decrees, purpoſing afterward to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a <hi>pragmatique</hi> from the King vpon them, by which meanes they would ſo bee eſtabliſhed, that the Popes diſpenſations to the contrary could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>Spaine.</hi>

The Legates diſpatched an expreſſe Currier, with a copie of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and of the animaduerſion of ſome Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts made vpon it; ſhewing that the Papall authority was in queſtion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that order ſhould bee ſent them what to doe. Whereof the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, when he knew it, was very ſenſible, and complained that hauing gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the copie before hee ſpake in the Congregation, and the Legates ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bee pleaſed, they had afterwards ſhewed ſo much diſtruſt of him. He <note place="margin">The Legates ſend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Card, of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine to Rome</note> ſaid hee thought it ſtrange, that feare was apprehended by euery thing that either himſelfe, or any of the French Prelates ſaid, or did. Hee complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that his Nation was wronged by the Italians, affirming, that, with his <note place="margin">Wherewith he is diſpleaſed.</note> owne eares, hee had hard ſome Italian Prelates ſcornefully vſe that ſcurrile prouerbe, which was already made common throughout all <hi>Trent,</hi> that is; That <hi>from the Spaniſh ſcabbe, we are fallen into the French poxe:</hi> of which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Frenchmen did complaine vpon euery occaſion, and the Spaniards al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Whoſe complaints, as the cuſtome is did more incite the curious; and <note place="margin">A diſgrace full prouerbe in <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> the ſuſpicions and diffidences btweene the Nations did, with very great danger, encreaſe: neither were the Legates and wiſer ſort of Prelates able to ſtop the motion, though they oppoſed both with authoritie and with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions.</p>
            <p>The, Frenchmen, being prouoked, did reſolue to make proofe of their libertie, and agreed that, in the Congregation of the ſeuenth day, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>Loraine</hi> ſhould not bee preſent, and that their Prelates who were to ſpeake ſhould vſe freedome, and that, if they were reprehended, their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours ſhould proteſt; and <hi>Lanſac,</hi> that they might knowe it and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, in preſence of many of them, ſaid to <hi>Antonius Lecius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Orange,</hi> one of the ſpeakers, that hee ought to ſpeake freely, and without feare, and that the Kings protection was ſufficient to maintaine him. This beeing reported to the Legates, was a cauſe that they were heard with much patience, though they ſaid that the inſtitution and iuriſdiction of Biſhops <note place="margin">The French opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</note> was <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> as well as that of the Pope, and that there was no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but in degree of ſuperioritie, and that the Popes authority is confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within the limits of the Canons, relating, and commending the ſtile of the Parliaments of <hi>France;</hi> that, when any Popes Bull is preſented which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth any thing contrary to the Canons receiued in <hi>France,</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it to bee abuſiue, and forbid the execution. This libertie made the Papalins vſe more reſpect in their ſpeaches, though the prouerbe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them ſo well, that ſometimes ſome of the merrie Prelates could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to vſe it.</p>
            <p>The pretence for the abſence of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> was the aduice of the death of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> which came to <hi>Trent</hi> that day. This <note place="margin">The death of the King of <hi>Nauar</hi> made a great change in <hi>Trent,</hi> and in <hi>France</hi>
               </note> Prince, wounded with a bullet at the ſiege of <hi>Roan,</hi> in September, was neuer well cured, and at the laſt, died. Neere vnto his death, hee receiued the Communion after the Catholique manner, at the perſwaſion of his Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Viſentius Laurus,</hi> and afterwards wauered towards the doctrine of the Proteſtants, and ſo died the tenth of Nouember. This accident made a great mutation in the Councell; and <hi>Loraine</hi> did ſuddenly change all his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeignes. For that King had a principall hand in the Commiſſions giuen to
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:17208:330"/>
the Cardinall at his departure, ſo that hee was vncertaine whether, after his death, the Queene, and others, would continue in the ſame heat. Beſides, he ſaw a manifeſt change in the whole gouernement, and therefore deſired to bee in <hi>France,</hi> that himſelfe might beare part of it alſo. For the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> beeing in open diſſention, diſtruſting the Queene and thoſe who had power with her, the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon</hi> vncapable, <hi>Montpenſier</hi> in ſmall credit, the <hi>Constable</hi> old, of whom many alſo were emulous, hee had a great conceit that his brother might bee the Chiefe for Armes, and himſelfe for counſell. And hee ruminated theſe things in his minde, thinking but little of the Councell, and of <hi>Trent,</hi> where hee was. The other French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſayd openly, they ought to thanke God for the death of the King, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to wauer, and to ioyne his owne intereſts with thoſe of his brother, and of the other <hi>Hugonots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, being the eighth of December, was all ſpent in ceremonies, for the election of <hi>Maximilian</hi> King of the Romanes. The Arch biſhop of <hi>Prague</hi> ſang the Maſſe of the holy Ghoſt, with the aſſiſtance of the whole Councell: the Biſhop of <hi>Tininia</hi> made a ſermon, in commendation of the Prince, and the Cardinals and Ambaſſadours were inuited by <hi>Prague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſoone as the Diet was aſſembled in <hi>Francfort,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> ſent, not onely to demaund aſſiſtance from the Proteſtant Princes, but alſo to treat an vnion of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> with thoſe of the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausburg;</hi> and in particular, to make a ioynt demand for a free new Councel, in which the reſolutions of <hi>Trent</hi> might bee examined, the French-men of the old Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Religion giuing hope alſo that they would agree vnto it, becauſe it had been promiſed to the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> (who afterwards was created Cardinall <hi>della Bordiſsiera)</hi> that it ſhould be done. But the Dutch Proteſtants were moſt auerſe from the Councell, ſo long as <hi>Germany</hi> might bee in peace without it. And therefore a booke was printed in <hi>Francfort,</hi> full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and reaſons, why they neither would, nor could come to <hi>Trent,</hi> with proteſtation of the nullitie of all that was, and would be done in that place.</p>
            <p>The King was firſt anointed, and crowned King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in <hi>Prague,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia.</hi>
               </note> in preſence of his father, the Emperour, by that Arch-biſhop who went from <hi>Trent</hi> into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to performe that ceremonie, that the King might haue a voyce in the Imperiall Diet. Beeing come to <hi>Francfort,</hi> they were forced to expect vntill the Canons of <hi>Colon</hi> had elected their Arch-biſhop, becauſe that Sea was then void; ſo that the Princes had much time to handle many matters, expecting ſtill in that place, that the number of ſeuen might bee full, by the Coronation in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and the election in <hi>Colen.</hi> They were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in <hi>Rome</hi> with theſe thimgs, and afraid, that the Diet would ſend to <hi>Trent,</hi> to proteſt, and that ſome new forme would bee vſed in the corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the old aboliſhed, which would ſhew an inclination to depart from the ancient Rites; or that ſome promiſe would bee made, by the new King, preiudiciall to the Popes authoritie. But the Emperour, and the King vſed much arte to diuert the handling of points of Religion before the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which was made the 24 of Nouember, and the coronation the laſt <note place="margin">The election of the King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</note> of that moneth.

at the <hi>Maſſe</hi> vntill the Goſpell was read, and then they went foorth. This onely was new. But the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> tooke place aboue the Electours and Ambaſſadours. The coronation being paſt, the Emperour beganne to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe with ſome of the Proteſtants, that they would adhere to the Councell of <hi>Trent;</hi> who, not to bee preuented, aſſembling themſelues together, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Emperour the anſwere, promiſed 20. moneths before to his Ambaſſadours, in the aſſembly at <hi>Namburg,</hi> which was deferred vntill then. <note place="margin">Conditions required by the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of <hi>Germany,</hi> before they would aſſiſt the, Councel.</note> In which hauing declared the cauſes why they had, inmany Imperiall Diets, appealed and did appeale againe vnto a free Councell, they added the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they held to bee neceſſary, with which they offeredto aſſiſt in a future generall Councel. 1. That it ſhould bee celebrated in <hi>Germanie.</hi> 2. That it ſhould not bee intimated by the Pope. 3. That hee ſhould not preſide, but bee part of the Councel, ſubiect to the determinations thereof. 4. That the Biſhops and other Prelates ſhould bee freed from their oath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Pope, that they may freely, and without impediment, deliuer their opinions. 5. That the holy Scripture might bee iudge in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and all humaine authority excluded. 6. That the Diuines of the States of the <hi>Auguſtan Confeſsion,</hi> ſent to the Councel, might not onely haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting, but deciding voice alſo, and might haue a Safe-conduct, both for their perſones, and for the exerciſe of their religion. 7. That the deciſions in Councel, ſhould not be made, as in Secular matters, by pluralitie of voices, but the more ſound opinions preferred, that is, thoſe which were regulated by the word of God. 8. That the acts of the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould bee made void, becauſe it is partiall, celebrated by one part onely, and not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned according to promiſe. 9. That if a concord in religion cannot be concluded in the Councel, the conditions of <hi>Paſſau</hi> may remaine inuiolable, as alſo the peace of religion, made in <hi>Ausburg,</hi> in the yeere 1555. may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſtrength and force, and euery one bound toobſerue it. 10. That, concerning the foreſaid conditions, a fit and ſufficient caution be giuen. The Emperour, hauing receiued the writing, promiſed to labour for concord, and to vſe meanes that the Councell may be celebrated, where they cannot refuſe, with reaſon, to aſſiſt, ſo that on their part they would lay aſide hatred and paſſion, which are contrary to Chriſtian peace. And, to this end, hee offered to goe in perſon to <hi>Trent,</hi> and reſolued to paſſe to <hi>Iſpruc,</hi> ſo ſoone as the Diet was ended, where beeing diſtant from <hi>Trent</hi> but foure ſmall dayes iourney, he might in a ſhort time effect whatſoeuer was neceſſary.</p>
            <p>But in Councell the Prelats hauing made an end of giuing voyces concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Inſtitution, ſo much diſcuſſed: no reſolution was made, becauſe the Legates did expect it from <hi>Rome:</hi> But they gaue foorth the Canon of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, hauing firſt imparted it to the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> which was, as was ſayd before, without the declaration whether it was <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> or no, but with rewards and penalties. And <hi>Loraine,</hi> giuing his voyce firſt, ſaid it was neceſſary to grant power to the Biſhops to abſolue from caſes reſerued <hi>In caena Domini:</hi> which he proteſted hee ſpake, not to diminiſh the authoritie of his Holineſſe, but becauſe, hauing ſeene in <hi>France</hi> that no tranſgreſſour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of did care to goe or ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> for abſolution, he thought it worſe, both for the ſoules of the people, and for the dignitie of the Apoſtolique Sea, to
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:17208:331"/>
leaue them in thoſe cenſures. Hee added alſo that hee thought it not fit ſo to tye Biſhops to reſidence, that they might not bee abſent for iuſt cauſes, which were to be referred to the iudgment of his Holyneſſe. Hee ſaid moreouer, that the publike emploiments in the affaires of Kingdomes, and republikes, were to bee accepted, becauſe they ſeeme not to be aliene from the Epiſcopal charge, eſpecially in Kingdomes, where the Eccleſiaſticall order is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the State, as in <hi>France,</hi> and the Kingdomes, of <hi>Spaine</hi> alſo. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall was very prolixe; and howſoeuer he repeted often that Reſidence was neceſſary, and that it was fit to make prouiſion for it, yet hee interpoſed ſo many exceptions, and excuſes, that, in the end, no man could iudge whether he would haue any conſtitution to be made for it or no.</p>
            <p>The Legates imparted the Articles of reformation for the future Seſſion to the Ambaſſadors alſo, according to promiſe, before they were propoſed in Congregation; which were all for remedies of the abuſes in the Sacrament of <hi>Order.</hi> And therefore the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours and Biſhops met in the houſe of <hi>Loraine,</hi> to conſider of them, and deputed foure Biſhops to examine whether any thing was contained in them preiudiciall to the priuiledges of the <hi>French</hi> Church, or whether any thing might bee added for the ſeruice of their Countrey, and withall they gaue order to the Ambaſſadour <hi>de Ferrieres,</hi> to collect, in Congregation of the ſame Biſhops, all the reformations, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly propoſed in <hi>Trent,</hi> vnder <hi>Paulus,</hi> and <hi>Iulius,</hi> and in the preſent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell alſo, and in the Congregation of <hi>Poiſi,</hi> to make an abſtract of them, and, adding vnto them thoſe which were contained in the Kings inſtructions, and whatſoeuer ſeemed good vnto them beſides, ſhould compoſe Articles for all Chriſtendome, and <hi>France</hi> eſpecially.</p>
            <p>But the Imperialiſts, ſeeing that none of the Reformations mentioned by them were propoſed, called together all the Ambaſſadors. <hi>Prague</hi> ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and told them, that much time was conſumed in Councell with doing of nothing; that the Legates had often promiſed to handle Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet they were entertained with ſpeculations, or with prouiſions a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt ſmall abuſes; that it was time to make an effectuall inſtance that they would begin to handle important and vrgent matters, and that if all would ioyne in requeſting the execution of ſo many promiſes, made by the Pope and the Legates, there might be hope to obtaine. All conſented; but when they came to particulars, they were ſo different, that they could not agree but in the generall, onely to demand a Reformation. Whereupon it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, that <hi>Prague,</hi> in deliuering his voyce, ſhould deſire it, in the name of all; and ſo he did.</p>
            <p>And, in the matter of reſidence, he ſaid in few words, that the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being taken from the Prelates, which they enioy in the Courts of <hi>Rome</hi> and other Princes, any Decree would ſuffice. The opinion of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Otranto</hi> was, that the Decree of the ſaid Councell vnder <hi>Paul</hi> the third was ſufficient, adding onely the Popes Bull, dated the fourth of <hi>Sept.</hi> 1560. Others demanded that the cauſes of abſence, which the Synode deemeth to be lawfull, ſhould be expreſſed, becauſe the greateſt difficultie is like to ariſe vpon this point. The Bull, named by <hi>Otranto,</hi> did containe a command of perſonall reſidence, vnder the penalties, declared by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:17208:332"/>
and foure graces to thoſe which reſide. That is, that they may not be cited to the Court, but with Commiſſion ſigned by the Pope. That they ſhall be free from all impoſitions, ordinary and extraordinary, though impoſed at the petition of Princes. That they may exerciſe iuriſdiction againſt euery Secular Clerke, or Regular, dwelling out of his Cloyſter. That no appeale may lye from their ſentences, but onely from the definitiue. Others were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Decree; as it was porpoſed by the Legates, but with ſome alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, all fit for their owne reſpects, which were as many as there were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Some required that the declaration <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> might be made. And there was a fourth opinion, that although it be <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> yet it was not fit to make declaration thereof.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> aſſembled the <hi>French</hi> Prelates to diſpute vpon this poynt; who concluded vniformely, that it was <hi>de iure diuino.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Angiu,</hi> was the firſt that gaue his opinion ſo, and all the reſt did follow him. But in the generall Congregation of the Synode, the Prelates were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakeably tedious; whereof the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> complained to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, deſiring to haue thoſe matters diſpatched, that they might come to the reformation, repeating the words ſo often vſed, that if ſatisfaction be not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them in <hi>Trent</hi> they will take it at home.</p>
            <p>Frier <hi>Albertus Duimius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Veglia,</hi> alledging that the point of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <note place="margin">The ſuffrage of the Biſhop of <hi>Veglia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</note> was diſcuſſed in the Councell vnder <hi>Paul</hi> the third, and the deciſion deferred vntill another time, ſaid, that therefore it was neceſſary to ſee the reaſons then alledged by the Prelates; that now they had giuen their voyces without alledging reaſons, which himſelfe would not doe, eſteeming rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more then authoritie and multitude of opinions. And then he began to recite all the reaſons for proofe that it is <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> and to reſolue the contrary. He inſiſteth much vpon the ſaying of CHRIST, <hi>A good ſhepheard go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before the flocke, calleth euery ſheepe by name, runneth through the deſert to ſeeke that which is loſt, and layeth downe his life for them.</hi> He ſheweth that this was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of all thoſe whom CHRIST hath inſtituted <hi>Pastors;</hi> which are all thoſe who haue cure of ſoules, eſpecially the Biſhops, as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaid and wrote to the <hi>Epheſians;</hi> that whoſoeuer did hold himſelfe not to be bound by the Decree of CHRIST to performe theſe offices, or was more fit for the affaires of Kingdomes, or Common-wealths, ought to leaue the charge of a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> and apply himſelfe to thoſe matters onely; that it is very much to performe one charge well, but to performe two, which be contrary, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. His prolixitie did not pleaſe the Cardinals, becauſe he was the firſt that diſputed that matter with reaſon. Hee ſpake with great vehemencie, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing many phraſes and words, taken out of Saint <hi>Hierome. Simoneta</hi> would willingly haue interrupted him, but forbare, in regard of the occurrence of the Biſhop of <hi>Guadice.</hi> But hee called him, in the preſence of many Prelats, and reprehended him ſharpely for ſpeaking againſt the Pope. The Biſhop defended himſelfe humbly, and with reaſons: and a few dayes after, alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indiſpoſition, asked leaue to depart, and had it, and departed the one <note place="margin">Who quieteth <hi>Trent</hi> for feare.</note> and twentieth of the moneth.</p>
            <p>After this time the controuerſie about reſidence changed ſtate, and thoſe <note place="margin">The Prelats are terrified with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes authority.</note> who did abhorre it, did labour no more to demonſtrate by reaſons or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:17208:332"/>
as vntill then they had done, that it was of the law of man, but began to terrifie thoſe of the contrary opinion, by ſaying, that to maintaine that it was <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> was to diminiſh the Popes authority; becauſe it would follow that hee could not enlarge or diminiſh, diuide or vnite, change or transferre Epiſcopall Seas, nor leaue them vacant, or gaue them an adminiſtration, or <hi>commenda;</hi> that hee could not reſtraine, much leſſe take away the authoritie to abſolue; that, by this determination, all diſpenſations granted by Popes, were condemned at once, and power taken away to grant them hereafter. The other part, who ſaw the neceſſitie of thoſe conſequences, which they thought were not vnfit, but that it was the trueth, and the lawfull vſe of the ancient Church, and that the declaration was propoſed for no other ende then to remooue thoſe inconueniences, themſelues alſo omitting to vſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and authority, to prooue it to bee <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> began to ſhew, that reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence beeing reſtored by that declaration, it would turne to the inlargement of the Popes power, and encreaſe the reuerence towards the Clergie, and eſpecially towards the Pope, who hath loſt authority in ſo many Prouinces, becauſe Biſhops, not reſiding, but gouerning by vnable Vicars, haue left a way open for the ſowing of new doctrines, which, with ſo much detriment of the Popes authoritie, haue taken roote. If Biſhops doe reſide, his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie will be preached euery where, and confirmed where it is acknowledged as yet, and reſtored where it hath been ſhaken. Neither of the parties could ſpeake with ſuch termes, but that their diſſimulation was perceiued on both ſides, and their inward thoughts, which they would haue concealed, were but too manifeſt. They were all masked, and yet all knowen. Being aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled againe the ſixteenth of December, one halfe of the Prelates hauing not as yet giuen their voyces, Cardinall <hi>Seripando</hi> propoſed the prorogation of the Seſſion; and beeing not able then to foreſee when they could diſpatch, they reſolued to prefixe a certaine time, within fifteene dayes. And the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal admoniſhed the Prelats of their great prolixitie, in giuing their voyces, which did ayme only at oſtentation, tooke away the reputation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and did prolong it, to the great in commoditie of them all.</p>
            <p>The Pope was much afflicted with the death of <hi>Fredericke Boromeo</hi> his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, which happened in the end of the laſt moneth; vpon whom thinking to conferre all the greatneſſe of his houſe, hee had married him to a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Duke of <hi>Vrbin,</hi> made him generall gouernour of the Church, and purpoſed alſo to giue him the Dukedome of <hi>Camerino,</hi> and becauſe hee was old, and oppreſſed with griefe, hee fell into a dangerous ſickneſſe; out of which beeing recouered, hee applyed his minde to the affaires of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. Hee held diuers Congregations, to finde a temper concerning the two Canons, of the Inſtitution, and of Reſidence, which were thought by all the Court to bee very dangerous for the Popes authoritie; as alſo to make ſome prouiſion againſt the prolixitie of the Prelats, in deliuering their opinions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it did prolong the Councell, and left a gate open for all thoſe to enter, who would attempt any thing againſt his dignitie. Aboue all, that which was deſſeigned by the Frenchmen did trouble him, eſpecially, becauſe hee did neuer receiue Letters from <hi>Trent;</hi> in which it was not ſayd, that either the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> or ſome of the Ambaſſadours did make requeſt for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:17208:333"/>
with this addition, that if they could not obtaine thoſe prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they demanded, they would make them at home, making mention often of prouiding againſt the <hi>annats, preuentions,</hi> and other things properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi> He reſolued to deale plainely with the French-men; and to thoſe which were in <hi>Rome</hi> he ſayd, that, hauing ſo often offered to treat with the King concerning his owne rights, and to come to a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compoſition, and ſeeing that his miniſters in the Councell doe alwayes make ſhew that they will ſpeake of them in the Synode, hee was reſolute to ſee whether hee would breake out into an open diſſention with him. Hee gaue order, by an expreſſe currier, to his <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>France</hi> to ſpeake hereof; and wrote to the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> that thoſe matters could not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Councell, without breach of the Kings promiſes, expreſſely made vnto him, by <hi>Monſieur d' Auxerres.</hi> Hee complained in Conſiſtory of the impertinencie of the Biſhops in <hi>Trent,</hi> in making euery thing long, to no purpoſe. Hee exhorted the Cardinals to write to their friends, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wrote to the Legats, to vſe threats and authoritie, ſeeing that perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did no good. Concerning the Articles of the Inſtitution he wrote, that to make the inſtitution of Biſhops abſolutely <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> was a falſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and erroneous; becauſe the power of <hi>Order</hi> was from CHRIST, but of iuriſdiction from the Pope, which, in this reſpect, may bee ſaid to be from CHRIST, becauſe the Papall authoritie commeth from his Diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, ſo that whatſoeuer the Pope doeth, CHRIST doeth by him. And, for a reſolution, hee wrote, that either the words <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> ſhould bee quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or they ſhould be vſed in that forme which hee ſent, in which it was ſayd that CHRIST did inſtitute Biſhops to be created by the Pope, who may diſtribute to them what and how much authority it pleaſed him to giue them, for the benefit of the Church, hauing abſolute power to reſtraine and amplifie that which is giuen, as ſeemeth good vnto him. Then hee wrote, that, in the particular of Reſidence, it being a cleere caſe that the Pope hath power to diſpenſe, they ſhould, by all good caution of words, reſerue his authoritie in the Decree, in which the words <hi>de iure Diuino,</hi> could by no meanes bee put; as <hi>Catharinus</hi> had well prooued, from whoſe opinion, beeing Catholique, they ought not to depart. For holding the Seſſion, hee wrote confuſedly, that it ſhould not bee deferred aboue fifteene dayes, nor celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the matter were in order, that the enuious might not take occaſion to calumniate.</p>

And all the Fathers were in a hurly burly, becauſe letters came from <hi>Rome</hi> to diuers Prelates, that the Councell ſhould be ſuſpended, which report was confirmed by <hi>Don Iohn Manriques</hi> who paſſed by <hi>Trent,</hi> from <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> But the Legats, hauing receiued the Popes letters, thought it impoſſible to execute the orders

Each of them departing from his houſe, to goe towards <hi>Paris,</hi> and in the iourney ſlaying and diſperſing the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> whom they found aſſembled in diuers places, they entred into <hi>Paris;</hi> and, hauing drawen the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> to their ſide, and cauſed the city to arme in their fauour, the Queene was conſtrained to ioyne with them.

The Princes letters were accompanied with others of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and of ſome other cities, which cauſed thoſe of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to arme.

Hee told them that this was the ſixe and twentieth yeere ſince <hi>Paul</hi> the third began to heale this diſeaſe, by intimating the Councell there; which was firſt deferred, then diſſembled, and finally cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated with diuers factions, vntill it was transferred to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> where there were many dilations, and greater contentions, and more bitter factions then before. Afterwards it was recalled to <hi>Trent,</hi> and, by reaſon of the warres diſſolued. Now that they were come to the laſt, there was no more place for diſſimulation, becauſe the Councell would either reconcile the whole world, or caſt it headlong into an infallible ruine. Therefore it was fit that the Fathers ſhould not regard their priuate intereſts, nor haue particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, nor ſpeake in fauour of others, in regard the cauſe of religion was in queſtion, which will be vtterly ouerthrowne, if they caſt their eye vpon any thing beſides. This libertie of ſpeach hee tempered with flatterie, firſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pope, then towards the Emperour, kings of the Romanes, and of <hi>Polonia.</hi> He paſſed to the commendations of the Queene Mother of <hi>France,</hi> and of the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and, in the end, exhorted them to reforme the Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> hauing receiued newes of the impriſonment of the Prince; was very glad, particularly for the honour of his brother, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the more to returne quickly into <hi>France,</hi> to aſſiſt him in the Court and in the Kings Councell, and to raiſe himſelfe alſo one degree higher, in regard <hi>Nauar</hi> and the Conſtable, to whom hee was necceſſarily to yeeld, were both taken away.</p>

            <p>The Courtiers in <hi>Rome</hi> thinking the Catholikes in <hi>France</hi> had gotten an abſolute victorie, and that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> were reduced to nothing, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad. For beleeuing that <hi>France</hi> had obtained that by Armes which it expected from the Synode, and there being no further regard to bee had of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which proteſted againſt it, they thought that all cauſes of holding the Councel were ceaſed, ſo that it might be ſuſpended or deferred, and them ſelues deliuered from feare, which had increaſed euery weeke, by reaſon of the nouities which happened in <hi>Trent.</hi> But the Pope made no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it. For being informed that the Catholike forces were not augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor the <hi>Hugonots</hi> diminiſhed, and that this battell would giue occaſion to treate a peace, which could not bee without his preiudice, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giuing matter of more nouities in <hi>Trent,</hi> hee was more afraide and troubled then before. And the yeere 1562. ended thus; a congregation in <hi>Trent</hi> hauing beene helde the thirtieth of the moneth, in which it was reſolued to prolong the Seſſion, and appoint a day for it within fifteene dayes.</p>
            <p>The yeere 1563. began in Councell with the preſentation of the articles, of reformation made by the French Ambaſſadours, which ſeemed very hard to the Legates and all the Papalins; eſpecially in thoſe particulars in which <note place="margin">1563 The Articles of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> they would haue the <hi>Rites</hi> of the Roman Church altered, and in which the emoluments and profits, which the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea</hi> receiued from other Churches, were touched. The Ambaſſadors added the vſuall <hi>Appendix,</hi> not to call it a proteſtation, that if their propoſitions were not imbraced, they would prouide for their neceſſities in <hi>France.</hi> The Legates were ſure the Pope would bee vexed heerewith, in regard of the promiſe made vnto him, that they would not treat in Councell of the <hi>Annats,</hi> and other pecum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie <hi>Rites;</hi> but friendly compoſe the matter with him. Therefore they thought it neceſſarie to ſend them to him by a Prelate, and to informe <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Viterbois</hi> ſent to the Pope.</note> his Holineſſe. And they elected the Biſhop of <hi>Viterbo,</hi> as being well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the affaires of <hi>France,</hi> where hee had beene <hi>Nuncio</hi> many yeeres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and in the deſignes of the Cardinall and French Prelates of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, with whom hee had conuerſed ſince their arriuall. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> informed heereof, perſwaded them to doe ſo,
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:17208:335"/>
and himſelfe gaue him inſtructions, to ſpeake with the Pope. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was ſo nimble, that howſoeuer the Cardinall held that hee was ſent vnto him for a ſpie, and an obſeruer, yet hee carried himſelfe ſo well, that he gained the confidence of him and the Ambaſſadours, without loſing that which the Pope and Legates had in him. The Prelate went with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to repreſent to the Pope all the difficulties which the Legats found, and to bring backe a reſolution how they ſhould gouerne themſelues in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular. Hee had inſtructions from <hi>Loraine</hi> to deſire his Holineſſe to take in good part that which was deſired by the King for the neceſſitie of his Kingdome, and by them to execute the commands of his Maieſtie, and to offer his endeuours to accommodate the differences of the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhops, and of reſidence, which held the Councell employed in ſmall matters.</p>
            <p>The Emperours miniſters, ſeeing the Reformation of the Frenchmen, and conſidering the Proheme, thought they were noted to haue but ſmall authoritie. They complained to the Legates that the Articles of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mentioned by the Emperour and by them, had not been propoſed, though they had giuen copies of them, ſent them to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſpread them throughout <hi>Trent;</hi> deſiring they may bee put together with thoſe of the Frenchmen. The Legats excuſed themſelues, in regard of the libertie which the Emperour by letters, and themſelues by word of mouth had giuen them, to propoſe and omit what ſeemed them good, adding, that they did expect a fit time, and that indeede the Frenchmen had not found a good conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, while the differences of the two Canons doth continue, which giueth much trouble to his Holineſſe. The Amdaſſadours were not ſo ſatisfied, ſaying, there was a great difference betweene omitting all, and a part; and betweene deferring, whiles in the meane ſpace things are concealed with due reſpect, and diuulging them, and putting them in deriſion. And <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta</hi> replyed, that it was hard to diſcerne which were fit to bee propoſed, but eaſie to know which were to bee omitted, in the end they were content to expect what the Pope would ſay to the French propoſitions, ſo that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theirs might bee propoſed. The French Prelates had conſented, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall termes, to the Articles belonging to <hi>Rites,</hi> and to the grieuances of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, which in their ſecret thoughts they did not approoue, becauſe they beleeued that, in the diſcuſſion of them, they ſhould haue the Spaniards, and many of the Italians their oppoſites; but ſeeing they were ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> they were afraid that the Pope oppoſing thoſe which touched his reuenues; would yeeld to the others, and by compoſition be content to giue way to thoſe which were preiudiciall to them, to auoyde others which concerned his owne intereſt. For this cauſe they made ſecret practiſes with the other Prelats, perſwading a moderation; which being done after the French fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, without much caution, was knowne to the Ambaſſadours. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lanſac</hi> aſſembled them all, and reprehended them ſharpely, for daring to oppoſe the will of the King, Queene, of the whole councell, and of the Kingdome. Hee exhorted them, not onely not to labour againſt, but to promote the Kings determination. And the admonition was very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous.</p>

But before wee relate the negotiation in <hi>Rome,</hi> it will not bee amiſſe to declare the ſubſtance of the French propoſition, which preſently was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Ripa</hi> and <hi>Padua,</hi> and conteined: That the Ambaſſadours had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined long ſince, in performance of the Kings command, to propoſe to the Councell the things conteined in that writing; but the Emperour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing propoſed almoſt the ſame things, not to importune the Fathers, they had expected to ſee what the Pope would reſolue concerning the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Imperiall Maieſtie. Now hauing receiued a new commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the King, and ſeeing the inſtance of the Emperour deſerred lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then they thought, they reſolued not to make any more delay, not deſiring any thing ſingular, or ſeparate from the reſidue of Chriſtendome; and that the King, expecting that eſteeme ſhould bee held of his propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, doth notwithſtanding referre the iudgement and knowledge of them all to the fathers. The points were foure and thirtie. 1. That Prieſts <note place="margin">The French propſitions.</note> ſhould not bee ordained before they were old, and had a good teſtimonie of the people, that they had liued well, and that their carnalities and tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould bee puniſhed according to the Canons. 2. That holy <hi>Orders</hi> ſhould not bee conferred at the ſame time when the inferiour were, but that euery one ſhould bee approoued in theſe, before hee aſcended to thoſe. 3. That a Prieſt ſhould not bee ordained, before hee had a Benefice, or miniſterie, according to the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> at which time a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterall title without an Office was not heard of. 4. That the due fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould bee reſtored to Deacons, and other holy Orders, that they may not ſeeme to bee bare names, and for ceremonie only. 5. That the Prieſts and other Eccleſiaſticall Miniſters ſhould attend to their vocation, not medling in any office, but in the diuine miniſtery. 6. That a Biſhop ſhould not be made but of a lawfull age, manners, and doctrine, that hee may teach, and giue example to the people. 7. That no Pariſh Prieſt ſhould bee made but of approued honeſtie, able to inſtruct the people, celebrate the ſacrifice, adminiſter the Sacrament, and teach the vſe and effect of them to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. 8. That no Abbat or Conuentual Prior ſhould bee created, who hath not ſtudied diuinity in ſome famous Vniuerſity, and obtained the degree of Maſter, or ſome other. 9. That the Biſhop, by himſelfe, or by other prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, as many as are ſufficient, according to the proportion of the Dioceſſe, ſhould preach euery Sunday and Holyday, &amp; in Lent, on faſting dayes, and in Aduent, and as often as it ſhall bee fit. 10. That the pariſh Prieſt ſhould doe the ſame as often as hee hath auditors. 11. That the Abbat and Conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Prior ſhall reade the holy Scripture, and inſtitute an Hoſpitall, ſo that the ancient Schooles and hoſpitality may bee reſtored to the Monaſteries. 12. That Biſhops, Pariſh Prieſts, Abbats, and other Eccleſiaſtiques, vnable to performe their charge, ſhall receiue <hi>Coadiutors,</hi> or leaue their Benefices. 13. That concerning the Catechiſme, and ſummarie inſtruction of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrine, that ſhould be ordayned which the Emperour hath propoſed to the Councell. 14. That no man ſhould haue more then one benefice, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the differences of the quality of perſons, and of Benefices compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and incompatible, a new diuiſion not heard of in the ancient Decrees, and a cauſe of many troubles in the Catholique Church; and that the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

That the ancient Decree of <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> for the Communion vnder both kinds, bee renewed. 19. That before the adminiſtration of euery Sacrament, an expoſition bee made in the vulgar, ſo that the ignorant may vnderſtand their vſe and efficacie. 20. That according to the ancient Canons, benefices may not bee conferred by the Vicars, but by the Biſhops themſelues, within the terme of ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, otherwiſe that the collation may bee deuolued to the next Superiour, and, by degrees to the Pope. 21.

That ſimple Priories, from which the cure of ſoules is taken away, contrary to the foundation, and aſſigned to a perpetuall Vicar, with a ſmall portion of tithes, or of other renenue, bee reſtored to their former ſtate at the firſt vacancie. 24. That benefices, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which no office of preaching, adminiſtring the Sacraments, nor any other Eccleſiaſticall charge is annexed, may haue ſome ſpirituall cure impoſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, by the Biſhop, with the councell of the chapter, or bee vnited to the next pariſhes, becauſe no Benefice ought or can bee without an office. 25. That penſions bee not impoſed vpon benefices, and thoſe aboliſhed which are impoſed already, that the Eccleſiaſticall reuenues may bee ſpent in maintaining the Paſtors, and poore, and in other workes of pietie. 26. That Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction throughout the whole Dioceſſe be reſtored to the Biſhops, all exemptions being taken away, but of the chiefe gouernors of the Orders and Monaſteries ſubiect vnto them, and thoſe who make generall Chapters, to whom exemptions are granted by a lawfull title, but yet with prouiſion that they bee not exempted from correction. 27. That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop may not vſe iuriſdiction, and handle matters of great weight concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Dioceſſe, without the counſell of the Chapter; and that the Canons may reſide continually in the Churches, bee of good conuerſation, learned, and at the leaſt 25. yeeres of age, in regard the lawes, not giuing them the

            <p>The firſt of Ianuarie <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> arriued in <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing made the iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <note place="margin">The negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Biſhop of <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi>

Hee preſented the letters to the Pope, and declared his credence, relating the cogitations and diuers ends and humours which were in the Councell, and in what ſort the Legates and other good ſeruants of his Holineſſe thought the difficulties ought to bee managed. The Pope held a congregation the third day, and gaue account of the relation of <hi>Vintimiglia,</hi> ſhewed he was ſatisfied with the diligence and wiſdome of the Legates, and commended the good will of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and gaue order that they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult vpon the point of the inſtitution of Biſhops, which did then eſpecially preſſe them. The ſixth day beeing the <hi>anniuerſarie</hi> of his coronation, hee held another Congregation, in whch hee publiſhed Cardinals <hi>Ferdinando de Medici,</hi> and <hi>Frederico Gonzaga;</hi> the former to conſolate his father for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable death of another ſonne, who was Cardinall alſo, and the other to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Legate <hi>Mantue,</hi> and others of the family neerely allied to him by a marriage of the Legates nephew to a ſiſter of Cardinall <hi>Borromeo.</hi> Yet the Pope did not omit to aſſiſt at the Conſultation concerning the affaires of the Councell, and reſolued to write to the Legates, that the Canon of the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Biſhops ſhould be thus compoſed: That the Biſhops doe hold the

principall place in the Church, depending of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that they are by him aſſumed, <hi>in partem ſolicitudinis.</hi> And in the Canon concerning the Popes power, that it ſhould be ſaid; that he hath authority to feede and gouerne the Vniuerſall Church, in place of Chriſt, from whom all authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath beene communicated to him, as Generall Vicar: but in the Decree of doctrine they ſhould enlarge the words of the Councell of <hi>Florence;</hi> which are, that the holy Apoſtolike Sea, and Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> hath the Primacie in all <note place="margin">The Popes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

For the ſubſtance of it beeing taken out of a generall Councell, hee that ſhould oppoſe, would ſhew himſelfe to bee a Schiſmatike, and fall into the cenſures, which, by the prouidence of God, hauing alwayes beene inflicted vpon the contumacious, with the greater exaltation of the Apoſtolique Sea, hee was confident that the cauſe of the Church would not bee abandoned by the Diuine Maieſtie, nor by the good Catholiques; and he hoped that in the meane ſpace <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> would be returned, whom he meant to diſpatch ſhortly, with more ample inſtructions. Hee reſolued to goe to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> that he might bee neere, and ſo the better imbrace all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of finiſhing or tranſlating the Councell, which, before they could bee aduiſed to <hi>Rome,</hi> did vaniſh.

            <p>In the end of the moneth, he deliuered in Conſiſtory, that the greateſt Princes of Chriſtendome did demand reformation, which could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied them, neither by true reaſons, nor by pretences: and therefore that hee was reſolued to giue a good example, and, not to faile of his duetie, to begin with himſelfe, prouiding againſt the abuſes of the <hi>Datary,</hi> taking away the <hi>coadiutories, regreſſes, reſignations</hi> in fauour, and that the Cardinals ought not onely to conſent vnto it, but to publiſh it to all.

Afterwards the Pope related how many enterpriſes were vſed in Councell againſt the priuiledges of the Romane Church, and ſpake of <hi>Annats, Reſeruations,</hi> and <hi>preuentions.</hi> He ſaid they were neceſſarie Subſidies, to maintaine the Pope, and Colledge of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, whereof as themſelues were partakers, ſo it was fit they ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to defend them, and that hee would ſend a number of them to <hi>Trent,</hi> for this ſeruice.</p>
            <p>In which place, the next day after the arriuall of the currier, who brought <note place="margin">The Canons ſent from <hi>Rome.</hi>

this word, Church Vniuerſall, was vſed in the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth, in condemning the Articles of <hi>Iohn Wiglef,</hi> doth condemne the Article againſt the ſupremacy of the Apoſtolique Sea, onely for ſaying, that it is not ſet ouer all particular Churches. And here a diſputation began betweene the Frenchmen and the Italians, theſe ſaying that the Councell of <hi>Florence</hi> was generall, that of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> partly approoued, and partly not, and that other of <hi>Baſil</hi> ſchiſmaticall; <note place="margin">A difference between the Italians and the French-men about the Councels of <hi>Conſtance, Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi>
               </note> and the others maintaining that thoſe of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> were generall Councels, and that this name could not agree to that of <hi>Florence,</hi> celebrated onely by ſome few Italians, and foure Grecians. Neither did they grant that the Pope had all the authoritie from CHRIST, no not with the reſtrictions and limitations, as he was a man, and in the time of his mortalitie; but they were content it ſhould bee ſaid that hee had authoritie equall to that of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> This manner of ſpeech was ſuſpected by the Papalins, who ſaw they would make the life and actions of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> a paterne for the Pope, which would, as they ſaid, reduce the Apoſtolique Sea to nothing; which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended to haue an vnlimited power, to be able to giue a rule for all emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents as the times doe require, though contrary to the actions of all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours, and of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe. And the contentions were like to proceed further. But the Legats, to giue ſome intermiſſion, to haue time to ſend the Pope the corrections of the <hi>Vltramontans,</hi> and receiue his command how to gouerne themſelues in the buſineſſe, that they might ſet another matter on foot which might make this to be forgotten, returned to the point of Reſidence, concerning which, <hi>Loraine</hi> and <hi>Madruccio</hi> had compoſed a forme, and preſented it ſome dayes before to the Legats, who without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering of it, did approoue it, vpon the firſt ſight. Afterward, hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with the Canoniſts, they diſliked one parte, in which it was ſaid, that Biſhops are bound by the commandement of God, to attend and watch ouer the flocke, perſonally; and doubting that thoſe words would not pleaſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> they changed them, and ſo propoſed the forme in congregation. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> &amp; <hi>Trent</hi> are offended with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats.</note> and <hi>Madruccio</hi> were much offended with this mutation, and thought they were diſparaged: and <hi>Loraine</hi> ſaid, that hereafter he would take no more care in thoſe things, nor treat with the Prelats, but onely giue his voice with modeſtie, and ſerue the Legats out of his loue, in any honeſt worke, as farre as he was able. And <hi>Madruccio</hi> did not forbeare to ſay, that there was a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Councell within the Councell, which did arrogate more authoritie. <note place="margin">A Councell within the Councell</note> The Legates perceiuing that euery thing turned againſt them, cauſed the Congregations to be omitted, Neither was this ſufficient.

The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Otranto,</hi> and others, who aimed at the Cardinalitie, of which they thought themſelues aſſured if the Councell were ſeparated, agreed together to oppoſe euery thing to make ſome tumult ariſe, and went paſſionately about, euen in the night alſo, making practiſes, and cauſing men to ſet their hand to papers. Which, though in effect, it pleaſed the Legats, yet, for the manner, it diſpleaſed the moſt of them, as beeing of bad example, which might giue ſcandall. And, on the contrary ſide, there wanted not thoſe who deſired a diſſolution. But each partie expected an
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:17208:339"/>
occaſion that the cauſe of it might be attributed to the other: ſo that the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions did encreaſe on both ſides.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> complained to all, that plots were laid to diſſolue the Synod, and eſpecially to the Ambaſſadours of Princes, deſiring them to write to their Maſters, to perſwade the Pope that the Councell may bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, that the practiſes might bee moderated, and the Fathers left to their libertie; ſaying, that otherwiſe a compoſition would bee made in <hi>France,</hi> that <note place="margin">Of which the Card of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth.</note> euery one might liue as hee would vntill a free Councell, as this was not, in which nothing could be reſolued but as pleaſed the Legates, nor by the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, but as the Pope liſted; that he would be patient vntill the next Seſſion, <note place="margin">And of the want of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</note> and then, if he ſawe not things goe better, hee would make his proteſtations, and, together with the Ambaſſadours and Prelates, returne into <hi>France,</hi> to make a Nationall Councel, in which perhaps <hi>Germanie</hi> would concurre with them; a thing which would be diſpleaſing vnto himſelfe, in regerd of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that the Apoſtolique Sea would not bee acknowledged any more. In thoſe dayes many Curriers paſſed betweene <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Trent.</hi> For the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates <note place="margin">As did alſo the French-men in <hi>Rome</hi>
               </note> aduiſed the frequent contradictions, and the Pope ſollicited the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Canons which he ſent. And the French-men in <hi>Rome</hi> made the ſame complaint to the Pope, which <hi>Loraine</hi> had done in <hi>Trent,</hi> and vſed the ſame threats of a Nationall Councell, and the aſſiſtance of <hi>Germanie.</hi> But <note place="margin">The Pope an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely.</note> the Pope, who had been vſed to theſe things, ſaid hee was not daunted with words, was not afraid of Nationall Synods, did knowe that the French Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were Catholiques, and that <hi>Germanie</hi> would not ſubiect it ſelfe to their Councels. He ſaid that the Councell was not onely free, but might be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led licentious; that the practiſes of the Italians in <hi>Trent</hi> were not with his knowledge, but did ariſe becauſe the <hi>Vltramontans</hi> would tread the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie vnder their feete; that hee hath had three good occaſions to diſſolue the Councell, but was willing it ſhould continue, hoping that GOD would not abandon his Church, and that euery attempt againſt it would come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of the Innouators. <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> departed, and went to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Court, in the time of theſe confuſions, to giue his Maieſtie an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſtate of the Councel, and of the combination of the Italian Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates; and it was diſcouered that <hi>Granata,</hi> and his adherents, had deſired him to perſwade the Emperour to write to the Catholique King concerning the Reformation and Reſidence, that both in thoſe, and in other occaſions they might ſpeake freely, according to their conſcience; all which the Legates did beleeue to proceede from <hi>Loraine.</hi> And therefore, for a counterpoiſe, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues alſo, a few dayes after, ſent the Biſhop <hi>Commendone</hi> to the Emperour, vpon pretence to excuſe, and render the cauſes why the demands of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty could not as yet be propoſed.

Councell, and to relate them to him. All theſe things made the Legates doubt that the Councell would be diſſolued, in ſome manner diſhonourable to the Pope, and themſelues, obſeruing that it was deſired by many, euen by ſome of the Papalins themſelues, and that diſorders were purpoſely procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by others, to iuſtifie themſelues, in caſe it ſhould happen. They ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Ambaſſadours a writing, which conteined the preſent difficulties, and deſired their counſell. But the French Ambaſſadours anſwered, vpon this occaſion, that which they deſired to ſay many dayes before; that as the Councell was aſſembled to remedie abuſes, ſo ſome were willing to make vſe <note place="margin">A free ſpeech vſed by the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours.</note> of it to encreaſe them; that before any thing elſe were done, it was fit to withſtand ſuch manifeſt practiſes; that they were intolerable; that if they were remoued, and euery man had libertie to ſpeake freely what hee thought a good accord would eaſily bee made; that the Pope was Head of the Church, but not aboue it; that he was to gouerne and direct the other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but not to domineere ouer the body; that to remedie the differences, it was neceſſary to follow the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which hauing found the Church moſt diſorderly by meanes of theſe opinions, did reduce it into tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable tearmes. They ſayd that one cauſe of diſcord was, becauſe the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <note place="margin">Seconded by the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts.</note> did not ſet downe their voyces faithfully, ſo that the greater part ſeemed in the acts to be the leſſer, and that could not be taken for a reſolution which was concluded by the common opinion; and therefore that it was fit to ioyne another with him. The Imperialiſts ſaid almoſt the ſame things, and were more earneſt for another Secretary. The other Ambaſſadors ſtood vpon generall tearmes, deſiring a continuation of the Councell, and an vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mindes.</p>

But the Legats, ſeeing ſuch variety of opinions, after long conſultation amongſt themſelues, and with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates their friends, reſolued it was not a time to make any deciſion, but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to interpoſe ſo great a delay, that the humors might coole of themſelues, or ſome meanes might bee found to compoſe the differences, by prolonging the time of the Seſſion.

In the congregation of the third of Februarie <hi>Mantua</hi> propoſed, that, in regard Lent was neere, and that the holy dayes and feaſts of Eaſter would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low quickly, they would deferre the Seſſion, vntill after that time, and, in the meane while, in the congregations, handle the reformation belonging to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Order,</hi> and the matter of the Sacrament of mariage. But the propoſition had much contradiction. The French and Spaniards, almoſt all, were earneſt that a ſhort prorogation ſhould bee determined, and the matter of <hi>Order,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with its reformation, defined, before they treated of <hi>Matrimonie;</hi> to which opinion alſo ſome Italians did adhere. Others deſired that the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould bee helde with the things decided alreadie, and in particular, that the Decree of recidence, compoſed by the Cardinals, ſhould bee eſtabliſhed: and ſome added that it was a great indignitie to the Councell, to haue the Seſſion ſo often deferred, ſhewing there was a deſire to violence the Fathers by wearineſſe, to conſent to thoſe opinions, which they did not beleeue in their conſcience; and therefore that it ought to bee held, and matters to bee reſolued by the maior part. Some did not forbeare to ſay, that the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Seſſion and generall congregation was not reall, and that, in regard <note place="margin">No real diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a Seſſion and a general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</note> the perſons, and the ſame number were in both, that ought to bee helde for decided in the one which was determined in the other. After great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the dilation vntill the two and twentieth of Aprill was concluded by the maior part, the others ſtill contradicting. The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer hee ſeemed to conſent only to content the Legates, yet hee was willing, in regard of his owne intereſt; and that for foure cauſes. To know whether the Pope would recouer his health. To haue commoditie to treat with the Emperour. To vnderſtand the Catholike Kings mind. And to ſee the ſucceſſe of the affaires of <hi>France,</hi> that hee might reſolue what to doe, vpon better ground.</p>
            <p>The next day the French Ambaſſadours made a great and long inſtance to the Legats, to handle the reformation, and to propoſe their petitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they beganne to treate of Matrimonie. They anſwered, that the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node was not to receiue lawes from others; that if things conuenient bee propoſed by Princes, conſideration is to bee had of them, at ſuch times as the Preſident ſhall thinke fit; that if, in their petitions, any thing bee found belonging to <hi>Order,</hi> they will propoſe it together, and afterwards the other things in their time. This anſwere not conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Ambaſſadours, they deſired, that if they would not make the propoſition, they would bee content that themſelues might doe it, or elſe giue them a plaine negatiue; adding, as it were in forme of a proteſtation, that, if they continued to giue theſe ambiguous anſweres, they would hold them to bee equiualent to a ſcornefull negatiue. The Legates tooke three dayes time to giue a more preciſe anſwere, and, in the meane while, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Loraine</hi> to pacifie them, and to make them contented to expect vntill they had receiued an anſwere from <hi>Rome</hi> concerning the Articles which they had ſent thither.</p>
            <p>The next day the Articles of <hi>Matrimonie</hi> were giuen foorth, to bee diſcuſſed <note place="margin">The Articles to be diſputed</note> by the Diuines, the weeke following; in which a diſpute preſently aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the French and Spaniards, about precedence, which could not bee

compoſed to the ſatisfaction of both parties, but by changing the order obſerued vntill then, and by giuing precedence according to promotion vnto the doctorſhip. The Popes Diuines, oppoſed ſaying, that, the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie beeing betweene the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the prouiſion ſhould bee made for them alone, and their place not altered, which was vndoubtedly the firſt.

The Spaniſh Secretary deſired that a publique inſtrument might bee made of the decree, that it might appeare, that if any Frenchman ſpeake before the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> it was not by reaſon of precedence of the Kingdome. In concluſion, to giue ſatisfaction to all, an inſtrument was made, and a grant to the French-men, that, after <hi>Salmeron,</hi> the firſt of the Popiſh Diuines, the Deane of <hi>Paris</hi> would ſpeake, and the others of the firſt ranke ſhould proceede according to promotion.</p>
            <p>The Articles were eight, vpon which they were to diſpute whether they were hereticall, and ought to bee condemned. 1. That Matrimony is not a Sacrament inſtituted by God, but an humane introduction in the Church, and that it hath no promiſe of grace. 2. That the Parents may make voide ſecret marriages, and that thoſe which are ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted are not true marriages, yea, that it is expedient that hereafter they ſhould bee made voide in the Church. 3. That it is lawfull, in caſe the wife bee diuorced for cauſe of fornication, to marrie another, in the life time of the former, and that it is an error to make a diuorce for any cauſe but fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 4. That it is lawfull for Chriſtians to haue many wiues, and that the prohibition for marriage in certaine times of the yeere, is a tyrannie, which proceeded from the ſuperſtition of the Gentiles. 5. That Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie ought to bee preferred before chaſtitie, and that God giueth more grace to thoſe that are married then to others. 6. That the Prieſts of the Weſt may lawfully contract Matrimonie, notwithſtanding the vow of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall law, and that to ſay the contrary is to condemne Matrimonie, and that all thoſe who haue not the gift of chaſtitie, may marrie. 7. That the degrees of conſanguinitie, and affinitie, mentioned in the eighteenth of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> ought to bee kept, and neither more nor leſſe, 8. That inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to carnall copulation, and ignorance in the contract of mariage are onely cauſes to diſſolue Matrimonie contracted, and that the cauſes of Matrimony doe belong to Secular Princes. Of which Articles that they might briefly ſpeake, they were diuided into foure parts, according to the foure rankes of Diuines, and two appointed for each.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Renes,</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi> to the Emperour, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in <hi>Trent,</hi> who, hauing treated with <hi>Loraine,</hi> that Cardinall went to the Legates, and told them, that, euer ſince his departure out of <hi>France,</hi> hee hath had commiſſion from the King to goe to the Emperour, which hee would doe within a few dayes, becauſe he would bee in <hi>Ispruc,</hi> and becauſe <hi>Renes</hi> was come to fetch him. He gaue an account alſo of the iourney to the Pope by letters, in which hee touched the manner of the proceeding of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
               <pb n="664" facs="tcp:17208:342"/>
in Councell; adding, that if they ſo continued, hee would pray God that hee might doe ſome thing for his holy ſeruice. They had talked of this iourney a moneth before, and therefore when it was publiſhed, the ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not ſo great as if it had not been foreſeen. All men aſſured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that it was to make a combination concerning the Councell, and, particularly, to bring in the vſe of the Cup; and the rather, becauſe the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall had ſaid to many Prelates, vpon diuers occaſions, that the Emperour, <note place="margin">Diſcourſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Iſpruc.</hi>
               </note> Kings of the Romanes, and of <hi>France,</hi> would neuer leaue to make petitions for Reformation, vntill they had obtained the vſe of the Chalice, though they were to remaine two yeeres in Councell; but that fauour beeing gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they would eaſily bee quieted, and that to giue ſatisfaction to thoſe Princes, was the beſt meanes to retaine thoſe Kingdomes in obedience; that it was impoſſible to obtaine it of the Pope, in regard of the oppoſition of the Cardinals, who abhorred the grant; that it was not hitherto obtained in Councell, becauſe the buſineſſe was not well mannaged, and that there was hope, that vſing good meanes, it might bee gained. But thoſe who did more attentiuely marke the Cardinals proceedings, obſerued a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie in his ſpeaches, For ſometimes hee ſaid, that, in caſe matters were not reſolued, hee ſhould bee forced to depart at <hi>Eaſter</hi> or at <hi>Whitſuntide;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that hee would remaine in <hi>Trent</hi> two yeeres; ſometimes propoſing meanes to diſpatch the Councell, and ſometimes taking courſes to make it euerlaſting; manifeſt arguments, that as yet hee knew not his owne inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And they ſuſpected his cautelous proceeding, which did argue a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to iuſtifie his reaſons by Art, and make his cauſe honeſt. And conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that in <hi>Ispruc</hi> would bee the King of the Romanes, the Duke of <hi>Baua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Salzburg</hi> and the Arch-duke <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> it was thought that this conference muſt needes produce ſome nouities; eſpecially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſmall ſatisfaction which the Councell had hitherto giuen the Emperour, and of the vnion, in all matters betweene <hi>France</hi> and him. And it might bee thought alſo that the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> ſo neere vnto him in blood, would adhere to that partie; and the rather, becauſe it was diuulged, that, by his letters of the eight of Iune, hee had giuen commiſſion to the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> to hold intelligence with the Emperour, and the King of <hi>France,</hi> in matters of reformation and libertie of the Councel. In theſe dayes Friar <hi>Felicianus Ninguarda,</hi> Proctor of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Salzburg,</hi> preſented the letters of that Prince, and made inſtance, that the Proctors of the Biſhops of <hi>Germanie</hi> might giue voice in Congregations; affirming, that, if it were granted, other Biſhops of <hi>Germanie</hi> would ſend Proctors, if otherwiſe, both himſelfe and others would depart, becauſe they would not bee idle. It was anſwered, that conſideration ſhould bee had of it, and a reſolution taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to right. And they gaue an acount hereof to <hi>Rome,</hi> and would not reſolue ſo much as this ſmall particular without aduice from thence. But in regard of greater buſineſſes in both places, there was no more ſpeach of it.</p>
            <p>The ninth of February the firſt Congregation of Diuines was held, to diſpute of Matrimonie. <hi>Salmeron</hi> ſpake in a very lofty ſtile; and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt Article, deliuered the vſuall ſayings of the Schoolemen. For the ſecond, hee alleadged the determination of the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> that
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:17208:342"/>
Matrimony receiueth perfection only by the conſent of the contractors, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the Father; or any other, any authority ouer it. He defended; that they ought to bee condemned for heretiques, who attribute power to the father to make it void; that the authoritie of the Church was very greate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the matter of Sacraments, that it can alter whatſoeuer is not of the eſſence; that the condition of publique and ſecret beeing accidentall, the Church had power therein. Hee ſhewed the great inconueniences of ſecret mariages, and innumerable adulteries which follow, and concluded that it was expedient to vſe a remedie, by making them voide. He inſiſted much vpon this inextricable caſe; if, after matrimony contracted and conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſecret, one doth contract in publique with another, from which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to depart, and returne to the firſt lawfull wife, is forced by cenſures to remaine in the publique contract; the poore man is intangled on both ſides, either in perpetuall adultery, or in cenſures, with ſcandall of his neighbour.</p>
            <p>The next day the Deane of <hi>Paris</hi> followed; who ſpake copiouſly out of ſchoole doctrine, of the inſtitution of marriage, of the grace which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in it, and of condemning him that doth affirme it to bee an humane inuention. But vpon the article of clandeſtine matrimonie, hauing diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they were true mariages and ſacraments, he put a doubt whether the Church hath power to make them void. He contradicted the opinion, that there is authority in the Church ouer the matter of Sacraments; hee diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the Church cannot make any Sacrament which is now lawfull, to be of no force for hereafter, hee exemplified in the conſecration of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, and went through all the Sacraments. Hee ſaid the Eccleſiaſticall power was not ſuch, as to bee able to hinder all ſinnes; that the Chriſtian Church hath beene 1500. yeeres ſubiect to that which is now deſcribed to bee intolerable, and, (which is of no leſſe importance) ſecret mariages haue beene accounted good euen from the beginning of the world, and no man hath euer thought to make a nullity in them, howſoeuer a publique contract hath often followed them; that it ſeemeth to bee inſoluble, though it hath inconueniences on both ſides; that the mariage of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> a patterne for all other, was without witneſſes. The opinion of the Doctor was not diſeſteemed; but the <hi>Italian</hi> Prelats were well pleaſed, that hauing once na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Pope, hee gaue him this Epithite, with the expoſition following, <hi>Gouernour and moderator of the Roman Church,</hi> that is, <hi>of the Vniuerſall.</hi> And this did miniſter much diſcourſe. For the Papalins concluded, that it might likewiſe be ſaid in the Canon of the inſtitution, that the Pope hath power to gouerne the Vniuerſall Church. But the French men anſwered, that there was great difference betweene ſaying abſolutely the Church Vniuerſall, by which is vnderſtood the Vniuerſality of the faithfull, and ſaying the Roman Church, that is the Vniuerſall, where the word Roman doth declare the word Vniuerſall, inferring that hee is Head of the Vniuerſall, and that all places, in which authority is giuen to the Pope ouer all the Church, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood diſiunctiuely, not coniunctiuely, that is, ouer euery part of the Church, not ouer all together.</p>
            <p>The eleuenth of February, the French-men preſented, in Congregation, a
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:17208:343"/>
letter from their King, of the eighteenth of Ianuary; in which hee ſaid, that howſoeuer hee was aſſured that the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> had imparted to the Synode, the happy victory againſt the enemies of religion, whoſe bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hee hath and doth daylie oppoſe without reſpect of difficulty, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, euen expoſing his owne life, as becommeth the eldeſt and moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſonne of the Church, yet himſelfe was willing to make them partakers of the ſame ioy alſo, knowing that the wholeſome remedies, for the euills <note place="margin">Letters from the French K. are preſented in Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> which doe afflict Chriſtian Prouinces, haue alwaies beene expected from Councels. He deſired of them, in the name of CHRIST, an emendation and reformation, anſwerable to the expectation the world hath conceiued of them; and that as himſelfe, and ſo many beſides, haue conſecrated life and blood to God in thoſe warres, ſo they, in reſpect of their charge, would, <note place="margin">And <hi>de Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieres</hi> maketh a ſpeach.</note> with ſinceritie of conſcience, be carefull of the buſineſſe for which they are aſſembled. The letters being read, the Ambaſſadour <hi>de Ferrieres</hi> ſpake to the Fathers in this ſubſtance. That they hauing vnderſtood by the Kings let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and before by the orations of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> the deſolation of <hi>France,</hi> and ſome victories of the King, he would not relate them againe, but onely ſay, that the laſt, in regard of the forces of the enemie, was miraculous; whereof this is an argument, that being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, yet hee doth liue, and committeth ſpoiles, running through the very bowels of <hi>France.</hi> But hee ſaid, hee would turne his ſpeech to them onely, who are the onely refuge of the miſeries, without whom <hi>France</hi> will not bee able to preſerue the tables of ſhipwracke. Hee exemplified in the armie of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which had not beene able to ouercome <hi>Amalec,</hi> if the hands of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> lifted vp to God, vnderpropped by <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Vr,</hi> had not aſſiſted the combar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; that the King of <hi>France</hi> doth not want forces, a valiant Captaine the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the Queene Mother, to mannage the affaires of warre and peace; that there is no other <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Vr</hi> but themſelues, to hold vp the hands of the moſt Chriſtian King, with Decrees of the Synode, without which the enemies will neuer bee reconciled, nor the Catholiques preſerued in the faith; that the humour of Chriſtians now, is not the ſame as it was fiftie yeeres ſince; that all Catholiques are now like to the <hi>Samaritanes,</hi> who did not beleeue the womans relation of CHRIST, vntill they had inquired, and informed themſelues; that a great part of Chriſtendome doth ſtudy the Scriptures, and that the moſt Chriſtian King, had giuen no inſtructions to his Ambaſſadours, but conformable to them, which they haue preſented, to the Legates, who preſently will propoſe them, as they haue promiſed, to them the Fathers, to whom the moſt Chriſtian King doth principally ſend them, expecting their iudgement vpon them; that <hi>France</hi> doth not demand any ſingular thing, but common to all the Catholique Church; that if any maruell that the moſt neceſſary things are omitted in the propoſitions, hee may aſſure himſelfe that they beginne with the ſmaller matters, that they may propoſe the other of more weight, in their fit time, as alſo to giue an eaſie execution to thoſe; which if they the Fathers will not beginne before they depart from <hi>Trent,</hi> the Catholiques will cry out, the aduerſaries will laugh, and will both ſay, that the fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> doe not want knowledge, but a will to doe good, and that they haue conſtituted good lawes, without
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:17208:343"/>
touching them ſo much as with one of their fingers, but leauing the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of them to their poſterity. And if, in the demands exhibited, any doe thinke that ſome thing is contained conformable to the bookes of the aduerſaries, he holdeth them vnworthy of anſwere: to thoſe who hold them immoderate, hee will ſay nothing but that of <hi>Cicero,</hi> that it is an abſurdity to deſire temperance of mediocrity in the beſt things, which are ſo much the better, by how much the bigger they are. He ſaid the holy Ghoſt did ſay to lukewarme moderators, that hee would caſt them out of the body; that they ſhould conſider the ſmall good the Church had, by the moderate reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Councel of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and of the next, which he would not nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, for feare of offending the eares of ſome, and likewiſe of the Councels of <hi>Ferrara, Florence,</hi> the <hi>Laterane,</hi> and the firſt of <hi>Trent,</hi> and how many ſorts of men, how many Prouinces, Kingdomes, and Nations, haue ſince depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Church. Hee turned his ſpeech to the Italian and Spaniſh Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that a ſerious emendation of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline was more for the good of them, then of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the chiefe Vicar of CHRIST, and ſucceſſour of <hi>Peter,</hi> who hath the higheſt authority in the Church of God, that their life and honour was in queſtion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he would ſay no more.</p>
            <p>In the anſwere to the letters and the Ambaſſadours Oration, the King <note place="margin">The anſwere.</note> was commended for his pious &amp; noble actes, and exhorted, as if he had been preſent, to imitate his predeceſſors, turning all his cogitations to the defence of the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> and preſeruation of the ancient faith and to giue eare to thoſe who preach vnto him the Kingdome of God, and not to thoſe who preach a preſent vtility, and an imaginary tranquillity, which will neuer be a true peace; adding, that the King would ſurely doe ſo by the help of GOD, and in regard of the goodneſſe of his diſpoſition, of the Counſell of the Queene Mother, and of the Nobility of <hi>France;</hi> that the Synod will labour to define things neceſſary for the reformation of the Church vniuerſall, and for the good and intereſts of the particular of the Kingdome of <hi>France.</hi> In the end of the Congregation, the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> propoſed, that, to make a more quicke diſpatch, the Congregations of the Diuines might bee held twice a day, and Prelates deputed to propoſe the correction of the abuſes, in the matter of <hi>Order;</hi> and ſo it was decreed.</p>
            <p>The biting ſpeach of the Ambaſſador did pierce the mindes of the Papa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins; and particularly, when hee ſayd, that the Articles were addreſſed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to the Synode: Which words they thought were contrarie to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that the Legates onely ſhould propoſe, a principall ſecret to preſerue the Popes authoritie. But they were mooued more, that he ſaid that he had deferred the propoſition of more important matters, vntill another time, whence they drew great conſequences, eſpecially hauing alwayes feared, that they had not as yet diſcouered their deſſeignes, and that they did plot greater matters. As alſo to ſpeake vnto the Italian and Spaniſh Fathers, as if they had other intereſts then the Pope, ſeemed a ſeditious manner of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The Ambaſſadour gaue a copie of his Oration; and by thoſe words which hee ſpake of the Pope, <hi>That hee hath ſupreame authoritie in the Church of God,</hi> ſome Popiſh Prelates noted, that, in reciting them, hee had ſayd,
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:17208:344"/>
Who hath full power in the Church vniuerſall; drawing them to the fauour of their opinion, and diſputing that it was as much to haue full power in the Church-vniuerſall, as to gouerne the Church-vniuerſall, which the French-men did ſo much abhorre, in the Decree of the inſtitution. But himſelfe and the other Frenchmen affirmed, that hee had pronounced them as they were written.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Loraine</hi> went to <hi>Iſpruc,</hi> to viſit the Emperour and King of <note place="margin">The Card of <hi>Loraine</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to <hi>Iſpruc.</hi>
               </note> the Romans, accompanied with nine Prelats, and foure Diuines of the moſt learned amongſt them. He had firſt a promiſe from the Legats, that while hee was abſent, the Article of the marriage of Prieſts ſhould not be handled, which he did inſtantly deſire, that nothing might be determined or precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued contrary to the commiſſion which he had from the Kings, to obtaine of the Councell a diſpenſation for the Cardinall of <hi>Bourbon</hi> to marry. Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Altemps</hi> alſo went to <hi>Rome,</hi> recalled by the Pope, to be Generall of the <note place="margin">A diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to marry for the Card of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> Card. <hi>Altemps</hi> is to be ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

For vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that leuies were made in <hi>Germany,</hi> by the Dukes of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Witten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg:</hi> and by the <hi>Landgraue</hi> of <hi>Haſsia,</hi> howſoeuer it was generally beleeued, that all was done to aſſiſt the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> yet conſidering that the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> had written, that the Dutchmen had a great deſire to inuade <hi>Rome,</hi> and did remember the Sacke ſixe and thirtie yeeres ſince, hee thought it was wiſedome not to bee vnprouided, and, for the ſame cauſe, reuiued the treatie of making a combination with all the Italian Princes, for the defence of Religion.</p>
            <p>In the congregations, the Diuines of the firſt ranke did vniformly agree in condemning the firſt article, &amp; euery part thereof, as hereticall; as alſo the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſaying that ſecret marriages were true mariages. But there was the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence before metioned betweene <hi>Salmeron</hi> and the Deane of <hi>Paris,</hi> whether the Church hath power to make them void. Thoſe who held the negatiue, ſtood vpon that ground, that the matter, forme, miniſter, &amp; receiuer are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in euery Sacrament, in which, as being inſtituted by God no Eccleſiaſtical power hath any thing to doe. They ſaid that the Councell of <hi>Florence</hi> hauing declared, that the conſent of the parties onely is neceſſary to Matrimonie, he that would inferre the word, Publique, for a neceſſary condition, doeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that the conſent only is not ſufficient, and that the Councell of <hi>Florence</hi> hath failed in a neceſſary declaration. That CHRIST ſayd in generall of Matrimonie, that man cannot ſeparate that which GOD hath ioyned, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning both the publique and the ſecret coniunction. That in the Sacraments nothing ought to be affirmed without authoritie of the Scriptures, or tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither of which doe allow this authoritie to the Church; yea, by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wee finde the contrary, becauſe all Churches in all nations through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world are vniforme; in not pretending any power herein. On the contrary, it was ſaid to be a cleere caſe, that the Church hath power to make any man vncapable of marriage, becauſe many degrees of conſanguinitie and affinitie are made hinderances by the Eccleſiaſticall law onely; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the impediment of a ſolemne vow was made by the Popes law; and therefore ſecrecie may bee likewiſe made an impediment, by the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. The other part anſwered, that the prohibition by reaſon of kinred, is
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:17208:344"/>
               <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the Pope, and many of his ſucceſſors haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; that matrimonie cannot be contracted betweene two, vntill it bee knowen in what degree of kinred they are ioyned, and if other Popes haue reſtrained this vniuerſalitie to the ſeuenth degree, &amp; afterwards to the fourth, this was a generall diſpenſation, as Diuorce was to the Iewes, and that a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vow doeth hinder <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> not by the Popes authoritie.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Camillus Campeggius,</hi> a Dominican Friar, agreeing with the others, that no humane power is extended to the Sacraments, added, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can deſtroy the eſſence of the matter, can alſo make it vncapable of the Sacrament; that no man can make water not to be the matter of <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> or ſome bread of wheat not to bee the matter of the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> but hee that ſhall deſtroy the water, turning it into ayre, or ſhall burne the bread, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it into aſhes, ſhall make thoſe matters not to bee capable of the forme of the Sacraments: So in Matrimony, the ciuill nuptiall contract is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the matrimoniall Sacrament, by Diuine inſtitution; which beeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and made of no force, can no more bee the matter of it. Therefore it cannot bee ſaid that the Church can make a nullity in the ſecret marriage, for ſo it would haue authority ouer the Sacraments, but it is true that the Church can nullifie a ſecret nuptiall contract, which, as beeing voyd, cannot receiue the forme of a Sacrament. This doctrine did much pleaſe the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Fathers, becauſe it was plaine, eaſie, and reſolued all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. But <hi>Antonius Soliſius,</hi> who ſpake after him, did contradict, ſaying, the ſpeculation was true, but could not bee applied to this purpoſe. For the reaſon, as it is meant of Baptiſme and the Euchariſt, that whoſoeuer doeth deſtroy the water and the bread, doeth make them vncapable of the formes of thoſe Sacraments, doeth not argue an Eccleſiaſticall power, but a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, ſo that whoſoeuer hath vertue to deſtroy the water, may, by this meanes, hinder the Sacrament; whereby it would follow, that hee that can nullifie a ciuill nuptiall contract, may hinder Matrimonie, but the annullation of ſuch contracts belongeth to the ciuill Lawes, and to ſecular Magiſtrates; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt take heede, leſt while they would giue authoritie to the Church to make voyd ſecret marriages, it bee not rather giuen to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe who attributed this power to the Church, it was diſputed whether it were fit that the Church ſhould vſe it. And there were two opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. One, to make voyd all the ſecret, in regard of the inconueniences which enſue. The other, that the publique, made without conſent of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in whoſe power they are, ſhould be made voyd alſo. And theſe allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged two reaſons; one, that as great inconueniences did follow by theſe, in reſpect of the ruines which happen to families, by mariages vnaduiſedly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by yong men, the other that the Law of GOD, commanding obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to parents, doeth include this caſe as principall. That the Law of GOD doeth giue this particular authoritie to the Father, to giue his daughter in marriage, as it plainely appeareth in Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Exodus.</hi> That there are examples of the Patriarches in the olde Teſtament, all married by their fathers. That the humane ciuill Lawes haue eſteemed the marriages voide, which haue beene contracted without the father. That as then it was iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:17208:345"/>
expedient to nullifie ſecret marriages, ſo now, ſeeing that the Popes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition is not ſufficient, which hath forbidden them without addition of nullitie, there is more reaſon, in regard the malice of man will not obey the Law of GOD, which forbiddeth to marry without conſent of parents, that the Synode ſhould adde vnto it a nullity alſo; not becauſe the Fathers haue authoritie to make voyde the marriages of children, which is hereſie to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, but becauſe the Church hath authoritie to nullifie both theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contracts, prohibited by diuine or humane Lawes. This opinion, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, pious, and as well grounded as the other, pleaſed many of the Fathers. And ſo was the Decree framed, howſoeuer the publication was omitted, for cauſes which ſhall be related hereafter.</p>
            <p>But the Prelates did not for beare to diſcuſſe the controuerſies about the Popes authoritie, and inſtitution of Biſhops. And the Frenchmen did perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere in their reſolution, not to admit the words, <hi>Church-Vniuerſall,</hi> leſt they ſhould preiudice the opinion held in <hi>France,</hi> of the ſuperioritie of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; and if it had beene propoſed, would haue made proteſtation of the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and departed. The Pope wrote it ſhould bee propoſed, whatſoeuer did <note place="margin">The Legates dare not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Biſhops.</note> follow. But the Legats fearing that euery little ſtirre would be much out of ſeaſon now the Emperour was ſo neere, wrote backe, that it was better to deferre it vntill the Article of Matrimony was finiſhed.</p>
            <p>The ſeuenteenth of February Father <hi>Soto</hi> was the firſt that ſpake in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ranke; who, vpon the Article of Diuorce, did firſt diſtinguiſh the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall coniunction into three parts: the bond, the cohabitation, and the carnall copulation; inferring that there were as many ſeparations alſo. He ſhewed at large that the Eccleſiaſticall Prelate had authoritie to ſeparate the married, or to giue them a diuorce, in reſpect of cohabitation, and carnall copulation, for all cauſes which they ſhall iudge expedient and reaſonable, the matrimoniall bond ſtill ſtanding ſure, ſo that neither can marrie againe; ſaying, that this was it which was bound by GOD, and could not bee looſed by any. He was much troubled with the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who granteth to the faithfull husband, if the vnbeleeuing wife will not dwell with him, to remaine ſeparated. Hee was not contented with the common expoſition, that the Matrimonie of the vnbeleeuers is not inſoluble, alleadging, that the inſolubilitie is by the law of Nature, as alſo the words of <hi>Adam,</hi> expounded by our SAVIOVR, and the vſe of the Church, that married vnbeleeuers, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue beene Baptized, are not married againe; and that their matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie is not different from that of the faithfull. And he refolued to approue the expoſition of <hi>Caietan,</hi> that the ſeparation, mentioned by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> of the faithfull from the vnbeleeuer, is not vnderſtood of the matrimoniall bond, and that it was a thing worthy to be conſidered by the holy Synod. For For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication he ſayd, that it ought not to be a cauſe of ſeparation from the bond, but from copulation, and cohabitation onely. But he found himſelfe much intangled, becauſe hee had ſaid firſt that diuorce might bee granted in many reſpects, and for many cauſes, whereas the Goſpel doth admit but one, which is Fornication, which muſt needes be vnderſtood in reſpect of the bond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Diuorce in the other two reſpects may haue many cauſes. Hee gaue many expoſitions of that place of the Goſpel, without approcuing or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:17208:345"/>
any of them; and concluded that the Article ought to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, becauſe the contrary is made an Article of faith, by Apoſtolicall tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, howbeit the words of the Goſpel are not ſo plaine as that they are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to conuince the <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the fourth Article of <hi>Polygamic,</hi> hee ſayd it was againſt the law of Nature, nor could bee permitted ſo much as to infidels, who are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to Chriſtians. Hee ſaid the ancient Fathers had many wiues by diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and the others, who were not diſpenſed with by GOD, did liue in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſinne. For the prohibition of marriages at certaine times, he briefly alleadged the authoritie of the Church, and the diſconuenience of marriage with ſome times: and tooke this occaſion to ſay, that no man had reaſon to be grieued, becauſe the Biſhop might diſpence. Hee returned to the cauſes of Diuorce, and concluded that the world would not complaine of any of theſe things, if the Prelates did vſe their authoritie with wiſedome and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But the cauſe of all the euils is, becauſe they doe not reſide, but giue the gouernement to a Vicar, and oftentimes, without conuenient maintenance, ſo that Iuſtice is ill adminiſtred, and <hi>graces</hi> not well beſtowed. And here hee ſpake at large of Reſidence, ſaying, that if it were not declared to bee <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> it was impoſſible to remooue thoſe and other abuſes, and to ſtoppe the mouthes of heretiques, who not obſeruing that the euill commeth from the bad execution, lay the blame vpon the Popes conſtitutions; and therefore the Popes authoritie will neuer be defended well, but by Reſidence well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; nor that well executed without the declaration, <hi>de iure diuino;</hi> and that they did notoriouſly erre, who thought it preiudiciall to the authority of the Pope, whereas it is the onely foundation to vphold and preſerue it. Hee concluded, that the Councell was bound to determine the trueth, and ſpake with ſuch efficacie, that he was willingly heard by the <hi>Vltramontans,</hi> but did diſpleaſe the Papalins, who thought the time impertinent to touch that matter. And it gaue occaſion to both parties to renew their practiſes.</p>
            <p>In the Congregation of the twentieth of February, <hi>Iohn Ramirez,</hi> a Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan Friar, after hee had ſpoken vpon the ſame Articles, according to the common opinion of Diuines, of the inſolubilitie of mariage, ſayd, that the ſame reaſons which are betweene man and wife, are alſo betweene the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and the Church, and that as the man ought not to depart from his wife, ſo ought not the Biſhop to depart from his Church, and that this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall bond was of no leſſe force then the other which was corporall. Hee alleadged <hi>Innocence</hi> the third, who decreed that a Biſhop could not bee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred but by the diuine authoritie becauſe the matrimoniall bond, which is leſſe (ſayd the Pope) cannot be diſſolued by any power of man. And he was copious in ſhewing that the Popes authoritie was rather increaſed then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed hereby, who, as a generall Vicar, might make vſe of Biſhops in an other place, where there was more neede: as the Prince may employ maried men for publique occaſions, ſending them to other places, without diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the matrimoniall bond. And hee laboured to reſolue the cotrary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with much prolixity.</p>
            <p>In the Congregation of that afternoone, Doctor <hi>Corniſius</hi> ſaid, that both theſe Aricles, the third and fourth, were hereticall, becauſe they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:17208:346"/>
by many <hi>Decretals</hi> of Popes, and oxalted the authority of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Sea in many words, ſaying, that all ancient Councels, in the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of faith, did perpetually follow the authority and will of the Pope: Hee exemplified in the Councell of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in <hi>Trullus,</hi> which followed the inſtruction ſent by Pope <hi>Agathone,</hi> the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> which did not onely follow, but worſhip the ſentence of St. <hi>Leo</hi> the Pope; calling him alſo Ecumenicall, and Paſtour of the Vniuerſall Church. And after hee had alleadged many authorities and reaſons, to ſhow that the words of CHRIST, ſpoken to Saint <hi>Poter (Feede my ſheepe)</hi> doe ſignifie as much as if hee had ſayd, rule and gouerne the Church Vniuerſall, he amplified very much the Popes authoritie in diſpenſations, and other things alſo. Hee brought the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Canoniſts, that the Pope may diſpence againſt the Canons, againſt the Apoſtles, and in all the law of GOD, except the Articles of faith. In the ende, hee alleadged the Chapter, <hi>Si Papa,</hi> that euery one ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that his ſaluation doth depend, after GOD, vpon the holineſſe of the Pope; amplifying theſe words, becauſe they proceede from a Saint, and a Martyr, of whom no man can ſay that he did reſpect any thing but the trueth.</p>
            <p>At this time <hi>Commendone</hi> returned from the Emperour, whoſe negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had not that ſucceſſe as the Legats deſired. For the Emperour, hearing his propoſitions, anſwered, that hee muſt haue time to thinke on them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their importance, and that hee would conſider of them, and anſwere <note place="margin">The relation of <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done</hi> returned from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> the Councell by his Ambaſſadour. Hee preſently gaue an account heere of by letters, adding, that hee found the Emperour was grieued, and had an ill conceit of the actions of the Councell. Beeing now returned, hee ſayd further, that by the words of his Maieſtie, and by that which he had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by his counſellers, and obſerued by their proceedings, hee thought hee knew that hee was ſo firme in that bad opinion, that hee feared ſome diſorder would enſue. That as farre as hee could comprehend, the cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Maieſtie were wholly bent to obtaine a great reformation, with ſuch prouiſions as that it might bee obſerued; and that hee could certainely affirme, that he would not bee content that the Councell ſhould be finiſhed. That hee had vnderſtood, that <hi>Delphinus,</hi> the <hi>Nuncio</hi> reſident, hauing named ſuſpenſion or tranſlation, the Emperour was offended. Then hee related that there was an opinion in that Court that the Catholique King held in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence with the Emperour concerning the affaires of the Councel, which hee did beleeue, becauſe hee was aſſured that the Spaniſh Prelates had ſent letters to him, in which were complaints againſt the proceedings of the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, and many Articles of Reformation, which 'tis like they would not dart to doe, except they knew their Kings minde. Hee ſaid alſo, that the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> when the Popes miniſters had ſpoken of the too much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Spaniſh Prelates in their ſpeaches, anſwered thus, what could bee done if thoſe Prelates ſhould ſay that they ſpake as they thought in their conſcience; Hee layd moreouer, that in the conference hee will haue with the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> hee was of opinion that they would conclude to make their petitions to bee propoſed by the Ambaſſadours; and that his Maieſtie had cauſed his Diuines to conſult vpon them, and vpon other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliarie
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:17208:346"/>
affaires; and that howſoeuer himſelfe and the <hi>Nuncio Delphinus</hi> had vſed much diligence yet they were not able to learne the particulars.</p>
            <p>But within a ſhort time they came to light. For the Ieſuite <hi>Caniſius</hi> do rote to the Generall <hi>Laynez,</hi> that the Emperour was ill affected towards the Councell and made many points to bee conſulted on, that hee might reſolde how to proceede, in caſe the Pope did prefeuere in refuſing to propoſe the reformation or in giuing words contrary to his deeds. One point was, what <note place="margin">Points conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on in the Emperours cour.</note> the Emperours authoritie might be in Councell; and that <hi>Fredericus Staphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> Confeſſor to the Queene of <hi>Bahemia,</hi> was the chiefe man in the conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Caniſius</hi> deſired that one of the Societie might be ſent vnto him, whom he might bring into the conſultation, and by him diſcouer all. Whereupon <hi>Laynez</hi> hauing conferred with Cardinall <hi>Simoneta,</hi> they reſolued to ſend Father <hi>Natalis,</hi> by whom all was diſcouered. And the Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted on were ſeuenteene. 1. Whether a generall Councell, lawfully <note place="margin">In number 17</note> aſſembled by the fauour of Princes, may change the order determined by the Pope to be obſerued in handling the matters, and bring in a new man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. 2. Whether it be profitable for the Church that the Councell ſhould handlematters, and determine them as it is directed by the Pope or Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that it may not doe otherwiſe. 3. Whether, if the Pope die in time of the councell, the Fathers thereof ought to chooſe another. 4. What the Emperours power is, the <hi>Sea</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> being voyde, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell open 5. Whether, when matters are handled concerning the peace and tranquillitie of the Chriſtian common wealth, the Ambaſſadours of Princes ought to haue a deciding voice, howſoeuer they haue it not concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matters of faith. 6. Whether Princes may recall their Orators and Prelates from the councell, without imparting it to the Legats. 7. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope may diſſolue or ſuſpend the Counſel without the participation of Princes, and eſpecially of the Emperour. 8. Whether it be fit that Princes ſhould interpoſe, to cauſe more neceſſarie and expedient matters to be handled in Counſell. 9. Whether the Orators of Princes may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to the Fathers in perſon, thoſe things which the Princes commit vnto them, to be expounded. 10. Whether a meanes may be found, that the Fathers, ſent by the Pope and Princes, may bee free in giuing their voyces in Councell. 11. What courſe may be taken, that the Pope and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> may not interpoſe in ordayning that which is to be handled in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, that the libertie of the Fathers may not bee hindered. 12. Whether a meanes may be found that no fraude, violence, or extortion bee vſed in deliuering the opinions of the Fathers. 13. Whether any thing may bee handled, bee it point of doctrine, or reformation of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it bee diſcuſſed by the learnell. 14. what remedie may bee found, if the Italian Prelates doecont inue their obſtinacie in not ſuffering matters to be reſolued. 15. What remedie may be vſed to him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap> of the Italian Prelates, when the Popes authoritie is in queſtion. 16. Now the practiſes may bee remoued which hinder the determination of the point of reſidencie. 17. Whether it bee ſeemely that the Emperour ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally aſſiſt in Councell.</p>
            <p>But a long and ſerious conſultation was held in <hi>Rome,</hi> whether the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions <note place="margin">A conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Rome.</hi>

of the French-men ought to be propoſed? and they conſideredred not ſo much the weight of the things themſelues, as the conſequences thereof. For obſeruing what <hi>de Ferrieres</hi> had ſaid in his Oration, that the petitions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited were of the lighter ſort, and that others remained of more weight, they coniectured that the French-men, hauing not made thoſe demands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſired to obtaine them, they aimed to make entrance by that way, to propoſe others which they had in their minde, and that, by theſe which they call light, the gate being opened, paſſage might not bee denied them what attempt ſoeuer they would make beſides. For theſe and other reſpects it was reſolued to write to the Legates, that, abſolutely, they ſhould not bee propoſed, nor a negatiue giuen, but onely a delay interpoſed; and the meanes they were to vſe, were written alſo. At the ſame time, a writing of an vncertaine Authour came from <hi>Rome,</hi> in anſwere of thoſe petitions, <note place="margin">A writing publiſhed in <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the French petitions.</note> which immediately was ſpread in <hi>Trent,</hi> and in the Emperors Court. And it was beleeued in <hi>Rome,</hi> that, by theſe meanes, they had giuen a good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe to the inſtances of the French-men. But the Pope was more troubled with the nouitie at the Emperours Court to conſult of matters ſo preiudiciall to him, knowing well that the Papall dignitie is preſerued by the reuerence, and certaine perſwaſion of Chriſtians that it cannot bee called into queſtion, that when the world doeth begin to examine matters, apparant reaſons will not be wanting to diſturbe the beſt things. He obſerued that his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors had vſed potent remedies in like occaſions, and that when the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith is queſtioned, that precept, to reſiſt the beginnings, taketh place. For as, in the breaches of riuers, if the ſmalleſt ruptures be not ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, the chanell cannot be kept full, ſo when there is but a ſmall ouerture againſt the ſupreame authoritie, and not ſtopped, it is eaſily caried to an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute downefall. Hee was counſelled to write a <hi>Briefe</hi> to the Emperour, concerning this his diſtaſte, as <hi>Paul</hi> the third did to the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> about the <hi>Colloquies</hi> of <hi>Spira,</hi> and reprehend him for queſtioning thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as things that are moſt cleare, and in another <hi>Briefe</hi> to reproue the Counſellers, for perſwading him to it, and to admoniſh the Diuines who haue aſſiſted in the buſineſſe, to ſeeke an abſolution from the cenſures. But hauing thought well on it, hee conſidered that the ſtate of things was not then as it was vnder <hi>Paul.</hi> Firſt, becauſe that diſputation was publike, whereas this was priuate, and concealed of purpoſe that it might not bee knowne, ſo that hee might diſſemble all notice of it, whereas if it ſhould continue after his publike reprehenſion of it, hee ſhould put himſelfe into greater danger; that it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient for <hi>Charles</hi> to ſtand vnited with the Pope that he might not ſubiect himſelfe to the Dutch Princes, whereas this Emperour is, as it were, ſubiect vnto them alreadie; finally that this remedie might bee deferred, becauſe it would alwayes bee in ſeaſon, but by diſſembling a while, hee might obliquely make triall to hinder the reſolution of the conſultations which were made, by ſending the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua</hi> to his Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>The writing which went about againſt the petitions of the French-men, did not one diſpleaſe them, who tooke it for an affront, but the Emperour <note place="margin">Diſpleaſeth the French-men, and the Emperour.</note> alſo very much. And the Legates hauing receiued commiſſion from <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb n="675" facs="tcp:17208:347"/>
concerning them, were but ill ſatisfied, and thought that this was not to giue commiſſion to Preſidents of Councell, but aduertiſments rather to miniſters to make vſe of intreaties by way of negotiation. They wrote backe onely to demand what they ſhould doe, in caſe the Imperialiſts ſhould make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to haue their petitions propoſed: and they cauſed <hi>Gabriel Paleotto,</hi> Auditor of the <hi>Rota,</hi> to write a full information of the difficulties, which they ſent. But the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> in regard the Emperour had tolde <hi>Commendone,</hi> that hee would giue anſwere to the Councell by his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, thought it not conuenient to goe vnto him before they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that reſolution: beſides, the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> being at the Emperors Court, and the effect of his negotiation not knowne, hee ſhould be doubtfull in what manner to proceede. Vpon theſe reaſons hee excuſed himſelfe to <note place="margin">The Card. of <hi>mantua</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth freely to the Pope.</note> the Pope, and beſides wrote to him with his owne hand, that hee had not a face to appeare any more in Congregation, to giue wordes onely, as hee had done two yeeres together; that all the Miniſters of Princes doe ſay, that howſoeuer his Holineſſe doth promiſe much for reformation, yet ſeeing nothing to bee executed, they doe not thinke hee hath any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to it; who if hee had performed his promiſes, the Legates could not haue beene Wanting to giue ſatisfaction to the inſtances of ſo many Princes. Neither ought any to maruaile that this Cardinall, a Prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant ſo many long yeeres in many great affaires, and of a moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate conuerſation, ſhould vſe this paſſage with his Holineſſe, it bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing naturall to men that are neere their graue, for ſome intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficall cauſe, vnknowen euen vnto themſelues, to bee diſtaſted with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane matters, and to neglect pure ceremonies; to which gaole hee was then very neere, there remayning but ſixe dayes of his life from the date hereof.</p>
            <p>But in the Congregation, the laſt that ſpake in the ſecond ranke was <hi>Adrian,</hi> a Dominican Friar; who, touching but lightly the matter in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſcourſed at large of diſpenſations, and, with Theologicall tearmes and formes defended the things mentioned by Doctour <hi>Corniſius,</hi> and ſpeake of them, not without ſcandall. Hee ſayd that authoritie to diſpence in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes, was abſolute, and vnlimited in the Pope, becauſe hee was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to them all; and therefore when hee did diſpence, though without any cauſe, the diſpenſation was notwithſtanding to bee held for good: that in diuine lawes he had power to diſpence, but not without a cauſe. Hee alleadged Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, that the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of CHRIST <hi>are the diſpencers of the myſteries of God;</hi> and that to him the Apoſtle, <hi>diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel had beene committed.</hi> Hee added, that howſoeuer the Popes diſpenſation concerning the Diuine Law bee not of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orce, yet euery one ought to captiuate his vnderſtanding, and beleeue that hee hath granted it for a lawfull cauſe, and that it is temeritie to call it into queſtion. Then hee diſcourſed of the cauſe of diſpenſations; which hee reduced to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique vtilitie, and charitie towards priuate men. This diſcourſe gaue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the French men to ſpeake of the matter, with the ill ſatisfaction of the Papalins.</p>
            <p>The ſecondranke hauing made an end of ſpeaking, for obſeruation of the
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:17208:348"/>
promiſe made to <hi>Loraine,</hi> not to handle the mariage of Prieſts in his abſence, they changed the order, and made the fourth ranke ſpeake next. <hi>Iohn <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,</hi> handling the ſeuenth Article of the degrees of affinitie and conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, paſſed immediatly from it, and came to the matter of diſpenſations, and ſeemed to haue none other aime, then to contradict Frier <hi>Adrian,</hi> labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to weaken the Popes power. Firſt hee expounded the places of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> That <hi>the Miniſters of</hi> CHRIST <hi>are the dispenſers of the myſteries of God, and of the Gospel,</hi> and ſaid the gloſſe was contrary to the text. For the place doth not prooue a diſpenſation, that is, a diſobligation from the Law, but a publiſhing and declaring the diuine myſteries, and the word of God, which is perpetuall, and remaineth inuiolable for euer. Hee granted, that in humane lawes a diſpenſation might lie, in regard of the law-makers imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, who could not foreſee all caſes, and, making generall lawes, muſt needes reſerue power to him that gouerneth the Common-wealth, becauſe of Sundrie occurrences, which may bring acceptions in particular matters. But where God is the Law-giuer, from whom nothing is concealed, and by whom no accident is not foreſeene, the law can haue no exception. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law of God and Nature ought not to be called a written Law, which in ſome caſes ought to bee expounded, and made more gentle, but all that Law is euen equitie it ſelfe. In humane lawes, in which ſome caſes by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of particular accidents, if they had been foreſeene, would not haue been comprehended, a diſpenſation may well bee granted. But the diſpencer cannot, in any caſe, free him that is bound, and if hee denie a diſpenſation to him that deſerueth it, the partie refuſed ſhall notwithſtanding remaine without all obligation. That the world hath conceiued a wrong opinion, that to diſpence, is to beſtow a fauour, and that the diſpenſation is requiſite to be giuen, as any other part of diſtributiue iuſtice to bee exerciſed; that the Prelate doth offend if hee giue it not to whom it is due. And, in ſumme, he ſaid, that when a diſpenſation is deſired, either the caſe is ſuch, as, if it had been foreſeene, it would haue been excepted, and here there is an obligation to diſpence, or would haue been comprehended, though it had been thought on by the Law-maker, and to this the power of diſpenſing is not extended. Hee added that flatterie, ambition, and auarice haue perſwaded, that to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is to beſtowe a fauour, as the maſter would doe to his ſeruants, or one that giueth of his owne. The Pope is not Lord, and the Church a ſeruant, but hee is ſeruant of him who is ſpouſe of the Church, and by him ſet ouer the Chriſtian familie, to giue, as the Goſpel ſaith, to euery one his owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that is, that which is due vnto him. And, in concluſion, hee ſaid, that a diſpenſation was nothing but a declaration or interpretation of the Law, and that the Pope could not, by diſpencing, vnbinde any that was bound, but declare onely to him that is not bound, that hee is exempted from the Law.</p>
            <p>The laſt day but one of February, the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> returned to <hi>Trent,</hi> hauing remained fiue dayes in <hi>Iſpruc,</hi> which hee ſent in continuall <note place="margin">The Card. of <hi>Loraine</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth.</note> negotiation With the Emperour, King of the Romans, and their Miniſters. At his returne he found the Popes letters to him; in which hee ſaid, that hee did deſire a reformation ſhould bee made and not deferred any longer, and
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:17208:348"/>
that they might haue time to labour therein, the words of the decree of <hi>Order,</hi> which were in difficultie, ſhould bee taken away. The Cardinall did publiſh theſe letters purpoſely in <hi>Trent,</hi> where it was generally knowen that the Legates had a contrary Commiſſion. But the Papalins vſed all diligence to find what buſineſſe the Cardinall had by meanes of thoſe who were in his company and in particular, what reſolution was taken concerning the ſeuenteene Articles; and the rather becauſe Count <hi>Fredericke Maſſei,</hi> who came from <hi>Ispruc</hi> but the day before related that the Cardinall was euery day in priuate conferrence, more then two houres, with the Emperour and King of the Romans. The Frenchmen made ſhow to vnderſtand nothing of the Articles, and ſaid that none of the Dutch diuines had treated with the Cardinall but <hi>Staphilus</hi> onely who preſented him with a booke which hee had made in matter of reſidence, and <hi>Caniſius</hi> when hee went to ſee the Colledge of the Ieſuites, that the Diuines had not ſpoken to the Emperour, but onely when going to ſee the Librarie, they ouertooke him and the King his ſonne, who demanding what they thought concerning the grant of the Cup the Abbat of <hi>Claneual,</hi> who was firſt of them, anſwered, that he thought it could not be granted; then the Emperour, turning to the King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, ſpake this verſe of the <hi>Pſalme</hi> in <hi>Latin; Fourtie yeeres haue I endured this generation, and haue alwayes found them to erre in their will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Loraine,</hi> in viſiting the Legates, ſaid nothing, but that the Emperour was very well and zealouſly affected towards the Counſel deſiring it might produce ſome fruit, and that if occaſion were, he would aſſiſt in perſon, and goe to <hi>Rome</hi> alſo, to pray the Pope to haue compaſſion of Chriſtendome, and to ſuffer a reformation to be made, which might not diminiſh his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to which he bare exceeding great reuerence nor would haue any thing ſpoken of touching his Holineſſe and the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> But to others in priuat he ſaid, that if the Councel had beene gouerned with that wiſedome as was conuenient, it would haue had a ſudden and proſperous end; that the Emperour was reſolued, that a good and a ſtrong reformation ſhould bee made, which if the Pope would continue to croſſe, as hitherto he had done, ſome great ſcandall would enſue, that his Maieſtie purpoſed to goe to <hi>Bolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> in caſe the Pope came thither, with deſſeigne to receiue the crowne of the Empire; and ſuch other things.</p>
            <p>It is not to bee doubted, that the Cardinall ſpake of the affaires of the <note place="margin">The points on which the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Emperour.</note> Councel, and informed the Emperour of the diſorders, and deliuered his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion what remedies might be vſed, to oppoſe the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Italian Prelates of <hi>Trent,</hi> to obtaine in Councel the communion of the Cup, the mariage of Prieſts, the vſe of the vulgar tongue in holy matters, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of other precepts of poſitiue law, a reformation in the Head and the members, and a meanes to make the Decrees of the Councel indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable, and how in caſe they were not able to obtaine, they might haue a colourable occaſion to iuſtifie their actions, if, of themſelues, they ſhould make prouiſion for the neceſſities of their people, by making a Nationall Councel, aſſaying alſo to vnite the Germans with the French-men, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion. But this was not his negotiation onely. For he treated a mariage alſo, betweene the Queene of <hi>Scotland</hi> and the Arch duke <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi>
               <pb n="678" facs="tcp:17208:349"/>
the Emperours ſonne, and another betweene a daughter of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie and the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and to find a meanes to compoſe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of precedence betweene <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> which things, as dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall, doe touch Princes more neerely then the publique.</p>
            <p>After the returne of <hi>Loraine</hi> the Congregations continuing, <hi>Iames Alan,</hi> a French Diuine, entred likewiſe into the matter of diſpenſations, and ſayd, that authority to diſpence was immediately giuen to the Church by Chriſt, and by it, diſtributed to the Prelates, as neede required, according to times, places, and occaſions. Hee extrolled the authority of Generall Councels, which repreſent the Church, and diminiſhed the Popes, adding that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the Generall councel to enlarge or reſtraine it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond of March, the Cardinall of <hi>Mantua,</hi> hauing beene ſicke a few, <note place="margin">The Cardinal of <hi>Mantua</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> daies, paſſed to another life; which was cauſe of many mutations in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. The Legates did preſently ſend aduice hereof to the Pope; and <hi>Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pando,</hi> who remained prime Legate, beſide the common letter, wrote in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that he would be glad his Holineſſe would ſend another Legate, his ſuperiour, to gouerne the Councel, or remooue him: but in caſe hee would <note place="margin">The three Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning write to the Pope.</note> leaue him prime Legate, he told him he would proceed as God ſhould inſpire him; and that otherwiſe it were better to remoue him abſolutely. The Cardinall of <hi>Varmia</hi> wrote a part alſo, that his Church had great neede of the preſence of a Paſtor, and that the communion of the Cup was brought in, and other notable abuſes, deſiring leaue to goe thither, to make prouiſion heerein, and that generally in all <hi>Polonia,</hi> there was neede of a perſon, who might keepe the reſidue of the people in obedience, ſaying, he ſhould doe the Apoſtolique Sea more ſeruice in thoſe quarters, then he could by remaining in the Councel. But <hi>Simoneta,</hi> deſirous that the weight of the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould lie vpon his ſhoulders; hoping to guide it with ſatisfaction of the Pope and his owne honour, conſidering that <hi>Seripando</hi> was ſatiated with it, and not inclined to gouerne it, and that <hi>Varmienſe</hi> was a ſimple man, fit to beled, he wrot to the Pope, that, the affaires of the Councel being not in a good ſtate, euery nouity would ſhake it much, and therefore did thinke fit to continue without ſending other Legates, and promiſed a good iſſue.</p>
            <p>In thoſe dayes aduice came from <hi>Rome,</hi> that a cauſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Sego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uia,</hi> which was to be propoſed in the <hi>Rota,</hi> was refuſed, and that one of the Auditors told his Proctor, that the Biſhop was ſuſpected of hereſie. This made a great ſtir, not onely amongſt the Spaniards, but all the <hi>Oltramontanes</hi> alſo, complaining that, in <hi>Rome,</hi> calumnies and infamies were raiſed againſt thoſe who did not abſolutely adhere to their wils.</p>
            <p>The fourth of March the third ranke beganne to ſpeake: and, for the fift Article all agreed that it was hereticall, and to be condemned; and ſo they did of the ſixt. Yet there was a difference, becauſe ſome ſaid, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Orientall Church and the Occidentall did differ, in regard this did admit to <hi>Prieſthood</hi> and holy <hi>Orders</hi> continent perſons onely, and that did admit maried men, yet no Church did euer grant that Prieſts might marie and that this is ſo by Apoſtolicall tradition, not by reaſon of vow, or of any Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution; and therefore that, abſolutely, they were to bee condemned for heretiques, who ſay it is lawfull for Prieſts to marie, though
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:17208:349"/>
they reſtraine not themſelues to the Weſt, nor make mention of vow or law of the Church. And others ſaid, that no diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> could bee granted for Prieſts to marry for any cauſe whatſoeuer. Some ſaid that matrimonie was forbidde to two ſorts of perſons, for two cauſes. To ſecular Clerkes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of holy <hi>Orders,</hi> by Eccleſiaſticall law; to regulars, in regard of their ſolemne vow. That the prohibition of mariage by conſtitution of the Church, may bee taken away by the Pope, or, in caſe that remaine in force ſtill, the Pope may diſpenſe with it. They alleadged the examples of thoſe who haue bene diſpenſed with, and the vſe of antiquitie, that, if a Prieſt did marry the mariage was good, but the man was ſeparated from the Miniſtery; which hath continually beene obſerued vntill the time of <hi>Innocenntius</hi> the 2. who, firſt of all the Popes, ordained that there ſhould bee a nullity in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. But with thoſe who are bound to continencie by ſolemne vow, this beeing <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> they ſaid the Pope could not diſpenſe. They alleadged <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, who affirmed that the obſeruation of chaſtity, and the abdication of the proprietie of goods, doth ſo cleaue to the bones of Munkes, that the Pope cannot diſpenſe therein. Then they added the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> and of other Doctors, who affirme, that the ſolemne vow is a conſecration of the man to God, and that, becauſe no man can make a thing conſecrated to returne to humane vſes, no man likewiſe can make a Munke to returne to the power of marrying, and that all Catholique Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe condemne <hi>Luther,</hi> and his ſectaries of hereſie, for ſaying that Munkſhip is an humane inuention; and doe affirme that it is by Apoſtolicall tradition: whereunto the opinion that the Pope may diſpenſe, is directly contrary.</p>
            <p>Others did maintaine that the Pope might diſpenſe, euen with theſe alſo, and marueiled at thoſe, who, granting the diſpenſation of ſimple vowes, did deny that of ſolemne, as if it were not most cleare, by the determination of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eigth, that euery ſolemnity is <hi>de iure poſitiuo,</hi> making vſe alſo of the examples of things conſecrated to prooue their opinion. For as a thing conſecrated, remaining ſo; cannot bee imployed in humane vſes, but yet the conſecration may bee remooued, and the thing made prophane, whereby it may lawfully returne to a promiſcuons vſe, ſo a man conſecrated to Munk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, remaining ſo, cannot marry, but, the Munkſhip and conſecration, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the ſolemnity of the vow, which is <hi>de iure poſitiuo,</hi> being remoued, hee may, without any hinderance, liue as others doe. They brought pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> by which it doth manifeſtly appeare, that in his time, ſome Munkes did marry. And howſoeuer it was thought they offended in it, yet the mariage was lawfull, and Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> reprehendeth thoſe who did ſeparate them.</p>
            <p>They ſaid moreouer it was neceſſary to diſpenſe with Prieſts, or to take away the precept of continencie. And the Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> hauing ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> to demaund of his Holineſſe the Communion of the Cup, requeſted alſo that married men might haue leaue to preach, vnder which name all the Eccleſiaſticall miniſtery was vnderſtood, exerciſed by Pariſh-Prieſts, in the cure of ſoules. Many reaſons were alleadged to perſwade the graunt, which were reſolued into two; ſcandall giuen by incontinens Prieſts, and
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:17208:350"/>
want of continent perſons, ſit to exerciſe the miniſterie. And the famous ſaying of Pope <hi>Pins</hi> the ſecond, was in the mouth of many that Prieſts were by the Occidentall Church forbid to marry for good reaſon, but there was ſtronger reaſon to reſtore mariage to them againe. Thoſe of the contrary opinion ſaid, that it is not the part of a wiſe Phyſician to cure one diſeaſe; by cauſing a greater, that if Prieſts are in continent and ignorant, yet the Prieſt-hood is not to bee proſtituted to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p>The Legates were blamed for ſuffering this Article to be diſputed; as being dangerous; becauſe it is plaine that married Prieſts will turne their affections <note place="margin">The principal reaſon why Prieſts are forbid to marry.</note> and loue to their wiues and children, and by conſequence to their houſe and Country, ſo that the ſtrict dependance which the Cleargie hath on the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> would ceaſe, and to grant mariage to Prieſts, would deſtroy the Eccleſiaſticall <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> and make the Pope to bee Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> onely. But the Legats excuſed themſelues, that, to pleaſe the Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> who had made this requeſt in the name of the Duke of <hi>Bauaria,</hi> and of the Emperor alſo, &amp; to make the Imperialiſts not to be ſo earneſt in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reformation, which was of more importance, they were forced to yeeld to this diſputation.</p>
            <p>The French-men, perceiuing it was the more common opinion that the mariage of Prieſts might bee diſpenſed with, conſulted together whether it were fit to demaund a diſpenſation for the Cardinall of <hi>Borbon,</hi> as <hi>Loraine</hi> and the Ambaſſadours had commiſſion. <hi>Loraine</hi> was of opinion, that it was not fit; ſaying, that, without doubt, the Councell would hardly be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the cauſe was reaſonable, and vrgent, in regard it was not neceſſary he ſhould haue poſterity, the King being young, there being two Brothers, and other Princes of the blood, Catholikes: and for gouerning, during the minoritie of the King; hee might doe it, remaining in the Cleargie, that, in regard of the differences betweene the French and Italians, about reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the authoritie of the Pope and Biſhops, their oppoſities would dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently oppoſe this demaund; that it was better to go to the Pope, or expect a better occaſion, and that it was ſufficient for that time, to prouide that no doctrine ſhould be eſtabliſhed in preiudice of it. Some thought that <hi>Loraine</hi> did not like, in his priuate opinion, that <hi>Borbon</hi> ſhould marry, in regard it might cauſe an emulation, or diminution of his houſe; but others did not thinke it probable.

               </gap> 
               <hi>France,</hi> and that, if a Patriarke were made, as hee much deſired, hee

might vndoubtedly be the man, which could not bee, if <hi>Borbon</hi> did ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the Cleargie.</p>
            <p>The Pope hauing receiued aduice of the death of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and conſulted with his inward friends, thought it neceſſary to ſend other Legats, who be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing new, not intangled with promiſes and treaties, might follow his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions with more eaſe. And therefore the ſeuenth of March, the ſecond Sunday in Lent, not intimating a Congregation, as hee was wont, but the <note place="margin">Two new Legates are created.</note> Cardinals being aſſembled in the Chamber where they put on their robes to goe to the Chappell, according to the vſe, hee ſtayed, and, excluding the Courtiers, cauſed the doores to bee ſhut, and created Legats, the Cardinals, <hi>Iohn Morone,</hi> and <hi>Bernardus Nauaggerus,</hi> that, by the perſwaſions of Princes or Cardinals, he might not bee forced to name others that pleaſed him not. The Pope thought to doe it ſecretly; but it came to the eares of the French-men, and the Cardinall of <hi>Bordiſsiera</hi> ſpake to the Pope before hee went out of the Chamber, and told him many reaſons, that, in caſe hee would create new Legats, hee could not commit the charge to a more worthy perſon then the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine.</hi> But the Pope being reſolute, and diſpleaſed that the matter was not ſo ſecretly carried, anſwered freely, that the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> came to the Councell as Head of one of the pretendent parties, and that he would depute thoſe who were Neutrals, and without intereſts. The Cardinall being about to reply, the Pope made haſte away, and went downe out of the Chamber ſo faſt, that there was not time to make anſwere. The Congregation being ended, the Pope let the Cardinals goe to the Chappell, and himſelfe returned to the Chamber, becauſe hee would not bee in cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, when he was ſo much vexed with the words of that Cardinall.</p>
            <p>The ninth of March newes came to <hi>Trent,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> is ſlains vnder <hi>Orli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
               </note> to the Cardinal of <hi>Loraine,</hi> as he returned from the trenches vnder <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lience,</hi> was ſhot, by <hi>Iohn Poltrot,</hi> a priuat Gentleman of the reformed religion, and ſixe dayes after died, to the great diſcontent of all the Court, and that, after he was wounded, he exhorted the Queene to make peace, and ſaid open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he was an enemie to the kingdome who was againſt it. The Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide being interrogated of his complices, named <hi>Coligni,</hi> the Admirall, and <hi>Theodore Beza,</hi> and afterwards excuſed <hi>Beza,</hi> but perſeuered in accuſing the other. Yet hee wauered ſo, that one could not tell what to beleeue. The Cardinall aduertiſed hereof, prouided a greater guard then formerly hee had: and, being exceedingly grieued for the death of his brother, who was ſo deare vnto him, firſt of all hee wrote a conſolatorie Letter to <hi>Antoniette de</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Card. of <hi>Loraine</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to his mother.</note> 
               <hi>Borbon,</hi> their common mother, full of exquiſite conceits, to bee compared, or rather as his friends ſaid, to bee preferred to thoſe of <hi>Seneca,</hi> in the end whereof hee ſaid, hee was reſolued to goe to his Church of <hi>Reims,</hi> and to ſpend the reſidue of his life in preaching the word of GOD, inſtructing the people, bringing vp his brothers children in Chriſtian pietie, and neuer to ceaſe performing of theſe offices, but when the Kingdome, for ſome publike affaires, had need of his paines. The Letter was no ſooner parted from <hi>Trent,</hi> but the Citie was full of copies of it, rather importunely offered by his friends, then requeſted; ſo hard it is for the affection of ſelfe loue to bee quiet, though in the occaſion of greateſt ſorrow. After this, the Cardinall,
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:17208:351"/>
thinking of the change of things by this variation, altered all his deſſeignes. And this cauſed a change alſo in the affaires of the Councell. For hee being the man which the Emperour and Queene of <hi>France</hi> had, vntill then, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed, they were forced, for want of ſo fit a miniſter, to bee more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe in their purpoſes, and to proceed more ſlowly. But it happeneth in humane affaires, as it doeth in fortunes at Sea, where, the windes being cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the waues doe tumultuate, for ſome houres after. So the great weight of the affaires of the Councell could not eaſily be appeaſed, in regard of their former impetuous motion. But it is certaine, that the death of that Duke <note place="margin">The death of the Duke cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the Councell.</note> was a great beginning of the quiet which ſucceeded ſome moneths after, eſpecially after the death of the other brother, great <hi>Prior</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the peace made with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and the inſtances of the Queene to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall to make his peace with the Pope, and returne into <hi>France:</hi> of which things wee will ſpeake in due place. Hereby the Cardinall ſaw, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires as they ſtood, would not bee profitable, neither for himſelfe, nor his friends.</p>
            <p>The death of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was lamented both in <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe euery one thought hee was the onely maintainer of the Catholique partie in the kingdome of <hi>France;</hi> neither did it appeare what other perſon could ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, in ſupporting that weight; the rather, becauſe euery one was daunted by the example of his death. The French Prelats in the Councell were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in minde, becauſe they vnderſtood that an accord was treated with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> who pretended, amongſt other things, that the third part of the Eccleſiaſticall reuenues ſhould bee employed for maintenance of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Miniſters.</p>
            <p>In this varietie of buſineſſes, and perplexitie of mindes, <hi>Fiue-Churches</hi> returned to <hi>Trent,</hi> and, with the other Ambaſſadours of the Emperour, had audience with the Legats, and preſented to them the Emperours letter which <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours letters to the Legats and the Pope.</note> hee brought, and the copy of another written by his Maieſtie to the Pope. They all made requeſt for the reformation, but in generall termes onely, and very remiſſely. The Emperours letter to the Legats, did ſignifie his deſire to ſee ſome fruitfull proceeding of the Councell, for which it was neceſſary to remooue ſome impediments, whereof hauing written to the Pope, he prayed them to labour in Councell, and to vſe perſwaſions to his Holineſſe, that the future progreſſe might be for the ſeruice of GOD, and benefite of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. In his letter to the Pope hee ſaid, that, hauing diſpatched great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes with the <hi>Electors,</hi> and other Princes and States of <hi>Germanie,</hi> nothing was more precious vnto him, being <hi>Aduocate</hi> of the Church, then to promote the affaires of the Councell; that hee was come to <hi>Iſpruc</hi> for that cauſe, where, to his griefe, he vnderſtood that matters did not proceed as he hoped, and as the publike tranquillitie did require; that hee feared, if better order wer not taken, the Councell would end with ſcandall of the world, and laughter of thoſe who had forſaken the obedience of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who would bee incited to retaine their opinions with greater obſtinacie, there had beene no Seſſion held of a long time; that while Princes did la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to vnite the aduerſaries differing in opinions, the Fathers came to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, vnworthy of them; that there was a fame that his Holineſſe meant
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:17208:351"/>
to diſſolue or ſuſpend the Councell, perhaps mooued thereunto by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate thereof: but that his opinion was to the contrary. For it had beene better it had neuer beene begun, then left vnperfect with the ſcandall of the world, contempt of his Holineſſe, and of the whole Clergie, preiudice of this and other future generall Councels, loſſe of that ſmall remainder of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, and opinion of the world, that the end of the diſſolution or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion was onely to hinder the reformation; that, in the intimation of it, his Holineſſe did deſire his conſent, and of other Kings and Princes, which he did, in imitation of his predeceſſors, who alwayes haue thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for many reſpects; that the ſame reaſon doth conclude, that it cannot be diſſolued or ſuſpended without the ſame conſent. And he exborted him, not to hearken to thoſe who would haue him to diſſolue it, a thing ſhamefull and vnprofitable, which vndoubtedly would be a cauſe of Nationall Councels, ſo much abhorred by his Hol. as contrary to the vnity of the Church, which as they haue been hindred by Princes to preſerue the Popes authoritie, ſo they cannot be denyed, or deferred any more. Hee perſwaded him to maintaine the libertie of the Councell, which was impeached principally by three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. One becauſe euery thing was firſt conſulted of at <hi>Rome,</hi> another, becauſe the Legats had aſſumed to themſelues onely the libertie of propoſing, which ought to be common to all; the third, becauſe of the practiſes which ſome Prelats, intereſted in the greatneſſe of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> did make. He ſaid, that a reformation of the Church being neceſſary, and the common opinion being, that the abuſes haue their beginning and growth in <hi>Rome,</hi> it was fit, for common ſatisfaction, that the reformation ſhould bee made in Councell, and not in that Cittie. And therefore deſired his Holineſſe to be content that the demands exhibited by his Ambaſſadours, and by other Princes, might be propoſed. In the concluſion, he told him, hee purpoſed to aſſiſt in Councell perſonally, and exhorted his Holineſſe to doe the like.</p>
            <p>This letter was diſpatched the third of March, and it gaue much offence <note place="margin">With which his Holineſſe is offended.</note> to the Pope. For hee thought that the Emperour did embrace much more then his authoritie did reach vnto, and paſſed the termes of his Predeceſſors, men more potent then himſelfe. But he was diſpleaſed more when hee was aduiſed by his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> that hee had ſent copies of the ſame Letter to other Princes, and to the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> alſo; which could bee done to no other end, but to incite them againſt him, and to iuſtifie his owne actions.

            <p>The Pope thought that the intereſts of the Emperor and of <hi>France</hi> could not be vnited with his, and therefore could promiſe himſelfe but little, and hope leſſe of them. For they did not thinke of the Synode but for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of their eſtates, &amp; therefore did deſire nothing from it but what might giue ſatisfaction and contentment to their people, and in caſe they cannot obtaine it, to hinder the ending of the Councell, and ſo to keepe their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects ſtill in hope. But theſe intereſts could not mooue the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whoſe people are Catholikes, and therefore he might conforme himſelfe to his wil, without preiudice to his ſtates, yea that it was good for him to ſtand vnited with him, that he might obtaine graces; and therefore he thought it neceſſarie to ſolicite him, with continuall perſwaſions, and to giue him hope of all ſatisfaction. And <hi>Lewis d' Auola</hi> did opportunely arriue in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſent expreſly by his Catholike Maieſtie. The Pope honoured him aboue meaſure, lodged him in the palace, in the roomes formerly inhabited by Count <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric</hi>

The cauſes of his comming were, to obtaine of the Pope a prorogation for fiue yeeres more of the Subſidie of the Cleargie, graunted vnto him, and power to ſell fiue and twentie thouſand crownes of the Fees of the Churches. Hee had commiſſion alſo to procure a diſpenſation of marriage betweene the Princeſſe, Siſter of the King and his Sonne <hi>Charles,</hi> which, in <hi>Spaine,</hi> was thought eaſie, becauſe many, euen priuate men, were diſpenſed with to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the daughter of their brother or ſiſter, which is as much as to take the ſiſter of the father, Beſides, <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were borne of ſuch a matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie. For the mariage, the Pope ſaid he would doe as much as his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie would ſtretch vnto, and would cauſe the matter to be conſulted on. But the Treatie did not proceede, in regard of the infirmitie of the Princeſſe which ſucceeded, and made her vnfit for marriage. Concerning the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidie, and alienation, the Pope ſhewed a willing minde, but made difficulty to doe it while the Prelates were at charges in the Councell, promiſing to gratifie the King if hee would aſſiſt him to finiſh it, and to free him from it.

For matters of the Councell, <hi>Don Lewis</hi> did not proceed farre in the firſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences, onely he offered to procure the preſeruation of the Popes authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and exhorted his Holineſſe not to treat a league betweene the Catholikes, leaſt the heretickes ſhould doe the like, and <hi>France</hi> runne headlong to any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the <hi>Hugonots.</hi>

            <p>In the meane while diuers aſſemblies were held in <hi>Trent:</hi> the Emperours Ambaſſadours called together the Spaniſh Prelates, in the houſe of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Granata,</hi> to perſwade them to conſent that the vſe of the Cup might be granted in Councell, purpoſing to propoſe it againe: but they found them ſo auerſe, that they were forced to bury it in ſilence. The Cardinall of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> held many congregations with his Prelats and Diuines to examine the places, ſent by the Pope to the Emperour, in the paper before mentioned, and by the Emperour to him, concerning the words, <hi>Vniuerſalem Eccleſiam,</hi> to ſee whether they were iuſtly cited, and whether the true ſence was giuen them, that they might, as they did, make another writing, in confutation of it. The Emperour gaue order that theſe places might bee imparted to the Spaniſh Prelates, that he might know their opinion; which <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> hauing done, when they were all aſſembled to this ende, <hi>Granata</hi> anſwered that his Maieſtie needed not to haue taken ſuch paines with them who doe receiue the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> but ſhould aske the French-men, who receiue that of <hi>Baſil.</hi> Vpon this occaſion ſome of them, when <hi>Fiue Churches</hi> was gone from them, did perſwade, that a letter ſhould bee written to the Pope, to take from him the bad opinion hee had conceiued of them. But <hi>Granata</hi> refuſed, and ſaid, it was ſufficient that hee knew by their voyces that they were not oppoſite heerein; yet ſo, as it was not fit they ſhould imitate the flatterie of the <hi>Italians.</hi> And hee vſed theſe very words. <hi>Let him reſtore vnto vs our owne, that wee may leaue vnto him more then is his; and it is not iuſt, that of Biſhops wee ſhould bee made his Vicars.</hi> Another day the Ambaſſadours of the Emperour and French King met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to ſet downe an order that the Decree of reſidence, compoſed by the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> might bee propoſed: which neither they, nor <hi>Loraine</hi> could obtaine of the Cardinal of <hi>Varmia,</hi> and <hi>Simoneta, Seripando</hi> being ſicke, and abſent.</p>
            <p>In the congregation of the ſeuenteenth of March, one of the Diuines, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding opportunitie to digreſſe from the continencie of Prieſtes to reſidence, ſpent his whole large diſcourſe therein. Hee brought authoritie and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to perſwade that it was <hi>de iure diuino,</hi> and to anſwere that obiection, that many Canons and Decrees doe command it, which needed not, if it were commanded by God. Hee vſed this conceit, that <hi>Ius diuinum</hi> is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or pillar of reſidence, and <hi>Ius Canonicum</hi> the Edifice or roofe, and that as the building is ouerthrowne when the foundation is remooued, and as the roofe falleth when the pillar is taken away, ſo it is impoſſible to preſerue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence with <hi>Ius Canonicum</hi> onely, and thoſe who aſcribe it onely vnto that, haue no other ayme then to deſtroy it. Hee brought the examples of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, noting that reſidence was exquiſitely obſerued by all, before any Canons or humane Decrees were made, becauſe euery one held that hee was bound by God. But ſince that ſome haue perſwaded themſelues, that

he was not pleaſed it ſhould haue licenſe, nor be in ſeruitude to thoſe Princes, who preach liberty, and are deſirous to command, that euery one made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to him for the libertie of the Councell, but hee did not know whether they had all well conſidered of what importance it would bee, if the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates had the raines laid on the necke; that howſoeuer there were amongſt them, ſome men excellent for integrity and wiſedome, yet there were of thoſe alſo, who wanted either one of them or both; all which would bee dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous if they were not kept in order, that perhaps it did leaſt of all concerne him to thinke of it, becauſe, his authority being grounded vpon the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God, hee did truſt in thoſe; that Princes had more neede to beware, in regard of the preiudices which may enſue, and that, if the Prelates had ſuch ſuperfluous liberty, perhaps his Catholique Maieſtie would haue cauſe to bee ſorie for it, that, for reformation, the impediments did not proceede from him; that he would continue to deferre the demands of Princes concerning the communion of the Cup, and mariage of Prieſts, deſiring his Maieſtie to conſider, that as hee diſſented from others in theſe particulars, ſo in euery thing elſe there are ſome who make requeſts for it, and others who oppoſe.

But, conſidering that the French-men and Spaniards would oppoſe, and that greater controuerſies might be raiſed then euer were, and that if they ſhould propoſe the abuſes onely, they ſhould giue the Emperours and French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours fit occaſion to enter againe into the matter of reformation, they were much perplexed what to doe. <hi>

               </gap> of the troubles which ſhall be related hereafter.</p>
            <p>The newes was now ſtale in <hi>Trent,</hi> of the inſtance made in <hi>Rome</hi> to the Pope. For the Emperours Ambaſſadours and the French, had publiſhed it ſhould be done, and that afterwards they would make the ſame requeſts to the Councel. The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> who was wont to ſpeake variouſly, ſaid, that if thoſe Princes did receiue ſatisfaction, by propoſing their petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of reformation, and the reformation made, without diminution of the Popes authority, thoſe inſtances would immediatly ceaſe. And hee added afterwards, that the Pope might haue a good proceeding in the reformation, and a quicke diſpatch of the Councel, if hee would declare himſelfe plainely what points hee would not haue to bee diſcuſſed, that they might labour in diſcuſſing the others; by which meanes the contentions would be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, which haue cauſed all the delayes. For ſome, who deſire to ſhew their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to his Holineſſe, ſuppoſing that a part of thoſe petitions may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall to the Apoſtolique Sea, doe oppoſe them all: and others, denying that any of them doe preiudice, doe cauſe the buſineſſe to bee drawen in length. But if his Holineſſe would declare himſelfe, the difficulties would ceaſe. The Emperours Ambaſſadours gaue a copie to many in <hi>Trent,</hi> of his Maieſties letter to the Pope; which made the Legates reſolue to ſpread alſo the copie of the letter which themſelues had written in anſwere to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, when hee ſent them that which hee had written to the Pope; which letter beeing compoſed according to the inſtructions ſent from <hi>Rome,</hi> did containe the ſame conceipts, as the letters of his Holineſſe did.</p>
            <p>The Pope, comparing the propoſitions of all the Ambaſſadours with the ſpeech of <hi>Loraine,</hi> whereof aduice was ſent him, was ſo much the more reſolute, not to conſent to the propoſitions of reformation, made by the French-men. And indeed, not onely a perſon of a great ſpirit, and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the world, as the Pope was, but euery meane capacitie might diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the cunning vſed, to draw him into the net, in caſe he had not beene wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. He conſidered, that to ſay he ſhould declare which of the petitions did not pleaſe him, did ſignifie nothing but that, by ſuffering the others to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, hee ſhould leaue a way wide open to bring in the others afterwards, which were to his preiudice. And who could doubt that to obtaine the firſt would not bee an end, but a degree to paſſe to that at which they aymed; and that to releaſe the Eccleſiaſticall precepts, belonging to thrites, as the communion of the Cup, marriage of Prieſts, vſe of the Latin tongue, which ſeeme, at the firſt view, not to derogate from the Popes authoritie, would notwithſtanding cauſe immediatly a totall deſtruction of the foundations of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Some things make a faire ſhew, and ſeeme that they may bee admitted without loſſe; but a wiſe man muſt conſider the concluſion of things, rather then their beginning. Being therefore reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſtop theſe firſt paſſages, and conſidering what other remedies there might bee, hee returned to his firſt cogitations, that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> had neither intereſt; nor any affection to proſecute the inſtances made, that the Emperor and French men did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>bour in them, hoping by this meane<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to ſatisfie their people, and to appeaſe the diſcords; not knowing that the
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:17208:355"/>
heretikes doe inculcate the reformation that they may haue a pretence for their ſeparation from the Church, and would not bee reduced though it ſhould be made. Hee thought therefore, that if the Princes were made to vnderſtand this, they would abandon their inſtance, and ſuffer the Councell to end quietly. Wherefore he wholely bent his endeuours to ouercome the difficulties, by this meanes. And conſidering well all reſpects, he thought it more eaſie to perſwade the Emperor, who could determine of him ſelfe, and was of a more gentle and ſweete diſpoſition, farre from any cunning, and not intangled with warre, whereas in <hi>France,</hi> the King being a child, many that were partakers in the gouernment, vſing many artifices, and hauing diuers intereſts, it would be very hard to doe any good. Where-vpon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued that Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> before he entred into the affayres of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, ſhould goe to the Emperour for this end. And remembring what <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Pope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolueth to ſend Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Morone</hi> to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</note> ſaid in <hi>Trent,</hi> that the Emperour would goe to <hi>Bolonia</hi> to receiue the Crowne, he reſolued to try whether he could induce that Cardinall to bee a mediatour herein, and ſo to tranſlate the Councell to that Citie. He gaue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Biſhop of <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> to inſinuate with him, and to perſwade <note place="margin">And hath a plot vpon the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine.</hi>
               </note> him to it; and, to giue him a meanes of entrance, he cauſed <hi>Boromeo</hi> to giue him commiſſion, to condole with him, for the death of his brother the great Prior.</p>
            <p>But before this order came, the Cardinall was gone for <hi>Padua.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop therefore conferring with <hi>Simoneta,</hi> concluded that the importance of the matter did not admit any loſſe of time, nor could bee negotiated but in preſence. Wherefore he reſolued to follow him, pretending to ſee a Nephew of his, who was very ſicke in <hi>Padua.</hi> Being come thither, hee viſited the Cardinall, preſented the letters of <hi>Boromeo,</hi> and condoled with him making no ſhew of any other buſineſſe. Talking together, the Cardinall demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what newes there was in <hi>Trent,</hi> ſince his departure, and whether Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Morone</hi> would goe to the Emperour, as was reported. After many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes on both ſides, the Biſhop began to put him in minde that his <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie</hi> had formerly told him in <hi>Trent,</hi> that, in caſe the Pope would go to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> the Emperour would goe thither alſo, and would make it an occaſion to receiue the Crowne, which would turne to the great aduantage of his Holineſſe to maintaine the poſſeſſion of coronation, which <hi>Germanie</hi> did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne. The Cardinall affirming this againe, the B. added, that hee had then ſent aduiſe therof to <hi>Rome,</hi> and now had receiued an anſwer by which he did conclude that a very faire occaſion was preſented to his <hi>Excellencie</hi> of doing much good to the Church of GOD, by labouring to bring ſo profitable a diſſeigne to effect. For in caſe he could perſwade his Maieſtie to go to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> calling alſo the Councell thither, he might aſſure himſelfe that his Holineſſe would reſolue to be there likewiſe, and that, by the aſſiſtance of them both, the affaires of the Synod would haue a quicke diſpatch, and a happy ſucceſſe. The Cardinall deſired to ſee what was written to him; and the Biſhop, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king demonſtration to proceede freely with him, ſhewed him the letters of Cardinall <hi>Boromeo,</hi> and a writing of <hi>Ptolemeus Gallus;</hi> the Popes Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretarie.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall hauing read all, anſwered, that at his returne to <hi>Trent,</hi> bot
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:17208:356"/>
ſhould better vnderſtand the Emperors mind, and what anſwere the Pope had ſent to his Maieſtie, whereby hee might reſolue better, and would not faile to beſtow his paines, if there were occaſion. The Biſhop replying, that he might plainely vnderſtand the Popes mind, by the letters which he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and that there was no cauſe to expect better information, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall entred into other diſcourſes, neither could the Biſhop, though he often returned to the ſame matter, draw any other anſwere from him. Hee ſayd indeed, that the Emperour had ſpoken of his going to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> becauſe the Pope had told him of his purpoſe to make the reformation; but ſeeing that it is now plaine, by long experience, that howſoeuer his Holineſſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth many things, yet nothing is executed in Councell, his Maieſtie and other Princes do beleeue, that hee hath no true meaning of performance, and that, otherwiſe, the Legates would not haue failed to haue executed his will. Hee ſayd the Emperour was not ſatisfied, for that the Pope hauing, in Ianuary, ſhewed a purpoſe to go to <hi>Bolonia,</hi> was cooled on the ſudden, and that when his Maieſtie told him of of his deſire to aſſiſt perſonally in Councel, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe laboured much to diſwade him, vſing his wonted varietie of ſpeeches. He ſaid alſo that the Emperour would not reſolue to goe into <hi>Bolonia,</hi> leſt he ſhould diſpleaſe the Princes, who might doubt; that when he was there his Holineſſe would gouerne all after his owne manner, &amp; conclude the Synode as he liſted, without making any reformation. He ſaid he had receiued aduiſe of the inſtance, made by <hi>Don Lewis d' Auila</hi> in the name of the Catholique King, and was glad to heare it. And ſpeaking at large of the particulars, hee added, that it was neceſſarie it ſhould bee performed, euen from <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> to <hi>Omega,</hi> and that it was fit to remooue from the Councell fiftie Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops at the leaſt, who doe alwayes oppoſe all good reſolutions. Hee ſayd that formerly he thought there were more abuſes in <hi>France,</hi> then elſe where, but now he knew that there were enough in <hi>Italy</hi> alſo. For the Churches are in the hands of Cardinals, who, ayming at profit onely, doe wholly aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, and leaue the cure to a poore Prieſt; by which meanes the Churches are ruined, and Simonies, and an infinitie of other diſorders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. For remedie whereof, the Princes and their miniſters did proceed moderately, hoping that, at the laſt, the deſired reformation would be made.

That his familie had ſuffered, as euery one knoweth, the loſſe of two brothers; that himſelfe would ſpend his blood in the ſame cauſe, though not in Armes, as they did; that his Holineſſe ought not to hearken to thoſe who would diuert him from ſo pious an intention, but to reſolue to obtaine a reward at the hands of GOD, by the merit of remouing the abuſes of the Church. Hee ſayd alſo, that, when the new Legates came, who no doubt would be well informed of the Popes minde; it would hee knowne what his purpoſe was concerning the reformation, in regard they could haue no cauſe to delay it, if they meant to make it at all.

Hee viſited the Legats, vſing many louing words, and generall offers.</p>
            <p>The thirteenth of Aprill there was a congregation, to receiue Cardinall <note place="margin">Card. <hi>Morone</hi> is receiued in congregation</note> 
               <hi>Morone,</hi> where, after the <hi>Briefe</hi> of his Legation was read, hee made a ſpeech, fit for the occaſion, and ſaid, that the warres, ſeditions, and other calamities, preſent, and imminent, for our ſinnes, would ceaſe, if a meanes were found to appeaſe GOD, and to reſtore the ancient puritie, for which and the Pope had, with great iudgement, aſſembled the Councell, in which are two Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, Princes, famous for nobilitie and vertue, Ambaſſadours of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and of ſo many great Kings, Princes, free Cities and Nations, and Prelats of excellent learning and integretie, and moſt skilfull Diuines. But, <hi>Mantus</hi> and <hi>Seripando</hi> being dead, the Pope had ſubſtituted him, and ioyned <hi>Nauaggero</hi> with him, which he had refuſed, knowing the weight of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and the weakeneſſe of his ſtrength. But the neceſſitie of obedience hath ouer come feare, that he was commanded to goe to the Emperour; and would returne ſhortly, to treat with the Fathers, in company of the other Legates, that which doth concerne the ſaluation of the people, the honour of the Church, and the glory of CHRIST; that hee brought with him two things one, a good meaning of the Pope to ſecure the doctrine of faith, to correct bad manners, to prouide for the neceſſities of Prouinces, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh peace and vnion, euen with the aduerſaries, as much as pietie and the dignitie of the Apoſtolique <hi>Sea</hi> can permit the other, his owne readines, to doe what his Holineſſe hath commanded him. He prayed the Fathers, that contentious and diſcord; and vnprofitable queſtions being layd a ſide, which doe grieouſly offend Chriſtendom, they would handle ſeriouſly the things that are neceſſarie.</p>

               <hi>Morone</hi> was willing to ſee <hi>Loraine,</hi> before he went to the Emperour, who becauſe hee would not ſpeake with him, deferred his returne. For hauing ſpoken in <hi>

He had charge alſo to pray him to maintaine the authoritie of the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> againſt all the plots, made to diminiſh it, or rather to bring it to nothing; and that the reformation of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> might not be made in <hi>Trent,</hi> but by the Pope himſelfe; that no mention might bee made of renewing the things determined vnder <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iulius,</hi> in the ſame Councell, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie would bee content, that the Decrees ſhould bee made in Councell, by the propoſition of the Legates onely, firſt imparting them, and hauing the conſent of the Ambaſſadours of his Maieſtie and of other Princes.

            <p>The 20. of Aprill <hi>Loraine</hi> returned, and was met by the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of the Emperour, of <hi>Polonia,</hi> and of <hi>Sauoy;</hi> and the ſame day newes came of the peace concluded by the French King with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> which was more for the aduantage of the Catholique party.

That, in euery Bayliweeke, an houſe ſhall bee appointed, in the Suburbs, in which the reformed religion may be exerciſed, by all of that iuriſdiction. That eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one may liue in his owne houſe without being enquired into, or moleſted for his conſcience. That in all Cities, where that religion hath beene exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed vntill the ſeuenth of March, it ſhall bee continued in one or two places of that citie, ſo that the Catholike Churches be not taken for that vſe, which alſo ſhall be reſtored to the Eccleſiaſtiques, in caſe they haue beene ſurpriſed by them, yet ſo as that they ſhall not pretend any thing for demolitions made. That, in the Citie and Precincts of <hi>Paris,</hi> there ſhall bee no exerciſe of that religion, but thoſe who haue houſes or reuenues there, may returne and enioy them, without being moleſted for matters either paſt or to come, concerning their conſciences. That all ſhall repoſſeſſe their goods, honors, and offices, notwithſtanding the ſentences to the contrary, and executions of them, ſince the death of <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſecond vntill now. That the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and all his followers ſhall be ſaid to haue a good end and intention, for the ſeruice of the King. That all priſoners of warre, or iuſtice, for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of religion, ſhall freely be ſet at libertie. That an obliuion of things paſt ſhall be publiſhed, and iniuring and prouoking one another, as alſo diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and contending about religion ſhall be forbid, and that they ſhall liue as brothers, friends, and fellow Citizens. This accord was eſtabliſhed the twelfth of March, to the diſcontentment of <hi>Colignie,</hi> who ſayd, their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires were not in ſtate to make ſuch aduantagious conditions. That it was propoſed vnto him in the beginning of the warre, to make peace with the Edict of Ianuary, and now that they might require more aduantage, the conditions were worſe. To ſay that in euery Bayliweeke there ſhall be one place for the exerciſe of religion, is to take away all from GOD, and to giue him a portion. But the common inclination of all the Nobility did force him to be content. Concerning theſe conditions the Kings letters were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, the nineteenth of the ſame moneth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in which it was ſayd; That it hauing pleaſed God to permit, for ſome yeeres, the kingdome to be afflicted with ſeditions and tumults, raiſed for matter of religion, for which cauſe armes were taken, with infinite ſlaughters, ſacking of cities, ruines of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and now, by continuance of the euill, hauing experience that warre is not the proper remedie for this maladie, the King hath thought fit to reunite his Subiects in good peace, truſting that time, and the fruit of an holy, free, generall, or Nationall Councell will eſtabliſh the ſame. And heere the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, concerning religion, were added, beſides the others in matters of State:
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:17208:358"/>
which letters were publiſhed, and regiſtred in Court of Parliament, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely proclaimed in <hi>Paris,</hi> the ſeuen and twentieth of the ſame moneth.</p>
            <p>This was blamed by the greater part of the Fathers in Councell, who ſaid it was to preferre the things of the world, before the things of GOD, yea to ruine both the one and the other. For the foundation of a ſtate, which is religion, being remoued, it is neceſſarie that the temporall ſhould come to deſolation; whereof the Edict made before was an example, which did not cauſe peace and tranquillitie, as was hoped, but a greater warre then before. And ſome of the Prelats did dare to ſay, that the King and the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell had incurred the excommunications of many <hi>Decretals,</hi> and Bulls, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen peace to the heretikes; and that there was no hope that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of that Kingdome would proſper, where there is a manifeſt diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> vntill the King and the Councel did cauſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee abſolued from the cenſures, and did perſecute the heretikes with all their forces. In defence whereof the French-men ſaide, that the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, continually ſupported by all <hi>France,</hi> and the manifeſt danger of the ruine of the Kingdome did ſufficiently iuſtifie this action againſt the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of thoſe, who, regarding onely their owne intereſts, doe not conſider the neceſſitie in which the King was, which is more potent then any law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> alleadging that of <hi>Romulus,</hi> that the good of the people is the moſt principall law of all. But theſe reaſons were not eſteemed, and the King was blamed aboue all, becauſe hee ſaid in the proheme, that the time, and the fruite of an holy, free, generall or Nationall Councell would cauſe the eſtabliſhment of tranquillitie; which they ſayde was an iniurie to the generall Councell, to bee put in alternation with a Nationall, and that the Cardinalls of <hi>Borbon,</hi> and of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſhould bee named amongſt the Authours of the Councell to make peace, ſaying it was a great iniurie to the Apoſtolique <hi>Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Synode beganne alſo to bee troubled amongſt themſelues, for a ſmall cauſe, which did giue much matter of diſcourſe. Friar <hi>Peter Sota</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">The letter of <hi>Soto</hi> to the Pope.</note> this time, and three dayes before his death, did dictate and ſubcribe a letter to bee ſent to the Pope, in which, by way of confeſſion, he declared his opinion concerning the points controuerted in Councell, and did particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary exhort his Holineſſe to conſent, that reſidence, and the inſtitution of Biſhops might bee declared to bee <hi>de iure diuino.</hi> The letter was ſent to the Pope, and Friar <hi>Ludouicus Sotus,</hi> his companion, kept a copie of it; who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to honour the memorie of his friend, begann to ſpread it. This cauſed much ſpeach. Some were mooued with the action of a doctour of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt life, and at the time of his death. Others ſaide he did it not by his owne motion, but at the inſtigation of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Braganza. Simoneta</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to get in all the copies; which did increaſe curioſitie, and made them publiſhed the more, ſo that they were in the hands of all. And it is certaine that the maintainers of theſe opinions were incouraged by this accident. The Spaniards did often meete in the houſe of the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> where <hi>Granata</hi> informed him of the preſent and paſt occurrences of the Councell; and, the Biſhops of <hi>Leria,</hi> and <hi>Patti</hi> being departed, he ſaide, theſe are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne men, who, like to animals, ſuffer the burthen to be laid vpon them, and
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:17208:359"/>
themſelues to bee gouerned by the will and opinion of another, who are good for nothing but to make a number: adding, that if in their reſolutions they proceeded by number of voyces, as hitherto they had done, little good could bee hoped for; and that it was neceſſary that matters ſhould bee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by way of Nations. The Count ſaid, it was neceſſary to prouide for that and many other things, beginning from the reuocation of the Decree that the Legates onelymay propoſe, and from eſtabliſhing the liberty of the Councell; for which things hee had ſpeciall commiſſion from the King; which being well ſetled, the reſidue would bee prouided for with eaſe. The Legats and other Papalins were diſpleaſed to ſee that the Spaniards, their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſits, did neuer go from the Count: and as it happeneth when oneentreth new in a place where are contrarie factions, euery one hopeth to gaine him, the Legats alſo did ſtriue to put him on the ſide of the Prelats the Kings Subiects, whom they called their well-willers, becauſe they had intelligence with them, that they might doe a good office, and, as they ſaide, vndeceiue him, and make him to know the truth. They imployed alſo herein the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who, hauing much opportunitie to ſpeake often with him, becauſe thoſe Kings had almoſt the ſame intereſt in reſpect of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Eccleſiaſticall, did cunningly (becauſe hee was much obliged to the Pope) lay before him the things which the Popes miniſters had ſuggeſted to him, for the ſeruice of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 22. of Aprill, appointed for the Seſſion, drawing neere, a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was held the day before, to conſult about the prorogation of it. The Legates did propoſe the deferring of it vntill the third of Iune. But <hi>Loraine</hi> ſaid it was a great ſcandall to all Chriſtendome to prorogue the Seſſion ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and neuer to hold it? which would be increaſed alſo if it were put off to another day, and afterwards deferred againe? therefore, ſeeing that none of the things propoſed and handled concerning Reſidence, and the Sacraments of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Matrimony</hi> were reſolued, it was better not to prefixe a certaine day, but to expect vntill the twentieth of May, and then to reſolue vpon the time, becauſe the progreſſe of all things would then more plainely appeare; and, in the meane while, not to looſe time, voyces may bee giuen concerning the Articles of the abuſes of the Sacrament of <hi>Order,</hi> before the ende whereof Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> would be returned from the Emperour, with ample reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherby the matters in controuerſie may bee compoſed, and diligence v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to finiſh the Councell within two or three moneths. Cardinall <hi>Madruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio</hi> and ſo many of the Fathers followed that opinion, that it preuailed, and it was decreed that the day to celebrate the next Seſſion ſhould bee prefixed the twentieth of May.</p>
            <p>The Congregation being ended <hi>Antonius Chierelia,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Budua,</hi> who, in deliuering his voyce, was wont to entertaine the Father, with ſome witty conceit, and oftentimes to adde ſome merrie Prophecies, which were ſpread abroad in diuers parts, did then alſo deliuer one concerning the citie of <hi>Trent.</hi> Hee ſaid in ſubſtance; that <hi>Trent</hi> had been fauoured, and elected for the citie; in which the generall concord of Chriſtendome was to bee eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, but beeing made vnworthy of that honour, by reaſon of the inho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitalitie thereof, would ſhortly incurre a generall hatred, as the ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:17208:359"/>
of greater diſcords. The ſence was couered with diuers <hi>enigmaes,</hi> in a Poeticall Propheticall forme, yet not ſo but that it was eaſily vnderſtood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loraine</hi> hauing obtained the generall conſent, with ſo much reputation, the Papalins grew iealous; who, conſidering the honour which was done to him the day before by thoſe who met him, and now by the receiuing of his opinion, thought it not onely an indignitie to the Legats, but an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance alſo to breake the Decree, that onely the Legates ſhould propoſe. And they ſpeake Publiquely, that the Pope ſaid well, that the Cardinall was Head of a partie, and that hee prolonged the quicke diſpatch of the Councell, and hindered the iourney to <hi>Bolonia.</hi> But <hi>Loraine,</hi> not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what was ſaid in <hi>Trent,</hi> and intending his negotiation with the Emperour, diſpatched a Gentleman to him, with the opinion of the Doctours, concerning the Articles put into conſultation by his Maieſtie, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Loraine</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to the Emperour.</note> whom hee cauſed to tell him, that, for the good proceeding of the Councel, it was neceſſary hee ſhould ſpeake earneſtly to <hi>Morone,</hi> and ſhew his great deſire to ſee good reſolutions, for the glory of God; as alſo of the deſire of all the good Fathers that hee would not remooue further from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, in regard of the fruit which they hoped for, by meanes of his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinitie, which will keepe euery one in his dutie, and hinder the attempts of thoſe who would tranſlate it into another place, as hee was aduiſed that ſome did lay plots to doe, and that before he parted from <hi>Iſpruce,</hi> his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie would bee aſſured that the libertie of the Councell, whereof hee is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour, might bee preſerued. Hee ſent him a copie of the Edict of <hi>Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and of a letter of the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in which ſhe gaue account of her deliuery from a great conſpiracie, and of her reſolution to liue and die in the Catholique Religion. In the end, the Cardinall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Maieſtie to vſe ſome meanes that there might bee no diſpute in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell for the precedence, betweene <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> that the good procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof might not bee hindered.</p>
            <p>The two Legats, that they might not doe nothing in the abſence of <hi>Morone,</hi> did, the 24. of April, impart to the Ambaſſadours the Decrees com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed concerning the abuſes of <hi>Order,</hi> that they might conſider on them: and the 29. day they gaue them to the Prelats. The firſt, of the election of Biſhops, in which were expreſſed their qualities conformable to the ancient Canons, the Ambaſſadours did not approue, becauſe it ſeemed to reſtraine too much the authoritie of their Princes in the preſentation or nomination of them. And they all laboured very much, eſpecially the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> that it might bee amended, or rather quite omitted; a thing which did likewiſe much pleaſe the Legates. And the Emperours miniſters made difficulty alſo in regard of their deſſeigne to make an occaſion ariſe of handling the election of Cardinals, and by conſequence, of the Pope.</p>
            <p>The ſame day at night Cardinall <hi>Nauaggero</hi> (hauing giuen out, to auoid <note place="margin">The Legate <hi>Nauaggero</hi> commeth to <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> meetings and ceremonies, that hee would enter the next day) arriued in <hi>Trent;</hi> who ſaid, that, at their departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope had told them, that they ſhould make a good and a rigorous reformation, preſeruing the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, of the Apoſtolique <hi>Sea,</hi> which is abſolutely neceſſary, to keepe the Church in good forme and order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="700" facs="tcp:17208:360"/>
But not with ſtanding all this, his Holineſſe in his ſpeaches to the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours reſiding with him, deſired them to tell him what reformation their Princes would haue. And his end was, that, their demands beeing giuen to him, they might forbeare to preſent them to the Councel, and ſo haue means, by ſhewing the inuincible difficultie in euery particular, to pacifie the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging humour of reformation. And hee ſaid often to the Ambaſſadors, that their Princes were deceiued if they thought a reformation would reduce the <note place="margin">The Popes diſcourſe to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</note> heretiques, who firſt of all made themſelues Apoſtates, and then alleadged the abuſes and deformations, for a pretence; that the true cauſes which haue mooued the heretikes to follow their falſe teachers are not the abuſes of the Clergie, but of ciuill gouernements; that if all defects of the Eccleſiaſtiques were wholy corrected, yet they would not returne, but would inuent other colours, to perſeuere in their obſtinacie; that theſe abuſes were not in the primitiue Church, nor in the time of the Apoſtles, and yet as many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, in proportion of the faithfull, were then as now; that himſelfe did deſire, in ſincerity of conſcience, that the Church might bee amended, and the abuſes remooued, but ſaw plainely that thoſe, who doe procure it, doe not aime at this good marke, but at their particular profit, which in caſe they ſhould obtaine, greater abuſes would ariſe, and the preſent not bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, that the reformation is not hindered by him, but by the Princes, and by the Prelates in Councell; that himſelfe would make one, and that very rigorous alſo, but in caſe hee ſhould come to the concluſion, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions betweene Princes, ſome deſiring it after one manner, ſome after another, and thoſe of the Prelates, who are no leſſe oppoſite, would hinder all; that hee knoweth very well that it is vnſeemely to attempt that which would onely diſcouer the common defects and wants, and that thoſe who deſire reformation, mooued with zeale, doe, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, vſe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſtian wiſedome, and nothing would bee effected, but as now it is knowen that the Church hath defects, ſo it would appeare that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, and which is worſe, men would begin to defend and to iuſtifie them, as lawfull vſe.</p>
            <p>Hee did expect, with impatience, the end of the negotiation of <hi>Morone;</hi> from whom hee had aduice that the Emperour tooke time to anſwere, and ſtill continued in conſulting vpon the Articles. Hee thought that all the orders and reſolutions which came out of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, did proceede from the opinion and counſell of <hi>Loraine;</hi> and therefore, <note place="margin">The Popes plot to gaine the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine.</hi>
               </note> not to omitte any meanes of gaining him, the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrara</hi> beeing to returne into <hi>Italy</hi> very ſhortly, with whom <hi>Loraine</hi> was to ſpeake, for many cauſes concerning their common nephewes, hee wrote vnto him to vſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions that hee would be content with the tranſlation of the Councell to <hi>Bolonia;</hi> and, that hee might bee well informed of the affaires of <hi>Trent,</hi> hee gaue order that <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> ſhould meete <hi>Ferrara,</hi> before his parley with <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,</hi> and carie with him the inſtructions of the Legats, beſides that which himſelfe did know.</p>
            <p>The moneth of May did begin with new diſcourſes of the peace of <hi>France,</hi> For the Kings letters came to <hi>Loraine</hi> and the French Ambaſſadours, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them thereof, with commiſſion to impart all to the Fathers of the
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:17208:360"/>
Councell either in generall or in particular, as ſeemed them beſt. The let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were dated the fifteenth of the laſt moneth, and did ſhew principally, that by the peace he had no intention to fauour the introduction or eſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bliſhment of a new religion in the kingdome, but that, with leſſe contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and difficultie he might reduce all his people into one holy Catholike religion, by laying downe of armes, and remoouing, the ciuill diſſentions and calamities. But he added, that a pious and ſerious reformation (alwaie expected from a generall and free Councell) would aſſiſt him moſt of all, in this good worke; for ſolicitation of which, hee was reſolued to ſend the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident <hi>Birague</hi> to <hi>Trent.</hi> But, in the meane while, he gaue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap> to the Ambaſſadoures already in that Citie, to let the Fathers know, vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> good occaſion, that he was ſenſible ſtill of the ruines and afflictions which the diuerſity of opinions in religion haue cauſed in his kingdome, with the apparant decay, and greater danger of the State; that rather then hee would returne to that extremity, hee was reſolued, in caſe the generall Councell would not performe its duty, and that which is expected from it, by ſo holy and neceſſary a reformation, to call a Nationall hauing firſt giuen ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to GOD and men, by continuall perſwaſions vſed to the Fathers and the Pope to obtaine of them a remedy againſt the common euill; that, to effect this with greater eaſe, he had diſpatched the Lord of <hi>Oyſel</hi> to the Catholique King, and the Lord <hi>d' Allegres</hi> to the Pope, and commanded <hi>Birague,</hi> that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had performed his charge with the Fathers of the Councell, he ſhould paſſe to the Emperour, to try, if, by meanes of theſe Princes, bee might gaine ſo great a benefit.</p>
            <p>It is certaine that the Pope was much diſtaſted with the peace, as well for the preiudice of his authority, as becauſe it was concluded without his knowledge, hauing made ſo great contributions to the war. But the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> was diſpleaſed more. For beeing, by his ſouldiers, a party in the warres, and the victory, and hauing ſpent ſo much, hee thought all was loſt, and that it was not iuſt to conclude a peace without him, to the preiudice of religion, which hee vndertooke to defend and maintaine; eſpecially hauing ſo great intereſts therein; in reſpect of the damage hee did receiue in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Low Countries: it beeing plaine, that euery proſperity of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> would encourage the people of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and ſtrong then them more in their contumacie. For theſe reaſons, the Catholique Ambaſſadour in <hi>France,</hi> made great complaints; which was the principall cauſe, why theſe extraordinary Ambaſſages were ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to make knowen that the King and his Councel were not induced to make this accord by their owne will, but by meere neceſſity, and for feare that groſſe Armies would bee ſent out of <hi>Germany</hi> to the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> which, as was reported; were prepared about <hi>Strasburg,</hi> and in other places. For thoſe Dutch men, who had made warre in <hi>France,</hi> beeing returned home, loaden with ſpoiles they inuited others to goe thither and make themſelues rich.

poſſeſſed <hi>Haure de Grace.</hi> But, beſides this principall end of both the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſages, <hi>d'Oyſel</hi> was afterwards to make a propoſition for tranſlating the Councel from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Conſtance, Wormes, Ausburg,</hi> or ſome other place in <hi>Germany,</hi> and to repreſent to the King, that, in regard it ought to bee celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Dutch, Engliſh, Scottiſh, and part of the French-men, and other Nations, who were reſolute not to adhere to, nor euer to accept that of <hi>Trent,</hi> it was in vaine to continue in that place. <hi>Conde</hi> was author of this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation; who hoped by this meanes, if it did ſucceed, to ſtrengthen his party, by vniting it to the intereſts of ſo many Kingdomes and Princes, and to weaken the Oatholiques, by promoting difficulties againſt the Councell of <hi>Trent.</hi> But it did not take effect. For the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> hauing heard the propoſition (which I ſay by way of anticipation that I may not returne to this matter) did perceiue what the aime was; and made a full anſwere that the Councell was aſſembled in <hi>Trent</hi> with all the ſolemnities, with conſent of all Kings, Princes, and at the inſtance of <hi>Francis</hi> the French King; that the Emperour had ſuperiority in that City, as in the others that were named, and might giue full ſecurity to all, in caſe the former Safe conduct were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that hee could not chooſe but fauour it in the place where it was, and accept the determinations thereof. And hee aduiſed the Pope of all, aſſuring him hee would neuer change that reſolution.</p>
            <p>The French men in <hi>Trent</hi> thought it ſuperfluous to make inſtance to the Fathers, as the King had commanded, before the returne of <hi>Morone,</hi> it being generally reſolued that all Conciliary actions ſhould bee deferred vntill then. But the Emperour had not diſpatched that Cardinall, and informed <hi>Loraine</hi> at the ſame time, that, for diuers accidents, and becauſe the propoſitions were of the weight and importance, as that they did deſerue mature deliberation and conſultation, he had not beene able as yet, to giue a reſolute anſwere but hee hoped it ſhould bee ſuch, as to make all men know, that his actions were anſwerable to his deſire, to ſee the affaires of the Councell ſet ſtraight, for the common benefit. Therefore, notwithſtanding the occaſions and vrgent neceſſities of his other Prouinces, hee reſolued to continue his reſidence in <hi>Iſprue,</hi> to fauour the liberty of the Councell, by his preſence, vntill hee had hope to ſee ſome good fruit. This delay did not pleaſe <hi>Morone,</hi> not that the Emperour ſhould referre, as hee did, all the negotiations to the Diuines, and Counſellors: and both hee and the Pope did doubt that the anſwere would be deferred vntill he had heard <hi>Birague,</hi> who as they were informed, was to propoſe the tranſlation of the Councel into <hi>Germany,</hi> to giue ſatisfaction to the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> whereunto the Pope was reſolute not to conſent, as well by his owne inclination, as in regard of the inſtance made vnto him by the Colledge of Cardinals and all the Court. And he maruelled at the humor of the French-men, who demanded reformation and a tranſlation at the ſame time, and deſired to haue a ſupply from the Clergie, for payment of the Kings de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But the truth was that the French-men, being aſſured they could obtaine nothing fit for their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

euery one might propoſe: deſiring they would preſently begin to handle the Articles exhibited by him and <hi>France.</hi> Concerning this negotiation of the Cardinall, and of the anſwere made, I haue related what I haue found regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in publike monuments; but I ought not to omit the fame, then diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in <hi>Trent,</hi> and beleeued by men of the greateſt vnderſtanding, that the Cardinall had treated with the Emperour, and with his ſonne, King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> more ſecret matters, and ſhewed them, that in reſpect of the diuers <note place="margin">The ſecret ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation of the Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> with the Emperor.</note> ends of Princes and Prelats, and of their diuers and important intereſts, which were contrary, it was impoſſible the Councell ſhould haue ſuch an end as ſome of them did deſire. Hee told them, that, in the matter of the Chalice, marriage of Prieſts, and of the vulgar tongue, things deſired by his Maieſtie and the French King, neither the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> nor any Prince of <hi>Italie</hi> would euer conſent; that, in matter of reformation, euery ſort of perſons would remaine in their preſent ſtate, and reforme others; whence it commeth that euery one demandeth reformation, and yet, when any Article thereof is propoſed, more doe oppoſe then fauour it; that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one thinketh of himſelfe onely, and doth not conſider the reſpects of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that euery one would haue the Pope a miniſter of his deſignes, not thinking whether others will remaine offended for it; for whom it is neither honeſt, nor profitable, to fauour one with the diſſeruice of another; that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one would haue the glory, to procure the reformation, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuere in the abuſes, laying the burthen vpon the Pope onely. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall diſcourſed alſo, that, for the reformation of the Pope himſelfe, he would not ſay what the minde of his holineſſe was; but for that which neither doth nor can touch him, how can any one perſwade himſelfe that hee would not condeſcend, but that hee knoweth that which is vnknowne to others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the reſpects of all are referred vnto him alone. Hee ſaide moreouer, that the experience of theſe fifteene moneths ſince the opening of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, hath ſhewed, that the pretenſions are multiplied, and the diuerſitie of opinions increaſed, and doe ſtill proceede forward to the height; that, in caſe it ſhould continue long, ſome notable ſcandall muſt neceſſarily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Hee told him of the iealouſie which did poſſeſſe the Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> and the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and concluded that ſeeing it was plaine that the Councell could doe no good, it was expedient to finiſh it in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it was poſſible. It was ſayd that thoſe Princes were perſwaded that they could neuer obtaine any thing that was good by meanes of the Councell, and therefore thought it better to bury it with honour, and that they gaue their word to that Cardinall to vſe conniuencie heereafter, and not to take it ill if the Councell were ended. And hee that ſhall obſerue what ende the <note place="margin">Who giueth his word to conniue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</note> Councell had, and that thoſe Princes had no ſatisfaction in any of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, will eaſily beleeue that the fame was true; but conſidering, on the other ſide, that the inſtances of the Emperours miniſters did not ceaſe after this negotiation, hee will thinke it a vaine rumour. But to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde both the abſurdities, one may beleeue that thoſe Princes did then lay hope aſide, and reſolue not to oppoſe the ending of the Councell; yet ſo, as that they helde it not honourable to make a ſudden retreate,
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:17208:363"/>
but to remit their inſtances by degrees, that they might not publiſh their want of iudgement, for conceiuing hope of good by that meanes, and for not beleeuing the obſeruation of Saint <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> who teſtifieth, that contentions haue alwayes been increaſed by the Epiſcopall aſſemblies. The trueth of this particular I put in the number of thoſe things, the knowledge whereof I cannot attaine vnto. But it is certaine that the <hi>cataſtrophe</hi> of the Councell, which it was thought could not poſſiblie haue a quiet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, had beginning in this time.</p>

And, becauſe they knew not when the matters would bee in order, in the Congregation of the nineteenth day, a prorogation was made vntill the tenth of Iune, to determine then the prefixed time. In that Congregation two notable things did happen. One was the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whether it did belong to the Legates, or to the Councell, to determine <note place="margin">A queſtion about the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Legats.</note> whether the Proctors of the Biſhops ought to be admitted in Congregation, begunne (as we haue ſaid) by <hi>Lanſac.</hi> The French Prelates did maintaine, that the Legates had no other prerogatiue but to be the firſt, and had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as they were ſeparated from the Fathers of the Councell; alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Councell of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and other monuments of antiquity. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, it was ſaid, that the Councell could not bee lawfull, except it were called by the Pope, and that it belongeth to him onely to determine who may aſſiſt and haue voyce in it; and that to giue this power to the Councell, would be to giue it authority to generate it ſelfe. After ſome contention, the matter did remaine vndecided. In giuing of voyces concerning the abuſes of <hi>Order</hi> another queſtion ſucceeded. For the Biſhop of <hi>Philodelphia</hi> made a great and a long exclamation, that Cardinals haue Biſhopriques without maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo much as a Suffragan; which was much derided by many, as if the Biſhop, being but titular, had ſpoken for the intereſt of himſelfe, and of ſuch as he was.</p>
            <p>In the Congregation of the 21. of May the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> was receiued, <note place="margin">The Count of <hi>Luna</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> forty dayes after his arriuall, in regard of the difficulties for precedence with
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:17208:364"/>
the French Ambaſſadours. In the meane while, many conſultations were held to compoſe them; but the French would by no meanes yeeld that hee ſhould haue any place but below, and after them. Whereupon he thought to ſtand on his feet in the midſt of the place amongſt the Emperors Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours (who had order from their Maſter to accompany him,) and to ſtand by them vntill hee had finiſhed his oration, and then to returne preſently to his houſe. But this ſeemed diſhonourable for the King. Therefore hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to perſwade the French not to enter in Congregation that day; whereunto they not conſenting, He thought to force them to it, by making ſome Spaniſh Prelat demaund, that Secular Ambaſſadours might not aſſiſt in the Congregations, becauſe they were neuer admitted in the ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. But thinking that this would offend all Princes, hee purpoſed to vſe meanes that ſome Prelats ſhould propoſe the handling of ſome things, at which it would not be reaſonable that the French Ambaſſadours ſhould bee preſent; as might be, the preiudices which might come to Chriſtendome by the capitulations made with the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> or ſome ſuch thing. This, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the eares of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> put another courſe in his head; and, conſulting with the other French men, they reſolued not to conteſt any more, if a place were giuen him a part out of the order of the Ambaſſadours. Therefore the Count, entring into the Congregation the day before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and comming to the place aſsigned for him, which was in the midſt of <note place="margin">His proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about place.</note> the aſſembly ouer againſt the Legates, he preſented the <hi>Mandat</hi> of his King; which being read by the Secretarie, hee immediatly proteſted, that, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, in that and all other places, he ought to be next after the Emperors Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, yet becauſe that place, the cauſe which was handled, and the time did not comport that the courſe of diuine matters, and of the publique welfare ſhould be hindred by humane contentions, he did receiue the place giuen him, but proteſting that his modeſty, and the reſpect hee had not to hinder the progreſſe of the Councell ought not to be preiudiciall to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and right of his Prince, <hi>Philip,</hi> the Catholike King, nor of his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but that they remaine intire, ſo that they may alwayes make vſe of them, as if his due place had now beene giuen vnto him; requiring that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation might be written in the Actes, and that they may not be publiſhed without it, and a copy thereof giuen vnto him. After this the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors did proteſt alſo, that if they ſhould ſet in any other place then next to the Ambaſſadors of the Emperour, and before the Ambaſſadors of other Kings, which their Predeceſſors haue alwayes held, and namely in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and the <hi>Lateran,</hi> they ſhould bee wronged; and if the new place in which the Ambaſſador of his Catholike Maieſtie did ſet, ſhould bring any preiudice to them, or to the <hi>Orators,</hi> the Fathers of the Councell, repreſenting the Church vniuerſall, ſhould reduce them to the ancient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or giue them the Euangelicall admonition. But the Fathers holding their peace, and the Emperors Ambaſſadours ſaying nothing, whoſe intereſt is common with thoſe of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe they ſit next vnto them, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the ancient poſſeſsion of their King, the French Ambaſſadours in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the amity and alliance betweene the Catholike and moſt Chriſtian Kings, demanded nothing but that the Fathers of the Councell would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:17208:364"/>
that the Count his fact could not preiudice the ancient prerogatiue and perpetuall poſſeſſion of his moſt Chriſtian Maieſtie, and regiſter this in the Actes.</p>
            <p>The Oration was made, in the name of the Count, by <hi>Petrus Fontidonius,</hi> a Diuine; who ſaid in ſubſtance. That, the end of the Councell drawing neere, his Catholike Maieſtie had ſent that Ambaſſadour, to ſhew himſelfe readie to doe for it that which <hi>Martianus</hi> the Emperour did in the Councell <note place="margin">The Oration made in his name.</note> of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that is, to maintaine and defend the trueth, declared by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node, to pacifie the tumults, and to conduct to an happie ende that Councel which his Father, <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, Emperour hath protected in its birth and growth, for the cauſe whereof hee hath made moſt difficult and dangerous warres, and which his Vncle, the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> doeth maintaine, that his King hath omitted no office of a Catholike Prince, that it might be called and celebrated; that he hath ſent the Prelats of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and moſt learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors beſides; that hee hath preſerued religion in <hi>Spaine;</hi> that he hath hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the entrance of hereſie at all the paſſages of the <hi>Pirenies,</hi> nor ſuffered it to paſſe to the <hi>Indies,</hi> whither it hath laboured to penetrate, to infect the rootes of Chriſtianitie, ſpringing in that new world; that, by meanes of that King, faith and puritie of doctrine doeth flouriſh in that kingdome, ſo that the holy mother the Church, when ſhee ſeeth other Prouinces infected with errours, taketh great conſolation, that <hi>Spaine</hi> is the holy anchor for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge of all her calamities. Hee added, would to GOD that other Catholike Princes and Chriſtian common-wealthes would imitate the ſeueritie of that King, in bridling the Heretikes, that the Church might bee deliuered from ſo many miſeries, and the Fathers of <hi>Trent</hi> from the care of celebrating the Councell; that his King maried with <hi>Mary,</hi> Queene of <hi>England,</hi> for no other ende then to reduce that Iſland to the true religion. Hee repeated the late aſſiſtance ſent to the King of <hi>France,</hi> adding, that, by the vertue of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, though but few, ſent for defence of religion, the victorie inclined to the Catholike partie. Hee ſaide the King deſired the eſtabliſhment of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of religion and the reformation of manners. Hee commended the Fathers, becauſe in the handling of theſe two, they would not ſeparate the one from the other, howſoeuer great inſtance was made vnto them to cauſe them to omit the doctrine, and proceed in the reformation only. He ſaid the Kings deſire was they ſhould examine well the petition, more pious then circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, of thoſe, who ſay that ſome thing ought to bee graunted to the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, that, being ouercome with kindneſſe, they may returne to the boſome of the Church; ſaying, that they haue to doe with perſons, who cannot bee bowed neither with benefits nor with pittie. Hee exhorted the Fathers, in the Kings name, to proceede in ſuch ſort, as to ſhew they haue a greater care of the Maieſtie of the Church, then of the deſires of thoſe that wander, and that the Church hath alwayes vſed this grauitie and conſtancie in repreſſing the boldneſſe of her enemies, not to grant them ſo much as that which it honeſtly might. He ſaid, the King deſired that ſuperfluous queſtions might be omitted; and concluded, that the Fathers being aſſembled to doe ſo good a worke, as to cure the diſeaſes which afflict Chriſtendome, if this were not effected, poſteritie would blame none but them, and wonder, that, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:17208:365"/>
they would not alſo bee willing to apply the remedie. Hee praiſed the vertues of the Ambaſſadour, and the glorie of his houſe; and ſo ended. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere was made, in the name of the Synode, that, in their griefe for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon miſeries, they receiued conſolation, hearing the pietie of the Catholike K. related, and, aboue all, that his promiſe to defend the Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was moſt acceptable; which the Emperor, and other Chriſtian Kings and Princes being willing to doe alſo, the Synod was ſtirred vp to take care that <note place="margin">The anſwere.</note> her actions may be anſwerable to their deſires, as it hath done already, both by their own inclination and by the exhortation of the Pope, alwaies imploying themſelues in the emendation of maners, and in the explication of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like doctrine; that it gaue the King many thanks, as for his ſingular affection towards religion, and good will towards the Synod, ſo for ſending ſuch an <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato,</hi> from whom they did hope for honour and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The Oration diſpleaſed all the Ambaſſadours, becauſe it was a manifeſt reprehenſion of all Princes, for not imitating the Catholike King; and they complained thereof to the Count, who anſwered, that thoſe wordes did as much diſpleaſe him, yea that he gaue order to the Doctor to leaue them out, and not to ſpeake them by any meanes, and that he would be ſenſible of his diſobedience. The French-men in <hi>Rome</hi> blamed much thoſe in <hi>Trent,</hi> for <note place="margin">The French-men in <hi>Rome</hi> complaine of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine.</hi>
               </note> conſenting to the place giuen to the Spaniſh Ambaſſador. They ſaide that <hi>Loraine,</hi> for his owne intereſts, and to gratifie the Catholike King had done this great preiudice to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> as alſo becauſe hee had counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Pope not to grant the King the alienation of 100000. crownes of Eccleſiaſticall goods, as he demanded. They added that in all things he ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med only at his owne intereſts, and therefore becauſe neither he, nor his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did manage the money, he did not care though the King ſhould receiue none at all. But the difference for precedence was not as yet well ended. For howſoeuer there was a place found for the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour in the congregations, the ſame could not bee giuen him in the Seſſions. Where-vpon the Legates wrote to the Pope, to haue order how to gouerne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>After the Spaniſh Ambaſſador was receiued, <hi>Loraine</hi> parted to meet with the Card. of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> who, being arriued in <hi>Piemont,</hi> found the affaires of that <note place="margin">The ſtate of religion in <hi>Piemont.</hi>
               </note> Countrey in no better ſtate then thoſe in <hi>France.</hi> For in diuers places of the <hi>Marquiſate</hi> of <hi>Saluzzo</hi> all the Prieſts were hunted away; and in <hi>Cherie,</hi> and <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> places belonging to the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> and in many other Cities neere vnto them, many were of the ſame opinions with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> and many euen in the Dukes Court alſo did profeſſe them, and more were diſcouered euery day. And howſoeuer the Duke had ſet forth a Proclamation, a moneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that all that followed thoſe opinions ſhould within eight dayes part out of the Countrey, and ſome alſo were departed, yet afterwards he commanded that there ſhould bee no proceeding againſt them, yea pardoned many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and made their proceſſes void, as alſo of thoſe who were in the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and not condemned, and gaue leaue to ſome that were departed, to returne. But the Cardinall, vnderſtanding the reaſons of the Duke, was forced to beleeue that which hee was vſed to ſay of the affaires of <hi>France,</hi> that to doe ſo, would turne to the ſeruice of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="711" facs="tcp:17208:365"/>
This Cardinall receiued inſtitution in the ſame place, from the Biſhop of <hi>Vintimiglia,</hi> who went expreſly to informe him (as hath beene ſaid before) of the affaires of the Councell, and how to treate with <hi>Loraine.</hi> Both the Cardinals met in <hi>Aſti</hi> the foure and twentieth of May. <hi>Ferrara</hi> hauing rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the eſtate of <hi>France,</hi> and of their familie, ſince the death of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and of the <hi>Prior,</hi> exhorted him to a Sudden returne, ſhowing what neceſſitie the family had of his preſence. Hee told him, that, ſince the peace <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aine</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> meet in <hi>Oſtia.</hi>
               </note> was made with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> there formation would not produce thoſe good effects in <hi>France</hi> as was beleeued. But he found (which hee could not haue beleeued before) that hee had a great impreſſion, that his honour did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that he ſhould abandon the negotiation. <hi>Loraine</hi> complained that <hi>Morone,</hi> turned from the Emperour, had acquainted him with no part of his buſineſſe, ſaying that hee had beene aduiſed of all by his Maieſtie. Hee ſaid that the Catholique King was well vnited with the Emperour, and that there was good intelligence betweene the Count of <hi>Luna,,</hi> and him. In the matter of reſidence, hee ſaid it was neceſſary it ſhould bee declared, and that this was the opinion of the Emperour, and of almoſt all the prelates, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome few Italians, and that the declaration was demanded, that the Pope might not diſpeuce; ſo that the labour of the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrara</hi> did little good. And the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> returning to <hi>Trent;</hi> did diuulge, that the Cardinall of <hi>Ferrara</hi> had perſwaded him, in the name of the Pope and Legates, that the reſidence might bee determined with a penall. Decree, without declaring that it is <hi>de iure diuino;</hi> whereunto hee ſaid hee would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aſſent.</p>
            <p>But Cardinall <hi>Morone;</hi> to pacifie <hi>Loraine</hi> before hee entred ſeriouſly into the affaires of the Councell, knowing it was neceſſary to make ſhew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring <note place="margin">And their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

There fell out an accident which was ſufficient to confound and diuide the Popiſh Prelates amongſt themſelues.

            <p>After this time <hi>Loraine</hi> began to remit his rigor. For <hi>France,</hi> beeing now, by obſeruation of things paſt, aſſured, that nothing fit for the ſeruice <note place="margin">

Therefore the Queene <note place="margin">The Queene mother wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the Pope and the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine.</hi>
               </note> wrote to <hi>Rome,</hi> and offered the Pope to ioyne with him to finiſh the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell quickly, to curbe <hi>Loraine,</hi> and the French Prelates, that they may not impugne his authoritie, and to cauſe all the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Souldiers to depart from <hi>Auignion,</hi> and the territorie thereof. Shee wrote likewiſe to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> that the affaires of <hi>France</hi> did proceede exceedingly well, and that to giue them perfection, nothing wanted but his preſence, where beeing able to doe more good then in <hi>Trent,</hi> in which place he had found by experience that no profitable thing can bee done hee ſhould vſe meanes to quitte himſelfe of thoſe affaires, and returne aſſoone as was poſſible, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to giue the Pope all ſatisfaction, and to make him his friend and, for matters of the councell, not to thinke on them, more then his conſcience and honour did compell him. Shee added, that hee ſhould haue the ſame authoritie in the kingdome as hee had before; and therefore ſhould haſten his returne.</p>
            <p>The Queenes letters came to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> in the end of May; which, as they were very gratefull to the Pope; and made him beleeue he ſhould ſee a good end of the Councel, ſo an other accident did much diſpleaſe him. For, in <hi>France,</hi> conſultation beeing had how to pay the debts of the Crowne, the <note place="margin">Eccleſiaſticall goods are ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in <hi>France</hi> without the Popes leaue.</note> Decree, for aliening the valew of one hundred thouſand crownes of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall immooueable goods, was confirmed by the Kings Edict; and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Parlament. This raiſed a great tumult of the Prieſts, who ſaid,
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:17208:366"/>
their priuiledges and immunities were violated, and that ſacred things could not bee aliened for any cauſe whatſoeuer, without the authority and decree of the Pope. To pacifie which noiſe, the Ambaſſadour deſired his Holineſſe to giue his conſent, alleadging, that the King was exhauſted by the laſt warres, deſeigning to put his affaires in order, that hee may beginne, as his purpoſe euer was ſince the making of the peace, to reunite all the Kingdome in the Catholique religion; and, that hee might be able to force whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhould oppoſe, he meant to impoſe a ſubſidie, and to cauſe the Clergie to contribute their part alſo; whereunto the Church was ſo much more bound then others, by how much her intereſts were more in queſtion; that, all beeing conſidered, nothing was found to bee more eaſie then to ſupply that neceſſity with the alienation of ſome few Eccleſiaſticall reuenues; wherein he deſired the conſent of his Holineſſe.</p>
            <p>The Pope anſwered, that the demand was painted foorth with a faire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <note place="margin">Which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Pope angry.</note> of defending the Church, but was the onely way to ruine it, for the auoiding whereof, his ſecureſt courſe was not to conſent to it. And howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſome might thinke that the French would proceed to execution with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him; yet he was of opinion that leaue would not haue beene demanded, in caſe they could haue found buyers without it, thinking that none would dare to aduenture their money, fearing (as the affaires of the world are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine) a time might come in which the Eccleſiaſtiques would reſume their rents, and not reſtore the price. Therefore, hauing propoſed the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe in Conſiſtory, by the deliberation of the Cardinals, he reſolued not to conſent, but, by diuers excuſes, to ſhew it was impoſſible to obtaine that demand at his hands. <hi>Loraine,</hi> bearing an irreconciliable hate to the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi> not ſo much for religion, as for faction, which himſelfe and his houſe had alwaies with them, beeing aſſured it was impoſſible to reconcile friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, was much diſpleaſed that the matters of the peace did proceed. For his returne into <hi>France,</hi> hee thought fit to conſider very well when and in what manner it ought to bee; and, for his particular affaires, hee thought it neceſſary to hold good intelligence with the Pope, and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and with the Miniſters of <hi>Spaine</hi> alſo, more then formerly he had done. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he beganne from that day not to be ſo ſeuere in procuring the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to ſhew greater reuerence to the Pope, and to haue good correſpon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dence with the Legats.</p>
            <p>But beſides the trouble for the demand of the alienation, the Pope had another, of no loſſe weight. For, hauing often promiſed the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour <note place="margin">Agreat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in <hi>Rome</hi> about prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the French and Spaniſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours</note> to giue him his due place at Whitſontide, and deſiring to performe it, he aſſembled ſome Cardinals to find a meanes to giue the Spaniſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour ſatisfaction. The courſes were propoſed, one to giue him place vnder the Deacon on the left hand; another, vpon a ſtoole at the top of the Deacons bench. But theſe did not take away the difficulty. For there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill matter of our currencie in bearing the traine of his Holineſſe and giuing water for his hands, when hee did celebrate the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> and in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing incenſe and the pax.

               </gap> because the Pope was not to celebrate, and the Emperours Ambaſſadour was to bee there. For the <hi>incenſe</hi> and the pax, a temper was

found, that they ſhould be giuen to all on the right ſide, euen to the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of <hi>Florence</hi> alſo, who was the laſt, and then to thoſe on the left. The French was not content with this, and ſaid, that the Pope had promiſed him his place, and that the Spaniard either ſhould not come, or ſhould ſtand vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; and would depart from <hi>Rome,</hi> if this were not performed. And it pleaſed the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour as little: whereupon the Pope ſent him word that he was reſolute to giue the French Ambaſſadour his place. The Spaniard anſwered, that, if the Pope were reſolute to doe him that grieuance, hee would read a writing to him. The Cardinals, who treated with him in the Popes name, ſhewed him it was not good to doe ſo, before his Holineſſe had ſeene it, leſt, not being knowen before ſome inconuenience might ariſe. The Ambaſſadour was vnwilling to giue it, but, in the end, was content. Which the Pope hauing read, was very angry at the forme of words, which <note place="margin">The Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spaniſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador.</note> he ſaid were impertinent. Finally, he was brought into the Popes Chamber with foure witneſſes, where he read his proteſtation, on his knees; which did containe. That the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> ought to precede the French King, in regard of the antiquity, power and greatneſſe of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his other Kingdomes, by which he is the greateſt and moſt potent King of the world; becauſe the Catholike faith, and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> haue euer beene defended, and preſerued in his ſtates; that, if his Holineſſe will declare, or hath declared, in words or writing, in fauour of <hi>France,</hi> the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance and iniuſtice was notorious. Therefore he, in the name of his King, doeth contradict all declaration of precedence, or equality, in fauour of <hi>France,</hi> as fruſtrate and void, againſt the notorious right of his Catholique Maieſtie: and, if it hath beene made, there is a nullity in it, being done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge of the cauſe, and citation of the party, and that his Holineſſe doing this, will becauſe of great inconueniences in all Chriſtendome. The Pope anſwered admitting the Proteſtation, <hi>Si,</hi> and in <hi>quantum,</hi> excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the citation omitted, becauſe hee gaue nothing to the French men, but preſerued the place in which he had euer ſeen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That the intention of the King and Councell was not to ſuffer an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction, or an eſtabliſhment of a new religion, but, on the contrary, armes and diſobedience being remoued, to reduce, with leſſe contradiction, and by the wayes obſerued by his anceſtors, to the obedience of the Church thoſe that were out of their way, and to reunite all in an holy Catholique profeſſion, knowing very well that the exerciſe of two religions cannot long ſubſiſt and continue in one kingdome.

He ſaid, that to the dignitie of a Biſhop is annexed the hauing of a place and a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and the Biſhop and Church are relatiues, as man and wife, of which one cannot be without the other; and therefore it did imply a contradiction, to ſay, that titular Biſhops were lawfull. He ſaid their ordination was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of the Court, and vſed theſe words, <hi>Figmenta humana;</hi> that there is no mention of them in antiquitie; that if any Biſhop were depriued, or did renounce, he was not held to be a Biſhop, as he is not an husband who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a wife, that the old Canoniſts do write, that there is a nullity in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations made by him who hath renounced his Biſhoprick; that the Simonies and indecences which do ariſe by meanes of theſe Biſhops, and the other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of diſcipline, are nothing in compariſon of this abuſe of giuing the name of Biſhops to thoſe who are not, and to alter the inſtitution of CHRIST, and the Apoſtles.</p>

The Biſhop of <hi>Lugo</hi> diſcourſed of Diſpenſations, ſaying, that there were many matters, concerning which if the Synod would make decrees, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to be indiſpenſable, it would bee a great ſeruice to God, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Church. Which hee did not ſay, becauſe the Synod might giue a Law to his Holineſſe, but becauſe they are things in which diſpenſations of Popes cannot be admitted; and if in a rare caſe, in a whole age, a reaſonable cauſe to diſpenſe, might happen once, yet the diſpenſation would not be iuſt <note place="margin">Of Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> in that caſe neither. For it is conuenient that a priuate perſon ſhould ſupport ſome grieuance, when there is a great publike benefit, as alſo, where many caſes deſeruing diſpenſations may occurre, to take away occaſions of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſurreptions, ſupplications, and graces, it is better to bee auaritious then liberall.</p>
            <p>One of the difficulties of the Councell; which was about Biſhop <hi>Tilefius,</hi> the Secretary, in regard of whom frequent inſtance was made, that the Actes of the Councell might be written by two, did ceaſe of itſelfe.

enlarged himſelfe with many words to conuince that Cardinall, reſuming and refuting whatſoeuer hee had ſaid in fauour of the ſuperioritie of the Councell. Hee added, that ſome held opinion of the ſuperioritie of the Councell to be as true as <hi>

               </note> in this matter, if the forme propoſed by the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> had not giuen occaſion. The Cardinall anſwered, that, at his comming to <hi>Trent,</hi> he found the difficulties already mooued; that he had compoſed that forme, being requeſted, with intention to make peace and concord, and to remedy the differences; that this not ſucceeding, hee would bee glad that the Arch-biſhop might obtaine that honour which himſelfe could not doe; thanking him beſides, that, as his maſter, he had put him in minde of that wherein hee had failed. And, for the queſtion of the ſuperioritie of the Councell, hee ſaid, that being borne in <hi>France,</hi> where this opinion is common, neither hee nor the other Frenchmen could leaue it, and did not beleeue, that, for hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, they ſhould bee forced to make a Canonicall abiuration. The Arch-biſhop replyed, that he diſliked the forme, becauſe it was imperfect, whence the difficulties did ariſe; but, for the reſt, it was not a place to anſwere him, and that he did little eſteeme the iniuries he did him. But he complained of ſome who did profeſſe to accuſe the actions of the Legats, wherein they did not ſhew a good minde. The Cardinall was ſilent, and made no ſhew hee was offended. The Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> whether of his owne accord, or at the inſtance of the Frenchmen, reprehended the Archbiſhop, ſaying, that if it came to the eares of his Catholique Maieſty, it would certainly diſpleaſe him. And a French Prelate, either by order from <hi>Loraine,</hi> or of himſelfe, did aduertiſe <hi>Morone,</hi> that the Archbiſhop did much paſſe his bounds; that hee vſed bad ſpeeches, in handling the matter of Reſidence; and that the Cardinall was aduiſed, that hee was continually abuſed in his houſe, and that the moſt honourable title he gaue him, was, <hi>a man full of poiſon;</hi> ſo that, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of theſe things, and of this laſt accident alſo, it would not bee good to call them both together to conſultation, becauſe the Cardinall would not reſt ſatisfied. <hi>Morone</hi> anſwered preciſely, that hee had order from <hi>Rome</hi> to call that Archbiſhop to all conſultations, and that it was conuenient to hold eſteeme of him, becauſe hee had at the leaſt fourtie voices which did <note place="margin">The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranto</hi> had 40 voices at his command.</note> follow him. This, being related to <hi>Loraine,</hi> did make him exceeding angry againſt Cardinall <hi>Morone;</hi> and the rather, becauſe a few dayes before the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats and Cardinals conſulting together about the anſwer to bee giuen to <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rague,</hi> referred to them by the Congregation, <hi>Morone</hi> did vpbraid him, that hee was content with the anſwere firſt made, afterwards ſaid the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the generall Congregation.

his profit ouercame his paſſion, and ſo hee reſolued to continue in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the concluſion of the Councell, and giuing the Pope ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>But the Preſident <hi>Birague,</hi> hauing expected an anſwere as long as hee thought his honour would permit, the thirteenth day parted from <hi>Trent,</hi> to goe to <hi>Iſpruc,</hi> to negotiate the other part of his inſtructions with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; which was to giue him ioy of the election of the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and an account for what cauſes the Peace was concluded with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi>

            <p>The Count of <hi>Luna</hi> had expreſſe order in his inſtructions, to demaund a <note place="margin">The Spaniſh Ambaſſadour maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that the Decree, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponentibus Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatis,</hi> may be abrogated.</note> retraction of the Decree, <hi>Proponentibus Legatis;</hi> and after his arriuall in <hi>Trent,</hi> he receiued a letter from the King, which told him, that hee was deſired by the French Queene, that the Councell might be tranſlated into <hi>Germany,</hi> that it might be in a free place, and that hee had anſwered, that hee did not thinke it neceſſary, in regard there was meanes to procure the liberty of it in the place where it was; therefore hee gaue him commiſſion to labour, that it might haue full liberty, beginning from the reuocation of that Decree; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that continuing, the Councell could by no meanes be called free. The Ambaſſadour, thinking hee could not deferre any longer, imparted this commiſſion to the Legates, and, in conformity thereof, made effectuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Kings name, that the Decree might bee abrogated, or expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſaying, it was conuenient ſo to doe, becauſe the <hi>Germanes</hi> did forbeare to come to the Councel for this cauſe amongſt others, and becauſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did thinke it neceſſary, that hee might bee able to induce them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the Councel.

The Ambaſſadour gaue it, and the Legates ſent it to the Pope: howſoeuer <hi>Morone</hi> ſaid, it was ſuperfluous, and that nothing was to be done but to delay the anſwere, without troubling his Holineſſe.

They all ſpake, ſome cenſuring one, ſome another of the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> aſſertion. But the Cardinall told them, that it would be no ſmall matter if they could obtaine that, in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Decrees of the Councell, way might not bee giuen to that doctrine; at

which it was conuenient that all ſhould ayme; to which end they ſhould more eaſily come, if the matter were paſſed ouer in ſilence, and ſuffered to dye in obliuion, which, by contradiction, might doe ſome preiudice to the trueth.

            <p>But the Legates did ſo accommodate the two Articles of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Biſhops, and of Reſidence, with generall tearmes, that they <note place="margin">The Decrees of the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of Reſidence.</note> gaue ſatisfaction to both parties, and to <hi>Loraine</hi> alſo. But hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted on them with the Popiſh Diuines, and ſome Canoniſts, Prelates, theſe ſayd, that they did admitte an interpretation, preiudiciall to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Apoſtolique <hi>Sea,</hi> and the vſes of the Court. The Biſhop of <hi>Nicaſtro,</hi> who had often contended in this matter in fauour of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſayd plainely, that, by that forme of ſpeach, it was inferred that all iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Biſhops did not proceede from the Pope, but a part of it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from CHRIST; which was by no meanes to bee endured. Other Papalins maintained the ſame, and made a bad interpretation of all, if it were not plainely ſayd, that Biſhops haue all iuriſdiction from the Pope. Therefore the Legates ſent the Articles thus reformed to the Pope, not ſo much that they might bee examined in <hi>Rome,</hi> as becauſe, in a matter of ſo great importance, they would propoſe nothing without the Popes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. The Cardinals deputed for theſe affaires, hauing ſeene and examined them, did iudge that the forme was ſufficient to make all Biſhops in their Dioceſſes equall to the Popes. And the Pope reprehended the Legates for ſending them, becauſe hee knew that the <hi>maior</hi> part in the Councell were good Catholikes, and deuoted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in confidence hereof, was content that the propoſitions and reſolutions ſhould bee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in <hi>Trent</hi> without his knowledge. Notwithſtanding hee thought he ought not to conſent to any preiudiciall thing, for feare of giuing bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to them, and beeing a cauſe that they alſo ſhould aſſent vnto it againſt their conſcience.</p>
            <p>At this time they had another very hard negotiation alſo. For the King <note place="margin">A difficultie whether the King of the Romanes ought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Pope.</note> of the Romanes being to ſend Ambaſſadours, to giue him an account of his election, would not doe as other Emperours and Kings had done, who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no cauſe to make difficultie, did promiſe and ſweare whatſoeuer the Popes would haue them. But hee hauing reſpect not to offend the Princes and Proteſtants of <hi>Germanie,</hi> would firſt know what words muſt bee vſed. The conſultation hereof being committed in the Cardinals, they reſolued, that hee muſt demaund confirmation of the election, and ſweare obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, according to the example of all other Emperours. Whereunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that they were deceiued, and that hee would conſent to nothing which might preiudice his ſucceſſors, as the actions of his predeceſſors were alleadged againſt himſelfe, and that it was to confeſſe he was <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſſall.</hi> And he propoſed that his Ambaſſadour ſhould vſe theſe wordes, that his Maieſtie will performe all reuerence, deuotion and duty to his Holineſſe and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique <hi>Sea,</hi> with promiſe not onely to preſerue, but to enlarge as much as hee can the holy Catholique faith. This negotiation continued this whole yeere without agreement; and, finally, in <hi>Rome</hi> they thought they had
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:17208:372"/>
found a temper for it, propoſing that hee ſhould ſweare obedience not as Emperour, but as King of <hi>Hungarie</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> becauſe it could not bee denyed, they ſayd, that King <hi>Steuen</hi> did giue the kingdome to the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique <hi>Sea,</hi> in the yeere of our LORD 1000, acknowledging to receiue it from the ſayd <hi>Sea,</hi> and making himſelfe vaſſall; and that <hi>

                  </gap>ſlaus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi> did receiue from <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſecond power to weare a miter, binding himſelfe to pay an hundred markes of ſiluer euery yeere. Theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered of in <hi>Germanie,</hi> becauſe there was no proofe of them but the bare affirmation of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth, were derided, and anſwere was made, that they deſired more freſh examples, and more certaine, and more lawfull titles. Meſſengers went to and fro, with diuers propoſitions, anſweres, and replyes, of which we will now relate the iſſue, that wee may returne no more to them: Which was; that, twenty moneths after Count <hi>Elfeſtain,</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of that King, arriued in <hi>Rome,</hi> with whom the ſame treaties were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, to demaund confirmation, and ſweare obedience. Hee anſwered that the Oration, which he was to recite punctually, was in writing and that hee had commiſſion not to alter one iote. The Pope therefore propoſed the buſineſſe to the Cardinals, in a generall Congregation; who after long conſultation, concluded, that, howſoeuer the confirmation were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, nor obedience promiſed, yet, in the anſwere to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, it ſhould bee ſayd, that his Holineſſe did confirme the election, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying all defects thereof <hi>de facto &amp; de iure,</hi> and did receiue the Kings obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, without ſaying it was demanded, or not demanded, promiſed or not promiſed. This ceremony gaue but ſmall content to the Pope, and leſſe to the Colledge of Cardinals.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the time whereof I write, the Pope was to anſwere the frequent inſtances, made vnto him by the Ambaſſadours, reſident in <hi>Rome,</hi> and by the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> in <hi>Trent,</hi> for abrogation of the Decree of <hi>Propouentibus Legatis.</hi> And, beeing ſatiated with this trouble, hee wrote to the Legates, that the ſuſpenſion of it ſhould bee propoſed in Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. But <hi>Morone</hi> anſwered the Ambaſſadours, who vrged the Popes order, that rather then hee would condeſcend vnto it, hee deſired that his Holineſſe would remooue him. This anſwere being giuen without parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the other Legates, and many other things reſolued by him alone, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Morone</hi> is thought to take too much vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>In the Congregation of the one and twentieth of Iune, the anſwere to bee made to the Preſident <hi>Birague,</hi> compoſed by the Legates and Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> was read; which paſſed without difficultie. And becauſe he was not preſent, that it might not bee giuen him by word of mouth, they ſent it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him in writing. And <hi>Adamus Fumanis</hi> was deputed Secretary, ioyned with <hi>Tileſius,</hi> who continued in his indiſpoſition. But the differences about the Articles of the inſtitution of Biſhops, and of the authoritie of the Pope remayning ſtill, or rather increaſing, and it beeing plaine, that to ſpeake of them in Congregation, would augment them more, the Prelates, as it were,
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:17208:372"/>
with a common conſent, began to handle them particularly, and to propoſe courſes to finde a temper for them. Some, deſirous to burie theſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, and to proceede, ſeeing no meanes of concord, gaue counſell to omit both the matters abſolutely: which opinion, howſoeuer in concluſion it was receiued, in the beginning had much contradiction. The Spaniards did oppoſe; who, by all meanes would haue the Epiſcopall iuriſdiction to proceede from CHRIST; and the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> went further, and, would haue it defined, that their vocation and place were immediatly from God. And the French-men did deſire, that the Popes authority might be ſo declared as that it might neither contradict, nor diſpenſe with the Decrees of the Generall Councel. Others ſayd that this courſe ſerued onely to defer, without aſſurance that the delay would doe any good. For when they came to the concluſion of the Councel, it would bee neceſſary to define all matters which haue beene examined; ſo that the difficulty would returne; and, in caſe the French-men ſhould depart firſt, as they reſolued to doe, there would bee danger of ſchiſme, if afterwards any controuerſed point ſhould bee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Beſides, in regard of the intelligence of <hi>Loraine</hi> with the Emperour, thoſe who knew not their new thoughts, did beleeue, that the French-men being gone, his Maieſtie would recall his Ambaſſadours alſo: in which caſe it would bee ſmall reputation to continue the Councell, and, to determine any thing, would bee thought to bee a thing done without authority.</p>
            <p>Another difficultie as great as this was in the election of Biſhops. For many of the Fathers would haue it ſayd, that there is an obligation to elect the moſt worthy, and, for confirmation, alleadged many Canons, and holy Doctors. The Papalins ſaid, on the contrary, that this was to binde the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope, that hee could not gratifie any, and that the vſe of the Court time out of minde, hath beene, to thinke it ſufficient if a man worthy were elected. The French and Spaniſh Ambaſſadours alſo did not agree, becauſe it did too much reſtraine the power of Kings in nominations, if they were bound to goe about and ſeeke the moſt worthy. Many Prelates went vp and downe, vſing perſwaſions, that the Article might not bee receiued, though it were without the addition of electing the moſt worthy, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Biſhop of <hi>Bertinoro,</hi> and the Generall <hi>Laynez,</hi> diſtributing ſome annotations, and aduertiſements, made by them, ſhewing that great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences would enſue by that Decree. For in it was contayned, that a Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall being vacant, the Metropolitane ſhould write vnto the Chapter, the name of him who was to be promoted; who ſhould afterwards be publiſhed in pulpit in all the Pariſh Churches of the Citie on Sunday, and hanged on the doore of the Church, and afterwards the Metropolitane ſhould goe to the Citie vacant, and examine witneſſes concerning the qualities of the perſon; and all his letters patents and teſtifications beeing read in the Chapter, euery one ſhould be heard who would oppoſe any thing againſt his perſon; of all which an inſtrument ſhould bee made, and ſent to the Pope, to bee read in Conſiſtory. This conſtitution they ſaid would bee a cauſe of calumnies and ſeditions, and that heereby ſome authority was giuen to the people, with which they would vſurpe the election of Biſhops, which formerly they were wont to haue. Others beeing ſtirred vp herewith; made the ſame op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:17208:373"/>
againſt the Article, concerning thoſe who are to bee promoted to the greater orders, in which it was ſayd, that their names ought to bee publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to the people three Sundayes, and affixed to the doores of the Church, and that their letters teſtimoniall ought to bee ſubſcribed by foure Prieſts, and foure Laiques of the Pariſh; alleadging, that no authoritie ought to bee giuen to the Laitie in theſe affaires, which are purely Eccleſiaſticall. In theſe perplexities the Legates knew not what to doe, but to enioy the benefit of time, and to expect ſome ouerture, to come to the end of the Councell, to which they ſaw not how they ſhould be able to arriue.</p>
            <p>Another trouble beganne about the reformation of Cardinals. And the Pope vnderſtanding that this was ſpoken of in all Courts, and that in <hi>Trent,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Cardinals.</note> the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> were combined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it of the Councel, hee wrote to the Legates for aduice, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were better to handle it at <hi>Rome,</hi> or in <hi>Trent.</hi> He propoſed the ſame in Conſiſtorie, ordayning alſo a Congregation to conſult on it, and, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, to finde a meanes that Princes might not intermeddle in the <hi>Conclaue,</hi> in the election of the Pope. And, to proceede with all circumſpection in a buſineſſe of ſo great weight, hee ſent many Articles of reformation to <hi>Trent,</hi> drawen out of the Councels, with order that the Legates ſhould impart them to the principall Prelats, and ſignifie their opinions. The Cardinals of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,</hi> and <hi>Madruccio,</hi> anſwered, they would not deliuer their owne opinions, before they vnderſtood the Popes minde, and afterwards it would bee neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to thinke very much on it. And <hi>Loraine</hi> ſaid, that there are many things which are thought worthy of correction, which himſelfe did thinke could not iuſtly be reprehended, and others which might in part, but not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Hee deſcended to the particular of hauing Biſhopriques, ſaying, there was no inconuenience that a Cardinall Prieſt ſhould haue a Biſhoprique, but did not like that a Cardinall Deacon ſhould bee a Biſhop; and that, for this cauſe, hee had counſelled his brother, the Cardinall, to leaue the Arch-biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique of <hi>Sans.</hi> But this matter of reformation of the Cardinals was quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put to ſilence. For thoſe who were in <hi>Trent,</hi> inclining rather to haue it <note place="margin">Did quickely vaniſh.</note> handled by the Pope and Colledge, and thoſe who pretended for the <hi>red Cap,</hi> doubting their deſires might be croſſed, they did, with great facility, leaue to ſpeake of it. The Pope alſo thought to make a conſtitution, that no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſhould haue any temporall offices, either in <hi>Rome,</hi> or in the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Dominion. But he was aduertiſed by <hi>Simoneta,</hi> and other Prelats, that it would bee a great preiudice to the Eccleſiaſtiques of <hi>France, Polonia,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdomes, where they are Counſellers of Kings, and haue the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall offices, of which they might eaſily bee depriued, if Princes ſhould take example by his Holineſſe, and the Secular Nobility incite them to it, for their owne intereſts. Therefore if hee would execute this his determination, hee ſhould doe it in effects, and not in writing, leſt he ſhould damnifie the Clergy in other Kingdomes very much.</p>
            <p>The Emperour found by experience, either at this time, or two moneths before, when <hi>Morone</hi> was with him, that his vicinity to the Councell did not onely no good, as hee thought it would, but the contrary rather. For the popiſh Prelates, ſuſpecting his deſeignes were againſt the authority of the
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:17208:373"/>
Court, were afraid of euery thing, ſo that the difficulties and ſuſpitions did turne into bitterneſſe, and increaſe in number. Therefore hauing other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe wherein to employ himſelfe with more profit, he departed, and wrot to the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> that the impoſſiblity of doing good in the Councel being palpable, he thought it was the dutie of a Chriſtian and wife Prince, rather to ſupport the preſent euill with patience, then by curing it, to cauſe a greater. And to the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> who went vnto him by Poſt, three dayes before, he gaue order to write to the Catholike King, concerning <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror parteth from <hi>Iſorut.</hi>
               </note> the Decree <hi>Proponentibus Legatis</hi> exhorting his Maieſtie in his name to bee content not to deſire the reuocation, or declaration, and if hee did thinke that the not declaring of it might preiudice other Councels, the declaration might, if need were, be made in the end of this. And notice beeing giuen, that they conſulted at <hi>Rome</hi> and in <hi>Trent,</hi> to proceed againſt the Queene of <note place="margin">And dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Councell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Q. of <hi>England.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>England,</hi> he wrote to the Pope and the Legates, that if the Councell would not yeeld that fruit, as was deſired, that they might ſee an vnion of all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques to reforme the Church, at the leaſt they ſhould not giue occaſion to the heretickes to vnite themſelues more, which they would doe, in caſe they proceeded againſt the Queene of <hi>England.</hi> For vndoubtedly they would by that meanes make a generall league againſt the Catholikes, which would bring forth great inconueniences. And his admonition was ſo effectuall, that the Pope deſiſted in <hi>Rome,</hi> and reuoked the Commiſſion giuen to the Legats in <hi>Trent.</hi> After that the Pope had giuen diſtaſt to the Spaniards, in not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing place to the Ambaſſadours, to appeaſe them againe, he gaue care to the inſtance of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>argas,</hi> who had troubled him many dayes together deſiring that as meanes was found that the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> the Ambaſſadour of his King, might come into congregations, ſo, the time of celebrating the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on drawing neere, his Holines would find a way that he might be there alſo; Whereof hauing conſidered well, and conſulted with the Cardinals, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued finally that a place, ſeparated from the other Ambaſſadours, ſhould be giuen the Count in the Seſſion alſo, and to remedy the comperency which would be in giuing the <hi>Incenſe</hi> &amp; the <hi>pax,</hi> he gaue order that 2. <hi>Cenſers</hi> ſhould be vſed, and <hi>Incenſe</hi> giuen to the French-men, and the Spaniard both at once; as alſo two <hi>Paxes</hi> to be kiſſed at the ſame inſtant. And hee wrote to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats to doe ſo, commanding that they ſhould conceale all vntill the time of the execution, for feare ſome inconueniences might bee prepared if it were knowen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Morone,</hi> according to the Popes command, concealed the order, neither <note place="margin">A difference about prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> did the French-men know of it at all. On Saint <hi>Peters</hi> day, the 29. of Iune; the Cardinals, Ambaſſadours, and Fathers being aſſembled in the Chappell of the Cathedrall Church, and the <hi>Maſſe</hi> being begun, which the Biſhop of <hi>Aſti,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> his Ambaſſadour, did celebrate, on the ſudden a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey veluet chaire came out of the Veſtry, and was placed betweene the laſt Cardinall, and the firſt Patriarke: and by and by the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Ambaſſadour, came in, and ſat vpon it; whereat the Prelats kept a great murmuring, <hi>Loraine</hi> complained to the Legats of this ſudden act, concealed from him. The French Ambaſſadors ſent the Maſter of the Ceremonies to make the ſame complaint, telling the of them ceremonies of the <hi>Incenſe</hi> and
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:17208:374"/>
the <hi>Pax.</hi> The Legats anſwered there would be two <hi>Cenſers</hi> and two <hi>Paxes;</hi> wherewith the French were not ſatisfied, and ſaid plainely, that they would be maintained, not in paritie, but in precedence, and would proteſt againſt euery innouation, and depart from the Councell. Theſe goings and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings continued vntill the end of the Goſpel, ſo that the Epiſtle and Goſpel were not heard, by reaſon of the great whiſperings. The Theologue being gone into the Pulpit to preach, the Legats, with the Cardinals, Ambaſſadors of the Emperour, and <hi>de Ferrieres,</hi> one of the French, retired into the Veſtry, where this matter was handled, and the Sermon was ended before any thing was concluded. In the midſt of the <hi>Credo</hi> a ſilence was made, and <hi>Madruccio,</hi> with <hi>Fiue Churches,</hi> and the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Polonia,</hi> came out to ſpeake with the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> and to pray him in the name of the Legats, that, for that time, hee would bee content, that neither <hi>Incenſe</hi> nor the <hi>Paxe</hi> ſhould be giuen to any, to hinder this ſudden tumult, which might cauſe ſome great euill, promiſing that, at any other time when hee requeſted, they would execute the order of his holineſſe of two <hi>Cenſors</hi> and two <hi>Paxes</hi> at once, which being conſidered on before hand, both hee and they, and all might be able to reſolue how to gouerne themſelues with wiſedome. After long diſcourſe, they returned with this reſolution that the Count was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. So they all came out of the Veſtry, and went to their places, and the Maſſe proceeded without <hi>Incenſe</hi> or <hi>Paxe.</hi> And as ſcone as theſe words were ſaid; <hi>Ite, miſſaeſt,</hi> the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> who, in the Congregations, was wont to goe out laſt, did goe then before the Croſſe, followed with a great part of the Spaniſh Prelats, and <hi>Italians,</hi> ſubiect to his King. Afterwards the Legat, Ambaſſadours, and reſidue of the Prelats departed alſo, after the vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner.</p>
            <p>The Legats, to bee freed from the imputation layd vpon them for this ſecret, and almoſt fraudulent proceeding, n a matter of ſo great weight, were faine to publiſh the expreſſe orders, receiued from <hi>Rome,</hi> to doe ſo in that time, in that maner, and without participation of any. <hi>De Ferrieres</hi> ſaid pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, that but for the reſpect he bare to the worſhip of God, hee would haue proteſted, as he had in commiſſion from his King, which he would doe hereafter, in caſe the vſuall ceremonies of <hi>Incenſe</hi> and <hi>paxe</hi> were not reſtored, and giuen them in their due place. The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> alſo wrote a ſharpe letter to the Pope, declaring the wrong that ſhould haue beene done them, and ſaid modeſtly, that his Holineſſe had made him bee told that hee truſted ſo much in him, that hee would that all the affaires of the Councell ſhould be communicated vnto him; whereof, though he ſaw no effect, yet he did not complaine; but he was troubled that he had commanded the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats not to impart vnto him their owne proper affaires, and eſpecially, that, in which he might haue done more good then another, adding, that more miſchiefe had inſued, but for his mediation. Hee ſayde moreouer, that the blame of all was imputed to his Holineſſe, and prayed him that he would not be the authour and cauſe of ſo great an euill. Hee ſent <hi>Muſottus</hi> vnto him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, by poſt, to informe him more particularly of the reſolution of the French Ambaſſadours, and of the imminent danger. The Count of <hi>Luna</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the ſtiffeneſſe of the French Ambaſſadours, and magnified his owne
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:17208:374"/>
great patience, and modeſtie, and deſired the Legates, that the next Sunday he might be admitted to equall place, &amp; ceremonies, according to the Popes order. Some thought it was a ſtratagem of the Pope to diſſolue the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; and the Papalins, called <hi>Amoreuoli,</hi> ſaid, that, if they muſt come to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, they deſired it ſhould rather happen for the controuerſie about the words of the Councell of <hi>Florence, That the Pope is Rector of the Church vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſall;</hi> thinking it would be more eaſie to iuſtifie his Holineſſe in that, and to lay all the blame vpon the French-men.</p>
            <p>The next morning, the laſt of Iune, the Count hauing aſſembled the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Prelats, and many Italians, told them, that the day before hee went into the Chappell, not to giue occaſion of any diſturbance, but to keep the right of his King, and make vſe of the Popes order; that ſince he had vnderſtood, that, in caſe he ſhould returne to the Chappel againe, the French-men would proteſt: which if they ſhould doe, hee muſt not faile to anſwere them, in the ſame maner and termes that they ſhould vſe, as in regard of his Holineſſe, ſo alſo in the behalfe of the Maieſtie of his King. The Prelats anſwered, that if it came to this, they would be readie to doe his Holineſſe ſeruice, and not faile to hold eſteeme of his Catholique Maieſtie as farre as did concerne them. The Count prayed them againe to conſider well of all which might happen in ſuch a caſe; ſaying, that himſelfe would come prepared alſo. And know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the French-men could take but three courſes, either againſt the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, or againſt the King, or againſt him the Ambaſſadour, hee meant to be prouided for an anſwere for all. All the Ambaſſadours of other Princes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Legats to find a temper; that ſo great diſorder might not happen: who anſwering, that they muſt needs execute the Popes command, which was preciſe, and without any reſeruation, and the rather becauſe they had promiſed the Count to doe it whenſoeuer he would requeſt it, the Cardinal of <hi>Loraine</hi> proteſted to them, that, in caſe they did ſo, hee would goe into the pulpit, and ſhew of what importance the matter was, and what a ruine it would bring to all Chriſtendome, and with the crucifixe in hand, would cry, <hi>Miſericordia,</hi> perſwading the Fathers and people to goe out of the Church, that they might not ſee ſo fearefull a ſchiſme, and crying, <hi>Hee that deſires the welfare of Chriſtendome, let him follow me,</hi> would depart out of the Church ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping he ſhould be followed by euery one. The Legats mooued heerewith, perſwaded the Count to be content that no Chappell ſhould be helde the next Sunday, nor any proceſſion made, according to the vſe, and ſent the Pope aduiſe of all.</p>
            <p>Continuall congregations were held in the houſe of the French and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Ambaſſadours.

cauſe of ſchiſme, and for another cauſe alſo, appealing vnto the future Pope, lawfully elected, and to a true and lawfull councell, threatning to depart, and to celebrate a Nationall. The Prelats, and other Frenchmen apart, did commonly ſay to euery one, that the Ambaſſadors had proteſtations againſt the perſon of the Biſhop, who caryed himſelfe for Pope, being not lawfull becauſe there was a nullitie in the election for <hi>Simonie,</hi> intimating particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the obligation which Cardinall <hi>Caraffa</hi> had from the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi>

In concluſion, he commanded the Prelates and Diuines, in the Kings name, to depart, and to returne when GOD ſhould reſtore the due forme and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to generall Councels, and the King receiue his due place.</p>
            <p>But there was no occaſion to proteſt. For the Count conſidered finally, that, howſoeuer the Spaniſh party was greater, in number of Prelats, then the French, yet, becauſe the dependants of the Pope, who at the firſt were on this ſide, when they vnderſtood the will of his Holines, would now, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a diſpatch was made to <hi>Rome</hi> for this cauſe, thinke fit he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt vntill the anſwere and the new order came, and therefore ioyne with the French, his ſide would prooue to bee the weaker. Therefore inclining to a compoſition, and all the other Ambaſſadours, and the Cardinall <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druccio</hi> interpoſing, after many difficulties, they agreed that neither <hi>Incenſe</hi> nor the <hi>Pax</hi> ſhould be giuen in the publique ceremonies, vntill the anſwere of the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> did come. This accord diſpleaſed the Popes depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, who would haue beene glad of that occaſion to interrupt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of the Councell, as alſo thoſe, who beeing weary of <hi>Trent,</hi> and nor ſeeing how the Councell could either proceed or be ended, deſired the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, as the leſſer euill, that the diſcords might not increaſe. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that the Pope himſelfe, receiuing aduice of this compoſition, did take it ill, in regard of the ſame feare, that the diſcords may not bee made grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſome euill en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>de. And the Spaniſh miniſters in <hi>Italy</hi> did all blame the Count, for letting ſlippe ſo fauourable an occaſion for the ſeruice, of the King.</p>
            <p>This controuerſie being compoſed, the Legats, intent vpon the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">How the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in the points for the next Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued.</note> of the Seſſion, becauſe the time approched, conſulted what might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="732" facs="tcp:17208:376"/>
ſay nothing, but what concerneth the power of <hi>Order.</hi> To ſome of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palins this ſeemed a good remedie, but to others not; who ſaid, that this would bee attributed to the Pope, as if the forme laſt compoſed did not pleaſe him, and the Princes would wonder, why his Holines ſhould not reſt content, hauing the ſame power giuen him, which Saint. <hi>Peter</hi> had; which would haue giuen matter of diſcourſe to the heretiques. Beſides, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would take occaſion to haue little hope hereafter to agree together in any thing; whence infinite difficulties would ariſe in other matters alſo. Moreouer there might bee a doubt whether it could be effected, becauſe it was probable that many of the Fathers. Would require, that thoſe Articles ſhould bee declared. The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> offered that the Frenchmen ſhould not require it, and ſo to labour with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that they alſo ſhould be content; adding, that, in caſe the Legats would doe the like with the <hi>Italians,</hi> who doe with too much paſſion oppoſe the others, all would bee compoſed.</p>
            <p>And very fitly order camefrom the Emperour to his Ambaſſadours, to vſe all meanes that the authoritie of the Pope ſhould not bee diſcuſſed in Councell; which his Maieſtie did, becauſe hee ſaw the <hi>maior</hi> part was incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to enlarge it, and feared that ſomething might bee determined, which might make his concord with the Proteſtants more difficult. The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, hauing treated with the Legats in conformitie hereof, as alſo with <hi>Loraine,</hi> and other principall Prelates, did cauſe this Article to bee omitted, as alſo that other of the Inſtitution of Biſhops. But firſt they made many conſultations about it, admitting vnto them the Prelates which were of greateſt note, and had moſt followers, ſometimes more, ſometimes fewer, that they might ſo diſpoſe of matters; as that all might reſt contented, and the Decrees of the prouiſions made againſt the abuſes were giuen ſorth Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt point, which was of the election of Biſhops; the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portugall</hi> did ſharply oppoſe this particular, that the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans ſhould examine the perſons promoted to Biſhoprikes (whereof much hath beene ſaid before) ſaying, that this was to ſubiect the Kings to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats their ſubiects, becauſe authoritie was indirectly giuen them, to reiect the Kings nominations. The French Ambaſſadors beeing demanded what their opinion was, made ſhew they did not c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon the Popiſh Prelats, who thought it as diminution to the Popes authoritie, ſayd, that all that point might bee omitted: eſpecially, becauſe, in the fift Seſſion, ſufficient prouiſion was made in that matter. But o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers oppoſing hotely, a concluſion was made by common conſent, that it ſhould bee deforred vntill the next Seſſion, that they might haue time ſo to diſpoſe it, as that it might pleaſe all, leaſt the publication of the things agreed on ſhould be croſſed, in regard of this.</p>

Which was, that not onely it ſhould bee required of them who were deſigned to Biſhoprikes, and other cures of ſoules, but alſo an admonition and precept, in vertue of obedience, made to all Princes of what Maieſtie or excellencie ſoeuer, not to admit to any dignitie, magiſtracie, or office, any perſon, before they haue made inquiſition of his Faith and religion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee hath voluntarily confeſſed and ſworne the Articles, contained in that forme which, to that end, it did command to bee tranſlated into the vulgar tongue, and publikely read euery Sunday, in all the Churches, that it might bee vnderſtood by all. The Articles were. To receiue the Scriptures of both Teſtaments, which the Church doth hold to bee canonicall, as inſpired by God. To acknowledg the holy Catholike Apoſtolike Church, vnder one Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Vicar</hi> of CHRIST, holding conſtantly the faith and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thereof, in regard, being directed by the holy Ghoſt, it cannot erre. To haue in veneration the authority of Councels, as certaine and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not to doubt of the things once determned by them. To beleeue, with a conſtant faith, the Eccleſiaſticall traditions, receiued from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To follow the opinion and conſent of the Orthodoxe Fathers. To render abſolute obedience to the conſtitutions and precepts of the holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church. To beleeue, and confeſſe the ſeuen Sacraments, and their vſe, vertue, and fruit, as the Church hath taught vntill this time, but aboue all, that in the Sacrament of the Altar there is the true body and blood of CHRIST, really and ſubſtantially, vnder the Bread and Wine, by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power of the word of God, vttered by the Prieſt, the onely miniſter ordained to this purpoſe, by the inſtitution of CHRIST; confeſſing alſo that hee is offered in the Maſſe to God, for the liuing and the dead, for the remiſſion of ſinnes. And finally to receiue and retaine moſt firmely all things which haue beene vntill this time piouſly and religiouſly obſerued by their anceſtours, nor to bee remooued from them by any meanes, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide all nouity of doctrine, as a moſt pernicious poyſon, flying all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

            <p>It being (as hath beene ſayd) reſolued to omit this matter, they laboured to rectifie the matter of Reſidence, by taking away whatſoeuer might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe thoſe who held it to bee, <hi>de iure Diuino,</hi> or thoſe who thought it to bee, <hi>de iure Poſitino.

doore-keeper. This was compoſed in the beginning by the Deputies, when the Decrees were made, as neceſſarie to oppoſe againſt the Proteſtants, who ſay thoſe <hi>Orders</hi> were not inſtituted by CHRIST, but by Eccleſiaſticall introduction, becauſe there is vſe of them, as being offices of good and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly gouernement, but not Sacraments. This Article of the Deeree was taken out of the <hi>Pontificall,</hi> which would be too long and ſuperfluous to repeat, in regard it may be read in the booke it ſelfe. And the Decree did <note place="margin">The functions of the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Orders.</hi>
               </note> declare beſides, that thoſe functions cannot be excerciſed but by him, who, being promoted by the Biſhop hath receiued grace from God, and a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> imprinted, to make him able to doe it. But when it came to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, they were troubled to reſolue an olde common obiection, what neede there could bee of a <hi>Character,</hi> and ſpirituall grace, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe corporall Actes, as to reade, light candles, ring bels, which may bee as well or better done by thoſe who are not ordained; eſpecially ſince it hath beene diſuſed, that men ordained ſhould exerciſe thoſe functions. It was conſidered, that the Church was condemned hereby for omitting this vſe, ſo many yeeres. And there was a difficultie how to reſtore the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of them. For they muſt ordaine, not children, but men of age to ſhut the Church doores, to ring the bells, to diſpoſſeſſe the poſſeſſed with deuils: which if they did, they did croſſe another Decree, that the inferiour orders ſhould be a neceſſarie degree to the greater. Neither did they ſee how they could reſtore the three offices to the Deaconſhip, to miniſter at the Altar, to Baptize, and to preach, nor how the office of the Exorciſts could bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, in regard of the vſe brought in, that the Prieſts onely did diſpoſſeſſe the poſſeſſed. <hi>Antonius Auguſtinus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lerida,</hi> would haue had that whole matter omitted, ſaying that, howſoeuer it was certaine that theſe were <hi>Orders,</hi> and Sacraments, yet it would bee hard to perſwade that they were brought in in the Primitiue Church, when there were but few Chriſtians; that it was not for the Synods dignitie, to deſcend to ſo many particulars; that it was ſufficient to ſay, there are foure inferiour <hi>Orders,</hi> without deſcending to any further ſpeciali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie of doctrine, or making any innouation in the practiſe. Oppoſition was made, that ſo the doctrine of the Proteſtants, who call them idle Ceremonies, would not be condemned. But <hi>Loraine</hi> was Authour of a middle courſe, that the Article ſhould be omitted, and in few words the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution referred to the Biſhop, who ſhould cauſe them to bee obſerued, as much as was poſſible.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſetled, they reſolued to reade all in the conſultation of thoſe principall Prelates, that all things might paſſe in the generall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation with abſolute quiet.

            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe two contradictions, matters were eſtabliſhed with the other principall Prelates; and the ninth of Iuly the generall Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations began; in which all that belongeth to the doctrine and Canones of <hi>Order</hi> being firſt read, the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> gaue an example of ſpeaking briefly, and making no difficultie: and was imitated by others, vntill it came to <hi>Granata</hi> to ſpeake; who ſaid, it was an indignitie, that the Fathers <note place="margin">The Spaniſh Prelats are conſtant in their opinion co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Inſtitution of Biſhops.</note> ſhould bee thus derided, handling the foundation of the Inſtitution of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſo long, and now omitting it; requiring the declaration, <hi>de iure diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and wondring why a point ſo true and infallible, ſhould not bee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

<pb n="736" facs="tcp:17208:378"/>
hee required a declaration to the contrarie, repeating the conceipt often v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that a Church and faithfull ſubiects were as eſſentiall to a Biſhop, as a wife to an huſband. The Decree of Reſidence being propoſed afterwards, <hi>Loraine</hi> did approoue it with the ſame breuitie; onely hee aduiſed, that where the cauſes of abſence are expreſſed, amongſt which is vtility of the Church, vtility of the Common-wealth ſhould bee added alſo, to remooue all impediment which that Decree might bring to the admiſſion of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to offices and publique Councels; wherein he had a generall applauſe, <hi>Madruccio,</hi> who followed, ſpake in the ſame manner. The Patriarke of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and the Archbiſhops <hi>Verallo,</hi> and <hi>Otranto</hi> refuſed to deliuer their opinions concerning that Decree: whereof the Archbiſhop <hi>Braga,</hi> when his turne was to ſpeake, complained, and turning to the Legates, told them, after a reprehending manner, that they ought to vſe their authoritie, and to force the Prelates to ſpeake their opinions, and that it was a bad example in Councell, as if they were compelled to bee ſilent, or had an ambition not to ſpeake but when they had followers. Whereupon others, who reſolued to imitate them, changed their purpoſe, and conſented to the Decree. The other Decrees were approoued as they were read, but onely that <hi>Granata</hi> made inſtance that Reſidence might bee declared to bee <hi>de iure diuino</hi> in plaine words, becauſe (hee ſaid) the ambiguous words of the Proheme were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Councell, which was aſſembled to take away, and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the difficulties; that bookes maintaining the contrary ſhould bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited and that Cardinals ſhould expreſly and namely bee comprehended in the Decree. This laſt concerning Cardinals, did ſeeme to pleaſe many. Whereupon <hi>Morone</hi> anſwered, that conſideration ſhould bee had of it, and that it ſhould be ſpoken of another time. They proceeded in the reſidue, and, in the end, the Patriarch and the two Archbiſhops conſented alſo to the Decree; which was the firſt thing to make them hope that the Seſſion could be celebrated at the time appointed, a thing thought impoſſible, but effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, by the dexterity of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The dayes following the Fathers gaue their voyces concerning the other Articles of reformation. In which there was no difference of moment, but onely, that, at the great inſtance of <hi>Pompeius Zambeccari,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,</hi> one particle was remooued out of the Articles of the firſt <hi>Tonſure;</hi> in which it was ſaid, that, if the promoted ſhall committe any delict within ſixe moneths after the ordination, the ordination ſhall bee preſumed to bee fraudulent, and the ordained ſhall not enioy the priuiledge of the Court; and whereas it is decreed that none ſhould bee ordained before hee was appropriated to ſome Church, the innouation of the Decrees made by the <hi>Later an</hi> Councell was added, that thoſe alſo who were ordained to the title of the Patrimonie ſhould bee applied to the ſeruice of ſome Church, in which they ſhould actually exerciſe themſelues, or otherwiſe ſhould not bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the priuiledges. This laſt was taken away alſo: and for the reſidue, with a ſmall variation of words, and thoſe not belonging to the ſubſtance, ſatisfaction was giuen to all the Fathers.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards, who could not obtaine in Congregation the declaration for the inſtitution of Biſhops as they deſired, did the thirteenth day at night,

               </gap>ed him to proteſt to the Legates, in caſe the determination of that point ſhould bee omitted; but others diſſwaded it, as a thing which might raiſe a great commotion. The whole Congregation was ſpent in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and ended in contention, deferring the reſolution vntill the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. When the Count, hearing againe the diuerſitie of opinions, and conſidering that it would much diſpleaſe the Pope, all the Italian Biſhops, and all the French men, who had reformed their opinions, prayed <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> to thinke as others did, in regard it was not a matter of conſcience, becauſe the queſtion was not in what manner it ſhould bee refined, but whether it ſhould be refined, or omitted. <hi>Granata</hi> not changing, but ſaying that hee thought in his conſcience the determination was neceſſary, hee deſired him that hee would ſpeake his opinion quietly, and freely, and content himſelfe if it were not embraced by others, and abſtaine from contentions; which both hee and the others promiſed to doe.</p>
            <p>The next day, which was the next before the Seſſion, a generall congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation was held, in which <hi>Morone</hi> did propoſe; whether the Fathers were pleaſed that in the Articles of Reſidence, and of the age of thoſe who are to bee ordained, mention ſhould bee made of Cardinals; and particularly of the age. Few did conſent, and moſt of them did diſcourſe that there is no cauſe to make any Cardinals vnder age, except Princes, in whom age is not conſiderable, becauſe they doe honour the Clergy, of what age ſoeuer they bee; and that it was to no purpoſe to make a Decree where there was no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe. But in the particular of the reſidence, the greater part was of opinion they ſhould bee named. But ſome contradicted, becauſe it would bee an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation that Cardinals might haue Biſhopriques, and, by conſequence, <hi>Commendaes;</hi> which was not fit to doe, but to leaue them to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which muſt needes tell them that they are not exempt from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall precept, rather then by naming them, to approoue two abuſes at once, plurality of Benefices, and <hi>Commendaes.</hi> Afterwards ſome other particulars of ſmall weight beeing handled and concluded, all which was to bee publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Seſſion was read againe, the Prelates giuing their opinions onely with the word, <hi>placet.</hi> Some Spaniards and Italians, in number twenty eight, anſwered negatiuely, and the others, being 192. did conſent; and in the end <hi>Morone</hi> concluded, that the Seſſion ſhould be held. He thanked the Fathers for accepting the Decrees, and exhorted the others to ioine with them, and prayed the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> to perſwade his Prelats, that, ſeeing the vniuerſall concourſe of all the Councell in one opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would not diſſent. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſpeaking with him more particularly, after the congregation, he promiſed, that, whenſoeuer the Popes authority ſhould bee declared, according to the forme of the Councell of <hi>Florence,</hi> the inſtitution of Biſhops ſhould bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared alſo to bee <hi>de iure diuino.</hi> The Spaniſh Prelates beeing aſſembled that day at night, in the houſe of the Count, after many diſcourſes, grounding themſelues vpon the Cardinals promiſe, were content to accept all things.</p>
            <p>The fifteenth of Iuly beeing come, they went all to Church early in the <note place="margin">The Seſſion.</note> morning with the vſuall order; where the accuſtomed ceremonies were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:17208:379"/>
The Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> ſang Maſſe, and the Biſhop of <hi>Aliffe</hi> preached, and did offend the French-men, by naming the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> before their King; as alſo the Polonians, by naming <hi>Portugall</hi> before <hi>Polonia;</hi> and the Venetians, by mentioning the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> before their <hi>Republique.</hi> He ſeemed to ſay alſo, that the celebration of the Councell, was a continuation with the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iulius;</hi> wherein the Imperialiſts and French-men had ill ſatisfaction. He ſpake alſo of the faith and manners of the heretikes and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes; and ſaid, that as the faith of the Catholiques was better, ſo the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques did exceede them in good life; which did giue much diſtaſte, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <note place="margin">The preacher oſtendeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours.</note> to thoſe who remembred the ſaying of our Sauiour, and of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> that faith is not ſhewed but by workes. At that inſtant nothing was ſayd, for feare of troubling the ceremonies. But the next day, the French Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, the Polonian and the Venetians, deſired the Legats that the Sermon might not be printed, nor put amongſt the acts of the Councell. The Maſſe, and the other prayers being ended, the Briefes of the Legation of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals <hi>Morone</hi> and <hi>Nauaggero</hi> were read, as alſo the <hi>Mandats</hi> of the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> of the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> the letter of the Queene of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the <hi>Mandate</hi> of the Catholique King. Afterwards the Decrees of the doctrine of faith were read; in which there was no contradiction, but onely that the maior part of the Spaniards ſayd, they did conſent vpon condition, that the Lords the Legates, ſhould performe the promiſe made to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of their King.</p>
            <p>The Decree of faith did containe in ſubſtance. 1. The Sacrifice and the Prieſthood, are vnited in each law; therefore there beeing a viſible ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <note place="margin">The Decree of faith.</note> in the New Teſtament, that is the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> it muſt be confeſſed neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that there is a viſible and externall Prieſthood, in which power is giuen, by diuine inſtitution, to conſecrate, offer, and miniſter the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and to remit and retaine ſinnes. 2. Which Prieſthood beeing diuine, muſt haue many <hi>Orders</hi> of Miniſters to ſerue in it, which muſt aſcend from lower to higher miniſteries, becauſe the Scripture maketh mention of the name of Deacons; and from the beginning of the Church the miniſteries of Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, <hi>Accolythites, Exorciſts, Readers,</hi> &amp; <hi>Oſtiaries</hi> were vſed, placing the ſubdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſhip amongſt the greater <hi>Orders.</hi> 3. And becauſe grace is conferred in the holy ordination, <hi>Order</hi> is truly and properly one of thé ſeauen Sacraments of the Church. 4 In which a <hi>Character</hi> beeing imprinted, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be blotted out, the Synode doth condemne thoſe who ſay that Prieſts haue <hi>ſacerdotal</hi> power for a time, ſo that they may returne to the world, and not exerciſe the miniſtery of the word of God. And doth condemne thoſe who ſay all Chriſtians are Prieſts, or haue equall ſpirituall power; which is nothing but to confound the Eccleſiaſticall <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> which is in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as an armie of ſouldiers. To which <hi>Hierarchicall</hi> order doe belong eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Biſhops, who are ſuperiour to Prieſts, to whom it appertaineth to adminiſter the Sacrament of <hi>Confirmation,</hi> to ordaine Miniſters, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme other functions. The Synode doth teach alſo, that, in the ordination of Biſhops, Prieſts, and other degrees, the conſent, vocation, or authority of the Magiſtrate, or of any other ſecular power is not neceſſary; and that thoſe, who, called onely, or inſtituted by the people, ſecular power or Magiſtrate,
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:17208:379"/>
or by their owne temeritie, doe aſcend to Eccleſiaſticall Miniſteries, are not Miniſters, but theeues.</p>
            <p>This doctrine was attended with eight <hi>Anathematiſmes.</hi> 1. Againſt him that ſhall ſay, that there is no viſible Prieſthood in the new Teſtament, nor any power to conſecrate and offer, and remit ſinnes, but onely an Office, or naked Miniſtery to preach the Goſpel, and that thoſe who doe not preach are not Prieſts. 2. Or that, beſides Prieſthood, there are not greater <hi>Orders,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſmes.</note> and leſſe, which are degrees to aſcend to Prieſthood. 3. Or that holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is not a Sacrament, but an humane inuention, or onely a certaine Rite, to elect Miniſters of the word of God, and of the Sacraments. 4. Or that the holy Ghoſt is not giuen by the holy Ordination, nor any <hi>Character</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, or that a Prieſt may returne to bee a Laique. 5. Or that the holy Vnction, or other Ceremonies which the Church vſeth, are not requiſite, but may be omitted, or are pernicious. 6. Or that there is not an <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie</hi> inſtituted in the Catholique Church; by diuine Ordination, conſiſting of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Miniſters. 7. Or that Biſhops are not Superiour, to Prieſts, or haue not power to confirme and ordaine, or that Prieſts alſo haue the ſame power, or that <hi>Orders</hi> conferred without the conſent or voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, or Secular power, are voyd, or that they may be lawfull Miniſters of the word of God and Sacraments, who are not lawfully orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Eccleſiaſticall power. 8. Or that Biſhops aſſumed by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Pope, are not lawfull and true, but that it is an humane inuention.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the decree of reformation was read, which contained eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene <note place="margin">The Decree of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> heads. The firſt concerning the matter of Reſidence, ſo much diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on, in which it was ſayd, that euery one that hath cure of foules, is bound, by the Commandement of God, to know his ſheepe, to offer Sacrifices for them, to feede them with preaching, Sacraments, and good examples, and to attend other Paſtorall charges; which things becauſe they cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by him who doeth not aſſiſt and watch ouer the flocke, the Synode doeth admoniſh them to feede and gouerne, with iudgement and trueth. But that none by a badde interpretation of the Conſtitutions, made vnder <hi>Paul</hi> the third in this matter, may thinke the abſence of fiue Moneths lawfull, it doeth declare, that whoſoeuer hath Biſhoprickes, in what title ſoeuer, though Cardinals, are bound to reſide perſonally, nor may bee abſent, but when Chriſtian charitie, vrgent neceſſitie, due obedience, or vtility of Church or Common-wealth doth require; as alſo that ſuch cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of abſence muſt bee approoued for lawfull, by the Pope, or Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane, except they bee notorious or ſudden, in which caſe the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Councels muſt take knowledge, and iudge of the licences graunted, that there may bee no abuſe therein, the Prelates prouiding that the people may not be damnified in their abſence. And becauſe a ſhort abſence deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not this name, though without any the cauſes aforeſayd, it doeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that this ſhall not exceede the ſpace of two moneths, or three at the moſt, whether it be continuate or at diuers times, ſo that there be equity of reaſon in it, and without the dammage of the flocke; which muſt be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the conſciences of the Prelats; admoniſhing euery one not to be abſent on Sundayes in <hi>Aduent, Lent,</hi> Feaſt of the <hi>Natiuitie, Reſurrection, Pentecoſt,</hi> or
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:17208:380"/>
               <hi>Corpus Chriſti.</hi> Which Decree, he that ſhall violate, beſides the penalties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vpon <hi>Non-reſidents</hi> vnder <hi>Paul</hi> the third, and mortall ſinne, may not, with a good conſcience, enioy the Fruits for that proportion of time, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing the ſame concerning all thoſe that haue charge of ſoules, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſent with leaue of the Biſhop, muſt ſubſtitute a ſufficient Vicar, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued by the Biſhop, allowing a conuenient ſtipend; and doeth ordaine that this Deceee, together with the other vnder <hi>Paul</hi> the third, ſhall bee pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the Prouinciall and Dioceſan Councels.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Article of the Decree concerning <hi>Order,</hi> was; That whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer doeth hold a Biſhopricke, in what title ſoeuer, though a Cardinall, not receiuing conſecration within three moneths, ſhall loſe the Fruits, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring three moneths more, ſhall loſe the Benefice, and that the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if it bee not in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall bee celebrated in the proper Church, or in the Prouince at the leaſt, if there be opportunitie. The third, That Biſhops ſhall celebrate the ordinations in their owne perſon, and, in caſe they be ſicke, ſhall not ſend their ſubiects to bee ordained by other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, before they bee examined and approoued by themſelues. The fourth, That the firſt <hi>Tonſure</hi> ſhall not bee giuen but to him that is confirmed, and hath learned the principles of Faith, to reade and write, and hath choſen a Clericall life to ſerue GOD, not to auoyd the Secular iudgement. The fift, He that is to be promoted to the inferiour <hi>Orders</hi> ſhall haue teſtimonie from the Pariſh Prieſt, and Schoolemaſter, and charge ſhall bee giuen by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, that his name may bee propoſed publikely in Church, and inquiſition made of his birth, age, manners and life. The ſixth, That none ſhall haue an Eccleſiaſticall Benefice before the age of fourteene yeeres, nor enioy the exemption of the tribunall, if he haue not an Eccleſiaſticall Benefice, or, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the habit and <hi>Tonſure,</hi> doeth not ſerue in ſome Church, by commiſſion from the Biſhop, or dwell in a Seminary, or Schoole, or Vniuerſitie, with licence of the Biſhop. And, for married Clerkes, the conſtitution of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth ſhal be obſerued, with condition likewiſe that they ſhal ſerue in the Church, in habit and <hi>Tonſure,</hi> by deputation of the Biſhop. The ſeuenth, That when an ordination is to be made, all ſhal be called to the Citie, the Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day before, and diligent inquiſition and examination of them made by the Biſhop, with the aſſiſtance of who he pleaſeth. The eighth, Ordinations ſhall not be celebrated but in times appointed by the law, in the cathedral Church, in preſence of the Canons: and if occaſion bee to make it in an other place of the Dioceſſe, it ſhall bee in the moſt worthy Church, in preſence of the Clergie. Euery one ſhall be ordained by his owne Biſhop, or, if any bee or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by another, he ſhall haue letters teſtimoniall of his owne. The ninth, A Biſhop ſhall not ordaine one of his family that is not his ſubiect, if he haue not dwelt with him three yeeres, and, in that caſe, ſhall preſently conferre a Benefice vpon him. The tenth, No Abbat, or other Prelate, ſhall conferre the firſt <hi>Tonſure,</hi> or the minor <hi>Orders,</hi> but vnto Regulars, their ſubiects; nor theſe or other Prelats, Colledges, or Chapters, ſhall grant dimiſſorie letters to Secular Clerkes to receiue <hi>Orders.</hi> The eleuenth, That the minor <hi>Orders</hi> ſhall be conferred vpon him that vnderſtandeth the Latine tongue, and with interpoſition of time betweene one <hi>Order</hi> and another; and theſe being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:17208:380"/>
vnto others, none ſhall be ordained if there be not hope that hee may bee worthy of holy orders; and from the laſt of the minor <hi>Orders</hi> vntill the Subdeaconſhip, there ſhall be the interpoſition of a yeere, if the Biſhop ſhall not iudge otherwiſe for the good of the Church. The twelfth, None ſhall be ordained <hi>Subdeacon</hi> before the age of two and twenty yeeres, <hi>Deacon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore three and twenty, <hi>Prieſt</hi> before ſixe and twenty.

            <p>In the end, the Decree, intimating the next Seſſion for the ſixteenth of September, was read, expreſſing that then the Sacrament of Matrimony was to bee handled, and other things pertaining to the doctrine of Faith, as alſo the prouiſions of Biſhoprickes, Dignities, and other Benefices, and diuers other articles of reformation. The Seſſion continued from nine vntill ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene a clocke, with great content of the Legates and Popiſh Prelates, that matters did paſſe ſo quietly, and with ſuch a generall conſent; And they commended the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> aboue all, confeſſing that he had beene the moſt principall cauſe of this benefit.</p>

And thoſe who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Theologie, did deſire that it ſhould be once declared, what the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell did vnderſtand by the power of retaining ſins, which was made one part of the Sacerdotall power; becauſe they had declared the ſence of the other, which was to remit ſinnes And others wondered at the declaration, that the inferiour <hi>Orders</hi> are onely degrees vnto the ſuperiour, and all vnto Prieſt-hood, in regard it doth appeare, in the ancient Eccleſiaſticall Storie, that thoſe who were ordained to any miniſtery or charge, were, for the moſt part, perpetually entertained in the ſame, and the aſcending to an higher degree happened very ſeldome, and was vſed onely in caſe of neceſſitie, or great vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie. None of the ſeuen Deacons inſtituted by the Apoſtles, aſcended any higher; and in the ancient Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe it doth not appeare, that the Deacons, whoſe office was to heare the confeſſions of Martyrs, did paſſe to the title of Prieſthood. The ordination of Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to bee a Biſhop, of Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paulinus</hi> to bee Prieſts, and of Saint <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Great to be a Deacon is deſcribed, without mention of any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by other degrees. They did not blame the vſe begun in later times, but they marueiled that they did alleadge it as a thing alwayes vſed, whereas the contrary was manifeſt.</p>
            <p>The Decree, that the miniſteries of the <hi>Orders</hi> from a <hi>Deacon</hi> to an <hi>Oſtiary</hi> ſhould not bee exerciſed, but by perſons promoted to thoſe proper <hi>Orders,</hi> made a faire ſhew; but it ſeemed a thing hard to bee obſerued, that, in no
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:17208:381"/>
Church none might ring the bels, or open and ſhut the doores, but the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie <hi>Oſtiaries,</hi> nor light the lamps, and candles, but the <hi>Accolites,</hi> who were to exerciſe thoſe manuall functions, that they might aſcend to Prieſt-hood. And it ſeemed ſome contradiction, to haue determined abſolutely, that thoſe miniſteries ſhould not bee exerciſed but by perſons ordained, and afterward commanded the Prelats to reſtore them, as much as conueniently they could. For obſeruing the abſolute Decree, it is very neceſſary; that, where perſons ordained cannot be had for exerciſe of thoſe functions, they muſt not be exerciſed at all: and if they may bee exerciſed without <hi>Orders,</hi> in places where perſons ordayned cannot bee found, the abſolute definition might haue better been omitted. In the Decree of the ordination of Prieſts, it was thought very conuenient to preſcribe that condition, that they ſhould he able to teach the people; but this did not ſeeme very coherent with that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doctrine and vſe, that cure of ſoules is not eſſentiall to Prieſthood, ſo that to bee able to teach the people is not neceſſary to thoſe Prieſts who meane neuer to take that cure vpon them. And to make to a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the minor orders, to vnderſtand the Latine tongue; was to ſhew that this was not a Generall Councell of all Chriſtian Nations, in regard this Decree could not be vniuerſall, and binde the Nations of <hi>Africa, Aſia,</hi> and of a great part of <hi>Europe,</hi> where the Latine tongue neuer had place.</p>
            <p>The ſixth <hi>Anathematiſme</hi> was much noted in <hi>Germany;</hi> in which an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of faith was made of <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> which word and ſignification thereof is aliene, not to ſay contrary to the holy Scriptures; and though it was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what anciently inuented, yet the authour is not knowne; and in caſe he were, yet he is an Hyperbolicall writer, not imitated in the vſe of that word, nor of others of his inuention, by any of the ancients: and following the ſtile of CHRIST our LORD, and of the holy <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and Primitiue Church, it ought to be named not <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> but <hi>Hierodiaconia,</hi> or <hi>Hierodoulia.</hi> And <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Paul Vergerius</hi> in <hi>Valtelina</hi> did make this and other obiections againſt the <note place="margin">

which hee had very often told them that hee was of their opinion, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to labour effectually to cauſe that doctrine to bee decreed without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any condition. They added that there was no hope he would bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in any other promiſe, and that the Pope by making him beleeue hee ſhould bee Legate of <hi>France,</hi> had wonne him. And other things they ſaid, which were little for his honour. On the other ſide hee iuſtified himſelfe, ſaying, that the offer was made vnto him to make his friends miſtruſt him, and that his anſwere was, that hee would not hearken vnto it, before are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation were made in Councell. Notwithſtanding it was not beleeued that hee would perſeuere in the ſame opinion, no not ſo much as in this matter.</p>
            <p>The Legates, deſirous to finiſh the Councell, did, ſo ſoone as the Seſſion was done, vſe meanes to facilitate the reſidue; which, for matter of faith, was <hi>Indulgences,</hi> inuocation of Saints, and Purgatorie. And to this end they elected tenne Diuines, two Generals of Friars, and two for euery Prince, that is for the Pope, <hi>France,</hi> (of which there were but a few remaining) <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portugall;</hi> charging them to conſider how the Proteſtants opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this matter might briefly bee confuted. And themſelues beeing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, meant to propoſe their owne opinions in generall Congregation, by which the Canons might be compoſed, at the ſame time when Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſhould be handled, that they might quickly diſpatch thoſe matters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearing the diſputes of the Diuines, as formerly they had done.</p>
            <p>In matter of reformation they treated with the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> the Emperours and Spaniſh Ambaſſadours, to bee content that the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">The reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> of Princes might bee propoſed alſo: who ſaying it was fit that abuſes ſhould be remooued, whereſoeuer they were, the Articles were collected, and hope conceiued that all that remained might bee decided in one Seſſion onely. But the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour, for many reſpects of his King did not like that haſte, and therefore did croſſe it, with many difficulties. Firſt hee propoſed, that it was neceſſary, before the Councell ended, to vſe meanes to bring the Proteſtants thither, alleadging that it would be labour in vaine, if the Decrees were not accepted by them, and that there was no hope they would accept them, if they were not preſent in Councell. The Legats anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the Pope had done for his part whatſoeuer was fit, wrote letters, and ſent expreſſe <hi>Nuncij</hi> to them all, ſo that nothing could bee done to make their contumacie more manifeſt. The Count anſwered, that hee did not deſire it ſhould be done in the name of his Holineſſe, becauſe that would not onely not cauſe them to come, but make them more auerſe, but in the name of the Councell, with conuenient promiſes, and interceſſion of the Emperour. Whereunto the Legats replying, that they would conſider on it, they gaue an account thereof to the Pope, that he might uſe meanes in <hi>Spaine</hi> to diuert ſuch diſcourſes, and to perſwade the ending of the Councell. The Count deſired alſo that the Diuines might ſpeake publikely, according to the vſe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the particulars of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and of the other matters, perſwading the Prelats, that the order might not be changed, nor the reputation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell diminiſhed, by omitting the examination of thoſe things, which had more neede of it then any other.</p>

The Pope was much troubled with theſe aduiſes, and the rather, becauſe <hi>Don Lewis d' Auila,</hi> and <hi>Vargas,</hi> the Ambaſſador reſident with him, had giuen their words, that the King would be content that the Councell ſhould end. And calling them vnto him, he made a great complaint of the Counts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. For the Proteſtants, he ſaid that none did more deſire to reduce them to the Church then hee; that the actions of his predeceſſors for fourtie yeeres, and his owne, by ſending <hi>Nuncij</hi> expreſly to them all, not regarding the indignitie to which hee did ſubiect himſelfe and the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> was a manifeſt argument thereof; that he had vſed the Emperors mediation, and the perſwaſion of all Catholike Princes; that he is aſſured that the hardneſſe of their heart is voluntarie, reſolute, and obſtinate; and therefore that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of them was no more to be thought of, it beeing impoſſible, but the preſeruation of the obedient; that ſo long as there was any hope to regaine them, the time did require that all meanes ſhould be vſed to pleaſe them, but that beeing loſt, it was neceſſarie to keepe the good, to make the diuiſion ſtrong, and the parties irreconciliable, that the affaires of their King did require the ſame, as he would perceiue too late, in caſe he ſhould temporize in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and vſe termes of mediocritie, that the King ſhould remember what good effects his ſeuere executions, at his entrance into <hi>Spaine,</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced whereas if hee had proceeded remiſly, and deſired to gaine the fauour of the Proteſtants, hee would haue felt thoſe accidents which are ſeene in <hi>France.</hi> He complained alſo that the Count would preſcribe a manner of handling matters of Theologie, and determine when they ſhould be well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted. And laſt of all hee tolde them of their promiſe, that the King was content that the Councell ſhould end, which the Count did labour to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The Ambaſſadors hauing excuſed the Count, and confeſſed what they had ſaid concerning the Kings pleaſure for the end of the Councell, the Pope was ſatisfied, ſo that they would be content he ſhould ſay ſo much, where he thought it neceſſarie. Whereunto they conſenting, hee gaue order to his <hi>Nuncio</hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi> to complaine to the King, and to tell him, that he could not penetrate the cauſe, why the Ambaſſadours of his Maieſtie in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould ſpeake diuerſly, and, which imported more, himſelfe doing what he could to gratifie him, for what cauſe he ſhould be croſſed by his Miniſters, in regard, the Councel continuing, he was hindered from doing his Maieſtie many fauors and graces, that if for his affaires in <hi>Flanders,</hi> or for the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the Emperour in <hi>Germanie,</hi> he did deſire any thing of the Councel, he might know by experience how hard it was to effect it in <hi>Trent;</hi> that they might promiſe themſelues any thing from him, and that hee was reſolute, ſo ſoone as the Councel was ended, to ſend into all Prouinces to prouide for the particular neceſſitie of euery one, whereas in <hi>Trent</hi> generall prouiſions onely can bee made, which haue infinite difficulties, to bee fitted to euery place.</p>
            <p>But the perſwaſions of the Count in <hi>Trent</hi> made a diuiſion of the Prelates, ſome deſiring that thoſe matters might bee exactly diſputed; and the rather, becauſe very little or nothing was ſpoken of them by the Schoolemen, and whereas for other things handled in the Synode there were deciſions ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of other Councels, or of Popes, or an vniforme conſent of Doctors, theſe
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:17208:383"/>
were wholly obſcure, and, in caſe they were not cleered, it would bee ſayd that the Councel had failed in the moſt neceſſarie things.

Therefore in theſe, and the adoration of Saints the vſe only might be handled, and the reſidue omitted, and, for <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> the opinion of the heretikes condemned only; otherwiſe there would be no end of the Councel, nor any reſolution of this difficultie. While theſe opinions went about, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe matters reſerued for the laſt, the Legats reſolued to diſpatch that of Matrimonie, and to abbreuiate the time of the Seſſion, and to holde it the 19 of Auguſt at the lateſt.

            <p>The 22. of Iuly the <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> were giuen forth, not much differing from the manner, in which they were eſtabliſhed afterwards.

And the ſame day the Fathers were admoniſhed to put vp in writing to the deputies the abuſes obſerued by them, in the matter of Matrimonie.</p>
            <p>The voyces beeing all giuen concerning the <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were propoſed; the promotion of married perſons to holy <hi>Orders,</hi> and the making voyde of clandeſtine marriages. For the former, the Fathers <note place="margin">Two new Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Prieſts and ſecret mariages.</note> did vniformely, and without difficultie, agree on the negatiue; and the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Fiue Churches,</hi> who perſwaded them to thinke better on it, were ſcarcely heard. But the other of clandeſtine mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; did not paſſe ſo. For one hundred thirty and ſixe did approue the making it voyd, fiftie ſeuen did contradict, and ten would not declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. The Decree was compoſed according to the opinion of the <hi>Maior</hi> part, that howſoeuer clandeſtine mariages were good, ſo long as the Church did not make them voyde (and therefore the Synod doth anathematiſe him that thinketh the contrarie) yet the Church hath alwayes deteſted them. And now, ſeeing the inconueniences, the Synod doth determine, that all perſons which hereafter ſhall either marrie or betroth themſelues, without the preſence of three witneſſes at the leaſt, ſhall bee vnable to contract, and whatſoeuer they doe therein ſhall be voide. And another Decree followed, commanding the <hi>Banes,</hi> but concluding, that if there were a neceſſitie to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, the mariage might be made, ſo that it were in preſence of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Prieſt, and of fiue witneſſes at the leaſt, publiſhing the <hi>Banes</hi> afterwards, vpon paine of excommunication, to him that ſhould contract otherwiſe. But that great number which would make void the ſecret mariages, was diuided into two parts, ſome following the opinion of thoſe Diuines who grant power to the Church to make the perſons vncapable, and ſome, thoſe who ſay it may make the contract voide. And the Legates themſelues did differ. <hi>Morone</hi> was content with any reſolution, ſo that they might diſpatch. <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mienſe</hi> thought that the Church had no power herein, and that all mariages, celebrated in what manner ſoeuer, with conſent of the perſons contracting, are good. <hi>Simoneta</hi> ſaid, that the diſtinction of the contract of Matrimonie from matrimonie it ſelfe, and the giuing of power to the Church ouer the one, and not ouer the other, ſeemed to him ſophiſticall, and chimericall, and was much inclined not to make any innouation.</p>
            <p>Concerning the abuſes of Matrimonie, many Prelates conſidered that the cauſes to hinder mariages, and to make them voyde though they were contracted, were ſo many, and happened ſo often, that there were but few not ſubiect to ſome of thoſe defects; and (which was more) perſons did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ignorantly; either not knowing the prohibition, or the fact, or by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe, in whom, after they knew the trueth, many perturbations and ſcruples did ariſe, as alſo ſuits and contentions about the legitimation of the iſſue, and the dowries. The impediment of kinred, contracted in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, was particularly alleadged for a very great abuſe, becauſe in ſome places twenty or thirty men were inuited for God-fathers, and as many women for God-mothers, betweene all which, by Eccleſiaſticall conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a ſpirituall kinred doth ariſe, who oftentimes, not knowing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:17208:384"/>
do ioyne in marriage, Many thought fit to take away this impediment; not becauſe it was not well inſtituted at the firſt, but for that, the cauſe of the inſtitution beeing ceaſed, the effect ought to ceaſe alſo. They conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the goſſips were then ſureties to the Church, for the faith of the children baptized, and therefore were bound to inſtruct and chatechize them, according to their capacitie, by which meanes they conuerſed often, and familiarly with them and their parents as alſo the goſſips amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by which meanes a certaine relation did ariſe betweene them, which was a cauſe to be reuerenced and ſufficient to prohibite marriage, as all other cauſes to which reuerence ought to bee borne. But afterwards, when vſe bad aboliſhed whatſoeuer was reall herein, and the God-father did ſeldome ſee his God-childe and had no care at all of his education, the cauſe of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ceaſing, the relation ought not to haue place.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe the impediment of Affinitie by fornication, nullifying marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages vntill the fourth degree, it beeing a matter of ſecrecie, did enſnare many, who, vnderſtanding the trueth after the mariage, were filled with perturbations. For kinred of Conſanguinity, and Affinity, it was ſaid, that the ſame account beeing now not made of it, as formerly was, and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt great perſonages, ſcarce memorie kept of the fourth degree, that might bee omitted alſo. Wherein there was much diſputation. Some thought, that as ſeuen degrees of kinred did hinder marriage for many hundred yeeres, and <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third tooke away three of them at once, reſtrayning the impediment vnto the fourth, alleadging very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reaſons, that there are foure Elements, foure humours of mans body, ſo, it appearing now that foure cannot bee obſerued without many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, the impediments may bee more iuſtly reſtrayned to the third. Others contradicted, and ſayd, that ſo they might hereafter proceede fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at the laſt come to that of <hi>Leuiticus;</hi> which would cheriſh the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the Lutherans; and therefore did conclude that it was dangerous to innonate. Which opinion, after much examination, did preuaile. Some thought that the impediment of fornication, beeing ſecret, ought wholly to beetaken away: But they preuailed not, becauſe there appeared an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, in regard that many things which firſt are ſecret are publiſhed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p>Many were of opinion that no nouitie ſhould bee made in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, but power granted to Biſhops to diſpence, and maintained that it was better to giue it to them then to the court, becauſe they knowing, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the merits of the fact, and the cauſes, may exerciſe diſtributiue iuſtice more exactly herein. They ſayd, the court of <hi>Rome</hi> doth often giue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations to perſons not knowen, who obtaine them by deceipt, and that diligence cannot be vſed in regard of the diſtance of the Countreys. beſides the world beeing ſcandalized, thinking they are not giuen but for money, that imfamie ought to be taken away. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>French-men</hi> labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red effectually herein; but the <hi>Italians</hi> ſaid they did it to make themſelues all Popes, and not to acknowledge the Apoſtolique <hi>Sea,</hi> and that the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of ſending to <hi>Rome,</hi> and negotiating the expedition with paines and coſt was profitable, becauſe by that meanes, few marriages were contracted

in degrees prohibited; whereas, if by granting power to Biſhops there were a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>facility herein, the prohibitions would, in a ſhort time, come to nothing, and ſo the Lutheranes would gaine their opinion. Here upon a common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> grew, that none ſhould bee diſpenſed with, in theſe prohibitions, but for a very vrgent cauſe; into which opinion thoſe who could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile for the Biſhops did enter alſo, thinking it was more for their credit, if that which was forbid to them, were not granted to others. After many diſcourſes in the Congregations, it was reſolued to reſtraine ſpirituall kinred; and affinity by mariage and fornication, and to confine the diſpenſutions alſo with in the limits which ſhall be ſpoken of in reciting the Decrees.</p>
            <p>There was ſome contention alſo about the ninth poynt, in which Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours <note place="margin">Whether one may be forbid or forced to marry.</note> are forbidde to force their ſubiects to marry, with threats and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments naming the Emperour, and Kings. <hi>Gulielmus Caſſodorus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bacellona,</hi> oppoſed, and ſaide, that it could not bee preſuppoſed, that great Princes would meddle in mariages but for great cauſes, and for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good; that threats and puniſhments are then bad, when they are vſed contrary to order of law, but penall precepts, conformable to the law, are iuſt, and can not bee reprehended. If there be any caſe (he ſaid) in which the Superiour may iuſtly command a mariage, he may force the celebration of it, by penall commands, alleading alſo that it is a thing decided by the Diuines, that iuſt feare doth not cauſe an inuoluntary action. Hee deſired that lawfull cauſes might be excepted, and thoſe Superiours only compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Decree, who doe compell againſt iuſtice, and order of the law, ſaying, that many caſes may occurre, in which the neceſſity of the publique good doth require the celebration of a mariage, which hee that would ſay, that a prince could not command, and cauſe, by compulſion, to bee celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhould offend againſt the law of God, and man. To this reaſon he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an example, that, in the yeere 1556. the ſecond of Ianuary, <hi>Paul</hi> the 4. ſent a monitorie to Dame <hi>Ioan</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> wife of <hi>Aſcanius Columna,</hi> that ſhe ſhould not marry any of her daughters without his leaue, or, if ſhe did, the matrimony, though conſummated, ſhould be void; which that moſt wiſe and ſincere Pope would not haue done, if Princes had not power to marry their ſubiects, in caſe of the publique good.</p>
            <p>In the point of not mentioning Princes he was followed by many, and the name of the Emperour, Kings, and Princes, was taken away. But for the reſidue hee was much oppoſed, with this reaſon onely, that Matrimony is an holy thing, in which the Secular power hath no authority, and if there be any lawfull cauſe to compell any to marry, it muſt be done by the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall power onely. The relation of the monitory of <hi>Paul,</hi> raiſed a great wiſpering in the Congregation, and afterwards gaue matter of diuers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. Some ſayd he did it, not as Prince, but as Pope, and that he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doe it, in regard <hi>Aſcanius Columna</hi> being a traytor vnto him, he would not haue him get new adherences, by mariage of his daughters, by which hee might bee confirmed in his contumacie. Others ſaid, that the Pope, as Vicar of CHRIST, hath no traitors intemporall matters, and that the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe who thinke that mariages may be made void by Apoſtolique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is not well grounded, except it bee by courſe of law, or generall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:17208:385"/>
but not for particular perſons, and that, for this, neither reaſon can be brought, nor example found. Some denied, that one might ground himſelfe vpon ſuch actions of popes, which ſhew rather how farre the abuſe of their power can ſtretch, then how farre the lawfull vſe thereof is extended.</p>
            <p>And there was no leſſe difficulty, becauſe the Decree did comprehend fathers, mothers, and other domeſticall Superiours, who might compell their children, eſpecially daughters, to marry: and it was conſidered, that to come to excommunication, in caſes of this kind, was very hard. Yet thoſe who before had defended, that children were bound to obey their Fathers in this particular, did maintaine it. A temper was propoſed, that hauing firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded politique Superiours vpon paine of excommunication, domeſticall Superiours ſhould bee admoniſhed not to compell their children againſt their will. But the ſame men ſtill oppoſed, and ſaid, it was not iuſt to take from fathers that power which God hath giuen them. And, in the end, it was reſolued to take this part quite away. But the biſhop of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> and ſome few beſides, were not of the ſame opinion, as to ſay, that as the authority of fathers and other domeſticall Superiours ouer mariages was manifeſt, or, at the leaſt, not to bee doubted, and therefore not to bee ſpoken of, ſo the ſame conſideration ought to bee had of the authoritie of Politique Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</p>
            <p>The Congregations, aſſembled to diſcuſſe this point, beeing ended, the laſt whereof was the laſt of Iulie, they beganne to ſpeake priuately of ſecret mariage. And both parties continuing in their owne opinions, ſome ſaid that the difficulty doth preſuppoſe a doctrine of faith, and therefore cannot bee determined, beeing contradicted by a notable number. This troubled them much who deſired they ſhould bee made voide, and thought that they were wholly barred from all poſſibility to obtaine it.</p>
            <p>At this time a difficulty aroſe, though priuate, yet very contentious. <note place="margin">A difficulty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Archbiſhop of <hi>Toledo.</hi>
               </note> For the Deputies concerning the <hi>Index,</hi> hauing giuen the worke of <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus Caranza,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> to ſome Diuines, to bee peruſed, and they hauing related that nothing worthy of cenſure was found in it, the Congregation did approoue it, and made publique faith thereof at the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Agent. But becauſe the booke, and the authour were vnder the cenſure of the Inquiſition of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Secretary <hi>Caſtellunne</hi> complained to the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> and the Count to the Fathers of that Congregation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring a retractation. The fathers not inclining to reuoke the Decree, becauſe they thought it iuſt, the biſhop of <hi>Lerida,</hi> either mooued by the Count, or for ſome other cauſe, beganne to ſpeake againſt it, and to taxe it, alleadging places of the booke, which, by a bad interpretation, did ſeeme to deſerue cenſure, and, which was more, touched the iudgement and conſcience of thoſe Biſhops. The Arch biſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> the chiefe of that Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in defence of himſelfe and his colleagues, complained to the Legates, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring they would ſhew themſelues in the buſineſſe, and proteſting not to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in any publique act, vntill the Congregation had due ſatisfaction. The Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> interpoſed, and made peace, with theſe conditions, that no other copie of the faith made ſhould bee giuen, and that <hi>Lerida</hi> ſhould giue
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:17208:385"/>
ſatisfaction of words to the Congregation, and to <hi>Prague</hi> in particular, and that all ſhould bee forgotten on both ſides. And the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> with vnreſiſtable entreaties, got the teſtimonie out of the hands of the Agent of <hi>Toledo:</hi> and ſo this ſtirre was appeaſed.</p>
            <p>The Legates gaue the Articles of reformation to the Ambaſſadours, in number thirty eight, that they might commend to their conſideration what pleaſed them, before they were giuen to the Fathers to bee diſcuſſed; which <note place="margin">38. Articles of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Articles were diuided, and one halfe allotted for the next Seſſion, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Seſſion following, for the reaſons which ſhall bee related here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. The Count of <hi>Luna</hi> perſwaded the other Ambaſſadours, to demaund, that deputies might be elected for euery Nation, to conſider what was fit to be reformed, becauſe the modell giuen by the Legates, made for the intereſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> could not be fitted to other countreys. But the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Portugall</hi> Ambaſſadours contradicted, alleadging that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one might ſpeake his opinion concerning the Articles propoſed, and propoſe others, if there were cauſe, ſo that there was no need to giue this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſt to the Pope, and the Legates, who could not endure to heare ſpeach of Nations in Councell. And the Imperialiſts comming to this opinion alſo, the Count retired, but ſaid that diuers conſiderations ought to bee had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe which were propoſed.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> counſelled the Legats to facilitate the buſineſſe, and to take away thoſe points which might ſeeme to cauſe contradiction, adding, that the fewer matters were handled, the better it would be; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armienſe</hi> ſeeming to wonder, <hi>Loraine</hi> asked him, whether hee marueiled <note place="margin">The Card of <hi>Loraine</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth the change of his minde.</note> becauſe hee ſaw not in him that heate and deſire of reformation, as hee had made demonſtration of at other times: and he added, that his deſire was the ſame, and had the ſame diſpoſition of minde to imploy all his force therein, but that experience hath taught him, that not onely nothing perfect or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie can bee done in Councell, but that euery enterpriſe in that buſineſſe turneth to the worſt. He perſwaded alſo the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> not to ſeeke to hinder the reformation totally, but if there were any thing which did not fully ſatisfie him, hee ſhould make the partcular knowen, and hee would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that contentment ſhould be giuen him.</p>
            <p>The Emperours Ambaſſadours firſt of all gaue their anſwere in writing, the one and thirtieth of Iuly; in which they ſaid, that, deſiring a generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in the head and members, and hauing read the Articles exhibited, they had added ſome things, and noted others, deſiring they might be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted accordingly, and diſcuſſed by the Fathers. And becauſe the Emperour, with the Ambaſſadours of many Princes, did hold a Diet in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna,</hi> to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle many things concerning the Councell, they hoped they would take it in good part, if, hauing receiued a new commandement from his Maieſtie, they ſhould preſent other conſiderations alſo; and that, for the preſent, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded eight Articles to thoſe propoſed by them. 1 That a ſerious, and <note place="margin">The Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts adde 8.

That <hi>Commendaes,</hi> and <hi>Coadiutories,</hi> with future ſucceſſion, might bee taken away.

4. That Schooles and Vniuerſities might be reformed. 5.

That <hi>Conſeruators</hi> may not bee giuen in prophane matters.</p>
            <p>And, concerning the Articles exhibited by the Legates, they noted many things, part whereof, as being but of ſmall weight, it will not be amiſſe to omit. Thoſe of importance were. That Cardinals might bee choſen out of all Nations, that the Vniuerſall Biſhop might bee created by Electors of all Countreys. That the prouiſions againſt <hi>Penſions, Reſeruations</hi> and <hi>Regreſſes,</hi> ſhould bee extended, not onely to the future, but to thoſe alſo that are paſt. That the kiſſing of the Goſpel ſhould not be taken from the Emperour and Kings, who ought to defend it. That it may be declared what ſecular affaires are prohibited to Eccleſiaſtiques, that that which is determined in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reſidence may not be croſſed. That, in the Article of not laying taxes vpon the Eccleſiaſtiques, the cauſe of Subſidie againſt the <hi>Turkes</hi> and other Infidels may be excepted, The propoſition, though it were of hard dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, did not ſo much trouble the Legats, as the doubt mooued, that ſome extraordinary demaund for change of <hi>Rites,</hi> receiued by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and relaxation of Precepts <hi>de iure Poſitiuo,</hi> might come from the Diet in <hi>

That Biſhoprickes may not bee giuen them, that they may the better aſſiſt the Pope, and, that their dignitie being equall, their reuenew may bee equall alſo. That none may haue more then one Benefice, and that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, vnknowen to the good ages of the world, of Benefices ſimple, and with cure, compatible, and incompatible, may be taken away, and that hee that hath two at this preſent, may chooſe and keepe one only, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſhort time. That reſignations in fauour may be quite taken away. That it may not bee prohibited to conferre Benefices onely vpon thoſe who haue not the language of the Countrey, becauſe the Lawes of <hi>France</hi> forbid all ſtrangers, without exception, to haue Offices, or Benefices in the Kingdome. That the criminall cauſes of Biſhops may not be iudged out of the kingdome, in regard of the ancient priuiledge of <hi>France,</hi> that none may bee iudged out of the Kingdome, neither voluntarily, nor by compulſion.

That the prohibition, that the Clergie may not meddle in ſecular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, may be expounded, ſo that they may abſtaine from all functions, which are not holy, Eccleſiaſticall, and proper to their order. That the <hi>Penſions,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie impoſed, may be taken away and abrogated. That, in cauſes of Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, the ancient inſtitution in <hi>France</hi> may not be changed, to giue ſentence in the <hi>poſſeſsorie,</hi> for him who is in the laſt poſſeſſion, and in the <hi>petitorie,</hi> for him who hath a lawfull title, or a long poſſeſſion. That the lawes of <hi>France</hi> concerning Eccleſiaſticall cauſes may not bee preiudiced, that the <hi>poſſeſſorie</hi> may beiudged by the Kings Iudges, and the <hi>petitorie</hi> by the Eccleſiaſtiques, but not out of the Kingdome. That none may be aſſumed to bee Canon in a Cathedrall Church, before he be fiue and thirtie yeeres old. That, for the Article containing the reformation of Princes, the Clergie may bee firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely reformed in this Seſſion, and that which belongeth to the dignity and authoritie of Kings and Princes, may bee deferred vntill the next, and that nothing may be decreed therein, before they the Ambaſſadours bee heard, who haue giuen account to the King of thoſe and other things, which they had to propoſe. But howſoeuer they propoſed theſe difficult matters, yet they ſaid indifferently to all, and with affectation, that it might be publiſhed, that they would not be earneſt in any thing, but that which concerneth the rights and Secular affaires of their Kingdome. The Venetian Ambaſſadours propoſed, that the Article of Patronage might be ſo accommodated, that it might not giue occaſion of nouitie, concerning thoſe who belong to their <hi>Republique,</hi> and Prince. The Ambaſſadours alſo of <hi>Sauoy</hi> and <hi>Tuſcane</hi> made the ſame inſtances.</p>
            <p>At this time the Imperialiſts receiued commiſſion from their Prince, to mediate, as they did, with the Legats, that, in the reuiew of the <hi>Index</hi> of the bookes, mention might not bee made of the <hi>Receſſes,</hi> of the Diets in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> formerly prohibited by <hi>Paul</hi> 4: and the Emperors order was ſomewhat ſharpe, that, in ſtead of handling of Eccleſiaſticall matters, they would not giue a forme to the policie of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and occaſion to the people who are gouerned by ſuch Lawes, to aliene themſelues from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wills. Anſwere was made, that the Biſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> one of them, who was chiefe of the Congregation, might know whether any ſpeech were made of it, and if there was not, his Maieſtie might truſt to his Ambaſſadour, who, in all cauſes concerning him, ſhould bee fauoured both by them, and by the Pope.</p>
            <p>The ſeuenth day the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour preſented his writing; in which hee ſaid he was well ſatisfied with all the Articles, and would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing, but onely the change of ſome words, which ſeemed vnto him to be ſuperfluous, or that they may be expounded better. And hee tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched almoſt all things which did enlarge the authoritie of Biſhops, ſo mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the words, that the alteration did not ſeeme to be ſubſtantiall, but that indeed he did rather reſtraine then augment it. Hee made requeſt alſo that they would treat of the <hi>Conclaue,</hi> ſaying, that the King did much deſire it; as alſo that the part concerning fecular Princes might be deferred vntill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seſſion. After he had exhibited his writing, hee deſired the Legates,
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:17208:387"/>
that, ſo ſoone as voices were giuen concerning the things propoſed, they would depute Fathers of euery Nation, to collect what they ſhould thinke neceſſary for reformation of their Countreys, that all might bee determined with a generall ſatisfaction. <hi>Morone</hi> anſwered in the name of all, that they could not conſent to proceede otherwiſe then they had done hitherto in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters. Wherein many things being ſaid by both parties, by the Count to intimate the Councell was in ſeruitude, and by the Cardinall to ſhew the libertie, <hi>Morone</hi> added, that no man could complaine that hee was hindered in his libertie of ſpeaking. The other replyed, that he could not beleeue that any thing of worth had beene done by them, and did not forbeare to tell him, that there was a great murmuring in the Councell for the particular congregations aſſembled a few dayes ſince, and that it was ſuppoſed that they were made to get voices. The Legates ſaid, it was their duety, in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of opinions, to vnderſtand the trueth, and to accommodate the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, that matters may bee determined with vnion. The Count replyed, that it was well if it were ſo, but that <hi>Italians</hi> onely were called, except two or three Spaniards, and as many Frenchmen, who differed from others of their Nations. The Legats defended themſelues, that they were not called in proportion, becauſe there were an hundred and fiftie Italians in Councell, and not aboue threeſcore of all other Nations. The Count ſeemed to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and, being parted, ſaid to his Prelats, that the Legats hauing begun a diſcourſe to ſhew that eſteeme ought not to bee held of Nations, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it, ſhewing that they had euer held eſteeme of them.</p>
            <p>The next day, the Legats and two Cardinals conſulted about the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſments of the Ambaſſadours, and how to amend the Articles of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be giuen to the Fathers and of the maner to bee held in ſpeaking on them. In which <hi>Loraine</hi> hauing receiued new letters from <hi>France,</hi> and order, that both himſelfe, and all the other French Prelats ſhould fauour the Popes affaires, wholly bent to ſatisfie the Legats, perſwaded them not to ſuffer ſo many points to be handled at once, but to diuide them into parts, according to the ſubiects, and when one part was ended, to propoſe another, and to haſten the Seſſion, omitting all the things which had any difficultie, and concluding thoſe onely, in which all, or the greateſt part would agree, and particularly not to propoſe, in the beginning, thoſe in which the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours did not conſent.</p>
            <p>The eleuenth day the Congregations began to be celebrated, to eſtabliſh the <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> and decrees of Matrimonie. The propoſition of the French-men was handled, to make mariages voide, contracted by children, without conſent of parents, in whoſe power they are. And the firſt that gaue voice, did differ in opinion. The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> did approue it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging places of the Scripture which giue to the Fathers power to marry their children, examples of mariages of the Patriarkes <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Imperiall lawes of the <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> and the <hi>Code,</hi> made by Chriſtian Princes of famous memorie; as alſo the Canon vnder the name of <hi>Euariſtus,</hi> and another of the Councell of <hi>Carthage,</hi> produced by <hi>Gratian.</hi> And hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the inconueniences ariſing herein. The Arcbiſhop of <hi>Otranto</hi> was of the contrary opinion; ſaying, that this was to giue authority to Lay-men ouer
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:17208:387"/>
the Sacraments, and make them beleeue that the authoritie in making them voide, doeth depend on the paternall, not on the Eccleſiaſticall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Beſides, it would be a decree directly contrary to the holy Scripture, which expreſſely faith that a man ſhall leaue father and mother, and cleaue to his wife. And, for inconueniences, it will cauſe more, referring the ſonnes to their fathers in matters of conſcience. And if a father would not conſent to the mariage of a ſonne, who hath not the gift of continencie, hee would be infinitely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed. Nine and twentie ſpake in that Congregation, and twentie were of opinion to omit that matter. Of the others, ſome approoued the decree ſo generally, and ſome reſtrained it in ſonnes to the age of twentie yeeres, and of eighteene in daughters.</p>
            <p>In the end of the Congregation, the Venetian Ambaſſadours cauſed a <note place="margin">The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite a petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning diuorces in the Greeke Church.</note> demaund of theirs to bee read, concerning the <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> of diuorces; which did continue in ſubſtance. That their Republique hauing the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Cyprus, Candie, Corfue, Zante,</hi> and <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> inhabited by <hi>Grecians,</hi> who haue from all antiquitie vſed to put away their wiues for fornication, &amp; take another, for which <hi>Rite,</hi> well knowen to the whole Church, they were neuer condemned, nor reprehended by any Councell, it was not iuſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne them in abſence, hauing not been called to this Councell. Therefore that the Fathers would bee pleaſed ſo to accommodate the Canons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this matter, that they may not doe them any preiudice. The Legates hauing receiued this demaund, did cauſe it to bee propoſed, without making any particular examination of it; which cauſed a whiſpering amongſt the Fathers. And in the next Congregation, ſome of them touched that ſtring, repeating the ſame, that it was not iuſt to condemne the <hi>Grecians,</hi> not heard, nor cited, The Archbiſhop of <hi>Prague</hi> oppoſed, and ſaid, that, by the generall citation of all Chriſtians, they alſo were vnderſtood to be cited by the Pope, To which the Cardinall of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armia</hi> added, that his Holineſſe had ſent particularly to inuite the Duke of <hi>Muſcouia:</hi> and howſoeuer he knew not wel that hee had inuited other of the Greeke Church in ſpeciall, yet it ought to bee preſuppoſed that the whole nation was called, euen by ſpeciall inuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beſides, the generall intimation was ſufficient, as the Archbiſhop had ſaid. Whereupon the Legates gaue order to the Secretarie, to take that particular out of the petition of thoſe Ambaſſadours, that is, that the <hi>Grecians</hi> haue not beene called. But as well in regard of their propoſition, as of the opinion of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> they would not vſe the word <hi>Anathema,</hi> but found a temper, that is, not to condemne thoſe that ſay that Matrimony may bee diſſolued for adulterie, and another contracted, as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and ſome <hi>Greeke</hi> Fathers did ſay, and as the Eaſterne Church doeth practiſe, but to anathematize thoſe who ſay, the Church may erre, teaching that the Matrimoniall bond is not broken by adultery, and that it is not lawfull to contract another, as the Lutherans doe maintaine. This forme was generally approued, &amp; many did praiſe it, and ſay, that the Councel was aſſembled only to condemne the opinions of the Proteſtants, and not thoſe of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Yet ſome doubted how one could bee condemned for ſaying the Church did erre in teaching an article, the contrary whereof was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. But ſeeing that it was fauoured by ſo many, they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="756" facs="tcp:17208:388"/>
And becauſe the propoſition about the mariage of children did bring in a generall queſtion, whether the Church could make mariages void, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ſpeake of it, howſoeuer it had beene ſpoken of before, the voices collected and the Decree compoſed accordingly, as hath been ſaid. Cardinall <hi>Madruccio</hi> maintained the negatiue, and alleadged many reaſons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſaying, that he would oppoſe in Seſſion alſo. And <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armienſe,</hi> and <hi>Simoneta,</hi> ſpake as much. But <hi>Laynez,</hi> Generall of the <hi>Ieſuites,</hi> hauing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed a writing againſt the irritation, made a greater confuſion, and gaue occaſion to many to be more conſtant and courageous in the other opinion. And in the Congregations they beganne to anſwere one anothers reaſons, with ſuch prolixity, that the Legats were almoſt of opinion to omit that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for feare it would hinder the Seſſion, and the rather, becauſe the Biſhop of <hi>Sulmona</hi> did firſt make a queſtion in publique Congregation, whether that matter of irritation did belong to doctrine, or reformation. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Segouia,</hi> who ſpake after him, made a long diſcourſe, to ſhew, that it could not be reduced to doctrine, and therefore the maior part hauing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued the irritation, the Decree was as good as eſtabliſhed. The Biſhop of <hi>Modena</hi> followed the ſame opinion, adding, that to handle that matter by way of doctrine, would take away all meanes of making any reformation whatſoeuer. For in all Articles the ſame difficultie might be moued, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church hath authoritie in that particular which is handled: which would bee as much as to put Armes into the hands of heretikes, and to take all authoritie from the Church, becauſe it would not bee fit to meddle with that, to which it might be doubted whether their authoritie did extend. He complianed, that that queſtion was moued by him, who ought to hold it, as cleare and decided. This opinion pleaſed many, who ſayd that it neuer ought to bee diſputed whether the Church can doe any thing or not, but to take it for granted, that as all power in heauen and earth is giuen to CHRIST, ſo the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icar,</hi> hath as much, which being communicated by him to the generall Councel, it muſt be defended that it wanteth no power to doe whatſoeuer is profitable, without diſputing whether it concerne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or not. It pleaſed thoſe alſo who deſired the diſpatch of the Councel, perceiuing that the difficultie promoted might hinder the ending thereof, and cauſe a ſcandall. And the Legates and principall Italians vſed perſwaſions that it might not bee ſpoken of, in regard there was no cauſe to treat of it with the French men or the Spaniards, who did all agree in opinion, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret mariages ought to bee made voide. And many aſſemblies of Prelates were made both amongſt themſelues, and with the Legates, to this end: and it was reſolued that the decree ſhould not onely not bee placed with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that it might not ſeeme to be a part of it, but alſo that it ſhould not bee ſo much as in a Chapter apart, leſt it might bee doubted whether it was held to be ſuch, or not, but that it ſhould bee inferted amongſt the articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. And to remooue all difficultie the more, it was reſolued alſo ſo to compoſe the decree, that they might not ſeeme to handle that matter pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely, but to mingle it with the firſt article of the abuſes, which was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion to reſtore the <hi>Banes,</hi> ordained by <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, which had been intermitted, and in decreeing as well this, as all the other conditions appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:17208:388"/>
for the publike forme of Matrimonie, it ſhould bee added, in two wordes onely, as it were incidently, that all contracts made otherwiſe were void, and ſo paſſe it ouer, and ſay no more. And the Decree was compoſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this ſence, and reformed often, alwayes very intricately, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had euer more difficulty then the former. And amongſt other alterations, this point, eſtabliſhed before, as hath been ſaid, was changed, that the preſence of three witneſſes was ſufficient for abſolute validity, and, in ſtead of one wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, it was ſubſtituted, that euery Matrimonie ſhould be void, contracted without the preſence of the Prieſt; a thing which did much exalt the Clergie, ſeeing that ſo principall an action, in Politicall and Economicall adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which vntill then had beene onely in the hands of thoſe to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, came to be in the power of the Eccleſiaſticall order, there remayning no meanes to contract Matrimonie, if two Prieſts, that is the Pariſh Prieſt, and the Biſhop intereſted for ſome reſpects, ſhall refuſe to afford their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. I haue not found in the memorials who was Author of this great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage; as many other particulars of importance are hid from mee alſo, whereof I would willingly make mention. I ought not to defraud <hi>Francis Beaupere,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Metz,</hi> of his due honour, who, thinking it impoſſible to reduce this Decree into ſuch a forme as might giue ſatisfaction to various opinions, and to repreſent them with reſeruations and nice diſtinctions, gaue this forme to it, in which it now is; which as it is ſubiect to diuers interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſo it may bee fitted to diuers opinions: and being propoſed in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, it had one hundred thirty and three voyces in fauour of it, and nine and fifty did expreſly contradict.</p>
            <p>The Legates informed the Pope of all, and demanded order what they ſhould doe, and whether the contradiction of ſuch a number, it beeing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to perſwade them, ſhould hinder the Decree, or not. There was a <note place="margin">A vaine feare of the plague in <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> report, which cauſed ſome feare amongſt the Fathers, that the plague was in <hi>Iſpruc,</hi> and many would haue been gone, if the Cardinal <hi>Morone,</hi> who thought that matters were in good terme to finiſh the Councel, had not vſed meanes to know the certaintie; which was, that in <hi>Sborri,</hi> a place twentie miles diſtant from <hi>Iſpruc,</hi> many of thoſe poore men who laboured in the mines, died of a contagious ſickneſſe, by an infection taken vnder the ground, and that thoſe of <hi>Ispruc</hi> had prouided ſo well, as that there was no danger the diſeaſe would come thither, which alſo did decreaſe in <hi>Sborri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great ſtirre happened likewiſe amongſt the Italian Prelates, eſpecially thoſe of the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and Dukedome of <hi>Milan.</hi> For the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <note place="margin">A ſtirre about the <hi>Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in <hi>Milan.</hi>
               </note> King moued the Pope, the moneth before, to place the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> in the ſtate of <hi>Milan,</hi> as it is in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to make a Spaniſh Prelate the Head of it, alleadging, that in regard of the vicinity of places infected, it was neceſſary to vſe exquiſite diligence for the ſeruice of God, and defence of religion: and notice came that the Pope had propoſed it in conſiſtory &amp; did ſhew (howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it was contradicted by ſome Cardinals) ſome inclination to it, at the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Cardinall <hi>Carpi,</hi> who told him, that it was good for the keeping of the citie of <hi>Milan</hi> in deuotion towards the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> which office hee performed, for a ſecret hope, cheriſhed by the Spaniſh Ambaſſador, that, by this meanes, hee ſhould gaine the fauour of the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to make him
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:17208:389"/>
Pope. The cities of that ſtate ſent <hi>Sforza Morone</hi> to his Holineſſe, and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare Tauerna,</hi> and <hi>Princiſuale Biſoſto</hi> to the Catholike King, and <hi>Sforza Briuio</hi> to the Councell. This laſt to pray the Prelates, and Cardinals of that ſtate, to haue compaſſion on their Countrey, which being brought into miſery, by exceſſiue impoſitions, would bee wholly diſſolued by this, which goeth beyond all, many citizens preparing themſelues to abandon the Countrey, knowing well that that office had neuer proceeded in <hi>Spaine</hi> to heale the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but very often to emptie the purſe, and for many other mundane reſpects alſo. And if the <hi>Inquiſitors,</hi> vnder the Kings owne eyes doe domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neere ſo rigidly ouer their owne Countrey men, how much more will they doe it in <hi>Milan,</hi> where remedy will hardly bee found againſt them, towards perſons whom they care leſſe for. <hi>Briuio</hi> declared how the Cities were generally perplexed with this ill newes, deſiring the fauour of the Prelates. This did more diſpleaſe the Prelates, then the Seculars, and thoſe of the Kingdome did doubt, that, the yoke being put vpon the ſtate of <hi>Milan,</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſhould not bee able to keepe it from their owne neckes, as they had done before. The Prelates of <hi>Lombardie</hi> did aſſemble, and reſolue to write letters to the Pope, and to Cardinall <hi>Borromeo,</hi> ſubſcribed by them all. They tolde the Cardinall it would bee a preiudice to him, to whom it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, as Arch-biſhop, to bee the chiefe in that office. And they ſaid to the Pope, that there were not ſuch cauſes and reſpects as are in <hi>Spaine,</hi> to put ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gorous an Inquiſition amongſt them; which, beſides the euident ruine which it will bring to that ſtate, will be a great preiudice to the holy <hi>Sea.</hi> For he could not refuſe to place it in <hi>Naples</hi> alſo; which would giue occaſion to other Princes of <hi>Italie</hi> to deſire the like. And that <hi>Inquiſition</hi> hauing authority<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Prelates, the holy <hi>Sea</hi> would haue but little obedience from them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would be forced to ſeeke the fauor of ſecular Princes, to whom by this meanes they would be ſubiect; ſo that, in occaſion of a new Councel, he ſhould haue but few Prelates whom hee might truſt, and commaund freely. Neither ought hee to beleeue that which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might ſay, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> ſhould bee ſubiect to that of <hi>Rome;</hi> as doeth appeare by their proceeding in the cauſe of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> euer refuſing to ſend the Proceſſes which haue beene demanded from <hi>Rome:</hi> as alſo doe the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> of the Kingdome of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> who depend on <hi>Spaine.</hi> The Prelates, not content with this and other reaſons alleadged vnto the Cardinals, and others of <hi>Rome,</hi> by euery one to thoſe with whom hee had any power, did perſwade alſo that ſome word might bee inſerted in the Decrees of the Councel, in fauour of the Biſhops, to exempt or ſecure them, and that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of making proceſſes in that matter might be decreed, which if it could not be done in the firſt Seſſion, it might in the next. <hi>Morone</hi> gaue them hope of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. And this accident did trouble the Councell very much, becauſe many were intereſted in it. But newes came, a few dayes after, that the Duke of <hi>Seſſa</hi> had found the generall diſtaſte it gaue, and, for ſome reports which came vnto him, doubting that the Dutchie of <hi>Milan</hi> would follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Flemings, who became <hi>Gueux</hi> (for ſo the reformiſts are called in thoſe Countreys) by the attempt of putting the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> vpon them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was not a fit time to handle that buſineſſe, ſtopped their Ambaſſadors,

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee wrote concerning this to his <hi>Nuncij</hi> in <hi>Germanie, France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and ſpake of it to all the Ambaſſadours reſiding with him, and to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Princes of <hi>Italie</hi> alſo, vſing this concept, <hi>that to him that aſsiſted to finiſh the Councell, hee ſhould bee more obliged, then if hee had aſsiſted him with armes, in ſome great neceſsitie.</hi> To the Legates hee anſwered that they ſhould principally ayme at the concluſion of the Councell, and ſhould grant what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was neceſſary to obtaine it, admitting as few preiudiciall things as was poſſible: all which hee did referre to their wiſedome who were in the buſineſſe, ſo that the Councell might end with ſpeede.</p>
            <p>But the Legates, hauing together with ſome of the Prelates, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the propoſitions of the Ambaſſadours concerning the reformation, and, <note place="margin">And ſo doe the Legats.</note> at their inſtance, omitted ſixe of the Articles propoſed, and reduced them to the number of two and thirtie, the one and twentieth of Auguſt gaue them to the Prelates to bee diſcuſſed. <hi>Loraine</hi> made particular congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the French-men to examine them: which did pleaſe the Legates, not onely becauſe they were aſſured hee had the ſame intention as they had, but becauſe they were deſirous to accommodate them to the common ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before they were ſpoken of in generall Congregation. And they gaue order to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Otranto,</hi> and <hi>Taranto,</hi> and to the Biſhop of <hi>Parma,</hi> to aſſemble their adherents in their priuate houſes, to examine them, and ſearch what would giue a generall contentment.

But as they were about to giue them foorth, ſo corrected, the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> vpon an inſtruction newly brought vnto him by a Currier from the Emperour, did inſtantly deſire the Legats, not to propoſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Secular Princes, vntill they had anſwere from his Imperiall Maieſtie, and afterwards was ſeconded by the Count of <hi>Luna.</hi> The Legates were much perplexed herewith, conſidering that <hi>France</hi> firſt, and now the Emperour, and King of <hi>Spaine</hi> were not ſatisfied. And, on the other ſide, the common deſire of all the Fathers was, that the reformation ſhould bee made all together. Whereupon being aſſembled in the houſe of <hi>Nauaggero,</hi> who was ſicke, they propoſed, whether all the reformation ſhould be put off, <note place="margin">The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Princes, and ſome Articles of the other Reformation are differed.</note> or onely that part which concerneth Princes. <hi>Loraine</hi> was of opinion that onely this ſhould be deferred, and the reſidue propoſed, which would haue pleaſed, but that they doubted they ſhould make the Prelates afraid, that the ſecular reformation ſhould bee wholly omitted, whereby they might take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to exclaime both priuately, and in the publique Congregations. Whereupon they reſolued to ſatisfie the Ambaſſadours, deferring the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Princes; and, that the Prelates might not take it ill, to deferre halfe at the leaſt of the other Articles, and thoſe the moſt important, giuing foorth the reſt, as they had corrected them, that the voyces might bee giuen, and the Seſſion celebrated, though the difficultie about the Decree of clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine marriages did make them doubt. The ſixt of September one and twenty Articles of reformation were giuen foorth, with order to beginne the congregations on the morrow. In the compoſition of theſe, Cardinall <hi>Simoneta,</hi> and his adherents, vſed all their Arte and ingenie, to proceede with ſuch a temper, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> might not bee preiudiced, and the world which deſired reformation, and the Ambaſſadours who did ſolicite it, ſatisfied, and, which was of moſt importance, the Biſhops contented. For beeing deſirous to finiſh the Councell, it was neceſſary that they ſhould willingly concurre.</p>
            <p>The BB. had all one ayme, to haue the gouernment more free: which they thought they ſhould obtaine, if three prouiſions were made. One, that Pariſh Prieſts ſhould depend on them; which would happen, if the collation of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices with cure were giuen vnto them, which point, beſides other diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, did touch <hi>Reſeruations,</hi> and the rules of the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> which was to diſcouer a great part of the ſecrets of the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> For it did plainely appeare, that a gate would bee opened to take all collations from them, which was as much as to take from them all power, and life it ſelfe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to a temper, to hold the <hi>Reſeruations</hi> firme, but to make the Biſhops. Patrons to giue the Cure to whom they pleaſe, vpon pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination. And, to this end the 18. Article was framed, with exquiſite artifice, as euery one may ſee; which, with a faire ſhew, giueth power to the Biſhop to beſtow the Benefice on whom he pleaſeth, and yet taketh no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite from the Court. Another point was of exemptions, wherein they had formerly receiued many ſatisfactions, and now the 11. Article was added for a totall complement. The exemptions of the regular Orders remained; and the Biſhops were in hope, either to take them quite away, or, at the leaſt, ſo to moderate them, that they ſhould be ſubiect vnto them, in a great part.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="761" facs="tcp:17208:390"/>
Euer ſince the beginning of the yeere, there was a congregation erected about the reformation of the regulars, which, by the aſsiſtance of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and aduice of other religious perſons in Councell, had made a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, and eſtabliſhed good decrees, without contradiction; for outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in ſhew the Regulars did not onely not abhorre, but deſire them; but ſecretly they made account to interpret and practiſe them as they liſted: yea they thought it good to haue a ſtrict reformation in writing; as indeede all <note place="margin">The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Regulars.</note> their rules are one thing as they are written, and another as they are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But when they beganne to ſpeake of moderating their exemptions, and ſubiecting them, at leaſt in part, to the Biſhops, the Generals, and the Diuines of the Orders did mutiny all together; and treating with the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of Princes, they ſhewed them what ſeruice they did to people, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and publique Gouernements, offering, that if any abuſe whatſoeuer were amongſt them, it ſhould be amended; that they would bee contented, with any reformation, and returning to their gouernements, would execute it with more ſeuerity then it was ordayned; but to ſubiect the Monaſteries to the <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> was abſolutely to put them out of order. For they, not vnderſtanding a regular life, nor the ſeuerity of diſcipline wherewith it is maintained, would diſorder euery thing. The Biſhops ſayd, that a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is euer with detriment and derogation of the Law, and the reuocation fauourable, reducing things to their owne nature; and therefore to take them away was not to innouate, but to reſtore things to their ancient ſtate. On the other ſide it was anſwered, that the exemption of the Regulars was ſo well preſcribed by antiquity, that it could no more bee called a priuiledge, but common-law; that when the Monaſteries were ſubiect to Biſhops, the Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline both in them and their Canons, was ſo well gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſo ſeuere, that it merited to ſuperintend ouer all; that if they will reſtore antiquity, they muſt doe it in all parts, that if Biſhops would returne to bee as they were in thoſe times, Monaſteries might bee ſubiected to them now, as then they were, but it was not iuſt that they ſhould demand the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency ouer Monaſteries, before they made themſelues to be ſuch as was neceſſary the Rectors of a regular life ſhould bee. The Regulars were fauoured by the Ambaſſadours, and by the Legates, for the intereſts of the Court, which would haue loſt a great inſtrument, if they had not depended wholly on it. And they wanted not the fauour of ſome Prelates, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed their reaſons were good. This contention continued certaine dayes, but did abate by little and little, becauſe the Biſhops who had mooued it, did diſcouer euery day more difficulty in it.</p>
            <p>The third Article was concerning the impediments which Biſhops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from ſecular Magiſtrates, who, to preſerue the temporall power, doe not ſuffer them to exerciſe that abſolute dominion which they would, not only ouer the Cleargy, but ouer the people. To this effect, the reformation of Princes was made, whereof wee haue ſpoken already, and will hereafter, more at large. This part, and others which cohere with it, were deferred vntill another Seſſion, becauſe it was thought a difficult matter, and that it would haue much prolonged the buſineſſe. But the Biſhops did expound this delay as if they had meant to haue done nothing in it. And they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
<pb n="762" facs="tcp:17208:391"/>
that, purpoſing to reforme the whole Church, the Cleargie onely ſhould be reformed. The Legates vſed all meanes to appeaſe them; ſhewing; that not this only was deferred, but other matters alſo, which were neceſſary to be handled, promiſing that the delay was only to proceed with more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie, and that they ſhould certainely bee diſcuſſed; that it was neceſſary to facilitate the diſpatch of that Seſſion, which ſhould be a preparatorie for the other, in which all that remaineth ſhould be handled. The Legats were all bent to hold the Seſsion at the time appointed, thinking it neceſſary for the quicke diſpatch of the Councell: for which the Pope, by euery ordinary Currier, and ſometimes by an extraordinary, did ſollicite them, that he might be ſet at liberty from it. In the Congregation of the ſeuenth of September Friar <hi>Martinus Roias,</hi> Ambaſſador for the <hi>Hoſpitalaries</hi> of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> now called Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> was receiued; which was deferred by reaſon of the great oppoſition of ſome principall Biſhops, that hee might not haue <note place="margin">The Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</note> place aboue them, ſaying it was not iuſt that a religion of Friars ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the whole body of ſo many Prelats. But, finally, the matter was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and publiſhed in Congregation, that place was giuen him amongſt the Ambaſſadours, without preiudice of the Prelates, who pretend precedence. The Ambaſſador made an Oration, and excuſed their grand <hi>Maſter,</hi> who did not ſend to <hi>Trent</hi> ſooner, by reaſon of the rumors of the <hi>Turkiſh Armada,</hi> and <note place="margin">His Oration.</note> of the incommodities they receiued by <hi>Dragut,</hi> the Pyrate. He exhorted the Fathers to remedie the preſent euils, which alſo did not a little touch the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars of their religion, who are not idle members of the Chriſtian Common-wealth. He perſwaded the extirpation of hereſies, offering that their grand <hi>Maſter,</hi> and Societie, would take vpon them the patronage and defence of the cauſe, ſpending not their goods onely, but their life and blood. Hee related the beginning of their religion, which was fourtie yeeres before <hi>Godfrey</hi> did goe to the conqueſt of the holy land; the heroicall workes done by their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſters, the like whereof they could not performe now, becauſe they were ſpoiled of a great part of their lands, and poſſeſſions; that they are a <hi>Barracado</hi> of <hi>Sicilie</hi> and <hi>Italie</hi> aginſt the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Therefore hee prayed the Fathers to take notice of the antiquitie, nobilitie, merits, and dangers of that <hi>Societie,</hi> and to cauſe their poſſeſſions, and <hi>Commendaes,</hi> vſurped from them, to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and that it might be decreed by the Councel, that they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vpon none but of their order, ratifying the immunities and priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges thereof. The <hi>Speaker</hi> receiued the excuſe in the name of the Synod, and promiſed that they would haue that conſideration, as his demand, for the preſeruation of the <hi>Commendaes</hi> and priuiledges of that religion, did deſerue. But howſoeuer hee made the ſame inſtance afterwards to the Legates, and the relation to the Pope, his Holineſſe would neuer anſwere any thing, but that it belonged to him onely to make prouiſion herein, and that hee would doe it, in time conuenient.</p>
            <p>In that Congregation and thoſe that followed, voyces were giuen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the 21 Articles of reformation, propoſed; in which though there was nothing of great moment, yet for the order of the ſtorie, and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many things which happened afterwards, it is not amiſſe to make mention of the principall. In the firſt, which was of the election of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:17208:391"/>
it being ſaid that there was an obligation to prouide the moſt worthy, the difficultie formerly mooued did returne, that it would binde very ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the hands, as of the Pope in collations, ſo of kings and Princes in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, if they were tyed to nominate one perſon onely. And the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part was of opinion to remooue the comparatiue, and to ſay onely, that they were bound to prouide a worthy perſon. But on the other ſide, ſome conſidered that the Fathers haue alwayes vſed this maner of ſpeech, that <note place="margin">In the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

There was much diſputation herein; but, a meanes was found to compoſe all, leauing, in ſhew, the word, <hi>more worthy,</hi> and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king firſt in poſitiue termes, and paſſing afterwards to comparatiues, that the prouiſion might bee vnderſtood to be free; and ſo that forme was vſed which is now in Print: that is, that there is an obligation to prouide good and fit Paſtours, and that he doth mortally ſinne who doth not preferre the more worthy, and more profitable to the Church; leauing a naturall expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to theſe words, that many are more worthy and more profitable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of others, who are leſſe; in which compaſſe the will of him that is to prouide hath a large field.</p>
            <p>In the third Article there was ſome difficulty about the viſitation of Arch-biſhops. Theſe alleadged the Canons, and ancient cuſtomes, that the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragans did ſweare obedience to the Metropolitans, and were wholly ſubiect to their viſitation, correction, and gouernement, and would not conſent that their authoritie ſhould be preiudiced, and, amongſt theſe, the Patriarke of <hi>Venice</hi> was exceeding warme. On the contrary, the Biſhops, eſpecially thoſe of the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> laboured to mainetaine the cuſtome, by which they differ not in authority, but in name onely. But the number of the Biſhops being great, and of the Arch-biſhops ſmall, and the Legates and Papalins fauouring thoſe, that theſe might not, by granting authoritie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by their ſubiection, exempt themſelues more from ſubiection to the Court, they would obtaine nothing, but one word onely of ſatisfaction; that is, that they were not forbid to viſit, when there was cauſe, approoued by the Prouinciall Councell. Whereof the Arch-biſhops did complaine, and ſay, it was iuſt nothing. For there beeing one Arch-biſhop in the Prouinciall Councel, and many Biſhops, it is certaine that the cauſe would neuer bee approoued.</p>
            <p>The ſixt Article was concerning the exemption of Chapters of Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals, from Epiſcopall authoritie; in which the Spaniſh Biſhops, and, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of them, the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> hauing great intereſt, many reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; ampliations were made, but not ſuch as did content the Prelats how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they were often changed, and in the end deferred vntill another Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as ſhall be ſaid,</p>
            <p>The thirteenth Article, concerning <hi>Penſions,</hi> ſpake generally that no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice ſhould be burthened with greater <hi>Penſions</hi> then of the third part of the fruits, or of their value, conformeable to that which was vſed when the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> began. This ſeem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> conuenient to the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> becauſe there are ſome very rich benefices which could not be ſaid to be burthened,
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:17208:392"/>
if they ſhould pay two thirds, and others ſo poore, that they cannot beare any <hi>penſion</hi> at all. And therefore he ſaid, that this was not a iuſt diſtribution, and that it was better to prohibite, that Biſhopriques of a thouſand crownes and benefices of an hundred, ſhould be burthened, and concerning the others, to ſay nothing. This opinion preuailed to the great content of the Legates, and Papalins, for the abſolute power which was left to the Pope in good Benefices, Thoſe who demaunded a moderation of the <hi>penſions</hi> of <hi>reſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of fruits formerly impoſed of <hi>acceſſes</hi> and <hi>regreſſes,</hi> made many and long diſcourſes. But the difficultie compelled euery one to bury all in ſilence, for the confuſion and diſorders which were foreſeene would enſue For all would haue excuſed themſelnes that they would not reſigne their Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices without thoſe conditions, and thoſe eſpecially who had payd compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the <hi>Chamber</hi> for the obtaining of ſuch <hi>graces,</hi> would haue complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the <hi>graces</hi> ſhould bee taken from them, and the money not reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; the reſtitution wereof was a thing impoſſible. Finally euery one thought it enough to prouide for the future, without thinking of that which is paſt.</p>
            <p>The fourteenth Article, which did deteſt and forbid all payment of part of the fruits for the collation, prouiſion or poſſeſſion, did much pleaſe the <hi>French men.</hi> They ſaide the payment of <hi>Annats</hi> was taken away by thoſe words. And indeed he that doth conſider, and examine them, cannot giue them any other ſence, howſoeuer the euent hath ſhewed, that they haue not been ſo vnderſtood in <hi>Rome.</hi> In the ſeuenteenth, in which <hi>pluralitie</hi> of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices is forbid, and <hi>dualtie</hi> granted when one is not ſufficient, ſome deſired an addition, that they ſhould not be diſtant aboue a dayes iourney, that the incumbent might make part of his reſidence in each of them. But they could not obtaine it, neither did they much labour, foreſeeing that that addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as alſo the whole Article, would not bee executed but againſt thoſe of the poorer ſort onely. The eighteenth, howſoeuer it did pleaſe in that it did reſtore in effect the prouiſion of Benefices with cure to Biſhops; yet the French-men did oppoſe againſt the forme of the examination, becauſe it did ſeeme to binde the Biſhops hands to ſtrait. Their reaſon was, that, by that concourſe, too open and to publike a way was giuen to ambition; that antiquitie made profeſſion to giue benefices to him that refuſed them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, by this new manner they would not only procure them but profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be worthy of them.</p>
            <p>In the nineteenth, the Biſhop of <hi>Conimbria</hi> ſpake at large againſt the <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatiues</hi> or <hi>Aduowſons,</hi> becauſe they did make the incumbents death to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and ſometimes procured. And for <hi>mentall Reſeruations,</hi> hee ſayd they were fraudes, and neere thefts, and that it was better to leaue to the Pope the whole collation of all Benefices, then to vſe ſuch vnworthy Artifices, as was to giue vertue to a ſecret thought, not publiſhed, and to leaue a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion that it was not a reſeruation in the minde, but an inuention after the fact. But <hi>Simoneta</hi> croſſed his diſcourſe, ſaying, that it was good to reprehend abuſes for which no prouiſion was determined, that it might be procured, but ſeeing a common diſpoſition to the remedie, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree compoſed alreadie, it was ſufficient to eſtabliſh it, by conſenting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:17208:392"/>
multiplying words of reprehenſion, ambitiouſly, when there was no neede.</p>
            <p>The eleuenth of September, the French Ambaſſadours receiued letters from the King, of the eight and twentieth of Auguſt; in which hee ſignified, that hee had receiued the Articles, imparted to them by the Legates, and did ſee that matters were farre from the hope hee conceiued, becauſe to eſtabliſh theſe was to pare the Kings nayles, and to make thoſe of the Eccleſiaſtiques <note place="margin">The French King writeth to <hi>Trent,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Reformation of Princes.</note> longer. Which becauſe hee would not endure, hee commanded to repreſent to the Fathers with wiſedome, dexteritie, and courage, that as euery Prince, ſo long as the Councell doth proceed aright, is bound to fauour it with all heate of zeale, ſo to couer the ſore, which cauſeth the preſent euils, and to make a greater, with the preiudice of Kings, is farre from that which was expected. That he ſaw how lightly they paſſed ouer the reformation of the Clergy, who onely haue giuen the ſcandals to thoſe that haue ſeparated themſelues from the Romiſh Church, and how they aſſume authoritie to take away the rights and prerogatiues of Kings, to breake their Conſtitutions and Cuſtomes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by time out of minde, to anathematize and excommunicate Kings and Princes, all tending to ſowe diſobedience, ſedition, and rebellion of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects againſt their Soueraignes; whereas it is manifeſt to the whole world, that the power of the Fathers, and of the Councel, extendeth onely to the reformation of the Clergie, without touching matters of State, or of Secular power and iuriſdiction, which is wholly diſtinct from the Eccleſiaſticall, and that alwayes, when the Fathers and Councels haue preſumed to handle ſuch things, Kings and Princes haue made reſiſtance; whence many ſeditions and warres, to the great damage of Chriſtendome, haue proceeded. That they ſhould exhort them to bee carefull in that which belonged to their charge, and was neceſſarie for the preſent occaſions, and to leaue thoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, which, hauing neuer done good heretofore, would produce a worſe effect in thoſe times. The King added, that, if the Fathers would not retire vpon theſe perſwaſions, they, the Ambaſſadours, ſhould make a ſtrong oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; which being done, without expecting their iudgement, or referring themſelues to their diſcretion, they ſhould depart, and goe to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> letting the French Prelats know that they ought to continue in Councel, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to doe God ſeruice, being aſſured, that, in caſe any thing ſhall be treated againſt the rights, prerogatiues and priuiledges of the King and French Church, they will not faile to abſent themſelues, as his Maieſtie would haue them doe. He wrote alſo to the Cardinal of <hi>Loraine</hi> in the ſame manner, as he gaue order ſhould be told the other Prelates; that is, that hee ſhould not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue any thing with his preſence, that ſhould be handled in Councel againſt the Kings rights, but ſhould abſent himſelfe, if he ſhall ſee that the Fathers do ſally without the limits of their charge, referring him, for the reſidue, to the inſtructions ſent to the Ambaſſadours.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadours hauing receiued theſe letters, and conſulted of all with the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> by his aduice, did impart them to the Legats, and cauſed a voyce thereof to paſſe in the Councel, that the Biſhops, hearing of it, might deſiſt from demanding the reformation of Princes, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues might not haue occaſion to oppoſe, and proteſt. But this brought
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:17208:393"/>
foorth a contrarie effect. For the Biſhops who were quiet, in regard of the expectation that, when the Seſſion was ended, the reformation of Princes ſhould be propoſed, vnderſtanding this newes, and perceiuing that the ayme was to paſſe it ouer in ſilence, began to treat among themſelues, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any further in the actes of the councell, if that alſo which concerneth Princes were not giuen forth; and put in conſultation, together with the other articles. And they proceeded ſo farre herein, that a hundred of them gaue <note place="margin">A combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Prelates concerning the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> their word one to another to bee conſtant in this reſolution; and hauing drawen a writing to this purpoſe, which was ſubſcribed by all, they went to the Legats, requiring that the articles of the Reformation of Princes might be propoſed and giuen to the Fathers, declaring, as it were by way of proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they would not proceed, nor conclude any thing in the others, but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with theſe. The Legates gaue good words, purpoſing, and hoping to diuert the humor. And, in this trouble, the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> appeared againe, and demanded, as he had done before, a reuocation of the Decree, <hi>propenenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Legatis,</hi> that euery Prelate might propoſe what he thought worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: and demanded alſo that the ſixt Article might bee amended, to pleaſe the Spaniſh Prelates, taking quite away the exemptions of the <hi>Chapters</hi> of the Canons of Cathedrall Churches, and ſubiecting them to the Biſhop. And there being in <hi>Trenta</hi> Proctor of thoſe <hi>Chapters,</hi> who laboured to the contrary, he commanded him to ſpeake no more in it.</p>
            <p>Things ſtanding in theſe termes, the Legates thought to hold the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the matter of matrimony onely. But it was oppoſed, that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of Clandeſtine marriage were not well digeſted as yet, and that the Ambaſſadours would ſuſpect, that if the Seſſion were held, and the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not ſpoken of, all hope was loſt that it would euer bee handled. And it being euident that no part of the reformation could bee in order, at the time determined for the Seſſion, they propoſed, in the generall Congregation of the fifteenth of the moneth, to prolong it vntill the eleuenth of Nouember; and ſo it was reſolued. The cauſe of this long delay was, that the Pope, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difficulties to finiſh the Councell, ariſing partly by the controuerſies of the Prelates, and partly by the oppoſitions of the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour, put all hope of ouercomming them in the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine.</hi> Whereupon <note place="margin">The Popes confidence is onely in the Cardinal of <hi>Loraine.</hi>
               </note> hee wrote to the Legates, that, in caſe the Seſſion could not bee held at the time appointed, it ſhould be deferred for two moneths. And this hee did that the Cardinall might haue time to come vnto him, that hee might treat with him, of that which was impoſſible to doe by letters or meſſengers, and that, by this meanes, euery preuious diſpoſition for the concluſion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell might bee prepared. Vntill that time the Pope had no other determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then to finiſh the Synode, but hee firmely reſolued then, that, if that <note place="margin">The Pope is reſolued by all meanes to be freed from the Councel.</note> could not be done, there being a neceſſitie to rid himſelfe of it, hee would by all meanes diſſolue it. Hee ſent the Legates facultie to make a ſuſpenſion, or a tranſlation, as they thought beſt, by aduice of the Fathers, and wrote vnto them that hee would, by all meanes, be freed from it, by an end of it, if it were poſſible, which hee did much deſire, but, if it could not be, they ſhould vſe one of thoſe two remedies: and therefore that they ſhould endeuour to make ſome occaſion ariſe, that they might bee requeſted to doe it, that hee might

not ſeeme to bee the author; as alſo that they ſhould ſollicite the iourney of <hi>Loraine;</hi> who parted the next day after the reſolution was made to prolong the Seſſion.</p>
            <p>All the diſtaſtes of <hi>France</hi> for matter of the Councel were ceaſed in the Pope, though he receiued continuall troubles from that kingdome. He was much vexed with the dayly inſtance, made vnto him, that he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the alienation of 100000. crownes of Eccleſiaſticall goods, and by the <note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> goeth to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> continuall detraction which he vnderſtood the Hugonots vſed againſt him, and the Apoſtolique <hi>Sea.</hi> And particularly, hee was grieued at the Cardinall <hi>Chaſtillion,</hi> who, as hath beene ſayd, layd aſide the clericall habite, and called himſelfe Count of <hi>Beauvois,</hi> and, vnderſtanding that the Pope in Conſiſtory had depriued him of the Cap; the laſt of May, hee reſumed the habite of a <note place="margin">The Cardinal <hi>Chaſtillion</hi> mocketh the Pope.</note> Cardinall, and was married in it: and in a great ſolemnitie in <hi>Roan,</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of Auguſt, when the King was declared in Parliament to bee of age, he appeared in the ſolemnitie, in the ſame habite, in preſence of all the <hi>French</hi> Nobilitie; which was generally thought to bee a great contempt of the Papal dignitie. Wherewith the Pope beeing mooued, hee made his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation <note place="margin">And is depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him.</note> to bee printed at this time, and many copies to bee diſperſed in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> reſident in <hi>France,</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> a few dayes before the arriuall of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine;</hi> who was diſpatched by the Queene, to propoſe to the Pope a conference betweene his Holineſſe, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the King of <hi>Spaine;</hi> and the King her ſonne, in whoſe traine her ſelfe would be. The propoſition did not diſpleaſe the Pope, becauſe it might ſerue him to finiſh the Councell, but hee thought the execution was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And he promiſed to ſend <hi>Nuncij</hi> to the Emperour and King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to this end; and appointed the Biſhop of <hi>Vintimiglia</hi> for <hi>Spaine,</hi> whom hee therefore recalled from <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Iſchia</hi> for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
            <p>To the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> he made exceſſiue demonſtrations of honor, lodged him in the palace, (a thing vnuſuall) went publiquely to viſite <note place="margin">How the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> was treated in <hi>Rome</hi>
               </note> him in his lodging. Their diſcourſes were partly about the Conference, though the Cardinall did not thinke it feaſable. They treated about the ſale of a 100000. crownes which whether the Cardinall did promote or draw backe, was not diſcouered. But the Pope hauing, vpon a new inſtance made by the French Ambaſſadour, anſwered, that he did referre it to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, many thought it to be an excuſe inuented by <hi>Loraine.</hi> But the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall buſineſſe was about finiſhing the Synode, which the Pope thought to be of greateſt importance, and knew to bee moſt difficult. Wherein there was great confidence betweene them. For the Cardinall diſcouered to him that his intereſts were turned the ſame way, and that, ſince the death of his brothers, he ſaw plainely, that there was no meanes to maintaine Religion in <hi>France,</hi> and his houſe, but his coniunction with the Apoſtolique <hi>Sea.</hi> The Pope promiſed to make Cardinals at his inſtance, and gaue him ſuch words as ſhewed an intention to make him his Succeſſour in the Popedome: and that they might haue more credite, he made ſhew, that the greatneſſe of that Cardinall was profitable for the endes hee had, in ayming at ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:17208:394"/>
of great moment. And the concluſion of his diſcourſes to euery one was; <hi>We muſt ſhut vp the Councell, prouide money, and afterwards that will happen which ſhall pleaſe</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>The Pope told the Cardinall, that as often as he heard of the diſcords, and delaies, which ſome did plot, he thought to ſuſpend the Councell; but chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his opinion, for feare of the ſcandall which the world would take, which knew not the trueth: and that ſometimes he thought this the greateſt euill that could occurre, and ſometimes iudged it leſſe then the danger in which his authoritie was, which was the marke at which the Princes, Biſhops, and all ſorts of perſons did ſhoot: but finally, that it was neceſſary to lay aſide all reſpects, and come to this reſolution. The Cardinall diſſwaded him, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this was not a medicine to cure the euill, but to deferre it onely, with greater danger, becauſe hee would, in a ſhort time, haue new demands to reſtore it, and plots would be laid by thoſe who were not ſatisfied with him; and that to ſuſpend was as difficult as to finiſh it, For there was no need to alleadge cauſes for this, it being ſufficient to bring things to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and ſo to ende, whereas the ſuſpenſion did require an allegation of the cauſe, whereof euery one would ſpeake his opinion; that it was more honourable to finiſh, then to ſuſpend it; and hee vſed other reaſons, which made the Pope know that his counſell was good and faithfull. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he aduiſed him to deale plainely with the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore calling the Ambaſſadours of that King, hee complained, in grieuous termes, ſaying, that he had called the Councell, vpon hope and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that the affaires of the Papacy would haue beene fauoured by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, to whom he had giuen all imaginable ſatisfaction, and would giue him more, according to his demands, if the impediments, cauſed by the Councel, were taken away; that he had not demanded any fauour of his Maieſtie and his Miniſters, but the ending of the Councell, for the ſeruice of GOD, and the publike good, and therein was ill vſed, though it was rather a loſſe to the King, then a benefit. Therefore hee was forced to hold eſteeme of him by whom he was eſteemed, and to caſt himſelfe into the armes of thoſe that would asſiſt him. And he diſpatched alſo a Currier to the King, with a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his owne hand, complaining of the offices, done by his Ambaſſadour and Prelats in <hi>Trent,</hi> contrarie to his Miniſters in <hi>Rome,</hi> each party ſaying, hee doth the commiſſion of his Maieſtie. Hee ſhewed that it was conuenient for the ſeruice of GOD, of the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> and of his Maieſtie, that the Councell ſhould end; and in concluſion, he deſired him to declare himſelfe plainely whether he would aſſiſt him heerein, or not. The Cardinall did counſel him alſo not to be auerſe from granting to the Emperour the Cup, and marriage of Prieſts, by which meanes he ſhould gaine both him and the king of the <hi>Romans,</hi> not to conſent onely to the ending of the Councell, but to be fauourable, and to promote it. He told him likewiſe, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to omit the reformation of Princes, becauſe it would prolong the buſineſſe more then any thing beſides.</p>
            <p>After the departure of <hi>Loraine,</hi> nine French Biſhops parted from <hi>Trent,</hi> and returned home, ſo that there remained but eight, beſides ſixe who went with the Cardinall to <hi>Rome.</hi> This departure cauſed an opinion, that they
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:17208:394"/>
were recalled, and that there was a purpoſe, at the perſwaſion of the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> to recall the others, that, the end of the Councell approaching, no French men might bee preſent when they ſhould bee anathematized. The Legates, to facilitate the difficulties of ſecret mariage, cauſed the Diuines who were maintainers and oppoſers of it, to make a publike diſputation. This was neuer done before in any occurrence, and then did ſo little good, that euery one was more confirmed in his owne opinion. After this, to reaſſume the Congregations, and to handle the reformation, they gaue foorth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the Articles, the laſt of which was the reformation of Princes, being forced thereunto by the mutinie of the Prelats.</p>
            <p>Of which matter concerning Princes hauing often made mention, and now being come to a place, in which it is neceſſarie to recite it, for the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the things that follow, it muſt bee knowne that it did containe a propheme, with thirteene Articles, and a very pregnant Epilogue; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof was. That the Synode, beſides the things conſtituted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Eccleſiaſticall perſons, hath thought fit to correct the abuſes of the Seculars, brought in againſt the immunitie of the Church, hoping that the Princes will be content, and cauſe due obedience to be rendred to the Clergie. And therefore it doth admoniſh them to cauſe their magiſtrates, officers, and temporall Lords, to yeeld that obedience to the Pope and conſtitutions of the Councell, which themſelues are bound to performe. And, for facilitation heereof, it doth renew ſome things decreed by the holy Canons, and Imperial <note place="margin">The Articles of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Princes.</note> lawes, in fauour of Eccleſiaſticall immunitie, which ought to bee obſerued vpon paine of <hi>Anathema.</hi> 1. That Eccleſiaſticall perſons may not bee iudged in a ſecular Court, howſoeuer there may bee doubt of the title of the Clerkeſhip, or themſelues conſent, or haue renounced the things obtained, or for any cauſe whatſoeuer, though vnder pretence of publike vtilitie, or ſeruice of the King, nor ſhall be proceeded againſt there, in cauſe of murder, if it bee not truly and properly a murder, and notoriouſly knowne, nor in other caſes permitted by the law, without the declaration of the law going before. 2. That in cauſes ſpirituall, of matrimonie, hereſie, patronage, beneficiall, ciuill, criminall, and mixt, belonging, in what manner ſoeuer, to the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Court, as well ouer perſons, as ouer goodes, tithes, fourths, and other portions appertaining to the Church, or ouer beneficiall Patrimonies, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Fees, temporall iurisdiction of Churches, the temporall Iudges ſhall not meddle, neither in the <hi>Petitorie</hi> nor in the <hi>Poſſeſſorie,</hi> taking away all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale vpon pretence of iuſtice denied, or as from an abuſe, or becauſe the things obtained are renounced: and thoſe who ſhall haue recourſe to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular magiſtrate, in the cauſes aforeſaid, ſhall bee excommunicated, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their rights, belonging vnto them in theſe things. And this ſhall be obſerued alſo in cauſes depending in what inſtance ſoeuer. 3. That the Seculars ſhall not appoint Iudges in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, though they haue Apoſtolike authoritie, or a cuſtome time out of mind: and the Clerkes who ſhall receiue ſuch offices from the Lakes, though by vertue of any priuiledge whatſoeuer, ſhall bee ſuſpended from their orders depriued of their Benefices, and offices, and made vncapeable of them. 4. That the Secular ſhall not command the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge, not to excommunicate without licence,
<pb n="770" facs="tcp:17208:395"/>
or to reuoke or ſuſpend the Excommunication denounced, nor forbid him to examine, cite and condemne, or to haue Sergeants, or Miniſters for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. 5. That neither the Emperour, Kings, nor any Prince whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, ſhall make Edicts or Conſtitutions, in what manner ſoeuer, concerning Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, or perſons, nor meddle with their perſons, cauſes, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, or tribunals, no not in the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> but ſhall bee bound to affoord the ſeculat Arme to Eccleſiaſticall Iudges. 6. That the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall iuriſdiction of the Eccleſiaſtikes, though with meere and mixt power, ſhall not bee diſturbed, nor their ſubiects drawne to the Secular tribunals, in cauſes temporall. 7. That no prince or magiſtrate ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe by <hi>Briefe,</hi> or other writing, or giue hope to any to haue a Benefice within their dominions, nor procure it from the Prelates, or Chapters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, and hee that ſhall obtaine it by that meanes, ſhall bee depriued, and yncapeable. 8. That they ſhall not meddle with the fruites of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices Vacant, vnder pretence of cuſtodie or patronage, or protection, or of withſtanding diſcords, nor ſhall place there either Bayliefes, or Vicars: and the Seculars who ſhall accept ſuch offices, and cuſtodies, ſhall bee excommunicated, and the Clerkes ſuſpended from their Orders, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of their Benefices. 9. That the Eccleſiaſtikes ſhall not bee forced to pay taxes, gabels, eithes, paſſages, ſubſidies, though in the name of gift or loane, either in reſpect of the Church goods, and of their Patrimonial, except in Prouinces, where by ancient cuſtome, the Eccleſiaſtikes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues doe aſſiſt in publike Parliaments, to impoſe Subſidies both vpon the Laitie and the Clergie, to make warre againſt the infidels, or for other vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent neceſſities. 10. That they ſhall not meddle with Eccleſiaſticall goods, mooueable or immooueable, vaſſallages, tenths or other rights, nor in the goods of communities or priuate men, ouer which the Church hath any right: nor ſhall rent out the depaſturing or herbage which groweth in the lands and poſſeſſions of the Church. 11, That the letters, ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and citations of Iudges Eccleſiaſticall, eſpecially of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo ſoone as they bee exhibited, ſhall bee intimated, without exception, publiſhed, and executed, neither ſhall it bee neceſſarie to require con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or licence, which is called <hi>Exequatur,</hi> or <hi>Placet,</hi> or by any other name either for this, or for taking poſſeſſion of Benefices, though vpon pretence of withſtanding falſhoods, and violences, except in fortreſſes and thoſe Benefices in which Princes are acknowledged by reaſon of the temporalitie, and in caſe there ſhall bee doubt of falſitie, or of ſome great ſcandall or tumult, the Biſhop, as the Popes delegate ſhall conſtitute what hee thinketh needefull. 12. That Princes and Magiſtrates ſhall not lodge their officers, ſeruants, ſouldiers, horſes or dogs, in the houſes or Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Eccleſiaſtikes, nor take any thing from them for their foode or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. 13. And if any Kingdome, Prouince, or place ſhall pretend not to be bound to any of the things aforeſaid, by vertue of priuiledges from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike <hi>Sea</hi> which are in actuall vſe, the priuiledges ſhall bee exhibited to the Pope, within a yeere after the end of the Councell, which ſhall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by him, according to the merites of the Kingdomes or Prouinces, and, in caſe they be not exhibited before the end of the yeere, they ſhall be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:17208:395"/>
to bee of no force. And, for the Epilogue there was an ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Prindes to haue in veneration the things which concerne the Clergie, as peculiar to God, and not to ſuffer them to bee offended by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, renewing all the conſtitutions of Popes and holy Canons, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of Eccleſiaſticall immunitie, commanding vnder paine of <hi>Anathema,</hi> that neither directly nor indirectly; vnder any pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And this is it which was firſt imparted to the Ambaſſadours, and by each of them, ſent to their Princes, whereupon the French King gaue the order to his Ambaſſadors before mentioned, And the Emperor hauing ſeene them wrot to the Cardinall <hi>Morone,</hi> that hee could not poſſibly aſſent, either as Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, <note place="margin">Are diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Emperour.</note> or as Arch-Duke, that they ſhould ſpeake in Councell of reforming the iuriſdiction of Princes, nor to take from them authority to receiue aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and contributions from the Clergie, putting him in minde, that all the former euils did ariſe from the oppreſſions attempted by the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtikes againſt people and Princes. That they ſhould beware not to prouoke them more, and cauſe greater inconueniences to ariſe.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Loraine</hi> was departed, the French Ambaſſadours put their proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in order, to make vſe of it if need were. In the Congregation of the two and twentieth of September one of the Fathers made a long ſpeach to ſhew. that the cauſe of all deformation proceeded from Princes; that they had more neede of reformation; that the Articles were already in order, and was now time to propoſe them, that they might not vaniſh to nothing by delaies. After hee had ſpoken, the Ambaſſadour <hi>de Ferrieres</hi> made a long querulous <note place="margin">The ſpeach of <hi>de Ferrieres.</hi>
               </note> Oration, or, as the Frenchmen ſay, a complaint. The contents where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the principall points, were. That they might ſay to the Fathers as the Ambaſſadours of the Iewes did to the Prieſts. Ought wee alſo to continue faſting &amp; lamenting: That there are more then 150. yeres part ſince the moſt Chriſtian Kings haue demanded of the Popes a reformation of the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall diſcipline; that for this end only they haue ſent Ambaſſadors to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, of <hi>Conſtance, Baſil,</hi> and the <hi>Lateran,</hi> to the firſt of <hi>Trent,</hi> &amp; finally to this ſecond. What their demands were, <hi>Iohn Gerſon,</hi> Ambaſſadour in that of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> the Orations of <hi>Petrus Daneſius,</hi> Ambaſſadour in the firſt of <hi>Trent,</hi> of <hi>Guido Faber,</hi> and of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> in this ſecond, doe teſtifie: in which nothing was demanded but the reformation of the manners of the miniſters of the Church; and notwithſtanding this they muſt ſtill faſt and lament, not ſeuentie yeeres, but two hundred, and GOD grant they be not three hundred, and many more. And if any ſhould ſay, that ſatisfaction hath beene giueth them, by Decrees and <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> they did not thinke that this was to ſatisfie, to giue one thing in payment for another. If it ſhall bee ſaid that they ought to bee ſatisfied with a great bundle of reformations propoſed the moneth before, they had ſpoken their opinion concerning that, and ſent it to the King, who had anſwered, that he ſaw few things in it befitting the ancient diſcipline, but many things contrary. That that is not the plaſter of <hi>Iſaias,</hi> to heale the wound, but of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> to make it raw,
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:17208:396"/>
though healed before. That theſe additions of excommunicating and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematizing Princes, was without example in the ancient Church, and did make a way to rebellion; and all the Articles concerning the reformation of Kings and Princes, haue no ayme but to take away the libertie of the French Church, and offend the Maieſtie of the moſt Chriſtian Kings, who, by the example of <hi>Conſtantine, Iuſtinian,</hi> and other. Emperours haue made many Eccleſiaſticall lawes, which haue not onely not diſpleaſed the Popes, but they haue inſerted ſome of them in their Decrees, and iudged <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the ninth, principall authors of them, worthy of the name of Saints. He added, taht the Biſhops had, with them, gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Church of <hi>France,</hi> not only ſince the times of the <hi>Pragmatique,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordate,</hi> but foure hundred yeeres and more before the booke of the <hi>Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals;</hi> and that theſe lawes haue beene defended and renewed by the later Kings, ſince that the <hi>Decretals,</hi> ſubſtituted in place of them, haue deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from them in the times following. That the King, beeing now of age, would reduce thoſe lawes, and the libertie of the French Church into obſeruation, becauſe there is nothing in them contrarie to the doctrine of the Catholique Church, to the ancient Decrees of Popes, nor to the Councels of the Church vniuerſall. Hee ſaid moreouer that thoſe lawes doe not prohibite Biſhops to reſide all the yeere, and to preach euery day, not onely nine moneths, and in the feaſts, as was decreed in the laſt Seſſion; nor forbid them to liue in ſobrietie and pietie, and hauing the vſe onely, and not the benefit of the reuenues, to diſtribute them, or rather to render them to the poore, who are owners of them. And hee proceeded in naming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of the Councel, with the like ironicall manner, that hee ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ieſt at them. Hee added, that the power giuen by GOD to the King, the lawes of <hi>France,</hi> and the libertie of the French Church, haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes forbid <hi>Penſions, Reſignations</hi> in fauour or with <hi>Regreſſe, pluralitie</hi> of Benefices, <hi>Annats, Preuentions,</hi> and to litigate for the <hi>Poſſeſſorie</hi> before any but the Kings Iudges, or for the propriety, or other cauſe, ciuill or criminall, out of <hi>France,</hi> and forbid alſo the hindering of appeales, as from abuſe, or to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the King, Founder and Patron of almoſt all the Churches of <hi>France,</hi> may not make vſe of the goods and reuenues, though Eccleſiaſticall, of his Subiects, for inſtant and vrgent neceſſitie of the Common-wealth. Hee ſaid afterwards, that the King marueiled at two things. One, that they, the Fathers, adorned with ſo great Eccleſiaſticall power in the miniſterie of GOD, aſſembled onely to reſtore Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, not regarding this, ſhould binde themſelues to reforme thoſe whom they ought to obey, though they were ſtiffenecked. Another, that they ſhould think they can and ought, without any admonition, excommunicate and anathematiſe Kings and Princes, which are giuen by GOD to men, which ought not to bee done to any ordinary man, though perſeuering in a moſt grieuous offence. He ſaid, that <hi>Michael,</hi> the <hi>Archangel,</hi> durſt not curſe the Deuill, or <hi>Micheas,</hi> or <hi>Daniel,</hi> the moſt wicked Kings, and yet they, the Fathers, were wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant in maledictions againſt Kings and Princes, and againſt the moſt Chriſtian, if hee will defend the lawes of his anceſtors, and the liberty of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church. His concluſion was, that the King did deſire them not to
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:17208:396"/>
decree any thing againſt thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The Oration, when it was pronounced, did anger very much, not onely the Papalins, but the other Prelates more, and French-men alſo: <note place="margin">Is cenſured.</note> and, when it was ended, there was ſuch a whiſpering, that it was neceſſary to finiſh the Congregation. Some did taxe it of hereſie; and others ſaid, it was much to bee ſuſpected, at the leaſt; and others, that it was offenſiue to godly eares. They ſaid, hee had taken occaſion to doe it, in abſence of the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> who would neuer haue endured thoſe termes, and that his end was to diſſolue the Councell, that hee did attribute to Kings more then belongeth to them; that hee inferred that the Popes authority is not neceſſary for the vſing of Church goods; that hee made the French King like to the Queene of <hi>England.</hi> But nothing did ſo much offend, as that hee ſaid that the authority of the French Kings ouer perſons and goods Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, was not founded vpon the <hi>Pragmatique, Concordates,</hi> and priuiledges giuen by Popes, but vpon the law of Nature, holy Scripture, ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and lawes of the Chriſtian Emperours.</p>
            <p>The French Ambaſſadours were reprehended alſo, becauſe they did not follow the ſteps of the Emperours and Spaniſh Ambaſſadors, who, though they had the ſame intereſts, made not ſuch a commotion, becauſe they knew there was no reaſon for it. <hi>De Ferrieres</hi> defended himſelfe, &amp; ſaid, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates had promiſed the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> that this matter ſhould not bee ſpoken of, but with ſuch moderation, as that it ſhould not touch the affaires of <hi>France,</hi> which was not performed; that the Kings inſtruction had beene,

The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Sant,</hi> and the Abbat of <hi>Claraual</hi> were diſtaſted moſt of all, who went vp and downe, ſaying, that the Ambaſſadours had done ill to proteſt, and that their end was to make a confuſion, and giue occaſion for a Nationall Councel in <hi>France;</hi> that they were men not well affected, creatures of the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi> ſent by him to the Councel, for his owne deſeignes, had proteſted without the Kings commiſſion &amp; that it was fit to make them ſhew their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions &amp; to frame an <hi>Inquiſition</hi> againſt them, as not hauing a good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in matter of faith. Where in great differences did ariſe between the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours and them. The next day the Ambaſſadors gaue the King an account of the cauſes why they had deferred the proteſtation vntill then, and how they were forced, at that time, to come vnto it, adding, that they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the regiſtring of it in the acts of the Councell, vntill his Maieſty had ſeene it, and commanded them what they ſhould doe.</p>
            <p>The Legats not hauing a copie of the Oration made a collection of it by the memory of thoſe who had beeene moſt attentiue, to ſend it to the Pope; of which <hi>de Ferrieres,</hi> hauing gotten a copie, complained, that many things were expreſſed againſt his intention, and in particular, where hee named Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall lawes, it was repeated, ſpirituall lawes, and that Kings might take Church goods at their pleaſure, whereas hee had ſayd onely for neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſe. By this he was forced to giue foorth his Oration, and ſent a copie of it to <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> excuſing himſelfe for not hauing vſed words of ſuch acrimony as he was commanded in the laſt inſtructions, and in the firſt, which are reconfirmed in thoſe; adding alſo that he thought it neceſſary to obey the King, and was not willing to vndergoe the reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Counſellors of Parliament, who would haue taxed him, if in a Generall Councell, matters of ſo great importance had beene determined againſt that which hath beene by them ſo exactly maintained; beſides, the Kings authority, which hee defended, hauing beene vpheld foure hundred yeeres by the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> againſt the war, in oppoſition of it, made by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was not iuſt that the Fathers of the Councell, the greater part of whom are Courtiers, ſhould be Iudges of the ancient differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which the kingdome hath with that Court. He gaue a copie of the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Ambaſſadors alſo, and to as many as did deſire it, and ſome ſaide, that he had pronounced it otherwiſe then it was written. Whereunto hee replyed, that that could not bee ſaid by any that had any meane vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:17208:397"/>
of the <hi>Latine,</hi> and that, howſoeuer it was the ſame pronounced, and written, yet if they thought otherwiſe, they muſt remember that the ſtile of the Synod was neuer to iudge of things as they were deliuered in voyce, but as they were exhibited in writing, and therefore they ſhould moue no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie herein, or, if they would, himſelfe was to bee beleeued before any other.</p>
            <p>The oration being publiſhed, it was anſwered in the name of the Synod, <note place="margin">And anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> by a nameleſſe man. Hee ſaid, that the French Ambaſſadours had reaſon to compare themſelues to the Ambaſſadours of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> becauſe they had both made an vniuſt complaint againſt GOD; and that the ſame anſwere might be giuen them, which the Prophet gaue to that people, in the name of GOD, that if they had faſted and lamented ſo many yeeres, or ate and drunke, all was for their owne intereſts; that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> were cauſe of all the abuſes of that Kingdome, by naming to Biſhoprickes vnlearned perſons, ignorant in Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, and more inclined to a laſciuious then to a religious life; that the French-men would not haue a reſolution in the controuerſies of faith, that Chriſtian doctrine might allwayes be vncertaine, and place might be giuen to new maſters, who might rub the itching eares of that vnquiet Nation, that they ſpared not to ſay in thoſe turbulent times, that it belonged to the King, though very yong as yet, to diſpoſe of all the gouerment of the Church; that they had ſayd, with aſſeueration, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficed men had onely the vſe of the reuenues, whereas in <hi>France</hi> time out of mind they haue carried themſelues for <hi>Vſufructuaries,</hi> making Teſtaments, and receiuing inheritances from their kinsfolke, who die inteſtate; that to ſay the poore are owners of the reuenues, was much contrary to another ſaying in the ſame oration, that the King is Patron of all Eccleſiaſtical goods, and might diſpoſe of them at his pleaſure; that it was a great abſurdity, to ſay, that the King might not bee reprehended by a generall Councell, ſeeing that <hi>Dauid</hi> was reprehended by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> and tooke it in good part; that it did a little ſauour of hereſie to taxe Biſhops of theſe later times, as if they were not true Biſhops. In the end, hee ſpake at large againſt the ſaying of the Ambaſſador, that Kings are giuen by GOD, confuting it as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall, condemned by the <hi>extrauagant</hi> of <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, <hi>Vnam ſanctam,</hi> if hee did not diſtinguiſh, that they are from GOD, but by mediation of his <hi>Vicar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadour publiſhed an Apologie in anſwer of this writing, as if <note place="margin">Which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him to make an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie.</note> it had beene made to the Synod, ſaying, that the Fathers could not anſwere them as the Prophet did the <hi>Iewes;</hi> for they demaunded a reformation of the Cleargie, principally in <hi>France,</hi> knowing the defects of it, and not as the <hi>Iewes,</hi> to whom the cauſe of their faſting and lamentation was imputed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ignorant of their owne defects; that the Fathers, aſcribing the cauſe of the Eccleſiaſticall deformation to their Kings, ſhould take heede they did not like <hi>Adam,</hi> who layd the blame vpon the woman which God had giuen him for company; ſaying, it was a great fault in the Kings to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnworthy Biſhops, but a greater in the Popes to admit them; that they had deſired the reformation before the doctrine, not to leaue it vncertaine, but becauſe, all Catholiques conſenting therein, they thought it neceſſary to
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:17208:398"/>
begin with corrupted manners, the fountaine and ſource of all hereſies, that he was not ſorry hee had ſaid, that, in the Articles propoſed, there are many things repugnant to the ancient decrees, yea, he would adde that they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate alſo from the conſtitutions of the Popes of later times; that hee had ſaid that <hi>Charles</hi> the great, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the ninth, had conſtituted Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, by which <hi>France</hi> had beene gouerned, not that the preſent King did meane to make new, and if he had, he had ſpoken conformably to the holy Scripture, the ciuill lawes of the Romans, and to that which the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call authors, <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> doe write, before the booke of the Decrees; for ſaying that beneficed men had onely the vſe of the reuenues, hee asked pardon, becauſe he ſhould haue ſayd that they were onely Adminiſtrators, and that thoſe who take his ſaying in ill part, muſt complaine of <hi>Ierom, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> and the other Fathers, who did not ſay onely, that the Eccleſiaſticall goods did belong to the poore, but that Clergy men, like ſeruants, did gaine all for the Church; that he neuer ſaid that the King had free power ouer Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall goods, but that all did belong to the Prince, in time of inſtant and vrgent publike neceſſitie, and he that knew the force of thoſe words, did vnderſtand well, that, in ſuch a time, neither requeſt, nor authoritie of the Pope could take place; that he had reprehended the <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt Kings in that manner as it was ſet downe in the Articles, and did grant that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Magiſtrates might bee reprehended in that ſort as <hi>Nathan</hi> did, but that they ſhould not bee prouoked with iniuries and maledictions; that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing incited them, by the example of <hi>Ezekias,</hi> to make a reformation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the paterne of the ancient times, it could not bee inferred that he did not thinke the Biſhops of the laſt times to be lawfull, knowing very well that the Phariſes and Popes ſit in <hi>Moyſes</hi> chaire: that in ſaying the power of Kings commeth from God he hath ſaid abſolutely and ſimply, as the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle haue written, not remembring the diſtinction of <hi>mediate &amp; immediate,</hi> nor the Conſtitution of <hi>Boniface,</hi> of which if hee (being a French-man) had thought, he would haue repeated what the Stories ſay of the cauſe and beginning of that <hi>extrauagant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Apologie did not diminiſh the bad opinion conceiued againſt the Ambaſſadours, but increaſed it rather, it being (as they ſayd) not an excuſe <note place="margin">The gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>France</hi> is taxed by the Fathers.</note> of the error committed, but a pertinacie in maintaining it. And many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed not ſo much againſt the Ambaſſadours, as againſt the Kingdome. They ſayd, it did plainly appeare of what mind they were who managed the affaires of <hi>France.</hi> They noted the Queene Mother, that ſhee gaue credit to the <hi>Chaſtilons,</hi> eſpecially to him that had quitted the Cardinals Cap; that the Chancellor, and the Biſhop of <hi>Valence</hi> had too much power with her, at whoſe inſtance that vnluckie checke had beene giuen to the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> with the detriment of Religion; that ſhe had inward familiaritie with <hi>Curſor,</hi> and with his wife, whom, in reſpect of their Religion, ſhee ſhould not haue endured to looke vpon; That the Kings Court was full of Hugonots, exceedingly fauoured; that ſollicitation was ſtill vſed to ſell Eccleſiaſticall goods, to the great preiudice of the Church; and other things they ſayd of this nature.</p>
            <p>But while the Councell was in this motion, by meanes of theſe differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:17208:398"/>
the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> according to his vſe, to adde difficulties to thoſe which were propoſed by others, made inſtance for the abrogation of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponentibus Legatis.</hi> A thing which did much trouble them, becauſe they knew not how to content him, without preiudice of the formed Seſſions. For not onely the reuocation, but euery modification or ſuſpenſion, did ſeeme to bee a declaration, that they had not lawfully proceeded in the things paſt. But the Ambaſſadour, ſeeing nothing done concerning his demand, ſo often <note place="margin">The abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentibus Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatis</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted againe.</note> made, ſaid, that hitherto he had negotiated modeſtly, but ſhould bee forced to alter his courſe; and ſpake more boldly, becauſe the Pope, vpon his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inſtances, had written that they ſhould doe that which was conuenient, and did wholly referre himſelfe vnto them. The Legates, to be quit of his importunitie, anſwered, that they would leaue it in the liberty of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to make the declaration, if he thought good; and ſo the name of libertie of the Councel did ſerue to couer that, which did proceed from others. For the Legates did at the ſame time vſe ſtrong perſwaſions with the Prelates their friends, that a delay might bee interpoſed, to referre this particular to the end of the Councel, and to enioy the benefit of time, that ſome ouerture might bee made to ſome courſe leſſe preiudiciall. But the Count, hauing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the practiſes, prepared a proteſtation, deſiring the Emperours, French, and Portugal Ambaſſadours to ſubſcribe it; who perſwaded him not to bee ſo earneſt, at that time. For <hi>Morone,</hi> hauing promiſed the Emperour, that prouiſion ſhould bee made herein before the end of the Councel, vntill it were vnderſtood whether that would be performed or not, they knew not how hee could proteſt concerning the other. And Cardinall <hi>Morone,</hi> to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie the Count, ſent <hi>Paleotto</hi> often to negotiate with him, in what maner his requeſt might be granted: which himſelfe did not well vnderſtand; becauſe his meaning was not to preiudice the decrees paſt, and, with this condition, it was hard to finde a temper. In concluſion, the Legates gaue the Count theirword that the declaration ſhould be made in the next Seſſion, ſo that a meanes were found to ſatisfie the Fathers.</p>
            <p>Newes being come to <hi>Rome</hi> of the French proteſtation, the Pope, and the whole Court were wonderfully moued, thinking it was purpoſely done to diſſolue the Councel, and imputed it vnto them. But the Pope complained aboue all, that while the King did demaund a fauour, and a grant of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand crownes of the reuenues of the Clergie of <hi>France,</hi> his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours ſhould ſay, in the face of the whole Councell, that hee might take them without him. And the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> was troubled more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought it would be a great croſſe to his negotiation with his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. He laboured to make it appeare, that this did happen againſt his will, and that he would haue diuerted it, if he had been in <hi>Trent,</hi> that that inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was a remnant of the Councels taken in the life time of the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uar,</hi> and the execution procured by the dependants of that faction, of which <hi>de Ferrieres</hi> was one; that that faction, though it profeſſed the Catholique reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion outwardly, did hold ſtrict intelligence with the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> who deſired a diſſolution of the Councell without a quiet end, that they might not be ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiſed. But he ſaid, that thoſe who gouerne the affaires in <hi>Trent,</hi> were not without blame, in regard, that before his departure from that Citie, the
<pb n="778" facs="tcp:17208:399"/>
things concerning that matter, ſtood in good tearmes, the Legates hauing promiſed morethings, with which the Ambaſſadours were contented. One, that they would not ſpeake of Kings, and Soueraigne Princes, but onely of certaine little Lords, who grant to Biſhops no exerciſe of Eccleſiaſticall iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; the other, that all things depending on graces done by the Pope, ſhould bee excepted, as <hi>indulgences,</hi> priuiledges, and graunts of the holy <hi>Sea,</hi> &amp; notwithſtanding, ſince his departure, they had giuen to the Fathers the firſt forme, with the ſame things in it, which they had promiſed to take away. But he aſſured his Holineſſe, that, notwithſtanding this, the Councel ſhould haue a quiet end, and promiſed to write to the King, and complaine of that which was done, and to vſe meanes that the Ambaſſadours ſhould returne to <hi>Trent,</hi> which he hoped to obtaine.</p>
            <p>According to this promiſe, he wrote into <hi>France,</hi> and to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours. Theſe, he told that their action had this excuſe, that it was done, but that hereafter they ſhould continue in doing their duty, without making any more innouations. He wrote to the King, that the oppoſition made by the Ambaſſadours ſeemed vnto him very ſtrange; and the rather, becauſe they had done it without his priuitie, and that there was neither reaſon, nor occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for it; that his abſence from <hi>Trent</hi> was the cauſe why the Ambaſſadours had applied, out of ſeaſon, a ſharpe plaſter, to a ſmall ſore; that, at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, he would make prouiſion therein with great caſe. But becauſe things done alreadie could not bevndone he praied his Maieſtie to write to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, to continue in doing their dutie, and to abſtaine from violent courſes. He added, that he found the Pope well inclined, and diſpoſed to an holy and ſerious reformation of the Church; that Chriſtendome was happy in hauing ſo worthy a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> that hee ſent him backe to <hi>Trent,</hi> ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed of all his holy intentions, for the ending and concluſion of the Councel, that he might hope for an happy ſucceſſe. And becauſe, in the end of the Councel, the decrees muſt bee ſubſcribed by the Fathers, and Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours, who haue aſſiſted in the name of their Princes, he deſired the King to cauſe his Ambaſſadours to returne, that they may bee preſent, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh that which is the complement of the protection, and of all the fauours done to the Councel by his Maieſtie, by his Brother, Father, and Grand-father.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall had much adoe to defend himſelfe, not onely with the Pope, but with the Colledge of Cardinals alſo in Conſiſtory; who ſaid, that Princes deſired the liberty of the Councell, yet not in the leaſt and iuſteſt thing that concerne them, but onely for the deſtruction of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques. The Pope gaue order that better conſideration ſhould be had of that which was to bee written to <hi>Trent</hi> about that reformation, ſaying, hee did it, not to meddle in the affaires of the Councel, becauſe hee meant to let the Fathers alone, but onely to inſtruct the Legates, by way of counſell. But, in the meane while, hee wrote to the Legates, that if the French-men would depart, they ſhould doe it, but that they ſhould not giue them occaſion, but ſhould bee very carefull to hold the Seſſion at the time appointed, when <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine</hi> ſhould be returned, and to finiſh the Counſel with one Seſſion more, holding it within two or three weekes at the moſt; and that they ſhould
<pb n="779" facs="tcp:17208:399"/>
conceale this order, imparting it to none but to <hi>Loraine.</hi> And if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Ambaſſadours ſhould mooue them, they ſhould anſwere, that, at the arriuall of that Cardinall, they would reſolue what to doe. And he enco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them; ſaying, that hee had brought <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France</hi> to his purpoſe, and that nothing remained but <hi>Spaine,</hi> which anſwered, that it was not good to finiſh the Councell, becauſe many things, and the moſt principall did remaine to be handled. Notwithſtanding he had hope, he ſaid, to reduce it, and to conclude the Synode, with a generall ſatisfaction. And indeed hee was ſecure of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germanie.</hi> For beſides his treatie with <hi>Loraine,</hi> who did abundantly ſecure him of <hi>France,</hi> hee receiued at the ſame time a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Emperour, that he was content with the end, and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it. And howſoeuer his <hi>Nuncio</hi> aduiſed that his Maieſtie was doubtfull in reſoluing, and that there was danger he would change, yet, vnderſtanding that the King of the Romanes was author of the reſolution, ſaying, that it was good to finiſh it, becauſe it did no good, nor gaue any hope that it would doe, he was aſſured that that King, mooued by himſelfe, and by good reaſon, would perſeuere in his purpoſe, and, by conſequence, keepe his father in that opinion.</p>
            <p>But the French Ambaſſadours, after the Oration, did no more appeare publiquely in <hi>Trent.</hi> They let thoſe few Prelats remaining know, that the Kings pleaſure was that they ſhould oppoſe the fift Article and the ſecond, becauſe the perſons, and cauſes of <hi>France</hi> might by vertue of thoſe two, bee drawen to letigate out of the Kingdome; and the ninteenth, becauſe by it, the <hi>preuentions</hi> were canonized, and the Parlaments depriued of their prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues, in matter of benefices.</p>
            <p>The Legates, ſo ſoone as the Fathers had made an end of ſpeaking of the 21. Article propoſed vnto them the others alſo; wherein all the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours oppoſed, in regard of the matter concerning Princes. The Fathers complained, that, being to reforme, as alwaies hath been ſaid, all the Church, in the Head and in the members, in the end, the Princes would haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation but for the Clergie onely; which could not bee reformed neither, if the Prelates were hindered in performing their charges, and the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall liberty not preſerued. Notwithſtanding, the Princes, who ſeemed to deſire reformation, did oppoſe that decree which did reſtore vnto them their liberty and iuriſdiction, neceſſarie for it. The Legates excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ſaid, they muſt needs giue ſome ſatisfaction to the Prelates; that the Ambaſſadours had had time to alleadge their grieuances, and to handle the cauſe with reaſon, and that it was too much violence to oppoſe onely <hi>de facto,</hi> and to ſhew that the Councell is onely for reformation of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and not of the whole Church.</p>
            <p>Newes came at the ſame time, that the Emperour was very ſicke, and his <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſickneſſe troubleth the Fathers.</note> Ambaſſadours ſaid, that, in caſe hee ſhould die, the Councell would not be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, becauſe the ſafeduct would bee ended. The Legates ſent preſently to the Pope, for order what to doe, and the Prelates began to thinke more of pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="780" facs="tcp:17208:400"/>
with that which concerneth Princes. In which after long diſcuſſion, it was concluded that the Seſſion ſhould be celebrated with the matter of Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and the 21. Articles of reformation, and that of the Princes ſhould bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. The next day the French Ambaſſadors parted from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> according to the Kings order.</p>
            <p>The Pope, though well ſatisfied of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and of the French-men, his dependants, yet prouoked againſt that faction from which hee thought the <note place="margin">The French Ambaſſadors goe to <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </note> motiue of the proteſtation, made in Councell, came, hee reſumed his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, made at the time of the Edict of pacification with the Hugonots, to proceede in <hi>Trent</hi> againſt the Queene of <hi>Nauarre:</hi> which hee had put off, foreſeeing that the Emperors Ambaſſadors would oppoſe as they did when mention was made of proceeding againſt the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; reſolued to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </note> a ſentence to be publiſhed againſt the fiue French Biſhops formerly cited, as hath been ſayd, and a Citation to bee affixed to the gates of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church, and in other publique places, againſt <hi>Iohan</hi> Queene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the widow of <hi>Antonie,</hi> that, within the terme of ſixe moneths, ſhee ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to defend her ſelfe, and to ſhew reaſons why ſhe ſhould not bee depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all her Dignities, States, and Dominions, and the marriage betweene <hi>Antonie</hi> of <hi>

The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> before the Pope came to thoſe ſentences, and proceſſe, vſed perſwaſions to him, and put him in minde, that the <hi>maximes</hi> held in <hi>France</hi> did much differ from thoſe of <hi>Rome.</hi> For it would bee ill taken in that kingdome, that the cauſes of BB. in the firſt inſtance ſhould bee iudged in <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the Citation againſt the Queen, as well for the ſame cauſe, as in regard it was with temporall puniſhments, would giue matter of talke, and bad ſatisfaction to many. But thoſe perſwaſions being vnderſtood by the Pope, as they were made, brought forth no other fruit, but that which the Cardinall did ſecretly deſire. For the conference, which the Queene Mother ſo much deſired, by euery Currier that came from her, new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was made to the Pope. But newes came from the Emperours Court, that hee would not hearken vnto it; and out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> though complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall words of the Kings deſire to haue it effected, yet a reſolution that the times and coniunctures did not comport it. The Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> was of opinion, that howſoeuer there was no hope, yet the Pope ſhould not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to ſend expreſſe <hi>Nuncij</hi> for this purpoſe, as beeing an office whereon many other negotiations, for the ſeruice of the Apoſtolique Sea, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, and, in particular, to remooue impediments of the concluſion of the Councell, in caſe any ſhould ariſe. Whereupon <hi>Viſconte</hi> was diſpatched into <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Santa Croce</hi> into <hi>Germanie,</hi> in ſhew, to treat of this conference, but indeede, with other particular inſtructions.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Trent,</hi> the Legates, being not willing to giue occaſion of any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie while the Seſſion was expected, did propoſe <hi>Indulgences, Purgatory,</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Saints and images, not to publiſh the Decrees in the next Seſſion, but in the other following, adding the manner how the Diuines ought to handle thoſe matters, that is, to giue their opinion in writing only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:17208:400"/>
the vſe of them, and not to ſpeake of the other Articles, and giuing order to the fathers to deliuer their voyces in ſhort termes, proteſting that whoſoeuer would delate beſides the point, ſhould be interrupted. Notwithſtanding the Diuines made long writings, and ſo diuers, that the Fathers knew not what to reſolue in that doctrine.</p>
            <p>For the reformation, howſoeuer twentie Articles were concluded, and the one and twentieth treated on with the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> the Spaniſh Prelates complained that the Article of the exemption of Chapters, and the laſt, of the firſt inſtances, and appeales, were altered from that which was noted by the Prelats. Whereat the Legats, and Deputies for making the Decrees, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, anſwered, that either they ſhould iuſtifie what they ſaide, or holde their peace. And ſome words of diſtaſt paſsing, the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their fauour, demanding that the oppoſitions made by his Prelates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe two Articles might bee conſidered on. Afterwards, he deſired that in the firſt Article, in which the criminall cauſes of Biſhops were reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to the Pope, a declaration ſhould be made, that no preiudice ſhould bee done to the <hi>inquiſition</hi> of <hi>Spaine;</hi> which requeſt the Ambaſſador of <hi>Portugal</hi> had firſt made for his kingdome. And the Legates anſwering, that thoſe matters were already decided, the Count replyed, that if they ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſo, he would not go into the Seſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor ſuffer any of his Prelats to enter. Whereupon Cardinal <hi>Morone</hi> ſaid, that if they would not go into the Seſſion, it ſhould be done without them. The Count aſcribing this rigiditie of the Legats to the Proctor of the Chapters of <hi>Spaine,</hi> he commanded him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part immediatly from <hi>Trent;</hi> which diſpleaſed the Legats. But that nothing might hinder the Seſſion, the time whereof did draw nigh, to pleaſe the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in the Article of the cauſes of Biſhops, they cauſed kingdoms, where the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> was, to bee excepted. For that of the firſt inſtances, becauſe they would wholly take from the Pope all authoritie to make commiſſions in <hi>Rome,</hi> the Legats thought it too hard. The ſixt alſo did import very much. For the Chapters of <hi>Spaine</hi> are a very principall member, and doe more depend on the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea</hi> them Biſhops doe; becauſe theſe are all by the nomination of Kings, whereas more then halfe of the Canonries are of the Popes pure collation. Therefore they reſolued to deferre this matter vntill the next Seſſion, rather then to preiudice the Canons. And they imployed the Emperours Ambaſſadours to perſwade the Count to be content with it, by which meanes that difficultie alſo was ouercome.</p>
            <p>The declaration of <hi>Propenentibus Legatis</hi> did remaine. For which not being able to find a temper, they tolde the Count, that hee ſhould propoſe a forme how he would haue it done. Wherein hee excuſing himſelfe, they deputed three Canoniſts to treat with him, and to find a meanes that might pleaſe him, ſo that it were not to alter the way preſcribed by the Pope. But <note place="margin">The Card of <hi>Loraine</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to <hi>Trent</hi> and haſteneth, the end of the Councell.</note> the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> came fitly for that occaſion, who being parted from <hi>Rome</hi> with inſtruction and concluſion of all things, and hauing tooke <hi>Venice</hi> in his way, to perſwade the Ambaſſadours to returne before the end of the Councell, and now arriued in <hi>Trent,</hi> cauſed, with his desteritie, the Count to approoue that manner, by which that difficultie, ſo much agitated, receiued an end, with ſatisfaction of all and it was made the one and twentieth Article
<pb n="782" facs="tcp:17208:401"/>
of reformation, propoſed in the Congregation of the ninth of Nouember held for this purpoſe, and approoued with ſmall reſiſtance. After this, the ſecond Article was taken away, which being done, all the Articles were read ouer againe, and the ſuffrages briefly deliuered. In which <hi>Loraine,</hi> to ſalue his honour, ſaid, that howſoeuer he deſired a greater reformation, yet, knowing that in the beginning one could not come to the laſt remedies, hee aſſented to the Decrees, not iudging them ſufficient, but hoping that the Pope, either by bringing the old Canons into vſe, or by celebrating other generall Councels, would adde a perfection.</p>
            <p>It is worthy of memorie that, in this Congregation, hee made a long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, <note place="margin">He maketh an Oration in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Pope</note> in forme of an encomiaſticall Oration, of the Popes good will, of his deſire to ſee the Church reformed, the Epiſcopall degree reſtored to its anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent dignitie, and the Councell ended, with the fruit of all Chriſtendome. The Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Granata,</hi> when it was his turne to ſpeake, brake out into the Popes commendation alſo, attributing as much vnto him as the other, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that either the Pope did iudge that he could not doe as he would, or had not authority to make his miniſters and dependants to execute his will Here I muſt make a great mutation of ſtile. For whereas in the former narration I haue vſed that which is proper to deſcribe varietie of minds, and opinions, <note place="margin">The state of the Councel is quite altered.</note> one croſsing the deſignes of another, and delayes of reſolutions interpoſed, framing my ſelfe to declare the counſels of diuers, ſometimes contrary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues, hereafter I muſt make relation of one aime only, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme operations, which ſeeme rather to flie then run to one only end, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I can giue but one cauſe, not to repeate it in all places, that is; the ioynt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to precipitate the Councell.</p>
            <p>Therefore to ſpeake ſimply, I muſt ſay, that Letters came from the Pope, with reſolution that the Councell ſhould bee ended, though with diſtaſt of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> becauſe hee had meanes to make an agreement with him that they ſhould eſtabliſh the Decree of ſecret marriage, with as much vnion as was poſsible, but yet to doe it, though the ſame oppoſition ſhould continue; that, for the reformation of Princes, and reſtitution of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall iuriſdiction and libertie, they ſhould not deſcend to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar but renew the ancient Canons, and without <hi>Anathemaes;</hi> that if any difficultie did ariſe, concerning the other Articles, they ſhould reſerue it for him, who would make prouiſion therein; referring them, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue, to the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> who was fully informed of his whole will, whom they ought to beleeue. Afterwards, hee ſent a forme in what ſort they ſhould finiſh the Councell; which did containe, that all things done vnder <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iulius</hi> ſhould be confirmed, and declared that they were all done in this one Councell, and that, in all things, the authoritie of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike <hi>Sea</hi> ſhould be preſerued; that of the things decreed the Popes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation ſhould be demanded, that all the Fathers ſhould ſubſcribe, and, after them according to the example of the ancient Emperours, there ſhould be a ſubſcription of the Ambaſſadors, that the Princes might be bound to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance of the Decrees, and to perſecute with Armes thoſe of the contrary religion, leauing it in the power of them, the Legats, together with <hi>Loraine</hi> to adde, diminiſh, or alter, according to opportunite.

The Articles of reformation of Matrimony beeing read to the firſt, of the annullation of the clandeſtine, Cardinall <hi>Morone</hi> ſaid, that it <note place="margin">Varietie of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions about clandeſtine mariages.</note> pleaſed him, if it pleaſed the Pope. <hi>Simoneta</hi> ſaid it did not pleaſe him but referred himſelfe to the Pope. Of the others ſixe and fifty did abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, and all the reſt did approoue it.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the Decrees of reformation were read. And beeing come to <note place="margin">The Decrees of reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> the fift, of the criminall cauſes of Biſhops, perceiuing the Kingdomes, where the inquiſition is, were excepted, a great commotion was raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Fathers, the Lombards and Neapolitans ſaying confuſedly, that that exception was neuer propoſed in Congregation, and that it ought to bee remoued; which they were forced preſently to doe. Afterwards the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> ſayd, concerning the ſame poynt, that hee did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue the Decree, vpon condition that it did not preiudice any of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uileges, rights, and conſtitutions of the Kings of <hi>Frange,</hi> as had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Congregation the day before, declaring that they did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice the authoritie of any Prince. And, in the end of the Decrees, hee made a proteſtation, in his owne name, and of the other French Prelates, wholly conformable to that other, made two dayes before, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; that is, that their nation did receiue thoſe decrees, not as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reformation, but as a preparation to one entire, hoping the Pope would ſupplie the defects in time, and occaſion, by bringing into vſe the old, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; or by celebrating other generall Councels, to giue a perfection to
<pb n="784" facs="tcp:17208:402"/>
the things begun. And hee deſired, in the name of all the French Biſhops, that this might bee inſerted in the Actes of the Councell, and a publique inſtrument made of it. Diuers other things were added by others, and ſome oppoſitions, of no great moment, made againſt ſome of the Articles, where in ſome differences ariſing, it was ſaid, they ſhould be accommodated in a general Congregation becauſe it was then late 2 houres within night. And for the concluſion of the Seſſion, the Decree of the intimation of the next for the ninth of December, was read, with power to anticipate, declaring that the ſixth Article now deferred, and other Articles of reformation exhibited, and other things belonging thereunto, ſhould then bee handled, adding that in caſe it ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> fit, and the time comport, ſome doctrines may be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, as they ſhall bee in their times propoſed in the Congregations.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the Sacrament of Matrimonie did containe. That <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> did pronounce the bond of Matrimonie to be perpetuall, and that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two perſons may bee ioyned therein, a thing more plainely declared by CHRIST who alſo by his paſſion, hath merited grace to confirme it, and to ſanctifie thoſe who are ioyned. Which is intimated by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when hee ſayd that this was the great Sacrament in CHRIST and the Church. Whereupon Matrimony in the Euangelicall Law, exceeding the ancient mariages, by addition of grace, it is iuſtly numbred amongſt the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the new law. Therefore the Synode, condemning the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in this matter, doth conſtitute the <hi>Anathematiſmes</hi> 1. Againſt him that ſhall ſay, that Matrimonie is not one of the ſeuen Sacraments, inſtituted by CHRIST, and doth not conferre grace. 2. Or that it is lawfull for Chriſtians to haue many wiues at once, and that this is not forbidden by any Law of God. 3. Or that onely the degrees of affinitie, and conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity, expreſſed in <hi>Leuiticus</hi> may nullifie the mariage, and that the Church may not adde others, or diſpence with ſome of them. 4. That the Church cannot conſtitute impediments, or hath erred in conſtituting them. 5. That one of thoſe who are maried may diſſolue the Matrimony, for hereſie, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome conuerſation, or voluntary abſence of the other. 6. Or that lawfull matrimonie, not conſummated, is not diſſolued by a ſolemne religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vow. 7. Or that the Church hath erred in teaching, that the matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall bond is not diſſolued by adultery. 8. Or that the Church doth erre, in ſeparating thoſe who are married for a determinate or indeterminate time, in reſpect of carnall coniunction, or cohabitation. 9. Or that the Eccleſiaſtiques of holy <hi>Order,</hi> or profeſſed Regulars may marry, as alſo all thoſe who finde they haue not the gift of chaſtitie, in regard that GOD doeth not denie the gift to him that doeth demaund it. 10. Or that ſhall preferre the ſtate of mariage to virginitie, and chaſtitie. 11. Or that the prohibition of mariage, in certaine times of the yeere, is ſuperſtition, or ſhall condemne the benedictions and other ceremonies. 12 Or that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall cauſes doe not belong to Eccleſiaſticall Iudges.</p>
            <p>The Decrees of the reformation of Matrimony did containe. 1. That howſoeuer it be true, that clandeſtine mariages haue beene true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſo long as the Church hath not diſallowed them, and that the Synode doth <hi>anathematize</hi> him who doth not hold them for ſuch, as alſo thoſe who
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:17208:402"/>
affirme, that mariages, contracted without conſent of parents, in whoſe power the maried parties are, is voyde, and that the Fathers may either ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue or diſprooue it, yet the Church hath euer forbid, and deteſted them. And becauſe prohibitions doe no good, the Synode doth command, that the matrimony ſhall be denounced in the Church three Feſtiuall dayes, before it bee contracted, and no impediment being found, ſhall bee celebrated in the face of the Church, where the Pariſh Prieſt hauing interrogated the man and the woman, and heard their conſent, ſhall ſay, <hi>I ioyne you in matrimony in the name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſhall vſe other words, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed in the Prouince. Notwithſtanding the Synod doth referre it to the will of the Biſhop, to omit the <hi>Banes</hi> but doth declare thoſe to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of mariage, who attempt to contract it without the preſence of the Pariſh Prieſt, or another Prieſt of equall authority, and of two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, making void and nullifying ſuch contracts, and puniſhing the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours. Afterwards, it doth exhort the parties maried, not to dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before the benediction, and command the Pariſh Prieſt to haue a booke, in which mariages, ſo contracted ſhall be written. It doth exhort the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that are to be maried, to confeſſe, and communicate before the contract, or conſummation of the mariage, reſerueth the cuſtomes and ceremonies of euery Prouince; and will haue this Decree to bee of force within thirtie daies after it ſhall be publiſhed in euery Pariſh.</p>
            <p>Secondly, concerning the impediments of mariage, the Synode doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the multitude of prohibitions did cauſe great ſins and ſcandals. Therefore it doth reſtraine that of ſpiritual cognation, to that which the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and their parents haue with the god-fathers and god-mothers, and the number of theſe to one man &amp; one woman only Ordaining the ſame about the kinred which doth ariſe by the ſacrament of Confirmation. 3. It doth reſtraine the <hi>impediment of honeſtie,</hi> which hath its beginning from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, to the firſt degree onely. 4. That of affinity by fornication, to the firſt and ſecond. 5. It doth take away all hope of diſpenſations for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, wittingly contracted in degrees prohibited, and to thoſe who haue ignorantly contracted, without the ſolemnities, in caſe of probable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, a diſpenſation may be giuen <hi>gratis.</hi> But to contract in degrees pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, a diſpenſation ſhall neuer be granted, or ſeldome onely, for a iuſt cauſe, without coſt; nor in the ſecond degree amongſt Princes, except for a publique cauſe. 6. Matrimony ſhall not bee contracted with a woman ſtollen away, ſo long as ſhee is in the power of him that did ſteale her; and doth declare thoſe <hi>Raptors,</hi> and thoſe that doe aſſiſt them with counſell, aid, or fauour, excommunicated, infamous, vncapable of all dignity; and the <hi>Raptor,</hi> whether hee many the woman or not, ſhall bee bound to giue her a dowry, at the pleaſure of the Iudge. 7. It doth ordaine, that vagabonds ſhall not marry without a diligent inquiſition firſt made, and licence of the Ordinary, exhorting the ſecular Magiſtrates to puniſh them ſeuerely. 8. It doth ordaine againſt <hi>Concubinaries,</hi> that being admoniſhed thrice by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, in caſe they ſeperate not themſelues, they ſhall be excommunicated, and perſeuering one yeere after the cenſure, the Ordinarie ſhall proceed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely againſt them, and the <hi>Concubines</hi> after three admonitions, ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:17208:403"/>
and, if the Biſhop ſhall thinke fit, chaſed alſo out of the Territorie, by aſſiſtance of the ſecular power. 9. It commandeth euery temporall Lord and Magiſtrate, vpon paine of excommunication, not to compell their ſubiects, or any others, to marry, directly or indirectly. 10. It doth reſtraine the ancient prohibitions of nuptiall ſolemnities, from <hi>Aduent,</hi> to the <hi>Epiphany,</hi> and from <hi>Aſh wedneſday,</hi> to the <hi>Octaues</hi> of <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Decrees of reformation, not as they were read in Seſſion, but as they were corrected the next day in Congregation (which was appoynted <note place="margin">The Decrees of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to be don) did containe. 1. That publike prayers ſhall be made, though the Church be vacant, that whoſoeuer haue right in the promotion, ſhall be admoniſhed that it is a mortall ſinne, if they ſhall not vſe all diligence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the moſt worthy, and profitable for the Church, borne of lawfull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, worthy in regard of their life, age, doctrine, and of other qualities required by the holy Canons, &amp; Decrees of this Councel. That in euery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall Synod, a forme of examination ſhall be preſcribed, by approbation of the Pope, fit for euery place, &amp; the examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made according to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript ſhall be ſent to the Pope, to be diſcuſſed by the Cardinals, &amp; propoſed in Conſiſtorie; and all other things required by the Synod for age, life, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, &amp; other qualities in the promotion of BB. ſhal be required in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cardinals, though but Deacons, which the Pope, if he can conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, ſhall take out of all Nations, and thoſe that are fit. And it was added; that the Synod being grieued to ſee ſuch great incommodities of the Church, cannot chooſe but call to mind, how neceſſary it is, that the Pope, in regard of his duty, ſhould endeauour to aſſume Cardinals of excellent worth, and to prouide the Church of fit Paſtours, becauſe if the flocke ſhould periſh by their negligence, CHRIST will demand an acount of his Holineſſe. 2. That the prouinciall Councel ſhall be called by the Metropolitane, or, the moſt ancient Suffragane, within one yeere at the moſt after the end of this Synode, and afterwards euery two yeeres at the leaſt. That Biſhops ſhall not bee forced heereafter to goe to the Metropolitane Church. That thoſe who haue not an Arch-biſhop ſhall elect one in the prouinciall Synod, in which hee ought to aſſiſt, and receiue the conſtitutions thereof, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions and priuiledges otherwiſe remaining firme. And the Dioceſan Synods ſhall bee celebrated euery yeere, in which the exempted, except thoſe who are ſubiect to general Chapters, ſhall aſſiſt. Which generall Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters hauing ſecular Churches annexed, in regard of them, ſhall aſſiſt alſo. 3. Biſhops ſhall bee bound to viſite the Dioceſſe euery yeere, either in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or by viſitors, and all of it, if they can, or, if it be large, in two yeeres at the leaſt. Metropolitans ſhall not viſite the Dioceſſe of the Suffragans, but for a cauſe, approoued in the prouinciall Councel. The Arch deacons, and other inferiours, ſhall viſite in perſon, and ſhall take a Notary, by conſent of the Biſhop. The Viſitor ſhall goe with a modeſt traine of men, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, diſpatching the viſitation as ſoone as may bee; and ſhall not receiue any thing but frugall and moderate diet, which may be giuen either in kind or money; yet ſo as that if there bee a cuſtome in any place not to receiue ſo much as theſe, it ſhall be obſerued alſo. That Patrons ſhall not meddle with that which concerneth the adminiſtration of Sacraments, or the viſitation
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:17208:403"/>
of the ornaments of the Church, immoueable goods, or rents of houſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it do belong vnto them by right of the foundation. 4. That Biſhops ſhall be bound to preach in perſon, or, hauing a lawful impediment, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And in caſe the Pariſh Prieſt be hindred that hee cannot preach in his owne Church, hee ſhall, at his charge, maintaine another to doe it, deputed by the Biſhops. And he ſhall preach euery Sunday and ſolemne feaſt, and in <hi>Aduent</hi> and <hi>Lent,</hi> euery day, or thrice a weeke at the leaſt. That the Biſhop ſhall admoniſh euery one to go to his owne Pariſh, to heare the ſermon. That none ſhall preach againſt the Biſhops will, whoſe cure ſhall be, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrine be taught in euery Pariſh. 5. That criminall cauſes againſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops that be of great weight, ſhall bee iudged by the Pope, and if there ſhall be occaſion to commit them to any out of the Court, they ſhall be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely to the Metropolitan, or to Biſhops elected by the Pope, and to take information onely, reſeruing the definitiue to the Pope: but ſmall matters ſhall bee iudged in the Prouinciall Councell, or by Iudges deputed by them. 6. That the Biſhops ſhall diſpenſe in the Court of Conſcience, with all their ſubiects, in all their irregularities, and ſuſpenſions for ſecret offences, except voluntary murther, and abſolue from all caſes reſerued to the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> either by himſelfe or his Vicar, as alſo from the exceſſe of hereſie, by himſelfe, but not by a Vicar. 7. That the Biſhop ſhall haue care that the force and vſe of the Sacraments ſhall be expounded to the people in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue before they bee adminiſtred, according to the forme of a Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cechiſme, which the Synod will compoſe, which the Biſhop ſhall cauſe to be faithfully tranſlated into the vulgar, and to be expounded to the people by the Pariſh Prieſts. 8. That to publike offenders publike Penance ſhall be giuen, but the Biſhop ſhall haue power to change it into a ſecret. In euery Cathedrall Church a <hi>Penitentiarie,</hi> Maſter, Doctor, or Licentiate in Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, or Canon, of the age of fourtie yeeres, ſhall bee appointed by the Biſhop. 9. That the Decrees of the Councell, vnder <hi>Paul</hi> the third, and <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, concerning viſitation of benefices exempted, ſhall be obſerued in the Churches which are not of any Dioceſſe, which ſhall bee viſited by the next Biſhop, as Delegate of the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea.</hi> 10. That where viſitation or correction of maners is in queſtion, no exemption or appeale, though to the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> ſhall hinder or ſuſpend the execution of that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed or adiudged. 11. That for titles of honour which are giuen to Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notaries, Count <hi>Palatines,</hi> Kings Chaplaines, or ſeruants in war, Monaſteries, Hoſpitals, thoſe perſons ſhall not be exempt from the authoritie of Biſhops, except they ſhall reſide in the houſes, or vnder their obedience, and Kings Chaplaines, according to the conſtitutions of <hi>Innocentius</hi> the 3. And exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons granted to the ſeruants of Cardinals, ſhall not be extended to that which concerneth benefices. 12. That no perſon vnder the age of twenty fiue yeeres, ſhall be promoted to dignities with cure; and the Arch-deacons, if it may be, ſhall be Maſters in Theologie, or Doctors, or Licentiate in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law. And none, vnder the age of two and twenty yeeres, ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to any dignitie without cure. Thoſe that are promoted to Benefices with Cure, ſhall bee bound to make profeſſion of their faith with in two moneths; and Canons ſhall doe the ſame. And none ſhall be receiued to any
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:17208:404"/>
dignitie, Canonry, or portion, except he ſhall haue that order, which it doth require, and that age which is neceſſary for the receiuing of it. That in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Churches, all the Canons and Portionaries ſhall be Prieſts, Deacons, or Subdeacons, and the Biſhop, with the <hi>Chapter,</hi> ſhall diſtribute how many ſhall bee of euery order, but ſo, as that one halfe at the leaſt ſhall bee Prieſts. The Synod doth exhort alſo, that all the dignities, and halfe the Canonries in the Cathedrall and famous Collegiat Churches may bee conferred vpon Doctors in Diuinitie, or in the Canon Law, and that none may bee abſent more then three moneths in the yeere. That the daily diſtributions may not be giuen vpon any pretence whatſoeuer, to any that hath not beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the offices, and that euery one ſhall performe his office in his owne perſon, not by ſubſtitutes. 13. There being many poore Cathedrall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, a remedy ſhall bee conſulted on in the Prouinciall Councell, and the Pope deſired to make prouiſion according to his wiſedome. The Biſhop alſo ſhall haue care to prouide for poore Pariſh Churches, either by vnion of ſome Benefice not regular, or by aſſignation of firſt fruits, or tithes, or by contributions and collections of the Pariſhioners. Pariſh Churches ſhall not be vnited to Monaſteries, Canonries, ſimple benefices, and religious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Souldiers, and thoſe that are vnited ſhall bee reviewed by the <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and the Cathedrall Churches, not exceeding a thouſand crownes, and the Pariſh Churches, not exceeding an hundred crownes, ſhall not be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after burthened with penſions, or reſeruations of fruits. Where the Pariſhes haue no certaine confines, but the Sacraments are adminiſtred indifferently to thoſe that doe demaund them, the Biſhop ſhall confine them, and they ſhall haue their proper Pariſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>eſt. And in Cities which haue no Pariſhes, they ſhall bee erected as faſt as may bee. 14. The Synod doth deteſt, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all inſtitutions or cuſtomes of paying any thing for the obtaining of ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, or poſſeſſions, except it be conuerted into pious vſes, declaring them to be ſimoniacall who ſhall vſurpe herein. 15. In Cathedrall and Collegiate Churches where the Prebends and diſtributions are too ſmal, the Biſhop ſhal haue power to vnite ſimple Benefices, or to reduce them to a ſmaller number. 16. The Epiſcopall <hi>Sea</hi> being voyd, the <hi>Chapter</hi> ſhall elect one or two <hi>Economickes,</hi> or a Vicar, within eight dayes, or, if not, this authoritie ſhall be deuolued to the Metropolitane. And the Biſhop when he ſhall bee created, ſhall take of them an account of the adminiſtration; and puniſh them, if they haue offended. 17. That no Eccleſiaſticall perſon, though a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſhall haue more then one Benefice, which not being able to maintaine him honeſtly, another ſimple Benefice may bee added, ſo that they doe not both require perſonall reſidence, which ſhall be vnderſtood of all Benefices, as well ſecular as regular, of what title or qualitie ſoeuer, though commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And hee that hath now more Benefices then one ſhall bee bound to leaue all but one, within ſixe moneths, or if not, they ſhall be all voyd. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, the Synod doeth deſire that ſome prouiſion ſhould bee made for thoſe that reſigne, in ſome conuenient manner, as ſhall ſeeme beſt to the Pope. 18. In caſe of vacancie of any Church in any manner whatſoeuer, all ſhall be written downe that are propoſed or doe propoſe themſelues, and ſhall bee all examined by the Biſhop with three examiners, at the leaſt, and
<pb n="789" facs="tcp:17208:404"/>
amongſt all thoſe which ſhall bee iudged fit, the Biſhop ſhall elect the moſt ſufficient, vpon whom the collation of the Church ſhall be made; and in Eccleſiaſticall patronages, the Patron ſhall preſent to the Biſhop him that is moſt worthy. But in Lacke patronages he that is preſented by the Patrons ſhall be examined by the examiners, and not admitted, except he be found to be fit. And <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Examiners ſhall bee propoſed euery yeere in the Dioceſan Synod, of which the Biſhop ſhall elect three, who ſhall bee Maſters, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, Secularor Regular, ſhall ſweare to performe their duety, and ſhall not receiue anything, either before or after the examination. That expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatiue graces for Benefices ſhall not bee granted hereafter, nor any other, extending to Benefices that ſhall bee vacant; and withall, the mentall reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations ſhall be prohibited. 19. That cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, euen benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall alſo, ſhall bee iudged by the Ordinarie in the firſt inſtance, and ended within two yeeres at the moſt. That there ſhall be no appeale but from the definitiue ſentence, or from that which ſhall haue the force thereof, except in thoſe which the Pope ſhall thinke fit to call to himſelfe, for an vrgent and reaſonable occaſio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap> That matrimoniall and criminall cauſes ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to the Biſhop onely. That in matrimoniall, thoſe that are proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be poore, ſhall not bee forced to litigate out of the Prouince, neither in the ſecond or third inſtance, except the aduerſe part will allow food and charges of the ſuit. That the Legats, <hi>Nuncij,</hi> and Eccleſiaſticall gouernours, ſhall not hinder Biſhops in their cauſes, nor proceed againſt Eccleſiaſticall perſons, but in caſe of the Biſhops negligence. That the Appellant ſhall be bound to bring at his charge, the actes made before the Biſhop, to the Iudge of the appeale, which the Notarie, being conueniently payed, ſhall be bound to giue within one moneth at the fartheſt. 20. That in the words of the decree, made in the firſt Seſſion vnder the preſent Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, that is, <hi>Proponentibus Legatis,</hi> the meaning of the Synod was not to change in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part the vſuall manner of handling matters in generall Councels, nor to adde or detract any thing, beſides that which hath beene conſtituted hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the ſacred Canons, and by the generall Synods. In the end, the next Seſſion was intimated for the ninth of December, with power of anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to handle the ſixt Article, and the other which were propoſed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and other points alſo, as opportunitie ſhould ſerue, and as they ſhould be propoſed in Congregation.</p>
            <p>There was not ſuch expectation of the iſſue of this Seſſion, as of the laſt, as well becauſe the generall curioſitie was then ſatisfied, as becauſe it did ſeeme that the matter of Matrimonie could not affoord any thing of any great obſeruation. The world was more attentiue to ſee what iſſue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation made by the French Ambaſſadours would haue: which was read with varietie of affections. Thoſe who were ill affected to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> did commend it, as true, and neceſſarie. But the Popes adherents thought it as abominable, as the Proteſtations formerly made by <hi>Luther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſixt <hi>Anathematiſme</hi> of Matrimonie, many did wonder, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution <note place="margin">The cenſure of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</note> of mariage not conſummated, for a ſolemne vow, ſhould bee made an Article of faith, becauſe the matrimoniall coniunction, though not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated by carnall copulation, is a bond inſtituted by the Law of GOD.

            <p>In the ſeuenth it was thought to bee a captious ſpeech, to condemne for an hereticke him that ſhall ſay that the Church hath erred, in reaching that, Matrimonie is not diſſolued by adulterie. For if one ſhould ſay abſolutely, that Matrimony ought to be diſſolued for that cauſe, without ſaying or thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that one hath erred, or not erred in teaching the contrary, it ſeemeth that this man ſhould not bee comprehended: and yet it doeth not appeare how one can thinke ſo, except the hold the contrary to bee an errour.

               </gap> diſſolued by adulterie, or that both opinions are probable, and not to make an Article of faith concerning a word onely. But theſe men would not haue made the difficultie, if they had knowen the cauſes before mentioned, why they did ſpeake in that maner.</p>
            <p>The ninth Canon did affoord matter of ſpeech alſo, by that affirmatiue, that God doth not deny the gift of chaſtitie to him that doth demaund it a right, becauſe it did ſeeme to be contrary to the Goſpel, which affirmeth that it is not giuen to all; and to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who doth not exhort to demaund it, which was more eaſie then to marry.</p>
            <p>The Polititians knew not what to thinke of the twelfth <hi>Anathematiſmem;</hi> that it ſhould bee hereſie to hold that matrimoniall cauſes doe not belong to Eccleſiaſticall Iudges, it being certaine, that the Lawes of mariage were all made by the Emperours, and the iudicature of them adminiſtred by the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Magiſtrates, ſo long as the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes were in force, which the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding onely of the <hi>Theodoſian</hi> and <hi>Iuſtinian Codes,</hi> and of the <hi>Nouels,</hi> doth eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrate. And in the formes of <hi>Caſsiodore</hi> there is mention of termes vſed by the <hi>Gothiſh</hi> Kings in the diſpenſations of degrees prohibited, which then were thought to belong to ciuill gouernment, and not to bee matters of religion, and to him that hath any skill in ſtory, it is moſt knowen, that the Eccleſiaſtiques began to iudge cauſes of this nature partly by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and partly by negligence of Princes and Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>But in the beginning of the Decree of reformation of Matrimony, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wondred, how it could bee defined as an Article of faith, that clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine mariages are true Sacraments, and that the Church hath alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted them, becauſe it doeth implie a contradiction to deteſt Sacraments, And to command that the Pariſh Prieſt ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>gate thoſe that are ioyned, and vnderſtanding their conſent, ſhould ſay, <hi>I ioyne you in Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt,</hi> was derided by the criticks; ſaying, that either they are ioyned by thoſe words, or not if not, then that is not true which the Councell of <hi>Florence</hi> hath determined, that matrimony receiueth perfection from conſent if ſo, what coniunction is that which the Prieſt maketh of perſons ioyned before. And if the word, I ioyne, ſhould
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:17208:405"/>
be expounded, I declare them ioyned a way would be layd open to conclude, that the words of the abſolution are declaratory alſo. But howſoeuer it was, they ſaid the decree was made to no other end, but that within a ſhort time it might bee made an Article of faith that thoſe words pronounced by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Prieſt were the forme of the Sacrament.</p>
            <p>For making void clandeſtine mariages, they ſpake as much as was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it in the Councell it ſelfe. For ſome did extoll the decree to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens; and others ſaid, that if thoſe matrimonies were Sacraments, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently inſtituted by CHRIST, and the Church hath alwayes deteſted them, and finally made them voyd, it did not appeare how thoſe who had not made prouiſion for it in the beginning, could be excuſed from the blame of ignorance, or negligence. And when the diſtinction, on which they founded the decree, was publiſhed, that the contract was nullified, which is the matter of the Sacrament, it was hard to vnderſtand a long time, becauſe the matrimoniall contract hath no diſtinction from the matrimony, nor the matrimony from the Sacrament: and the rather, becauſe the matrimony was indiſſoluble before it was a Sacrament, in regard CHRIST doeth not pronounce it inſoluble, as inſtituted by him, but as by GOD, in the earthly Paradiſe. But, it being admitted, that the Matrimoniall contract is an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and ciuill thing, ſeparate from the Sacrament, which is nullified, ſome ſaid this annullation would not belong to the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge, but to the Secular, to whom the diſcuſſion, and cognition of all ciuill contracts doeth appertaine.</p>
            <p>The cauſe alleadged to moderate the impediments of mariage, was much commended, as reaſonable; but it was obſerued withall, that it did neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conclude many more reſtrictions then thoſe that were decreed, in regard there are no leſſe inconueniences by the impediments confirmed, then by thoſe that were aboliſhed. The end of the Article of matrimoniall diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions mooued a vaine queſtion in the curious, whether the Pope, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing them to himſelfe alone, did more good or hurt to his authoritie. For the good, was alleadged the great quantitie of gold which did flow into the Court, through this chanell, and the obligations of ſo many Princes, gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by this meanes, as to be ſatisfied in their appetites, or intereſts, ſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Papall authoritie, on which onely the legitimation of their children was grounded: For the hurt, the loſſe of the reuenues of <hi>England,</hi> and of the obedience of that crowne was produced, which did weigh downe all gaine or friendſhip, which the dipenſations might procure.</p>

               </gap>all authoritie, and that it was an artifice to take the iudicature of that delict from the ſecular Magiſtrate. For if the Eccleſiaſtique may make the Law, hee may iudge the cauſe. And howſoeuer they ſaid abſolutely, at the pleaſure of the iudge, yet there is no doubt, but that in the declaration, they would ſay they meant the Eccleſiaſticall onely. And they thought it an vſurpation of temporall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to puniſh Seculars with infamie, and incapacitie of dignities. Neither did they approoue the conſtitution againſt <hi>conculinaries,</hi> any a yeere

in excommunication, that they ſhould be puniſhed by the Eccleſiaſtique, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe excommunication is the extreme, laſt and greateſt of Eccleſiaſticall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, according to the doctrine of all the Fathers; ſo that to paſſe that, was to enter vpon the Temporall power, and the rather, becauſe they giue themſelues power to courſe concubines out of their countreys, deriding the ſecular Magiſtrates, by imploring their arme, if there ſhall bee need; which is as much as to affirme, that, ordinarily, the execution of this baniſhment may be made by the Eccleſiaſtique himſelfe.</p>
            <p>The Decree of reformation in the firſt Article was noted either of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or of preſumption. For if the Synode had authoritie to giue Law to the Pope, eſpecially in things ſo iuſt, it was not fit to doe it by way of narration, or by obloquitie of words. But if it ought to receiue Law from the Pope, it cannot bee excuſed for hauing paſſed its bounds, becauſe it doeth ſharpely reprehend the former actions of this and other Popes, though it doeth it obliquely: Thoſe that were ſeene in the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſtories, ſaid, that to draw all the cauſes of Biſhops to <hi>Rome,</hi> was a new policie to make the Court great, whereas all the examples of antiquitie, and Canons of the Counſels of thoſe times doe ſhew, that the cauſes of Biſhops, though of depoſitions, were handled in the countries of each of them. Thoſe who expected a prouiſion againſt the abuſe of penſions, ſeeing what was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the 13. Article, did iudge that the matter would paſſe to a greater cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption as the euent alſo hath ſhewed. The fourteenth Article was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by euery one, becauſe it did ſeeme to take away the <hi>Annates,</hi> and paying for <hi>Bulls,</hi> diſpatched at <hi>Rome,</hi> for collation of Benefices. But in progreſſe of time, it appearing that thoſe remained ſtill, and that there was not ſo much as any cogitation either to remooue or moderate them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that, onely the ſmall abuſes of other Churches being prouided againſt, the ſaying was verified, that onely moates were taken out of the eyes, and beames neuer. Euery wiſe man thought that this age was not worthy of that Decree for the vnitie, or, at the moſt, dualtie of Benefices, and that it would not be obſerued but in the poorer ſort onely. Likewiſe for the examination in concurrence, in the collation of Benefices, euery one did prognoſticate that it would bee deluded by ſome ſiniſter interpretation. And the prophecie was quickly verified. For in <hi>Rome,</hi> within a ſhort time, they began to declare, that concurrence was not to bee obſerued in caſe of reſignation, but that hee onely was to bee examined, to whom the reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was made; which was as much as to aboliſh the Decree for the moſt part, becauſe the better ſort were excluded by reſignation, and hee onely preferred who pleaſed the reſignant: and Benefices are not vacant for any other cauſe but caſually. The Decree of the cognition of cauſes in the firſt inſtance was quite deſtroyed, by the exception added, that is, except thoſe which the Pope will commit, and call to himſelfe. For cauſes were neuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the lawfull tribunals, but by commiſſions, and auocations of Popes; and now the cauſe of the diſeaſe was preſerued, and the <hi>ſymptom</hi> onely cured. And howſoeuer the adiunct (for vrgent and reaſonable cauſes) did ſeeme to moderate the matter wel, yet men of vnderſtanding knew that it was as much as to ſay, for any arbitrary cauſe.</p>

               <pb n="793" facs="tcp:17208:406"/>
But in the laſt poynt, which was in expectation ſo many moneths, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the eſſentiall liberty of the Councell, ſeeing it was declared, that the meaning of the Synod was, not to change the manner of proceeding, nor to make any addition, or diminution of the old conſtitutions, wiſe men ſaid, that concerning this Councell it was a declaration contrary to the fact, and publiſhed when it did no good: neither was there any more vſe of it, then of a medicine applyed to a dead body. And ſome mocked, and ſaid, that it was as much as the conſolation of an honeſt man, whoſe wife had brought him children by other men, and ſaid ſhe did it not to doe him wrong. But, by an example giuen to poſteritie, it did teach how all violence, and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancie might bee vſed in Councell, from the beginning to the end, and all inconuenience done excuſed by ſuch a declaration, yea iuſtified, and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for lawfull.</p>
            <p>At this time, beſides the aduice of the Seſſion helde, three other ſorts of diſtaſtfull newes came into <hi>France.</hi> The firſt was the Popes anſwere about the hundred thouſand crownes. The ſecond, the proteſtation made in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and the diſpleaſure taken at it, in <hi>Trent,</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi> The laſt, was the ſentence againſt the French Biſhops, and the citation of the Queene of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre:</hi> The French-men, hauing much conſidered on theſe things, reſolued <note place="margin">The Alienati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in <hi>France.</hi>
               </note> not to treate any more with the Pope for his fauour in the alienation, but to execute the Kings Edict, approued in Parliament, without any conſent of his Holineſſe. This being ſuddenly performed, few buyers could bee found, as well becauſe men doe not eaſily reſolue to lay downe their money, as becauſe they were diſſwaded by the Eccleſiaſtiques, who told them, that the ſale, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Popes confirmation, would not hereafter be eſteemed to bee good. This was a hinderance to the King, and no fauour to the Clergie. For the ſale was made, but it was done at a low rate; neither was there rayſed more then two millions and halfe of Francks, ſmall, in regard of the things aliened, ſeeing that it was made at twelue for an hundred, whereas it had beene a ſmall price if they had giuen an hundred for foure. And it is worthy to bee repeated heere, that, amongſt the things ſolde, one was, the iuriſdiction which the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lions</hi> had held vntill that time, ouer that citie, which was ſold at the outcry for thirty thouſand Francks. But the Biſhop complained ſo much that, in ſupplement of the price, he had giuen vnto him 400. crownes yeerely.</p>
            <p>Concerning the proteſtation made in Councell, the King wrote to his Ambaſſadors the ninth of Nouember, that, hauing ſeene what the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> had written againſt their proteſtation, and heard the relation made by the Biſhop of <hi>Orlience</hi> of all things done in <hi>Trent,</hi> he was pleaſed with it, as alſo with their retire to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enice,</hi> and commanded, that <hi>de Ferrieres</hi> ſhould not depart thence vntill he had new order, which ſhould bee when hee was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed that the Articles were ſo reformed that the rights of the King, and of the Gallican Church were not put in queſtion. And he wrote to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> that himſelfe and his Counſel knew that his Ambaſſadors had proteſted vpon great and iuſt occaſion. For as hee would continue in the vnion and obedience of the Church, ſo hee would preſerue inuiolable the rights of his crowne, without ſuffering them to be queſtioned, or diſputed, or
<pb n="794" facs="tcp:17208:407"/>
himſelfe forced to ſhew them. That they ſhould not thinke to ſatisfie him, with ſaying in the ende, <hi>Sauing and reſeruing the rights, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe, vnder this colour, they would binde him to ſhew a reaſon in euery oppoſition. That if hee had ſeene the Articles as they were propoſed, hee would haue iudged, that the Ambaſſadour could not haue done otherwiſe then make the oppoſition: which his deſire was they ſhould firſt haue ſhewed to him, but ſaid they were to bee excuſed, in regard of the occaſion ſuddenly ariſing, and of the circumſtances which did produce it, and of the ſuſpitions, which made them doubt of ſome Artifice to precipitate the deciſion. And if the Pope had no intention, as hee, the Cardinall, giueth him to vnderſtand, that the rights of the Emperour, and Kings ſhould bee touched, and diſputed, his Holineſſe muſt turne his anger vpon the Legats, who propoſed the Articles, and named Kings, Emperour &amp; Republikes, and not vpon the Ambaſſadors. That hee thinketh the proteſtation may be iuſtified before all Chriſtendome, when the Articles ſhal be ſeene. That, the Legats hauing propoſed thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles againſt the intention of his Holineſſe, he ought not to referre himſelfe to their diſcretion hereafter, nor to cauſe his Ambaſſadors to returne, vntill he had ful aſſurance that thoſe Articles ſhould not be ſpoken of any more, which being done, he will command them to goe againe to the Councell.</p>
            <p>Concerning the citation and ſentence, the King gaue order to <hi>Henry Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The French King taketh part with the Queene of <hi>Nauarre.</hi>
               </note> Lord <hi>d'Oyſel,</hi> to tell the Pope, that his Maieſtie had vnderſtood, to his great diſpleaſure, that which he did not beleeue by the fame which was ſpread, vntill he had ſeene a copie of the monitories affixed in <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Queene was ſo proceeded againſt, as that hee was bound to defend her. Firſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the cauſe and danger was common to all Kings, who therefore were obliged to protect her; and the rather, becauſe ſhe was a widow, and his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation was the greater, in reſpect of the neere kinred hee hath with her, by both lines, and by agnation with her huſband, who died but a little before in the warre againſt the Proteſtants, leauing his ſonnes Pupils. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee could not abandon her cauſe, following the examples of his ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and the rather, becauſe hee ought not to indure that any ſhould make warre againſt his neighbours vnder colour of religon; adding, that it was not pious, to put the Kingdomes of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> lately ioyned in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in danger of a bloody warre, for this cauſe. He ſaid moreouer, that the Queene, hauing many Fees in <hi>France,</hi> ſhee could not, by the rights and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of that Kingdom, be compelled to appeare, either in perſon, or by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, adding many examples of Princes and Popes, who haue proceeded with due and lawfull moderation. Hee touched the forme of the citation by Edict, a thing not heard of in former times, inuented by <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth, and, as too hard and vniuſt, moderated by <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth, in the Councell of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ienna.</hi> He ſaid that ſuch citations could, by no meanes, take place, but againſt the inhabitants to whom the acceſſe is not ſecure, and that, the Queene remayning in <hi>France,</hi> a great iniurie was done to him and the Kingdome, by vſing that forme; as alſo was done by expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to prey, and granting to the Vſurpers, the Fees ſhe holdeth in <hi>France,</hi> the right whereof belongeth to him. And euery one marueiled (hee ſaid) that his Holineſſe who did fauour ſo affectionately the cauſe of King <hi>Antonie</hi>

while he liued, in being his mediator with the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> would now op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his children, and widow. But he complained moſt of all, that ſo many Kings, Princes, and cities hauing departed from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with in fourtie yeeres, hee had not ſo proceeded with any other, which ſhewed well that he did it not for the good of her ſoule, but for other ends. Hee wiſhed his Hol. to conſider, that power was giuen to Popes for ſaluation of ſoules, not to depriue Princes of their States, nor to order any thing in earthly poſſeſſions, which hauing beene formerly attempted by them in <hi>Germanie,</hi> did much trouble the publike quiet. Hee intreated the Pope, to reuoke all his Actes againſt the Queene, proteſting, that, in caſe hee would not, hee would proceede to thoſe remedies which his predeceſſours haue vſed. Hee complained alſo of the cauſe of the Biſhops, and commanded his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, <note place="margin">And with the Biſhops.</note> that, declaring vnto him the ancient examples, the liberties and immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the French Church, and the authoritie of the Kings in cauſes Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall, he ſhould pray the Pope not to make any innouation. <hi>Monſieur d' Oi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> performed this office with great vehemencie, and, after many treaties with the Pope, obtained of him to ſpeake no more either of the Queene, or of the Biſhops.</p>

               <hi>Loraine</hi> began to publiſh their deſeigne, that the Councel might bee finiſhed with one Seſſion more. Hee ſayd hee could not bee in <hi>Trent</hi> at Chriſtmas; that himſelfe, and all the French Biſhops muſt depart before that time; that hee deſired to ſee the Councel ended, and was loath to leaue ſo honourable an aſſembly; but that hee could not otherwiſe doe, beeing commanded by the King. The Imperialiſts alſo did publiſh in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, that the Emperour did deſire the diſpatch, and that the King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes did write, that his deſire was it ſhould bee finiſhed by Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> day, or, at the longeſt, in the beginning of the next moneth by all meanes. And indeede that King, not to pleaſe the Pope, but becauſe it was his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did ſollicite the concluſion. For beeing to hold a Diet, hee was not willing his Father ſhould haue Ambaſſadours in the Councell; and ſaid, that if that were ſhut vp, the affaires of Religion in <hi>Germanie</hi> would bee in farre better caſe.</p>
            <p>The greater part of the Fathers were glad to heare this; and <hi>Morone</hi> making a Congregation in his houſe, the fifteenth of Nouember, of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, two Cardinals, and fiue and twenty Biſhops, the principall of euery Nation, hee propoſed,, that the Councell, hauing beene aſſembled for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of <hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and now the Emperour, King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> and all Princes deſiring that it ſhould bee fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, they would ſpeake their opinion concerning the concluding of it, and the manner. <hi>Loraine</hi> ſayd, it was neceſſary to finiſh it, not to hold Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom in ſuſpence any longer, to ſhew the Catholikes what they ought to beleeue, and to take away the <hi>Interim</hi> of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which could not be done by any other meanes, becauſe it was to continue vntill the end of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; and to continue it longer, could not bee without great dammage of
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:17208:408"/>
the Catholique Church. And that it was needefull to finiſh the generall Councell in <hi>Trent,</hi> to hinder a Nationall in <hi>France.</hi> For the manner hee ſayd it might bee ended with one Seſſion, handling in it the reſidue of the reformation, and diſpatching the <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> and the <hi>Index</hi> of the bookes prohibited, which were in order already, referring other matters to the Pope, not diſputing the Articles of <hi>Indulgences</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> nor anathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing particular heretiques, but proceeding with generall termes only. They all agreed, in ſome ſort, to finiſh the Councell, except the Archbiſhop of <hi>Granata,</hi> who referred himſelfe to the Ambaſſadour of his King. Some ſaid it could not abſolutely bee ended, becauſe ſo many matters did remaine to bee handled: but that it might bee done by intimating another ten yeeres after, which alſo would ſerue to hinder the calling of Nationall Councels, and to deferre the determination of the things remayning, and the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiſmes.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Breſcia</hi> propoſed a middle courſe betweene an abſolute ende and a ſuſpenſion; becauſe the former would make the heretiques deſperate, and the latter not ſatisfie the Catholiques. But theſe opinions had no followers, all the others adhering to that which the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall had ſayd.</p>
            <p>For the manner, <hi>Otranto</hi> thought it neceſſary to anathematize the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, becauſe it hath been vſed in all Councels, and is the principall thing which is required of Synods. For many are not capable to vnderſtand the trueth or falſhood of opinions, by their owne iudgment, but doe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low or abhorre them according to the credit or diſcredite of the authours. He ſayd that the Councel of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> full of learned men, to cleere them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues whether <hi>Theodoret,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ciros,</hi> were a Catholique or not, would not heare an account of his faith, which hee deſired to render, but onely wiſhed him to denounce a plaine <hi>anathema</hi> againſt <hi>Neſtorius;</hi> that if <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> dead, and their followers aliue, were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathematized, it might bee ſayd, that the Councell had laboured in vaine. The Cardinall replyed, that diuers times did require diuers counſels; that the differences in Religion were then betweene the Biſhops and the Prieſts; that the people were but as an acceſſory; that the <hi>Grandees</hi> either did not meddle, or if they did adhere to any hereſie, they did not make themſelues Heads, and leaders. But now all was quite contrary; becauſe the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Miniſters, and Preachers could not bee ſayd to bee heads of the Sectes, but the Princes rather, to whoſe intereſts their Miniſters and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers doe accomodate themſelues. Hee that would name the true Heads of heretiques, muſt name the Queene of <hi>England,</hi> the Queene of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the <hi>Elector Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhene,</hi> the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> and many other Dukes and Princes of <hi>Germanie.</hi> Hee ſayd, that this would make them vnite, and ſhew they were ſenſible of it; and that the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius</hi> onely would ſo prouoke them, that ſome great confuſion would certainely ariſe. Therefore to doe, not what they would, but what they could, hee thought that the more vniuerſall reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was the better.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Morone</hi> ſent to call the Eccleſiaſticall Ambaſſadours: to whom hauing imparted the propoſition and opinion of that aſſembly, they conſented to

the end and the manner, according to the opinion of <hi>Loraine.</hi> Which reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being alſo communicated to the ſecular Ambaſſadors, they did all aſſent, except the Spaniard, who ſayd, hee knew not the expreſſe will of his King, and deſired time that he might vnderſtand it. Notwithſtanding this, the Legates, reſolute to execute this determination, gaue the matter concerning Princes, omitting the <hi>Anathematiſmes,</hi> and all the particular Articles, onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the old Canons of the Eccleſiaſticall liberty and iuriſdiction, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Princes with much reuerence, onely exhorting them to cauſe their miniſters not to violate them. The ſame day at night a Congregation was made, to beginne to ſpeake of the reformation, and an order was ſet downe, that there ſhould bee two Congregations a day, vntill all the voyces were giuen.</p>
            <p>Which were deliuered with great ſhortneſſe &amp; reſolution except by ſome <note place="margin">A difficulty about ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the <hi>Chapters</hi> in <hi>Spaine</hi> to the Biſhops.</note> few Spaniards, who deſired to hinder, whereas all the others did endeauour to promote the expedition, with breuity. The greateſt difficultie was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſixth Article, of the ſubiection of <hi>Chapters</hi> to Biſhops, in regard of the great intereſt, which not onely the Biſhops, but the King alſo had in diminiſhing the <hi>Capitular</hi> authoritie, that they might not oppoſe the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which are often impoſed in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and, on the other ſide, for the fauours the Legates did the <hi>Chapters,</hi> by whoſe meanes, and for the reaſons alleadged, many Italians, who firſt ſeemed to fauour the Biſhops, turned on the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> ſide. The Count of <hi>Luna</hi> ſent a Currier to <hi>Rome,</hi> in diligence, by whoſe aduice <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>argas,</hi> the Ambaſſadour, entreated the Pope for his fauour to the Biſhops. Who, according to his cuſtome, referring himſelfe to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, the Ambaſſadour complained that the Italian Prelates had beene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to change their opinion in that matter. Whereunto the Pope rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily anſwered, that they changed, becauſe they were free, but that the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Agent for the <hi>Chapters</hi> from the Councell was not free, hauing beene driuen from thence, and, vpon that occaſion, complained, that the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> in <hi>Trent,</hi> did diſſwade the finiſhing of the Councel. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he wrote, according to the Ambaſſadours requeſt, but in ſuch termes, as did not disfauour the pretenſions of the <hi>Chapters.</hi> And finally the Decree was made, with ſome enlargement of the Epiſcopall authoritie in <hi>Spaine,</hi> but not ſo much as they deſired.</p>
            <p>The Venetian Ambaſſadours made inſtance, that, in the Article of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronages, thoſe of the Emperour and Kings being excepted, thoſe of their Republique might bee excepted alſo. The Legates were willing to pleaſe them, but could hardly tell how. For to except all Republiques was too much, and to name them particularly would breed matter of iealouſie. They found a temper, to comprehend that in the number of Kings, declaring that amongſt thoſe are contained the poſſeſſors of Kingdomes, though they haue not the name.</p>
            <p>In the Congregation of the twentieth day, a propoſition was made, to <note place="margin">The Popes confirmation is demanded.</note> demand the Popes confirmation of all the Decrees of the Councell, as well vnder <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iulius,</hi> as vnder his Holineſſe. The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata</hi> oppoſed; ſaying, that in the ſixteenth and laſt Seſſion vnder <hi>Iulius,</hi> when the Councel was ſuſpended, it was ordained that all the Decrees made
<pb n="798" facs="tcp:17208:409"/>
by the Synode vntill then ſhould be obſerued, without ſaying that there was any neede of confirmation, ſo that to demaund it now would bee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thoſe Fathers, who then thought that the Decrees might bee execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without any confirmation at all. Hee profeſſed hee did not ſay this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he diſliked the demand of a confirmation, but that meanes might bee found to vſe words not preiudiciall. <hi>Otranto</hi> anſwered, that the Decree, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Granata,</hi> did not onely not fauour the oppoſition which hee drew from it, but did reſolue it rather, ſhewing plainely, that the Councell did not thinke the ordinations obligatory, becauſe it did not command, but ſimply exhort that they ſhould bee receiued and obſerued, whereof no other cauſe could bee alleadged, but the want of confirmation. <hi>Granata</hi> was quiet, and reſolued to demand the confirmation, as it was propoſed by the common conſent. But in the manner there was ſome difference. Some were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the Councel ſhould demand confirmation, and diſſolue without expecting anſwere; ſaying it could not otherwiſe bee done with dignity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Apoſtolique Sea, or of the Councel, and that it would ſeeme to bee an accord made betweene them; and if any thing ſhould not bee confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the prouiſion muſt bee made by the ſame Councel. To ſatisfie theſe, who were many, <hi>Morone</hi> was willing, that, in the Seſsion of the ninth, which, in regard of the multiplicity of the matters, was thought would continue three dayes, the firſt day a Currier ſhould bee diſpatched to demand the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, at whoſe returne another Seſsion ſhould bee held without any action, but to diſſolue the Synod. But this opinion had much contradiction. For if the Pope would confirme the Decrees without examining them, the ſame difficulty did returne; if with examination, the time of ſome moneths was neceſſary. Finally, the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine</hi> told the Fathers, that theſe difficulties were to prolong the Councel; that himſelfe and the other French men muſt needes depart, being ſo commanded by the King, and that after their departure the Councel could not bee called Generall, there wanting a Nation, whereby the dignitie and honour of it would bee diminiſhed, and Nationall Synods and other difficulties might bee raiſed. This halfe prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, with the perſwaſions of the Imperialiſts for the expedition, was cauſe (after many conſultations) of a reſolution, to demand the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diſſolue the Synod in the ſame Seſſion.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Loraine</hi> wrote preſently to <hi>de Ferrieres,</hi> who was at <hi>Venice,</hi> that the matter concerning Princes beeing accommodated, hee might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>Trent.</hi> Who anſwered hee could not, without particular commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">
                  <hi>De Ferrieres</hi> refuſeth to returne to <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> out of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe the King in his letters of the ninth, had written to him, as alſo to him the Cardinall, that when the Decree was made, and himſelfe aduiſed thereof, hee would ſend him backe; ſo that it was neceſſary to expect the order of his Maieſtie. But hee wrote to the King, that hee thought it not fit for his ſeruice to returne, in regard that the rights of the Crowne, and the liberty of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church were violated in other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees alſo, publiſhed in that Seſſion.</p>
            <p>The reformation ſtanding in good termes, the care of compoſing the Decree of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> inuocation, worſhip, reliques, and images of Saints was committed to the Cardinall of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armia,</hi> and eight Prelates; who, thought
<pb n="799" facs="tcp:17208:409"/>
they all reſolued not to mooue any difficulties, yet they did not agree. Some were willing to make mention of the place of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and of the fire, as was done in the Councell of <hi>Florence.</hi> Others ſaid, that this being hard to doe, and impoſſible to find words to expreſſe it, which might giue ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all, it was better to ſay onely that the good workes of the faithfull did helpe the dead for the remiſſion of their ſinnes. The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lanciano</hi> ſaid, that, in handling the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> mention was made, that that ſacrifice is <note place="margin">The manner of the Decree concerning Purgatory.</note> offered for thoſe that are deceaſed in CHRIST, not intirely purged; by which words the doctrine of <hi>Purgatorie</hi> was ſufficiently defined: ſo that nothing remained to bee done, but to enioyne the Biſhops to cauſe it to bee preached, and to take way the abuſes, taking care alſo that there bee no want of due prayers for the dead. And ſo the Decree was made.</p>
            <p>In matter of the Saints they eaſily agreed to condemne, particularly, all <note place="margin">Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Images.</note> the opinions, contrary to the vſes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Onely about Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges there was ſome difference. The Arch-biſhop ſaid, no honour was due vnto them, but by relation to the thing ſignified. But <hi>Lainez,</hi> the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, who alſo was one of the compoſers, added, that, when they were dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and put in place of adoration, a worſhip did belong vnto them, beſides the adoration due vnto the Saint worſhipped in them, calling this adoration <hi>Relatiue,</hi> and the other <hi>Obiectiue.</hi> He prooued his opinion, becauſe the veſſels and veſtments conſecrated deſerue a reuerence belonging vnto them, by vertue of the conſecration, though they doe not repreſent any Saint; and ſo an adoration is due vnto the Image dedicated by vertue of the dedication, beſides the reaſon of the repreſentation. The Cardinall of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armia,</hi> for ſatisfaction of both, concluded, that the opinion of the Arch-biſhop ought to be expreſſed, as more facile, and plaine, but without words which might preiudice the other.</p>
            <p>Deputies were appointed alſo to reuiew the reformation of Friars and Nunnes, beſides thoſe Prelates who had compoſed it, and the Generals of the Orders were added vnto them. Theſe changed nothing, but that it being generally granted, in the third Article, to all Monaſteries of <hi>Regular Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants</hi> to poſſeſſe immooueable goods, though it bee contrary to their inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Friar <hi>Francis Zamotra,</hi> Generall of the <hi>Minor Obſeruants,</hi> deſired that his Order might be excepted; ſaying, hee meant to liue according to the rule of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> from which in was not fit to exempt thoſe who did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundit. And ſatisfaction was giuen him by excepting his Order: as alſo the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> at the inſtance of Friar <hi>Thomaſodi Caſtello,</hi> their <hi>Generall. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Lainez</hi> deſired alſo the exception of the company of <hi>Ieſu;</hi> ſaying, that, howſoeuer the Colledges deputed to entertaine ſchollars, who were not yet <hi>religious,</hi> might enioy mooueable goods, yet the houſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But he returned the next day, deſiring the exception might bee remooued, and ſaid, that his ſocietie would alwayes preſerue themſelues in pure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>citie, in the houſes profeſſed, but did not care to haue this honour with the world, <note place="margin">The <hi>Ieſuites</hi> proteſte to line with beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, but will not be bound vnto it.</note> thinking their deſert in the ſight of God to bee ſufficient; which would bee the greater, if, being able to make vſe of the power giuen them by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:17208:410"/>
they ſhould forbeare to doe it. This reſolution was made by conſent of all the foure <hi>Ieſuites</hi> in the Councell, propoſed by Father <hi>Torres,</hi> who ſaid, they ſhould, by this meanes, haue libertie to vſe or not to vſe the grant of the Councell, according to opportunitie.</p>
            <p>In the fifteenth Article it was conſtituted, that none ſhould profeſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the age of eighteene compleate, and that euery one ſhould bee a <hi>Nouice</hi> two yeeres at the leaſt, at what age ſoeuer he entred. The <hi>Generals</hi> oppoſed; ſaying, it was not iuſt to hinder any from entring into Religion, who was capable to know what the Regular vowes did import; which capacitie was iudged by the Church to bee at the age of ſixteene yeeres, in a time when the world was not ſo well awake, and therefore that it was fit rather to make the age leſſe then greater: which reaſon they vſed alſo againſt the two yeeres of the <hi>Nouiceſhip.</hi> In the end, becauſe they were willing to pleaſe all, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſatisfie the <hi>Generals</hi> alſo, and to make no innouation herein.</p>
            <p>Beſides the twentie two Articles, there was another, in which power was giuen to the <hi>Prouincials, Generals,</hi> and Heads of the Orders to expell the incorrigible out of the Order, and to depriue them of the habite. Which <hi>Iohannes Antonius Fachinnettus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicaſtro,</hi> oppoſed ſharpely; ſaying, that the profeſſion and Act of admiſſion to it are a mutuall contract, and, as it were, a marriage, by which the profeſſed is bound to the Monaſtery, and the Monaſtery to him, and as the one could not depart, ſo the other could not put him away, and that, by meanes of this Decree, all Cities would bee filled with expelled Friars, to the great ſcandall of the world. The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Roſano</hi> ſaid to the contrary, that the relation was not as betweene man and wife, but as betweene father and ſonne, and that the ſonne could neuer lawfully refuſe the father, but the father might emancipate his ſonne, eſpecially if hee were diſobedient, and that it was a leſſe euill to ſee expelled Friars in the Cities, then incorrigible in the Monaſteries. The Generals were not all of one opinion. The perpetuall did approoue the expulſion, but the temporary did not. The maior part inclined, (according to the cuſtome of a multitude, when it conſulteth) to leaue things in the ſtate they were, and not to decree either for the one ſide or the other. But, in this conſultation, it was often repeated, and by many, that the people did receiue great ſcandal to ſee ſome weare a religious habit many yeeres, and afterwards become ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. This brought the ſecret profeſſion into queſtion, and made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation to begin, whether they ought to declare it to bee of force, as it had beene vntill that time, or that no profeſſion doth bind, but that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe. But this had difficulties alſo; for temper whereof, this reſolution was taken, that the religious Prelat, the yeere of probation being ended, ſhould be bound either to giue the Nouice leaue to depart, or admit him to the profeſſion. And this was inſerted in the ſixteenth Article, as in a place conuenient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Generall Laynez</hi> commended the Decree very much, as neceſſary; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that his ſocietie might bee excepted, alleadging, that the condition of it was different from that of other regular Orders, that in thoſe tacite profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath place, by ancient cuſtome, and approbation of the Apoſtolique <hi>Sea,</hi> which in their ſociety is prohibited; that the cauſe of ſcandall which the
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:17208:410"/>
people receiueth in ſeeing ſome in a ſecular habite, who haue long worne the religious, doth ceaſe in them, in regard the habit of the <hi>Ieſuits</hi> doth not differ from the ſecular; that their ſociety hath alſo a confirmation from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolique <hi>Sea,</hi> that the Superiour may admit to the profeſſion after a long time; which hath neuer beene made to any Regular. All inclined to fauour him with this exception; for extention whereof hee contended, that the Rules of ſpeaking <hi>Latine</hi> did require that the expreſſion ſhould bee in the plurall, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that by theſe things the Synod doth not intend to alter the inſtitution of the Ieſuits, &amp;c. And it was not conſidered that this manner of ſpeech might bee referred both to the admitting or diſmiſſing of <hi>Nouices</hi> in the end of the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Laymez</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vſe of the negligence of the Fathers in <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> yeere of Probation, and to the whole Contents of the ſixteenth Article; as alſo that it might be referred to all the things contained in the ſixteen heads. But the Father knew how to make vſe of the negligence of others, laying a foundation, on which the ſucceeding <hi>Ieſuites</hi> might build that ſingularitie which now appeareth in their Societie.</p>
            <p>The Congregation of the two and twentieth treated of Indulgences; the difficultie and length of which matter made the <hi>maior</hi> part to bee of opinion to ſpeake of it no more, in regard all were reſolued before to auoide impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But ſome deſired to handle them, ſaying, that otherwiſe the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes would ſay, that they were omitted, becauſe there was no ground to maintaine them. Others thought it ſufficient to ſpeake of their vſe onely, and to take away the abuſes which the corruption of times hath brought in. The Ambaſſadour of <hi>Portugall</hi> ſaid, hee was ſorry that prouiſion was not made for the <hi>Cruſadoes,</hi> but would bee ſilent, leſt occaſion might bee taken to prolong the Councell. The Emperours Ambaſſadours, though they did ioyntly ſollicite the Expedition, by commiſſion from their Maſter, were not of accord in this. <hi>Prague</hi> would not haue them ſpeake of the points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. <hi>Fiue-Churches</hi> ſaid, that if they were omitted, and the abuſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, Images, and Purgatorie not taken away, the Synode was quite ſhamed.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Modena</hi> tolde the Fathers, that, in caſe they would handle <hi>Indulgences,</hi> as they had done Iuſtification, conſidering all the cauſes, and reſoluing all the queſtions, they would finde it difficult, and to require a long time, it being impoſſible to make that matter plaine, but by determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning firſt whether they bee abſolutions, or compenſations onely, and ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; or whether they doe remit the penalties impoſed by the Confeſſor one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">The Councel dareth not handle the matter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences exactly.</note> or all that are due: likewiſe whether the Treaſure, which is put for their foundation, doeth onely conſiſt of the merits of CHRIST, or whether thoſe of Saints bee required alſo; whether they may be giuen, though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer performe nothing; whether they extend to the dead alſo; and other things of no leſſe difficultie. But to determine that the Church may graunt them, and hath done ſo in all times, and that they are profitable for the faithfull, who doe worthily receiue them, needeth no great diſputation. The authoritie to graunt them is prooued by the Scripture; their continuall vſe by Apoſtolicall tradition, and authoritie of Councels, and the perſpicuitie of the whole matter by the vniforme doctrine of the Schoolemen. Vpon this a Decree may be compoſed without difficultie. The opinion had many
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:17208:411"/>
followers; and hee, with other Friar Biſhops, was deputed to make a Decree in this ſenſe, adding a prouiſion againſt abuſes.</p>
            <p>In the Congregations following they handled the <hi>Index</hi> of bookes, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme, Breuiarie, Miſſals,</hi> and <hi>Agends.</hi> And all things, determined in the particular congregations of the Prelates, deputed for theſe matters ſince the beginning of the Synod, were read. Wherein they did not all agree. Some thought that certaine Authours and Bookes were cenſured without reaſon; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Index, Catechiſme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> and ſome, that others were omitted which did more deſerue cenſure. And there was no leſſe difficultie about the Catechiſme, ſome thinking that that which was made, was not fit to be made the common for the whole Church, in which the greater part are ſimple, and ſome deſiring that more matter might be put into it. And they differed as much about the <hi>Rituall</hi> bookes, ſome deſiring an vniformitie in the whole Church, and ſome maintaining their owne. But it appearing that theſe matters could not bee decided in a whole yeere, the Legates propoled that all ſhould bee referred to the Pope. Whereunto ſome few Prelates did not conſent, and namely the Biſhop of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida</hi> made a long oration to ſhew, that if any thing were proper to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell it was the <hi>Catechiſme,</hi> it being a booke, which, after the Symbol, ought to hold the firſt place in the Church; that the <hi>Rituall</hi> bookes ought to hold the ſecond, in correcting of which there was need of an exquiſite knowledge of antiquitie, and of the cuſtomes of all countreys, which will not bee found in the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> where, though there be men of excellent wit, and of great learning, yet they want skill in this kind which is neceſſary to doe any thing commendably herein, and that this is more proper to the Councell. But the reſolution to finiſh, and the deſire to depart from <hi>Trent,</hi> cauſed him to haue but ſmall audience.</p>
            <p>The fiue and twentieth of this moneth, the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> came to the Legats, with an inſtance in writing. Hee complained that the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall matters for which the Councell was aſſembled were omitted, and the others precipitated; that they went about to finiſh the Synod without the priuitie of his King; concluding, that they ought to heare the opinions of the Diuines concerning the points of doctrine, and expect an anſwere out of <hi>Spaine</hi> for the end of the Councell. The Legats anſwered; that things were in ſuch forwardneſſe, that there was no time to expect, nor was poſſible to withholde ſo many Biſhops, who were already in order to depart. The Count replyed, that if the Councell were ended without the knowledge of his King, beſides the inſtance, he would doe ſomething elſe, as hee thought conuenient. Hereupon the Legats ſent preſently to the Pope, and the Count to the Ambaſſadour <hi>Vargas,</hi> to treat with his Holines. But <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>argas</hi> thought it ſuperfluous to ſpeake any more herein, both becauſe, at the comming of the currier, the Pope fell extreame ſicke, and becauſe hauing made the ſame inſtance a few dayes before, the Popes finall anſwere was, that he referred it <note place="margin">The Popes ſickneſſe.</note> to the Councell, the libertie whereof, ſo much deſired by his King alſo, hee would not impeach. And the Ambaſſadour ſaying, that the Councel ought to bee held open, becauſe all the world did deſire it, the Pope demanded what that world was which would haue it open; the Ambaſſadour anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Spaine</hi> would; the Pope replied, Write into <hi>Spaine,</hi> that if they buy and
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:17208:411"/>
ſtudie <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> they ſhall finde that <hi>Spaine</hi> is not the whole world. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats vſed many perſwaſions to the Count of <hi>Luna;</hi> and ſo did <hi>Loraine</hi> alſo, and the Emperours Ambaſſadours. But, not being able to preuaile, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured againſt him, the Ambaſſadours in the name of the Emperour, King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and of all <hi>Germanie,</hi> and <hi>Loraine</hi> in the name of his King, and of the Kingdome of <hi>France.</hi> The Legats, reſoluing to finiſh the Councell, according to the Popes order, howſoeuer the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour might oppoſe, were diligent in diſpatch of the matters.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were in doing, the firſt of December, a currier came from <hi>Rome</hi> late at night, with aduiſe, that the Pope was ſuddenly fallen into a dangerous infirmitie. He brought letters from Cardinal <hi>Borromeo</hi> to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, <note place="margin">Cauſeth the end of the Councell to be haſtened.</note> and Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> that they ſhould haſten the Councell as much as might be, and finiſh it without reſpect of any, to withſtand the inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences which might occurre about the election of the Pope, in caſe the Councell ſhould be open in time of vacancie. In the letters there were ſome few words written with the Popes owne hand, who did commit the ſame abſolutely, and tolde <hi>Loraine</hi> he ſhould remember his promiſe. It is certaine (to ſpeake this particular here, though out of place) that the Pope was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, in caſe he did not recouer quickly, to create eight Cardinals, and to take order that no confuſion might ariſe in the election of his ſucceſſor. The Legats and <hi>Loraine</hi> purpoſed to anticipate the time of the Seſſion, and either with the propoſitions, or without to finiſh the Councell within two dayes, that the newes of the Popes death might not firſt come. Therefore they ſent to communicate the aduice receiued, &amp; their reſolution, to the Ambaſſadors, and did negotiate with the principall Prelates. They all agreed except the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour, who ſayd hee had order from his King, that if the <hi>Sea</hi> were vacant, he ſhould not ſuffer the Pope to bee elected in Councel, but that the election ſhould be by Cardinals, ſo that there was no neede to precipitate. But <hi>Morone</hi> anſwered, hee knew for certaine, that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> who was as yet in <hi>Venice,</hi> had order from his King, to proteſt that the Kingdome would not obey any Pope, but him that ſhould <note place="margin">Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Luna.</hi>
               </note> bee elected in Councell; ſo that it was neceſſarie by all meanes to finiſh it, for auoyding of danger. The Count of <hi>Luna</hi> made a Congregation of Spaniſh Prelates in his houſe, and ſpread a fame, that hee was reſolued to proteſt and oppoſe.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, the Legates held a Congregation the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in which the Decrees of <hi>Purgatorie</hi> and of the Saints were read, as they were compoſed by the Cardinall of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>armia,</hi> and the other depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Afterward the reformation of Friars was read, and all appooued with very great breuitie, and a little contradiction. Then the Articles of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation were read. In the firſt of the manners of Biſhops, at the paſſage, where it is ſaid, that they ſhall not inrich their kinred and familie by the reuenues of the Church, it was ſaid of the reuenues of the Church, of which they are faithfull diſpencers for the Pope. The Biſhop of <hi>Sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nona</hi> did op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this point, ſaying, that the portions of the poore being diuided by ancient Canon, as alſo of the fabrique and of the Epiſcopall table, it cannot bee ſaid that biſhops, and other beneficed perſons are diſpencers, but were
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:17208:412"/>
Lords of their owne part; which if they did ſpend ill, they did ſinne and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the wrath of God, as euery other man did, who ſpendeth his goods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe; but if they were diſpencers for the poore, they ſhould bee bound to reſtitution, which cannot be ſaid. There were many diſcourſes, the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior</hi> part defending that beneficed men were Lords of the fruits, or vſufructu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, and others ſaying, as the French Ambaſſadour had done in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they haue but the vſe onely. Some defended the words of the Decree that they were diſpencers, alleadging the place in the Goſpell of the faithfull ſeruant, and the Doctrine of all the holy Fathers. But the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to finiſh the Councell, cauſed thoſe words, that is, of which they are appointed faithfull diſpencers for the poore, to be omitted, as alſo other difficulties to be paſſed ouer in ſilence.</p>
            <p>In the Article of Patronages, the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Sauoy</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> made requeſt that thoſe of the Princes might bee accepted alſo, or that all might be comprehended but thoſe of the Emperour and Kings. Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was giuen them, by accepting, beſides the Emperour, Kings, or Poſſeſſors of Kingdomes, other great and ſupreame Princes, who haue ſoueraignety in <note place="margin">A diſpute whether the Decrees made vnder <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Iulius</hi> ſhould be read.</note> their dominions. Afterwards a propoſition was made for the reading in Seſſion of all the Decrees made vnder <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iulius,</hi> to bee approoued; which <hi>Modena</hi> oppoſed, ſaying that it would bee a derogation to the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Councell of thoſe times, if it ſhould ſeeme that the things then done had need of a new confirmation of the Fathers, and would ſhew that this and that was not all one, becauſe none can confirme his owne things. Others ſayd, it was neceſſarie to doe it, for that cauſe that authoritie might not bee taken from them, ſaying, that they were not of the ſame Councell. And the ſame French-men, who before did ſo earneſtly deſire that it might be declared that the Councell was new, and not continuated with that vnder <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iulius,</hi> did now labour more then others, that all cauſe of doubting might be taken away, that all the acts from the yere 1545. vntill the ende; were not of the ſame Synode. Thus it happeneth, as in humane affaires, ſo in religion alſo, that one credulity is changed with his intereſts. Therefore now, all aiming at one marke, it was determined, ſimply to read them, and ſay no more. For ſo the vnitie of the Councell was moſt plainely declared, and all difficulty remooued which the word confirmation might bring, leauing euery one to thinke what he liſted, whether the reading of them, did couſequently import a confirmation, or a declaration of their validity, or an inference that it was one Synode which made them with that which read them.</p>
            <p>Finally a propoſition was made to anticipate the Seſſion, and to celebrate <note place="margin">The Seſſion is anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> it the next day; and, if all the actions could not then be diſpatched, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it the day following, and to diſmiſſe the Fathers, and ſubſcribe all the acts of the Councell on Sunday. The Spaniſh Biſhops oppoſed this, ſaying, that there was no neceſſity to abbreuiate the time. Notwithſtanding Card. <hi>Morone</hi> ſayd, that the Seſſion ſhould bee held. And <hi>Loraine</hi> and the Emperors Ambaſſadors renewed their perſwaſions to the Count of <hi>Luna,</hi> that he would yeeld to that which is ſo vniformely reſolued. Who in the end, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things ſpoken and replyed, was content vpon two conditions; one, that
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:17208:412"/>
a decree might be made that the Pope ſhould make prouiſion for all things that remaine; another that in the handling of Indulgences it ſhould not bee ſaid that they ought to bee giuen <hi>gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>That day therefore being come, which was Friday, the third of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, they wentto the Church with the vſuall Ceremonies, and the <hi>Maſſe</hi> was ſaid, in which <hi>Ierolamus Ragazzone,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nazianzo,</hi> made the Sermon. <note place="margin">And held the 3. December.</note> Hee ſummoned all the world to admire that moſt happie day, in which the <note place="margin">The Sermon.</note> temple of God was reſtored, and the ſhip brought into the hauen, after ſo many tempeſts, and ſtormes; and that the ioy had beene greater, if the Proteſtants would haue had their part in it, which was not the Fathers fault. He ſaid, they had choſen that citie for the councell, ſcituated in the mouth of <hi>Germanie,</hi> euen at the threſhold of their houſes, without any gard, not to giue ſuſpition of want of libertie; that the Proteſtants had beene inuited, by a Safe-conduct, expected and prayed; that, for the ſafetie of their ſoules, the Catholike faith was expounded, and the Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline reſtored. He ſhewed the abuſes taken away in holy <hi>Rites.</hi> He ſaid that if there had beene no other cauſe to call a Councell, it had beene neceſſary to doe it for the prohibition of Clandeſtine mariages. And, paſſing to the things conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for reformation, he ſhewed, from ſtep to ſtep, the publike ſeruice the Church would receiue by thoſe decrees. Hee added, that the explication of faith, with the reformation of manners, had beene handled in former Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, but not more diligently in any, that the arguments and reaſons of the heretikes had been often handled and diſcuſſed, and many times with great contention, not becauſe there was any diſcord amongſt the Fathers, which cannot bee amongſt thoſe who are of the ſame opinion, but to proceed with ſinceritie, and ſo to cleere the trueth as that more could not haue beene done if the heretikes had beene preſent. He exhorted all, that, being returned to their Dioceſſes, they would put the Decrees in execution; as alſo to thanke God firſt, and then the Pope, ſhewing what hee hath done to fauour the Councell, ſending <hi>Nuncij</hi> into the Proteſtant Countries, Legates to <hi>Trent,</hi> exciting Princes to ſend Ambaſſadours, ſparing no coſt to maintaine the Councell in libertie. He commended the Legates, as being good guides, and moderators, and, in particular, Cardinall <hi>Morone,</hi> and concluded with the commendation of the Fathers.</p>
            <p>After the ceremonies were ended the Decrees were read. In the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine <note place="margin">The Decrees.</note> of <hi>Purgatorie</hi> it was ſaid that the Catholike Church hath taught, out <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Of</hi> Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</note> of the Scripture, traditions, and in this ſame Synode, that there is Purgatorie, and that the ſoules detained in it, are aſſiſted by the ſuffrages of the faithfull, and the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſſe.</hi> Therefore it doth command Biſhops to teach ſound doctrine in this matter, and cauſe it to bee preached, without handling ſubtile queſtions before the ignorant people, not ſuffering vncertaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely things to be publiſhed; prohibiting curioſities, ſuperſtition, and vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt gaine, procuring that thoſe ſuffrages bee fully executed which are vſually made for the dead by the liuing, as alſo that the things ordained in laſt wils, or in any other manner be fully performed.</p>
            <p>In matter of the Saints, it doth command Biſhops and all others who haue <note place="margin">Of Saints.</note>
               <pb n="806" facs="tcp:17208:413"/>
the charge of teaching that they inſtruct the people, concerning the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and inuocation of them, honour of relikes, lawfull vſe of Images ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ancient doctrine of the Church, conſent of Fathers, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Councels, teaching that the Saints doe pray for men, that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to inuocate them, and to haue recourſe to their prayers and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Afterwards, all in one periode, it doeth condemne ſeuen aſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this matter. That the Saints of Heauen ought not to bee inuocated. That they doe not pray for men. That it is idolatrie to inuocate them to pray for vs, though ſingularly. That it is repugnant to the word of God, contrarie to the honour of CHRIST, and a fooliſhneſſe to pray vnto them, either with heart or voyce. That the bodies of Saints, for whoſe ſake God doeth giue vs many benefits, ought not to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. That their reliques and ſepultures ought not to bee honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And that it is in vaine to make mention of them, to obtaine aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>Concerning images, that thoſe of CHRIST, of the Virgin, and of Saints <note place="margin">Of Images.</note> ought to be kept in the Churches, and to haue due honour giuen them; not that there is any divinitie, or vertue in them, but becauſe the honour redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the thing repreſented, CHRIST and the Saints being worſhipped by the images, whoſe ſimiſitude they beare; as hath beene defined by the Councels, eſpecially in the ſecond of <hi>Nice.</hi> That for hiſtories, the myſteries of religion, expreſſed in pictures, are taught to the people, and the Articles of faith called to their mind; and not onely the Benefites of CHRIST are ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to them, but the miracles and examples of Saints are euen put before their eyes, that they may thanke God for them, and imitate them; anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing thoſe that teach or beleeue the contrarie.</p>
            <p>Afterwards it addeth; that, deſiring to take away the abuſes, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of pernicious errors, it doeth ordaine, that, if there becauſe to make an image of the Diuinity, to declare the Hiſtorical pictures of the holy Scripture, the people be taught that it is not done becauſe it can be ſeene with bodily eyes, that all ſuperſtition in inuocation of Saints, worſhip of relikes; and vſe of images be taken away, that all diſhoneſt gaine bee aboliſhed, all exceſſe auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, images not pictured, nor adorned laſciuiouſly, nor banquets made in the Feaſts of Saints, or viſitation of reliques, that no vnuſuall image be put in any Church or other place, but approoued by the Biſhop, that no new miracles be admitted, or new reliques receiued, and in caſe of any doubt or abuſe hard to be remooued, or great difficultie, the Biſhop ſhall expect the opinion of the Prouinciall Councell neither ſhall any thing new, or vnuſuall in the Church be decreed without the conſent of his Holineſſe.</p>
            <p>The Decree of the reformation of the <hi>Regulars</hi> did containe two and <note place="margin">The Decrees of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi>

No religious perſon ſhall goe to the ſeruice of any place or perſon, without leaue of his Superiour, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his Conuent, without his command. 5.

The <hi>Nunnes</hi> ſhall confeſſe and communicate, once a moneth, at the leaſt, and, beſides the ordinarie Confeſſor, one extraordinary ſhall be giuen twice or thrice a yeere, and they ſhall not keepe the Sacrament within the Monaſtery. 11.

The Abbats and Heads of the Orders ſhall viſit the <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> ſubiect vnto them, though but by <hi>Commenda,</hi> and the <hi>Commendataries</hi> ſhall be bound to execute the Ordinations; and, in thoſe, Priors and Superiours, who haue ſpirituall gouernement ſhall bee created by the Chapters, or viſiters of the Orders. 21. That the Synode doeth deſire to reſtore diſcipline in all <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> but ſeeth it is impoſsible, in regard of the ſtiffenecked and difficult age, yet they will not omit to vſe meanes, that hereafter prouiſion may bee made therein, and doe hope that his Holineſſe, as farre as hee ſhall ſee the times will comport, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that a <hi>Regular</hi> profeſſed perſon ſhall bee made gouernour of <hi>Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries</hi> commended, and thoſe that ſhall bee vacant hereafter ſhall not bee conferred but vpon <hi>Regulars;</hi> and thoſe who haue <hi>Monasteries</hi> in <hi>Commenda,</hi> and are Heads of Orders, if prouiſion bee not made within ſixe moneths of a <hi>Regular</hi> ſucceſſor, they ſhall make prouiſion, or quit the place, otherwiſe the <hi>Commendaes</hi> ſhall bee vacant.

That it ſhall bee vnderſtood that all <hi>Regulars</hi> are ſubiect to theſe Decrees, notwithſtanding any priuiledge, though by foundation; commanding Biſhops and Abbats to execute them immediatly, and praying, and commanding Princes and Magiſtrates, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them, as often as they ſhall be required.</p>
            <p>The reading of the generall reformation did preſently follow; which, <note place="margin">The generall reformation.</note> after an exhortation to Biſhops for exemplary life, modeſtie in apparell and food, and frugality, doth forbid. 1. That they ſhall giue to their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or any of their family, any part of the reuenues of the Church, except they bee poore; extending the ſame to all beneficed perſons, ſecular, or regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and alſo vnto Cardinals. 2. That the Biſhops ſhall, in the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall Councell, receiue the Decrees of this Synod of <hi>Trent,</hi> promiſe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Pope, <hi>Anathematize</hi> the hereſies condemned, and euery Biſhop promoted hereafter ſhall doe the ſame, in the firſt Synod; and all beneficed men, who are to aſſiſt in the Dioceſan Synode, ſhall doe the ſame therein. Thoſe who haue the care of Vniuerſities, and ſtudies generab, ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to make the Decrees to be receiued in them, and the Doctours to teach the Catholique faith in conformitie of them, and ſhall take a ſolemne oath

herein euery yeere. And for thoſe which are immediatly ſubiect to the Pope, his Holineſſe will haue care that they be reformed in the ſame manner by his Delegats, or as hee ſhall thinke fit. 3. That, howſoeuer the ſword of excommunication is the ſinew of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, profitable to keepe men in obedience, it is to be vſed with ſobriety and circumſpection, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing found by experience, that it is more contemned then feared, when it is denounced raſhly, for a ſmall cauſe. Therefore it ſhall not be denounced by any, but by the Biſhop for things loſt or ſtollen; who ſhall not grant it at the perſwaſion of any ſecular authority whatſoeuer, though a Magiſtrate. And in iudiciall cauſes, in which a reall or perſonall execution may bee made, they ſhall abſtaine from cenſures; and in ciuill, belonging in what manner ſoeuer, to the Eccleſiaſticall Court, they may vſe pecuniary puniſhments, or proceed by diſtraining of goods, or impriſonment of the parties themſelues, with their executors or others; and in caſe they be not able to execute really or perſonally, they may proceed to excommunication. And the ſame ſhall be obſerued in criminall cauſes. The ſecular Magiſtrate ſhall not prohibite the Eccleſiaſticall to excommunicate, or reuoke excommunication, vpon pretence that the Decree hath not beene obſerued. The perſon excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated ſhall not onely not be receiued to participate with the faithfull, but, if he perſeuere in the cenſures, he may be proceeded againſt, as ſuſpected of hereſie. 4. It doth giue power to the Biſhops, in the Dioceſan Synods, and to the Heads of the Orders, in the generall <hi>Chapters,</hi> to ordaine for their Churches that which ſhall bee for the honor of God, and benefite of them, when there ſhall be an obligation to celebrate ſo many <hi>Maſſes</hi> by teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie legacies, that they cannot bee performed, or that the almes is ſo ſmall that none can bee found to performe the charge, but with condition, that memory be alwaies made of thoſe parties deceaſed who haue left the legacies. 5. That, in the collation, or any other diſpoſition of Benefices, no deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bee made to the qualities, conditions, and charges required, or impoſed in the erection or foundation, or by any other conſtitution, otherwiſe the prouiſion ſhall bee accounted ſurreptitious. 6. When the Biſhop, not in time of viſitation, doth proceed againſt the Canons, the <hi>Chapter</hi> ſhall elect two in the beginning of euery yeere, by whoſe councell and conſent, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſhall proceed in all the acts, and the voyces of both ſhall bee as one; and in caſe they both diſſent from the Biſhop, a third ſhall bee elected by them, who ſhall determine the controuerſie; and if they cannot agree, the third man ſhall bee elected by the next Biſhop, But, in cauſes of concubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, or other more hainous, the Biſhop may receiue information alone, &amp; proceed to retention; and for the reſidue, ſhall obſerue what is ordained. The Biſhop ſhall haue the firſt ſeate in the quire, <hi>Chapter,</hi> or other publique places, and ſhall chooſe his place. The Biſhop ſhall preſide in the <hi>Chapter,</hi> except in caſes belonging to him or his which authority ſhall not bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to his vicar; and thoſe who are not of the <hi>Chapter</hi> ſhall, in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Eccleſiaſticall, be all ſubiect to the Biſhop, and where Biſhops haue more iuriſdiction then the aforeſaid, the Decree ſhall not haue place. 7. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after no <hi>regreſſe</hi> or <hi>acceſſe</hi> to any Eccleſiaſticall benefice ſhall bee granted, and thoſe which be granted already, ſhall neither bee extended nor transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
<pb n="810" facs="tcp:17208:415"/>
and herein the Cardinals ſhall be comprehended alſo. <hi>Coadiutors,</hi> with future ſucceſſion, ſhall not be made in any Eccleſiaſticall benefices whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer; and if, in Cathedrall Churches or Monaſteries, it ſhall be neceſſary to doe it, the cauſe ſhall firſt be knowen by the Pope, and the due qualities ſhall concurre. 8. All beneficed men ſhall vſe as much hoſpitality as their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenue will giue them leaue: and it doth command thoſe who haue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of Hoſpitals, vnder what title ſoeuer, to exerciſe it, as they are bound by the reuenues deputed hereunto; and if perſons of that ſort as the inſtitution doth require be not found in the place, the reuenues ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to a pious vſe as neere as can be to that, as ſhall ſeeme good to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop with two of the <hi>Chapter.</hi> And thoſe who will not giue ſatisfaction in this charge of hoſpitality may be compelled (though they be Laikes) by cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and other remedies, to performe their duety, and ſhall be bound to the reſtitution of fruits in court of conſcience, and ſuch gouernements ſhall not begiuen hereafter to any; for longer time then three yeeres. 9. The title of Patronage ſhall be ſhewed to be authenticall by foundation, or donation, or by preſentations multiplied time out of mind, or by ſome other lawfull manner. But in perſons and communities, in whom vſurpation is vſually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, the proofe ſhall be more exact, and time immemoriall ſhall not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, except preſentations of fiftie yeeres at the leſt bee authentically ſhewed, and that they haue all taken effect. Other ſorts of Patronages ſhall be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be abrogated, except thoſe of the Emperour, Kings, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of Kingdomes, and ſupreme Princes, and of generall ſtudies. The Biſhop may refuſe to admit thoſe that are preſented by the Patrons, if they be not fit; and the Patrons ſhall not meddle with the fruits, neither ſhall the right of Patronage be transferred againſt the canonicall ordinations: and the vnions of ſimple benefices to thoſe which haue right of patronage, if they haue not really taken effect, ſhall wholly ceaſe, and the benefices ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to liberty, and thoſe that haue beene made within fourtie yeeres, though they haue beene executed, ſhall be reuiewed by the Biſhops, and if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny defect be found, ſhall be made void, and likewiſe all Patronages ſhall bee reuiewed, made within fourty yeeres, for augmentation of dowrie of the Church, or for building it anew; and if they ſhall not bee found to bee for the euident vtility of the benefice, they ſhall bee reuoked, and that ſhall bee reſtored to the Patrons which is due vnto them. 10.

Money ſhall not bee receiued before hand for Eccleſiaſticall goods, in preiudice of the ſucceſſours, nor Eccleſiaſticall iuriſdictions rented out, neither ſhall the Farmours of them haue power to exerciſe them: and the farming of Eccleſiaſticall things, though confirmed by the Pope, done within thirtie yeares, for a long time, that is, for twenty nine or more yeares, ought to be iudged by the Prouinciall Synod to haue bin done with dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Church. 12.

And it exhorteth all, to whom God hath giuen wealth, to impart ſome of it to Biſhops and Prieſts, who haue poore Churches. 13. Whereas the fourth of the funerals was vſually paid, vntill within theſe forty yeeres, vnto the Epiſcopall or Pariſh Church, and was afterwards graunted to pious pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it ſhall bee reſtored to them againe. 14 It doeth forbid all Clearkes to keepe Concubines, or any ſuſpected women, at home, or abroad, which if they forbeare not to doe after admonition, they ſhall bee depriued of the third part of their Eccleſiaſticall rents, &amp; of all, after the ſecond admonition, and ſuſpended alſo from adminiſtration of the Sacraments; and, in caſe they perſeuere, they ſhall be depriued of all Benefices, and made vncapable of any other, vntill they ſhall bee diſpenſed with: and if, after they haue forſaken them, they ſhall returne, they ſhall bee excommunicated alſo, and the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe cauſes ſhall belong onely to Biſhops, ſummarily. But Clearkes, not beneficed, ſhall bee puniſhed with impriſonment, ſuſpenſion, or inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.

Benefices with cure ſhall not bee conuerted into ſimple Benefices, and in thoſe which are conuerted already, if the perpetuall Vicar hath not a conuenient roue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, it ſhall bee aſſigned to him, at the pleaſure of the Biſhop. 17. Whereas ſome Biſhops carry themſelues baſely towards the Miniſters of Kings, men of preheminence, and Barons, as well in the Church, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and not onely giue them place, with too much indignity, but ſerue them in perſon, the Synod deteſting this, and reuiuing the Canons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Decorum</hi> of Epiſcopall dignitie, doeth commaund Biſhops to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare this, and regard their Decree, both in Church and without, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring they are <hi>Paſtors;</hi> and alſo commaundeth Princes, and others, to giue them honour, and reuerence, due to fathers. 18. The Canons ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued indiſtinctly by all, and ſhall not bee diſpenced but for a cauſe, heard with maturity, and without coſt. 19. The Emperour, Kings, and Princes, who ſhall grant duell betweene Chriſtians, ſhall be excommunicated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of the dominion of the place in which the duell is committed, if they hold it from the Church; and the Combattants, and Iudges of the combat, ſhall bee excommunicated, haue their goods confiſcated, and be perpetually infamous: and if they die in the duell, they ſhall not bee buried in any ſacred place, and thoſe who giue them counſell either in <hi>iure</hi> or <hi>in facto,</hi> or perſwade them to the duell, and the lookers on ſhall bee excommunicated. 20.

ſecular Princes, hoping they will grant to the Church the reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her rights, reduce their Subiects to reuerence the Cleargie, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their officers and inferiour Magiſtrates to violate the immunitie of the Church and Eccleſiaſticall perſons, but that, together with themſelues, the Princes, they will be obedient to the conſtitutions of the Pope, and of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, determining that all conſtitutions of generall Councels, &amp; of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> in fauour of Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and libertie, ſhall bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by all: admoniſhing the Emperour, Kings, Republiques, Princes, and all, to reuerence the things that belong to Eccleſiaſticall right, and not to ſuffer them to be violated by inferiour Lords, their Magiſtrates, or Miniſters; that the Clerkes may reſide and performe their dutie, without impediment, and with edification of the people. After this a Decree was read, neuer men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <note place="margin">A Decree concerning the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Sea</hi> neuer mentioned before.</note> in any Congregation; by which the Synod doth declare, that in all the Decrees of reformation, made vnder <hi>Paul, Iulius,</hi> and <hi>Pius</hi> in the Councel, with what words or clauſes ſoeuer, it ſhall be vnderſtood, that the authoritie of the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea</hi> is excepted and preſerued.</p>
            <p>Being not able to diſpatch all, the day being farre ſpent, the reſidue was deferred vntill the next morning, according to a determination made in the <note place="margin">The Decrees of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, finiſhing the Councell, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Popes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, &amp;c.</note> generall Congregation; in which the Congregation was made before day, howſoeuer, newes was come that the Pope was better, and out of danger of death. The decrees of Indulgences, finiſhing the Councell, and demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding confirmation were read, and approued by all. After dinner, the Seſſion was held, in which the decree of Indulgence was read, containing in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. That CHRIST hath giuen authoritie of granting them to the Church, and hath vſed the ſame from all antiquitie. And therefore the Synod doeth teach, and command, that the vſe of them ought to bee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued as profitable for Chriſtian people, and approoued by Councels; and doeth anathematize thoſe that ſhall ſay, they are vnprofitable, and that the Church hath not power to graunt them. And to preſerue the ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and prouide againſt abuſes, it doeth commaund that all thoſe offices of Pardonmongers be aboliſhed, and, for the other abuſes, it doth command the Biſhops, that euery one ſhall collect all of his owne Church, and propoſe them in the Prouinciall Synod, to be referred to the Pope, who will take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therein. Concerning faſts, difference of meates, and obſeruation of feaſts, it exhorteth Biſhops to obſerue the precepts of the Roman Church; and for the <hi>Index,</hi> howſoeuer it was finiſhed, in regard the Synod hath not time to iudge of it, it doth ordaine that it ſhall be carried to the Pope, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to his cenſure; and the ſame ſhall bee done concerning the <hi>Catechiſme, Breuiaris,</hi> &amp; <hi>Miſsall.</hi> It publiſhed alſo mother decree, that, by the places aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Ambaſ. it ſhall be vnderſtood that no man is preiudiced. In the end it prayeth the Princes to vſe meanes that the decrees of the Councell be not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated by the heretickes, but receiued and obſerued by them, and by all: in which if any difficultie or neceſſirie of declaration ſhall ariſe, the Pope, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">The Decrees of the two former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations are recited.</note> thoſe whom he ſhall iudge fit, from the places where the difficultie is or calling generall Councels, or by ſome other meanes, will make prouiſion. Afterwards all the decrees of reformation made in this Councell vnder <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iulius,</hi> as well of faith as of reformation, were recited. For the laſt thing,
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:17208:416"/>
the Secretarie, going into the midſt, did interrogate, whether the Fathers were pleaſed that an end ſhould bee made of that Synod, and in the name of it, of the Legats, and Preſidents, a confirmation demaunded of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, of all things decreed vnder <hi>Paul, Iulius,</hi> and his Holineſſe. And they anſwered not one by one, but all together, <hi>Placet.</hi> Cardinall <hi>Morone,</hi> as chiefe Preſident, granted to euery one that was preſent in the Seſſion, or had aſſiſted in the Councell, a Plenary Indulgence, and bleſſed the Councell, <note place="margin">The Councel is ended.

            <p>It was an ancient cuſtome in the Orientall Churches, to handle the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Councels in a publique meeting of all, and, vpon occaſion, popular acclamations did often happen, and ſometimes tumultuous, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding did conclude in concord. And, in the end, the Biſhops, tranſported with ioy, for the vniforme determinations, did paſſe to acclamations, in praiſe of the Emperours who had aſſembled and fauoured the Councell, in commendation of the doctrine declared by the Councell, in prayers to <note place="margin">The cuſtome of Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </note> GOD for his continuall diuine aſſiſtance to the Church, for the welfare of the Emperours, and for the health and proſperitie of the Biſhops; which were not premeditated, but as the ſpirit did excite ſome Biſhop more zealous to breake out fitly into ſome one of theſe conceipts, ſo the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe did cry with him. This was imitated in <hi>Trent,</hi> yet not giuing place to the extemporary ſpirit of any, but meditating what ſhould bee propoſed, and anſwered, and repeating it out of a paper.

The Cardinall roaring, and the Fathers anſwering, A long life for his Holineſſe, and eternall felicitie for <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Iulius,</hi> were prayed for; likewiſe eternall memory for <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, and for the Kings, protectors of the Councell, long life for the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and for the Kings, Princes and Repuqligues, many thanks were giuen to the Legats and Cardinals, and long life wiſhed vnto them, life and happy returne to the Biſhops, and the faith of the holy general Synod of <hi>Trent</hi> was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as the faith of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> of the Fathers and of the Orthodoxe. An <hi>Anathema</hi> 
               <note place="margin">An excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of heretiques in generall onely.</note> was denounced againſt all Hereticks in generall, in one word onely, not ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying either ancient or moderne. The Fathers were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded, vpon paine of excommunication, to ſubſcribe the Decrees with their owne hand. The next day, being Sunday, was ſpent in this: and to doe it in order, there was, as it were, a congregation.

Biſhops, ſeuen Abbats, nine and thirty Proctours of men abſent, ſeuen Generals of Regular orders. And howſoeuer it had beene determined that the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours ſhould ſubſcribe after the Rathers, yet a contrary reſolution was then taken, for two reſpects. One was, that the French Ambaſſadour being not <note place="margin">The ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors did not ſubſcribe, for two cauſes.</note> there, if the ſubſcriptions of the others ſhould be ſeene, and not his, it might bee thought a manifeſtation, that the French-men would not receiue the

Councell. The other becauſe the Count of <hi>Luna</hi> had ſaid that hee would not ſubſcribe abſolutely, but with reſeruation, becauſe his King had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the ending of the Councell. And the Legats publiſhed, that it not being the cuſtome that the Decrees ſhould bee ſubſcribed by any that hath not a deliberatiue voice, it would bee a thing vnuſuall, if the Ambaſſadours ſhould.</p>

They had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Councell of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which, in the election, ioyned other Prelats to the Cardinals; and they were afraid that this, or ſome worſe thing might happen. And howſoeuer the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour <hi>Vargas</hi> affirmed, that the Spaniſh Ambaſſadour and Prelats in <hi>Trent</hi> had commiſſion, that the election ſhould be made by the Cardinals, yet in reſpect of their ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, theſe words did not fully aſſure them. But the Popes recouerie gaue them much ioy: which was increaſed by the concluſion of the Councell, as being now fully deliuered from great danger. And the Pope ordained a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne proceſſion to giue thankes to GOD for this great benefite. In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory he ſhewed what contentment hee had in the Councell. He ſaid hee would confirme it, adde many reformations vnto it; that hee would ſend three Legats, into <hi>Germanie, France,</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> to perſwade the execution of the Decrees, to grant things honeſt, and to eaſe them in matters of poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Law.</p>

The Court, vnderſtanding that the Pope was reſolued for the confirmation, changed their ioy into griefe; and all the officers complained of the loſſe they ſhould receiue in their offices, if that reformation were executed. And they conſidered moreouer, that thoſe Decrees being conceiued in generall termes, and without clauſes of ſubtill explication, as often as any difficultie did ariſe, the world now accuſtomed to barke againſt the Court, would make an interpretation contrary to their intereſts; which would be embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as a thing of faire ſhew, couered with the title of Reformation. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and memorials were giuen to the Pope by thoſe, who, hauing bought the offices, and foreſeeing this loſſe, demanded reſtitution: a thing which the Pope did not neglect, and thought it did deſerue a good remedie, leſt there might be a deſolation in <hi>Rome.</hi> Whereof of hauing diligently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he deputed Cardinals to conſult vpon the confirmation, and to thinke vpon ſome remedie for the complaints of the Court. Some Cardinals did aduiſe to confirme immediately the Decrees of faith, and to proceed with maturitie in the other. For ſome did deſerue much conſideration, in regard of their ſmall profit, and great confuſion they might bring, and others muſt be neceſſarily diſpenſed with, in regard of their impoſſibilitie, or great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie, at the leaſt; which could not be done with any <hi>decorum,</hi> nor without giuing much matter of diſcourſe. Beſides, it would bee neceſſary to haue
<pb n="815" facs="tcp:17208:417"/>
much conſideration that they might be ſo executed, that no man might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue loſſe or preiudice, that prouiſion not deſeruing the name of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is with the detriment of any; but by deferring, time, and the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of many would diſcouer what might bee done with common ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all, without which all reformations are turned in to deformations. The Pope therefore elected eight Cardinals to reuiew them, who after long diſcuſſion were almoſt all of opinion, that it was fit they ſhould bee mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated before the confirmation, and thought, that, being to ſuffer ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it was better to doe it in the beginning, then giuing them reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by confirming, to moderate them afterwards. It is certaine, that they who did procure the Councell, had no aime but to pull downe the Popes authority, and while the Councell did laſt, euery one did ſpeake as if it had power to giue lawes vnto him. Notwithſtanding, it muſt now appeare by nullifying or moderating ſome of thoſe Decrees, that the Pope is not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue lawes, but to giue them to Councels.</p>
            <p>The Pope being of himſelfe inclined to the confirmation, and induced alſo thereunto by the perſwaſions of <hi>Morone,</hi> and <hi>Simoneta,</hi> yet perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the querimonies of the Court, and the generall opinion of the Cardinalls, that hee might come to a reſolution, beſides thoſe aforena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, hee called the Cardinals of <hi>Bordiſsiera,</hi> and <hi>Amulius,</hi> as alſo the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall officers of the <hi>Chamber, Chancery,</hi> and <hi>Rota:</hi> to whom the matter being propoſed, the foure Cardinalls did vniformely aduiſe that the Councell ſhould bee confirmed abſolutely. Cardinall <hi>Amulius,</hi> in whoſe memorials I haue ſeene this negotiation, ſaid, that his Holineſſe by his patience, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, vertue, and with immenſe charge, and with the paines and charge of ſo many Prelates, had ſeene the end of a great and difficult enterpriſe, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble direct, and finiſh the Councell; now a greater did remaine, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty, that is, to keepe himſelfe, the Apoſtolique Sea, and all the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall order, from returning into the ſame ſtraits, danger, inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and expences; that, for theſe fourty yeeres, the world hath ſpoken of nothing but of the Councell, which the Popes could not, by any meanes, diuert, in regard of the certaine perſwaſion conceiued of the neceſſitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and of the fruit it would produce. But if, ſo ſoone as it is ended, queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be made of correcting or moderating it, or it bee left in ſuſpence for want of confirmation, it will bee a manifeſtation that prouiſion hath not beene made in <hi>Trent,</hi> for that which was neceſſary, and expected, and ſuddenly ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes of prouiſion will bee vſed, either by Nationall Councels, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other generall. And heere behold the ſame ſtraights, out of which the Church, with ſo great difficultie, hath beene deliuered by God. But approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Decrees, as a perfect reformation, and giuing them credit, and as much execution as is poſſible, many wil beleeue that nothing is wanting; and nothing is more profitable for the preſent times, then to ſpread a fame, and nouriſh it, that the Councell hath made an holy, neceſſary, and perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, not ſuffering it to be knowen that any Cardinal hath doubted that it hath not performed that for which it was called. By ſo doing, the humour of the world will be quiet by degrees, and his Holineſſe may prouide for his miniſtors and ſeruants by diſpenſations, without violating the Decrees of the
<pb n="816" facs="tcp:17208:418"/>
Councell, becauſe in them the Apoſtolike authoritie is reſerued; which may ſerue him for a buckler to denie the importunate demands of thoſe whom hee will deeme vnworthy of fauour, and, in time, things will inſenſibly, the world not obſeruing it, returne vnto the ſame ſtate. He ſaid this courſe was taken heretofore when neceſſity compelled to yeeld to theſe humors, which vſually are bred in ſubiects againſt the gouernours, that when others doe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Decrees, it was fit to maintaine them, for reputation of ſo many of his creatures, of his Legates, and of himſelfe alſo; much more ought he not to nullifie them wholly, as would bee done by euery little moderation, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, or delay of confirmation; which the world would iudge to bee a mortall wound vnto them all. Beſides, the vulgar, who doe alwayes make the worſt interpretation, will haue nothing to ſay, but that the Court and Pope will not endure a reformation.</p>
            <p>This was oppoſed by almoſt all the officers of the Court, repreſenting their loſſes and preiudices, and ſhewing how all would redound to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his Holineſſe, and of the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> and diminution of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues. Onely <hi>Hugo Buoncompagno,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Beſtice,</hi> who was Cardinall afterwards, a man much conuerſant in Court affaires, ſaid hee could not chooſe but wonder at this great feare, which he ſaw did ariſe without reaſon; that, by confirmation of the Councel, more authority was not giuen it then other generall Councels had, or then was giuen to the Decree, or Decretals, by the great number of which, and by their plaine ſpeaking againſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent manners, many more preiudices and offences might ariſe, then could do by theſe few decrees of <hi>Trent,</hi> much reſerued in the former words; that no law doth conſiſt in the tearmes, but in the meaning, not in that which the <hi>vulgar</hi> and Grammarians doe giue it, but which vſe and authority doth confirme; that Lawes haue no power but what is giuen them by him that gouerneth, and hath the care to execute them; that hee, by his expoſition, may giue them a more ample, or a more ſtrict ſence, yea and contrary to that which the words doe import, and that it would bee no more to reſtraine or moderate the Decrees of <hi>Trent</hi> now, then to ſuffer them to bee reſtrained by vſe, or by expoſition, in times conuenient. Hee concluded that hee ſaw no cauſe why there ſhould bee any difficultie about the confirmation. But hee put them in minde to withſtand preſently the inconueniences which might ariſe by the temeritie of the Doctours, who, the more ignorant they are of gouernment and publike affaires, the more they take vpon them to giue interpretation to Lawes, which doth confound authoritie; that expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſheweth that Lawes doe no hurt, nor cauſe any ſuit, but by the diuers ſenſes giuen vnto them; that by the conſtitution of <hi>Nicolas</hi> the third, vpon the rule of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> a matter full of ambiguities in it ſelfe, neuer any diſorder did ariſe, becauſe hee forbade all Gloſſators, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators to expound it; that if ſuch prouiſion bee made for the Decrees of <hi>Trent,</hi> and all men forbid to write vpon them, a great part of that which is feared will bee withſtood. But if his Holineſſe will forbid all interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, euen to the Iudges alſo, and ordaine that in all doubts they ſhall come for expoſition to the Apoſtolique <hi>Sea;</hi> no man will bee able to make vſe of the Councell in preiudice of the Court, which by vſe, and by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations,
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:17208:418"/>
may bee accommodated to that which will bee for the benefit of the Church. And as there is a Congregation which, with great fruit, doth take care of the Inquiſition, ſo his Holineſſe may appoint another for this particular of expounding the Councell, to whom all doubts ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from all parts of the world. This being done, hee ſaid hee foreſaw that, by the Decrees of the Councell, the authoritie of the apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> the rights and prerogatiues of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not onely not be dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, but increaſed and inlarged much, in caſe they know how to make vſe of theſe meanes. Thoſe that heard him were mooued by theſe reaſons; and the Pope ſaw it was neceſſarie to come to the abſolute confirmation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any modification; and being perſwaded that it would fall out as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <note place="margin">All gloſſes or interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are forbid to be made vpon the Decrees of the Councell.</note> had ſaid, he was peremptorie not to hearken to any thing that could be ſpoken againſt it, but, full of hope to collect much fruit by the paines taken for finiſhing the Councell, hee reſolued to confirme it, to reſerue the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to himſelfe, and to inſtitute a Congregation, as the Biſhop had coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled: and, hauing imparted this to the Cardinals apart, hee determined to effect it.</p>
            <p>Therefore the ſixe and twentieth of Ianuary, <hi>Morone</hi> and <hi>Simoneta</hi> hauing related in Conſiſtorie the tenor of the Decree, made in the laſt Seſſion, that the confirmation ſhould be deſired by them, they demanded that his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe would vouchſafe to confirme all that which hath beene decreed, and defined in that Councell, vnder <hi>Paul, Iulius,</hi> and his Holineſſe. The Pope, firſt cauſing the Decree to bee read, asked the opinions of all the Cardinals. They were all for the confirmation vniformely; except the Cardinals, Saint <hi>Clement,</hi> and <hi>Alexandrinus;</hi> who ſaid that too much authoritie had been giuen to Biſhops in that Councell, and that it was neceſſary to moderate it, and then to make an exception of thoſe points that did inlarge it too much, which were noted already. In the end, the Pope concluded, that it was good to confirme all without exception, and ſo hee did in words, in the conſiſtorie, confirming them, and commanding that they ſhould be receiued; and inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably obſerued by all the faithfull; and the ſame day he publiſhed a Bull, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by all the Cardinals; in which, hauing related the cauſes of calling the Councell, the progreſſe, the impediments and difficulties which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened from time to time, and his diligence in fauouring the libertie thereof, graunting them free power ouer the things reſerued to the Apoſtolike Sea, hee thanked God that it was ended with an intire conſent. Therefore, being deſired, in the name of the Synod, for confirmation, knowing the Decrees to be all Catholike, and profitable for Chriſtians, hee hath confirmed them in Conſiſtory, and doth confirme them by that writing, commanding all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lats to cauſe them to bee obſerued, and exhorting the Emperour, Kings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiques, and Princes, to aſſiſt for the obſeruation of them alſo, to fauour the Prelates, not to permit their people, but rather to prohibite them by all meanes to imbrace opinions contrary to the doctrine of that Councell; and, to auoidconfuſion, for bad all ſorts of perſons, as well Clerkes as Laiques, to make any Commentaries, Gloſſes, Annotations, or any interpretation whatſoeuer vpon them, or to make any kinde of Statute, though vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of great ſtrength, or better execution of the Decrees, but that, if any
<pb n="818" facs="tcp:17208:419"/>
obſcure place wanted interpretation or deciſion, they ſhould haue recourſe to the Apoſtolike <hi>Sea,</hi> becauſe hee did reſerue vnto himſelfe power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the difficulties or controuerſies, as alſo the Synod had alreadie decreed.</p>
            <p>This Conſiſtoriall Act of confirmation, and the Bull, were printed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the decrees; which gaue matter of ſpeech, it appearing by the tenor of them, that the Decrees had not vigor, as conſtituted by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, but as confirmed by the Pope. Whereupon it was ſaid, that one had <note place="margin">The Decrees of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cel haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from the Popes confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> heard the cauſe, and another had giuen the ſentence. Neither could it bee ſaid that the Pope had ſeene the Decrces before he confirmed them, becauſe it did appeare, by the conſiſtoriall Act, that hee had onely ſeene the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for deſiring the confirmation. They ſaid alſo, that the Decrees made vnder <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iulius</hi> were read in <hi>Trent,</hi> and that it was fit they ſhould bee confirmed by thoſe that heard them, rather then by him that did not know them. But others anſwered, that there was no neede the Pope ſhould then ſee them, becauſe nothing was done in <hi>Trent</hi> which was not firſt reſolued by him. In many conſiſtories following the Pope ſpake for the obſeruation of the Decrees of the Councell, ſaying he would obſerue them himſelfe, though hee was not bound, and gaue his word that hee would neuer derogate from them but for euident and vrgent cauſes, and with conſent of the Cardinals. He charged <hi>Morone,</hi> and <hi>Simoneta,</hi> to bee diligent in aduertiſing him, if any contrary thing were propoſed, or handled in conſiſtorie: which was but a ſmall remedie againſt the tranſgreſſions, becauſe not an hundreth part of the grants made in <hi>Rome</hi> are diſpatched in conſiſtorie. He ſent the Biſhops to their reſidence, and reſolued to make vſe of the <hi>Protonotaries,</hi> and <hi>Referenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> in gouerning the citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he was freed from great trouble, by the concluſion of the Councell, yet there were ſome remainders of it in all kingdomes, which brought new difficulties vpon him.</p>
            <p>Aduice came out of <hi>Spaine</hi> that the King was offended with the ending of <note place="margin">And are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in <hi>Spaine</hi> by the Kings authority onely.</note> the Councell, and determined to call the Biſhops and agents for the Clergie of <hi>Spaine</hi> before him, to ſet downe in what manner it might bee executed. And the aduice was not falſe. For not only all that was done in <hi>Spaine,</hi> for receiuing and executing the Decrees of the Councell that yeere, partly in the Spring, and partly in the Autumne, was by order and reſolution taken in the Kings Councell, but the King ſent alſo his Preſidents to the Synods, which were held, cauſing to bee propoſed that which pleaſed him, and was fit for his ſeruice; to the great diſtaſt of the Pope, who was angry the King ſhould take ſo much vpon him in matters Eccleſiaſticall. But hee made no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration <note place="margin">Which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Pope angry.</note> heereof to his Miniſters, purpoſing to make vſe of it in another opportunitie, deſigned by himſelfe; which ſhall bee related in due place.</p>

They ſaid, that, by the words of the firſt Article of reformation in the laſt Seſſion, where it is ſaid, that the
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:17208:419"/>
Pope hath charge of the vniuerſall Church, in <hi>Latin, Sollicitudinem Eccleſiae Vniuerſae,</hi> hee had yeelded the point which himſelfe and all the French Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had ſo long contended for, and obtained, that preiudice might not bee done to the opinion of <hi>France,</hi> of the ſuperioritie of the Councell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the Pope; that hee might haue remedied this with one little word, by making them ſay, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> had done, <hi>care of all the Churches,</hi> becauſe no man would haue denied that kind of ſpeech which S. <hi>Paul</hi> did vſe; that preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice was likewiſe done to the ſame opinion of the ſuperioritie of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in the one and twentieth Article of the laſt ſeſſion, ſauing, in all the Decrees, the authoritie of the Apoſtolique <hi>Sea:</hi> and in the laſt Decree for demanding the Popes confirmation. It was oppoſed alſo, that the King, and French Church, hauing conteſted that the Councell might bee declared to bee new, and not the old continued, the continuation was declared, that it was one Councell with that of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iulius,</hi> in the ſaid one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth Article, and in the Decree for reading the things conſtituted vnder thoſe Popes; by which all was baſely yeelded which had beene two yeeres maintained by the King. They ſayd moreouer, that the approbation of the things done vnder <hi>Iulius</hi> was diſhonourable, and preiudiciall to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation then made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond. But they reprehended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, that honourable mention hauing beene alwayes made vnder <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Iulius,</hi> of King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, together with <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, the Cardinall had not cauſed a memorie to bee made of them in the acclamations, when it was made of <hi>Charles,</hi> nor the preſent King to bee named, when the liuing Emperour was. The Cardinall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed other things, ſaying, that, with ſixe Prelates, (for hee had no more in his company) hee was not able to reſiſt the conſent of more then two hundred. But this laſt oppoſition hee knew not how to excuſe, though hee ſayd it was to preſerue the peace of the two Kingdomes. For it was replied that he might haue ſuffered others to make the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

fornication, and other offences, howbeit they are ſinnes, was not ill, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of publique vtilitie, and to auoyd greater inconueniences. They ſaid, that this power beeing naturall, and giuen to the Princes by God, could not bee taken away, or reſtrained by any power of man. They thought it alſo intolerable, to excommunicate Kings and Princes, holding it for a ſure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime in <hi>France,</hi> that the King cannot bee excommunicated, nor his officers, for execution of their offices. They added, that to depriue Princes of their States, Lords of their Fees, and to confiſcate the goods of priuate men, were all vſurpations of the temporall authoritie, becauſe that which was giuen by CHRIST to the Church, doeth not extend it ſelfe to things of this nature.</p>
            <p>Concerning Patronages, they ſaid great wrong was done to the Seculars, in diſabling their proofes, and that the whole Article was grounded vpon a falſe <hi>maxime,</hi> that all benefices are free, if the Patronage bee not prooued. For Churches haue no temporall goods but granted by the ſeculars, who can not bee preſumed to grant them ſo, as that they may bee managed and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated at the pleaſure of the Eccleſiaſtiques: by which meanes it ought to bee preſuppoſed, that euery benefice had a Patrone, from the beginning of it, except an abſolute donation, with a totall ceſſion of the patronage, can be ſhewed. And as the Common-wealth or Prince doth ſucceed him that hath no heire, ſo all benefices, the Patronage of which doeth not belong to any, ought to bee vnder the publique patronage. Some mocked that forme of ſpeech, that benefices which had Patrons were in ſeruitude and the others free, as if it were not plaine ſeruitude to bee vnder the diſpoſition of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which doth manage them contrary to the inſtitution, and foundation, whereas the ſeculars doe preſerue them. Beſides the cenſure of ſome decrees for this cauſe, they added, that others were againſt the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes and immunities of the French Church; as the reſeruation of great criminall cauſes againſt Biſhops to the cognition of the Pope alone, taking away the power of Prouinciall and Nationall Councels, which haue alwaies adiudged them in all caſes, and burthening the Biſhops, by forcing them to litigate out of the Kingdome, contrary not onely to the cuſtome of <hi>France,</hi> but to the Canons of ancient Councels alſo, which haue determined that ſuch cauſes ſhould bee iudged, and ended in their proper Countries. They ſaide it was againſt iuſtice, and the vſe of <hi>France</hi> that benefices ſhould bee clogged with <hi>Penſions</hi> and <hi>Reſeruations</hi> of Fruits, as was obliquely determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Likewiſe, that it was not tolerable, that cauſes of the firſt inſtance ſhould be taken out of the Kingdome by the Pope, becauſe it taketh away a very ancient vſe, confirmed by many conſtitutions of Kings. Neither could it bee iuſtified by the exception, of vrgent or reaſonable cauſe, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all times hauing ſhewed, that all cauſes may bee taken out of the Kingdome by this pretence. For hee that would diſpute whether the cauſe were vrgent or reaſonable, doeth enter into a double charge and difficulty, becauſe not onely the principall cauſe, but that Article alſo muſt be diſcuſſed in <hi>Rome.</hi> They did, by no meanes, approoue that the poſſeſſing of immoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables ſhould bee granted to begging Friars; and ſayd, that they hauing been receiued into <hi>France</hi> with that inſtitution, it was iuſt that they ſhould bee
<pb n="821" facs="tcp:17208:420"/>
maintained in the ſame ſtate; that this was a perperuail Artifice of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to take goods out of the hands of ſeculars, and to draw them into the Clergie, and afterwards to <hi>Rome;</hi> that the Munkes did firſt gaine credit, by pretence of the vow of pouerty, as if they aimed at no temporall thing but did all in charity, for the good of the people; afterwards, hauing gained reputation, the Court do the diſpence with them for their vow, by which meanes the Monaſteries being made rich, are giuen in <hi>Commenda,</hi> and finally all commeth to the Court. To this they added an exhortation in the twelfth article, made to all the faithfull, to giue largely to Biſhops, and Prieſts; which had beene good, in caſe they did ſerue the people as they ought, and were in need. For ſo <hi>Paul</hi> doth exhort, that hee that is inſtructed in matters of faith, ſhould giue ſome part of his goods to him that doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him. But when hee that beareth the name of a <hi>Paſtor,</hi> doth intend rather any other thing then to inſtruct the people, the exhortation is not fit; and the rather, becauſe Eccleſiaſticall goods formerly were for maintaining the poore, and redeeming ſlaues; for which cauſe not the immoueables on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but euen the very ornaments of the Church, and holy veſſels were ſold. But in theſe laſt times it is prohibited to doe it, without the Pope; which hath enriched <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Clergie exceeding much. In the <hi>Moſaicall</hi> law, God gaue the tenth to the Leuites who were the thirteenth part of the people, prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that any more ſhould be giuen vnto them; but the Clergie now, which is not the fiftieth part, hath gotten already, not a tenth onely, but a fourth part, and doth ſtill proceed and gaine, vſing alſo many Artifices therein. They ſaid that <hi>Moſes,</hi> hauing inuited the people to offer for the fabrique of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> when as much was offered as did fuffice, did forbid them, in the name of God, to offer any more; but here no end will bee found, vntill they haue gotten all, if men will continue in the <hi>lethargie.</hi> If ſome Prieſts, and religious perſons bee poore, it is becauſe others are exceſſiuely rich; and an equall diuiſion would make them all rich abundantly. But to omit theſe ſo euident conſiderations, if they did exhort the people, to aſſiſt the poore Biſhops and Prieſts in their neceſſities, it would bee tolerable; but to ſay they ſhould bee aſſiſted to maintaine their dignitie, which is their pride and luxurie, doth ſignifie nothing but that they are quite without ſhame. It is true that, in exchange, another Decree was made in the eighteenth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, infauour of the people, that diſpenſations ſhould be giuen <hi>gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe things being obiected to the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> that hee had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized them, againſt the expreſſe commandement of the King, in his letters of the twentie eighth of Auguſt before mentioned hee defended himſelfe in one word onely, that in the Congregation of the tenth of Nouember, the <note place="margin">The defence of the Card, of <hi>Loraine.</hi>
               </note> Decrees being read, to bee publiſhed in the Seſſion, the next day, the rights and authority of the French King, and priuiledges of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church were reſerued. Whereunto <hi>Monſieure le Feure</hi> replied, that himſelfe and his colleague hauing vſed all diligence to haue a copie of that Decrce, they could neuer obtaine it, and that, in humane affaires, not to appeare was as much as not to bee. Beſides, this did not ſerue to excuſe the things publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="822" facs="tcp:17208:421"/>
in the laſt Seſſion. But that which was ſaide concerning the Synode in the Councels of the King and Parlament, was nothing to that which the Biſhops and Diuines, and their ſeruants alſo, according to the French liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, did relate to euery one, vpon all occaſions, making ieſts at the diſcords, and contentions betweene the Fathers, at the practiſes and intereſts with which the matters of reformation were handled. And thoſe who were moſt familiar with the Cardinall of <hi>Loraine,</hi> ſpake moſt of all. And <note place="margin">The cenſure made by the French BB. of the Councell, after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into <hi>France.</hi> A Prouer be made in <hi>France</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Councell.</note> it paſſed in <hi>France,</hi> in manner of a <hi>Prouerbe,</hi> that the moderne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell had more authoritie then that of the Apoſtles, becauſe their owne pleaſure onely was a ſufficient ground for the Decrees, without admitting the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>But, in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Decrees of reformation were not thought conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, neither by the Proteſtants, nor by the Catholiques. The Proteſtants did examine the matter of faith onely. They ſaid, that to haue ſpoken one word incidently in handling the <hi>Maſſe,</hi> that it doth aſſiſt the dead, which <note place="margin">The cenſure of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie.</hi>
               </note> alſo may receiue diuers ſences, and, in the decree of <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> to alleadge it as a definition of the Article, was a thing not to be vſed in Councels, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this, where the matters were minced, and an Article of faith made of euery queſtion, which could be mooued in any matter. And to commend Biſhops to teach the ſound doctrine of <hi>Purgatorie,</hi> without declaring what it is, did ſhew that the Fathers had great haſt to depart from <hi>Trent.</hi> But in the matter of Saints the haſt was greater, condemning, in one breath, and in one period eleuen Articles, not declaring what condemnation it was, or whether they were condemned of hereſie, or for any other cauſe, and, after a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Images, anathematiſing thoſe that ſpeake againſt the Decrees, without letting them know which it doth comprehend vnder the <hi>Anathema,</hi> whether the immediatly precedent concerning Images, or all the others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue written. But of <hi>Iudulgences</hi> they ſpake more then all the reſt; that theſe gaue occaſion of the preſent diuiſion amongſt Chriſtians; that the Councell was principally aſſembled for theſe; that, in that matter, there is no part which is not controuerſed, and vncertaine, euen amongſt the Schoolemen themſelues; and yet the Synod hath paſſed them ouer, without cleering any doubt, or deciding any controuerſie. And concerning the remedy of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they ſpake in ſuch ambiguous termes, that it could not bee vnderſtood what they did approue or diſapproue; ſaying, they did deſire a moderation, according to the old cuſtome approued in the Church. For it is certaine, and cannot bee concealed, that, in no Chriſtian Nation of the Eaſterne Church, either in ancient or moderne times, there neuer was any vſe of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences,</hi> of any kind whatſoeuer. And in the weſt, if by ancient cuſtome, they meane that which was obſerued before <hi>Vrban</hi> the ſecond, in the yeere 1095. no proofe can bee brought of the vſe of <hi>Indulgences.</hi> If from that time vntill the yeare 1300. It will appeare, that the vſe of them hath beene very ſparing, and onely to free men from puniſhments impoſed by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor.</hi> Afterwards, from the Councell of <hi>Vienna</hi> the abuſes began, which did increaſe very much, vntill the time of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, ſo that the Councel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the reſtitution of the old cuſtome, approued in the Church, it was neceſſary to declare in what Church, and in what time. But thoſe words, that
<pb n="823" facs="tcp:17208:421"/>
the Ecleſiaſticall diſcipline is weakened by too much facilitie in graunting <hi>Indulgences,</hi> are a plaine confeſſion, that they belong not to the conſcience, not doe free men from any thing in the fight of God, but touch the externall onely, that is, the Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline. For the difference of meates and faſts, they, ſaid, that to command them was good, but that was not decided of which the world complained, that is, that they did binde the conſcience. Therefore the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> held none eſteeme of this Councell. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome few miniſters of the <hi>Auguſtan</hi> confeſſion publiſhed a proteſtation, of which but little account was made. The Catholikes did not thinke of the doctrine of Purgatorie, and of Indulgences, deſiring onely to obtaine the Communion of the Cup, mariage of Prieſts, and relaxation in the multitude of precepts <hi>De iure poſitiuo,</hi> concerning faſts, feaſts, and ſuch other things.</p>
            <p>For whoſe ſatisfaction the Emperour, and Duke of <hi>Bauaria</hi> made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror writeth to the Pope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Cup.</note> to the Pope. The Emperour wrote letters to him, dated the foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of February; ſaying, that, during the Councell, hee had laboured to obtaine the grant of the Cup, not for any priuate intereſt, or ſcruple of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience which hee had, but becauſe hee did beleeue, and doeth ſtill, that the graunt is neceſſary, to bring backe to the Church thoſe that wander; that he did then tolerate the impediments interpoſed, to treat there of with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Prelates, and Princes of the Empire, with whom hauing conferred whether it were expedient to renew the ſame requeſt, they thought fit hee ſhould moue his Holineſſe therein. Therefore, calling to mind what the Cardinals <hi>Morone</hi> and <hi>Loraine</hi> had cauſed to bee told him, which was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med alſo by the Biſhop of <hi>Lieſina</hi> his <hi>Nuncio,</hi> hee would no longer deferre to demand the grace of him, without repeating any more the weighty cauſes that did conſtraine him, deſiring him to aſſiſt the Germane Nation, to which all wiſe Catholikes doe thinke that the graunt will bee very beneficiall; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that to preſerue the remainder of Religion in <hi>Germanie,</hi> and extirpate hereſies, it will be of great moment to graunt, that Prieſts, who are ſeparated becauſe they are married, may bee reconciled, and retaine their wiues, and that hereafter where there is not a ſufficient number of Prieſts, married men of good life and fame may be admitted to the Prieſthood.

inconuenient for the <hi>Vicar</hi> of CHRIST to haue pitie vpon the others alſo. Likewiſe he prayed his Holineſſe that hee would grant, for ſome time at the leaſt, that married Prieſts may bee reconciled to the Church, keeping their wiues, and married men ordained alſo.</p>
            <p>To theſe Letters was added a Remonſtrance, or conſideration, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Diuines of <hi>Germanie;</hi> in which it was ſaid: That it was plaine, that the Scripture of the New and Old Teſtament doeth permit Prieſts to <note place="margin">A Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame Grant.</note> haue wiues, becauſe the Apoſtles, ſome few excepted, were married; neither is it found that CHRIST, after their vocation, did ſeparate their wiues from them. That in the Primitiue Church, as well Orientall, as Occidentall, the marriages of Prieſts were free, vntill the time of <hi>Caliſtus</hi> the Pope; that the ciuill Lawes did not condemne the marriage of Clerkes; that it is certaine, that ſingle life is better in the Clergie, and more to be deſired, but that, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the fragilitie of nature, and difficulty to bee continent, there are but few who doe not feele the prickes of the fleſh. Therefore <hi>Euſebius</hi> relateth, that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> did admoniſh <hi>Quintus</hi> the Biſhop, that hee ſhould conſider of the weakeneſſe of the maior part, and not lay the burthen of ſingle life vpon the brethren. And <hi>Paphnutius,</hi> in the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſaying, that the vſe of ones owne wife was chaſtitie, perſwaded the Councell not to impoſe the law of ſingle life. And the Synod of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> did not for bid the vſe of wiues, but in the time when they were to offer ſacrifice. That if euer there were cauſe to permit matrimony vnto Clerkes, it was in that age. That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt fiftie Catholike Prieſts, hardly one can bee found that is not a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fornicator. That not the Prieſts onely deſire matrimonie, but the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars alſo, that they may not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſuch beaſtly behauiour, and the Patrons of Churches will not giue the benefices but to married men. That there is great want of Miniſters onely for the prohibition of Matrimonie. That the Church hath formerly remitted the ſeueritie of the Canons for this cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. That the Pope did confirme a Biſhop in <hi>Saragoſa,</hi> who had a wife and children, and a Deacon, who had been twice married, and committed the Sacrament of Confirmation to ſimple Prieſts, in defect of a Biſhop. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many Catholiques did then, and doe now thinke better to diſpence with the law of continencie, then, by retaining it, to open a gate to vncleane ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, leauing marriage free for all; and the rather, becauſe Cardinall <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normitan</hi> doeth hold, that it would bee good for the ſaluation of ſoules to grant Matrimonie; and that there are examples of the old Church, and in the <hi>Anciran</hi> Councell, of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eupſychius Ceſarienſis,</hi> Prieſts. That it is certaine, that the Pope may diſpence with Secular Prieſts; which ſome alſo extend vnto Regulars. That it ſeemeth a great abſurditie not to admit mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Clerkes, and to tolerate fornicators and to remooue both would bee as much as to remaine without Miniſters, and that if they ought to be bound to the vow of chaſtitie, none ſhould be ordained but old men. That it is not a good reaſon to retaine ſingle life with the teeth, to preſerue Eccleſiaſticall goods, it not being iuſt, in reſpect of temporall things to make ſhipwracke of ſoules. Beſides, prouiſion might bee made herein, by ſome other meanes; which being done, concubinate would be baniſhed out of the Church, and the ſcandall which offendeth many taken away.</p>

The Pope, conſidering theſe remonſtrances, was of opinion to call to <hi>Rome</hi> pious and learned men, of all Nations, to handle this point with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, and ſpake of it to the Ambaſſadours reſiding with him. But Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Simoneta</hi> did diſſwade, ſaying, it would bee a kinde of Councell, and that if men ſhould come out of <hi>France, Spaine, Germanie,</hi> and elſewhere, they would bring intelligences and inſtructions of Princes, and would be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſpeake according to their intereſts, and that, when his Holineſſe would be quit of them, he could not doe it at his pleaſure; that, if he did not follow their opinion, it would diſtaſte the Princes; that he ſhould remember what troubles the Councel put him to, and not fall into the like dangers. The Pope thought the counſell was ſincere, and profitable, and therefore, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more of ſtrangers, he deputed nineteene Cardinals, giuing them order to examine diligently the writing that came out of <hi>Germany.</hi>

For what can wee ſay for our ſelues, if the people of God, ouer whom wee are, though vnworthily, placed, bee oppreſſed by the multitude of our offences? if our examples deſtroy that which our preaching builds, and our works giue, as it were, the lye to our doctrine? Our bones are worne with faſting, but our mindes are puft vp: Our bodies are couered with poore clothing, but in our hearts wee are as braue as may be: We lie groueling in the aſhes, but ayme at matters exceeding high: Wee are teachers of humilitie, but patternes of pride, hiding the teeth of wolues vnder a ſheepes countenance.

We know that many Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> haue been not onely heretiques, but euen the chiefe leaders of them. Out of this ſchoole proceeded <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> who, thinking it not to be poſſible that God ſhould be made man, did beleeue that IESVS CHRIST, the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betweene God and man was two perſons, and went as farre in Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as the Iewes themſelues. Thence came <hi>Macedonius,</hi> who denied the holy Ghoſt, conſubſtantiall to the Father and the Sonne, to be God.

Why ſhould we refuſe this name when it was offered, and another ſhould aſſume it without any offer at all? This man, contemning obedience to the Canons, is the rather to be humbled by the commands of our moſt pious <hi>Souereignes.</hi> He is to be chaſtiſed who doeth iniurie to the holy Catholique Church, whoſe

Wee are all ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized herein: Let the author of this ſcandall reforme himſelfe, and all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the Church will ceaſe. I am ſeruant vnto all Prieſts ſo long as they liue like themſelues, but if any ſhall vainely ſet vp his briſtles contrary to God Almighty, and to the Canons of the Fathers, I hope in God that hee ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to bring my necke vnder his yoke, no not by force of armes.

Likewiſe it is conuenient to expreſſe (as a matter belonging to this argument) what contentions haue hapned at ſeuerall times betweene the Popes and the Emperours vpon theſe and the like occaſions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> the firſt whereof was the <hi>Apoſtle Saint Peter,</hi> their authoritie beeing founded by IESVS CHRIST in things Spirituall onely, did abound with charitie, humility, patience; and many miracles were wrought by them. At the firſt they were not onely deſtitute of all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power, but were perſecuted by it; neither was their name ſo much as ſpoken of, but for the afflictions and the torments which they and their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers did endure. For howſoeuer their proceedings were ſometimes not obſerued, by reaſon of the multitude and variety of nations and profeſſions in <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſome of the Emperours did forbeare to queſtion them, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when their actions did ſeeme to croſſe the publique gouernment, yet ſome others, either becauſe they were inclined to crueltie, or for the loue they bare to their owne Gods, did bitterly perſecute them, as inuenters of new ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and enemies of true Religion.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate of life they continued, vntill the time of <hi>Silueſter</hi> the Pope, to be moſt famous for their voluntary pouerty, ſanctity of life, and martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. Afterwards, <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emperor being turned Chriſtian, moued therunto by the holineſſe of thoſe who followed CHRIST, &amp; by the miracles done by them, the Popes came to bee ſecure from thoſe dangers to which they had beene ſubiect for the ſpace of 300. yeeres before, &amp; had free exerciſe of their Chriſtian profeſſion. Hereupon, for the reuerence which the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their life and religion had procured them, and becauſe men are prone to follow the example of their Prince, by reaſon either of ambition or of feare,
<pb n="833" facs="tcp:17208:426"/>
Chriſtianity began marueilouſly to ſpread it ſelfe, and the pouerty of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians not to bee ſo great as it was. For <hi>Conſtantine</hi> hauing built the Church of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in <hi>Lateran,</hi> of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and many others in diuers places, not onely gaue them plate and ornaments, but alſo, that theſe might bee preſerued and renewed, the Churches repaired, and the Clergie belonging to them maintained, hee endowed them with poſſeſſions and with reuenues. In after times many, perſwading themſelues that they ſhould gaine heauen more eaſily by beeing liberall toward Churches, either built and indowed other Churches, or gaue to thoſe which were built be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. In like manner euery one payed them tithes due either by law or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, as in the old Teſtament is commanded. Wherein euery one was the more forward, becauſe Clergie-men in thoſe times contented themſelues with neceſſaries onely, and beſtowed the remainder either to repaire their Churches, or to adorne them, or in workes of charitie and pietie. Now the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> (pride and ambition hauing not as yet poſſeſſed their harts) were acknowledged by all Chriſtians to bee ſuperiours of all Churches, in all Spirituall gouernment, as ſucceſſours vnto the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> becauſe that Citie, by reaſon of the dignitie and greatneſſe thereof, retained the name and maieſtie of the Empire as head of all the reſt, and becauſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion was thence diffuſed into the greater part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and becauſe <hi>Conſtantine</hi> (hauing beene baptized by <hi>Silueſter)</hi> did willingly acknowledge that ſuch authority belonged to him and his ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there is a fame that <hi>Constantine,</hi> beeing conſtrained to tranſlate the ſeate of the Empire to <hi>Bizantium,</hi> now called (by his name) <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> by occaſion of ſome accidents hapning in the Weſterne Prouinces, gaue to the Popes the Lordſhips of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of many other Cities and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces in <hi>Italie.</hi> This fame, though cheriſhed by ſucceeding Popes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued by many, by reaſon of their authoritie and credit, is not onely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by more probable authors, but euen by the very things themſelues. For it is moſt manifeſt that <hi>Rome,</hi> as alſo all <hi>Italy</hi> obeyed the Emperours and their Magiſtrates, both then and many yeeres after. Some wil not beleeue any thing at all that hath been ſpoken concerning <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Silueſter,</hi> (ſuch is the obſcurity of things done ſo long agoe) affirming that they liued not at the ſame time: yet no man denieth that the tranſlation of the Empire was the firſt cauſe of the Popes authoritie. For the people of <hi>Rome</hi> withdrew their obedience from the Emperours by occaſion of their abſence, and of the difficulties which they found in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and did the rather performe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſome certaine obſequiouſneſſe to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> though indeed no abſolute ſubiection.</p>

were driuen out of <hi>Italie</hi> by the Emperours, the Countrey began againe to bee gouerned by <hi>Greeke</hi> magiſtrates, the chiefe of which, called (by a <hi>Greeke</hi> word) <hi>Exarke,</hi> kept his reſidence at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> a Citie very ancient, and then very rich, and much inhabited by reaſon of the fertility of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.

Theſe, together with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> beeing a good while after oppreſſed by the <hi>Lombards,</hi> did finally implore the ayde of <hi>Pipin</hi> King of <hi>France:</hi> who paſſing into <hi>Italie</hi> with a great armie, chaſed the <hi>Lombards</hi> from a part of their Dominion which they had enioyed more then two hundred yeeres.

               </p>
               <p>Afterwards in the yeere 800. after CHRIST, Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Popes authoritie onely as head of that people, made this <hi>Charles</hi> Emperour of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeparating this part of the Empire from thoſe Emperours which had their ſeat at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> and the Weſterne Prouinces, beeing abandoned by them, could not well ſubſiſt without a Prince of their owne. The Emperours of the Eaſt were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued by this diuiſion neither of <hi>Sicilie</hi> nor of that part of <hi>Italie</hi> which, coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting from <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Manfredonia,</hi> is bounded by the Sea, becauſe they were alwayes vnder thoſe Emperours. By this alteration the cuſtome that the Popes election ſhould be confirmed by the Emperours was not changed at all, neither did <hi>Rome</hi> ceaſe to bee gouerned by them: nay the Popes did date all their Buls, Priuiledges and Grants with theſe formall words, <hi>In the reigne of ſuch an Emperour our Lord and Maſter.</hi> In this eaſie ſubiection or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie the Popes continued vntill their owne proſperitie gaue them courage to gouerne themſelues. But the Emperours power beeing weakened by the diſcords of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great his poſteritie, and the Empire beeing transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon the <hi>German</hi> Princes, which were not ſo potent as thoſe who were before, by reaſon of the greatneſſe of the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> and of the ſucceſſors of <hi>Charles, Rome</hi> began to bee gouerned by her owne Magiſtrates, though but in a tumultuous maner; and the Popes, withdrawing themſelues from the Emperours obedience as much as they could, decreed that their election ſhould no more bee confirmed by them. This decree was diuerſly obſerued according as the Emperours power did riſe or fall.</p>
               <p>This power being become great in the <hi>Otho's</hi> of <hi>Saxonie, Otho</hi> the third made meanes to chooſe <hi>Gregorie</hi> the fift, his owne countriman, for Pope; who, for the loue hee bare to his owne nation, and for the perſecutions which were rayſed by the <hi>Romans,</hi> gaue the <hi>Germans,</hi> by his Decree, power to chooſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, in that forme as is now vſed. And (to giue ſome preheminence to the Pope) hee forbad them to vſe the title of <hi>Emperour</hi> or of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> but onely of King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> vntill they had receiued the crowne of the Empire. Hence grew the cuſtom of comming to <hi>Rome</hi> to be crowned.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Otho's</hi> the imperiall power, being not hereditarie to great Kings, was much diminiſhed. Hereupon both <hi>Rome</hi> and many Cities beſides, when <hi>Conrade</hi> of <hi>Sueuia</hi> was Emperour, did openly rebell. The Popes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aduantage to aduance their power, made themſelues Lords of the <hi>Romans,</hi> though many times they were much troubled by them. But the better to repreſſe them, they obtayned of <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond Emperour, when he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> that the <hi>Cardinals</hi> onely ſhould chooſe the Pope.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="836" facs="tcp:17208:428"/>
This their greatneſſe was increaſed by a new accident. For the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> (the firſt of which was <hi>William</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Ironarme)</hi> hauing taken <hi>Puglia</hi> and <hi>Calabria</hi> from the Empire of <hi>Conſtantinople, Robert Guicciard,</hi> one of them, eyther to fortifie himſelf by this colour, or to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the ſtronger againſt theſe Emperours, or for ſome other reaſon, firſt reſtored <hi>Beneuent</hi> to the Church, and then acknowledged that the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Puglia</hi> and <hi>Calabria</hi> were held in vaſſallage of it. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie of this example <hi>Roger,</hi> one of his ſucceſſors, hauing chaſed <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> a man of the ſame familie, out of this <hi>Dukedome,</hi> and then poſſeſſed himſelfe of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> hee acknowledged in the yeare 1130: that hee held theſe Prouinces in vaſſallage of the Church, vnder the title of King of both the <hi>Sicilies,</hi> the one beyond the other on this ſide <hi>Faros.</hi> The Popes refuſed not to cheriſh the vſurpation and violence of others, in regard it ſerued to aduance their owne ambition and profit. For they proceeded further (as the deſires of men are neuer ſatisfied) and depriued one of the Kings of theſe kingdomes for diſobeying their commands, and gaue them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. By this meanes they came to <hi>Henry</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Frederick Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa;</hi> from him to his ſonne <hi>Frederick</hi> the 2. all which three were Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceſſiuely. But <hi>Frederick</hi> being a bitter perſecuter of the Church, and the factions of <hi>Guelfs</hi> and <hi>Ghibelius</hi> being on foote, of the one of which the Pope, of the other the Emperor was <hi>head,</hi> the Pope after the death of <hi>Frederick,</hi> granted theſe kingdomes to <hi>Charles, Earle</hi> of <hi>Aniou</hi> and <hi>Prouence,</hi> of whom we ſpake before, vpon condition he ſhould pay 6000. ounces of gould yearly for tribute, and that neither hee nor any of his ſucceſſors ſhould accept of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. This condition hath beene ſpecified euer ſince in the inueſtiture of the kingdome of <hi>Naples.</hi> The kingdome of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> being uſurped by the Kings of <hi>Aragon,</hi> withdrew it ſelfe within few yeares from the obedience of the Church, both for the tribute, and for the vaſſallage.</p>
               <p>There hath beene a fame, though not ſo certaine as thoſe things which haue beene ſpoken of, that the <hi>Counteſſe Maude,</hi> a potent Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in <hi>Italie,</hi> gaue long before to the Church that part of <hi>Tuſcanie</hi> which is bounded by the torrent <hi>Peſcia,</hi> the caſtle called <hi>Saint Quirico</hi> in the countie of <hi>Siena</hi> the Sea called <hi>Mare inferum,</hi> and the riuer <hi>Tiber,</hi> now knowen by the name of the <hi>Patrimonie of Saint Peter.</hi> Some adde that ſhee gaue to the Church likewiſe the Citie of <hi>Ferrara.</hi> Theſe things are not certaine: and it is more vncertaine (which notwithſtanding is related) that <hi>Authpertus</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards</hi> then flouriſhing, gaue the Pope the <hi>Alpes</hi> called <hi>Cocciae,</hi> in which they ſay that <hi>Genua,</hi> and all the tract from thence to <hi>Prouence</hi> is contained: as alſo that <hi>Suithprandus,</hi> King of the ſame Nation, gaue him <hi>Sabina,</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey neere to <hi>Rome, Naruia, Ancona,</hi> and certaine other Lands.</p>
               <p>As theſe things did varie, ſo the affaires of the Popes and Emperours did vary alſo. At the firſt, for many ages together, the Popes were perſecuted by the Emperours: afterwards they were at quiet, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> beeing conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the faith; but ſo as that they medled with Spirituall matters onely, and were little leſſe then wholly ſubiect to the Emperours. After that they liued a long time in very meane eſtate, and had no commerce at all with
<pb n="837" facs="tcp:17208:428"/>
them, by reaſon of the great power of the <hi>Lombards</hi> in <hi>Italie.</hi> But after they had gotten temporall authority by the aſſiſtance of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> they adhered very much and very willingly to the Emperours, ſo long as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire continued in the poſteritie of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> in regard of benefites gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and taken, as alſo in regard of the greatneſſe of the Emperours. But when the Imperiall greatneſſe declined, they withdrew themſelues from the Emperours, and profeſſed that the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> ought to giue lawes to them, rather then to receiue any from them. Now becauſe they hated to come vnder the old yoke, and feared that ſome of the Emperours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the example of their moſt potent and braueſt predeceſſors, would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to recouer the rights of the Empire in <hi>Rome,</hi> they openly oppoſed them by warre, aſſiſted by ſome Tyrants who called themſelues Princes, and by ſome Cities who had ſet themſelues at libertie, and did no more acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the authority of the Empire. Hence it came to paſſe that the Popes aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming euery day more and more, they conuerted their Spirituall weapons to maintaine their temporall affaires. For making this interpretation, that, as <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars</hi> of CHRIST on earth, they were aboue the Emperors, and that in many caſes the whole care of matters terrene belonged to them, ſometimes they depoſed the Emperours, and mooued the <hi>Electors</hi> to make choyce of others in their roome, and ſometimes the Emperours choſe new Popes, or cauſed them to be choſen by others.</p>
               <p>By theſe controuerſies, and by the Popes abode ſeuenty yeeres at <hi>Auigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and by meanes of a <hi>Schiſme</hi> which happened in <hi>Italie</hi> after that the Popes were returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> it came to paſſe that in thoſe Cities which were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the <hi>Church,</hi> eſpecially in thoſe of <hi>Romania,</hi> many potent Citizens, each in his owne Countrey, attained to ſouereigne power. The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> either perſecuted them, or, not being able to ouercome them, gaue them theſe Cities, to bee held of them in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>aſſallage,</hi> or inueſted other commanders in them. So the Cities of <hi>Romania</hi> began to haue particular <hi>Lords,</hi> by the name, for the moſt part, of <hi>Vicars</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Thus <hi>Ferrara,</hi> firſt giuen by the Pope to <hi>Azo de Eſti</hi> to be gouerned by him, was afterwards granted to him vnder the title of <hi>Vicarſhip.</hi> This familie was in proceſſe of time exalted to more illuſtrious honours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bolonia</hi> being thus poſſeſſed by <hi>Iohn Viſconte</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> was after giuen him by the Pope as a <hi>

The ſame variations being alſo in <hi>Lombardie,</hi> amongſt the Cities of the Empire, it ſometimes fell out that the <hi>Vicars</hi> of <hi>Romania,</hi> and of other Eccleſiaſticall territories, withdrawing themſelues openly from the <hi>Church,</hi> acknowledged to hold thoſe Cities in <hi>Vaſsalage</hi> from the Emperours, and thoſe who poſſeſſed <hi>Milan, Mantua,</hi> and other Imperiall places, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to hold them from the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="838" facs="tcp:17208:429"/>

Hereupon the Popes, retaining but ſmall authoritie, abſented themſelues wholly from thence vntill the <hi>Romanes,</hi> beeing fallen into great pouertie and grieuous diſorders, by the abſence of the Court, and the yeere 1400. approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, in which they hoped if the Pope were at <hi>Rome,</hi> there would be a great concourſe of all Chriſtendom, by reaſon of the <hi>Iubelie,</hi> they moſt humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> to returne to them, offering to put down the office of the <hi>Banderefi,</hi> and to yeeld him abſolute obedience. Vpon theſe conditions hee returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and, while the people were intent vpon their gaine, made himſelfe abſolute <hi>Lord</hi> of the Citie, and fortified and put a garriſon in the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo.</hi> Thoſe who ſucceeded vntill Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties; but then the ſouereigntie was ſo well eſtabliſhed, that all his ſucceſſors gouerned the Citie, euen at their owne pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Being raiſed by theſe ſteps vnto earthly power, they laid a ſide by little and little the care of ſoules, and of diuine precepts: ſo that ſetting their affections wholly vpon earthly greatneſſe, and vſing their ſpirituall authoritie only as an inſtrument of their temporall, they ſeemed rather to bee ſecular Princes then Prieſts. After this their care and buſineſſe was no more ſanctitie of life, increaſe of religion, loue and charitie towards their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, but armies, and wars againſt Chriſtians, handling the ſacrifices, euen with bloudie hands; but heaping vp of wealth; but new lawes, new arts, new ſnares to ſcrape monie from all parts. For this end they vſed their ſpirituall weapons without reſpect, and ſould things both ſacred and profane, without any ſhame at all. The Popes and the Court thus abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with wealth, there followed pompe, riot, diſhoneſtie, luſt, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable pleaſures: no care of poſteritie, no thought of maintayning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall dignitie of the <hi>Papacie;</hi> but in place hereof ſucceeded ambitious and peſtiferous deſires to exalt their ſonnes, nephewes, and kindred, not onely to immoderate riches, but to Principalities and to kingdoms; beſtowing their dignities and benefices not vpon virtuous and well deſeruing men, but ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſelling them to thoſe who would giue moſt, or miſplacing them vpon ambitious, couetous, and impudently voluptuous perſons.</p>
               <p>Hauing loſt by this meanes that reſpect and reuerence which formerly the world did giue them, they did notwithſtanding maintaine in part their authoritie by the powerfull name and maieſtie of religion; and ſomewhat they were helped by the facultie which they haue in gratifiing of great Princes, and thoſe who were potent about them, by beſtowing ſome Encleſiaſticall fauours and dignities vpon them. Hence it cometh to paſſe that they are in high reſpect amongſt men; ſo that whoſoeuer taketh armes againſt them is eſteemed infamous for it, and findeth many oppoſitions by other Princes. Whatſoeuer hapneth, there is but ſmale gaine to bee made by ſtriuing with them: For thoſe that conquere them vſe the victorie as the Popes will, who being conquered obtaine what conditions they pleaſe. Now becauſe they haue a great deſire to raiſe their neereſt kinred from the ſtate of priuat men to bee great Princes, oftentimes they haue beene, for very many years laſt paſt; the occaſions and the inſtruments of rayſing now wars and tumults in <hi>Italie.</hi>

Such honor was then giuen to religion, and religion was ſo graced with miracles, and ſanctified manners, that their anceſters, without any conſtraint of armes or violence, yeelded obedience to the gouernment of Eccleſiaſtiques, and willingly ſubmitted their necks to the ſweet yoke of Chriſtian pietie. But now what neceſſitie, what virtue, what dignitie is there which can couer in any part the infamie and ſhame of this ſeruilitie? Is it integritie of life? holy examples giuen by theſe Prieſts, or any miracles done by them? what generation is there in the world more corrupt, or more defiled with brutiſh and debauched manners? It is miraculous that God, the fountaine of Iuſtice, hath ſo long indured ſuch abominable wickedneſſe. Some peraduenture may ſay that this tyrannie is ſupported by proweſſe of armes, or mens aſſiduous care and induſtrie for the preſeruation of the Papall greatneſſe. But what generation is there in the world more auerſe from the ſtudies of war, or more vnwilling to endure the labours belonging to it? more giuen ouer to idleneſſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? more negligent of the honor and profit of their ſucceſſors.</p>
               <p>The principalitie of the <hi>Soldans</hi> of great <hi>Caire</hi> is the moſt like in all the world to this of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome.</hi> For neither the dignitie of the <hi>Soldans,</hi> nor the honors of the <hi>Mammalukes</hi> are hereditarie, but, paſſing from one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie to another, doe ſometimes fall vpon ſtrangers. But the ſeruilitie of the <hi>Romans</hi> is more baſe then that of theſe <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Syrians.</hi> For the infamie of theſe is ſomwhat couered in that the <hi>Mammalukes</hi> are warlicke and valiant men, accuſtomed to labour, and wholy auerſe from pleaſures. But whom doe the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſerue? marrie idle and ſlouthfull perſons, ſtrangers, and ſuch as many times are as baſe for their deſcent as for their maners.

But, as I conceiue, <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, the preſent <hi>Pope,</hi> remèmbreth what happened heretofore to <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22; that hee came not in a very happy houre to the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Conſtance:</hi> for hee came <hi>Pope,</hi> but returned <hi>Cardinall.</hi> Therefore, ſince then, the <hi>Popes</hi> haue prouided for themſelues in the rere, and kept home, and haue withſtood all <hi>Councels,</hi>
                  <pb n="844" facs="tcp:17208:432"/>
and free diſputes. For aboue fourty yeeres ſince, when Doctor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was curſed by the <hi>Pope</hi> with <hi>Bell, Booke, and Candle,</hi> becauſe he had begun to preach the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and to reforme Religion out of GOD's word, and had humbly requeſted, that his whole cauſe might bee referred to the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of a <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> hee could haue no audience. For <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the tenth did ſee well enough, if the matter ſhould come to a <hi>Councell,</hi> that his owne ſtate might come in danger, and that hee might perchance heare what he would not willingly.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Indeede the name of a <hi>Generall Councell</hi> carries a faire ſhewe, ſo it be aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as it ought, and (affections layde aſide) all things bee referred to the rule of <hi>Gods</hi> word, and the trueth onely aymed at. But if Religion and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe bee openly beaten downe, if tyrannie and ambition bee eſtabliſhed, if men ſtudie faction, gluttonie, luſt, there is nothing more pernicious for the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> All this I haue ſpoken hitherto, as if this <hi>Councell,</hi> which you call ſo did ſubſiſt ſomwhere, and were indeed a <hi>Councell</hi> which I thinke abſolutely to be none. Or if it be one, and ſubſiſt any where, ſure it is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure one, and kept very cloſe. For though we are not very farre off, yet we can by no meanes learne, what is done there, what Biſhops haue met, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed whether any at all are met. Nay beſides, aboue twentie months ſince, when this <hi>Councell</hi> was firſt ſummoned by <hi>Pope Pius,</hi> the <hi>Emperour Ferdinand</hi> anſwered that though all other matters were accommodated, yet hee did much diſlike the <hi>Place,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> had made choice of for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For <hi>Trent,</hi> though a prety Citie, yet neither was commodiouſly enough ſeated for the receipt of ſo many <hi>Nations,</hi> nor able to receiue ſo great a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men, as were likely in reaſon to meete at a <hi>Generall Councell.</hi> The ſame anſwere was returned from other <hi>Chriſtian Princes;</hi> and from ſome, much ſharper. Therfore wee beleeued that all theſe things, together with the Councell it ſelfe, had beene vaniſhed away into ſmoake.</p>
               <p n="7">7 But I pray you, who is he that hath ſummoned this <hi>Councell,</hi> and called the world together? You wil ſay, <hi>Pope Pius</hi> the fourth. And why he, rather then the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Toledo?</hi> For by what power, by what example of the <hi>Primitiue Church,</hi> by what right doth hee this? Did <hi>Peter, Linus, Cletus, Clemens,</hi> thus toſſe and tumble the world with their Proclamations? This was alwayes whileſt the <hi>Empire</hi> flouriſhed, the proper right of the <hi>Emperours</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> But now, ſince the power of the <hi>Empire</hi> is leſſened, and <hi>Kingdomes</hi> by ſucceſſion ſhare part of the <hi>Imperiall power,</hi> that power is communicated to <hi>Chriſtian Kings</hi> and <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Search the Annals, lay together the memorials of all Antiquitie, you ſhall finde the ancienteſt <hi>Councels,</hi> the <hi>Nicene,</hi> the <hi>Epheſine,</hi> that of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to haue beene called by the <hi>Roman Emperours, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Theodoſius</hi> the firſt, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Martian,</hi> not by the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> a man otherwiſe louing enough to himſelfe, and no way neglectfull of the authority of his <hi>Sea,</hi> did humbly beſeech <hi>Mauritius</hi> the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> that hee would ſummon a <hi>Councell</hi> to be held in <hi>Italie,</hi> as beeing the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt place. <hi>All the Prieſts</hi> ſayes hee, <hi>beſeech your Clemencie, that you would command a Generall Councell to bee held within Italie.</hi> But the <hi>Emperour</hi> cauſed that <hi>Ceuncel</hi> to bee aſſembled, not in <hi>Italie,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> earneſtly laboured, but at <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi>
                  <pb n="845" facs="tcp:17208:432"/>
in <hi>Bithynia;</hi> to ſhew, that that was his right, and belonged to him onely. And when <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> in that bickering which hee had with <hi>Ierome,</hi> had alleadged a certaine <hi>Synod, Tell mee,</hi> ſayes <hi>Ierome, what Emperour cauſed it to bee called. Ierome</hi> did not thinke the authoritie of a <hi>Generall Councell</hi> firme e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, vnleſſe an <hi>Emperour</hi> had called it. I demand not now, what <hi>Emperor</hi> hath commanded the Biſhops to be called to <hi>Trent</hi> at this preſent: But with what <hi>Emperor</hi> did the <hi>Pope,</hi> that hath taken thus much to himſelfe, aduiſe of holding the <hi>Councell,</hi> what <hi>Chriſtian King</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> did hee make priuy to his deſigne? To intrude vpon anothers right by fraude or force, and to vſurpe for his owne, what belongs to others, is iniurious dealing. But to abuſe the <hi>Clemency</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> and to rule ouer them as his vaſſalls, is an egregious and an intollerable diſgrace to them. But for vs, by our comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to goe about to backe ſuch an iniurie, and diſgrace, were no leſſe iniurie. Wherefore if wee ſhould onely ſay thus much, that this <hi>Trent Councell</hi> of yours is not lawfully called, that <hi>Pope Pius</hi> hath done nothing rightly or orderly, no man could iuſtly find fault with our abſence.</p>
               <p n="9">9 I paſſe ouer the wrongs, which the <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> haue done vs: That they haue as often as they pleaſed, armed our <hi>People</hi> againſt their <hi>Soueraigne:</hi> That they haue pulld the <hi>Scepters</hi> out of our <hi>Kings</hi> hands, and the <hi>Crownes</hi> from off their heades: That they would haue the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to bee theirs, and held in their name, and our <hi>Kings</hi> to Reigne by their fauour: That within theſe later yeares, they haue ſtirred vp againſt vs, ſomtimes the <hi>French,</hi> ſomtimes the <hi>Emperor.</hi> What the intentions of <hi>Pius</hi> himſelfe haue beene towards vs, what hee hath done, what hee hath ſpoken, what hee hath practiſed, what hee hath threatened, t'is needleſſe to rehearſe: For his actions and his words are not ſo cloſe, ſo concealed, but that the aime of both may be diſcouered. By what courſes hee was made <hi>Pope,</hi> and by what ſteps hee mounted to ſo great a dignity, I ſay nothing. I doe not ſay, that he aſpired to the <hi>Popedome</hi> by corrupting of <hi>Cardinals,</hi> buying of voices, by price and purchaſe, by vnderminings, and ambuſhes. I doe not ſay that late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, beeing not able to quitt ſkores, hee caſt <hi>Cardinall Caraffa</hi> into priſon and there murthered him, by whoſe aſſiſtance he had compaſſed the reſt of the <hi>Cardinals voyces,</hi> to whom for that ſeruice he owed a great ſumme of money. Theſe, and diuers other things, I leaue to you, who both behold them at a neerer diſtance, and better vnderſtand them. And can you wonder then, that wecome not to a man of Blood, one that purchaſes voyces, that denies to pay his debts, to a <hi>Simoniacal</hi> perſon, to an <hi>Heretique?</hi> Beleeue me, it is not the part of a wiſe man wilfully to runne into a place infected, and to conſult of Religion with the enemies of Religion. <hi>My mother,</hi> ſayes one, <hi>forbade mee the company of infamous perſons. Iohn</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> durſt not ſit in the ſame Bath, nor waſh with <hi>Olympius,</hi> leſt he ſhould bee ſtrucke from heauen with the ſame thunder. I haue not ſate, ſayth <hi>Dauid,</hi> in the aſſembly of Vanitie, neither will I walke with the workers of iniquitie.</p>
               <p n="10">10 But admitte that this is the Popes proper right; let it bee in his power to call <hi>Councels,</hi> to gouerne the whole world: Let thoſe things bee falſe and vaine, whatſoeuer wee haue ſpoken concerning the power of the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> and the right of <hi>Kings:</hi> Grant that <hi>Pope Pius</hi> is an honeſt man; that
<pb n="846" facs="tcp:17208:433"/>
he was duely and lawfully made <hi>Pope;</hi> that he ſought no mans life; that he did not kill <hi>Caraffa</hi> in priſon: yet it is fit that <hi>Councels</hi> ſhould be free, that euery man may be preſent that will, and thoſe, with whoſe conuenience it ſtands not, may bee abſent. And ſuch was anciently the equitie and moderation of thoſe better men. The <hi>Princes</hi> were not then called together in ſuch a ſlauiſh manner, that if any one of them had ſtayed at home, or had not ſent <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours</hi> to the <hi>Councell,</hi> preſently euery eye was vpon him, euery finger poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at him. In the <hi>Nicen Councel,</hi> in the <hi>Epheſine,</hi> in that of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> what ſpie obſerued who were abſent? But there was neuer an <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi> then, neither from <hi>England,</hi> nor <hi>Scotland,</hi> nor <hi>Poland,</hi> nor <hi>Spaine,</hi> nor out of the two <hi>Pannonia's,</hi> nor out of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> nor out of all <hi>Germanie.</hi> See, reade, reexamine the <hi>Subſcriptions,</hi> you ſhall finde it ſo, as I ſay. And why doe not you maruaile then, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came not to thoſe <hi>Councels,</hi> beeing ſo full, ſo famous, ſo renowned, ſo frequented? Or that the <hi>Popes</hi> in thoſe times were ſo patient, as not to condemne them of contumacie? But this tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Popes</hi> was not yet growen vp; it was lawfull then for <hi>holy Biſhops and Fathers,</hi> as it ſtood with their conuenience, to ſtay at home without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice. The <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> would not put himſelfe vpon the <hi>Councell</hi> at <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> but rather appeal'd to <hi>Caſar. Athanaſius</hi> the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> though the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi> ſummoned him to the <hi>Councell</hi> at <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> yet hee would not come. The ſame man, in the <hi>Syrmian Councell,</hi> when he ſaw that the <hi>Arrians</hi> were like to preuaile, preſently withdrew himſelfe, and went his wayes: and the <hi>Westerne Biſhops</hi> following his example, refuſed to come to that <hi>Councell. Iohn Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> came not to the <hi>Arrian Councell,</hi> though the <hi>Emperour Constantius</hi> called him, both by letter, and alſo by meſſage. At what time the <hi>Arrian Biſhops</hi> aſſembled in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and drew with them the votes of the maior part, old <hi>Paphnutius</hi> and <hi>Maximus Biſhop of Ieruſalem,</hi> went out together out of the middeſt of their aſſembly. <hi>Biſhop Cyril</hi> appealed from the <hi>Councell</hi> of the <hi>Patropaſſians. Paulinus Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Triers</hi> would not come to the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Millan,</hi> becauſe that he ſaw, that by the fauor and power of the <hi>Emperor Conſtantius,</hi> all ranne of <hi>Auxentius</hi> the <hi>Arrians</hi> ſide. The <hi>Biſhops</hi> that had met in a <hi>Councell</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> being called to a <hi>Councell</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> refuſed to come. Which notwithſtanding turned not to their preiudice, though they were called by the <hi>Emperors</hi> letters. In thoſe dayes the excuſe ſeemed reaſonable enough, that they were to intend the charge and reformation of their owne <hi>Churches.</hi> Though they ſawe that the <hi>Arrians</hi> did play reakes in all <hi>Churches</hi> and that their preſence would haue beene of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the abating of their rage.</p>
               <p n="11">11 What if our <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſhould now giue the ſame anſwere, that they can ſpare no time from their ſacred function; that they are wholly imployed in ſetting vp againe their owne <hi>Churches;</hi> that they cannot be abſent, fiue, ſix, ſeuen yeares, eſpecially there, where they ſhould bee able to doe no good. For our <hi>Biſhops</hi> are not ſo idle, as thoſe at <hi>Rome</hi> that frolick it in their palaces, and daunce attendance vpon the <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> and hunt after liuings. Our <hi>Churches</hi> are ſo miſerably waſted and ruined by them, that they cannot bee repaired in a ſmall time, or with ordinarie diligence. But now wee ſee plainely that theſe men ſeeke to incroach vpon our times, that without any
<pb n="847" facs="tcp:17208:433"/>
neceſſitie we might be drawen abroade and ſo diſabled to aduance the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell</hi> at home, and in the <hi>Councell</hi> be hindred by them.</p>
               <p n="12">12 For the <hi>Pope,</hi> that you may not bee miſtaken, doeth but make a ſhewe of a <hi>Councell,</hi> and meanes it not, for thinke not that hee doth any thing ſincerely or truely. <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleuenth was wont to ſay to <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, that Hee <hi>that knowes not how to make ſhewes of what he meanes not, kens not Kings-craft:</hi> But, as the times goe now, he that knowes not how to make no ſhewe of what hee meanes, and to cloake his deſignes vnder a diſguiſed countenance, is much more ignorant how to play the <hi>Pope.</hi> For that <hi>Sea</hi> is wholly ſupported with mere hypocriſie, which the leſſe naturall ſtrength it hath, ſo much the more colour it needes. For if the <hi>Popes</hi> thought a <hi>Generall Councell</hi> ſo effectuall for remouing of <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> why did they differre a thing ſo neceſſarie thus long? Why did they ſit quiet thirty yeares together, and ſuffered <hi>Luthers Doctrine</hi> to take roote? Why did they not call a <hi>Councell,</hi> with the firſt? Why did they aſſemble the <hi>Trent Councell</hi> with ſuch reluctancy and vnwillingneſſe, more by the inſtigation of the <hi>Emperour Charles,</hi> then of their owne accord? And hauing beene at <hi>Trent</hi> well nigh tenne yeares, with all this deliberation why haue they done iuſt nothing? Why haue they left the matter vndone? Who hindred, who with ſtood them? Beleeue mee in this, <hi>Good Brother,</hi> the <hi>Popes</hi> are not in hand now to Keepe a ſolemne <hi>Councell,</hi> or to reſtore religion, which they make a mocke of. That which they intend, and ſeeke, and labour for, is to delude the minds of godly men, and the whole world with a pompous expectation of a <hi>Generall Councell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13 They ſee that their wealth hath beene leſſening now a pretty while, and declining: That their tricks doe not find the ſame credit now, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: That an incredible number of men euery day fall from them: That men doe not now runne to <hi>Rome</hi> in ſuch troupes: That there is not now a dayes ſo high an eſtimation, or ſo deare a price giuen for <hi>indulgences, interdicts, bleſſings, abſolutions, and empty Bulls:</hi> That their <hi>Mart</hi> of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Maſſes</hi> and all their whoriſh paintings are ſlighted: That a great part of their tiranny and pompe is ſhruncke: That their reuenewes are ſlenderer then they were wont to bee: That they and theirs are laughed at euery where, euen by very children: That their whole reſt lies now at ſtake. And indeede it is no wonder if thoſe things fall, which had no rootes to hold them. Our <hi>Sauiour</hi> IESVS CHRIST extinguiſhed all thoſe things, not by armes or force of men, but by the heauenly blaſt and breath of his mouth; but will conſume and aboliſh them with the brightneſſe of his comming. This is the force of <hi>Gods word;</hi> this is the power of the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> theſe bee the weapons, by which is ouerthrowne euery fortification, which is raiſed againſt the knowledge of <hi>God.</hi> This doctrine ſhall bee preached through the whole world in deſpight of them all: the gates of <hi>Hell</hi> ſhall not preuaile againſt it. The merit-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſhopps waxe cold now at <hi>Rome;</hi> their wares, as if <hi>Porſenna</hi>'s goods were put to ſale, are very lowe pric'd, and yet can ſcarce finde a chapman. The indulgence-broker trots vp and downe, and finds no fooles. This is it; Hence growes their griefe; This vexes the <hi>Popes.</hi> They ſee that
<pb n="848" facs="tcp:17208:434"/>
this ſo great light broke foorth from one ſparke: What is it like to doe now, when ſo many fires are kindled in all places of the world? And ſo many <hi>Chriſtian Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> acknowledge and profeſſe the <hi>Gospell?</hi> For they ſerue not CHRIST IESVS, but their <hi>Bellies.</hi> They ſay that <hi>Carneades</hi> the Philoſopher, when hee was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and made that memorable ſpeech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iuſtice;</hi> amongſt other things he added this, that this vertue, if it were one, would bee leſſe profitable to no kinde of men, then to the <hi>Romans:</hi> For they by force and robbery had ſubdued other mens dominions to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and had compaſſed the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> by high iniuſtice. Now if they would at length obſerue Iuſtice, they muſt reſtore all thoſe things, which they poſſeſſe vniuſtly: They muſt returne to their ſhepheards hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and their cold Cottages, which was all they had in the beginning. So verely theſe men, if they would deale plainely, and lay aſide their diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and doe their duety, and render euery one his owne, they ſee they muſt come to their ſtaffe and ſcrippe againe, to ſobrietie and modeſtie, to the labours and function of the Goſpell. For they haue heard <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſay, that, The name of a Biſhop, is a name of worke, not of worſhip; and, That they are no Biſhops that would haue the preeminence aboue others, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit them. And therefore they ſee, that it is leſſe expedient for themſelues, then for any ſort of men, to haue the Goſpell ſpread wider, and further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated: for they cannot bee ſafe, if they will bee ſound. Therefore now they raiſe tumults, and puzzle all, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Smith did of old, when hee ſaw that his hopes of gaine were cut. Now therefore <hi>Councels</hi> are ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned, the <hi>Abbats</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> are called to make a partie. For this they thought the cunningeſt plot, to ſpinne out the time for ſome yeeres, to hold mens mindes in ſuſpence with expectation: many things, as it vſeth, might fall out in the meane time: Some <hi>Warre</hi> might be raiſed: One of theſe <hi>Princes</hi> might die: that this ſo ſharpe edge of theirs for the Goſpell, might in proceſſe of time bee dulled: mens mindes might waxe coole: In the meane while, as one ſayes, ſomewhat will be done I hope.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Long ſince, the <hi>Perſians</hi> hauing beene vanquiſhed and led in triumph, when as the <hi>Athenians</hi> had begun to repaire their walles, which the <hi>Perſians</hi> had layd leuell with the ground; and the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had ſtraitly interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them, to the end that they might keep them the eaſier vnder their check: <hi>Themistocles</hi> the Athenian Generall, a wiſe man, ſeeing the ſafety of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey might be hazzarded, promiſed that he would come to <hi>Lacedemon</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with them about it. So, being vpon the way, to ſpend time, he faignes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſicke, that hee might dwell the longer vpon his iourney. At length, beeing come to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> hee began to make many cauils on ſet purpoſe: Somtimes the couenants did not pleaſe him: Somtimes hee demands time to aduiſe: Sometimes hee muſt waite for his fellowe <hi>Ambaſſadours,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom nothing could bee done: otherwiſe he muſt ſend <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> to <hi>Athens.</hi> In the meane time, whileſt he trifles, the <hi>Athenians</hi> had walled their <hi>City</hi> round; and, if any force were offered, were prouided of a defence. So theſe men, whileſt they putt off from day to day, and will haue all referred to <hi>Councels;</hi> in the meane while they build vp their walls, whilſt we ſitt idle,
<pb n="849" facs="tcp:17208:434"/>
looking after wee know not what; that at the laſt, when they haue made all ſafe, they may ſhutt vs out wholly, and neither <hi>Councell,</hi> may be held, nor any thing at all done.</p>
               <p n="15">15 For it is worth the paines to obſerue their trickes, and fetches; How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Councels</hi> haue been ſummoned, and not met. How often a poore rumor hath daſhed all their preparation, and all the expectation! How often haue the Fathers made a ſtand vpon the ſudden in the middeſt of their iourney! How often haue the ſcarlet <hi>Counſailers,</hi> ſlipped home in the middeſt of the <hi>Councell,</hi> hauing done iuſt nothing; and haue reiourned the next Seſſion till the ninth or tenth yeere following! How often haue they quarrelled with the ayre, the victuals, the place, the time! For the <hi>Pope</hi> onely aſſembles the <hi>Councels,</hi> and hee alone diſmiſſeth them when hee liſts. If any thing pleaſe him not, or the buſineſſe beginne to goe awry, preſently the ſolemne cloſe of the Playes is heard, <hi>Valete, &amp; Plaudite,</hi> Farewell, and clap your hands. A <hi>Councell</hi> is warn'd at <hi>Baſil:</hi> They meete from all parts in great numbers: They fall earneſtly vpon many matters: <hi>Eugenius</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> is caſt by all the voyces, as a <hi>Simoniacall</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticall Perſon: Amideus,</hi> Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> is put in his place: <hi>Eugenius,</hi> as hee was to doe, takes this indignely, thinkes with himſelfe, that this might bee a dangerous preſident for poſteritie: That his power and ſtrength was far aboue all <hi>Councels:</hi> That a <hi>Councel</hi> could not meet but by his command: nor determine of any thing, but what hee pleaſed: That it was an vngodly act, to inquire into his life in a <hi>Conuenticle</hi> of <hi>Biſhops:</hi> Preſently he cals backe the <hi>Councel</hi> to <hi>Ferrara</hi> in <hi>Italie;</hi> afterwards tranſlates it to <hi>Florence.</hi> Why what doings is this, I pray? Did <hi>Eugenius</hi> thinke the climate would alter mens mindes, or that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> would giue diſcreeter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in <hi>Italie,</hi> then he had formerly in <hi>Germany?</hi> Nay, nay, in all thoſe chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he ſought not after CHRIST, but his own benefit. He ſaw that his enemy <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> the Emperor, did ouertoppe him in <hi>Germanie,</hi> both in power, and in fauour; And that thoſe Fathers which had met at <hi>Baſil,</hi> if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued out of thoſe harſh and rough Countreys into <hi>Italie,</hi> they might (as trees when they are tranſplanted) bee made more mellow. For now adayes (mercifull God!) the intent or ſcope of <hi>Councels,</hi> is not to diſcouer trueth, or to confute falſhood. For theſe later ages, this hath been the onely indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the <hi>Popes,</hi> to eſtabliſh the <hi>Romane Tyranny;</hi> to ſet warres on foote; to ſet <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> together by the eares; to raiſe money, ſometimes for the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> ſometimes for the building of <hi>Saint Peters Church,</hi> ſometimes for other vſes; I know not what, or rather abuſes; all which money was to be caſt into ſome few bellies, in gluttonie, and luſt. And this hath beene the onely cauſe or courſe of <hi>Councels</hi> for ſome ages laſt paſt. For of errours and abuſes, as if there were none at all, nothing euer could bee handled.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>Peter de Alliaco</hi> made great complaint in the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the couetouſneſſe and pride of the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> but what good did hee? Was there any part of their controuerſie or pride reſtrained by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the <hi>Councel?</hi> The ſame man ſayes, that Holy dayes, and the flocks of idle Monkes ought in his opinion to bee leſſened: And another (in a certaine Worke intituled, <hi>Tripartite,</hi> and ioyned to the <hi>Lateran Councel)</hi> The whole world almoſt, ſayes hee, ſpeakes againſt it, and is ſcandalized at the

infinite multitude of beggerly Friars. And the Fathers in the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran,</hi> wee ſtrictly commaund, ſay they, that for the future no man inuent a new religious order. Since that time what hath been done for Holy dayes. I know not: it is probable, that no abatement is made. But for the <hi>Orders</hi> of <hi>Monkes,</hi> they are infinitely multiplied. For the laſt <hi>Popes</hi> haue added <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, Capuchins</hi> and <hi>Theatines;</hi> as if there had not beene yet enough of theſe ſlow-bellies. <hi>Iohn Gerſon,</hi> Chancellour of <hi>Paris,</hi> exhibited in the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi> of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> ſeuentie fiue abuſes in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hee did earneſtly deſire might bee reformed. But of ſo great a number, what one abuſe did they take away? <hi>Iohn Picus Mirandula</hi> writes to <hi>Pope Leo,</hi> to abridge idle ceremonies, and to reſtraine the luxurie of <hi>Prieſts.</hi> The <hi>Biſhops</hi> afterwards, in the <hi>Lateran Councell</hi> ſate in great numbers, and moued much expectation. But what one ceremonie did they abate? what one <hi>Priests</hi> luxury or lewdneſſe did they condemne. <hi>Mantuan</hi> the <hi>Poet</hi> complaines by name of the manners of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome. Bernard</hi> the <hi>Abbot</hi> writes thus to <hi>Pope Eugenius:</hi> your Court receiues good men, but makes them not: lewde men thriue there, the good pine and fall away. And ſpeaking of the woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſtate of the <hi>Church</hi> in thoſe dayes, From the ſole of the foote ſaith he, to the crowne of the head, there is no health in her. And againe ſaies he, where is there one to preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord? Now a dayes, ſaith hee, they keepe not <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſpouſe, but deſtroy her; They feede not the Lords flocke but ſlaughter and deuoure it. <hi>Pope Adrian</hi> the ſixth, when hee ſent his <hi>Legat</hi> into <hi>Germanie,</hi> confeſſed truely and ingenuouſly, that the ſtate of the whole <hi>Clergie</hi> was moſt corrupt. All wee <hi>Prelates,</hi> ſaies hee, haue ſwerued euery one to his owne way, neither is there now any one that doeth good, no not one. <hi>Albertus Pighius</hi> confeſſes, that in the <hi>Maſſe</hi> it ſelfe, (which they would haue to bee moſt ſacred, and in which alone they place the main of <hi>Chriſtian Religion)</hi> are found errors and abuſes. What needs more? I paſſe ouer other witneſſes, for they are infinite. There were many <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels</hi> held after this; the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were called together; the <hi>Synode</hi> of <hi>Baſill</hi> was ſummoned, as they then made ſhewe, expreſly for the reformation of the whole <hi>Clergie.</hi> But ſince that time, the errors haue beene increaſed in all places; nay the vices of the <hi>Priests</hi> themſelues doubled.</p>
               <p n="17">17 The <hi>Cardinals</hi> choſen by <hi>Pope Paul</hi> the third, to conſider of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> made report, that there were many corruptions in it, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the manners of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Clergie</hi> men. That the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were idle; did not inſtruct the people, nor feede the flocke, nor looke to the <hi>Lords</hi> vineyard: that they liued in <hi>Princes Courts,</hi> and kept not home: That the <hi>Cardinals</hi> had ſomtimes three, ſomtimes fowre <hi>Biſhoprickes</hi> in <hi>Commendam,</hi> not without great preiudice to the <hi>Church:</hi> for that thoſe offices are not, as they ſay, compatible, or to bee held together.

by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> when they returned to the <hi>Church,</hi> ought to bee baptized againe. Which error could not bee afterwards repealed but ſo many <hi>Councels</hi> and writings of the Fathers. What needes many words? The <hi>Second Epheſine Councell</hi> openly tooke <hi>Eutyches</hi> his part, that the humane nature in <hi>Chriſt</hi> was turned into his diuinitie. The ſecond <hi>Nicene Councell</hi> decreed flatt Idolatrie about adoration of Images. The Councel of <hi>Baſil,</hi> as <hi>Albertus Pighius</hi> ſayes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed againſt all antiquity, againſt nature, againſt reaſon, againſt the word of <hi>God.</hi> The Councell of <hi>Ariminum</hi> decreed for the <hi>Arrians</hi> moſt impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not <hi>God.</hi> Many other enſuing Councels, that of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the <hi>Arrian,</hi> the <hi>Seleucian,</hi> the <hi>Syrmian</hi> did both condemne the <hi>Homouſians,</hi> and alſo ſubſcribe to the impietie of the Councell of <hi>Ariminum.</hi> What would you haue more? The Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> it ſelfe, which was one of thoſe foure that <hi>Gregorie</hi> compares with the fower Goſpells, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> did not ſticke to challenge it of vnaduiſedneſſe.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Therefore we ſee <hi>Councels</hi> haue been often oppoſite one to another: And as <hi>Leo</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> abrogated the Acts of <hi>Adrian, Stephanus</hi> of <hi>Formoſus, Iohn</hi> of <hi>Stephanus;</hi> And as <hi>Sabinian</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> commanded all <hi>Pope Gregories</hi> writings to bee burnt, as erronious and impious: So wee ſee oftentimes that a later <hi>Councell,</hi> hath repealed all the Decrees of a former. The <hi>Carthage Councell</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould not bee called either <hi>The High Prieſt,</hi> or <hi>The chiefe of Prieſts,</hi> or by any other the like name. But following <hi>Councels</hi> haue ſtiled him, not onely <hi>Chiefe Prieſt,</hi> but alſo <hi>Chiefe Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Catholique Church.</hi> The <hi>Eliberine Councell</hi> decreed that nothing ſhould be painted on the wals of <hi>Churches,</hi> that ought of right to bee worſhipped. The <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> decreed that <hi>Images</hi> were not to bee ſuffered in <hi>Chriſtian Churches.</hi> On the other ſide, the ſecond <hi>Nicen Councell,</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that <hi>Images</hi> were not onely to bee placed in <hi>Churches,</hi> but alſo to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. The <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell vnder <hi>Pope Iulius</hi> the ſecond, was ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for no other cauſe, but to repeale the Decrees of the <hi>Piſan</hi> Councell. So oftentimes the later Biſhops oppoſe thoſe that went before them, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels damme vp one anothers lights. For theſe men will not be tyed, no not to their owne Councels, but as far as they pleaſe, and is commodious for them, and wil bring griſt to their Mill. The <hi>Baſil</hi> Councel determined that a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Biſhops was aboue the <hi>Pope.</hi> But the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councel vnder <hi>Leo</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that the Pope was aboue the Councell. And the Pope does not onely beare himſelfe ſo, but alſo commands him to be held for an heretike that ſhall thinke otherwiſe. But yet all the Biſhops and Abbats in the Councell of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> ſay thus, He that oppoſeth theſe truths is to be accounted an heretike. How wil you behaue your ſelfe, I beſeech you! Whatſoeuer you ſay, or thinke, either the Pope or the Councell will eſteeme you an heretique. All Popes, for ſome ages laſt paſt, haue oppoſed theſe trueths: therefore all Popes, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in theſe ages, haue been Heretiques, in the iudgement of the Councel of <hi>Baſil.</hi> The ſame Councell did with an vniforme conſent remooue Pope <hi>Eugenius,</hi> a Simoniacal and Schiſmaticall perſon, and put <hi>Amideus</hi> in his place. But <hi>Eugenius</hi> vilifies the Councels Decree; and though hee were moſt Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacall and Schiſmaticall, yet he continued to bee the Succeſſor of <hi>Peter,</hi> the Vicar of CHRIST, and Head of the whole Church of GOD. Hee retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="853" facs="tcp:17208:436"/>
his former dignitie in deſpight of all their teeth, and was magnificently carried, as before, vpon noble mens ſhoulders. <hi>Amideus,</hi> as one fallen from his horſe, walked on foote like a ſimple man, and thought himſelfe happie, that of a Pope he was made a Cardinall. The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Biſhops ſhould teach the people, and that no one man ſhould haue more then one Spirituall preferment at one time: But they, contrary to the Edict of their Councell, accumulate Benefices, and inſtruct not at all. So they make Lawes, but obey them not, but when they liſt. This is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme they haue alwayes made of their owne Councels, and the Decrees thereof.</p>
               <p n="22">22 And why ſhould wee hope for better ſucceſſe at this preſent? With what expectation or hope can any one come to the Councell? Doe but thinke with your ſelfe what manner of men they bee, vpon whoſe fidelitie learning and iudgement, the weight of this whole Councell, the diſcuſſing of all queſtions, and the whole ſtate of all things muſt lye and reſt. They are called Abbots and Biſhops, graue perſons, and faire titles, men (as it is beleeued) of great importance for the gouernment of the Church of GOD. But take from theſe men their titles, the perſons they beare, and their trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, there will nothing that belongeth to an Abbot or a Biſhop remaine in them. For they are not miniſters of CHRIST, diſpenſers of the myſteries of GOD; they apply not themſelues to reading, or to preach the Goſpell; they feede not the flocke, they till not the ground, they plant not the Lords Vineyard, nor kindle the fire, nor beare the Arke of the Lord, nor are the Ambaſſadours of CHRIST: they watch not, nor doe the worke of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt, nor performe the duety of their miniſtery: they intangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with ſecular buſineſſes; they hide the Lords treaſure; they take away the keyes of the Kingdome of God; they goe not in themſelues, nor ſuffer others; they beate their fellow ſeruants, they feede themſelues, and not the flocke: they ſleepe, ſnort, feaſt, and ryot: they are cloudes without water, ſtarres without light, dumbe dogges, ſlow bellies; as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayth, not Prelates, but Pilats; not Doctours, but ſeducers; not Paſtors, but impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: The ſeruants of CHRIST (ſaith hee) ſerue Antichriſt. The Popes will allow none but theſe to haue place and ſuffrage in the Councell: The care and charge of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Catholike Church muſt depend vpon their power and iudgement: Vpon none but ſuch as theſe doth Pope <hi>Pius</hi> relie. But (good GOD) what manner of perſons are they? They hold it ridiculous to aske that queſtion. It is no matter (ſay they) how learned, or how reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious they bee; what their aime is, or what they thinke: If they can ſit vpon a Mule; if they can ride through the ſtreetes with pompe, and with a noyſe; if they can come into the Councell, and ſay nothing, it is ſufficient. If you beleeue mee not, and thinke I ſpeake in ieſt, heare what the facultie of Diuinitie, and the whole <hi>Sorbone,</hi> haue determined concerning this matter. That which our great maſters affirme (ſay they) concerning the due aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of a Councell, is to bee vnderſtood thus; that for the lawfull calling of a Councell it is ſufficient, that the forme of Law be ſolemnely obſerued. For if it ſhould bee diſputed, whether the Prelates there aſſembled haue a good intention; whether they bee learned, eſpecially in the Scriptures, and
<pb n="854" facs="tcp:17208:437"/>
are willing to obey wholeſome doctrine, it would proue an infinite buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thoſe, forſooth, who fit mute, like the ſtatues of <hi>Mercurie,</hi> not knowing what belongs to Religion, will determine well concerning all points of Religion, and, whatſoeuer they ſay, they cannot poſſibly erre.</p>
               <p n="23">23 Theſe are obliged to the Pope, not through error and ignorance, but by oath and religion: So that although they ſhould vnderſtand the trueth, they cannot without periurie make profeſſion of it, and are neceſſitated to breake faith, either with God or man. For this is the formal oath which they all take. I N. C. Biſhop, will henceforward beare true faith to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike Roman Church, to my Lord the Pope N. and his ſucceſſors, which ſhall enter canonically. I will not be a meanes, either by word or deede, that he may looſe, either life or member, or be taken priſoner: I will not reueale any counſell that hee ſhall impart vnto mee, either by letters or meſſage, which may be any way dammageable to him: I will help to defend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine againſt all the world the Papacie of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the rules of the holy Fathers. In old time, when the Prieſts of <hi>Appollo Pytheus</hi> began to ſpeake plainly in fauour of King <hi>Philip,</hi> many would merrily ſay, that <hi>Apollo</hi> began to <hi>Philippize.</hi> When we ſee that nothing is decreed in the Councell, but at the Popes pleaſure, why may wee not ſay that the oracles of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels doe <hi>Tapize;</hi> that is, ſay nothing but what the Pope will. When <hi>Verres</hi> was charged with many crimes, of which in probabilitie he was guiltie, they ſay he was ſo wiſe, as not to commit his triall to any, but onely to ſome truſty perſons of his owne traine. The Popes haue dealt more wiſely: For they haue choſen ſuch iudges, whom they know neither will (becauſe it is their owne caſe, in regard they refer all to voluptuouſneſſe and gluttonie) nor can if they would (becauſe they are ſworne) decree any thing contrary to his will and pleaſure. They ſet the holy Bible in the midſt, as if they would doe nothing againſt it: they looke vpon it afarre off, and reade it not. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede they bring a preiudicated opinion with them, not regarding what <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſaid, but decreeing whatſoeuer they pleaſe.</p>
               <p n="24">24 Therefore that libertie which ought to be in all conſultations, eſpecially ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and which is moſt proper to the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the modeſtie of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, is quite taken away. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, If any thing be reauealed to another that <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14 30.</note> ſitteth by, let the firſt hold his peace: But theſe men apprehend, impriſon and burne whoſoeuer dareth but whiſper againſt them. Witneſſe hereof the cruell death of two moſt holy and reſolute men, <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> whom they put to death contrary to their ſafe conduct, &amp; ſo brake their faith, both with God and man. So the wicked <hi>Prophet Zedekias,</hi> when he had put on iron hornes, ſtrooke <hi>Micheas</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> of the Lord on the face, ſaying, how hath the ſpirit of God left me, and is come to thee? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe men alone domineere in Councels, all others being excluded. They alone giue voices, and make lawes; like vnto the <hi>Epheſians</hi> in times paſt: let no man (ſay they) liue here, who is wiſer then the reſt, except he haue a mind to be caſt into baniſhment. They will not heare any of our men ſpeak. In the laſt conuention of the Councel at <hi>Trent,</hi> tenne yeres ſince, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of the Princes and free Cities of <hi>Germanie</hi> came thither with a purpoſe to be heard, but were abſolutely refuſed. For the Biſhops and Abbots an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="855" facs="tcp:17208:437"/>
that they would not ſuffer their cauſe to haue a free hearing, nor ſuffer controuerſies to be diſcuſſed out of the word of God: that our men were not to be heard at all except they would recant; which if they refuſed to doe, they ſhould come into the Councell vpon none other condition but to heare the ſentence of condemnation pronounced againſt them. For <hi>Iulius</hi> the third in his Bull of indiction of the Councell declared plainely that either they ſhould change their opinions, or elſe ſhould bee condemned for heretiques before they were heard. <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth who hath now a purpoſe to reaſſemble the Councell, hath alreadie preiudged for heretiques all thoſe who haue left the Roman Church, that is to ſay, the greateſt part of the Chriſtian world, before they were euer either ſeene or heard. They ſay, and they ſay it often, that alreadie all is well with them, and that they will not alter one iot of their doctrine and Religion. <hi>Albertus Pighius</hi> ſaith, that without the authoritie of the Roman Church one ought not to beleeue the cleereſt, and plaineſt Scripture. Is this to reſtore the Church to her inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie? Is this to ſeeke the trueth? Is this the libertie and moderation of Councels?</p>
               <p n="25">25 Though theſe things bee moſt vniuſt, and moſt different from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of ancient Councels and of modeſt men, yet this is more vniuſt, that whereas the world complaineth of the Papall pride and tyrannie, and doth beleeue that nothing can be amended in the Church of God vntill he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into order, yet all things are referred vnto him, as vnto a moſt conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pence maker and iudge. And vnto what a kind of man (good God) are they referred? I will not call him an enemie of the Trueth, ambitious, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous proud, intolerable, euen to his owne followers. But they would make iudge of all Religion him who commandeth that all his determinations ſhall bee of equall valew with thoſe of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> himſelfe, and ſayth, that in caſe hee carrie a thouſand ſoules with himſelfe to Hell, yet no man ought to reprehend him for it: who auoucheth that he can make iniuſtice to bee iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: whom <hi>Camotenſis</hi> affirmeth to haue corrupted the Scriptures, that he might haue fulneſſe of power: and to conclude, whom his owne fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars and followers <hi>(Ioachimus, Abbas Petrarch, Marſilius Patauinus, Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alla, Hieronymus Sauanorola)</hi> doe cleerely pronounce to bee <hi>The Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt.</hi> All is referred to the iudgement and will of this man alone; ſo that the ſame man is the partie arraigned, and the Iudge: the accuſers are heard from an inferiour place, and the partie accuſed ſits in his Tribunall, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the ſentence concerning himſelfe. Theſe lawes, forſooth, ſo equall, and ſo reaſonable, Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> hath giuen vs. No Councell (ſayth he) is of any credit, nor euer wil be, vnleſſe it be confirmed by the authority of the Church of <hi>Rome. Bonifacius</hi> 8. ſayth, That no creature in the world can poſſibly be ſaued, except he bee ſubiect to the <hi>Romane</hi> Church. And Pope <hi>Paſcal</hi> thus, As though, ſayth hee, any Councels haue made lawes for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when as all Councels doe ſubſiſt by it, and receiue their ſtrength from it; and doe expreſly except in all their Decrees the authoritie of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Another ſayth, That which the Pope approoueth or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth, wee ought to approoue or diſprooue likewiſe. And againe, It is not lawfull for any man to diſallow that which the Pope approoueth. I
<pb n="856" facs="tcp:17208:438"/>
know not what Paraſite it is who moſt ſhameleſly ſayth, that though all the world ſhould bee of one opinion againſt the Pope, yet it ſeemeth to mee that the Popes opinion muſt bee maintained. And another as impudently as hee, It is a kinde of ſacriledge but to diſpute of the Pope's fact, who though hee bee not alwayes a good man, yet muſt hee alwayes bee preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee. Another yet more impudently ſayth, The Pope's will is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly; therefore in thoſe things which hee willeth, his will ſtandeth for reaſon; neither ought any man to ſay to him, why doe you ſo? To leaue many the like ſayings, which are infinite, and to make an end, Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the ninth ſpeakes moſt impudently of all; The Iudge will not bee iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, neither by the Emperour, nor by Kings, nor by the whole Clergie, nor by all the people of the world. O immortall God! how neere are they come to ſay thus; I will aſcend vpon the North-pole, and I will be like to the moſt High. If the Popes ſay true, what neede wee a Councell? if they will hold a ſincere and a free Councell, away with theſe wicked and vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious lyes: Let them not onely not be practiſed, but let them euen bee raſed out of all their Bookes, that all may not bee left to the will and pleaſure of one man who is moſt iuſtly ſuſpected. But the Popes, ſay they, cannot erre, and that the word of GOD is to bee regulated as they pleaſe: Before they enter into their place they ſweare to maintaine certaine late Councels, which are moſt fowlly corrupted, and doe religiouſly promiſe that nothing ſhall bee changed. What maruaile then that no good comes of a Councell, if that errours and abuſes are not taken away? that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of Princes are in vaine called thither from ſo many remote parts? Notwithſtanding I heare that now there are ſome men, not ill affected, yet careleſſe what they ſay, who, though they condemne the arrogancie and <hi>Perſian</hi> pride of the Pope, and his euen <hi>Epicurean</hi> contempt of Religion, yet they deſire that his authority ſhould bee maintained: Though they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times confeſſe him to be Antichriſt, yet beeing mounted into that chayre, they doubt not but that he is <hi>Vniuerſall Biſhop</hi> and Head of the whole Church of CHRIST. Here they triumph and pleaſe themſelues, as if the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> were affixed to the Pope's palace. Yet the ſaying is, The place doth not ſanctifie the man, but the man the place. And <hi>Hierome,</hi> as hee is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, ſaith, that, They are not ſonnes of the Saints who hold their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but who imitate their deedes. Likewiſe <hi>Christ</hi> telleth vs, that the Scribes and Phariſees ſit in <hi>Moſes</hi> chayre, but warneth vs not to allow of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie further then they ſpeake out of the word of <hi>God. Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, What ſayd <hi>Chriſt</hi> but this; Heare the voyce of the Shepheard euen by hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings? For by ſitting in the chaire they teach the Law of God; therefore God doeth inſtruct vs by them. If they will teach ought of their owne, heare them not, doe it not. Likewiſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that Antichriſt, that man of ſinne, muſt fit in the Temple. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſayth, Well; doeſt thou conſider <hi>Peter?</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>Iudas</hi> alſo: doeſt thou allow of <hi>Stephen?</hi> marke alſo what <hi>Nicholas</hi> was. Eccleſiaſticall dignity maketh not a Chriſtian. Thus farre <hi>Hierome.</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that Pope <hi>Marcellinus</hi> ſacrificed to Idoles; that Pope <hi>Liberius</hi> was an <hi>Arrian;</hi> that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 22 had an impious opinion concerning the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie of the ſoule; that Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 8. was a woman, that ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="857" facs="tcp:17208:438"/>
adultery during her Papacie, and going pompouſly in proceſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Citie, was deliuered of a childe, euen in the very ſight of the Biſhops and Cardinals. And <hi>Liranus</hi> affirmeth, that many popes haue turned infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. Wherefore we muſt not bee too confident of places, and ſucceſſions, and vaine titles of dignities. Wicked <hi>Nero</hi> ſucceeded godly <hi>Metellus. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Aaron:</hi> and oftentimes Idoles are put in the place of GOD.</p>
               <p n="26">26 But what I pray you is this great power and authoritie, whereof they doe ſo inſolently boaſt? whence comes it? From Heauen, or of men? Chriſt ſpake vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> ſay they; vpon this rocke I will build my Church; by which words, the Popes authoritie is confirmed. For the Church of Chriſt is placed in <hi>Peter,</hi> as in the foundation. But Chriſt gaue nothing to <hi>Peter</hi> by theſe words more then to the other Apoſtles: neither doth hee make mention of the Pope, or of <hi>Rome.</hi> Chriſt is that rocke; Chriſt is that founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. No man, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> can lay another foundation then that which is alreadie laid, which is <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27 Theſe words, vpon this rock I will build my Church, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expoundeth thus: vpon this, ſaith he, which <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed, ſaying, Thou art <hi>Christ</hi> the ſonne of the liuing <hi>God.</hi> It is not ſaid thou art the rock, but thou art <hi>Peter:</hi> the rock was <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Saint <hi>Baſill</hi> ſaith thus: vpon this rock, that is, vpon this faith I will build my Church. <hi>Origen,</hi> that moſt ancient Father, ſaith that euery diſciple is a rocke, after that he hath drunke of that ſpirituall rock; and vpon ſuch a rocke all the doctrine of the Church is buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But if thou thinkeſt that the whole is built vpon <hi>Peter</hi> onely, what ſayeſt thou of <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſonne of thunder, and of each of the Apoſtles. For ſhall we be ſo bould as to ſay, the Gates of Hell ſhall not preuaile againſt <hi>Peter</hi> onely, and they ſhall preuaile againſt the reſt of the Apoſtles; and againſt good men? Or ſhall wee not rather ſay, let that which is ſpoken (and the Gates of Hell ſhall not preuaile againſt him; and that other, vpon this rock I will build my Church) be true in euery one of thoſe of whom it was ſpoken. Were the keyes of the kingdome giuen to <hi>Peter</hi> only, ſo that none of the other Saints might meddle with them. Then if this ſaying, (to thee I will giue the keyes of the kingdome of Heauen) be common to others alſo, why are not the other ſayings ſo to? Saint <hi>Hilarie</hi> ſaith, There is but one happie rocke of faith, which <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed with his mouth. And again he ſaith, Vpon this confeſſion of <hi>Peter</hi> the Church is built: and a little after hee ſaith, This faith is the foundation of the Church. In like manner other Fathers, <hi>Hierom, Cyrill, Beda,</hi> ſay that the Church is built, not vpon <hi>Peter,</hi> but vpon his faith, that is, vpon <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> the ſonne of <hi>God,</hi> whom <hi>Peter,</hi> by diuine inſpiration, confeſſed. <hi>Peter</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> taketh his name from the Rocke, not the Rocke from <hi>Peter;</hi> neither will I (ſayth hee) build my ſelfe vpon thee, but I will build thee vpon mee. So alſo <hi>Nicholas Lira</hi> (though hee bee not alwayes a good author; for you know in what age hee liued) ſaw thus much: Vpon this Rocke, ſayth hee, that is, vpon CHRIST. By this it appeareth, that the Church cannot relie wholly vpon any man by reaſon of any power, or Eccleſiaſticall dignitie, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Popes are knowen to be Apoſtats, haue been Apoſtats.</p>

28 Why then, wherein doeth this Papall authoritie conſiſt? In teaching? They teach not at all. In adminiſtring the Sacraments? They adminiſter them not. In feeding? Why they doe it not. Yet this is the power which CHRIST beſtowed on his Apoſtles. Goe (ſaith he) into the whole world, and preach the Goſpell: And afterward, Yee ſhall bee fiſhers of men. And, as my liuing Father ſent mee, ſo ſend I you. But theſe men whither go they? what doe they teach, or preach, or fiſh for? From whence goe they, or by whom are they ſent? This is not Apoſtolicall authoritie, but a proud into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable domination, vſurped by force and tyranny. None of vs (ſaith <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an)</hi> calleth himſelfe Biſhop of Biſhops, nor violently compelleth his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues to any neceſſary obedience, ſith euery Biſhop may vſe his libertie and power according to his owne diſcretion, without beeing iudged by any, ſeeing that hee himſelfe iudgeth no man. Againe hee ſaith, The other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were that which <hi>Peter</hi> was, and had the ſame fellowſhip of honour, and power. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, the authoritie of the world is greater then that of one Citie. Why doe you extoll the cuſtome of one Citie? Why doe you make a paucitie, whence pride began, to giue lawes to the Church? Whereſoeuer any Biſhop is, whether at <hi>Rome,</hi> or at <hi>Eugubium,</hi> or at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> or at <hi>Rhegium,</hi> hee is of the ſame deſert and Prieſthood. The ſtrength of riches, or humbleneſſe of pouertie maketh a Biſhop neither greater nor leſſe. <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſayth, <hi>Peter</hi> is the chiefe member in the bodie; <hi>Iohn, Andrew, Iames</hi> are Heads of particular people: yet all of them are members of the Church vnder one Head. Nay, the Saints before the Law, the Saints vnder the Law, the Saints vnder the Goſpel, and all that make vp the bodie of the Lord are to bee accounted members, and none was euer willing to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Vniuerſall.</p>
               <p n="29">29 This is that power which ſome doe ſo ſtrenuouſly defend at this day, which, whatſoeuer they thinke of the Popes life and religion, they would haue to bee moſt religiouſly maintained, as if the Church could not ſubſiſt without it; or as if a Councell were no Councell except the Pope did will and command it to be ſo; or as if the whole world muſt needs be deceaued, if it ſhould thinke otherwiſe. Wherefore now that you ſee that all things are moſt vniuſtly handled, that nothing is ſincerely and fairely caried in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, you may not wonder that our men had rather tarry at home, then take ſo long, and ſo idle a iourney, in which they ſhall both loſe their labour, and betray their cauſe.</p>
               <p n="30">30 You will ſay, it is not lawfull to make change in Religion without order from the Pope and the Councell. Yet the Popes haue changed almoſt the whole ſtate of the Primitiue Church without any Councell at all. You vſe a faire ſmooth ſpeach, but it is to couer foule errours. The purpoſe is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keepe mens minds in expectation, that being wearied with tedious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes, they may at the laſt deſpaire of any good. For what? while the Pope aſſembleth a Councell, while the Biſhops and Abbots returne home, will they haue GOD's people in the meane while, to bee deceiued, to erre, to miſtake themſelues, to bee ouerwhelmed with errours, and want of the knowledge of GOD, and ſo to bee carried to euerlaſting deſtruction? Is it not lawfull for any of vs to beleeue in CHRIST, to profeſſe the Goſpel, to
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:17208:439"/>
ſerue <hi>God</hi> aright, to flie ſuperſtition, and idolatrie, except they will be pleaſed to giue vs leaue? The ſtate of <hi>God's</hi> children were moſt miſerable, if, there being ſo many errors, ſo generally ſpread, ſo groſſe, ſo blind, ſo foule, and ſo perſpicuous and manifeſt, that euen our aduerſaries themſelues are not able to denie them, nothing could be done without the whole world ſhould meet in a generall Councell; the expectation whereof is very vncertaine, and the euent much more. In times paſt, when the <hi>Perſians</hi> inuaded <hi>Greece,</hi> and began to lay all waſte, if then the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> whoſe virtue was then moſt eminent amongſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> whoſe help was requiſite as ſoone as might be, had expected a more ſeaſonable moone to make warre in (for it was an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſuperſtition, which proceeded from <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> not to goe forth to fight but in a full moone) their Countrie might haue beene ſpoiled whilſt they deferred the time. They ſay, delay breeds danger. The ſafetie of <hi>God's</hi> Church is in queſtion; the Deuill goeth about roaring like a Lion, ſeeking whom he may deuoure. Simple men are eaſily deceaued; and though they be often touched with a zeal towards <hi>God,</hi> yet they perſecute the ſonne of <hi>God</hi> before they be aware: And, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſaith, when they purpoſe to fight for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they fight againſt him: Nay the Biſhops themſelues, who ought to haue a care of theſe things, are (as though they were but Ghoſts) careleſſe of them: or, to ſpeake truth, they increaſe the error, and make the miſt that is in their Religion twice as great as it was. Muſt wee therefore ſit idle, expecting how theſe Fathers will handle the matter? muſt wee hold our hands together and doe nothing. Nay, ſaith <hi>Cyprian,</hi> there is but one Biſhoprique, of which euery one holdeth an intire part, whereof he is to giue account to the Lord. I will require, ſaith the Lord, their bloud at thy handes. If any ſhall put his hand to the plough and looke backe, and be ſollicitous what others thinke, and expect the authoritie of a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and hide the Lord's treaſure, in the meane while, he ſhall here this, O euill and faithleſſe ſeruant! take him away, and caſt him into outward darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Suffer (ſaith <hi>Christ)</hi> the dead to burie their dead, but come thou and follow mee. In humane counſels, it is the part of a wiſe man to expect the iudgment and conſent of men? but in matters diuine, <hi>Gods</hi> word is all in all: the which ſo ſoone as a godly man hath receiued, hee preſently yeeldeth and ſubmitteth himſelfe; he is not wauering, not expecteth others. Hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth that he is not bound to giue care to the Pope, or the Councell, but to the will of <hi>God,</hi> whoſe voice is to be obeyed, though all men ſay nay. The <hi>Prophet Elias</hi> preſently obeyed <hi>God's</hi> command, though he thought he was alone; <hi>Abraham,</hi> being warned of <hi>God,</hi> went out of <hi>Chaldea; Lot</hi> went out of <hi>Sodome;</hi> the three Iſraelites made a publike confeſſion of their Religion, and did publiquely deteſt Idolatry, without expecting a generall Councell. Goe (ſaith the <hi>Angel)</hi> out of the midſt of her and partake not of her ſinnes, leſt you taſt of her Plagues. Hee ſaith not, expect a Synode of Biſhops. So <hi>God's</hi> trueth was firſt publiſhed, and ſo it is now to be reſtored. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> firſt taught the <hi>Goſpell</hi> without a publique Councell; in like manner the ſame <hi>Goſpell</hi> may be reſtored againe without a publique Councell. If at the firſt, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> would haue caried, and differred all vntill a generall Councell, when had their ſound gone forth into all lands? how had the
<pb n="860" facs="tcp:17208:440"/>
kingdome of heauen ſuffered violence? and how had the violent taken it by force? Where now would the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and the Church of <hi>God</hi> haue beene? As for our parts, we do not feare and flie, but deſire and wiſh for a Councell, ſo that it bee freely ingenuous, and Chriſtian; ſo that men doe meet as the <hi>Apostles</hi> did; ſo that Abbots and Biſhops be freed from their oath by which they are bound to the Popes; ſo that, that whole conſpiracie be diſſolued; ſo that our men may be modeſtly and freely heard, and not condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be heard; ſo that one man may, not haue power to ouerthrow whatſoeuer is done. But ſeeing it impoſsible (as the times now are) that this ſhould be obteyned; and ſeeing that all abſurd things, fooliſh, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, ſuperſtitious, impious are defended moſt pertinaciouſly, and that for cuſtome ſake, becauſe they haue beene once receiued, we haue thought it fit to prouide for our Churches by a nationall Councell.</p>
               <p n="31">31 For wee know that the ſpirit of <hi>God</hi> is tied neither to places, nor to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of men. Tel it to the Church, ſaith <hi>Chriſt:</hi> not to the whole Church ſpread ouer the world, but to a particular, which may eaſily meet in one place. Whereſoeuer, ſaith he, two or three ſhall bee, gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them. When <hi>Paul</hi> would reforme the Churches of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he did not command them to expect a Generall Councell; but onely wrot vnto them, that what error ſoeuer or vice was amongſt them, themſelues ſhould preſently cutt it off. So in times paſt, when Biſhops did ſleepe, or intended by-matters, or did defile and pollute the Lords Temple, <hi>God</hi> did alwaies extraordinarily rayſe vp ſome, men of great ſpirit and courage, who made all well and ſound againe.</p>
               <p n="32">32 For our ſelues, wee haue done nothing but with very good reaſon; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what wee ſawe to bee lawfull, and to haue beene practiſed by the Fathers of the primitiue Church, without any reprehenſion at all. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee called a full Synod of Biſhops, and, by common conſent of all ſorts, purged our Church, as it were <hi>Augeus</hi> his ſtable, of thoſe excrements, which either the negligence, or the malice of men had brought in. wee haue reſtored all things, as much as poſſibly wee could, to the ancient puritie of the Apoſtolicall times, and the ſimilitude of the primitiue Church. This was iuſtly in our power to doe, and becauſe wee could doe it, wee did it boldly.</p>
               <p n="33">33 Here I thinke it fit that you ſhould heare what Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt hath written concerning this matter; which pleaſeth mee the more, becauſe hee wrote it to <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Biſhop of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> about the inſtitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Hee exhorteth him not to call a Councell, but to ordaine that which he himſelfe in his own wiſdome did thinke would moſt promote pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and religion. Your brotherhood, ſayth hee, knoweth the Cuſtome of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, in which you haue been brought vp. It pleaſeth mee to heare, that you haue beene carefull to make choyce of as many things as you can finde acceptable to GOD, either in the Church of <hi>Rome, France,</hi> or of any other, that you may bring them into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, which is as yet but new in faith, and, as it were, but now to bee framed. For things are not to bee valewed becauſe of the place where they are found, but places
<pb n="861" facs="tcp:17208:440"/>
are to bee valewed for the things that are in them.</p>
               <p n="34">34 So the Fathers in the Councell of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> write to <hi>Damaſus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to the other Weſterne Biſhops: You know, ſay they, that the old Decree, and definition of the <hi>Nicen</hi> fathers concerning the care of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, hath alwayes been in force, that the huſbandmen of the Lord's vineyard in euery Prouince, taking their next bordering neighbours vnto them, if they pleaſe, ſhould beſtowe Eccleſiaſticall honours vpon thoſe whom they thinke will vſe them well. The Biſhops of <hi>Africa</hi> wrote thus to <hi>Celeſtinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> Let your Holineſſe, as becommeth you, take away all wicked euaſions of Prieſts, and inferiour Clergie-men, becauſe none of the Fathers haue denied this to the Church of <hi>Africa.</hi> And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell doe moſt plainely referre not onely meane Clergie men, but euen the Biſhops themſelues to their Metropolitans. For buſineſſes are beſt ended in the places where they are, neither is the grace of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> wanting vnto any Prouince. Let this equitie be wiſely obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and conſtantly maintained by the Miniſters of CHRIST.</p>
               <p n="35">35 <hi>Eleutherius, Biſhop of Rome</hi> writeth to <hi>Lucius King of Britannie</hi> much better, and more appoſitely to our preſent purpoſe. You haue (ſaith he) deſired, that wee ſhould ſend you the lawes of the Romans, and of the Emperours, that you may make vſe of them in the kingdome of <hi>Britannie.</hi> Theſe lawes wee may abrogate when we will, but the lawes of <hi>God</hi> we cannot. You haue receiued (by <hi>God's</hi> mercie) into your kingdome of <hi>Britannie</hi> the law and faith of CHRIST; you haue there the Old and the New Teſtament: from them take, through the grace of <hi>God,</hi> lawes by a Councel of your owne king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and, <hi>God</hi> permitting you, inſtruct your kingdome of <hi>Britannie</hi> by them. For you are <hi>Gods</hi> Vicar in that kingdome; according to that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, The earth is the Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="36">36 What ſhould I ſay more? <hi>Victor, Biſhop of Rome</hi> held a prouinciall <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Rome: Iuſtinian the Emperor</hi> commandeth that Synods (if there were occaſion) ſhould be held in euery Prouince; proteſting to puniſh them, if they did not doe it. Euery prouince (ſaith <hi>Hierom)</hi> hath peculiar maners, and rites, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, which cannot be altered without a great deale of trouble. What ſhould I repeat thoſe old prouinciall Councels at <hi>Eliberis, Gangra, Laodicea, Ancyra, Antioch, Tyrus, Carthage, Mileuitum, Tholouſe,</hi> &amp; <hi>Burdeaux.</hi> This is no new inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Church of <hi>God</hi> was ſo gouerned before the Fathers met in the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen Councel: men did not preſently run to a general Councel. <hi>Trophilus</hi> held a prouinciall <hi>Councel</hi> in <hi>Palestina; Palmas</hi> in <hi>Pontus; Irenaeus</hi> in <hi>France; Bacchylus</hi> in <hi>Achaia, Origen</hi> againſt <hi>Berillus</hi> in <hi>Arabia.</hi> I omit many other National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels held in <hi>Africa, Aſia, Graecia, Egypt</hi> without any order from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> which Councels were godly, Orthodox, and Chriſtian. For Biſhops in thoſe times vpon the ſudden, if any occaſion had been offred, did prouide for the neceſſity of their Churches by a domeſticall Councell, and ſomtimes cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ayd from their neighbor Biſhops; ſo that they mutually helped one the other. Neither did Biſhops onely beleeue, that the cauſe of Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them, but euen Princes too. For to paſſe ouer <hi>Nabuchadnezar,</hi> who commanded vpon paine of death, that the name of the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould not be blaſphemed; to omit <hi>Dauid, Solomon, Ezekias, Ioſias,</hi> who partly built,
<pb n="862" facs="tcp:17208:441"/>
partly purged the Temple of the Lord, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> put downe Idolatrie without a Councell, and made a moſt ſeuere edict, that it ſhould be capitall to ſacrifice to Idols. <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> cauſed the Temples of the heathen Gods to bee pul'd to the very ground. <hi>Iouinian,</hi> ſo ſoone as he was created <hi>Emperour,</hi> made his firſt law for the reſtoring of baniſhed Chriſtians. <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> was wont to ſay, that hee had no leſſe care of Chriſtian Religion, then of his owne life. When <hi>Ioſua</hi> was made ruler of the people, he preſently receiued command concerning religion, and the worſhip of <hi>God.</hi> For Princes are nurſing Eathers of the Church, and keepers of both tables.
