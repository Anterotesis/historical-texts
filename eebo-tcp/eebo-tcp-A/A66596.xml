         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>

            <p>IT is <hi>Bernards</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bern. Ep. 91.</note> saying, <hi>Nemo esse
bonus plusquàm oporter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test;</hi>
There is not a man alive can
be better then he should be; and it is
without doubt he is not good, who would not be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
<hi>Ubi incipis nolle fieri melior, ibi etiam
desinis esse bonus;</hi> adding they be professedly
<hi>the children of the luke-warm,</hi> who say, We
will be no better then our Fathers: <hi>Nolumus esse
meliores quàm patres nostri;</hi> whereas men
are in Religion not to be stinted by any Antiquity,
but what is divine from God the Ancient of dayes.
<hi>The children of light</hi> be proficients, they reach
forward, their spark comes to be a coale, their coale
a most vehement flame; God hath kindled in your
<pb facs="tcp:93618:3"/>
breast an ardent love to the house of God, <hi>your
zeale provokes many,</hi> your zeale makes many a
glad heart, your zeale honours God, who hath put
honour upon you: For them that honour him, he will
honour. Your present employment in the honourable
House of Commons in Parliament, cals for zeale:
It is a fire, 1. Active, to set all on work, the hand,
the tongue, the head, the heart. 2. Quick, speedy;
it is an utter enemy of delayes in its work. 3. Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
it bestoweth the top of affection, and strength
of intentions on what it loves. 4. Aspiring; it is the
highest element, mounts up nearer heaven, nearer
the Lord. Anciently, they who published Books
were wont to honor Personages with the patronage of
that, which they found them to be lovers or professors
of; To whom then may this present word of zeale
<hi>(which once you heard with patience)</hi> be
Dedicated more properly, then unto you? Whose
abilities in conjunction with zeale, graced with
magnanimity, and modesty, render you amiable to
all that know you, and honourable in mindes that
heare of you. I humbly pray your acceptance of this
my memorizing your zeale for Zion; You reade not
here swelling words of vanity, my study was to be not
plausible but profitable; <hi>Nos autem qui rerum

               <note n="z" place="margin">Ps. 119. 139.</note> consumed you;
for I have seen God in you, yet I have a greater bond
of deeper acknowledgement of your zeale, then your
many favours to me-ward amount unto, which is the
faithful discharge of that place the Country hath most
worthily put upon you, and intrusted you withall;
wherein your forwardnesse for the good of the
Church (the welfare whereof is above my chiefe joy)
hath been to my comfort, hath warmed many a heart,
and hath occasioned thanksgiving by many unto
God. The fruit of true wisdome is credit and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<hi>Eccl. 8. 1.</hi> A mans wisdome makes his face to
shine, and the boldnesse of his face shall be changed,
as faultlesse and fearlesse. Adorn your personall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies
with the true fear of God, a wise mans trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
a zealous forwardnesse for Gods glory, goodnes,
and good causes, whereby your publique imployment
may be blessed: Keep good conscience, the dearest
jewell your heart can have in it; Hold a constant
<pb facs="tcp:93618:4"/>
countermotion to the course of the world; minde the
life of grace as that which farre excels all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
of nature, art, or policy, that it animates
and ennobles them. What you doe for God, doe it by
his Word, all Laws are to be rectified by Gods Law,
men must set their Watch by the Dyall, and the
Dyall by the Sun. This way the more you labour, the
more rest will you finde. Thus with my unfained
prayers to the God of all grace,<note place="margin">1. Thess. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>That he may esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
