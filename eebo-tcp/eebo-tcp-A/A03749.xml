            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> of the match.</head>
               <p>All matches in mariages whilke promise good successe and continuance of concord, are ioyned in the feare of God, and coupled by sincere loue, the true &amp; onely knot of good agreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>t, whilke loue is engendred by the eye and by the eare, &amp; cannot be perfect, vnlesse both senses be satisfied in either partie: whilke eye liking in them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, for that neither of them hath seene the other. Now let vs way, whether sinceritie of loue be the maker of this match.</p>
               <p>First for degrees sake let vs begin with the Queene. Is it likely that the Q. of Scots, that could not like of Derley, should like well of the Duke, such as know them both do thinke very vnlikely.</p>
               <p>Now to the Duke. Is it likely that any man that professeth true religion<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> or resp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Then must it needes follow, that neither the eye in hur, if the Painter hath discharged his dutie, for other eye lyking
<pb facs="tcp:4452:3"/>
hath not passed betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, nor the eare in him is conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ted, but that some other respect should be the knitter of the knot: whilke respect carieth in it selfe manifest presumption of euident dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ger.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A consideration of the present state.</head>
               <p>Touching religion for lacke of doctrine, it is thought that the realme deuided into three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, two of them bee inclined so Papistrie and Atheisme.</p>
               <p>Touching gouernment such hath bene the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of our Soueraigne, a thing very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mendable in a prince, if our corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> abused not the same, as men for the most part are growen so remisse in dutie toward her maiesty, as they both contemne lawes, &amp; inferior magistrates. I leaue to descend into some other perticularities in this behalfe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A discourse vpon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd considerations.</head>
               <p>NOw let vs see vpon the consideration had of either of the persons, and of the match, and of the present state, what likelyhoode there is of continuance of Religion, and safetie to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne. And first let vs resort to the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration had of her person, &amp; begin with religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4452:4"/>Is it likely that the Gospe<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> shall all haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance by her, who is enemie to the Gospell, and ioyned in league and confederacie with the coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red repugners of the same?</p>
               <p>It may be said, that in Religion by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion she may be altered. It may well be answered that it is onelye Gods office to incline hartes to true religion, and that otherwise to thinke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of vaine presumption. Surely, if we way her inclination by the experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce had of the frutes of her behauiour, we shall see small cause to hope that sincere religion can dwell in so corruptible a vessell: Then in reason consider further how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely it is that vpon consideration of the present state, she finding two partes of this Realme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to her religion, where shee thinketh to haue a great partie, will alter the same, to ioyne with the fewer in number.</p>
               <p>Now as touching our Soueraignes safetie, is it like that our Soueraignes safety should be grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded and depended vpon her, who hath disciphred her selfe to be our competitor of this Realme? I speake of things publikely knowen. I leaue other secret prastises tending to the same end.</p>
               <p>It may be said, that so that the Q. can be brought to like of the match, and to restore her to her kingdome, and stablish her in the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, she will by othe and subscription confirme any thing that may tend to the Queenes safety.
<pb facs="tcp:4452:4"/>
If she falsifie her faith, no pleading will serue, the sword must be the remedie.</p>
               <p>But how like is it, that one ambitious, a borne Scot, a defamed person, who hath made shipwracke of all honour and reputation, &amp; last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a braunch of the house of Guise, whose professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> is to kepe none Edict neuer so solemnly promised, will kepe faith? I leaue it to the consideration of those that iudge without affection.</p>
               <p>Now hauing shewed how vnlikely it is that any safetie to our Soueraigne, or continuance in religion can grow by her person in this match, let vs see whether the desertes in her are likely to be supplied by the consideration of his person. And first wil we come to the weighing of his religion<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> which hauing shewed to bee vnsetled by sandrye reasons of good moment, let vs now see, whether by this match there is not like to ensue an euident and vndoubted daunger of his reuolt. And for proofe hereof, let the onelye example of Salomon teache vs so to thinke. Did not he by matching with an idolatresse Aegyptian, become an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherby ensued to him Gods high displeasure, to the great plague of his kin and posteritie?</p>
               <p>If wisedome might haue stayed hym, hee was likest to haue bene stayed, for he was of all that euer was the wisest. But when wysedome passeth the bondes of Gods commaundementes, it turneth to folly. That lawe which forbad Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
<pb facs="tcp:4452:5"/>
to marry with the Aegyptian idolatresse, standeth in force stil, &amp; forbiddeth the Duke to mary with the Scottish idolatresse, least that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which fell vpon Salomons kinne, teach the Duke to beware of like punishment. But let vs go further in applying.</p>
               <p>Salomon maried one meaner witted then him selfe: but the Duke woulde marry one equall in wit, and in subtiltie superior. To conclude, if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon marying one in degree his inferior, and in wit meaner, became an idolater: what shall we then looke for of him, that in degree is inferior, and in wit rather meaner then equall with hur, whom he seeketh to mary? But well, suppose he will continue constant: is all the daunger gone? No: For if either she mislike him, which is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that she can hardly loue him, hauyng to delicate an eye: or if that she ouerrule him, for that he is her inferior, whilke is not vnlikely, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering her courage: or if he die, a thing to bee thought of, for that hee is mortall: or if his lyfe be taken from him by indirect meanes, a practise wherwith she is right well acquainted, and by a Pope may be dispenced withall: what shall then become of the continuance in Religion?</p>
               <p>Now let vs see further what safety may grow to our Soueraigne by his matching with her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the consideration of his person, I shewed how that by calling in birth hee was honorable,
<pb facs="tcp:4452:5"/>
and of credite great, with both Nobility &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which two qualities as they are good gifts of God, and such as being well emplode by hym whom God hath indued withall, yelde no small benefite to the common wealth and Prince wher he liueth, so on the other side, beyng abused tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ambition, they brede to the Prince daunger<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and to the common wealth disquietnes.</p>
            </div>

               <head>Now let vs see what doubt groweth by this match of the abuse of the said qualities.</head>
               <p>FIrst, the match it selfe not grounded in the feare of God, nor vpon due respect, as afore was shewed, can neuer yelde good fruites, but must needes taste of ambition, of all other the most daungerous fruite.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the partie her selfe whom he is to match withall, hauyng shewed her selfe once a Competitor of this Crowne, is like to drawe hym from the due consideration of his allegiances by her cunning perswasions wherin she excelleth. To abuse the sayde qualities in attempting the sayde crowne for the thirst of a kingdome, can neuer be quenched, vntill it hath hazarded the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most triall.</p>
               <p>It may be obiected that by diuers capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that mischiefe may be well preuented.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4452:6"/>It may be well aunswered, that such as with simple eye weigh her fauorers in respecte of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, his friendes in respect of calling, alliance, and popular familiaritie, and therewith the eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of foraine practises, maye well see no bond sufficient to bridle so incorrigible an humor as ambition is.</p>
               <p>These thinges well wayed with the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this present state, how litle awe raigneth commonly, through the lenitie of our Soueraigne, in the hartes of the subiectes, whereby they may the more easilye be seduced by practises, be drawen from the consideration of their dutie, it must needes appeare that the home match ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in it selfe most euidnt daunger.</p>
               <p>I leaue to Lawyers to define of what quantie this presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> is, for a subiect to seeke to match with a Competor of this Crowne, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Soueraigne first priuie thereof.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>A comparison betwene the home match and the foreine.</head>
               <p>HAuing shewed the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ger of this home match let vs now consider with the forein match, &amp; see whilke of them yeldeth most daunger.</p>
               <p>If she marry a foreine Prince, her partie here within the Realme will not bee great, for
<pb facs="tcp:4452:6"/>
hardlye is an Englishman brought to like of a Straunger or a foraine gouernour, then must her meanes to annoy vs, consiste in foreine ayde, whilke though it be daungerous, yet doth it not yelde like daunger to the home enemie. For one enemie within a Citie besieged, is more daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, then a hundreth abroad.</p>
               <p>If she mary a foreine Prince, as for example with Fraunce, then will Spaine be ielous, for it wer contrary to the Spanish policie to see Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ce and England vnited vnder one gouernor. And therefore England might looke for any Spanishe aide, to keepe Fraunce from this purpose.</p>
               <p>But if she mary at home, whereby the ielo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of these two Princes may be taken away, then they both in respect of that league wherein she is ioyned with them, and the desire they haue to disquiet this estate, will ioyne together in ayding of her. And so besides her home helpe, she should lacke no foreine ayde. By this short comparison, euidentlye you maye see the home matche more daungerous, then the foreine, as well in respect of the continuance of Religion, as of the safetie of our Soueraigne.</p>
               <p>God be thanked that hath so prouided for the continuance of our Religion, as he hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs a Prince that fauoureth Religion, &amp; that we nede not seeke no further stay at her handes, who is enemie to Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4452:7"/>God also be thanked, that hath so prouided for her Maiesties safetie, as she hath no neede of this new found remedie.</p>
               <p>Touching the other respect of this home match, which is the vniting of England and Scotland, if we looke well vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the vniters with a single eye, that leaueth the continuance of Gods glory, and the safetie of our Soueraigne, and the quietnes of this state, wee shall see more profite in diuision, then in vnion.</p>
               <p>Notwithstandyng, it hath pleased God in this behalfe so fauourablye to deale wyth our Queeene, as he hath raysed vp in Scotlande a Gouernour during the noneage of the yong king, so faithfullye inclining to her Maiestie, as of no subiecte in this Realme shee maye dispose more of them, then of him: whereby during his Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment she may assure her selfe of most perfect vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God graunt that she may make that accompt of him, that he deserueth.</p>
               <p>Thus ye see the Queene in safetie, the two Realmes vnited, and this remedy nedeles.</p>
               <p>God graunt her Maiestie maye seeke the aduauncement of Gods glory in simple sinceritie, execute her lawes with conuenient seueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and then no doubt of it, he will blesse her with long and assured safetie.</p>
