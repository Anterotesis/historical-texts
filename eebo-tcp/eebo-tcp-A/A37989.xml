         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WHAT I had prepared for the Publick
View concerning the <hi>Authority, Stile,</hi>
and <hi>Perfection</hi> of Scripture I intended
to have Published together in one Volume; but
finding that the Present Age is not for <hi>Great
Books,</hi> I am content to comply with it so f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r;
especially perceiving the First Part of this my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
to swell into a moderate <hi>Octavo,</hi> I am
willing it should go into the World alon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
accordingly I now Publish that First P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rt only,
intending to treat of the <hi>Stile</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of
Scripture either in one or two Volumes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
The whole Attempt is of near A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>inity
with my fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

on several Texts of Scripture, especially such
as are <hi>Difficult,</hi> and giving the Resolution of them.
I have all along, whilst I have mention'd s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Passages of Holy Writ (to which the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
or Practises of the <hi>Pagans</hi> refer) given an
<hi>Explication</hi> generally of them; So that I am still
in pursuit of my former D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sign, and I make it
my Business to clear and illustrate the <hi>Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi>
especially that part of them which is most
Obscure and Difficult. But the <hi>more particular</hi>
Design of these Papers is to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t the <hi>Truth and
Authority</hi> of those Ancient and Divine Writings.
<pb facs="tcp:46315:4"/>
and that from the Testimonies of our professed
Adversaries, <hi>viz. Pagans</hi> and <hi>Iews.</hi> It were
folly to deny that divers of these things are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in other Authors, and partly to the same
purpose that I have produced them, (as indeed
what useful Subject is there that hath escaped the
Pens of the Learned?) but then it will be fitting
(if not necessary) for me to add, in a just Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of my present Attempt, that so far as
I have conversed with Writers, I never met with
any that Traced this Noble Subject, both through
the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New-Testament,</hi> which is the Design
of this present Work. I know some have hinted
at a few of these Remarks, and most commonly
without insisting on the Reasons and Grounds
of them, and without examining the particular
Circumstances belonging to them. But I have
not contented my self with this superficial way of
delivering these things, but have endeavoured to
Search into the true and genuine Original of
them, which hath occasioned several Just Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,
and enlarged Disquisitions on the various
Matters which occur under those Heads. In
brief, I have amply prosecuted this Argument by
offering a vast number of Particulars from my
own Enquiry and Observation: I have <hi>designedly</hi>
Treated on this Theme, which scarce any have
done: I have methodically digested my Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
according to the Histories, or other Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in the <hi>Bible,</hi> to which they have reference in
<hi>Iewish</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> Writers: And Lastly, I have
made the whole Serviceable to this excellent Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
<hi>viz.</hi> the attesting and confirming the <hi>Truth</hi>
of the Sacred Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>But the main of this <hi>Preface</hi> shall be spent in
vindicating my Interpretation of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29.
<pb facs="tcp:46315:4"/>
In my former <hi>Enquiry</hi> into that Text, where I
maintained that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (which
our Translators rende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Baptized for the Dead)</hi> is
according to the tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and proper Signification of
the Words in that place to be Translated <hi>Baptized
on the Account,</hi> or <hi>by reason of,</hi> or <hi>for the sake of the
Dead.</hi> Which Interpretation, I perceive, some
are backward to entertain, because they doubt
whether the Preposition <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> join'd with a Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Case, be taken in that sense in Prophane
Authors. They grant it is Equivalent with the
Latin <hi>causâ, gratiâ,</hi> or <hi>in gratiam,</hi> but they think
that these, and consequently the Greek Preposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
always refer to, and denote some <hi>Advantage</hi>
or <hi>Benefit:</hi> Therefore according to these Persons
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> should rather be rendred <hi>for the benefit
of the Dead,</hi> because this is the Acception of the
Preposition in the Writings of all Prophane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
But to this I might reply, and that with
most justifiable Reason, that I am not obliged to
prove that this Preposition is used in <hi>Pagan</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the same Sense that I assert it to be used
in this place of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Who knows not that
some Authors have a particular and individual
Sense of some Words appropriated to themselves,
and it is in vain to look for the same Acception
of them in other Writers? The Commentators
on <hi>Homer, Aristophanes, Herodotus,</hi> or any other
good Greek or Latin Author, take notice that
such a Word or Phrase is used by these Writers in
a Sense different from what is found in others;
and this is Satisfactory to the Learned. But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if they find that one of these Authors useth
the same word more than once in this peculiar
Sense, they are confirmed in the belief of this
singular meaning of it. So it should be here;
<pb facs="tcp:46315:5"/>
for this is certain, that the Authority of the <hi>New-Testament</hi>
is every whit as good as that of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
Authors, or any other. Any fair Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
will readily grant, that if I produce two or
three places in the <hi>New-Testament</hi> where the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> hath the Signification which I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix
to it, I perform my Task well enough. And
this I have already done in my <hi>Enquiry</hi> into that
Text, where more than the fore-named num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of places is brought to confirm that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Sense of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which I have propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
I could have mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. and
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. and other Texts made use of by
<hi>Grotius,</hi> where he thinks <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is to be
rendred, [<hi>by reason of,</hi> or <hi>because of,</hi> or <hi>on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our Sins,</hi>] for our Sins were the proper
<hi>Impulsive meritorious Cause</hi> of Christ's Death;
though we must not exclude the <hi>Final Cause,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he suffered to take away our Sins. And
<hi>Vossius</hi> goes something higher, who assures us that
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

and join'd with <hi>Suffering</hi> or <hi>Punishing</hi> whether in
Scripture or any other good Author always sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the <hi>Antecedent or meritorious Cause,</hi> but never
the <hi>Final:</hi> And I verily believe that <hi>Vossius</hi> was
as good a Grammar-Scholar as <hi>Socinus,</hi> whom
he opposeth in this particular. There are
other Texts which I might have produced, as
<hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 4. this Sickness is <gap reason="foreign">

an impulsive Cause. And perhaps that
place, 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
so. It is sufficient then to have proved
that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is used in several places of the <hi>New-Testament</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:46315:5"/>
in the Sense before-named, <hi>i. e.</hi> that it
is as much as [on the account] or [because
of] or [for the sake] that it signifies some <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Account,</hi> or <hi>Motive,</hi> why a Man should do
such a thing. We need not search into other
Authors to find whether this be the import of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
among them; this is not requisite, for the <hi>New-Testament</hi>
is able to vouch it self.</p>
                  <p>But though to prove this Sense of the Preposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Classical Authors be more than I need to
do, yet for the Satisfaction of the Scrupulous, for
Vindicating my Interpretation of that Text, and
for the Establishing it beyond all Exceptions for
the future, I will shew that this very signification
of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (and that with a word in the Genitive
Case) is not uncommon in the <hi>Pagan</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ile; and
particularly I will make it evident that it hath
not always a reference to a <hi>Benefit,</hi> as some think.
For Proof of this I might send you to <hi>Stephens</hi>'s
<hi>Thesaurus</hi> where in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> he produces
some Passages out of <hi>Herodian, Demonsthenes,</hi> and
(as I remember) <hi>Plutarch,</hi> which do in some
measure evince the foresaid Acception of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position;
and out of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Sixth <hi>Iliad</hi> he hath a
a plain place,

                     </gap> by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and 'tis as much, he saith, as
<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>because of thee,</hi> or <hi>on thy account.</hi> But
whether this be the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in this place
it is not so much material as that we need con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert
<pb facs="tcp:46315:6"/>
it; but this is sufficient for my purpose
that this famous Commentator who understood
<hi>Greek</hi> so well, acquaints us, that the Signification
of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is sometimes as much as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, yea when
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> doth not signifie or imply a <hi>Benefit,</hi> as is clear
in this place; for these words of <hi>Hector</hi> cannot
possibly be carried to any such Sense; that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable.
Wherefore their Fancy falls to the
ground who think the meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is
[for the benefit or emolument of such a one].</p>
                  <p>I have something yet more to prove, (and that
even from <hi>Pagan</hi> Authority) which is this, that
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> frequently imports an <hi>impulsive Cause,</hi> and
that directly and plainly, and that it ought to be
translated [on the account, by reason of, because
of] To evince this, I will choose out an Author
against whom there can be no Exception, I mean
<hi>Isocrates,</hi> whose Writings are famed for their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety

Common Safety excited them to do what they

must make it evident that the <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> are True, before we can receive any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Benefit from them. There is a Necessity
of evidencing the <hi>Truth of the Scriptures,</hi> which are
this Covenant, and this Testament; otherwise we
can build nothing upon them.</p>
                     <p>Here then,
<list>
                           <item>I. I will evince the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the
Scriptures, which is the great Basis of all
Theology.</item>
                           <item>II. After I have largely insisted on this, I will
proceed to give you an account of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Stile</hi> and <hi>Phrase</hi> of these Holy
Books.</item>
                           <item>III. I will advance yet farther, and demonstrate
the <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of them.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Subject of our present Undertaking is the
first of these: in handling of which I shall but
briefly and concisely make use of those Arguments
which are commonly insisted upon by Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
till I come to fix upon a Topick, which is not
commonly, yea, which is very rarely and by the by
used in this Cause; and this I will pursue very
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46315:11"/>
largely and fully, I hope with some Satisfaction to
the Reader. There are many Arguments to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the Holy
Scriptures, and shew that they are worthy to be
believed and imbraced by us as the very Word of
God. Some of these Arguments which are to
prove the Truth of these Writings, are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with those that prove the <hi>Truth of the Christian
Religion,</hi> on which I shall have occasion to insist at
another time: but my Design at present is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
those which are more <hi>peculiarly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi>
fitted to evince <hi>the Truth of the Scriptures.</hi> And
these are either <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>External.</hi> The <hi>Internal</hi>
ones I call those which are either <hi>in the Scriptures
themselves,</hi> or <hi>in Vs.</hi> The Characters of Divinity
which the Scriptures have in <hi>Themselves,</hi> are either
their <hi>Matter,</hi> or the <hi>Manner</hi> of the writing them.</p>
                     <p>I begin with the first, the <hi>Matter</hi> of them: and
here I will mention only these three Particulars.</p>
                     <p>1. The Sublime Doctrines and Verities which
are in Holy Writ. In reading this Book we meet
with such things as cannot reasonably be thought
to come from any but God himself. In other
Writings which are most applauded, the choicest
things which entertain our Minds, are the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Moral Notions and Precepts which they offer
to us, which are all the Result of Improved Reason
and Natural Religion. But here are (besides these)
Notices of a peculiar Nature, and such as are above
our natural Capacity and Invention, as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World (in that Manner as is represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us in these Writings), the Doctrine of the
Holy Trinity, the Eternal Decrees, the Incarnation
of Christ the Son of God, the Redemption of the
World by his Blood, the whole Method of Man's
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46315:11"/>
Salvation, the stupendous Providence of God over
his Church in all Ages, the Coming of Christ to
Judgment, and (in order to that) the raising of
all Men out of their Ashes. These and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Doctrines deliver'd in the Sacred Writings,
cannot be imagined to come from any but God;
they carry with them the Character of Divinity,
as being no common and obvious Matters, but such
as are towring and lofty, hidden and abstruse, and
not likely to be the Product of Humane Wisdom.
A God is plainly discovered in them, for the most
Improved Creatures could never have reach'd to
this pitch. Any serious and thinking Man cannot
but discern the peculiar Turn and singular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of these Mysterious Doctrines, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
them to be Divine. We may therefore believe
the Writings of the Prophets and Apostles to be
the Word of God, because of the wonderful Height
and Sublimity of those Truths which are contained
in them.</p>
                     <p>2. The Exact Purity and Holiness both of Body
and Soul, of Heart and Life, which are enjoin'd
in these Writings, are another Testimony of their
being Divinely Inspired. For though some other
Books dictate Religion and Piety, yet this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that all the true and just Measures of them
were taken originally from this one Exact Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard,
which was prior to them all, as I shall shew
afterwards. Besides, the Love and Charity, the
Humility, Meekness, and all other Vertues which
the Scriptures describe to us, far exceed the most
advantageous Representations, the most exalted
Ideas which the Heathen Moralists give of them.
These therefore are emphatically and eminently
called by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.
15. because they breath the most consummate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46315:12"/>
Goodness and Piety, and that antecedently to all
Writings whatsoever: because every thing in them
advanceth Holiness, and that in Thought, Word
and Actions. The End and Scope of them are to
promote<note n="*" place="bottom">

                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Clem. Alex. in Protrept.</note> Sanctity of Life, to make us every way
better, and even to render us * like God himself.
The Holy Scripture was intended to set forth the
Divine Perfections, to display the Heavenly Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and thereby to commend the Excellency of a
holy Life. And it is certain, that if with sincere
and humble Minds we peruse this Book of God, we
shall find this blessed Result of it, it will marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
instruct us in the Knowledg of the Divine
Attributes, especially of God's Unspotted Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
it will tincture our Minds with Religion, it
will pervade all our Faculties with a Spirit of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
and it will thorowly cleanse and sanctify
both our Hearts and Lives, which proves it to be
from God. But because I shall have occasion to
say more of this, when I treat of the <hi>Perfection of
the Scriptures,</hi> I will now dismiss it.</p>
                     <p>3. To the <hi>Matter</hi> of Scripture we must refer
the <hi>Prophecios</hi> and <hi>Predictions</hi> which are contained
in it. These I reckon another <hi>Internal Argument,</hi>
because they are drawn from what is comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the very Scripture it self. What a vast
number is there of Prophecies of the Old and New
Testament, which we find <hi>fulfilled,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
are Testimonies of the Truth of these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?

the Second Chief Monarchy, <hi>viz.</hi> the Persian,
was honourably named and foretold by <hi>Isaiah</hi> to
be the Deliverer of the Jews out of their Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Restorer of their Temple, almost two
hundred Years before he was born, and before that
Deliverance was accomplished; <hi>Isa.</hi> 44. 28. and
45. 1—-5. This is that <hi>Cyrus</hi> who conquered
<hi>Astyages</hi> the last King of the Medes, and translated
the Empire to the Persians, and brought <hi>Asia</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46315:13"/>
all the East under his Power. This is that <hi>Cyrus</hi>
whose Life <hi>Xenophon</hi> wrote, saith Sir <hi>W. Raleigh:</hi>
and from some things there related, especially his
last Oration at his Death, we may probably gather
that he received the Knowledg of the True God
from <hi>Daniel</hi> when he govern'd <hi>Susa</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> and
that he had read <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s Prophecy wherein he was
expresly named. And indeed<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiqu. 1. 11. c. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us
that he had so; and that when the Jews shewed
<hi>Cyrus</hi> that Place of Scripture which foretold his
Wars and Victory, and likewise his Beneficence to
the Jews, he admired the Divinity of the Book;
and to make good what he read, he conferr'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great Kindnesses on that People. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
therefore, saith a<note n="†" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Jackson.</note> Judicious Writer, that
the History of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Life wrote by the foresaid
Historian, is thought by some to be a Fiction, he
being so Extraordinary a Person, designed by God,
and signally foretold before-hand. An extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Spirit and Vigor actuated him, which makes
that Historical Account of him look like a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.
But notwithstanding what these Learned
Men say, I am doubtful whether this famous <hi>Cyrus</hi>
whom I am now speaking of, was he that this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian gives us an account of; for that <hi>Cyrus</hi>
whom he describes, died a Natural Death, and
expired peaceably on his Bed, and among his
Friends; but this <hi>Cyrus</hi> that set up the Persian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
died in the Wars, and was overcome by
<hi>Tomyris</hi> Queen of the Scythians. Therefore 'tis
thought by others, that the Life of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is described by <hi>Xenophon.</hi> To proceed, the
taking of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and its being brought under the
Power of the Medes and Persians, were predicted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46315:13"/>
by <hi>Isaiah</hi> many Years before they came to pass,
<hi>Isa. 47. 1, &amp;c.</hi> And this Noble Prophet hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
gain'd the Title of <hi>Evangelical,</hi> because
he so exactly sets down what happened several hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years afterwards upon the Arrival of Christ,
and the Dispensation of the Gospel. <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
(another noted Prophet) prefixed the seventy
Years of the Babylonian Captivity: And in other
Prophets, who were Pen-men of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there are very plain Predictions of future
Events; and the Accomplishment of them hath
proved them to be True. But the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
is most eminent and wonderful in <hi>Daniel,</hi>
who hath foretold the State of the World from
the time of the Captivity, wherein he lived, till
the Coming of Christ in the Flesh, which was about
five hundred Years after. The Succession of the
most famous <hi>Empires</hi> or <hi>Monarchies</hi> of the World,
is prophetically represented by him in his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of<note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Dream. There
(as St. <hi>Ierom</hi> saith) he shews that he<note n="†" place="bottom">Temporum conscius, &amp; totius Mundi. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhistor. Epist. ad Paulin.</hi>

the various History of the whole World. There
you will see the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Greek
and Roman Monarchies decipher'd by the four
known Metals, Gold, Silver, Brass, and Iron. <hi>The
Head of Gold</hi> is the Assyrian or Babylonian Empire,
which was the First and Richest Monarchy, and
was the Beginning and Head of the rest which
were to follow. <hi>The Breast and Arms of Silver</hi> are
the Medo-Persian Empire; which because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of two People, it is therefore fitly set forth
by <hi>two Arms. Belly and Thighs of Brass</hi> are the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46315:14"/>
Greek Empire; which because it was chiefly divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

is not unfitly set forth by <hi>two Legs.</hi> Its <hi>Feet</hi> are
said to be <hi>partly Iron and partly Clay,</hi> because being
divided, it was not all of a piece, but was of a
different Nature: they could no more unite and
cement, than Iron and Clay. Then you read of
<hi>a Stone cut out without Hands,</hi> i. e. the Lord <hi>Christ,</hi>
not born after the ordinary and humane way. This
Stone was first visible <hi>in the Days of those Kings,</hi> ver.
44. <hi>i. e.</hi> the Kings that make up the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:
for then Christ was born, then Christianity
was first set up. <hi>This Stone shall become a great
Mountain, and fill the whole Earth,</hi> ver. 35. and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Gold, Silver, Brass and Iron, <hi>i. e.</hi> put
an end to these Empires. Christ and his Church
shall constitute another, <hi>viz.</hi> a Fifth Empire, much
more Glorious and Renowned than the former
ones. This famous Prophecy, of above two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years date, was in a signal manner verified at
the Coming of Christ, the King of Kings, and
Lord of Lords; and it shall have a further Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
when the Christian Religion shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
anew in the remote Parts of the World,
and at last shall become the Religion of the whole
World, and a Glorious Church shall be establish'd
on the Earth.</p>
                     <p>In the seventh Chapter of this Prophecy you
have the Vision of the <hi>Four Beasts,</hi> which foretells
the very same which was represented by the <hi>Four
Metals,</hi> but more particularly and largely. First
there is the <hi>Lion, i. e.</hi> the Assyrian Monarchy,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46315:14"/>
which hath <hi>two Wings,</hi> which denote the two part
of that Empire, <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Assyria.</hi> They are
said to be <hi>plucked, i. e.</hi> shattered and destroyed,
as we read they were by <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Cyrus.</hi> This
<hi>Lion</hi> is the same with the <hi>Golden Head</hi> in <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>'s
Dream. Next comes the <hi>Bear,</hi> which is
the Persian Monarchy set up by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
by <hi>Ninus</hi>) and expired in <hi>Darius,</hi> whom <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
the Great slew in Battel. The <hi>three Ribs in
its Mouth,</hi> are the three Chief Emperours or Kings
of this Monarchy, namely, <hi>Cyrus, Darius, Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes,</hi>
who <hi>devoured much Flesh,</hi> i. e. added many
Nations to their Monarchy. Or <hi>the three Ribs</hi> may
signify the <hi>Persian</hi> Kingdom, which had united to
it the <hi>Medes,</hi> and the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Power and People,
and so was composed of <hi>three.</hi> This is the same
with <hi>the Breast and Arms of Silver</hi> in the foregoing
Dream. The next thing in the Vision is a <hi>Panther</hi>
or <hi>Leopard,</hi> with <hi>four Wings and Heads;</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the Greek Empire, with the principal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
or Satrapies which after <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Death
arose out of that Monarchy, <hi>viz.</hi> those of <hi>Seleucus</hi>
King of <hi>Syria, Antigonus</hi> King of the Lesser <hi>Asia,
Cassander</hi> King of <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
The <hi>four Wings</hi> also signify the Swiftness of
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s Conquests, and also the speedy Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his Empire into four Kingdoms. This is
the same with the <hi>Brazen Belly</hi> in the preceding
Dream. Lastly there appears a <hi>Beast with ten
Horns,</hi> which is the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> though I know
some interpret this Fourth Beast of the <hi>Asiatick
Monarchy,</hi> called by Historians the <hi>Regnum Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darum,</hi>
or those several lesser Kingdoms which set
up upon the breaking of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Monarchy.
The <hi>ten Horns are ten Kings,</hi> as is plain from the
express Words in the <hi>24th</hi> Verse; and these (say
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46315:15"/>
they) are <hi>Seleucus Nicanor, Antiochus Soter, Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus
Theos,</hi> another <hi>Seleucus, Ptolomaeus Euergetes,</hi>
a third <hi>Seleucus, Antiochus, Ptolomaeus Philopator,
Seleucus Philopator, Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> And the
<hi>little Horn</hi> mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 8. is, say they, the last
of these ten. Others are of opinion that <hi>the little
Horn</hi> that came up among the ten Horns, is the
<hi>Mahometan</hi> or <hi>Turkish Empire,</hi> which grew out of
the Roman Monarchy, or those Territories which
were possessed by the Romans: and the three Horns
it hath seized on, are three Parts of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
<hi>viz. Asia, Egypt, Greece.</hi> But to unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
Minds it will rather appear, that this part of
the Vision which speaks of the <hi>Fourth Beast,</hi> and
the <hi>Little Horn,</hi> belongs to the Roman Empire:
for this Vision is but an enlarging on the Dream of
the <hi>four Metals</hi> before spoken of. And yet I will
grant that this Prophetick Vision may be taken
with some Latitude, as many of the Prophecies of
the Old and New Testament (as I shall shew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
are to be taken: and so <hi>Antiochus Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
and <hi>Mahomet</hi> (the one the Scourge of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Church, the other of the Christian) may not
be excluded here, but after a Prophetick manner
implied; yet so as the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and what
was to happen in the World in those Dominions,
are chiefly and principally here meant. This is
the <hi>Beast with ten Horns,</hi> which are the ten Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
or Kingdoms belonging heretofore to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire, <hi>viz. Asia, Africa, Syria, Egypt, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
Spain, Greece, Gallia, Germany, Britain.</hi> This
Fourth Beast is the same with the <hi>Legs of Iron and
Clay,</hi> spoken of before. It is easy and obvious to
apply the Character of this last Beast to the Roman
Empire. <hi>It was dreadful and terrible, and strong ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly:
it had great Iron Teeth; it devoured and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46315:15"/>
brake in pieces, and stamped the Residue with the Feet
of it; and it was diverse from all the Beasts that were
before it,</hi> as you read in <hi>ver.</hi> 7. And again, <hi>ver. 23.
The fourth Beast shall be the fourth Kingdom upon
Earth, which shall be diverse from all Kingdoms, and
shall devour the whole Earth, and shall tread it down,
and break it in pieces.</hi> This is a most Graphical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation
of the Secular Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the
Slaughter and Ravage it hath made on the Earth.
It is farther added, that <hi>there came up among the
Horns another little Horn,</hi> ver. 8. that is, a Power
distinct from those ten Powers or Kingdoms before
mentioned. Here then perhaps is meant the
Church or Hierarchy of <hi>Rome</hi> distinct from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Power or ten Kings. This is <hi>Popery</hi> in the
most proper Sense, the Ecclesiastical and Spiritual
Dominion of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is distinguish'd from the
Civil or Temporal one: and it is the same with
the False <hi>Prophet</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20. How naturally
the Character of this <hi>Horn</hi> is appliable to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
may be seen in the following ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The eighth Chapter reacheth not so far, but
yet contains a very notable <hi>Prophecy,</hi> couched in
the Vision of a <hi>Ram</hi> and a <hi>He-Goat.</hi> The<note n="*" place="bottom">Ver. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Ram
with two Horns</hi> is (as is afterwards interpreted in

                        <hi>Kingdom of</hi> Media <hi>and</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia.
The <hi>He-Goat</hi> is the Greek Empire: the<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ver. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Horn between his Eyes,</hi> is <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great,
the first Greek Monarch, as you find it expresly
expounded in <hi>ver. 21. The rough Goat is the King</hi>
(or Kingdom) <hi>of</hi> Greece; <hi>and the great Horn that
is between his Eyes, is the first King.</hi> It is said,<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> 
                        <hi>he
touched not the Ground,</hi> i. e. he went on swiftly;
for in twelve Years he did all his Work, and in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46315:16"/>
three Battels he vanquish'd <hi>Darius,</hi> and succeeded
in his Monarchy. Thus <hi>he smote the Ram, and
brake his two Horns, and cast him to the Ground,</hi> ver.
7. It was above two hundred Years before this
was accomplished that <hi>Daniel</hi> here foretold, and
therefore it is a very considerable Prophecy, and
a very remarkable Proof of the Authority of this
Book. Hence it was that when <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great was on his march towards <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
it, <hi>Iaddus</hi> the High Priest went out to meet
him with the Book of <hi>Daniel</hi> in his Hand, which
he opened and shewed to that great Monarch, and
let him see this Place wherein his mighty Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Glory were foretold: Which very
thing diverted him from doing that Harm to the
Jews which he intended, and also made him confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in his Enterprizes against <hi>Persia,</hi> the Conquest
of which this Prophecy foretold. When <hi>this great
Horn was broken, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>our other notable ones came up in its
stead,</hi> v. 8. that is, on the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> there
sprang up these four Kingdoms, namely <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
Asia, Syria, Egypt: These stood up, but not in his
Power,</hi> ver. 22. <hi>i. e. Alexander</hi>'s; they were much
weaker and feebler, being divided. <hi>Out of one of
these Horns came forth a little one,</hi> ver. 9. who is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
called <hi>a King of fierce Countenance,</hi> ver.
23. This is <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> who came out of
the Syrian Horn: <hi>by him the daily Sacrifice was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, and the Place of the Sanctuary was cast
down,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>He destroyed wonderfully, and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
and practised, and destroyed the mighty and the
holy People,</hi> ver. 24. This and much more which
you read in this Chapter, can agree to no Person
so well as to that <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who plagued and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barass'd
all <hi>Syria,</hi> and miserably shock'd the Holy
Land, and with unspeakable Rage and Fury per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46315:16"/>
the People of it, and deprived them of
their Sacrifices, and defiled their Altars, and
spoiled their Temple the celebrated Place of their
Worship, and cruelly and barbarously put many
to death that refused to violate the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
At last it is said, <hi>he shall be broken without Hands;</hi>
which plainly signifies the sudden and unexpected
Catastrophe of him and his Army, which the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
History will particularly inform you of.</p>
                     <p>I will not particularly insist on the <hi>eleventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of the same Prophet, in the beginning of which
it is foretold concerning <hi>Xerxes,</hi> that <hi>by his Strength
through his Riches he should stir up all against the Realm
of</hi> Greece, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. which we read was punctually
fulfilled, for he entred <hi>Greece</hi> with an Army that
consisted of a Million of Men. And what is said
concerning <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
should be broken, and divided towards the four
Winds of Heaven, and not to his Posterity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 4.
we know was really accomplish'd. The rest of
the Chapter is a Prophetical History of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
of those several lesser Kings, among whom
the Grecian Monarchy after <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Death was
divided, especially of <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Great, and of
<hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> Here, as in the former Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
you may see many things foretold a long time
before they were fulfill'd; which is a certain and
undeniable Argument of the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Spirit in
the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>We might proceed to the Predictions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which we see also
are performed in great measure. Here was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
the wonderful Propagation of the Gospel,
the Rejection of it by the Jews, the Receiving of
it by the Gentiles, the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and all the Calamities of that Nation. These Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46315:17"/>
we know are accomplished. Besides, in
the Writings of the New Testament we read that
Christ foretold many things concerning himself
and his Followers, as the Scandal which his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
especially <hi>Peter,</hi> would give, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 31.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s triple Denial of him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 31. and yet
at the same time he foretold that it should not be
accompanied with a final falling away, <hi>ver.</hi> 32.
He foretold that he should be betrayed, and that
he should be mock'd and scourg'd, and at last cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisied;
and that the third Day he should rise again,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 17, 18, 19. And as he predicted his own
Death, the Place, Time and Kind of it, with the
time of his Resurrection, (and I might have added
also, of his Ascension, and of his sending the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost;) so he did the same as to the manner of
<note n="*" place="bottom">John 21. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Peter</hi>'s Death: and he foretold<note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist's
long Life. He told his Disciples what
should befal them after his Departure, what Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
and Sufferings they should meet with
for their professing the Gospel, and owning his Cause.
He acquainted them that the Gospel should be
preach'd throughout the whole World, that Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals
and Heresies should come into the Church,
that many should apostatize from the Faith, and
desert Christianity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. And the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
and Apostles, as well as our Saviour, from
that Spirit of <hi>Prophecy</hi> which was in them, foretold
sundry things which we see since are fulfilled. In
their Writings are Predictions concerning the
Calling of the Gentiles, the Conversion of the
Jews, the State of the Christian Church, the Rise
of Antichrist, his Character, his Progress, and his
dreadful Downfal, a great part of which is already
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46315:17"/>
fulfill'd. Much of the Fate of the World, which
they foretold, God hath brought to pass; which
gives us assurance that the rest will be accomplish'd
in due time. Yea, there are at this day Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
fulfill'd every hour, as that of the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
in her <hi>Magnificat, From henceforth all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
shall call me Blessed,</hi> Luke 1. 48. The Memory
of this holy Woman is daily celebrated in the
Christian Church, and her Name is blessed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the Assemblies of the Saints. They with
one accord rejoice, that of her was born the Holy
JESUS, who is Blessed for evermore. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
what <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> foretold of Christ, are
every day accomplished: some part of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
is at this very instant made good. That
is another Prophecy which is now fulfilling, 2 <hi>Tim.
3. 1. In the last Days perillous Times shall come, for
&amp;c.</hi> with several others that might be named, the
Accomplishment of which no unprejudiced Man,
and of common Ingenuity, will refuse to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg.
Now this wonderful <hi>Prophetick Spirit</hi> in
Scripture, is a strong Argument that these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
were inspired by God, and that the Matter
of them is Divine. For the foreknowing or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling
of things to come, is one Character of the
True God, as you read in <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 22, 23. From
thence it is evident that none can predict them,
unless he be immediately enlightned and taugh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of
God. The certain and infallible Knowledg of
future Contingences, which depend on free Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
is from Him alone. Wherefore when we see
(as in our present Case) that things were expresly
foretold several hundreds of Years before they
came to pass, and when we see that the Events ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
answer'd to the Predictions, we cannot but
acknowledg that these Predictions were from God,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46315:18"/>
and could not be from any else.</p>
                     <p>If it be objected, That other Writings beside<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
the Bible have <hi>Predictions</hi> in them, and that Men
of Skill and Sagacity do sometimes foretel Futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
yea, that those who have the least Converse
with God, those who deal with <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> have
predicted things to come; and therefore this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is of no force. I answer, first, It is true
that Natural Skill, especially improved by Art, by
Reason and Philosophy, and the knowledg of the
Laws of Nature, will give Men Insight into some
Futurities. For God hath impress'd a particular
Quality on Natural Bodies, and they keep a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Course. He hath fixed a way for his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to act in, and they never go out of it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
The Operations and Effects of Fire and
Water, of Gravity and Levity in Bodies; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sun and Moon, and the Eclipses of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the several Aspects of the Heavens, may
certainly be foretold: for they continually and
unerringly keep their Progress, unless God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
sometimes to cross their usual Course, as when
the Waters of the Red-Sea stood up on a heap
whilst the Israelites passed over; The Fire in <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>'s
Furnace was restrain'd from doing any
harm to those that were cast into it; the Sun stood
still in <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s time, and was retrograde in King
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> And so there are monstrous and misha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Creatures born into the World, which deviate
from the common Procedure of Nature. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
that God suffers his Creatures to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Laws of Nature, it is easy to make a
Judgment of them, and to foretel what shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.
But the things we are speaking of, and which
are foretold in the Holy Writings, are of another
kind; they are not fixed and determined by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46315:18"/>
and therefore 'tis not in Man's power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
their Events. Again, <hi>Physicians</hi> have their
<hi>Prognosticks</hi> whereby they foretel what will become
of the Patient, whether the Disease will be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cured, or easily, or not at all. But because
these Prognosticks are founded on a great many
<hi>Symptoms,</hi> and these are uncertain and dubious, it
follows that those are so likewise: though 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
an experienc'd Artist will see very far here.
Then as to future Occurrences in <hi>Bodies Politick,</hi> a
wise Man may by careful Observation and Remarks
on the Affairs of the World, gain some Insight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these; by being long exercis'd in Business, by
a large Experience of things, and by seeing what
hath been heretofore, he may gather what shall be
hereafter. A skilful <hi>Historian,</hi> who hath diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perused the Transactions of former Ages, and
digested the Methods of Government, and scann'd
the Manners and Customs of Countries, can do
this. But this Foresight of things to come is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
rather than Knowledg: for we can have no
certain Foreknowledg of what depends on the
Freewill of Man. Or if we will pretend to any
Measure of it, we must deal only in Generals: as
for Particular and Personal Events, they are far
beyond our reach. And as for the particular <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>
of them, especially if they be far off, there
is no Prospect at all of it. Or where the Causes
and Effects are Extraordinary and Preternatural,
there we must confess our utter Blindness and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance:
they are no more to be discerned by us,
than the Antartick Pole is to be seen by us in our
Hemisphere. We know not what such Events
will be; we are not able to foretel them of our
selves, they can be discovered by Revelation only.
And that is the Case which is now before us: the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46315:19"/>
Predictions which we read in Scripture, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those things which no humane Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Foresight could possibly attain to. To fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know
and foretel things that should happen to the
Jewish and Christian Church, two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years before they came to pass; to predict
the Deliverance of the Israelites from their Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> four hundred Years before it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
to mention <hi>Iasias</hi> and his Religious Acts three
hundred Years before he was born; to describe
the future Monarchies of the World, and some of
the most remarkable Passages belonging to them;
to foretel almost two hundred Years before-hand,
that there shall be such an Emperour as <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and
to particularize his Actions; these are such things
as no Wise Philosopher, no Learned Physician, no
Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>dent Statesman, no Prying Historian is able to
foresee and discover: for they are not general, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
particular and personal Events; they were at a
vast distance, and not near at hand: and the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Time of some of them was exactly assigned.
If we respect second Causes, they were such Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
as depended on the free Agency of Man:
and if we respect God, they were the mere Results
of his Arbitrary Will and Pleasure; they were
preternatural and unusual Events, and therefore it
was not within the compass of Man's Apprehension
to discover these things, the knowledg of them
could not be had without Divine Assistance. To
this alone then we must attribute the Prediction of
them. The omniscient Eye of Heaven only could
dive into these Secrets which were so far off; and
thence it is that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> (which are by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Revelation) have recorded them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is said in the <hi>Objection,</hi> that <hi>Evil
Spirits</hi> help some to the knowledg of future Events,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46315:19"/>
and therefore we cannot prove the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the
Scriptures from the <hi>Prophecies</hi> which are there, and
which are since fulfilled. I grant indeed that the
Devil help'd his Followers, or pretended to help
them to the knowledg of some future things. This
commenced into an Art among the old Greek and
Roman Pagans: <hi>Divination</hi> (which, as <hi>Tully</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
it, is a<note n="*" place="bottom">Earum rerum quae fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

Events) was a Science among them: and that
Men were very eager of knowing before-hand
what should happen, appears from the several
ways of Divining which they used. Their way of
foretelling was by observing the flight and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
the sitting and feeding of Birds, by Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
into the Entrails of these and other Animals
that were sacrificed. Some from the Aspects of
<hi>Stars</hi> pretended to presage what should happen:
and the Professors of this Art were in great Esteem
and Veneration. <hi>Dreams</hi> also were observ'd, and
strange Remarks made upon them. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted the <hi>Dead,</hi> calling up the departed Spirits,
and asking them concerning future Affairs. The
<hi>Oracles</hi> were another way of Divining, and were
the most celebrated of all. And many other kinds
of Divination and Soothsaying were in use with
the Pagan World: for they being mightily desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to be acquainted with things to come, and to
look into Futurities, ransack'd both Heaven and
Earth, and made use of all things above and below
to inform themselves about them. But all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
they received by these different ways of
Divining, was either Uncertain, or Casual, or
directly Diabolical. It was Uncertain, because it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46315:20"/>
was grounded on unsound Principles, on foolish
and precarious Observances, and consequently the
knowledg of Events was conjectural and fallible.
Wherefore the wisest and soberest Men among
the Pagans look'd upon it as no other: and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
'tis worth our notice that <hi>Tully,</hi> who is
full of Arguments for <hi>Divination</hi> in his first Book
on that Subject, hath as many against it in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
This Uncertainty was especially observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in their <hi>Oracles,</hi> which were the most famous
way of Divining among the Gentiles: the Priests
were forced to speak in ambiguous Terms, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to salve their Credit by that Obscurity and
Ambiguity. But we find no such thing in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Oracles and Predictions of the Old and New
Testament; these are plain and intelligible, clear
and open: Or if some few of them may seem not
to be so, yet there are great numbers of others
that we cannot but acknowledg to be most evident
and perspicuous; and in respect of the Issue and
Event of them, we know and are assured that they
are Certain and Infallible. Or secondly, their
knowledg of future Events by those foresaid ways
of Divining, was by mere Accident. Their Sooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayers
by Chance told Truth, as Liars sometimes
do: which appears from this, that they very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hit upon an Event that came to pass. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may infer, that when they did, it was not
by Skill, but Chance. But this cannot be said of
the Predictions I have been treating of, for there
is not one of them that hath failed; and I could
have produced hundreds of Prophecies more, and
shew'd the plain Accomplishment of them. Or
thirdly, their knowledg of future Things was <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical,</hi>
by which I mean this, that it was gain'd
by that Communion and Correspondence which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46315:20"/>
they held with Daemons or Evil Spirits. But here
it will be demanded, How can these Spirits know
future Events? And if they do know them, how
is our former Assertion true, that the knowing
and predicting of these things is from God alone?
I answer briefly, That it is possible for the Infernal
Spirits, and for Men by their Assistance, to attain
to the knowledg of some future Occurrences: but
those which we read are foretold in Scripture, are
none of that number, but are of another and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Kind. First then, we grant that these <hi>Daemons</hi>
(as that very Name imports) are <hi>Knowing</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
Creatures, and have a great Insight into
the Nature of things, and are endued with a more
than ordinary knowledg of Physical Causes and
Effects: whence we may easily infer the possibility
of their diving into some future Transactions
which depend wholly on Natural Agents. In the
next place, those Spirits have had long Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of things, and are thereby grown very saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and cunning, and on that account are able
to guess of things that are to come: for by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
what hath a long time happened in such and
such Circumstances, they may not unsuccessfully
sometimes conjecture what will be for the future.
Moreover, those Nimble Intelligences travelling
up and down the World, ranging and flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and visiting the remotest Regions of the
Earth, and that with unspeakable Expedition, must
needs inform themselves concerning the diverse
Occurrences abroad, and make very great Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
as to what shall be afterwards, from the
Consults and Actions which they behold in the
World. The Devil appearing in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Shape,
told King <hi>Saul</hi> he should be with him the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing;
for he might partly know the Event of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46315:21"/>
the Battel, by what he knew concerning the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Strength, and the Anger of God against that
forsaken Prince, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Diodorus</hi> the Sicilian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
that the Chaldean Priests foretold the Death
of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, and the dividing of the
Empire among his Captains: which they might
venture to do (and it seems their Prediction suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded)
by the Information they had from those
Daemons they convers'd with, who 'tis likely not
only saw the debauched Life of that King, but the
great Mischief which it did to his Body, and from
thence the probability of his being dispatched by
a violent Fever, (of which we read he died;) and
they were not ignorant of the Ambition and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of his Captains; nay, perhaps they were
conscious to some Cabals which promoted those
Events; and then 'tis not to be wondred that they
could foretel them. But there was another way
too of foreknowing these things, for they might
be found predicted in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <hi>Prophecies,</hi> (of which
we have spoken) which the Chaldean Priests had
without doubt some knowledg of. There they
found it written in express words, <hi>chap. 8. 8. The
great Horn</hi> (which, as the preceding Verses will
inform you, is meant of <hi>Alexander the Great)
was broken, (i. e.</hi> in plain terms, he died) <hi>and for
it came up four notable ones, (i. e.</hi> his four chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
succeeded him in the Empire.) And this
you will find repeated almost in the same words, in
<hi>chap.</hi> 11. 4. that there might be no mistake about
the Prophecy. But truly I am enclined to think
that there is yet another Account to be given of
this Passage in <hi>Diodorus,</hi> for (as I shall hereafter
make it more evident) there are a great many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46315:21"/>
in the Pagan Historians to what is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Old Testament, though they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
done with some Obscurity or Mistake. And
I take this to be of that nature; for the Historian
refers here not only to the <hi>Book of Daniel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> (which
questionless was very famous in those days) and
particularly to those Prophetick Words before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but to <hi>Daniel himself:</hi> He was that <hi>Chaldean
Priest;</hi> for though he was an Hebrew by Birth, yet
<hi>Chaldea</hi> was the Country he lived in, and he was
in high esteem with the Chaldean Kings. But
when the Historian speaks in the Plural of <hi>Chaldean
Priests,</hi> it is a pardonable Oversight, and such as
is frequent in Writers. And he calls them <hi>Priests,</hi>
because among the Chaldeans their Priests were
the most knowing Men, and the <hi>Magi</hi> and these
were Terms convertible sometimes. Or to call
<hi>Daniel</hi> a <hi>Priest</hi> instead of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> is a Mistake
both easy and excusable: wherefore notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this small Slip, there is reason to believe that
the Historian refers to the <hi>Prophet Daniel,</hi> who
once and again in very intelligible, though Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Terms, foretels the Death of that Great
Monarch, and the Division of his Kingdoms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
his Captains. I might add likewise, that
Evil Spirits are considerable Actors in the Affairs
on Earth; and therefore 'tis no wonder that they
are able to foretel what they themselves are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing
to bring to pass. They could easily inform
<hi>Spurina</hi> of <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s Fate, when they had been
present at the Consults of the Senate, and were
Instigators to take away his Life. St. <hi>Austin</hi> speaks
of one that knew and could tell the Thoughts of
Men, as when one thought of a Verse in <hi>Virgil,</hi> or
the like. But<note n="*" place="bottom">Colloqu. Mensal.</note> 
                        <hi>Luther</hi> said well, the Devil had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46315:22"/>
before possessed his Thoughts with that Verse, and
then it was not difficult to foretel what he did
himself. Thus you see how far, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
Devils and wicked Men by their Means may
foreknow Futurities. But now if we consider the
things foretold in the Old and New Testament,
we cannot apply any thing of all this to them: for
the foreknowing that K. <hi>Iosias, Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
should appear in the World so many Years
afterwards, the predicting of the Succession of the
three Great Monarchies, (for one of them was
past) the erecting of the Kingdom of Christ, the
wonderful Propagation of the Gospel, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of Jews and Gentiles, and the like, could
not possibly be from the sagacious Insight into
the Nature of things, which the Evil Spirits
may attain to, nor from their Observation and
Experience, which are only of things past or
present; nor from any Acquaintance with the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the World, as being Actors in them: for
some of these Events which we have mentioned
out of the Sacred Writings, had no dependance
on Common and Natural Causes, and therefore
could not be penetrated into by the most subtile
Enquirers into Nature, as we suppose Evil Angels
to be: and besides, they were at so vast a distance
in respect of Time, that it is impossible to imagine
that these Spiritual Agents could have any Part
then to act in them. No Man of Sense can prevail
with himself to credit any such thing, but on the
contrary he must be forc'd to acknowledg that it
is wholly against the Nature of those Events, to
be foreseen and discover'd by any Diabolick Skill
so long a time before they actually happened.
Wherefore I conclude, that the foreknowing, and
consequently the foretelling of them, was by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Revelation from God. He was pleased by

give them a discovery of those things which no
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>reated Understanding could discern. Lastly,
This may suffice in answer to those who suppose
that some Persons who converse with <hi>Diabolick</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
may have some Foresight of future Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies;
this (I say) may suffice, that the Case we
speak of, is far different: here can be nothing of
the Devil, because these Prophecies, and all the
other Writings to the Old and New Testament,
tend to the promoting of Holiness and Godliness,
and the destroying the Works of the Devil. Their
main Design is to weaken, and even demolish Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
Kingdom, and to set up that of Christ Jesus
both in the Consciences and Lives of Men. It is
ridiculous therefore to say, that these Prophecies
are from the Devil. No Man of ordinary S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ns<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
can digest such a Proposition; it is impossible it
should gain the Assent of any intelligent and sober
Person. When we consider the Nature of these
Prophecies, and what they aim at, we must needs
own them to be from Him to whom all Future
Things are Present, and who is the Cause as well
as the Foreseer of them. And therefore when we
observe that the things which the Writers of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture have delivered, are actually come to
pass, we may with reason conclude, that their
Writings are not Forgeries; but on the contrary,
that the Penmen of them were Inspired Persons;
that they had the Gift of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> which is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Testimony of their Authority. These
things being thus foretold so long before, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
exactly verified since, it undeniably follows,
that the Books which contain these Predictions,
and are founded on them, are True and Certain.

and Formalities of Speech which are so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

of these is, that they are not Artificial and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died,
but Simple, Plain and Careless; and that
their whole Frame and Contexture are not such as
ours. An artificial Method is below the Majesty
of that Spirit which dictated them. This would
debase the Scriptures, and equal them with the
Writings of Men. Wherefore the oftner I look
into that Sacred Volume, and the more I observe
it, the more I am convinced that the Pens of the
Writers were wholly directed by a Divine Hand.

                        </gap>
Expression in them is different from what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of themselves would have used. If they had
been left to their own Genius, they would have
delivered things in another Method and Manner
than you see them in. The Stile of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shews the Author. In short, had the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
been written in the common way of other
Writers, this would have disparaged them, and
we should have had no reason to think that they
were Divinely inspired, which is the thing I am
now proving.</p>
                     <p>Nay, I will adjoin this, that the very Words
and Phrases of Scripture were dictated by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
the very particular Expressions and Modes of
Speech were under the particular Guidance and
Direction of the Holy Ghost. I know there are
many of a contrary Judgment, among whom the
worthy Writer whom I last quoted, is not the
least confident, and positively asserts that the Stile
and Language of Scripture were not dictated by
the Holy Ghost, but the Matter only. The Words,
saith he, were left to the Writers themselves, who
as Men of Sense could express their Minds in fit
Terms. And to prove that the Words were not
dictated by the Spirit, he urgeth this, that Christ
and his Apostles quote Places out of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
as they are translated by the <hi>Seventy,</hi> which
is not <hi>verbatim.</hi> Now, saith he, they would have
cited the Passages in the very original Phrases and
Words, if these had been from Divine Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It is evident therefore that they are not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Apostles use other Words and Terms,
far different from those in the Hebrew. But this
is no valid Argument, if you rightly consider it:
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46315:25"/>
for though the Apostles thought fit (for some Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
which I shall have occasion afterwards to offer
to you) to make use of the Septuagint Version,
which is but a Paraphrase in many places on the
Original Text, yet it doth not follow hence that
the very Words of the Original were not dictated
by the Holy Ghost. Neither our Saviour, nor the
Evangelists and Apostles, do hereby declare that
the Hebrew Text was not inspired, and that even
as to the Phrase and Words: but all that we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from their using of the Greek Translation, is
this, that they found it convenient at that time
(for Reasons which shall afterwards be alledged)
to quote some Places as they are rendred by those
Translators, and not exactly according to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal.
This doth not necessarily imply, much
less prove that the Penmen of the Old Testament
were not assisted by the Spirit in the very Words
which they used. But the contrary is grounded
on very good Reason, for these Sacred Writings
being of a more excellent and transcendent Nature
than all others in the World besides, it was meet
that they should surpass them all in This, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Divinity of the very Stile. If you grant not this,
you acknowledg these Writings, in one respect at
least, and that no inconsiderable one, to be no
better than the common Writings of other Men:
which certainly cannot but be look'd upon as a
great vilifying of the Bible. Christ promised his
Disciples, that when they should be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Governours and Kings for his Sake, <hi>it should
be given them what they should speak: for</hi> (as he
adds) <hi>it is not they that speak, but the Spirit of their
Father that speaketh in them,</hi> Mat. 10. 19, 20. And
is it not most reasonable to think that the same
Spirit taught the Writers of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46315:26"/>
                        <hi>what they should speak,</hi> and commit to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and gave them <hi>Words</hi> to that purpose? Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if you consider that this was a Book which
was to last to all Generations in the Church, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

End; and accordingly was to be produced upon
all Occasions, and therefore was to be of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Composure, and every Word and Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was to be from God, and the Direction of his
Holy Spirit. St. <hi>Peter</hi> assures us, that the Writer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

nothing of that nature can be utter'd and express'd

to be exploded.<note n="*" place="bottom">Chrysost. Homil. in Saul. tom. 8.</note>

                        <hi>It speaks nothing in vain, nothing by chance.</hi> And
the reason is, because All of it (Words no less

by an unerring Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Yet I speak not this as if the Sacred Writers of
the Bible were so tied up by the Spirit, that they
cannot, or do not make use of their own natural
or acquired Skill. Though the Words be dictated
by the Spirit, yet the Penmen might write and
speak according to the Improvements they had
made in Speech. I do not by what I have said,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46315:27"/>
exclude the peculiar Eloquence or Strain of the
Writers, or their using the Helps of their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or their conforming to the Dialect of their
Countrey: for these are consistent with That.
<hi>Isaiah</hi> being a Courtier, and a Person of Quality,
hath a neat and elegant Stile; and yet so as he
knows how to vary it according to the Matter he
treats of: But generally he is Lofty and Eloquent,
his Stile being raised by his Education, which was
sutable to his Noble Extraction, for he was of the
Blood Royal. <hi>Ieremiah</hi> and <hi>Amos</hi> being used to
the Countrey, are mean and homely in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
the latter especially discovers his Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and way of Life in his low and rural Strain.
So in the New Testament, St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
himself by Art and Study, is very obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of the Greek Elegancy, and avoids all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
and exotick Terms in his <hi>Gospel</hi> and in the
<hi>Acts.</hi> Indeed the Stile of the Sacred Penmen is
very different, and that Difference is an Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in this Book of God. But that which I say is
this, the Writers leave not off their peculiar Stile,
though they were moved by the Spirit. As this
furnished them with new Expressions, so it let them
make use of their own usual ones, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
directed and assisted them in the applying of
them. So that at the same time when they used
their Natural Stile, they were Divinely help'd to
make it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erviceable to that purpose which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost intended. Hence I conclude, that the
Stile, and Words, and Composure of the Sacred
Writings are such as ought to be reckoned Divine.
For this is one difference between this Book and
others, that every thing of it is Divine. And
therefore those Persons who dream of Solecis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

but especially those who assert there are
Mistakes and literal Falsities in the Holy Book, are

                        <hi>Episcopius,</hi>
who dares affirm, <q>That the Spirit left the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Holy Scripture to their own humane
Frailty in delivering such things as belonged to

                        </gap>ty, but that they might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
some Passages. <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> is of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that there are some considerable Slips in
Scripture from the weakness of the Evangelists and
Apostles Memories. Yea, among the antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
there was<note n="‖" place="bottom">Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronym. in Isai. 29, &amp; 56. In Joel 11. In Mic. 5. Item in 1 Ep. ad Tim. Necnon in Epist. suâ 50.</note> one who more grosly held, that
the Writers of the New Testament sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused
the Testimonies of the Prophets of the Old
Testament; and that they applied them to their
present purpose, although they were nothing to it.
<q>Thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he saith, quoteth the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his Epistles to the <hi>Romans, Galatians</hi> and
<hi>Ephesians,</hi> only to serve his turn, and to confute
the Jews his Adversaries. Read, saith he, these
Epistles, wherein the Apostle is wholly on the
Polemick part, and<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">Videbitis eum in testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niis quae habet de Veteri Testamento, quam prudens, quam dissimulator sit ejus quod agit. <hi>Hieron. Apol. adv. Rufin.</hi>
                           </note> you will see how prudently
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46315:28"/>
and dissemblingly he acts in those Texts which
he citeth out of the Old Testament.</q> And at
other times this bold Man is not afraid to say that
some of the Matters and Things in Scripture are
set down wrong. This is no less than Profane and
Blasphemous Doctrine: wherefore that Father is
to be read with great Caution in such places as
these. We on the contrary assert, that God was
not only the Author of the Matter and Contents
of Holy Writ, but also of the Words and Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
yea, even when those Writers express their
Sense in their own Terms, <hi>i. e.</hi> according to the
Way and Dialect which they were Masters of, and
which was most familiar to them, even then they
were immediately assisted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> the Spirit. Which
was absolutely necessary, that this Book might
have no Errors and Failings in it of any kind, but
that it might transcend all other Writings what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
If you do not hold this, you make no
considerable difference between the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and other Writings. Therefore I am tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
convinced that this is a Truth, and ought
to be maintained, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Holy Spirit endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the very Stile of Scripture, that even this was
by the immediate Inspiration of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>Manner</hi> of its writing I may well annex
its <hi>Harmony,</hi> and thence also prove it to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.
Though there are several <hi>seeming Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies,</hi>
(of which I shall treat afterwards in a
Discourse of the <hi>Stile</hi> of Scripture, and endeavour
to clear them up to the Satisfaction of every sober
and considerate Person) yet it cannot but be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that all the Parts of this Book do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
agree, and are consistent with one another.
This in other Books, which are composed and
written by one Author, is not so admirable, (tho
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:46315:28"/>
in those Pieces we oftentimes meet with very pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
Disagreements and Contradictions;) but
here we are able to remember, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Books were written by different Persons,
and those many in number, and disagreeing in
Quality, and extremely distant as to Time and
Place, yet their Writings contradict not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but there is an excellent Harmony in all their
Parts, there is a perfect Concord and Consent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them all, such as is not to be found in any
other Authors in the World, though of the same
Sect and Party. Excellently to this purpose a
very Wise and Judicious<note n="*" place="bottom">Iudg <hi>Hale</hi> of the Knowledg of God, and of our Selves.</note> Man thus speaks:
<q>When several Men in several Ages, not brought
up under the same Education, write, it is not
possible to find Unity in their Tenents or Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
because their Spirits, Judgments and
Fancies are different: but where so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Authors, speaking and writing at several
times, agree not only in Matters Dogmatical,
of sublime and difficult Natures, but also in
Predictions of future and contingent Events,
whereof it is impossible for humane Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make a Discovery, without a superiour
Discovery made to it, I must needs conclude
one and the same Divine Spirit declared the
same Truths to these several Men.</q> And as to
the seeming Contrarieties of some Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
this should not at all trouble us; for this is
rather an Argument of the Truth and Authority of
it: it is a sign the Writers did not combine together
to cheat and delude us. If they had designed any
such thing, we should not have met with any Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
and seemingly Repugnant Places in these
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46315:29"/>
Writings. But seeing we do so, this (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things) may confirm us in this Belief, that
the Scriptures were not contrived by Men who had
a design to impose upon us; for if they had had
such a Design, they would have so ordered it, that
not the least appearance of Contradiction and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
should have been found. But truly there
is no necessity of proceeding thus in this Discourse;
for to an unprejudiced and industrious Enquirer,
there is nothing in Scripture that looks like Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
and Contradictory. Upon a diligent Search
we shall discern a mutual Correspondence in the
Stile, Matter, and Design of these Writings; we
shall find a happy Concurrence of Circumstances,
and an admirable Consistency in the Doctrines and
Discourses, in so much that we shall be forced to
acknowledg, that upon this single Consideration it
is reasonable to believe that these Writings were
endited by the Holy Spirit. This Harmony then
of the Scriptures I may justly reckon among the
<hi>Inward Notes</hi> of the Truth of Scripture, because it
is adjoined to the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, which is of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Intrinsick</hi> Nature of it. What <hi>Iustinian</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
and promises concerning his <hi>Digests</hi> in his
Preface to them, that there is nothing Clashing
and Contradictory in them, but that they are all
of a piece, is true only of the <hi>Sacred Laws,</hi> of the
<hi>Evangelical Pandects,</hi> which contain in them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Dissonant and Repugnant. The Old and
New Testament, the Prophets and Apostles are
consonant to themselves, and to one another;
which is a great Argument of the Truth of them.
There is nothing in one Place of Scripture oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to the true Meaning which the Holy Ghost
hath revealed and asserted in another. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the whole Book, whether you look into
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46315:29"/>
the Doctrinal or Historical Part of it, have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
contradictory in them: All the Authors of
it agree in their Testimonies, and assert the same
thing, and consent among themselves. It is the
Nature of Lies and Forgeries, that they hang not
together, as<note n="*" place="bottom">Haec est Mendaciorum natura, ut cohaerere non possint. <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

seen through. But the Contents of these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
have been diligently inquired into, and with
great Care and Industry examined by all sorts of
Persons; and yet they are found to be every ways
Consistent with themselves, and the Testimony of
the Writers is known to be Concurrent and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
All wise and curious Observers must needs
grant, that there is no Book under Heaven that
parallels the Scriptures as to this: Which shews
that they are more than Humane Writings, yea
that they were Divinely inspired and dictated.
And this I take to be the Sense of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who
assures us, that<note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>no Prophecy of the Scripture is of
private Interpretation.</hi> He speaks of the first Rise
of those Prophecies which are in Scripture: they
are from God, <hi>they are not of private Interpretation;</hi>
they are not from Man's Invention, they are not
of his own Brain and Fancy, but they are to be
esteem'd to be (as they are) Divine and Heavenly
Oracles. Thus<note n="‖" place="bottom">Alia omnia Dicta argumentis ac testibus egent; Dei autem Sermo ipse sibi testis est. <hi>Salvian. de Guber.</hi> l. 3.</note> the Word of God is Witness

they carry no such <hi>Native Marks</hi> with them. But
the very <hi>Inward Notes</hi> of the Truth and Authority
of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> create in us a certain and unsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Belief. They may be known from all other
Writings whatsoever, by the Excellent, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent,
and Divine <hi>Matter</hi> contained in them,
and by the peculiar <hi>Manner</hi> of delivering and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
it. These I call <hi>Internal Proofs,</hi> because
they are taken from the Books themselves, because
they are something that we find there. These as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
us that they were written not by Man, but by
God.</p>
                     <p>There is yet another <hi>Internal Testimony.</hi> I call
it so, because it is <hi>within Vs,</hi> though not <hi>in the
Scriptures.</hi> As I have shewed you that the Holy
Spirit speaks in the Scriptures, and bears Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to the Truth of them, so now I add, that
this Spirit speaks <hi>in Vs,</hi> and works in our Hearts a
Perswasion that the Scriptures are the Word of
God. By this Spirit we are enabled to discern the
Voice of the same Spirit, and of Christ in those
Writings. This witnessing Power of the Spirit in
the Souls of Believers, is asserted in <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 32. &amp;
15. 7, 8. and in 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 6. From these Places it
is clear, that there is an Illumination of the Spirit
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46315:30"/>
joining with our Consciences and Perswasions; and
this Spirit powerfully convinces all Believers of
the Truth of the Scriptures. This Testimony
follows immediately on our setting before us the
Inward Excellencies of the Scripture, as I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
them: for God makes use of those Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
and Arguments to beget a Belief in us of
the Divine Authority of Scripture. The Spirit
enlightens and convinces Mens Minds by those
Means; but more especially he urges these Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
on the Hearts of the Religious and Faithful,
and thereby brings them to a firm Perswasion of
the Scriptures being the Word of God. This is
no <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> because it is discovered to us by
proper Means and Instruments; whereas <hi>that</hi> is
without any, and is generally accompanied with
the despising of them. But the Evidences and
Notes in the Scripture are the Reasons and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of our Belief: only the Holy Spirit comes
and prepares and sanctifies our Minds, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
our Consciences, and causes those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Motives to make Impression upon us,
and effectually to prevail with us, and to silence
all Objections to the contrary. Thus the Truth of
Scripture is attested by the Holy Spirit witnessing
in us. But when I say the Testimony of the Spirit
is a Proof of the Truth of the Scripture, I must
adjoin this, that this Proof serves only for those
that have this Spirit: it may establish <hi>them,</hi> but it
cannot convince <hi>others.</hi> No other Man can be
brought to be perswaded of the Truth of those
Sacred Writings, by the Spirit's convincing me of
the Truth of them. Besides, this Proof is not in
all that really believe the Truth of these Books:
some may be convinced of the Truth of them
without this; but where this is, it is most Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46315:31"/>

                        <hi>SEcondly,</hi> I proceed to the <hi>External Testimonies</hi>
of the Truth of the Scriptures: which being
added to those Arguments which proved them to
be True in Themselves, will exceedingly corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
our Belief of the Divine Authority of those
Books. And here I might mention the Testimony
given to them by <hi>God</hi> in the wonderful Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them through all Ages since they were first
written. In all the Changes of Affairs, and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46315:31"/>
Overthrow of so many Cities and Kingdoms, that
Incomparable Treasure hath not been lost. The
Books of the Old Testament were kept untouched
and inviolable at the sacking and burning of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi>
and all the time of the Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi>
and of the Dispersion of the Jews. And ever
since that time the Scriptures have been Unaltered
in Words and Sense, notwithstanding the frequent
Endeavours of Satan's busy Agents to corrupt
them, yea utterly to destroy them. And next to
God's Providence in preserving these Books thrô
all Times and Ages, we might add the marvellous
Success which hath attended the Holy Faith and
Doctrine contained in these Writings. They have
prevail'd against the Power of Men and Devils,
and to this very day they are maintained and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
maugre the Attempts of both of them to root
them out of the World.</p>
                     <p>But I wave this, intending not to insist upon <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
but <hi>Humane</hi> Testimony in this place. By
<hi>External Testimony</hi> then I mean here no other than
this, that Scripture is attested by <hi>Vniversal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
and this Tradition is both of Jews and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
And what would a Man desire more in a
humane way for attesting the Truth of these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings?
From the joint Attestation of these Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
I shall make it appear, that these Books
which we now have, are the true Copies of the first
Originals; that the same Books and Authors are
faithfully delivered down to us, which were first
of all delivered to the Jews, and to the Primitive
Christians; and that there is nothing in these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,

the Assembly of Doctors for that purpose; and
consequently that the Canon of Sacred Scripture

owned, and solemnly vouched the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of every one of them, that the Church for the
future might not doubt of their being Authentick
and True. But some add here, by way of <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
that this holy Man caused these Books to be
written over in a <hi>New Character,</hi> because the Jews
had lost their knowledg of the former one, as
well as of the Tongue; and consequently the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is not the same that it was at first. <hi>Eusebius</hi>
and <hi>Ierom</hi> are alledged for this, especially the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who seems to say that the <hi>Samaritan Character</hi>
was the Old Hebrew Character in which the Bible
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46315:32"/>
was first writ, and that it was first changed by

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he Sacred Volume over in Assyrian or Chaldee
Letters, and neglecting the Old Hebrew ones
which were the same that the Samaritan are. And
the reason of this was, they say, because the Jews
were best acquainted with this Character at that
time. And some<note n="*" place="bottom">Bellarmin, Joseph Scaliger, Casaubon, Arias Montanus, Villalpandus, Drusius, Capellus, Morinus, Bochart, Vossius, Walton.</note> Modern Writers are gain'd
over to this Opinion, who talk much of the Change
of the Character, and endeavour to perswade us
that the first and old Letters of the Hebrew Text
were <hi>Samaritan,</hi> but that those which we now have
are <hi>Assyrian,</hi> and of quite another sort. But upon
an impartial Enquiry, I find little or no Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for this Opinion: It rather seems to me to be
an Invention and Dream of those who design to
disparage the Hebrew Bible. They would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us that the Authority of the Original is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
because we have it not now as it was at
the beginning; for the Old Bible was in Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
Letters, these being the first and antientest
Hebrew Characters. This is like the Story of the
<hi>Hebrew Points</hi> being invented five hundred Years
after Christ, (of which afterwards) which tends
to the same End, namely to discredit the Hebrew
Text which we now have, and wholly to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
its Authority; for if the <hi>Letters</hi> were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
it is probable some Words, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Sense of some Places are altered. But that
this is groundless, and that the Hebrew Bible is
written in the same Characters now that it was at

you that the Hebrew Letters which we have now
in the Bible, were the Primitive ones, the very
same that were of old. But to give you my
Thoughts impartially in this Point, I do believ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
from what I find asserted by Writers on both sides,
that there were two sorts of <hi>Characters</hi> used by the
Jews, as there were two sorts of <hi>Cubits</hi> and <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kels,</hi>
the Sacred and Common: and I gather, that
the Samaritan Letter was of the latter sort, that
which was commonly used, and even sometimes
in transcribing the Bible; but the Sacred Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
in use among the Jews was this which
we now have, and in which the Bible is at this
day. This is the true Original Hebrew Letter,
and was used from the beginning by them. This
I think may reconcile the Disputes among Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
for so far as I can perceive, the Quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
from this, that there is frequent mention made
in Jewish and other Authors, of the Bible's being
written in an old <hi>Samaritan Character;</hi> whence it
was inferr'd by some, that this was the Primitive
Character wherein the Bible was written, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that this which we now have is not the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46315:33"/>
true Genuine Character. But I answer, this doth
not follow; for this Samaritan Vulgar Character
was not the first and antientest, though it was
sometimes in use: but the Sacred Character, now
called the Hebrew Character, is really such, and
is the true and most antient Letter wherein this
holy Book was written. This is the Authentick
Letter which God himself graved the Law in,
and thence had the Name of the <hi>Sacred Character:</hi>
but the other called the <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Vulgar,</hi> was
not in that esteem, it being a Deviation from that
Primitive one. And yet to speak freely, there
was no great difference between these two Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
the latter being only some Variation and
Degeneracy from the former, which happened by
length of Time. This is the real Truth of the
Matter, and it solves the Controversy, and ends
all the Disputes on both sides. And the Learned
French Critick, who seem'd to be of another Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
comes over at last to this, when<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>F. Simon</hi>'s Crist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hist: of the Bible.</note> he tells
us, <q>That there is no reason for Criticks to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
so fiercely about the first Hebrew Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters:
for if we attentively consider and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
together the Samaritan and Hebrew Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,
we shall find that the difference between
them is not so great, but that they may be
thought to have had one and the same Origine.</q>
And he grants also, that 'tis from the Succession of
so many Ages, (which is wont to produce some
Alteration) that there hath been this Variation
from their first Figure. But this is inconsiderable,
so that both Characters may be said to be the same.
We have no ground then to think that <hi>Ezra</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Character, but that he only amended the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46315:34"/>
Defects and Slips which he found in the Hebrew
for by consulting and comparing the several Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies,
he purged them from the Errors and Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not their laborious Niceties, their childish Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations

their trifling Annotations on the Figure and Make

of God's Providence in making these Critical Men
to be very serviceable towards the preserving the
Bible of the Old Testament in its Purity. The
Observations of these Masoretick Doctors, who
were Persons of great Skill in the Language, and
well acquainted with all the antient Copies and
Manuscripts, and who above a thousand Years ago
exactly numbred all the Verses, Words, Letters,
and even the minutest parts of the Hebrew Text,
have been a great Security and Preservative to it;
they have kept it undepraved and uncorrupt, and
have made the Reading of it certain and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
This is the reason why that Excellent and
Noble Personage, the Learned <hi>Picus Mirandula,</hi>
so highly extols the Hebrew <hi>Cabala;</hi> without
doubt he saw this Usefulness and Excellency in it.
Nay, before these Doctors of <hi>Tiberias</hi> drew up
their Masoretick Notes, there was (it is probable)
extant something of this nature. They had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Morcover, if we should suppose the Law
was burnt in the Temple, yet there were many
Copies of it among the Jews, which without doubt
were preserved. We have no reason therefore to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46315:36"/>
suspect that the Hebrew Original of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
is corrupted.</p>
                     <p>But some of the Antient Fathers in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Church, as well as some Learned Moderns, have
asserted that the Hebrew is corrupted. I answer,
first, as to the Fathers; it is granted that <hi>Iustin
Martyr</hi> declares himself to be of this Opinion. In
his Dialogue with <hi>Trypho</hi> he considently assirms,
that the Jews erased many things out of the Bible;
and he assigns particular Instances in the <hi>Psalms,
Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah.</hi> And this they did, saith he,
because they hated Christ and his Religion, and
thought some of those Places favoured the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Cause too much. (Here by the by you may
take notice of that great Mistake and Oversight in
Bishop <hi>Ward</hi>'s<note n="*" place="bottom">Part 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Essays,</hi> where he peremptorily
asserts, that [<hi>never any of the Antient Fathers have
in their greatest heat of Zeal against the Iews, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them of such Corruption] i. e.</hi> of the Scriptures.)
But this is not the first time that <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi>
hath suffer'd himself to be impos'd upon in matter
of Historical Truth. This, among others, is
questionless a gross Mistake of that good Man;
and his strong Averseness to the Jews, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of their Willingness and Readiness to deprave
the Scriptures for their own Ends, betrayed him
to it. As for other Fathers, as <hi>Tertullian, Irenaecus,
Origen, Eusebius,</hi> who, it is true, sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that the Scripture is corrupted by the Jews,
they speak of their adulterating the Text rather
as to the Sense than as to the Words; they mean
that the Translations which the Jews used were
false, for they generally adhered to <hi>Aquila</hi>'s and
<hi>Theodotion</hi>'s Version, and preferr'd it before that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46315:37"/>
of the <hi>Seventy.</hi> Whence their Interpretations of
Scripture were unsound and erroneous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they sometimes set up Judaism against Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
But this was done without corrupting th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
Hebrew Copies of the Bible. And that the Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

two Antient Fathers, of a great Fame for Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and Piety as those before named. These
worthy Persons refute that Suspicion and Rumour
which it seems were then risen, namely, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
Fathers not only declare that they did no such
thing, but they praise them for their Faithfulness
in preserving the Bible pure and uncorrupt. Then
as to some of the <hi>Moderns,</hi> who have asserted the
Hebrew Copies to be faulty and depraved, it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
to see what it was that prompted them to it.
The Hebrew Text is corrupted, and so is that of
the Septuagint, say the Romanists: but the old
Vulgar Latin is uncorrupt and infallible, so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
the Tridentine Council.<note n="†" place="bottom">Galatinus, Leo Cast Melchior Canus, Huntlaeus.</note> Several of that
Communion have written against the Purity of the
Hebrew Copies, and laboured to prove them cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt:
but<note n="‖" place="bottom">In Exercitat. &amp; Diatribe.</note> 
                        <hi>Morinus</hi> hath shewed himself more
zealous than all of them in this Point; and he
frankly confesseth this was his main Design in it,
<hi>viz.</hi> to baffle the Protestants, who make the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the Rule of their Faith and Manners. If the

be so too. Wherefore the best and only way is to
have recourse to Tradition and to the Church;
these are the only Rule of what we are to believe

most of the learnedst Men of that Church have not

of Note that holds the contrary, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the
Hebrew Bible, as it is now, is corrupted by the
Jews. But against him and all others (either An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
or Modern) who are of this Opinion, I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
these following things to be considered. If the
Jews corrupted the Hebrew Text, they did it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>before</hi> or <hi>after</hi> Christ's time. That they did
it not <hi>before,</hi> is evident; because first our Saviour
never takes notice of any such thing, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he would not have omitted at such times as
he reproved the Scribes and Pharisees for their
known Faults and Offences, especially relating to
the Law; as when he taxed them for <hi>making the
Law of God of none effect by their Traditions.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he would have rebuked them for so gross a
Fault, when he corrected them for some that were
lesser. Nay, the Jews are not only not reproved
for corrupting the Canon of Scripture, but on the
contrary, their Care and Faithfulness in preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it whole and entire, are particularly taken
notice of, <hi>Luke 4. 16, 17. Acts</hi> 13. 27. &amp; 15. 21.

                        </gap>tles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

proved their Doctrine, and confuted the
Jews out of those very Writings; which is an
Argument that in our Saviour's time those Books
were not corrupted: else he and the Apostles
would not have so frequently quoted them, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ed the Testimony of almost every particular
Book as Authentical, and of Divine Inspiration.
And that the Hebrew Text was not corrupted by
the Jews <hi>after</hi> our Saviour's time, is as manifest,
because the Testimonies cited out of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
by those that succeeded Christ and hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
Apostles, are found to be the same in those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
now, without the least Alteration. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
it cannot be shewed at what time after Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
the Corruption or Alteration of the Text began:
though the Younger <hi>Vossius</hi> is pleased to say it was
presently after the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which
yet he hath no where proved. Farther, if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
those Places in the Hebrew Text, which
some alledg as corrupted by the Jews, you'll find
that there was no Occasion or Ground for so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
them. If they changed the Text, it was
questionless for their own Ends, and to maintain
some Error of theirs; the Alteration would espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
have been in those Places which speak of
Christ the true Messias, but you will not discover
any such thing. If any object <hi>Psal. 22. 16. They
pierced my Hands and my Feet,</hi> and say that the Jews
have there purposely changed <hi>Caaru</hi> into <hi>Caari;</hi> I
ask, why did the Masorites restore it to its right
Reading? If it had been corrupted by the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46315:38"/>
Doctors on purpose, it would not have been
taken notice of here by Men of the same Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
but they would have let it remain without
any Marginal Correction. But seeing they did
not, it is a sign there was no Intention to corrupt
the Text. This indeed they do, they add a <hi>Keri</hi>
to the <hi>Ketib,</hi> i. e. instead of <hi>Carri sicut Leo</hi> in the
Text, they write in the Margin <hi>Caaru foderunt,</hi> as
much as to say that <hi>Caaru</hi> is the true and genuine
Reading. This the Masoretick Note here testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.
Besides, it is evident that the Seventy did
read it so, and accordingly translated it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>;
and thus 'tis rendred in the Syriack, Arabick, Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opick
and Latin. But the Place was by chance cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
because of the likeness of the two Vowels
<hi>Iod</hi> and <hi>Vau,</hi> and not out of design; for then the
<hi>Masorite</hi> Jews would not have supplied it in the
Margin with that other word <hi>Caaru, they pierced;</hi>
which agrees with the History of Christ's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
Yea, this Word is in some antient Copies
in the Text it self; which is not denied by the
learned Father of the Oratory, who had it from
<hi>Rabbi ben Hajim</hi> the great Restorer of the <hi>Masora;</hi>
who acknowledgeth that in some of the Hebrew
Manuscripts of the Bible which he had seen, <hi>Caaru
they pierced,</hi> or <hi>digged,</hi> was in the Text. Or, why
may we not take in both the Words into the Text,
and so reconcile the Textual and Marginal Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
This we find done by the Chaldee Version,
which renders the Place thus, <hi>They did bite or pierce
like a Lion;</hi> as if the Original ran thus, <hi>Caaru ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ari,
foderunt sicut Leo.</hi> This in my opinion may
be a safe way of composing the Difference about
this Text. However, not only from this, but
what hath been said before, I think it is manifest
that the Jews did not adulterate this Text. And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46315:39"/>
among all those other Texts that are said to be
chang'd and adulterated, you will scarcely find
one that hath reference to that great Concern o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
the Jews: whence we may conclude that the Old
Testament remains altogether unaltered. I might
farther add, that the Multitude of Copies was
great every-where both before and after Christ's
time, so that it was impossible to corrupt them all.
I know some have inferr'd the Corruption of the
Original Hebrew from the great difference which
is to be found between that and the Version of the
Seventy: but I shall afterwards (when I come to
speak of the <hi>Perfection</hi> of Scripture) give a large
and full Account of the Reason of this Difference;
whence I shall make it plain that this Difference
proceeds not at all from the Depravation of the
Original Hebrew. The short then is, that the
Hebrew Bible is pure and uncorrupt; and after all
the Disputes about the various Readings, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable,
that there is no difference in the Hebrew
Copies as to any thing considerable and of moment;
it toucheth not any necessary Point of Religion,
which we are bound to know and practise. In the
several Copies the same Historical Passages are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
the same Miracles recorded, the same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
and Predictions, the same Doctrines, Laws
and Precepts set down, and that without any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying.
So that we are certain of the Integrity of
the Hebrew Bible. Notwithstanding what hath
been suggested to the contrary, we are assured
that we have the true Authentick Copies of the
first Original Writings; and in a word, that the
Hebrew Text is the same that it was, and is still
in its original Purity.</p>
                     <p>But here it is <hi>objected,</hi> That the Hebrew Copies
of the Bible might easily be corrupted and altered,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46315:39"/>
because they had no <hi>Points</hi> or <hi>Vowels</hi> at first. This
could not but make the Reading very uncertain
and doubtful, and almost arbitrary, especially in
some Places: whence it is easy to imagine how
great Alterations, and consequently great Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
might creep into the Text. In answer
to this you must know, that those only who are
against the Purity of the Hebrew Bible, (as <hi>Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Vossius, Simon, &amp;c.)</hi> hold that the <hi>Points</hi> were
of late Invention. And this they have pick'd up
out of <hi>Elias Levita,</hi> who lived about a hundred
Years ago, and was of opinion that the Vowels
were invented by the Jewish and Masoretick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> (a famous School for the Hebrew
Tongue.) So that it was about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ive hundred Years
after Christ when the Hebrew Points were found
out, and the Rabbins and Masorites of <hi>Tiberias</hi>
were the first Authors of them. This is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Elias</hi> the Levite, and he is the only <hi>Iew</hi>
of this Opinion. Nor is he followed by any <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
but those who have a design to vilify the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Bible, and to prefer and magnify the LXX,
or some other Translation. Of this sort are the
Writers before mentioned, who largely inveigh
against the Authority of the Hebrew Edition.

<hi>Vowels</hi> long before the Doctors of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> which
is said to be about the Year of our Lord 500. And
from what we have observ'd already concerning
the <hi>Masoretick Notes</hi> on the Bible, it is easy to
prove that the <hi>Hebrew Vowels</hi> were before that
time: for if the Masorites criticized on the Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,
(as well as the other Letters and Accents, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
was said before) then 'tis not probable in the least
that they invented them. We find that they take
notice of the Irregularity of these Points in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places: whereas if they had made them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
they would have been all regular. It is
Nonsense to think that they that made the one,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Critical Notes,</hi> made the other, namely
the <hi>Vowels</hi> and <hi>Points.</hi> Hear likewise what the
Learned <hi>Pocock</hi> saith,<note n="†" place="bottom">Comment on <hi>Hosea</hi> 10. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>It is an Argument that the
Vowels were antienter than the Masoretick Notes, in
regard that they seem thereby to be governed in judging
of the Consonants.</hi> And in some other place in his
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46315:40"/>
Commentary, he delivers his Judgment that the
Vowels were not invented by the Masorites, but
were long before them, yea were of the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
with the Letters or Consonants. It is well
known that all the Jews (but him before named)
hold the Antiquity of the Hebrew Points; yea,
some of them carry them back as far as <hi>Adam,</hi> and
vouch they were found out by him. Other Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Men among them assert that these Vowels
were given at the time of the delivering the Law
on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> then it was that God writ the
Decalogue with Points, and gave it to the Jews by
the hands of <hi>Moses.</hi> And as to the rest of the
Writings, and the whole Body of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the common Opinion of the Jews is, that
<hi>Ezra</hi> was the Author of the Vowels which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
to them; and that he and the great Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
of which he was President, first invented
them after the Captivity. Thus whether they
commenced from <hi>Adam,</hi> or from <hi>Moses,</hi> or <hi>Ezra,</hi>
they all agree in this, that they were very antient,
and in a manner coeval with the Letters and
Words; and consequently that they are part of
the Text, and of Divine Authority. This being
so old and so recent an Opinion, it hath gain'd the
Suffrage of the wisest and learnedst Christians in
the World. You may particularly find it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Writings of <hi>Munster, Pagninus, Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torf,
Vsher, Cappellus, Broughton, Lightfoot, Walton,</hi>
all of them singularly well skill'd in Jewish Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and therefore fit Judges in this Cause. They
have proved by undeniable Arguments, that the
Hebrew Bible had Vowels or Pricks from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and that it was never without them.
The Opinion then which the <hi>Objectors</hi> have espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
is justly to be exploded. It is against the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46315:41"/>

that reads without Points, is like a Man that rides
without a Bridle. We therefore firmly maintain,
and that with the approbation of Antiquity, that
the Words of the Hebrew Text had Points added
to them at the beginning; and that these Points
which we now have, are the same with them. To
this purpose we here appeal to the Testimony of
the Jews, who will bear witness that the Books of
the Old Testament, which we now receive, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
exactly to the Pointed Text which they hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

received, and always did. Nay, we may end the
Controversy without an Appeal, for our own Eyes
and Ears will satisfy us. If we compare our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,

one which is used among the Jews, and is daily

and we shall be convinced that they own the same
Books with us.</p>

to be thorowly perswaded that the Books are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
transmitted to us without any Corruption,
and are the same that ever they were, without

they were written by the first Authors; we have

preserving any other sort of Writings under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
And seeing they have so carefully handed
the Old Testament down to us, we are concern'd
to receive it with a proportionable Thankfulness,
and to reckon this their <hi>Delivering</hi> of those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
down to us, as no mean Argument of their
Truth and Certainty.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Authority of the <hi>New Testament</hi>
is confirmed by <hi>External Testimony</hi> or <hi>Tradition,</hi> no
less than that of the Old Testament. We have
the Authentick Suffrage of the Primitive Church,
the Unanimous Consent of the Christians of the
first Ages, that this Book is of Divine Inspiration,
and that it is Pure and Uncorrupted. Some of the
Fathers and first Writers give us a Catalogue of
the Books of the New Testament, and they are
the very same with those which we have at this
day. <hi>Athanasius</hi> particularly enumerating those
Books, sets down all those which we now embrace
as Canonical, and no others. And many of the
Fathers of the first Ages after Christ, as <hi>Irenaeus,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46315:43"/>
Iustin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>
&amp;c. quote the Places in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as they are now. If it be objected, that in
the Fathers <hi>sometimes</hi> the Text of Scripture is not
exactly what we find it, and read it at this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This must be remembred, that they sometimes
quoted the Meaning, not the very Words. At
other times their Memories fail'd them as to the
Words, and thence they chang'd them into others;
and instead of those in the Text, used some that
were like them. So when they were in haste,
and not at leisure to consult the Text, they made
use of such Words and Expressions as they thought
came nearest to it.<note n="*" place="bottom">In Prolegom. in Exercitas. Sac.</note> 
                        <hi>Heinsius</hi> shews this in a vast
many places. Sometimes they contract the Word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of the Text, and give only the brief Sense of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
at other times they enlarge it, and present us with
a Comment upon it: yea, sometimes (as they see
occasion, and as their Matter leads them to it)
they invert the Words, and misplace the Parts of
the Text. But no Man ought hence to infer, that
the Scriptures of the New Testament then and
now are not the same. And as for the Number
of the Sacred Writers and their Books, it hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

been always the same, <hi>i. e.</hi> the same Catalogue and
Canon have been generally acknowledged and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the Christian Church. It is true, some
Particular Books have been questioned, but by a
few only, and for a time: but the Church was at

Christians agreed to own all those Books which
are now owned by us. All the Eastern Churches
held the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to be Canonical,
though the Latins (it is granted) were not so una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous.

resolved upon mature Deliberation. So that the

of the Truth and Authority of them: they were
once doubted of, that for the future they might
be unquestionable. And to come down to latter
Times; what if two or three Men of late, as <hi>Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingius,

Books of the New Testament Apocryphal? And
what if <hi>Luther</hi> himself seem'd to say as much?
What doth this signify in respect of the universal
and concurrent Judgment of others? And as for
the rest of the Books of the New Testament, they
were never doubted of at all, but have the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of the whole Church.</p>
                     <p>And that the <hi>new Testament</hi> was first written in
<hi>Greek,</hi> as we now receive it, is attested by the
Universal Consent of the Antients, who made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into these things. Only two Books are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by some: for though many of the<note n="‖" place="bottom">Flacius Illyricus, Erasmus, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, Chamier, Lightfoot.</note> Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Moderns maintain that St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Gospel
was written originally in Greek, yet it is not to
be denied that some of the<note n="*" place="bottom">Irenaeus, Origen, Eusebius, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, Augustine.</note> Fathers hold it was
written first in Hebrew, for the sake of the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                        <hi>Ierom,</hi>
the original Hebrew was extant in his time, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46315:44"/>
he translated the Gospel into Latin from that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
Who turn'd it into Greek is not certain; but
it was either by St. <hi>Matthew</hi> himself, or by some
Apostolical Person, inspired by the Holy Ghost;
so that the Greek we now have, is from the same
Spirit, and of the same Authority with the other.
The Fathers likewise generally say that St. <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

                        </hi>
writ the <hi>Epistle to the Hebrews</hi> in their own Tongue,
and that St. <hi>Luke</hi> or St. <hi>Clement</hi> turn'd it into
Greek. The contrary is held by some Moderns,
particularly <hi>Cajetan</hi> among the Romanists, and by
many of the Reformed-Way. But excepting (I
say) these two Books, it is universally agreed that
the whole New Testament was written in Greek;
and one Reason might be, because so great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Jews lived among the Greeks, and used
their Tongue; and therefore this part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was sitly writ in Greek, as the other was long
before translated into that Tongue for the use of
the Jews. For the sake of these dispersed Jews,
(therefore called <hi>the dispersed among the Gentiles,</hi> or
according to the Original, <hi>the Dispersion of the
Greeks,</hi> John 7. 35.) who understood and spake
the Greek Language, the New Testament was put
forth in that Tongue. Moreover, this was the
most generally received Language at that time,
and therefore the fittest for the propagating the
Gospel. This is a very good Argument: for tho

                        <hi>Tully</hi> acquaints us that in all the
Roman Empire <hi>Greek</hi> was vulgarly understood. It
is no wonder therefore that the New Testament
was writ in that Tongue, and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes
not only to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> &amp;c. but to the <hi>Romans</hi>
in Greek, for they all understood it. It was the
Modish and Courtly way of Speech at <hi>Rome,</hi> as
the <hi>French</hi> is now with us. Their very Women
affected to learn and speak Greek, for which they
are jeer'd by the Satyrist, who calls <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Greek
City.</hi> In short, all the Eastern People spoke Greek,
more or less, from the time that <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great and his Captains spread their Dominion in
the East. The <hi>Syrians, Egyptians, Persians,</hi> and
People of the Lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> were acquainted with
that Language. The Jews of any considerable
Quality understood Greek as well as their own
Tongue: whence <hi>Iosephus,</hi> a Jewish Priest, (or of
the Priestly Stock) writ his Books in <hi>Greek.</hi> The
Evangelists and Apostles then might well write in
the same Tongue, it being so common and every
where understood. Especially it is no wonder on
another account, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> writ in Greek; for
it was his native Tongue, he being of <hi>Tarsus,</hi> which
was a City of <hi>Greece.</hi> We may then very justly
look upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Language as the Original Text
of the New Testament.</p>
                     <p>And it is generally agreed that these Greek Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
which we now have and use, are True and
Authentick, though in some things they differ:
and none are observed to oppose this but those
who do it upon some Interest and Design, <hi>i. e.</hi> to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46315:45"/>
maintain some peculiar Opinion which they have
taken up. <hi>The Variety of Readings</hi> should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
us: much less ought we to alter the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Copies, and to substitute new ones at
our pleasure. Which is the Fault of <hi>Theodore Beza<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
though on other accounts an Excellent Person, and
one that hath highly deserved of the Church of
God: yet he is unsufferably bold in coining new
Readings of the Text. When he cannot find the
Sense of a Place, he presently questions the Truth
of the Copy, and produceth a new Reading;
which hath brought a great Scandal upon his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations
on the New Testament, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
are fraught with admirable Learning, and
discover his profound Skill in Divine Criticism.
It is certain that the Greek and Latin Manuscripts
which he pretends to, are a Cheat: for questionless
they would have been taken notice of in the first
Ages of Christianity, if there had been any such
thing. Therefore it is downright Imposture, and
<hi>Beza</hi> was grosly deluded by it. Let us from his
Miscarriage, learn to be cautious, and not to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
so boldly upon altering the Greek Copies.
This is a very rash and unaccountable Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
especially in a single Person, and much more
when it is very usual and frequent.</p>
                     <p>To speak next both of <hi>the Old and New Testament
together.</hi> The Authority of them is established by
considering this, that though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others
of the Roman Communion (who are followed by
<hi>Lewis Cappel,</hi> and some others that go under the
Name of <hi>Protestants)</hi> cry out that the Bible is alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and corrupted by the Negligence of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers,
and that the Text is uncertain by reason
of the different Readings and Variety of Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46315:45"/>
(which is done out of design, <hi>viz.</hi> to debase
the Authority of the holy Writings, and to make
Men fly to Traditions, and rest wholly in the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Church, and (I wish I might not
add) thereby to undermine some of the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Religion;) yet this is certain, that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Readings of the Old and New Testament are
not so many as are pretended; and all the various
Copies in Hebrew and Greek, which are found in
all Nations at this Day, do agree in all material
Points; and the Scriptures being translated from
those Copies into many Languages, concur in the
same substantial things. Again, as to those vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Readings which are produced, we may justly
alledg the Words of an<note n="*" place="bottom">Bp of <hi>Cork</hi>'s Discourse of the Authority of Scripture.</note> Excellent Man; <hi>They are
not Arguments,</hi> saith he, <hi>of the Scriptures Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but of God's Providence, and of Human Industry
to preserve Scripture from Corruption.</hi> We may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from this Diversity of Readings, that Men
have been very inquisitive and careful in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
of Copies; but we cannot thence argue,
that the Text is adulterated; yea rather we may
infer that it is not: for from this comparing and
vying of Copies, we come to know and be ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
which is the True and Authentick one.
And we may farther add, with the same excellent
Author, <q>That it is morally impossible, since
our Saviour's time, and indeed for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years before that, that the Scriptures
(particularly of the Old Testament) should have
been corrupted: for the Multitude of Copies
was then such, hath been since much more such,
and so far dispersed, that neither one Man, nor
one Body of Men could ever get them into their

Again, let it be consider'd that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Orthodox Writers of the Church do all ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
these Scriptures as we now have them, in every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
material: Yea, that most <hi>Hereticks</hi> have
pleaded these same Scriptures, and denied them
not to be genuine. To establish us yet further,
we must remember that these Writings have been
openly read to the People in all their solemn As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
in the several Ages since Christianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan;
and they being thus constantly used, could
not possibly be altered and corrupted: Besides
that, all private Christians were exhorted to read
and use them in their Families; whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
so known and familiar, that whenever any
Alteration was made, they could presently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it. Lastly, notwithstanding the Author of a
<note n="*" place="bottom">Tractat. Theologico-Politic.</note> late <hi>Tractate</hi> hath brought divers Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the usual Tradition, that such and such Books
of the Bible were wrote by the Authors whose
Names they bear; and though Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> before
him had done the same, yet neither of them have
effected it with any Success. This is all they have
done; they have only shewed that they are not so
civil to the holy Writings as they are to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
ones: for it is every whit as clear that the
Books of the Holy Scripture were written by the
Persons under whose Names they go, as that any
other Writings were put out by those whose
Names they bear. Nor can these Men vouchsafe
to shew that Civility to these Sacred Books, which
even <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> have done: for when both

                        </gap>hese opposed these Books, you will not find that
they ever questioned the <hi>Authors,</hi> but the <hi>Doctrine</hi>
only. We are therefore to look upon these Men,
and such as take part with them, as acting with
higher Prejudice than either Jews or Heathens did;
and accordingly we are to slight what they say,
unless it be thus far, that from their impotent and
malicious Cavils we may be further confirmed in
this Perswasion, that these Books of the Old and
New Testament were indeed written by those
Authors, under whose Names they are now recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
that these Scriptures which we now have,
are the same which the Primitive Church received
from the Apostles; that the Copies we have of the
Bible, are not corrupted; that God hath preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Scriptures both of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
from all considerable Change and Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
(his Providence not suffering any such
thing;) that the Canon of Scripture which is now
received, is the very same that it was at first; and
(which is the Sum of all) that the Truth and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of it are impregnable.</p>
                     <p>It may be expected I should speak of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

reason; for I find them excluded from the Canon
of Scripture by those that are the best Judges of
it, I mean the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were the great Keepers
of the Scripture. They never took these into the
number of the Books of Holy Writ, and that for
these two Reasons: First, because they were not
writ by the <hi>Prophets.</hi> The Jews believed that the
Spirit of Prophecy ceased among them as soon as
<hi>Malachi</hi> had done prophesying. They owned no
Divine Inspiration after his time, and accordingly

quote the Canonical Books, never quo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
any of the Apocryphal ones: which gives us to
understand that they were not reputed as Inspired
Writings: otherwise it is most reasonable to think
that our Saviour, or his Apostles and Evangelists,
would at one time or other have cited some one
Passage at least out of these Books; it being their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46315:47"/>
great Work (as you may see) to prove the Truth
of what they delivered from the holy Scriptures,
which were inspired by God in former Times.
They embraced all Occasions of establishing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
upon the Writings of the Inspired Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
who went before: therefore if the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
Writers had been of that number, they would
certainly have been quoted by them; and because
they are not, it is an Argument that they are not
Inspired Writers. Again, the Christian Church,
which immediately succeeded that which was in
the Days of Christ and the Apostles, received not
these Writings as Divinely inspired, and therefore
excluded them from the Canon of Scripture. Look
into the Writings of the antient Fathers of the
Church, (who without doubt made it their business
to search into the Canon of Scripture, and to be
satisfied which were the Divinely inspired Books)
and there you will see that those of the Eastern
Church received only the Jews Canon of Scripture
as to the Old Testament. Thus<note n="*" place="bottom">

but leaves out the Apocryphal ones. This
Canon was received afterwards, and confirmed by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46315:48"/>
the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> one of the first four Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Councils. And the sixth General Council,
held at <hi>Constantinople, A. D.</hi> 680. expresly ratified
the Decrees of that old Laodicean Council, and
particularly this, that the Canonical Books of the
Old Testament were but two and twenty. There
is another Reason also, besides the Universal Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
of the Christian Church, why the Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
Books are ejected out of the Canon, <hi>viz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some things in them are false, and contrary
to the Canonical Scriptures, as in <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> 46.
20. 2 <hi>Esdras</hi> 6. 40. and some things are vitious,
as in 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 14. 42.</p>
                     <p>After all this it is easy to answer what the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists
say on the other side. They quote the
third Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> which they tell us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Apocryphal Books into the Canon. And
among the Fathers, St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> they say, owns
them: besides that two Popes, <hi>viz. Innocent</hi> the
First and <hi>Gelasius,</hi> took those Books, which we stile
Apocryphal, into the Canon. As for the <hi>Council</hi>
which they alledg, it was but a Provincial one,
and therefore is not to be set against those more
Authentick and General Councils which I produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
Nor must that one single <hi>Father</hi> whom they
name, stand out against that great number of
Greek and Latin Fathers whom I mentioned. The
<hi>Popes</hi> bear a great Name among our Adversaries,
but they are but two, and must not be compared
with those Councils, and that multitude of Fathers
who are on our side. Or, if they lay such great
stress on a Pope, I can name them one, and he one
of the most eminent they ever had, <hi>viz.</hi> Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi>

You see what Ground we have, no other

as <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> because they were generally rejected

For this Reason, I say, we bear great
Respect to them, and rank them next to the Holy
Canon, and prefer them before all Profane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
This was done by the antient Fathers,
who frequently alledg'd them in their Sermons and
Discourses: which is one Reason (I question not)
why these Apocryphal Books came to be made
Canonical by some of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because they were so often quoted by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and in some Churches read publickly. But
this is no Proof of their being <hi>Canonical,</hi> but only
lets us know that these Books were in their Kind
useful and profitable, as indeed they are. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
St.<note n="*" place="bottom">Praefat. in libr. Proverb.</note> 
                        <hi>Ierom</hi> saith, the <hi>Church receives not these
Books into the Canon of Scripture, though she allows
them to be read.</hi> And concerning these Writings
our Church saith well, (quoting St. <hi>Ierom</hi> for it)
<note n="†" place="bottom">Artic. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>She doth read them for Example of Life, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Manners, but yet doth not apply them to
establish any Doctrine.</hi> Which gives us an exact
account of the Nature of these Books; namely,
that they contain excellent Rules of Life, and are
very serviceable to inform us of our Duty as to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
weighty things: but they being not dictated
by the Holy Ghost, as the other Books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are, they are not the infallible Standard of
Divine Doctrine, and therefore are not to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
and made use of to that purpose. This and
the other Reasons before mentioned, may prevail
with us to think that these Writings ought not to
be numbred among the Books of Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="tcp:46315:50"/>
And thus we have argued from the <hi>Tradition,</hi>
and the <hi>Testimony of the Church.</hi> And if this be
done as it ought to be done, it is valid: for the
Truth of the Copies, the Canonicalness of the
Books, and the like, are not decidable by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it self, but in the Way that all other Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
of that nature are. As you would prove
any other Book to be Authentick, so you must
prove the Bible to be, <hi>viz.</hi> by sufficient and able
Testimony. There is the same reason to believe
the Sacred History, that there is to believe any
other Historical Writings that are extant. Nay,
the Testimonies on behalf of the Holy Scripture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,
are more pregnant than any that are brought for
other Writings. Besides all that can be said for
the Sacred Volume of the Bible, which is wont to
be said for other Writings, I have shewed you that
there are some things peculiar to this above a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
others. The main thing we have insisted upon is
this, that the Books of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
have been faithfully conveyed to us; and
that they are vouched by the constant and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Tradition both of the Jewish and Christian
Church; and that these Books, and no others, are
of the <hi>Canon</hi> of Scripture: for to be of the <hi>Canon</hi>
of Scripture, is no other than to be owned by the
Universal Church for Divinely Inspired Writings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
The Church witnesseth and confirmeth the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Canonical Scriptures; for she received
them as Divine, and she delivers them to us as such
Yet I do not say that the Church's Testifying these
Books to be the Holy Scriptures, gives an <hi>Absolute</hi>
and <hi>Entire</hi> Authority to them. A Clerk in the
Parliament, or any other Court, writes down and
testi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ies that such an Act, or Decree, or Order,
was pass'd by the King, Magistrate or People;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46315:50"/>
and he witnesses that he hath faithfully kept these
by him, and that they are the very same that at
such a time were made by the foresaid Authority:
but the Authority of this Act, Decree or Order,
rests not in the Clerk, but wholly in the King, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
or People. So the Church recordeth and
keepeth the Sacred Writings of the Bible, and
bears witness that they have been faithfully preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and that they are the Genuine Writings of
those Persons whose Names are presixed to them:

                        </gap>t the Divine Authority of the Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
not on the Church, but on the Books and
Authors themselves, namely their being Inspired.
And indeed this Authority of the Scriptures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
depend on the Church, because the Church it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
depends on the Scriptures. These must be
proved before the Church can pretend to be any
such thing as a Church. We cannot know the
Church but by the Scriptures; therefore the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
must be known before the Church. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
then that the Papists are very unreasonable
and absurd in making the Ultimate Resolution of
Faith to be into the Testimony and Authority of
the Church. This we disown as a great Falsity;
but yet it is rational to hold that the Church's Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
is one good Argument and Proof of the
Truth of the Sacred Scripture: according to that
known Saying of St. <hi>Augustine, I should not believe
the Gospel, if the Authority of the Church did not move
me.</hi> Not that he founds the Gospel, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christianity, and the Truth of it, on the
Testimony of the Church; as the Papists are wont
to infer from these Words, and frequently quote
them to this purpose. No: the Father's meaning
is this, that by the Testimony and Consent of the
Church he believed the Book of the Gospel to be
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:46315:51"/>
verily that Book which was written by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists.
This is the Sense of the Place, as is plain
from the Scope of it; for he speaks there of the
Copies or Writings, not the Doctrine contained
in them. The good Father relies on this, that so
great a number of knowing and honest Persons as
the Church was made up of, did assert the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Writings to be the Writings of such as
were really inspired by the Holy Ghost; and
that they were true and genuine, and not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.
And the whole Body of Sacred Scripture
is attested by the same universal Suffrage of the
Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> the unanimous Consent of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and of the First Christians, and of those that
immediately succeeded them; several of which
laid down their Lives to vindicate the Truth of
these Writings. This is the <hi>External Testimony</hi>
given to the Holy Scriptures. It is the general
Perswasion and Attestation of the Antient Church,
that these are the Scriptures of Truth; that they
were penn'd by holy Prophets and Apostles, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
directed by the Spirit, who therefore
could not err. It was usual heretofore among the
Pagan Lawgivers to attribute their Laws to some
Deity, tho they were of their own Invention; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
thereby to conciliate Reverence to them,
and to commend them to the People. But here is
no such Cheat put upon us: God himself is really
the Author of the Holy Scriptures; these Sacred
Laws come immediately from Him, they are of
Divine Inspiration. There is no doubt to be made
of the Divinity of the Scriptures, and consequently
there is assurance of the Infallibility of them.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>The Authority of the Bible manifested from the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of Enemies and Strangers, especially of
Pagans. These confirm what the Old Testament
saith concerning the Creation, the Production of
Adam and Eve, their Fall, with the several Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of it; Enoch's Translation, the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gevity
of the Patriarchs, the Giants in those
Times, the Universal Flood, the building of the
Tower of Babel.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Have propounded some of the chief Arguments
which may induce us to believe the Truth and
Certainty of the holy Writings of the Old and
New Testament. I will now choose out another,
for the sake chiefly of the Learned and Curious,
which I purpose to inlarge upon; yea, to make the
Subject of my whole ensuing Discourse. I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
then that we have in this Matter not only the
Testimony of Friends, but of <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:</hi>
and it is a Maxim in the Civil Law, and
vouched by all Men of Reason, that the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of an Enemy is most considerable. The <hi>Iewish</hi>
and <hi>Christian Church,</hi> as I have shewed already,
give their Testimony to the Scriptures: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these Witnesses there are <hi>Others,</hi> there is the
Attestation of Foreigners and Adversaries. These
fully testify the Truth of what is delivered in the
Holy Bible: we have the Approbation of <hi>Heathen
Writers</hi> to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>irm many of the things related in
the <hi>Old Testament;</hi> and both Professed <hi>Heathens</hi>
and <hi>Iews</hi> (for we must now look upon these latter
as profess'd <hi>Enemies,</hi> when we are to speak of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:46315:52"/>
Christian Concern) attest sundry things of the
<hi>New Testament,</hi> and vouch the Truth and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of them. Here then I will distinctly proceed,
and first begin with the Old Testament, and let
you see in several Particulars, that even the <hi>Pagan
World</hi> gives Testimony to this Sacred Volume;
that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> relate the very same things that
this doth; that the <hi>Great Truths,</hi> and <hi>Notable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
Notions</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> in the Books of the
Old Testament, are to be met with in Profane
Writings, but taken from these Sacred ones. The
<hi>Heathens</hi> borrowed many of their <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Vsages</hi>
from Traditions which were founded in the Holy
Scriptures. They derived many things in their
Religion and Manners from these Sacred Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
though it is as true that they have laboured
to pollute them. But I will make it clear and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
that they fetch'd them thence; and I will
abundantly prove that most of the chief things in
the Old Testament have been attested both by the
<hi>Fables,</hi> and the <hi>Serious History</hi> of the Pagans. There
have been some High-fliers, I know, who have
carried on this Notion to a ridiculous Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

and his sailing from <hi>Troy</hi> to <hi>Latium,</hi> was the

                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:46315:52"/>
and going to <hi>Rome. Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Heroick
Poems are an account of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the Church,
and of the Shipwrack and Misfortunes which this
latter meets with in the World. <hi>Ilium</hi> or <hi>Aelia</hi>
is <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> that was the Name which <hi>Aelius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianus</hi>
gave it. The Acts of the Apostles, the
Jewish War, and the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> are
contain'd in <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Iliads;</hi> and so are the Life and

us that <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus</hi> signify the Apostles
St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Founders of the Roman
Church. And more extravagantly yet he goes
on, telling us that <hi>Diana</hi> signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And a great deal more of such Stuff this <hi>Hugo</hi>
hath, which no Man of Consideration and Sense is
able to bear. Indeed such wild and far-fetch'd
Conceits may be justly entertain'd with Laughter
and Contempt. Nor do I look upon some things

Life:</hi> which was interpreted as if humane Souls

                     <p>The making of <hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>Adam,</hi> was also ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely
intimated in what <hi>Plato</hi> saith in his <hi>Sympo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sium,</hi>
namely, that the first Man was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
a Mixture of both Sexes. Which Fable of his was
from the Jewish Tradition, that the first Man was
made an <hi>Hermaphrodite;</hi> that he had two Bodies
join'd together, one of a Male, another of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male;
and that God afterwards split him into two
distinct Bodies, whence arose Man and Woman.
If the Jewish Rabbies (who were better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Scripture) talk'd after this doting rate,
<hi>Plato</hi> may well be excused, who perhaps had it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on Tradition, and had not the Means to correct
his Mistakes which they had. But this is plain,
that this Fable is a Corruption of the Sacred Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which speaking of our First Parents, saith,
<note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. 5. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>God called their Name Adam;</hi> as if their having
but One Name, signified they were but One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
and again in the same Verse, <hi>Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
created he them;</hi> as if the first Man, who is
spoken of in the Verse immediately foregoing,
consisted of a double Sex. But it is evident that
the Words relate to both; and the reason why
the Name <hi>Adam</hi> is given to both, is because they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46315:60"/>
were both of them from the <hi>Earth,</hi> one immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
the other remotely: but afterwards we
read that they had distinct Names, <hi>Adam</hi> being
appropriated to the Man, and <hi>Eve</hi> to the Woman.
And this ridiculous Fable which <hi>Plato</hi> had pick'd
up, might be occasioned likewise from a misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of that Text,<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 2. 21, 22.</note> 
                        <hi>God took one of the
Man's Ribs, and out of it made he a Woman.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Woman was formed out of the Man's
Side, they inferr'd that <hi>Adam</hi> was at first both
Man and Woman, and that the Woman at her
first Make stuck to his Side. Which is a gross
mistaking of the Text, but confirms the Truth
and Antiquity of that Book of <hi>Moses,</hi> which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us of <hi>Eve</hi>'s Formation out of <hi>Adam,</hi> which
was the thing that gave rise to this erroneous Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                     <p>May we not think that <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Dominion over the
Beasts,</hi> which was accompanied with his <hi>Calling
them,</hi> and <hi>giving them Names,</hi> was the Foundation
of what the Poets talk of <hi>Orpheus</hi>'s drawing the
Beasts after him, and making them Tame, and
causing them to stand still, and as it were answer
to their Names? Or else it was a Representation

the <hi>Ark</hi> at <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Call,</hi> which is a Confirmation
of another known Passage in the Mosaick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
But I am not positive here, and in some
such-like Passages which occur in the Poets: tho
in others I shall heap up several plain and evident
Circumstances, sufficient to convince the Reader
that they have reference to something spoken of
in Scripture. As to <hi>Adam's giving of Names to all
things,</hi> mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 19. it appears that <hi>Plato</hi>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:46315:60"/>
was not a stranger to it; for in his<note n="*" place="bottom">Or, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Cratylus,</hi>
where it is disputed whether Words signify by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
or from Nature, he first denies the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of his Grecians to have been the Original
one, (as in<note n="†" place="bottom">In Timaeo.</note> another place he calls his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
the Greeks, <hi>Youths</hi> and <hi>Striplings of yesterday,</hi>
and consequently their Language was not the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientest)
and then he hints that <hi>Hebrew</hi> was the
Original Tongue; which is meant by what is said,
Gen. 11. 1. that <hi>the whole Earth was of one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and of one Speech.</hi> And though he conceals
the Name of the <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Hebrews,</hi> yet when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
affirms in this <hi>Dialogue,</hi> that the right Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Names,</hi> and their Interpretation, are to
be fetch'd from the<note n="‖" place="bottom">

                        <hi>Barbarians, as the more anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>

                        </hi>
by the Greeks (as these were so by them.)
And hence I gather that <hi>Plato</hi> and other Heathens
knew, and perhaps had read, that <hi>Adam gave
Names, proper and significant Names, to all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi>
which <hi>Moses</hi> particularly makes mention of,
and must be the very thing that is here meant by
<hi>Plato,</hi> when he acknowledgeth that the true Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies

Regions of Happiness above, and became <hi>Devils</hi>
by their own voluntary opposing of God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
his Government? Next, we have good
Records among the Pagans of the Fall it self of
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> especially of the latter, because
she was <hi>first</hi> and most eminent <hi>in the Transgression,</hi>
(as the Apostle speaks) and was the cause of the
Man's defection from his Duty. She is represented
by<note n="*" place="bottom">Iliad. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Ate,</hi> whom incensed <hi>Iupiter</hi> thrust
down from Heaven, threatning that she should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be restored to that Place again. Though some
have thought that this might refer to the <hi>Apostate
Angels</hi> (of whom before), because it is common
with the Poets to imply Many when they mention
but One Person; and so here, though One be said
to be cast down from Heaven, yet it may intimate
to us the Fall of all the cursed Crew of Wicked
Angels. But it is more natural, I think, to apply
this Story (it being of the Female Sex) to our
Grandmother <hi>Eve:</hi> for what the Poets tell us of
<hi>Ate, viz.</hi> that she was the first-born Daughter of
<hi>Iupiter,</hi> and that she was that pernicious Woman
that brought Mischief on the whole Race of Man,
exactly agrees to her, so that there is no need of
explaining it. It is not to be doubted that our
first Parent <hi>Eve</hi> was also meant by <hi>Pandora,</hi> whom
<hi>Hesiod</hi> and others of the Antients mention, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting
us, that out of her deadly Box which
she gave to <hi>Epimetheus,</hi> flew all Evil into the World,
and thereby she became the Original of all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable

I speak not this, as if I did not think they might

who had it from <hi>Manes</hi> their Founder, a Persian;
and he received this Opinion from his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
the Persians, who were Gentiles. These two

It prevail'd among the antient Grecians, whose
two distinct Principles were <hi>Iupiter Olympius</hi> and
<hi>Hades.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> too had their <hi>Typho,</hi> the
Evil Principle, and <hi>Isis,</hi> or <hi>Osir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>,</hi> the Good one.
The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> had the same Notion of a Contrary
Cause of Good and Evil, holding some Planets
(which were their Gods) to be productive of all
the Good, others of all the Evil among them.
This antient Tradition of the Pagans so generally
received, was, I suppose, derived from what is
recorded in the first Entrance of the Bible, <hi>viz.</hi>
that <hi>God</hi> was the bountiful Author of all Good to
Man, not only creating him of nothing, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him his Being, but placing him in a State of
Happiness, and conferring all Felicity upon him:
but on the contrary, the <hi>Devil</hi> was the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of Evil, tempting our first Parents to Sin,
whereby they lost all their Happiness, and fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Curse, and were expell'd out of Paradise;
and afterwards all Evils and Mischiefs came upon
the World for their sake. Hence arose among the
deluded Heathens that Twofold Principle <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Daemon,</hi> or rather Two Opposite Gods; for the
true Tradition was corrupted into an absurd and
irrational Opinion among the Gentiles of two
Anti-Gods.</p>
                     <p>There was also this Circumstance of the History
of Man's Fall among the Heathens, that <hi>the Devil
appear'd in the likeness of a Serpent.</hi> Preparatory to
which is that which <hi>Plato</hi> saith, (as he is quoted
by<note n="*" place="bottom">Praepar. Evang. lib. 12, 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Euscbius)</hi> that in <hi>Saturn's</hi> days the Folks <hi>could

                     <p>IV. From the Fall of Man till after the Confusion
and Dispersion at <hi>Babel,</hi> there are many considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things spoken of by Pagans, which they could
not have any notice of but from the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>Enoch</hi>'s being taken up by God (together
with the Translation of <hi>Elias</hi> afterwards) gave
occasion to the Stories of their <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

and ascending to Heaven alive, and being turn'd
into Stars and Celestial Signs: as also the <hi>Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osis</hi>
among the Gentiles might be founded on this.
Again, the Testimony of the Pagans concerning
the <hi>Long Lives of the People of the first Age of the
World,</hi> was plainly, without any Disguise, taken
from the Sacred History. <q>All that have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto writing the Antiquities either of
the Greeks or Barbarians, attest this Longevity
of the Men before the Flood, saith<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiqu. I. 1. c. 4.</note>

the Daughters of Men.</hi> This I verily think is the

                     <p>To proceed. <hi>Berosus</hi> the Chaldean Priest and

saith, i. e. according to his way of speaking,
all the <hi>Pagan Historians</hi> have made mention of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s
Flood. If the Credit of these Writers now
named be called in question, (as I confess they are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46315:68"/>
by some) there is abundant mention of that <hi>Flood,</hi>
and of several Circumstances belonging to it, in
others, whose Writings are not suspected. In
<hi>Lucian</hi>'s <hi>Dea Syria</hi> are most of the Particulars
which are recorded in the sixth and seventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Genesis</hi> concerning that <hi>Deluge:</hi> as first, the
Natural Cause of it, the excessive Rain or Fall of
Waters from Heaven, and the opening of the
Fountains below: then the Moral Cause of it, the
Corruption and Wickedness of the World. The
People at that time kept not their Oaths, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
not Strangers, were hard-hearted to those
who were in Distress; they were every ways viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and profligate, and thereby merited this great
Judgment. Next, there is mentioned the Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, with the Manner
of their being preserved, namely by sheltering
themselves in a Great Ark; and thus he and his
Wife and Children were reserved for a Second Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
This befel <hi>Noah</hi> because of his great
Prudence and singular Piety, as this Author adds.
With him entred into the Ark two of every sort
of Animals; and being shut up in that safe Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
they all sailed together without any Harm,
nay with a great Friendship and Concord. Lastly,
<hi>Noah</hi>'s erecting an Altar after he came out of the
Ark, is expresly taken notice of. These are the
things, saith he, which the Greeks relate out of
their Archives of the <hi>Flood.</hi> All which you will
find to be like the Narrative of <hi>Moses,</hi> only <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calion</hi>

the Flood, which the Holy Scripture hath given us

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omachy
of the Giants, was derived from what the
History of <hi>Moses</hi> relates in <hi>Gen. 11. 3, &amp;c.</hi> that
<hi>Nimrod,</hi> a great Hunter, a Giant-like Man, with
his sturdy Fellows, attempted to <hi>build a City and
Tower, whose Top should reach up to Heaven;</hi> which
the Pagans interpreted to be Defying of the Gods,
and making War with them. And truly they
did not come short of the true Meaning of their
grand Design; which was to defy Heaven, and to
exalt and magnify themselves: Though I grant it
was Hyperbolically spoken when they said, <hi>Let <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
build us a City and Tower to reach up to Heaven;</hi> for
they could not dream of performing this in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
because they knew the Height of the late
Flood (which lifted up the Ark fifteen Cubits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the highest Mountains) was short of Heaven:
besides, they would not have built on the Plain,
(as they did) but on the highest Hills, if they had
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46315:72"/>
had any such Project in their Heads. Nor was it to
be a Refuge from the Waters of another Flood;
for they had God's Word for it that no such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
should ever be again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 15. But their
Design is plainly set down, <hi>chap. 11. ver. 4. Let us
make us a Name, lest we be scatter'd abroad on the face
of the whole Earth; i. e.</hi> Let us go about this Work,
that we may have here a Place to six in; that by
erecting this vast City and Tower, we may have
room enough, and live together in one Body; and
make our Lusts our only Law, and act as we please,
without the Controul of others: and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
when by reason of our great Numbers, and
Increase, we must be forced to remove, we may
by this famous Monument be known; and when
we leave this World, we may hereby purchase a
Name in future Ages, and even survive after
Death. Thus their Intentions and Enterprizes
were prophane and impious, and no less than an
arrogant Contempt of God. But some of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
interpreting the foresaid Words in a gross
Manner, as if those daring Sinners did actually
scale the Heavens, have presented us with their
Conceits upon this remarkable Occurrence; but
as to the main, it must be acknowledg'd that they
confirm the Truth of the Sacred History. And
even this last Particular, <hi>the making them a Name,</hi>
seems to be transcribed into the Fable, when they
tell us, that after the Giants, who were begot of
the Earth, had fought the Gods, their Mother
Earth (being incens'd at the Defeat of her Sons)
brought forth <hi>Fame:</hi> This was the Giants last Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,

made a Covenant with him, he commanded him to
divide a Heifer, a Goat, and a Ram into pieces,
and to pass between them. Whence afterward
this Ceremony was made use of when a League or
Covenant was entred into between Man and
Man: and the Parties did as it were declare by
that Action, that they wished to be cut asunder

It is not improbable that <hi>Abraham's Feasting the
Angels,</hi> yea, the <hi>Son of God himself,</hi> (Gen. 18. 8.)
gave occasion to the Poets to speak of <hi>the Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
feasted</hi> by Mortals, as they tell us of <hi>Philemon</hi>
and <hi>Baucis,</hi> their entertaining of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi>
which is but a corrupt Representation of
<hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Treating their Heavenly
Guests. And here I might add, that from this
and other Instances in the Old Testament, of the
frequent and visible Appearing of God and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
unto Men, as to <hi>Isaac, Iacob, Moses, Gideon,
Manoah,</hi> and several others; and from their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
of Bodies of Humane Shape in order to
that, there arose a Notion among the Pagans, that
their Gods forsooth vouchsafed sometimes to come
down and visit them in the likeness of Mortals.
Thence <hi>Homer</hi> and other Poets so commonly talk
of the Apparition of the Gods in sensible Shapes,
and bring them in after that manner. Thence it
was that the People of <hi>Lystra,</hi> in the lesser <hi>Asia,</hi>
cried out that <hi>the Gods were come down to them in
the likeness of Men,</hi> (Acts 14. 12.) and upon this
Apprehension, they were preparing to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to them, and had got the Priests ready
with their Oxen and Garlands for that end. Nay,
thence it was that some of the Poets made those
mad Fables of the strange Metamorphosis of their
Gods: as how <hi>Apollo</hi> took on him the Shape of a
Hawk, of a Lion, and of a Shepherd; how <hi>Bacchus</hi>
appear'd like a Grape for <hi>Erigone</hi>'s sake; how
<hi>Neptune</hi> chang'd himself into a Flying Horse for
<hi>Medusa</hi>'s Love, and into a Steer, a Ram, a Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin

<hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and the

deliver it as their Opinion, that this Unhappy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was converted into a Mass or Solid Body of
Hardned Salt, such as the Mineral one is. This
being so remarkable a thing, it could not but be
snatch'd up by the Inquisitive Poets among the
Greeks; and accordingly they tell us of <hi>Niobe</hi>'s
being turn'd into a Stone for her refractory Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of some Goddess's Commands. This Fable,
as may be conjectured, was taken from <hi>Lot</hi>'s <hi>Wife</hi>
turn'd into a hard, and as 'twere stony Pillar, for
her disbelieving the Threatnings of God to the
Sodomites, and for despising the express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

what think you of the Fable of <hi>Orpheus</hi>'s <hi>Wife,</hi> his
dear <hi>Euridice?</hi> To fetch her back again to Life,
he went to Hell; here he perswaded <hi>Pluto</hi> to give
him her again, but upon this condition, that he
should not look back to her all the while she was
coming. But it seems the kind Man turned to
look on his Wife as she was following him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
she was remanded back to Hell. Here seems
to be an Allusion to <hi>Lot</hi>'s <hi>Wife,</hi> and to her <hi>looking
back,</hi> and to the <hi>sad Effect of it. Orpheus</hi> is <hi>Lot,
Euridice</hi> is <hi>his Wife, Sodom is Hell,</hi> and the <hi>Fire and

worshipp'd their Asses. And a poor Fiction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it had been, if 'twere on that account: for
if they had not rid upon them, but have kept them

                        </gap>
and composed Thoughts. There is yet another
Opinion which I have met with somewhere, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:46315:83"/>
that the Gentiles thought the Jews worshipp'd an
Ass because of that Law in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 20. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>the redeeming the first-born of an Ass.</hi> This A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal
being exempted from Sacrifice, when Calves
and Lambs and Kids were not, it might seem to
be some excellent thing, and therefore was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp'd.
But according to this way of inferring,
the Pagans might have reported that the Jews
worshipp'd a Dog, there being a particular Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
against offering it in Sacrifice. Besides, this
Account (like that before mentioned) hath not
any of the Circumstances with which the Fable is
clothed in Pagan Writers, as that it was an <hi>Ass's
Head</hi> that was worshipp'd, and that by means of
it a Spring of Water was found out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
we ought particularly to consider when we are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an account of this Pagan Taunt against the
Jews.</p>
                     <p>Lastly then, to offer a Conjecture of my own,
I am strongly inclined to think this Calumny of the
Heathens against the Jews arose from the <hi>History of
Samson,</hi> in which is particular mention of <hi>the Iaw-bone
of an Ass,</hi> and of the strange things done by it,
<hi>Iudg. 15. 15, 16. Samson</hi> (as you shall hear anon)
was famous among the Pagans, his Actions were
noted and celebrated among them. And this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Action and Exploit of the <hi>Iaw-bone,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he slew a thousand Men, being singular and
wonderful, was well known to them; especially
it came to be famous and talk'd of, when there
was this surprizing Miracle added to it, that when
<hi>Samson</hi> was exceedingly tormented with Thirst,
and like to die for want of something to quench it,
<hi>God clave a hollow Place that was in the Iaw, and there
came Water thereout; and when he had drunk, his
Spirit came again, and he revived,</hi> ver. 18, 19. Here
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46315:84"/>
was the <hi>Iaw-bone</hi> of an Ass, which was a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part of the <hi>Head of an Ass.</hi> The minding
of this gave the first occasion to me to think that
the Tradition among the Pagans was taken from
this: for if you consult those Writers who make
mention of it, you will find the Report was, that
the Jews worshipp'd the <hi>Head of an Ass.</hi> So we
read in a<note n="*" place="bottom">Appion contr. Jud.</note> virulent Writer against the Jews, that
that <hi>particular Part,</hi> and no other, was set up in
the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and Religiously venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by that People; and that <hi>Antiochus</hi> took it
down, and carried it away with him, (it being of

From the first Verse it appears that the Gentiles
thought the Jews worshipp'd Swine, perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they abstain'd from eating their Flesh; for
among the Gentiles, what they did not eat, was
generally worshipp'd. And in the next Verse
there is is a mistake of <hi>coeli</hi> for <hi>cilli,</hi> i. e. <hi>asini,</hi> (as
some Criticks have well observ'd) for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is
the Dorick word for an <hi>Ass:</hi> so that as before the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:46315:84"/>
Poet chargeth the Jews with worshipping of Swine,
so here he alludes to that flying Story among the
Pagans, that that Nation reverenced an <hi>Ass's Head;</hi>
for <hi>auriculae</hi> is put here for <hi>caput,</hi> which could not
stand in the Verse; the prominent and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
Parts of the Head are put for the Head it
self. And if they worshipp'd the Ears, because a
part of the Head, then they paid the same Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the Cheeks, to the Jaws, and to the Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,
which is a more solid Part. None of the
Authors of the foregoing Opinions have attended
to this, that it was the <hi>Head of an Ass,</hi> (not an
Ass in general) that was said to be worshipp'd by
the Jews; and thence arose their Mistakes. Let
it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> be noted therefore, that this was the scurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Reflection of the Pagans on the Jews, that
they gave Religious Honour to <hi>the Head of an Ass:</hi>
and let it be observed at the same time, that it
was an <hi>Ass's Head</hi> which <hi>Samson</hi> found, and so
bravely managed, though it was one particular
Part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Iaw-bone,</hi> with which he did
execution on his Enemies. Wherefore I offer it as
a probable Assertion, that the Report concerning
the Jewish People <hi>reverencing of an Ass's Head,</hi> took
its rise from that prodigious Exploit of <hi>Samson,</hi>
that strange Execution which he did with the <hi>Iaw-bone
of an Ass.</hi> This gave occasion to the Israelites
to extol and magnify that marvellous Weapon,
and at the same time the Providence of God in
administring such an unexpected Engine to him,
and enabling him to do such great things with it.
The neighbouring Gentiles soon heard of this, and
spread abroad this Rumour, that the Hebrews ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
and worshipp'd the Ass's Head or Jaw;
and it is likely they thought they really did so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they themselves used to make any thing the

made their Prayers to God. But this was in
common to them with the Pagan Worshippers,
who naturally had this Posture of Devotion, and
cast up their Eyes, and spread out their Hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heaven: therefore this could not be the
occasion of this Imputation. But there is another
Opinion which I find most applauded, and it is
this, that this Obloquy of the Heathens proceeded
from their mistaking the use of the word <hi>Shamajim,
Heavens</hi> among the Hebrews, and even in the
Scripture it self, where sometimes it signifies <hi>God

the Heavens do rule,</hi> where <hi>the Heavens</hi> import God

the Jews were Worshippers of the Heavens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in this one single place, and no where else,
<hi>God</hi> is call'd <hi>Heaven.</hi> And though I grant the

that if the Jews worshipp'd one Cloud,

this to be consider'd, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

the Israelites in their Travels, be not here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by this Poet, seeing <hi>Farnaby</hi> in his Notes,
and others before him, acquaint us that this Verse
in some Copies is read thus;
<q>Nil praeter Nubes, &amp; Coeli lumen adorant.</q>
Where by <hi>Nubes</hi> we understand (as I have said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
the <hi>Pillar of the Cloud</hi> which was the Israelites
Guide in the Day-time, and by <hi>Coeli lumen</hi> the <hi>Pillar
of Fire</hi> or <hi>Light</hi> which conducted them in the Night.
It is very likely that this latter reading of the
Verse is the truest, and accordingly you have a
plain and obvious Account of what we undertook
to enquire into, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Cloud</hi> which the Jews
were said to worship, and of something more,
namely, the <hi>Light of Heaven</hi> which this Writer
saith they shew'd the same regard to; which is no
other, I conceive, than that <hi>Fiery Pillar</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
appear'd to the Israelites in the Night,
and directed them in their way: and 'tis most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positely

                        <hi>Eusebius,</hi> it might be proved
that the more Solemn Services of Religion among
the Gentiles, and their Cessations from Work,
were on the Seventh Day of the Week. Now,
no wise Man will assert that this Custom was
founded on Nature; for no Light of Reason could
dictate this Division of Days into just seven, and
no more: therefore 'tis reasonable to think that
the general Agreement of the World in this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick,
was derived from the Jews, who were
particularly signalized by their Observation of the
Seventh-Day, which was enjoin'd them by God
himself, as in <hi>Exod. 20. 9. Six Days shalt thou la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
and do all thy Work; but the Seventh Day is the
Sabbath of the Lord thy God: In it thou shalt not do
any Work,</hi> &amp;c. And in other places the Institution
and Observation of this Particular Day are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd.
Or, I might have traced the Original of
this yet higher, and found it dated from the very
Creation, from the beginning of all things, when
we read of <hi>God's resting on the Seventh Day,</hi> Gen. 2. 2.
and his <hi>Blessing the Seventh Day, and Sanctifying it,
v.</hi> 3. From whence, without doubt, the Custom
among several Gentiles of observing some Seventh
Day in the Week, had its first rise.</p>

which contained that Consecrated Element. It
might be proved from good Authors (as you may
see in the Learned Dr. <hi>Spencer</hi>) that they for the
most part sprinkled the Worshippers as they went
into their Temples. The truth is, these Rites of
Washing and Purifying, which were used both by
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are so like one another, that we
cannot but conclude either the Gentiles took them
from the Jews, or these from them. The latter
is in no wise probable, because it is unworthy of
God, and of the Religion which he instituted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Jews, to imagine that he would take
Example from the Pagans, and make their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Standard of that which he gave to his own
People, (though it is true the Jews often imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

may be used in all the Particulars which we

we may prove that those Ceremonious Observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

That the <hi>Greeks</hi> also paid Tithes, appears from

either at home or abroad. Insomuch, that at last

among the Greeks, was as much as <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>consecrare.</hi> Now this Sacred and Religious Rite
of Dedicating just a tenth Part to their Gods, is no
Law of Nature. Though this might put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
offering part of their Increase to those from
whom they thought they received the whole, yet
this particular <hi>Quota</hi> is no Dictate of Nature.
They were not bid by the Law of exact Reason to
consecrate the Tithe of all to the Gods. It is as
reasonable and accountable to give a ninth or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh
Part to them as the Tenth: Therefore
this must proceed from some positive Law and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Institution. And hence I gather that the
Pagans received this Rite and Custom from the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46315:91"/>
                        <hi>Iews,</hi> who were under a Law of Tithes by the
special Command of God, as the Scripture informs
us. And though a late<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Spencer, de Leg. Hebr.</note> Author of great Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
reckons Tithes to have had their Rise from
the Pagan World, yet he cannot but be sensible
that the contrary is universally imbraced by the
Learned. <hi>Selden</hi> particularly proves that the Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians
and Egyptians, and others, who were near
Neighbours to the Jews, received that Custom
from the Jewish Nation; and that afterwards it
was transmitted from those neighbouring Heathens
to others farther off, as the Greeks, Romans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Or, if it could be found that some Heathens before
the Jewish Dispensation offered Tithes, we might
reasonably assert that some of the Patriarchs before
the Law gave occasion to the Heathens to do so.
But this can no where be found; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the antientest Instance of giving Tithes is
that of <hi>Abraham:</hi> we read that after a great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
he devoted the Tithes of all the Spoils to the
Priest of the most High God. From this and the
like Practice, the offering of Tithes among the
Heathens took its beginning.</p>

forbad in Sacrifices, as the Brain and the Heart,

Temple, to be carried from place to place as
need required: For (<hi>as he goes on</hi>) it cannot be
denied that many Superstitions were derived
unto the Heathen from the true Worship of
God which he himself had prescribed unto his
People.</q> But the worthy Author afore-cited is
of another Opinion, telling us, <q>That the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
of <hi>Moloch</hi> was the first Original of tho
Tabernacle of God. God saw that the Pagans
took up on their Shoulders the Tabernacle of
<hi>Moloch,</hi> and thereupon made a Tabernacle for
himself, and an Ark to be born upon Shoulders.</q>
Thus he. And if you would see the Parallel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Moloch</hi>'s <hi>Tabernacles</hi> and <hi>God's Tabernacle,</hi>
take it from that Learned Pen thus:<note n="*" place="bottom">De Legibus Hebraeorum, Lib. 3. cap. 3. Dissertat. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Moloch</hi>'s
Tabernacle was portable; therefore God's was so.
<hi>Moloch</hi>'s Tabernacle contained in it his Image: so
the Tabernacle of Testimony had in it the Ark,
and a pair of Images, <hi>viz.</hi> the Cherubims. In
<hi>Moloch</hi>'s Idolatrous Temple <hi>Moloch</hi> shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
present by his Image, and by giving Answers
thence: Accordingly in the Jewish Tabernacle
the True God inhabited, and exhibited frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a sensible Testimony of his Presence. The Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Tabernacle was called the Tabernacle of
<hi>Moloch,</hi> i. e. <hi>the King:</hi> Semblably the Mosaick Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
was accounted and held to be the Palace
and Mansion of the Highest King, <hi>i. e.</hi> God. The
Tabernacle dedicated to <hi>Moloch,</hi> represented the
Sun placed in its Celestial Tabernacle: In imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this, <hi>Moses</hi>'s Tabernacle was a Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Heavens and the Stars, and the whole
World. Seeing the Learned Author was pleased
to publish this Parallel to the World, I hope it is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46315:93"/>
no Offence to repeat it here, and with submission to
so accomplish'd a Person, to deliver my Thoughts
freely of it. He will not permit it to be said, that
the Devil apes the Almighty: this he discards and
brands as a<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 3. cap. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Vulgar Error.</hi> But I crave leave to
ask this Question, Is not this more tolerable, yea
more credible, than to say that the Cursed Fiend
is imitated by God himself? Can we think that
the True God is so careful and precise in following
the Idolatrous Gentiles? Can we believe that he
so exactly emulated every Point of Idolatry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to <hi>Moloch</hi>'s Tabernacle? Surely this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be thought worthy of that All-wise Being,
this cannot be consistent with what we read of him.
Wherefore let us consult the Place in <hi>Amos; Have
ye offered unto me Sacrifices and Offerings in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
forty Years, O House of</hi> Israel? <hi>But ye have
born the Tabernacle of your</hi> Moloch, <hi>and</hi> Chiun <hi>your
Images, the Star of your God which ye made to your|
selves;</hi> chap. 5. 25, 26. Here God reproves and
upbraids the Israelites for their gross Idolatry, and
particularly for <hi>bearing the Tabernacle of</hi> Moloch.
Whatever Disputes there be about other things in
these Words, this is undeniable, and beyond all
Controversy, that <hi>bearing the Tabernacle of</hi> Moloch
was a piece of Idolatrous Service, it being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
here to <hi>offering Sacrifices and Offerings unto God.</hi>
With this Idolatrous Worship of theirs Gods was
provoked and incensed, and tells them in the next
Verse, <hi>they shall go into Captivity</hi> for this very thing.
Is it then probable that this <hi>bearing of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of Moloch</hi> was the Original of worshipping the
True God in the Tabernacle? Is it reasonable to
believe that he made this manner of Worship his

the Original of this Fire, namely, that

from the Jews: for herein also they imitated them,

<hi>Vestal</hi> Fire was borrowed from Celestial Heat, not
kindled by any Earthly Flame: which shews that
the <hi>Iews</hi> Heavenly Fire, which they kept always
burning, and wherewith they set on fire their <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi>
gave occasion to this of the Heathens. And

If we compare this with what the Jews did

they sat under Booths which they shadowed with
Branches; that they sacrificed to God, holding in
their Hands Boughs of Myrtle and Palm; and that
they went up and down many days with these in
their hands, we may gather hence, that this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Rite was borrowed by the Gentiles, who
were very apish; especially if we take notice that
the Jews and Gentiles kept this sort of Feast at the

However, this is certain that this Jewish
Practice came into use among several Nations, and
it was originally from <hi>Abraham</hi> (who was first cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised)
and his Stock, who were Jews. I might
add here, that the Jews at circumcising the Child
<hi>gave it a Name:</hi> thence the Pagans took up the
same Custom of giving Names to their Infants.
Hence <hi>Dies Nominalis</hi> went along with <hi>Dies Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricus,</hi>
and this was about the <hi>eighth or ninth Day</hi>
among the Romans; which seems also to be in
imitation of the Jews. <hi>Bigamy</hi> was forbidden to
the<note n="*" place="bottom">Liv. Decad. l. 1. 10.</note> Pagan Priests, as it was to the Jewish
ones. So in compliance with the Mosaick Law,
it was unlawful for their<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dio. Hist. lib. 54.</note> Priests to <hi>touch
any dead Corps.</hi> From the same Sacred Fountain
was their <hi>Aqua Lustralis,</hi> used in sprinkling of
Sepulchres, and to purify those who had touched
them, or came near them. From the Law of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,
the Anathema, the Thing or Person devoted to
Death,</hi> Lev. 27. 28, 29. seem to be derived the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and <hi>Devota Capita.</hi> The neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Gentiles heard of the devoting to utter
Destruction certain Cities and their Inhabitants;
and 'tis likely they heard that this was done by the
special Command of God. Hence they apishly and
superstitiously imitated this Usage, (as you have
seen they do in other things) and devoted certain
Men to Death and Destruction, to please and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiate
their Gods. And this is the more credible,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46315:101"/>
because the very word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (which was
sometimes confounded with <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>) was used
by the antient Greeks to signify those miserable
and execrable Wretches who were thus destined
to the Infernal Ghosts. When any great Plague
or Calamity broke in upon the Pagans, Men, as
well as Beasts, were devoted to Slaughter, and
given up as Propitiatory Offerings to their Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
and these, I say, were by them termed <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
Accursed, Devoted, Execrable Creatures,
which answers to the Jewish <hi>Cherems,</hi> which were
Things or Persons devoted to utter Destruction.
This Pagan Usage was but a Transcript of the
Hebrew one.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps <hi>the use of Lots</hi> among the Gentiles had
its Original from what the Sacred Writings relate
of this Practice. In <hi>Lev.</hi> 16. 8. two Goats (in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

was borrowed from the Jews, yet I propose
it as a thing very probable: It is this, that the
<hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were in imitation of
that People; for they were brought up under <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
Types</hi> and <hi>Symbols,</hi> dark Representations,
and mystical Rites: which might give occasion to
the Egyptians to teach Religion and Morality by

Grounds to go on) because I am not <hi>altogether cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
that the Hieroglyphick Learning began after

The famous Law-givers and Politicians among
the Grecians, as <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> had the main
of their Politicks from <hi>Moses</hi>'s Laws, whence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
the Romans took some of theirs. And
as <hi>Moses</hi> received his Laws immediately from
God, so in imitation of him the greatest Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers
said they had theirs from some Deity;

those in the Heavens, say some: Others think the
<hi>Degrees</hi> were <hi>Lines</hi> Engraved on the Dial. So
many <hi>Hours,</hi> or so many <hi>Half-Hours,</hi> or so many
<hi>Quarters</hi> are thought by others to be meant. The
Miracle was here, saith a<note n="c" place="bottom">Grot. in loc.</note> Learned Man, that
the <hi>shadow</hi> on the Dial went back, not that the
<hi>Sun it self did so.</hi> But this is a great mistaking of
the Miracle; for it is expresly said, <hi>Isai. 38. 8.
The Sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was
gone down:</hi> The Sun it self, as well as the shadow,
moved backwards. Again, 'tis undeniable that
this Glorious Luminary of Heaven really went
back, and consequently that a very considerable
duration of time; it may be ten hours were added
to the ordinary day: for the King of <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an Embassadour on purpose to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to enquire
about this Prodigy, and to know what caused so
long a Day, and such a Change of the Course of
Nature, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 20. 12. This argues that those
at <hi>Babylon</hi> saw this unusual Motion of the Sun, for as
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46315:109"/>
to the going back of the <hi>Shadow</hi> on that Dial, they
could not see it. This shews it was a real thing,
and consequently Miraculous, and Portentous,
and that it was not the shadow only on the Dial
that went backward so many Lines or Stroaks,
without the Sun's going back in the Heavens, as
some have fancied. The <hi>Chaldean</hi> Astronomers
could not but hear of, as well as see this Prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sight (for it was as sensible to them, as to the
King of <hi>Babylon)</hi> but out of ill will and malice
they labour'd to suppress this Retrograde motion
of the Sun: whence it is (as<note n="a" place="bottom">Consent of Scripture.</note> Mr. <hi>Broughton</hi>
hath observ'd) that though they reckon up seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Eclipses</hi> which happen'd about this time, yet
they say nothing of this Miraculous going back of
the Sun. Yet (as a<note n="b" place="bottom">Selden de Dis. Syr. Prol. cap. 3.</note> knowing Person hath
observ'd) there is a Mystical Remembrance of the
Shadow on <hi>Ahaz</hi>'s Dial, and the length of that
Day, among the <hi>Persian</hi> Priests, in their Religious
Rites perform'd to <hi>Mithra.</hi> But what those other
Pagans would conceal, their very Poets have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
down to us in a Fable, telling us that the
Sun being angry at <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Birth, <hi>made the
Night unusually long:</hi> For if the Sun make an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary

that there must be a Night of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

Transformation into a Beast, which the Book of

and he adds the like Examples in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

dis-believ'd that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was thus Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stialized,
and remain'd seven years so, as the
Sacred History informs us. Or, if by reason only
of Melancholly he thought himself a Beast (as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians

themselves to be Wolves, others to be Dogs, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Cocks, and have really believ'd they Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,

proper to those species of Animals) this was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
sufficient for the amazed <hi>Pagans</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon, and to make some fanciful matter out
of it. Hence therefore some of the Heathen <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoses</hi>
(which the Poets are frequently talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the <hi>Pythagorean Transmigration, i. e.</hi> the passing
of the Souls of Men into Brutes, had its birth.
Which is the more credible from this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that this Wonderful Transformation of

                        <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Dream <hi>(Dan. 2.)</hi> of an Image
with a <hi>Golden</hi> Head, Breast and Arms of <hi>Silver,
Brazen</hi> Belly, and Legs of <hi>Iron,</hi> which represented
the four Monarchies of the World, was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the <hi>Poetical</hi> Division of Time into four
Ages, which they distinguish according to those
four Metals; first the <hi>Golden-Age,</hi> which began
with the beginning of the World, and lasted to
<hi>Saturn</hi>'s being turn'd out of his Kingdom. This
signisies the happy State of our Fore-Fathers in
Paradise, for <hi>Saturn</hi> is <hi>Adam,</hi> as you shall hear
afterwards. Secondly, there is the <hi>Silver-Age,</hi>
which lasted from <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Exile and being depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
'till <hi>Nimrod,</hi> or <hi>Iupiter Belus,</hi> who is the
same. In this Age all Arts were found out, they
say, and this truly in part is testified by<note n="a" place="bottom">Gen. 4.</note> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Thirdly, they tell us of the <hi>Brazen-Age,</hi>
which began under <hi>Nimrod,</hi> or <hi>Iupiter Belus,</hi> and
lasted to the first year of the return of the <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clidae.</hi>
In this Age Tyranny grew up, and Wars
began, and Slaughter was rife, as the Poets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;
and not untruly, for we find the same in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

them. Now I will shew that they are often repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented

of <hi>Saturn</hi> might be given to <hi>Adam</hi> from <hi>Satar,

shall therefore do her the right to assign the Rank
which I think she held, and the Name which was
given her among the Heathen Goddesses. To
know this, we need only inquire who among them
was the Goddess of Wisdom, and of all the
Arts, and who invented the things which were
most proper for the Female Sex to find out. This
(without any curious search) was <hi>Minerva,</hi> and
no other, and therefore I doubt not but <hi>Eve</hi> was
this <hi>Minerva.</hi> The three great Inventions at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the Goddess of this name, are <hi>Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
and <hi>Weaving,</hi> and the use of <hi>Oyl; i. e.</hi> as I
understand it, the use of it in preparing and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
of Wooll, for 'tis likely that those who
work'd in Wooll of old, made use of Oyl then

of that Goddess; and as for the rest
that the Poets talk of, they are meer fantastick
Flourishes of Poetry, and are not to be minded.</p>
                     <p>Now, considering what I have said, what Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

Artificial Works that were considerable, were
ascribed by the Antients, to this Goddess, but
Spinning and Weaving were more eminently said
to be from her. Our Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> who had the
Wit and Skill to discover these, and to improve
them by her living so long in the World, might
well pass among her own Sex at least, for the
wisest Woman that ever was, and might be enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
the Mistress of all Arts and Sciences, that is,
in the Language of the Poets, <hi>the Goddess of Wisdom.</hi>
Whence I conclude, that our first Parent <hi>Eve,</hi> was
<hi>Minerva,</hi> the First and Original <hi>Spinster,</hi> from
whom her Sex derive that commendable Title.
Only I will add this, That when the Poets tell us,
that <hi>Minerva</hi> was Born of <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Brain, and
without a Mother, they seem to refer to Sacred
History; which acquaints us, that <hi>Eve</hi> was not
Born after the manner of other Women, but
was taken out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s side. He that knows

to this Great Critick, I will say these three things;
First, he goes upon a false supposition, that the

as I have already noted, the Pagans are wont to
change the Terminations of Hebrew words, and
indeed to shape them after their own way, and as
they please. Thirdly, harder Etymologies please

Reign agrees with it, in which Men were strangers
to Pride and Luxury, and lived a mean, but
peaceable and contented Life. Or, take it as it is
Translated, a <hi>Husband-man,</hi> one that looked after
the Cultivating of the Earth, and so it fits both
<hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> or rather shews these to be one
and the same Person, who was employ'd about
the <hi>Earth,</hi> and the <hi>Fruits of it,</hi> whereof the <hi>Vine</hi>
was one of the chiefest. <hi>Saturn</hi> devoured his
Children, <hi>i. e.</hi> saith this Author, <hi>Noah</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="bottom">Heb. 11. 7.</note>

he himself escaped. Or, it may be apply'd to
his shutting up his Children in the <hi>Ark,</hi> among
the Beasts, as if he intended they should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd

Sons again, in like manner <hi>Noah</hi> restored his

<hi>Saturn</hi> was driven out of his Kingdom
by his Son, after he had first cut off his Father's Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitals:
which refers to Cursed <hi>Cham, Noah</hi>'s Son,

<hi>Ham</hi> (whom they call'd <hi>Iupiter)</hi> made an Eunuch
of his Father. And truly, that <hi>Iupiter Hammon</hi>
was the same <hi>Ham, Noah</hi>'s Son, may be gather'd
from the place where <hi>Ham</hi> and his posterity
were Seated, namely in <hi>Africa.</hi> Here, in the
Desarts of <hi>Lybia,</hi> was the Famous Oracle of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter
Hammon,</hi> who had his Name from that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46315:115"/>
Wicked Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> who in this place vented
his Blasphemies (which pass'd for <hi>Oracles</hi> with
some,) and thereby debauched the Minds of the
generality of that Age; and in process of time
he came to be Worshipped there under the Name
of <hi>Iupiter Ham,</hi> or <hi>Hammon.</hi> I know some have
thought <hi>Hamon</hi> is <hi>Chamah Sol,</hi> because he is
reckon'd the same with the <hi>Sun:</hi> And others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
it from <hi>Hamon Multitudo</hi> (as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s

and <hi>Hamon,</hi> a Multitude, whence he is called a
<hi>Father of many Nations, Gen.</hi> 17. 5. So that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
is but an abbreviature of <hi>Abrahammon.)</hi> But
there is great reason to think that this <hi>Hammon</hi>

main Argument to prove <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> to be
the same is yet behind, which is this; that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi>
by the Heathens is said to have had three
Sons, <hi>Iupiter, Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Pluto,</hi> and that he
divided the World among them. This Fable
of dividing the World among three Brethren,
the Children of <hi>Saturn,</hi> did plainly arise from
the dividing the Earth between the three Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
the Sons of <hi>Noah. Of these three was the
whole Earth overspread,</hi> Gen. 9. 19. <hi>By these were
the Nations divided in the Earth after the Flood,</hi>
Gen. 10. 32. The Hot Country of <hi>Africa</hi> was
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46315:116"/>
                        <hi>Cham</hi>'s division, who might have his Name given
him from a foresight of the place where he and
his Race were to Inhabit, the Land of <hi>Cham,</hi>
from <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>Caluit:</hi> this is no unlikely derivation.
Again, <hi>Iaphet</hi> (another of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons) was <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>
as <hi>Bochart</hi> indeavours to shew, for the <hi>Isles</hi>
and <hi>Peninsulae</hi> fell to his share, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 5. And
<hi>Vossius</hi> is very positive in this, that the Antientest
<hi>Neptune</hi> (for there were <hi>Neptunes</hi> as well as <hi>Ioves</hi>
many) was this <hi>Iaphet,</hi> to his Lot fell <hi>Europe,</hi> for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <hi>Iapeti genus.
Shem</hi> was <hi>Pluto,</hi> and what may be said for it, you
may see in the fore-named Writer. From the
whole there is some reason to believe that <hi>Noah,</hi>
the Father of those three Sons, among whom the
World was divided, was one Person at least that
was represented by the Heathen God <hi>Saturn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next place, it is not difficult to prove
that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> God <hi>Apis,</hi> or <hi>Serapis,</hi> was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the Renowned Ruler in <hi>Egypt</hi>
under King <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> This Person had abundantly
merited of all <hi>Egypt,</hi> and infinitely obliged the
whole Country, by laying up Corn in store, and
thereby providing for them against the time of
Scarcity and Famine. For this singular Benefit to
them, they erected an <hi>Ox</hi> or <hi>Cow</hi> to preserve his
Memory, for in that Figure <hi>Apis</hi> or <hi>Serapis</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd,
and was Worshipp'd by the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
And under what Symbol more fitly than that of
an <hi>Ox</hi> could <hi>Ioseph</hi> be represented? For not to
mention the Fame he got by his Wonderful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Dream of the <hi>Fat and Lean
Kine,</hi> whence perhaps that sort of Animals was
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46315:116"/>
afterwards in great reverence and esteem on this
account, as carrying with them some thing Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and Hieroglyphical, which made them the
more acceptable to this People, who were then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to hearken to such things. Not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this, I say, <hi>Ioseph</hi> might most appositely be
signified by that Animal which is made use of in
Ploughing, in order to the <hi>Sowing and coming up
of the Corn,</hi> that Creature which is serviceable to
the <hi>treading out the Corn</hi> (for that was another
great employment of the <hi>Ox</hi> in those days.)
Therefore the Holy Spirit in Scripture seems to
refer to this in <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 6. which Text (speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Brethrens wicked Design to kill
him) calls him an<note n="a" place="bottom">

among Prophane Writers also they are thus na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
sometimes: for a <hi>Bull</hi> or <hi>Ox</hi> is a Symbol of

On this account the Famous Patriarch <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46315:117"/>
was Constituted by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> the Chief Ruler and
Prince of <hi>Egypt,</hi> hath this Name given him. But
there is something more particular intended here
in this Title, for it hath respect to <hi>Ioseph</hi> as he
was Grand Proveditor of that Country: for there
could not be a better Symbol of Provision of
Corn and Bread than this Creature. Hence is that
of <hi>Solomon,</hi>

<hi>Egyptian Serapis</hi> then in the form of a <hi>Cow</hi> or <hi>Ox,</hi>
was a true Hieroglyphick of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> especially
when we add, that a <hi>Bushel</hi> was plac'd on its
head, as saith<note n="b" place="bottom">Hist. Eccles. l. 2. c. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> to signifie that <hi>Ioseph</hi>
was the giver out of Corn, that he caus'd it to
be <hi>measur'd</hi> and proportioned according to the
needs of those to whom he dispens'd it. By this
Wise as well as Liberal Act his Fame grew great
among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and other adjoyning Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and at length they Worshipp'd him as a
God by the Symbol of an <hi>Ox,</hi> which they stiled
<hi>Serapis,</hi> as not only <hi>Ruffinus, Augustin, Suidas,
Iulius Firmicus</hi> of old, but <hi>Vossius, Bonfrerius,
Pierius,</hi> and <hi>Kircher</hi> of late have maintain'd. And
I am enclin'd to think that the word <hi>Serapis</hi> was
Originally <hi>Sorapis,</hi> a Compound of <hi>Sor</hi> an <hi>Ox,</hi> and
<hi>Apis</hi> an <hi>Egyptian</hi> word perhaps of the same sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification.
And this is the more credible, because
the word <hi>Apis</hi> alone is sometimes used for <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis.</hi>
Some have thought that <hi>Mercury</hi> was a Name
given by the <hi>Pagans</hi> to this <hi>Ioseph,</hi> he being <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi>
                        <pb n="217" facs="tcp:46315:117"/>
an <hi>Interpreter,</hi> for it is particularly recorded
that <hi>he Interpreted Dreams, Gen. 41. &amp;</hi> 42, and
was a <hi>Diviner, Gen.</hi> 44. 5. whence he was called
<hi>Zaphnath Paaneah, i. e.</hi> a Revealer or Interpreter
of Secrets, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 45. But I rather think these
words are better rendred by St. <hi>Ierom</hi> (who tells
us he learnt the meaning of them from some that
well understood the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tongue) <hi>Salvator
Mundi,</hi> and so they refer to <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s timely Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that part of the World from perishing by
Famine. In this sense he was a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and he
was for this made a <hi>God.</hi> Thus the Ancient <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi>

<hi>Vossius</hi> saith. This <hi>Moses</hi> was so eminent and
signal a Person, and his Actions so well known to
the Pagan World, that Monsieur <hi>Huet</hi> thinks and
indeavours to prove that he was represented not
only by <hi>Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> but by <hi>Apollo,
Aesculapius, Pan, Priapus, Prometheus, Ianus,</hi> and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46315:118"/>
by those Egyptian Deities especially, <hi>Osiris, Apis,
Serapis, Orus, Anubis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Neighbouring People of <hi>Phoenicia</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi>
could not but hear of <hi>Iosuah</hi> and his Acts, and
thence made their <hi>Hercules</hi> out of him; and from
them he was sent down to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who you
may be sure would augment the Stories which they
heard. I say <hi>Iosua</hi> was the Pagans <hi>Hercules,</hi> for
he fought with <hi>Giants,</hi> whose great Stature at first
frighted the <hi>Israelites.</hi> In the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
which he Conquer'd, were the <hi>Sons of Anak,</hi> Men
of a vast size, <hi>Numb. 13. 33, 34. Bashan</hi> more
signally is call'd <hi>the Land of Giants, Deut.</hi> 3. 13.
Whilst <hi>Iosua</hi> was fighting with these <hi>Canaanitish</hi>
Giants<note n="a" place="bottom">Jos. 10. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>the Lord cast down great Stones from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon them:</hi> The remembrance of which (saith
<hi>Vossius)</hi> is kept among the Gentiles, and applied
to <hi>Iove</hi> assisting <hi>Hercules</hi> in the very same sort
when he grapled with Giants, and was put hard
to it.</p>

                        <hi>Samson</hi> as well as <hi>Iosua</hi> was the Greeks <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi>
and from the one the History or rather
Fable of the other is taken. First, as <hi>Vossius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
the times of both agree: <hi>Hercules,</hi> and
<hi>Samson</hi> were Contemporary, as appears from
comparing the Greek and Jewish accounts of time.
When these hit together, there is a presumption
at least. Again, <hi>Hercules</hi> slew the <hi>Nemaean Lion,</hi>
which answers to what we read of <hi>Samson,</hi>
Judg. 14. 5, 6. <hi>A young Lion roared against him,

<hi>viz.</hi> That it had four Vowels, and consisted of
four Vowels alone: This seems to have been <hi>Iova,</hi>

<hi>Ioua.</hi> We may then reasonably believe that the

to their <hi>Idol-Gods.</hi> The Pagans call their
Deities by Titles which are given to the True
God <hi>Iehovah.</hi> This makes good what I aim'd at,
that the Heathens had these as well as other things
from the <hi>Sacred Scriptures:</hi> and it is certain they
could have them from these only; which is a
proof of the verity and antiquity of those Holy

was derived from the same inspired Writings
I grant that it partly proceeded from their sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish

instead of a God, Ex. 4. 16. i. e.</hi> according to the
Chaldee and Arabick, a <hi>Iudge</hi> or <hi>Prince.</hi> God
himself honours the Rulers of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> with
the Title of <hi>Gods, Ps. 82. 6. I have said ye are
Gods.</hi> So in <hi>Psalm 138. Gods</hi> in the 1st <hi>verse</hi> are
<hi>Kings of the Earth</hi> in the 4th. It might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
that <hi>Elohim</hi> and <hi>Adonai,</hi> the usual Names
of God himself, are attributed to <hi>Great Men</hi> in
the Sacred Writings. In short, as <hi>God</hi> is often
called <hi>King</hi> in Scripture, so <hi>Kings</hi> are called <hi>Gods,</hi>
and thence the expression is convey'd to the
Pagans, and frequently used by them. Among

(for these words are indifferently used) signifie
both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>King.</hi> And perhaps it was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
or relation to this Notion, that they
commonly inserted the Names of their Gods
into those of their Princes, though it might be
also as a good Omen, or for Honour's sake. From
their Gods, I say, Princes compound their Names,

If God liveth.</hi> Our Learned <hi>Farnaby</hi> likes this
Criticism very well, and hath inserted it into
his Notes on this place. But by the leave of so
Great a Critick, there is I conceive something
faulty in it: For though I am most willing to
grant, that there is in this place a reference to
the Form of Swearing which was used by the
<hi>Iews</hi> in the Old Testament; yet I am not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to assent to this interpretation of the
word <hi>Anchialum,</hi> which this Noble Philologist pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
us with, and that for these Reasons; first it is
not <hi>Am</hi> but <hi>An</hi> that must answer to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the word <hi>Anchialum.</hi> However, this may
be born with, being an easie change of a Letter.
Secondly, there is no such Hebrew Word as <hi>am.</hi>
There is <hi>im si,</hi> but then it should be <hi>Imchialum,</hi>
not <hi>Anchialum.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Ala</hi> is not an usual
word for <hi>God</hi> among the <hi>Iews,</hi> because it is an
Arabick, not an Hebrew word, and 'twas never
made use of in that Nation, and 'tis not once

<hi>vivit</hi> (and without the Vowel under it <hi>Chi,</hi> and
perhaps they might vulgarly pronounce it so) and
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

an Oath of a <hi>Iew</hi> who denies the Crime which he
is accus'd of, he Swears thus, <hi>An chi alon,</hi> i. e.
<hi>Non: vivit deus.</hi> But I cannot on due Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
think that this is a true account of this
Passage; for first <hi>Alon</hi> was not a Name in use
(nay perhaps not known) among the <hi>Iews.</hi> This
Author indeed saith it may be gathered out of
<hi>Plautus,</hi> that God's Name was pronounced <hi>Alon,</hi>
but we are not to consider what pronunciation
the Name had among other People, <hi>i. e.</hi> Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but what was in constant use among the
<hi>Iewish</hi> People: for the Poet refers here to that.
Wherefore there being no such Name among
them, it could not be used by them in an Oath
and consequently it is not here meant, when <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
is jesting with the Circumcised Poet. And
as for the word <hi>Eljon,</hi> which 'tis true is often used
in Scripture, and of which this <hi>Alon</hi> seems to be
a corruption, it is an Epithet rather than a Name
of God, and therefore was not (it is likely) put
into a Formal Oath. Again, the word <hi>an,</hi> which
this Author makes one of the ingredients of
this word which the Poet useth, hath no such
lignification as he pretends it hath. Indeed <hi>ajin,</hi>
and the contraction of it <hi>in</hi> is <hi>non,</hi> but <hi>an</hi> hath
no other signification but <hi>ubi,</hi> or <hi>quorsum,</hi> or <hi>quous</hi>

                        </gap>
(which is of the same Original) the Name <hi>Deus</hi>
comes, for 'tis probable that heretofore it was
pronounced as one Syllable, and so was as much as
<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore even <hi>Deus</hi> 15 the <hi>Living God.</hi>
But to proceed, God's <hi>Life</hi> is himself, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis no wonder that God's People the <hi>Iews</hi>
Swore by it. <hi>Chi Elohim</hi> was the constant form
of words which they used, and it was taken (as you
have heard) out of the Holy Scriptures. So then
<hi>An chi elohim</hi> is no other than <hi>Verily, truly the Lord
liveth:</hi> the word <hi>an</hi> being presix'd by the <hi>Iews</hi> to
express their affection and concern about the thing
which they asserted or denied with a Solemn Oath.
Now, when the <hi>Iews</hi> pronounced this Oath in
these words, those that were ignorant of the
Tongue, thought it was all but one word or Name.
Our Witty Poet who was not skill'd in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
was guilty of the same mistake, and put the
<hi>Iew</hi> upon Swearing by <hi>Anchialum,</hi> which was a
misunderstanding of <hi>An chi Elohim:</hi> which words
when they were pronounced fast and indistinctly,
seem'd unto those who were not skill'd in the
Hebrew Tongue to sound like <hi>Anchialum.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Martial</hi> saith, <hi>Iura, verpe, per Anchialum,
i. e. per an chi Eloim,</hi> or with an usual Synalaepha,
<hi>An ch' Eloim,</hi> which likewise is an instance of
what I asserted before, that Transpositions, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviatures,
and Corruptions of words are very
usual, and that their right Terminations are laid
aside very often. Or, perhaps the Name <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>El</hi>
(which is also the usual Name of God in the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46315:130"/>
Old Testament,) is here intended: For that also
was used in <hi>Oaths,</hi> as appears from <hi>Iob 27. 2.
Chai El. As God liveth.</hi> And without doubt it
was used by the <hi>Iews,</hi> as well as <hi>Eloah</hi> and <hi>Elohim,</hi>
in Swearing: yea, some Hebritians have thought
that these words are derived from the Verb <hi>Alah
juravit,</hi> because they are used in Swearing. <unclear>An</unclear>
chi El, <hi>Verily God liveth,</hi> was a common form of
an Oath, no less than <hi>An chi Elohim,</hi> and thence
the ignorant Hearers among the Pagans thought
that the Name of the <hi>Iews</hi> God was <hi>Anchiel,</hi> or
<hi>Anchial:</hi> And <hi>Martial</hi> here having occasion to
use it in the Accusative Case, adds the usual ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
to it, and makes it <hi>Anchialum.</hi> Swear
to me, saith he to his Brother Poet, who was a
<hi>Iew,</hi> by a Jewish Oath, Swear by the most So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
and Sacred Oath that you have in use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you, and that is, (as I have heard) <hi>Anchial</hi>
or <hi>Anchiel,</hi> which is no other then <hi>An chi El,
Verily God liveth.</hi> With great deference and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the judgments of the foresaid Learned
Criticks, I propound either of these to be the

                        </gap>airest and easiest solution of that controverted
place of <hi>Martial.</hi> It is not <hi>Chi Alah,</hi> nor <hi>Chi
Alon,</hi> nor <hi>Chi gnolam,</hi> but <hi>Chi Elohim,</hi> or <hi>Chi El</hi>
(take which you please) that is referr'd to here
by the Poet: for these are <hi>the very words</hi> used in
Scripture, and we read that one of them espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
is the express form of Swearing among
the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Which is the thing I alledged this
passage for, <hi>viz.</hi> To let you see how Pagan Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have frequent references to the Book of
God, and particularly the <hi>Name</hi> of the True
God, and to the Customs and Usages there spoken

                        <pb n="243" facs="tcp:46315:130"/>I would offer to the Learned another Notion
in prosecution of the Subject I have been so
long upon. I am of the Opinion that from <hi>The
frequent mention of Horns in the Old Testament,</hi>
the Heathens borrow'd the like expression, and
apply'd it in that very sense in which 'tis used in
those Holy Writings. The Hebrew <hi>Keren</hi> (whence
the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

as also <hi>Ioy, Safety, Prosperity;</hi> whence you
read of <hi>the Horn of Salvation, 2 Sam.</hi> 22. 3.
Psal. 18. 2. and <hi>the exalting, lifting up, and setting
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> the Horn,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 1. Ps. 75. 4, 10. Ps. 89. 17.
Ps. 112. 9. Lam. 2. 17. Zach. 1. 21. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<hi>cutting off the Horn,</hi> signifies debasing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading,
a mournful, unsafe, afflicted Condition,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> is clear from <hi>Ps. 75, 10. Ier. 48. 25. Lam.</hi> 2. 3.
And <hi>defiling the Horn,</hi> is of the same import,
<hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> 16. 5. From the signification of the Verb
<hi>Kuran,</hi> we may be partly confirmed in this sense
of the Noun <hi>Keren,</hi> for 'tis said of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Face
that <hi>it shone, Ex.</hi> 34. 29. it was very Bright and
Glorious. The vulgar Latin renders it, <hi>it was
Horn'd,</hi> and thence (was said before) <hi>Moses</hi> is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sually Pictured with Horns. But we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rstand
it spoken Metaphorically, <hi>viz.</hi> of those
<hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ays</hi> or <hi>Beams of Light</hi> which darted from his
face, and which were as 'twere Horns of Light.
So in <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 4. by <hi>Horns</hi> is meant <hi>Brightness</hi> or
<hi>Light,</hi> and it is so expresly interpreted in that
rerse. The Radiency, the Splendour of <hi>Moses</hi>'s
Face was very great, and is rightly called by the
Apostle, <hi>the Glory of his Countenance, 2 Cor.</hi> 3. 7.
So that hence we may gather that the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<hi>Outward Glory.</hi> And as this word <hi>Keren</hi>
signifies more generally Power, Grandeur, Our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46315:131"/>
Glory, and Prosperity, so it more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
denotes Kingly Power, Soveraign Dominiou
and Empire, the Greatness and Splendor of
Crowned Heads. (Whence, by the way, I propound
it as probable, that from the Eastern words <hi>Karan</hi>
and <hi>Keren</hi> are derived the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Dominus,
Imperator,</hi> and the Latin <hi>Corona.</hi>) Thus <hi>Horn</hi> is
applied in 1 <hi>Sam. 2. 10. He shall give strength unto
his King, and exalt the Horn of his Annointed.</hi>
And in the <hi>Psalms</hi> you will find that this word
hath particular reference to <hi>David</hi> as <hi>King,
Ps.</hi> 89. 24. 91. 10. So in <hi>Ps.</hi> 132. 17. 'tis spoken
of him as the <hi>Lord's Annointed,</hi> and 'tis joyn'd with
a <hi>Crown</hi> in the next verse. In the Book of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
this Language is very common, in the <hi>7th</hi> and
<hi>8th</hi> Chapters a <hi>Horn</hi> and <hi>Horns</hi> signifie Princely
Dominion, and the Persons that exercis'd it: and
in the latter of these Chapters those two <hi>Horn'd</hi>
Beasts, a <hi>Ram,</hi> and a <hi>Goat,</hi> are Representatives of
<hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> It is in express words said
in two places, <hi>Horns are Kings, Dan.</hi> 7. 24. 8. 7.
Now, from this particular stile and idiom of the
Ancient Holy Book of the Scriptures, the Heathen
Writers learnt to speak after the same manner.
Not only in a general way was the word <hi>Horn</hi>
used by some of their Authors, to<note n="a" place="bottom">Tunc pauper cornua sumit. <hi>Horat.</hi>

                        <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niger</hi>
was the Epithet of <hi>Iupiter Hammon,</hi> and we
may inform our selves from several Writers
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46315:131"/>
that he was commonly pictured with Horns:
which had its rise, I conceive, from the like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of <hi>Great Ones</hi> in the Old Testament,
as you have heard. I know other Reasons are
alledg'd, as that of <hi>Servius,</hi> who thinks this <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
had that Title, and was represented <hi>Horned,</hi>
because of his Winding Oracles, because his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
had as many crooked Turnings as a Ram's
Horn. <hi>Macrobius,</hi> and some others tell us, that
this <hi>Hammon,</hi> was no other than the <hi>Sun,</hi> whose
Beams are Cornute, whose Rays are in the fashion
of <hi>Horns.</hi> If the <hi>Moon</hi> had been meant, then I
confess, the Epithet of <hi>Horned</hi> had been very
Natural: But I don't think, that the Metaphorical
<hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> (which are its Rays) were thought
of here by the Antients. Wherefore, I look upon
these as mean and trifling Reasons. But the true
occasion, if I mistake not, of their describing
<hi>Iupiter Hammon</hi> with <hi>Horns,</hi> and of representing
other Gods, as <hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> after the same
manner, was this, that they complied with the
Stile of the Sacred Writings, (as was an usual
thing with them) which set forth Great Power,
Magnificence and Glory, especially <hi>Kingly</hi> Power
and Greatness, by the expression of <hi>Horns.</hi> This
suited well with their <hi>Gods,</hi> who were Great Folks,
and generally <hi>Deified Kings.</hi> We read, that a <hi>Ram</hi>
and a <hi>Goat</hi> are Symbols of Regal Strength, in the
Prophetick Writings; in imitation of which, it is
probable, <hi>Iupiter Hammon</hi> was worshipp'd in
<hi>Afsrick,</hi> in the shape of an Image which had partly
the proportions of a <hi>Ram,</hi> and partly of a <hi>Goat.</hi>
And from the same Original, <hi>(viz.</hi> the Holy
Scriptures) it was, that Antiently the <hi>Pagan</hi> Kings
and Monarchs were represented and stiled <hi>Horned,</hi>
as we may satisfie our selves from several Authors.

Men. Their Priests took their Religious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
yea their very Gods: their Poets took
their Fables; their Historians, their more serious

Opinions; their Common People, their Words

Writings of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and the Doctrine,
Rites, and Practices of the <hi>Iews</hi> therein Recorded.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46315:135"/>
very bold and presuming in his Etymologies, he
making it his business to fetch all from the <hi>Phaeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Tongue; which to accomplish, he makes any
thing out of any thing. I have not ventured to
Etymologize after the rate of these Men (though
they are all of them very Learned Heads), but I
have with singular care, throughout my whole un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
endeavour'd to preserve the Honour of
Grammar and Criticism, which so many have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated;
and not to put off the Reader with far
fetch'd Derivations of Words and Names, without
observing the due Laws of deducing and forming
them. I have never presumed to derive one word
from another, where there was not a fair Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
Analogy between them, and some agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in their sound, and some considerable proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of their being nearly allied to one another.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, if any <hi>Object,</hi> that I have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
many things from the mere sound and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of words, which is an uncertain and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thing, and there is no conclusion to be made
thence; I <hi>Answer,</hi> it is true, the sole Affinity of
words is no firm and undeniable Argument of their
Origination. The significations of words in
different Languages, may sometimes be coincident,
yet we are not certain thence of their Deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
This I am most ready to grant; nay
farther, that it is folly to derive one word from
another, meerly because of the likeness of them;
as if, because the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> is divided into <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shah's,</hi>
therefore we must derive <hi>Parishes</hi> from
thence, they being such a part of a City or Town
set out, as divided and separated from the rest:
You may as well derive <hi>Montgomery</hi> from <hi>Gomer,</hi>
and say it is the <hi>Montanous</hi> Country where <hi>Gomer</hi>
Lived. Who thinks, that the <hi>English</hi> word <hi>Evil,</hi>
                        <pb n="254" facs="tcp:46315:136"/>
comes from the <hi>Hebrew, Evil,</hi> a Fool? It would
be ridiculously quibbling, to fetch the Proverbial
Saying, <hi>As lean as a Rake,</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew, Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

tenuis, macer, gracilis fuit;</hi> or to make <hi>a bad one</hi>
in <hi>English,</hi> to have assinity with <hi>Abaddon.</hi> It would
be yet more intolerably ridiculous, and might be
look'd upon as a School-Boy's pun, to derive a
<hi>High-Man,</hi> from one of the three Giants call'd
<hi>Ahiman.</hi> Wherefore, I do not contend, that all
accidental likenesses in words, are a foundation to
ground Etymologies and Derivations upon. I
know some are very foolish and trifling here; they
find such and such words in different Tongues,
agreeing in sound, and thence they infer they are
akin, if they can but make out any kind of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
in their signification. If the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word
<hi>bad,</hi> (which hath many significations) had one like
the <hi>English (bad),</hi> they would presently say, that
this came from that. If <hi>Siccus</hi> had been of the
same signification with <hi>Aegrotus,</hi> we should have
said the <hi>English</hi> word <hi>Sick</hi> was thence. If <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> had been as much as <hi>imperare, gubernare,</hi> some would conclude <hi>regnum</hi> to be derived from it. And*
several other words I could instance in, which you
shall find in another place. I grant then, that there
is a great deal of uncertainty in <hi>Etymologies,</hi> and we
are not to lay any huge stress upon them. But though
this be true, yet where we find there is agreat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
that words are related to one another,
where there is good ground for it, we are to take
notice of it. Though there be in <hi>Goropius B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And many other words there are whose derivation
is plain and easie, and therefore is most readily
acknowledged. There is reason then why we
should enquire into the Original of words, and
track them to their fountain head. And this is
that which I have done in the fore-going Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize:
where there was a great likelyhood that
the Greek or Latin were derived from the
Hebrew, I took notice of it, and improved it to
my purpose. I have not offer'd any thing that
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46315:137"/>
is strain'd and forc'd: The Derivation of those
words which I had occasion to look into in this
Discourse is very plain and obvious, and such as
any unprejudic'd Man will not boggle at, as

They are Natural, plain, and easie, and the

other things occurred to me of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

<hi>Noach,</hi> though I am not very earnest in pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the affinity between them, yet those who
consider what a number of words is changed
and corrupted by time, will not wonder that
some Learned Writers have thought those words
to be the same Originally. There are many
Greek and Latin words which might be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
wherein one or more Letters are put for
others, and such alterations are made, that the
words have lost their native sound, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be quite other words. I could render this
the more credible, by instancing in many
words in our own and other Modern Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which are corrupted in common Discourse,
and are much unlike the words from whence
they are derived: And yet we readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:46315:138"/>
that they are Corruptions of such and
such words. And if there be these alterations
in the same Tongue, you may imagine how
much more it is in the transferring of words
into other Tongues: You may conceive what a
change of Letters and Syllables, what Transpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
or Contractions, besides the altering of
the Terminations, there must be to make an
Oriental word become an <hi>European</hi> one.</p>

therefore none were taken thence? Because some

Man himself? Thus the World may be thought
to be a Great Egg. But I rather think it was
from the Oval or Round Figure of the World
that they represented it by an Egg: and you
must know it was believ'd that this sort of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
had some perfection in it, and so on that
account they took the more notice of it, and
this Spherical shape of the Universe was much
admired and Celebrated by them: yea, it was
thought to be Sacred and Divine: so that by this

which <hi>Samson</hi> took hold of and pull'd down, it
might justly have been objected, that I stretch'd
the Parallel too far; and yet I must tell
you, that there are no contemptible Authors,
(among whom <hi>Vossius</hi> is one) who have
made one, a Reference to the other. I have
purposely avoided such far-fetch'd Conceits,
and have all along declin'd the suggestions of
those Writers, who have let their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
run too high. This I consider'd, that among
the Poets especially, there are many things which
are the pure product of their Luxuriant Fancy,
and have no ground at all in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
It is their way (as I have said before) to
insert their own whimsies, to lard True Story
with their own wild Conceits and Capricio's,
which we must never mind; for they are only
Poetick Flourishes, and therefore must not be
thought to refer to any real thing. The fixing
this on my mind, kept me from running into
those Extravagancies, which some have been
guilty of, whilst they imagined, that the Poets
in all or most of the particulars, with which their
Fables are stuffed, allude to so many express
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46315:142"/>
passages in True History. I attended to the main
thing in their Writings, which I saw came so
near to Scripture; the rest I pass'd by, as meer
Poetick Flash and Foolery, and not to be taken
notice of. In short, I have always trod where
there is some tolerable ground and footing; and
I have omitted several particulars which others
insist upon, meerly because they have so sandy a
bottom. So little Reason have any to blame me
for indulging of Fancy, in this present under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
where I have endeavour'd in abundant
instances to make it probable, that the <hi>Pagans</hi>
borrowed from the Sacred Writings.</p>

the Books of the Pagans.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>BUT not withstanding all I have said, there
are some who will by no means entertain
this Discourse, but with great earnestness and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46315:143"/>
violence oppose it. I am obliged therefore in
the next place, to fortifie it by Reason. I will
discover to you the Foundations on which my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
is built, and give you a Rational Account,
how it comes to pass, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> bear
witness to the Old Testament. This I will do,
first, by shewing you how they came by these
Traditions and Truths: Secondly, whence, and
how they disguis'd and corrupted them.</p>
                     <p>For the First, It is not likely the <hi>Gentiles</hi> could
light on these things by Natural Reason, for
those discoveries concerning the Creation, and
the Paradisiacal State of Man, and the particular
mann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r of his Fall, and several other things which
I mention'd, are beyond Nature's Ken, they are
not such things as fall within the cognizance of
Men, as they are Rational Creatures; therefore
they must be particularly Revealed to Mankind:
And the Authentick Body of Divine Revealed
Truth being the Bible, we cannot but infer, that
those things were borrowed from that Sacred
Volume. And as for Matters of Fact, relating
to the Old Patriarchs, and other Eminent Men
in former days, on which I have asserted, that
many of the <hi>Pagan</hi> Stories and Fables depend,
these were Recorded in those Sacred Books first
of all, and therefore these Books are the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
from which the Heathens took these Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
This Argument, I take to be unanswerable,
namely, that the Old Testament is the First and
Antientest Book that ever was extant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when the <hi>Pagan</hi> Writers mention things in
this Book, they took them thence, or from those
Persons who had them out of these Writings.
Here then it is necessary, to insist a little on the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:46315:144"/>
                        <hi>Antiquity</hi> of this Holy Volume. That <hi>Moses's</hi>

He shews that <hi>Thales,</hi> and <hi>Solon,</hi> two of their

that <hi>Solomon</hi> was much Seniour to the Wise

the <hi>Greeks,</hi> (as well as the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians)</hi>
had their Knowledge from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
and not these from them. Seeing then that the
Ancientest Pagan Writers are short of the
Holy Scriptures, seeing all Authors and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are after <hi>Moses</hi> (for he indeed was before
all the Great things that are in Pagan History, 400
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46315:146"/>
years before the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, which is the first

His Laws had the precedency of all others
whatsoever, yea, the very name of <hi>Law</hi> was

can't find the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> they had no writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Rules to direct their Manners by, the will
of their Princes was the only Law,) since these
things are thus, the Transcendant Antiquity of
the Writings of the Old Testament is hence
undeniably proved. These are the ancientest
Memorials in the World, these are the oldest
Monuments of Truth, and consequently the
<hi>Iews</hi> were the first People that had these things
set before them, and, as a consequent of that,
all others took from them. From this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the Antiquity of Writers, it is clear
that <hi>Moses</hi>'s Laws and the Customs of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
were not borrowed from the Pagans
(as some have imagin'd,) but that the <hi>Chaldeans,
Phaenicians,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> yea, that the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi>
and <hi>Persians</hi> (as might have been shewn,
and as the Learned Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> now a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Prelate of our Church, hath proved in
his Admirable Discourse on this Subject) and
that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and Latins have derived their
Mysteries from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and that all the
Gentile Theologers borrowed their Great
Truths from the Books of the Old Testament:
for these being the ancientest and first Records,
it is most reasonable to believe that those that
came after them took from them, and that
these Sacred Writings yielded matter to those
others. This is the first Reason to prove that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:46315:146"/>
the Pagan Historians, Philosophers, and Poets
were beholding to the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I will prove it from the <hi>way of
Communicating</hi> those Scriptural Truths and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
to them. 1. This happen'd by reason
of the Commerce which the <hi>Iews</hi> had with the
Neighbouring Nations, <hi>Chaldeans, Phaenicians,
Egyptians,</hi> and others. Especially in King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s
time there was a great Commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and these latter: and then
it is probable the <hi>Egyptians</hi> learnt many things
of the <hi>Iews.</hi> As <hi>Solomon</hi> Married a Wife
thence, so it is likely they affected some of the
Rites and Manners of his People, and espoused
their Customs and Usages, together with their
Notions and Opinions. It must be remembred
also, that the <hi>Chaldeans, Phaenicians,</hi> and <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
were the Nations which <hi>Greece</hi> Traded
with, and so this Country had an opportunity
of receiving the <hi>Iewish</hi> Traditions and Customs
at the second hand: and hence it is that you
have the footsteps of them so frequently in the
Greek Authors, as well Poets as others. Nay,
to speak more generally, <hi>Iudea</hi> was very well
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ituated for the propagating of Laws and Usa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
to all other Nations, for it was placed in
that Climate of the World which was fit for this
purpose, viz. in the middle of the then Inhabited
Earth: To which convenient situation perhaps
the Psalmist refers, in <hi>Psal. 74. 12. God worketh
Salvation in the midst of the Earth.</hi> And so
that of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> concerning <hi>Ierusalem, I have set
it in the midst of the Nations,</hi> Ch. 5. v. 5.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="276" facs="tcp:46315:147"/>Secondly, A great part of the Hebrews being
dispersed over all the World by Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had an opportunity of Communicating
these things to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The main Body of
them were sent into <hi>Assyria,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> by
<hi>Nehuchadnezzar,</hi> where they had converse with
those S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rangers seventy years: and a part of
them were carried at the same time into <hi>Egypt</hi>
with <hi>Ieremiah.</hi> It is not to be doubted that
they carried with them the Holy Writings
which were then extant, and out of them they
daily imparted the passages of the History of
the <hi>Creation of the World,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, and
<hi>the Propagation of Mankind,</hi> and other the like
particulars contained in those Books. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
when they were beaten by <hi>Pompey,</hi> and
made Slaves, they were carried Captive into
<hi>Egypt, Syria, Greece, Rome.</hi> Besides that, in
the times of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> some had freely
left their Country, and went into <hi>Egypt</hi> to
make Proselytes there. When they were thus
scattered into these Foreign Countries, it is no
wonder that the People in these parts attain'd
to some knowledge of the Sacred Books, and
of the Traditions of the <hi>Iews.</hi> They must
needs hear and learn something of those Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
Conversing familiarly with the <hi>Iews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. The <hi>Iewish</hi> Notions and Customs might
easily be Communicated to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> seeing
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Writings were Translated into <hi>Greek</hi>
in the time of the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy, if not
before it (as<note n="a" place="bottom">Praep. Evang. lib. 9. c. 3.</note>

a Man well Skill'd in History, and who
lived with <hi>Seleucus,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the same
place affirms:) seeing there was a Greek Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
of a considerable part of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great's time, as

                        <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> Testifieth. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<hi>Demetrius Phalereus,</hi> Library-Keeper
to King <hi>Ptolomeo,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Philadelphus,</hi> in an
Epistle to him, which<note n="b" place="bottom">Praep. Evang. lib. 8. c. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Eusebius</hi> citeth, saith,
that before the Septuagint Version many things
were Translated out of the Bible. But this is
most certain, and agreed to by all, that upon
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great his Conquests, the <hi>Iews</hi>
and <hi>Greeks</hi> had converse with one another, and
were no longer Strangers, being now United
under the same Empire. And, as an effect of
this, soon after <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, all the
Old Testament was entirely Translated into
Greek by Seventy two <hi>Iews,</hi> whom the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
King of <hi>Egypt</hi> appointed for that purpose.
Hence the knowledge of those things contained
in the Sacred Writings could not but be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>4. This Communication was made by the
Travels of Philosophers, and inquisitive Men
among the <hi>Pagans.</hi> Of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> we are told
by<note n="c" place="bottom">In vit. Pythag.</note> 
                        <hi>Laertius,</hi> that <q>when he was young,

                        </q>
And particularly he testifies that he

the <hi>Alexandrian, Porphyry,</hi> and others,
that he went into <hi>Chaldea</hi> in the time of the

thinks that he Travel'd also into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and

It is most evident to all that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd
with this Author's Writings, that there
are sundry things in them above the strain
of common Philosophy, as concerning the
Creation of the World, the Formation of the
First Man out of the Earth, the Innocent and

Happy State of Mankind, the loss of that Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive

Sons of Men, with many other Particulars
which are fetch'd from the Sacred Writings.
I might mention likewise how loftily he speaks
of God, and his Nature, how admirably he
Discourses of the Soul, how clearly he asserts
a Future Life, and the Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of another World, how feelingly he
treats of Vertue and Goodness, how Divinely
he writes concerning Religion, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
as Pure and Spiritual, and Purged
from the Heathen Superstitions. This Sublime
and Extraordinary Knowledge the Ancients
think he gained by Travelling into <hi>Syria, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi>
and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and holding converse with
those that understood the inspired Writings.
And it is their Opinion, that though he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd
with some of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, and
imbibed their Sentiments, yet he carefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids
mentioning their Name, because they
were odious to other Nations, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
those structures of true Theology which are
in his Works would have fared the worse for
it. But though he would not speak this out
plainly, yet he seems to utter it in a disguised
manner: Perhaps he hinteth that he receiv'd
those Notions from the <hi>Iews,</hi> when he mentions

Great Philosophers, as <hi>Solon, Democritus, Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus,</hi>
&amp;c. Travel'd into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi>
is testified by <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> in their Lives.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:46315:149"/>
The same is attested by<note n="a" place="bottom">Lib. 2. Cap. ult.</note> 
                        <hi>Diodorus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Orpheus, Musaeus, Homer, Lycurgus,</hi>
and other Wise <hi>Grecians, viz.</hi> That they went
and visited those Foreign Parts, and thence
came furnish'd with the Knowledge of those
things which they had learnt in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
The like is confirmed by the testimony
of some<note n="b" place="bottom">Euseb. Praep. Evang. l. 10. Cyril. Alexand. contra Iuliarum. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Christian</hi> Fathers, who also add
that those Chief Philosophers of <hi>Greece,</hi> when
they sojourn'd among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> learn'd
many things of their Priests, which they had
from the Tradition of the <hi>Iews</hi> who had been
among them: And there they perused the
<hi>Mosaick</hi> Writings, which were of great account
among some of them. Hence the Religion,
Rites, and Practices Recorded in those Books
were divulg'd and spread abroad in the World.
Indeed it is very probable in the Nature of
the thing it self that this would happen: for
the <hi>Iews</hi> being a People so Renowned for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and their Fame and Glory being every
where Celebrated, it could not be but that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
People, especially the most Philosophical
and Inquisitive among them, should be desirous
to confer with the Bible, or <hi>Iewish</hi> Authors,
and to know their Laws, Ways, and Customs,
and that whole Nations should be forward to
imitate and make use of them. This is more
than Prophetically intimated, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 6.
where 'tis said, that when <hi>the Nations shall hear
all those</hi> Excellent <hi>Statutes</hi> given to the <hi>Iews,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46315:149"/>
They shall say, surely this great Nation is a wise
and understanding People.</hi> If the Pagans should
so admire and value the <hi>Iewish</hi> Customs and
Ceremonies, they would (as the consequent of
that) imitate and practise them. Thus you have
a Rational Account of the Consonancy of Pagan
Writings and Customs to the Sacred Scriptures,
you see how they were derived from these
Fountains.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, I am to enquire, <hi>how the
Scriptural Stories and Truths came to be corrupted;</hi>
whence it is, that they are mixed with Obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Falsity in the Writings of the Pagans,
how it comes to pass, that one thing is put for
another, and that it is so hard oftentimes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
what they deliver. I will give you
an Account of this, in these following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,</p>
                     <p>1. The confusion of Languages did not a little
contribute to these Mistakes, Corruptions and
Falsities. When the World was of one Tongue,
the notices of things which were imparted by
Speech, were very clear and intelligible; when
they all joyn'd in one Language, they could
easily apprehend one another, and there could
arise no mistakes, by Ambiguity in the variety
of words. But upon confounding the first I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and dividing it into many, there follow'd a
great disorder among Mankind, for then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
difficult to understand one another. The
Words being confused, the Conceptions and
Things which were convey'd to Men by those
words, were also confused, obscure, and uncertain.
The variety and multiplicity of Words, begot mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46315:150"/>
and confusions; among so many millions
of words, it was impossible, but that there
should be a great many ambiguous and equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
and thence the Phrases, Sentences, and
Speeches, must needs be so too. This is one
Reason, why the Sacred Truths of Scripture
were corrupted, when they came into the
Hands of the Heathens. The <hi>Eastern</hi> words and
forms of speaking, were misunderstood by the
<hi>Grecians;</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Dialect and Idiom were
mistaken by the People of another Language and
Country: The Oriental Expressions were
misinterpreted by the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who were
Strangers to the literal and proper Sense of
them. Hence arose Fables, Fancies, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Conceits, which they mixed with the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Verities, and almost defaced and extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them.</p>
                     <p>2. The Sacred History of Scripture, and the
Traditions of the First Ages of the World,
were easily corrupted, because they were Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Ignorant and Barbarous People. God
was pleas'd not to vouchsafe that Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which he bestowed on his
own People, but he thought fit to leave them in
that darkness and blindness, which their gross
Sins had brought them to, and which were
now become the just Punishment of them. Many
of them were so besotted, that when they heard
of those Holy and Mysterious Truths, they were
not able to bear them, they could not apprehend
the true meaning and import of them. But
because some of them, who were the most Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mplative,
would be exercising themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46315:150"/>
them, they resolved to make something of
them, or out of them: And accordingly, when
they committed them to Writing, they applied
them to some Person or Thing, which was
known and famous among them; and thus an
Historical passage in Holy Scripture, became a
Story of their own, or a Divine Truth was
turn'd into a Fable. By this means, the things
which they borrowed from the Word of God,
came to be D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>praved and Disguised.</p>
                     <p>3. The long tract of Time and diversity of
years, have partly introduced this corruption
and alteration. For length of time blotted
out some of the former Accounts, and defaced
the Memoirs of things. The Antient Names
of several Persons and Places are worn out, and
others (quite different from them) are used in
their stead. The true Original, Occasion, and
Meaning of many things were forgotten, and
in place of them, New, but False Relations,
crept in. Then came to pass at last, (when the
right Notions of things were worn out) that
Men of Poetry and Invention, thrust upon silly
People their own Fancies and Conceits, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
them to accept of the most unlikely Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
for Truth.</p>
                     <p>4. The Historical passages of Scripture, and
the strange Events which hapned among the
<hi>Iews,</hi> being spread abroad, and passing through
<hi>many</hi> Hands, or rather Mouths, could not but
for that Reason be corrupted. By the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Relators they were changed, some
adding to them, and others diminishing them,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46315:151"/>
so that at the last, they were quite different
from what they were at first.</p>
                     <p>5. As Superstition and Idolatry increased, the
greater Corruptions there were of True Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Men making that to Administer to their
Idolatrous Worship. So that in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
especially where there were the fiercest
Bigots for the Pagan Devotion, there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
a more plentiful coyning of these Fables,
under which were hid very useful Truths, taken
out of the Old Testament.</p>
                     <p>6. This must be added, that it was the Custom
of the Antient Pagans, to wrap up their Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>dark Terms,</hi> and to represent
them in an Aenigmatical way.<note n="a" place="bottom">Contr. Cels. <hi>lib.</hi> 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Origen</hi> thinks
<hi>Plato</hi> in one of his pieces, hath something of
that <hi>Paradise,</hi> which <hi>Moses</hi> in the beginning of
his Writings speaks of, and he gives this Reason
why he thinks so, <hi>viz.</hi> because it is <hi>Plato's</hi> usual
way to describe things obscurely, and to disguise
the greatest and most excellent Verities, under the
vail of Mysteries and Fables. And this was the
guise of others, besides <hi>Plato,</hi> especially of the
Pagan Poets; they affected obscurity and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of Stile; whence sprang several of the
Fabulous Histories of the Gods, and other odd
passages in their Writings. And so, when they
took some things of moment from Scripture, or
from those who were acquainted with those
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46315:151"/>
Sacred Records, they cloath'd them with their
dark and Mystical Expressions, in so much, that
it was hard to know whence they had them.</p>
                     <p>7. The <hi>Grecian</hi> Humour, was to <hi>Invent</hi> and
<hi>Romance;</hi> their Poets especially (who were their
first Writers) were famous for this. They
abused, mangled, jumbled, and confounded the
Stories in Holy Writ, they turn'd those Sacred
Things, into Magical Pranks sometimes, and
from the Names of Holy Persons spoken of in
the Old Testament, they took occasion to invent
new Deities, and shape new Gods. Their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
practice was to piece out Scripture with
their own Fancies, and to add something of
their own heads. This is owing to the <hi>Greek</hi>
Vanity, it is to be ascribed to the Levity and
Capriciousness of these Fabulous Men, whose
very Genius led them to affect Banter and
Fictions. The Poets dealt with Sacred History,
as the Legendaries do with the Lives of Saints;
they have some general ground for what they
say, but they make plentiful additions to it;
there is perhaps something of Truth at bottom,
but then you have their own Inventions besides.
Thus the <hi>Grecian</hi> Writers counterfeited all along
the shape of Real Truths, in most of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
there was a medly of Falshood and Truth
together.</p>
                     <p>8. This is also certain, that the Pagan Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers,
did out of <hi>fear</hi> sometimes disguise
the Notions of Truth, which they received from
Scripture. <hi>Plato,</hi> saith <hi>Iustin</hi> the <hi>Martyr,</hi> had
learnt in <hi>Egypt</hi> the True Doctrine concerning
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46315:152"/>
God, One only God, with several other Sacred
Truths, but, lest some <hi>Melitus</hi> or <hi>Anytus</hi> should
Accuse him, he would not divulge them to
the People: For fear of incurring <hi>Socrates's</hi>
Misfortune, he either conceal'd or disguis'd all.
He dreaded the Poysonous Cup, and so would
not discover those Sacred Things, but rather
chose to lap them up in Poetick Conceits and
Fables, in Mysteries and Riddles, which his
Writings are full of. And this it is likely was
the Case of other Philosophers and Writers
among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they were Timorous, and
dared not Transgress the Publick Laws, and
incur the punishment due to Innovators in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
and therefore they spoke ambiguously and
obscurely, and corrupted those Truths which
they had received from the Holy Fountains.</p>
                     <p>9. Some out of meer <hi>Ignorance</hi> of the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Religion and Affairs, misrepresent and corrupt
those things. This is seen plainly in <hi>Strabo,</hi>
and <hi>Diodorus</hi> the <hi>Sici<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ian,</hi> who (as was hinted
afore) make the <hi>Iews</hi> to be <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and
<note n="a" place="bottom">Lib. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Strabo</hi> particularly saith of <hi>Moses,</hi> that he
was an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priest. So <hi>Herodotus,</hi> because
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had lived among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> saith
those things of the former, which belong to the
latter, and so perhaps, <hi>vice versâ.</hi> I remember
he particularly saith, that<note n="b" place="bottom">Lib: 2. cap. 36. &amp; 104.</note> Circumcision was
first of all used among the <hi>Ethyopians</hi> and <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
and from them went to the <hi>Phaenicians</hi>
                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:46315:152"/>
and <hi>Syrians,</hi> and thence some thought <hi>Abraham</hi>
receiv'd this Rite, and commended it to his
Posterity. It is as easie to observe, how grosly
the <hi>Latin</hi> Writers were mistaken; it was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
thing with them to confound <hi>Iews</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and to make no distinction between them,
as I have shew'd on another occasion.<note n="a" place="bottom">Hist. lib. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Tacitus</hi>'s
description of the Nation and Religion of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> together with the Original of them, shews
that that Excellent Historian, was extremely
ignorant of the Affairs of that People. They
were at first call'd <hi>Idaei,</hi> faith he, from the
Mount Ida, and afterward by an addition of a
Letter, they had the Name of <hi>Iudaei.</hi> Their
<hi>Sabbath</hi> was Consecrated to <hi>Saturn,</hi> he saith;
and many such false and fabulous passages are to
be found in the Account which he gives of
them. So <hi>Iustin</hi> shamefully errs in several
things belonging to the <hi>Iewish</hi> History; he
makes <hi>Abraham</hi> the third King of the <hi>Iews,
Israel</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Ioseph</hi> the Fifth, and <hi>Moses</hi>
(whom he reckons to be <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Son) the Sixth.
In his whole Thirty Sixth Book, where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
the Original and Increase of the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Nation, he hath almost as many mistakes, as
words. The rest of the Pagan Historians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
mistake, when they Treat of that
People, because they did not rightly inform
themselves, and indeavour to have a perfect Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Matters. Thus <hi>Iosephus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
excuses in part the Heathen Writers, when
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46315:153"/>
they speak of things done in <hi>Iudea,</hi> imputing
their Errors to want of Knowledge and Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
Yea, he wonders not that the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Nation was not known to some of them, and that
they write not a word of it; for the most dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Historians,<note n="a" place="bottom">Contr. <hi>Apionem.</hi> l. 1.</note> saith he, were ignorant of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and he instances in <hi>Ephorus,</hi>
who he observes had so little knowledge of
<hi>Spain,</hi> that he took it for one single City, and
no more. We might observe likewise, that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or nothing is mention'd of this our Isle of
<hi>Britain,</hi> either by <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Historians,
before <hi>Casar</hi>'s Commentaries. And in the same
place he takes notice, that neither <hi>Herodotus</hi> nor
<hi>Thucydides,</hi> nor any that were of that Age make
mention of <hi>Rome,</hi> although it had been in great
power a long time, and had waged so many
Wars. He adds, that <hi>all Things of the Greeks
are new, and of yesterday,</hi> giving this as one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why the <hi>Greek</hi> Historians make no mention
of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Affairs. They were themselves
but upstarts in respect of the <hi>Iews.</hi> But though
they knew but little of them, yet they feigned
many things, and represented them as they
pleas'd. Especially their Poets? who were very
ignorant of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Institution, and of the
true meaning of the most things which they had
from those of that Nation, or from their Books,
yet took the liberty to invent and add, and to
mingle their own Conceits and Fancies, with
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46315:153"/>
that little which they had heard or knew of
them.</p>
                     <p>10. Some, if not most of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> out
of <hi>Averseness</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> to the <hi>Iews,</hi> perverted
those things which had any Relation to that
People. This was a Nation that was separated
from all others, and was different from, not to
say contrary to, the rest of the World in many
things; wherefore they grew odious and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable,
and the Pagans wilfully Misrepresented
and Traduced them, and delighted to load
them with all sorts of Calumnies. All Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
bandied against the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi>
they were all in League against these, however
they disagreed among themselves. Hence it is,
that when-ever they present their Readers with
any thing concerning them, they generally shew
that Ill-Will which they bore to them. Thus
<hi>Manethon</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Historian, though he
hath many things that agree with what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
saith of the <hi>Iews,</hi> yet he mis-represents se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
particulars, and adds others in disgrace of
<hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Israelites.</hi> And indeed from
<hi>Egypt</hi> was the rise of those Malicious Calumnies
against them, for the People of that Nation
were sensible of, and retain'd in their Minds the
many <hi>Plagues</hi> that were inflicted on them for
their sakes, and the last Mortal Farewel in the
<hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and they expressed their implacable
prejudice against them, by reproaching them, and
they taught others to do so too. Thus<note n="a" place="bottom">Hist. lib. 36.</note> 
                        <hi>Iustin</hi>

(or rather <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi> whom he Epitomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes)
tells us, that the <hi>Iews</hi> were expell'd <hi>Egypt,</hi>
because God had Reveal'd to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>
that the Plague which then raged among them,
could by no other way be allay'd, than by that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's
being turn'd out. <hi>Diodorus</hi> the <hi>Sicilian,</hi> and
<note n="a" place="bottom">Hist. lib. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Tacitus</hi> write, that the <hi>Iews</hi> were thrust out
of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the Inhabitants, because they were
Scabby and Leprous. <hi>Apion,</hi> with a detestable
Impudence, rails against this People, and, out of
meer malice, invents and forges Lies to disgrace
them. He not only repeats the foresaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
<hi>viz.</hi> That they were expell'd out of that
Country, because their Bodies were over-run
with Leprosie, but he adds several others, and
miserably perverts the History of <hi>Moses.</hi>

might proceed from <hi>Ignorance</hi> only, that some
of the Pagan Historians reckon these in the

what wonderful things these Great Men had
done in <hi>Egypt;</hi> the one, when he grapled with

of Dreams, and they concluded they were

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46315:154"/>
even the mistakes of these <hi>Gentile</hi> Writers,
concerning them and others, shew, that they
had heard of such Men, and the things they did,
and they are a Testimony of the reality of the
History in general. Then, as for the Pagan
<hi>Poets,</hi> the same prejudice and Hatred reigned
in them, and discover'd themselves in Lies and
Fictions about the <hi>Iews,</hi> and what is related
concerning them in the Old Testament. When
they refer to any passage in the Sacred Story,
they malitiously desile it with their own Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
they distort and falsly deliver the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances,
and they blend it so with their own

                        </gap> suitable punishment. Thus, one <hi>Theopompus,</hi>
who had inserted some passages of the Bible into
his Writings, was struck with Madness; and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:46315:155"/>
another named <hi>Theodectes,</hi> who made use of
some place of Scripture, in a Tragedy of his,
was almost deprived of his sight for it; but the
former, when he was made sensible of his fault,
was restor'd to a right mind again, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
upon acknowledging the like Offence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
his Eye-sight. This was related, saith
<hi>Iosephus,</hi> to King <hi>Ptolomee</hi> by the foresaid
<hi>Demetrius,</hi> a very serious Man, and it was
assigned as a Reason, why the Contents of these
Sacred Writings, which were so Divine and
Admirable, were but rarely mention'd by the
Historians and Poets. These Examples had
struck a terrour into some of them; having
heard how some Prophaners of these Holy
Things, were Animadverted upon, by a Divine
Hand, they were afraid to Record any passages
in the Old Testament. Therefore, some of
them chose rather, to disguise the Sacred Stories,
and to stuff them with Fabulous Narrations, that
they might scarcely be known, to have been bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from that Holy Book.</p>

make them contemptible and ridiculous. They
did it, that those Divine and Sacred Things
might be despised, and that they might be turn'd
into Superstition and Idolatry. So likewise,
they cunningly mixed something of sacred
Truth with Fables, that thereby they might
make the things that are True to be suspected.
<hi>Satban</hi> is desirous to pervert and even erase the
whole Sacred Scripture and Antient Truth, but
because he sees he cannot effect this, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
contrives how he may disguise the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Stories,
he sets the Poets to work to
make them into Fables, and thinks by that
means to take off our Esteem of those Inspired
Writings, and to diminish that Credit which
we ought to give to those Sacred Truths. He
pushed on those <hi>Grecian</hi> Wits, to obscure and
deface the Old Names in Scripture, that the
Original of them might not be known. He out
of direct malice, moved those fanciful Men to
invent Fables, to defame the Primitive Stories,
to blemish the Sacred History, to obscure and
pervert the Truth. The Poets turning the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46315:156"/>
Scriptures into Fabulous Narrations, was the
way to invalidate the Testimony of them, and
to make them seem a meer Poetick Fiction, a
Dream, a Fansie, that hath no real bottom. It
is no wonder then, that the Devil imped their
Fancies, and assisted their Inventions, and help'd
them to change the Truth into a Lie, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he might rob God and the Scripture of their
Honour. This, I say, might be a device of
that Evil Spirit, (as he hath Devices and Wiles
of all sorts) to elude the Authority of Sacred
History, and to take away the Credit of Divine
Truth.</p>
                     <p>Again, as that Crasty Spirit designs by
this means to disparage, yea, to null the Truth,
so he thinks hereby to gain assent to Falshood,
and to promote the greatest Impiety imaginable;
for when Truth is mixed with Falshood, he
hopes that this latter will be entertain'd for the
sake of the former. And when Lewd and Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Practices, are founded in those that are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and Religious, he expects, that these
should justifie those. Perhaps, when he added
the Sacred Ceremonies of the <hi>Iews,</hi> to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Worship of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he thought
thereby, to take away the difference between
them, and to render them alike; so that Men
should not be able to distinguish, between a True
and False way of Worship.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the Devil's Design in introducing
several Sacred rites and Customs, into the
practice of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> was to conciliate
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46315:156"/>
to himself a greater Authority and Esteem,
a greater Glory and Repute among them.
He commends those things to the Pagans
which were Religiously used, and even by
God's own People, and prescrib'd by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
this he doth to inveigle the Pagan World,
and to bring them to Admire and Worship
him.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, an Answer may easily be return'd
to that <hi>Objection,</hi> of a late Learned Writer,
<note n="a" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Spencer,</hi> de Legib. Hebreorum. lib. 3. cap. 12. Dissert. 1.</note> 
                        <q>What advantage can the Devil have by
his imitating the Divine Worship?</q> He ever
Acts for some end that may be prositable to
himself; but how can this prove so, <q>seeing it
would be more advantageous to him, to insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
a Worship and Ceremonies, that are
Diametnically contrary to those in the Divine
Law, that by those, as by so many proper
and peculiar Characters, his Herd might be
distinguished from the Flock of the Shepherd
of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                        </q> The Answer, I say, to this, is
very easie and obvious, for there can be nothing
more <hi>Advantageous</hi> to that Evil Spirit, than his
emulating of Divine Worship, and appointing
Ceremonies suitable to it, for by this means, his
Kingdom is most sensibly advanced, and that with
the greatest Artifice and Craft imaginable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this Vile. Fiend is Adored, even whilst the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46315:157"/>
Divine Worship of the True God seems to be
earried on. It was the Subtilty of this Great
Mimick, to approach as near to God and True
Religion, as he could, to make use of those
things, which by God's own express Command
were used in his Worship. This is a cunning
way of gaining Proselytes, and increasing the
number of his Worshippers. Thus he Acts
for some <hi>End,</hi> and that a very <hi>Profitable</hi> one too;
certainly much more Profitable to him, than if
he had Instituted <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Peculiar Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
of Worship, for these would too palpably
have <hi>distinguish'd his Herd,</hi> from the <hi>True Flock;</hi>
whereas, those bring them into a kind of Rival<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with it. Besides, this fond Emulation in the
Devil, is a gratifying of his first Proud Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and aspiring to be like God. He is still
Ambitious of Divine Honour, otherwise cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
he would not have desired to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd
by the Son of God himself. And he
would be Worshipp'd in the <hi>same way,</hi> that God
is, with the same Signs and Badges of Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Hence most of those Sacred Rites enjoyned
by God himself, and made use of, in his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
by the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, were transferred
by Sathan to his Idolatrous and Impious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
This is the effect of his Haughty Spirit,
which thirsteth after Divine Honour, even such
as is given to the only True God.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have amply shew'd you, how it came
to pass, that the Rites and Practices, and the
greatest Truths contained in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
were corrupted, disguised, misapplied,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46315:157"/>
and abused by the Pagans. I have given you
the Reasons and Arguments which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

Consectaries drawn from the whole,
viz. That we cannot with any shew of
Reason admit of the Opinion of those who
hold that the Jews borrow'd all or most of
their Religious Rites from the Gentiles:
That from what hath been premised, we
may take notice of, and admire the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Providence of Heaven: That we are
ascertain'd of the Antiquity, Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and Certainty of our Religion: That
we are reconcil'd to the writings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Will now add unto Reason and Evidence
the <hi>Suffrage</hi> of the Learned and Wise,
whether Ancients or Moderns. It was averr'd
long since by <hi>Demetrius Phalereus,</hi> that Great
Historian and Philosopher, in an Epistle of his
to King <hi>Ptolomey,</hi> that the <hi>Gentile Philosophers
took many things from the Holy Scriptures,</hi> as
you will find him cited by <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his
<hi>Evangelical Preparation.</hi> This is an early Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
to the truth of what I have asserted:
By this it appears, that the Notion which I
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46315:159"/>
have offered, is above two thousand years
Old.<note n="a" place="bottom">

                        <hi>Iosephus,</hi> the Learned <hi>Iew,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
about half a thousand years after, attests
the same, and professedly proves that <hi>both

by the Christian Fathers, as <hi>Tatianus,</hi>
who hath a set<note n="b" place="bottom">Ad Gentiles.</note> Oration on this Subject,
that what Learning the <hi>Greeks</hi> gloried in, was

<hi>Antioch</hi> (who lived likewise in the Second Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury)
asserts this in defence of Christianity,
proving that whatever the Pagan Poets writ
of Hell, and the pains of it, and several
other Subjects in Divinity, was stolen from
the Writings of the inspired Prophets; and
that the Christian doctrine, which is in a great
part taken from them, is the Ancientest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

                        <hi>Iustin</hi> the Christian Philosopher
and martyr speaks to the like purpose, and
proves that all the true Notions in Theology
among the Pagans, sprang from <hi>Moses,</hi> and
the Holy Writings, and he instanceth in, and
enlargeth on many Particulars, shewing that
<hi>Orpheus, Homer,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> had several of their
Words, Phrases, Opinions, Traditions, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions
from the Prophetick Writings. He
maintains, that the Fables of <hi>Bacchus, Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
Aesculapius, &amp;c.</hi> were made out of the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46315:159"/>
depraved sense and meaning of the Holy Writ.
At another time he pursueth the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and attempts to demonstrate, that all
the Great and Brave things in the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
and Poets Writings are from the Holy
Book. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> is very copious
on this Theme: The Scope of the first Book
of his <hi>Stromata,</hi> is to shew, that the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was many Generations
older than that of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and in prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of this, he endeavours to evince<note n="a" place="bottom">

                           </gap>.</note> that
<hi>the Opinions of the Greek Philosophers and others,
were taken from</hi> Moses, <hi>and other</hi> Hebrews.
And in the Second Book of his <hi>Stromata,</hi> he
farther insisteth on this Subject, and proves,
that the <hi>Greeks</hi> were <hi>Notorious</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

And so he goes on in the following Books to
prove, that all the good Notions among the

Excellent Truths the former taught, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the latter, they Sacrilegiously took them
from the Holy Patriarchs and <hi>Iews.</hi> This is
the sense of the forty seventh Chapter of

things from them. Yea,<note n="a" place="bottom">Omnia adversùs veritatem de ipsâ veritate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structa sunt.</note> those very Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which the <hi>Pagans</hi> bring against the
Christian Truth, are fetch'd from it, as I
observ'd from him before. I have mention'd
<hi>Origen</hi> already, but if you consult his Fourth
Book against <hi>Celsus,</hi> you will find this more
largely asserted, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Pagan Rites
and Stories were taken from the Scriptures.
<hi>Eusebius</hi> likewise hath been quoted before,
but if the Reader think good to peruse the
Author, he will see this Argument insisted
on in<note n="b" place="bottom">Praep Evang. <hi>lib. 9. 10, 11, 12, &amp;</hi> 13. partim.</note> four or five Books together, where
he proves that the <hi>Greeks</hi> had some under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Theology, and follow'd
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Writers in several things, which
he makes good by alledging several passages
out of <hi>Theophrastus, Hecataeus, Porphyrius, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius,

goes on, and more designedly clears this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
that what is good in the Writings of
the Gentile Philosophers, is all stoln from the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> and that the Wisdom of the <hi>Greeks</hi>
especially came from the <hi>Iews.</hi> I might add
the Testimony of<note n="c" place="bottom">De Doctr. Christian. <hi>lib.</hi> 2.</note> St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> who shews
that the <hi>Platonists</hi> borrowed from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:

sufficiently. From these I have quoted, you
may see that what I have maintained in this
Discourse is no idle fancy, no notion taken
up by shallow Heads, but that the deepest Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:46315:162"/>
the most Judicious and Impartial
Pens have adopted it for a Truth. We
have it upon the Authority of all these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Persons, and many more in former,
in later, and even in our present times, as
well as upon the plain Evidences, Reasons,
and Arguments before alledged, that the
Ancient Philosophers and Poets borrowed
from the Bible, that many of the Gentile
Fables are founded on the most Sacred Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that the Scripture is the Source and
Fountain from whence many of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Customs, and Practices sprang, that most
of the Gentile Theology arose from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
and depraved sense of the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Old Testament.</p>
                     <p>From the whole let me offer these three
or four Consectaries. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We cannot with any
shew of Reason admit of that Opinion which
holds that the <hi>Iews</hi> borrowed all or most
of their Religious Rites and Ceremonies from
the Gentiles. This, though it bids desiance
to that <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Testimony</hi> which I have
produced, hath had some Abbettors and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons.
Thus<note n="a" place="bottom">Con. Cels. <hi>l.</hi> 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Origen</hi> acquaints us that
<hi>Celsus</hi> stifly maintain'd that the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
was borrowed from the Fables of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.
And with him other Heathens at
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46315:163"/>
that time concurred; and, to defend their
Idolatrous Traditions and Usages, asserted
that Scripture History was a corruption of
some of their Fables. The Story of the <hi>Flood</hi>
they said was taken from <hi>Deucalion,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi>
from <hi>Alcinous's Gardens,</hi> and the <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Sodom and Gomorrah</hi> from <hi>Phaeton</hi>'s
setting the World on fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Origen</hi>
shews the absurdity of these allegations, from
the Antiquity of those Relations in Sacred
Scripture, and thence proves that the <hi>Greeks</hi>
had these from the <hi>Iews,</hi> and not on the
contrary. He makes it evident that the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Nation had the Original Traditions, and that
others were corrupted and changed from
these by the Heathens. This Pagan Conceit,
which was taken up on purpose as an eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
against Christianity, is revived by some
Writers of late, but by none more designed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and industriously carried on and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
than by a late Learned Man of our own,
who hath delivered such admirable and choice

these (in <hi>Deut. 12. 30, 31, 32. Take heed to

The Rites and Ceremonies which they used
in Worshipping their Gods, were abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to the God of <hi>Israel:</hi> Wherefore it
is absurd to think that he would appoint
his People such Religious Rites and Services
as were <hi>abominable</hi> and <hi>hateful</hi> to him: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you will say, that which was abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Heathens, was not so in God's
own People. But this increases the absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
rather than takes it away. No Man of
sober thoughts can talk after this rate; for
if God disliked those things in the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Worshippers, it is certain that he did
much more so in the true ones. Wherefore
he instituted such a Service as was most
opposite to the Heathen way of Worship,
and had not the least affinity with it. Hence
it is added, <hi>what thing soever I command
you, observe to do it;</hi> as much as to say,
you must not follow the directions or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of those Pagaus in your Worshipping
of me, you must do nothing in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
but what I expresly Command you,
neither <hi>adding thereto,</hi> nor <hi>diminishing from
it.</hi> How then can any Man with Reason as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
that the <hi>Iews</hi> borrowed their Rites in
Religious Worship from the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> A Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of so bright an intellect, as our Learned
Author is, cannot but see the force of this
Text, and be convinc'd that it ruines his
Hypothesis, which he was pleas'd to take
up it may be only to give proof of his own
Skill to the Learned World, and to try that
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:46315:166"/>
of his Opponents. So much for the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary
from the preceeding Discourse.</p>
                     <p>2. From the Premises we may learn the
<hi>Excellency of our Religion, viz.</hi> 1. That it is
the <hi>Ancientest</hi> Religion in the World. We
may plainly see the Footsteps of it in the
oldest Times that were. The memory of it
is among the most Celebrated Monuments of
Antiquity. The Truths of it are to be read
in the Histories of the First Ages, yea, in
the Fables of the Old Poets, in the rusty
and antique fragments of the Primitive Times
of the World. 2. See the <hi>Reasonableness</hi>
(which is another Excellency) of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Many of the Scripture-Truths were
receiv'd by the Philosophers and Sages among
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had no other Conduct than
that of their Rational Faculties. These Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Reason entertain'd some of the Grand
Principles of our Religion, and approved of
them, and acknowledg'd them as Rational.
3. See the <hi>Certainty</hi> of our Holy Religion. It
is attested not only by Friends, but Enemies.
It hath even the Approbation of <hi>Heathen</hi>
Writers, who have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Recorded, and thereby
confirmed some of the most remarkable things
reported in the Sacred Writings, as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World, our first Parents Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
and afterwards their Fall, <hi>Noa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>'s</hi>
Flood, the long Lives of the first Persons,
the Building of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> the
Confusion of Languages, the Renowned Acts
of several of the Patriarchs and first Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:46315:167"/>
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is a great establishing of our
Faith, that those Pagans derived so many
things from Scripture. The <hi>Gentile</hi> Writers
vouch a great part of our Religion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must needs imbrace it when it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
by such Disinteressed Persons.</p>
                     <p>3. We ought to take notice of the <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Providence of God</hi> in this matter. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
the Scripture is attested by those who
never owned its Authority, yea, the very
Enemies of these Holy Writings rati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ie the
Truth and Certainty of them. The Heathen
Poets, whilst they Corrupt Divine Truth,
assert it. Their very Lies and Fictions bear
witness to the Sacred Verities: their Fables
confirm the Infallibility of the Bible. <hi>This
is the Lord's doing;</hi> here the Great and
Over-ruling Wisdom of God is seen. Here
his Almighty Power in ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ing Satan's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
and Designs may be discern'd. He
(as was said before) intended the Corruption
of the Scriptures, the silencing of the Truth,
the Exalting of himself, and the Advancing
of his Kingdom. But the All-Wise and
Powerful Moderator of the World disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
his Designs, and made this thing we
are speaking of serviceable and beneficial to
Religion; he made it become an Argument
of its <hi>Antiquity, Reasonableness,</hi> and <hi>Certainty,</hi>
against the Cavils of Atheists, and Infidels.</p>
                     <p>4. Henceforth we are reconciled to the
Writings of Prophane Authors. We have this
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:46315:167"/>
considerable advantage by reading the Works
of the Ancient Heathens, and by perusing
their Stories and Fables, that we shall find
some Greater Thing couched in them than
the bare Narrative. For these Writers bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd
many things from the Holy Book; their
broken Stories are often-times an imperfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Scripture Relations. Sundry things in
their Writings are gather'd out of the Divine
Volume, but are strangely wrested, pervertrd,
and obscured, by having new Names, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eigned Circumstances affix'd to them. Almost
all the <hi>Gentile</hi> Fables, and Theology, flowed
from a depraved sense of the Sacred Writings.
The Poets disguise true Stories with many
Fictions, and some Reliques of Divine Truth
are buried under their ingenuous Fancies, and
Fabulous Narrations. <hi>Ovid</hi> Transcribed the
Greek Theology from <hi>Orpheus, Homer, Hesiod,</hi>
and other Ancient Poets, and these had it from
the Bible. The very Poetick Fictions refer
unto real Story, and are drawn from the Divine
Source of Truth. So that we are reading the
Holy Scripture in a manner whilst we are
turning over Pagan Writers. In these we meet
with Truths Transplanted from the Sacred
Book, we find many passages stollen from the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Fountains. It is not to be denied then
that Scholars, and Students, yea, the very
Candidates of Sacred Theology, may with great
profit prie into these Writings of the Pagans,
for here are the footsteps of Divine Verities. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and Sacred Learning are to be joyn'd.
The <hi>Gentile</hi> Monuments illustrate the inspired
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:46315:168"/>
ones. We may, notwithstanding the disguise
which Poets have put upon the Stories, see the
foundation of them, and perceive that those
vain Figments<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> are grounded on some Solid
Truth, and that a Sacred Treasure lies hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
those confused Fables. For this is not to be
denied, that <hi>Palestine</hi> afforded <hi>Greece</hi> matter of
fancy, and invention; the <hi>Pagan Poets</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended
by the <hi>Iews, Athens</hi> was indebted to
<hi>Ierusalem, Parnassus</hi> was beholding to <hi>Sinai,</hi>
and <hi>Helicon</hi> to <hi>Iordan.</hi> You see then the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
we may reap by being acquainted with
Prophane Writers, whilst we look further than
the outward shape which they have given to
many things, and search into that Truth which
lies hid under it, even the Sacred and undoubted
History of the Old Testament. Thus we may
make them serviceable to far higher and better
ends than they are intended. This is the best
improvement that can be made of them, to see
the true Source of what is written by them, to
understand whence they borrowed their matter,
and to confirm our selves in the belief of the
Truth of the Sacred Writings, by perusing
these which are Prophane.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>5thly,</hi> and lastly then, See the Authority,
Truth, and Certainty of the Holy Scriptures of
the Old Testament, which is the main thing I
have been aiming at. I had proved this before
by several Arguments, and those perhaps on
some accounts more Forcing and Convictive
than this: but I thought good to add this to
them, as no contemptible way of proving the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46315:168"/>
Antiquity and Authority of the Sacred Book.
The Truth of the Historical part of the Old
Testament is evidenced from Heathen Writers,
not only Historians, but Philosophers, and
Poets. A Man may, by comparing these with
the Sacred Volume, find out the Original of the
Pagan Traditions, and Fictions, and observe
the Lineaments of true and unquestionable Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
among them. Hence we shall have no
reason to doubt that there were such Persons
and Things in being, as are spoken of in the Old
Testament, and that the Passages and Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
there mention'd were real, and true.
This admirably serves to evince the <hi>Authority</hi> of
those Writings, this proves the <hi>Truth</hi> of the
Records of Holy Writ, and that they ought to
be received as the Oracles of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> as
Infallible.</p>

                        <hi>Iosephus</hi> the Jewish Historian relates the same, and

And in many other places of Scripture this Divine

Mankind, is set forth as a <hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Great Lord</hi> and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:46315:171"/>

and wield his Scepter over all Nations. Hence
this Rumour was spread among the Eastern Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and especially about the time of Christ's birth,
that a Great Lord or King should arise in those
parts, and spread his Dominion over the World.
Hence those Pagan and Jewish Writers before<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
mentioned, speak of this Great Ruler and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
who is no other than our Lord Christ, the
King of Kings and Lord of Lords. This they had
from the Prophesies of the Bible, where 'tis so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
fore-told that a King shall arise, and gain an
Universal Empire over Mankind. To this we
may refer that which<note n="*" place="margin">In Augusto Cap. 94.</note> 
                        <hi>Suetonius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
(and he quotes his Author for
it,) that a few Months before <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
was born there was this publick Prodigy,
<hi>viz.</hi> a Proclaiming of this, That<note n="†" place="margin">Regem po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo Romano naturam par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turire.</note> 
                        <hi>Nature was
bringing forth a King to the</hi> Roman
<hi>People.</hi> Whereupon the Senate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
allarmed and frighted, made a
strange Decree, That no one born
that Year should be Educated. This
Prodigy, without doubt, refer'd to <hi>Christ,</hi> whose
Birth was in <hi>Augustus</hi>'s Reign; this was the King
that was to be born to all the World, which was
then in a manner subject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
and therefore might be call'd the <hi>Roman People.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the <hi>Sibylls Oracles</hi> or <hi>Prophesies</hi> are of a <hi>middl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

nature and Consideration, and therefore are just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be treated of in this place: As they were
borrow'd from the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Testament</hi>
they belong indeed to the former part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
but as they attest the Truth of the mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
things in the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> they are reducible
to this. I will consider them first as they are
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:46315:171"/>
taken out of the Scriptures of the <hi>Old-Testament.</hi>
This may seem to be strange at first, because the
Opinions of Writers have run an other way; but
after I have plainly laid the matter before you, I
doubt not but the thing which I offer will easily
gain your assent, and then it will rather seem
strange that it was not taken notice of and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
before. There have been these four Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
among the Learned concerning the <hi>Sybills O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi>
or <hi>Verses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. Some say they are Counterfeit, yea, that
some Christians (but <hi>Hereticks</hi>) have imposed
upon the World in this matter. This I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for afterwards, because it will more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
be handled under the Second Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>viz.</hi> as they are used as an Attestation of the
Truth of the <hi>New-Testament.</hi> Indeed this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
rudely takes away the Subject of the Question,
and therefore must be consider'd in the last place:
in the mean time we suppose the thing spoken of
to be real, and not counterfeit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>2ly.</hi> Then, some have asserted that the <hi>Sibylls</hi>
were divinely Inspired, and consequently that their
Verses are Sacred and Divine. <hi>Iustin Martyr, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>obius,
Lactantius,</hi> and some other ancient Fathers
cry them up as equal to the <hi>holiest Prophets.</hi> As
God, say they, spake by the Prophets to the <hi>Iews</hi>
concerning <hi>Christ</hi> before he came, so he fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>told
him to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by the <hi>Sibylls,</hi> and the same
Prophetick Spirit was in the latter that was in the
former. <hi>Baronius, Bellarmine,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
generally think the same of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they use their Testimony as very Sacred, and
altogether Irrefragable. By the way, I might
observe, that they are sometimes quoted by these
and others of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to assert and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:46315:172"/>
countenance some of their <hi>Popish</hi> Doctrines: (So
that it seems <hi>Popery</hi> was a Religion before there
were any thoughts of it in the World, and before
it had a Being.) But here Authors are divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
for some hold these <hi>Gentile</hi> Prophetesses were
<hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Holy Person,</hi> others that they were <hi>not.</hi>
The former Opinion is grounded on that Tenent
of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Doctors, that never any vicious and
unhallowed Persons were honored with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Spirit, and that those Irradiations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Impressions of the Holy Ghost were
made only upon Men of holy Lives and innocent
Behaviours. Besides, these Prophetick Women
speak of One only True God, and they inveigh
against the False Gods and their Altars; which is
a sign they were good and religious People. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
have a contrary Opinion of them, and think
they were Irreligious and Prophane, for that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors before spoken of is
not always true, though it be generally so. We
read of <hi>Baalam,</hi> the Sorcerer of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> that
he prophesied concerning the future State of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and concerning the Coming of <hi>Christ. Saul</hi>
was a very bad Man, yet was endued with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Spirit. <hi>Caiphas,</hi> one of Christ's Judges,
was stirred up by the Holy Ghost to prophecy
concerning our Saviour's Death. And why might
not God inspire <hi>Heathen Women,</hi> though they were
<hi>Wicked,</hi> with a Spirit of Prophecy? And that
they were such seems to appear from their <hi>Verses,</hi>
wherein there are some things very Fond and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious,
(and so indeed they may be quoted
by the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks in defence of their
Cause.) This shews that they were not possessors
of true Virtue and Goodness. But then I ask this,
can we think that the choicest Mysteries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46315:172"/>
were revealed to them, if they were Wicked
and Prophane? Would God vouchsafe so great
and peculiar a Privilege to the worst of Persons?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>3ly.</hi> Therefore, some hold that these <hi>Pagan</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetesses
spake not by a <hi>good,</hi> but <hi>evil Spirit.</hi> The
Devil reveal'd these things to them, saith<note n="*" place="bottom">Comment. in 1. Epist. ad <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. cap.</note> St.
<hi>Ambrose,</hi> and helped them to fore-tell these future
Events. And some have turn'd those foresaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
this way, telling us that <hi>Baalam, Saul</hi> and
<hi>Caiphas,</hi> prophesied by the assistance of some <hi>Evil
Daemon.</hi> So the <hi>Heathen Oracles</hi> spoke truth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes,
though their Answers came from the
Infernal Spirits. That these Sibylls received their
Skill from Satan may be discern'd (say some)
in the Errors and Superstitions which are in their
Books, yea the Idolatries of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
by them in some passages which occur
in their Predictions. But then this may be said to
baffle this Opinion, that the fore-telling of such fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Contingencies is not in the power of that
Evil Spirit. Moreover, it is unlikely that these
<hi>Gentiles</hi> (were they informed by a Divine Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer,
but especially when they were acted by a
Diabolick one) should have as clear, nay a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
fore-sight and discovery of Christ to come, than
the <hi>Iews,</hi> God's own People, and the holiest Men
among them had.</p>

Vossius,</hi> that the <hi>Sibylline Verses</hi> (so call'd) were
made and collected by the <hi>Iews.</hi> This he asserts
only concerning those Writings of theirs which
were extant before Christ's coming: for the <hi>Iews</hi>
being dispersed over the World, and knowing that
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:46315:173"/>
                        <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Seventy Weeks were expiring, were stirred
up by God to compose these Verses, thereby to
signifie to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> the approaching of Christ.
But of the other Works of the <hi>Sibylls, viz.</hi> those
that were afterwards quoted by some of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
he hath not the same opinion and esteem,
but thinks they were made and compiled, or in
plain terms forged by some <hi>Christians,</hi> particularly
the <hi>Gnosticks.</hi> This is a very odd account of the
<hi>Sibylls,</hi> and shews that the Learned Author of it
was in a great streight: He was first willing to
reject the <hi>Christians</hi> from being the Composers of
those Writings (which some had asserted,) and
yet it seems afterwards he retracts that Sentiment,
and is not unwilling to believe that the <hi>Christians
themselves</hi> forged and counterfeited these <hi>Sibylline
Oracles.</hi> But if the <hi>Iews</hi> were the Authors of
some part of these Writings, then I ask, how came
they to insert things savouring of <hi>Heathen Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
and <hi>Idolatry?</hi> And if the <hi>Christians</hi> were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilers
of an other part of these Verses, how came
they to insist in the steps of the former, and to
add some things (as is said) in favor of those <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Corruptions?</hi> But I dismiss this as a divided and
dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>acted Opinion: Besides that I can't see why
the <hi>Iews</hi> might not as well have produced the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (for it had been translated into
<hi>Gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>k,</hi> a Tongue intelligible to the <hi>Pagan</hi> World,
a long time before our Saviours Coming:) that
had been more Authentick than any other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
whatsoever of their own Composing.</p>
                     <p>In the Fifth and Last place, I take leave to
propound an other Opinion, which is this, I hold
that these ancient Writings or Oracles were not
made by <hi>Iews,</hi> but <hi>Pagans,</hi> and particularly by
those Women call'd <hi>Sibylls,</hi> who <hi>made</hi> them in no
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46315:173"/>
other sense than this, that they took them out of
the Holy Scriptures of the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi> and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them into Verse. This is that which I assert
as most consonant to Reason; and it is a farther
Proof of what I have been so long insisting upon,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Pagans</hi> borrowed from the <hi>Bible.</hi> I am
not sollicitous whether these Women were good
or bad, whether they were moved by God or by
an Evil Spirit. There are some Inconveniencies
in asserting of either side. But there is a plain and
easie way different from both, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are
not to look upon them as Prophetick Persons, as
if they had a Gift of fore-telling all those things
they speak of. No, they only extracted what
they writ from the Scriptures, from the ancient
Prophesi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s therein contain'd, especially from that
of <hi>Isaiah.</hi> And so indeed in some sense their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
may be said to be Divine and Inspired; for
whatever these <hi>Pagans</hi> fore-told was no other than
what they took from the Inspired Prophets in holy
Writ. They are Instances of the like nature, with
those that I have so often produced in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Discourse, namely, <hi>Gentile Poets,</hi> that made
use of several passages in the Sacred Volume, and
inserted the main Substance of them into their
Verses. And as those <hi>Heathen Poets</hi> mingled pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane

and History (which I shew'd before) so
here it is as true that these <hi>Pagan</hi> Versifiers mixed
some things that were Superstitious with their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
of Christ and his Kingdom, which they
derived from the <hi>Old-Testament.</hi> It is well known
that there were <hi>Female Poets</hi> among the <hi>Pagans,</hi>
as <hi>Sapho,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore we need not scruple
to believe that the <hi>Sibylls</hi> writ in Verse. Indeed
the looseness and neglectfulness of the Stile shews
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46315:174"/>
that it was done by some easie <hi>Poets.</hi> That they
were <hi>Pagan Women</hi> is clear from the frequent Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> who represent them always
as such, and produce the Writings of these <hi>Pagans</hi>
as a proper Confutation of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> whom they
dispute against. And the <hi>Heathens</hi> themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
them to be such and no other, as is
apparent from what you shall h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ar afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Erythraea</hi> and the <hi>Cumaean Sibyll.</hi> Now,
concerning these <hi>Poetick Pagan Women,</hi> I assert
that they were no Prophetesses, no more than
<hi>Hesiod</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> and other <hi>Pagan</hi> Writers before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
and that they, like these, took some
things out of the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi> (which also were
much fam'd and talk'd of) and digested them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Numbers. It is undeniable that in their Verses
there are very notable Testimonies concerning
our Saviour; there are mentioned many conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Circumstances of his Birth, Life, Miracles,
Passion, Death, Resurrection, Ascension, and his
coming to Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but there is no more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to think that these were spoken by them from
a Prophetick Spirit, than to believe that <hi>Orpheus</hi>
and <hi>Homer</hi> were inspired when they refer to some
things that are in the Books of <hi>Moses.</hi> If these
had been <hi>Prophesies</hi> in a strict sense they would have
been communicated by God to his peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(to <hi>whom were committed his Oracles</hi>) rather
than to common <hi>Pagans.</hi> It is ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tain that these
were too Choice Secrets to be r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>eal'd to them.
Wherefore it is reasonable to conclude they were
taken out of the Prophesies of the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi>
which were spread abroad among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
The <hi>Sibylls</hi> only recite those Prophesies, but by
no means are you to think that they were Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
of their own. It is true, the <hi>Pagans</hi> hearing
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:46315:174"/>
of these Predictions, and not knowing the rise of
them, attributed them to their Prophetesses the
<hi>Sibylls;</hi> and so they passed for the <hi>Sibylls Oracles,</hi>
as if those Women made and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ndited them of their
own Heads. But they are the Oracles of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prophets,</hi> and not of any Persons among the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</hi>
The <hi>Sibylls</hi> are not the original Authors of
them, but they were borrowed from the Sacred
Volume of the <hi>Bible.</hi> This is the true Account
of the <hi>Sibylls</hi> Writings, and by this we are rid of
all the hard Consequences which may be drawn
from the fore-going Assertions. We need not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
our selves to enquire whether they had these
things by Divine A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>lation, or by the help of some
evil <hi>Daemon.</hi> We need not dispute whether they
could be endued with the Gift of Prophecy, and
yet be <hi>Pagans</hi> in their Persuasions and vitious in
their Lives; or whether, if they were acted by a
Diabolick Spirit, they could foretel things of this
sacred nature. For there is no necessity of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
either of these, because we can solve the
matter before us without supposing any thing of
this kind, <hi>viz.</hi> by holding that these <hi>Sibylls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> as
many others before them, took these things from
the ancient Prophets in Holy Scripture, and dress'd
them up after their own fashion. All things agree
very well with this Opinion, and we are press'd
with no Absurdities, insomuch that I have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
sometimes that this hath not been thought of
by the Inquisitive. This is yet a farther Evidence
of what I so largely pursued before, that the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
insert into their Writings several particular<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of
the <hi>Old-Testament:</hi> and at the same time it's a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the Truth and Certainty of the Evangelical
Writings,</hi> which is the next thing I offered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="332" facs="tcp:46315:175"/>Secondly then, I will consider the <hi>Sibylls Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and Verses,</hi> as they are a signal Attestation and
Confirmation of the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Behold here the main things relating to our
Blessed Saviour, plainly spoken of by these <hi>Pagans,</hi>
whose witness in this case is very considerable.
They declar'd in these Writings that there should
be a great Change in the World, and that a <hi>New
Governor</hi> or <hi>King</hi> should arise, and be very Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
<hi>Cic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>Sibylls,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate was mightily
allarm'd with it, and was affraid their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
would be turned into a Monarchy. Yea,
<hi>Lentulus</hi> began to take heart from this Prophecy,
(if you will believe <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Salust</hi>) and fancied
he was the <hi>King</hi> the <hi>Sibylls</hi> spoke of. And others
afterwards imagin'd that <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Augustus,</hi>
or (as some thought) <hi>Vespasian</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended:
whereas the plain truth is, that the <hi>Sibylls</hi>
had only divulged in their Verses the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies
concerning the <hi>Coming of the Messias,</hi> which
were found by them in the Holy Writings of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and began to be known at that time to the
World. If we had no more to alledge but this,
this were sufficient to prove the Authority of the
<hi>Sibylls</hi> Writings. They tell us in their Mystick
Verses that a <hi>Little Child</hi> should throw down Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
with his hand, and stop the Mouths of the

and which are recorded in the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

rely on them in their disputes against the <hi>Pagans</hi>
for Christianity. So doth <hi>Tertullian,</hi> so doth <hi>Origen,</hi>
arguing out of these <hi>Pagan Books</hi> for the Religion
which they had espoused. In Imitation of these
Learned <hi>Fathers, Constantine</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> in<note n="§" place="bottom">Ad Sanct. Caet. c. 18.</note> one of
his Orations, speaks very reverently of the <hi>Sibylls</hi>

                        <hi>Lactantius</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius</hi>
alledge them to prove the same. St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
quotes the <hi>Acrosticks</hi> of <hi>Sibylla Erythraea,</hi> and
turns them into Latin. Thus the <hi>Fathers</hi> used to

and the Old Christians constantly read these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and appeal'd to them in their Discourses

to be a notable Testimony to the Truth of

                        <hi>Fathers</hi> (as well as other Christian Brethren)
would not have quoted them to confirm the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion if they had been such. But we see
they did frequently alledge them to that end,
and especially in their Disputes with the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
As they made use of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
and Poets for attesting the Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iptures of the
<hi>Old-Testament,</hi> (as hath been shewed you) so they
cited these <hi>Gentile Prophetesses</hi> (for such they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
them to be) to assert the Writings of the
<hi>New Testament.</hi> It may be said that it doth not
absolutely and nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ssarily follow, that, because the
<hi>Fathers</hi> used the <hi>Sibylls</hi> Verses to confute the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi>
therefore they were true, for they might
suppose them to be such, though they did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
declare it. In answer to which I return,
that it cannot but be granted that there is a great
probability of these <hi>Sibylline</hi> Writings being true,
because they are quoted by the <hi>Fathers:</hi> For 1.
<hi>Many</hi> of these knowing Persons use their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
If one or two only did so, we could make
no conclusion from thence; but since it is certain
that great numbers of them (not only those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
named, but others) expresly appeal'd to those
Books, we cannot with any Reason slight their
Allegations. 2. If these Books were quoted by
the <hi>Fathers</hi> but seldom and rarely, there would
not be so great a Motive to attend to them; but
seeing we find them not only once, or twice, but
<hi>very often</hi> made use of by them, it argues that they
deliberately did it, and it invites us to give the
greater attention and credit to them. 3. They
quote them not as on <hi>Supposition</hi> only, but as <hi>True</hi>
and <hi>Genuine,</hi> and such as may and ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
on. 4. The <hi>Fathers</hi> were Persons that were
Competent Judges in this Case. Many of them
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:46315:177"/>
were Men of Sagacity and of a Critical Genius,
and were not easily to be imposed upon. They
had also time and leisure to examine these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and to enquire whether they were forged
or no; and we are sure it was their Concern to
do it, for their Religion depended much upon it.
Wherefore those who blast the Authority of the
<hi>Fathers</hi> in this point, have little reason to do so.
They were no credulous Fools, and such who
took up any thing on trust; they were able to
discern these Writings to be Counterfeit, (if they
had been such) as well as any other Persons.</p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding this, there have been of
old, and are of late, several Men that reject the
<hi>Sibylls</hi> Writings, as Spurious and Counterfeit.
And who should forge them but Christians? Here
then I am obliged to answer that Cavil, that the
Writings which go under the name of the <hi>Sibylls</hi>
were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>orged by <hi>Christian Hereticks.</hi> This, it seems,
was an old Objection, for <hi>Origen</hi> acquaints us that
it was made by the Arch <hi>Pagan Celsus.</hi> And <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius</hi>
after him, saith that this Objection was
renewed against the <hi>Sibylls</hi> Books by some other
<hi>Pagan</hi> Adversaries, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were forged by
some Christians themselves. Behold also the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns</hi>

uses all ways to prove them to be Forgeries and
Impostures: and he holds they were the Fictions
of some busie Christians, who had the boldness to
impose upon the World by these Cheats and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.
As many of the ancient Christians and

his Works, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> testifies in the Life of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
and saith they are translated into <hi>Latin</hi>

Poem of a mad and frentick Person, for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
and Contrivance of the Verse argues the
contrary, and shews attention of Mind, Skill, and
Diligence. These <hi>Sibylline</hi> Verses, the Initial Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

lived before our Saviour's time. If then they
were extant and famous before Christ's Birth, it is
impossible they could be invented by the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
Whence it is plain, that all the Writings of
the <hi>Sibylls</hi> were not obtruded by <hi>Christians,</hi> unless

Again, <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Fourth <hi>Eclogue</hi> is not denied to be
the same now that it was at first; and yet there
he Comments on the <hi>Cumaean Sibyll</hi>'s <hi>Oracle,</hi> which
is a clear Prediction of <hi>Christ.</hi> Accordingly, in

                        </note> part of this Poem is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

by the Evangelical Prophet, <hi>A Virgin shall

every thing that is in its kind the <hi>greatest</hi> is called

transcribed out of that <hi>Sibyll</hi>'s Verses, and were
meant of Christ's Coming, and the happy state of
the World which should accompany it, which are
frequently spoken of in the <hi>Old-Testament,</hi> whence
the <hi>Sibyll</hi> borrow'd these Prophesies. No Man
can have the face to say that These, made use of

its rise afterwards.</p>
                     <p>I might go on still and shew that the <hi>Sibylls
Oracles</hi> (or some of them at least) were mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Authors before our Saviour's time, as by
<hi>Plato</hi> in his <hi>Phaedrus;</hi> by<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Or the Author of the Book</hi> De Mirabilib. Auscultationib.</note>

makes mention of her of <hi>Delphos,</hi> by<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Diodorus</hi> the

                        <hi>Pausanias,</hi> who speak of

and <hi>Eratosthenes</hi> hath written of the <hi>Samian

we are assured from the Testimony of these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who lived before Christ's Nativity, that there
were such Persons among the <hi>Heathens,</hi> noted for
their Enthusiastick and Prophetick Genius, as they
suppos'd. Now, what Man, in his Wits, dares
say that the <hi>Christians</hi> forg'd the Verses of these
<hi>Sibylls,</hi> when there were no <hi>Chrstians</hi> at that time?</p>
                     <p>2. Let it be considered how signally it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by God's Providence that some of these
Books of the <hi>Sibylls</hi> should be <hi>evidenced</hi> to be true
and genuine. Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore Christ's Coming the Verses
of these Poetick Women were enquir'd into by the
<hi>Gentiles;</hi> they were searched and compared with
other Copies, and the Spurious ones were reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the rest kept and safely laid up, so that the
<hi>Christians</hi> might alledge them (as they did) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
suspition of Imposture. These Books were
first offer'd to <hi>Tarquin</hi> King of the <hi>Romans</hi> at that
time, who bought some of them and deposited
them in the Capitol, and appointed Officers on
purpose to take care of them, as is related by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
credible<note n="§" place="bottom">Dionys. Halicarn. Valer. Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, A. Gellius, Pliny, Lactantius.</note> Writers. In that place the Books
continued till the Capitol was burnt, which was
about fourscore Years before Christ's Birth. And
after it was rebuilt, Messengers were dispatched
by the Senate into <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> to search for
these <hi>Sibylls</hi> Verses, and accordingly a thousand of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46315:179"/>
were brought and laid up in the new Capitol. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
afterwards that were carefully collected were
placed in golden Boxes in the Temple of <hi>Apollo;</hi>
and when ever there was any great Affair on foot
these Oracles were consulted, as appears from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
good Historians. Both<note n="*" place="bottom">Annal. lib. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Tacitus</hi> and<note n="†" place="bottom">In Augusto. c. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi>
testifie, that when these Writings had been
sought out and fetch'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> they were by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>'s
command diligently examined and review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Senate, and by the <hi>Quindecemviri,</hi> that
the true Copies might be known from the False.
Wherefore there is not the least colour of Reason
to think that these Books which were thus search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into, and examined so strictly, were Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit;
much less is there any possibility that these
ancient Writings could be Figments of the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ns;</hi>
for they could not feign them before they
were in being.</p>
                     <p>3. Nor is there any <hi>ground</hi> to think that the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
of the <hi>Sibylls</hi> Verses, now extant, <hi>as to the
main,</hi> is not the same with that which was before
our Saviour's days, or that <hi>Heretical Christians</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
it, and added to it. For first, if they did so,
why is it not shew'd what Heresie, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>alse Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
they upheld, and maintain'd by these Additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Supplements of theirs? I see nothing of
this made out by our Adversaries. Again, If these
Writings had been the forgeries of <hi>Christians,</hi> the
<hi>Heathens</hi> would have certainly, at one time or
other, laid open this Cheat, and let the World know
there were no such Verses. But none of them
ever pretended to do any thing of this nature;
wherefore no Man of consistent. Thoughts can
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:46315:180"/>
imagine that these Writings were the meer Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some <hi>Christians.</hi> Nay, I could add from
good Authors, that not only <hi>Heathens,</hi> but <hi>Iews,</hi>
made frequent use of these Celebrated Books, and
several of them were brought to embrace the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith by reading the Contents of them; and
truly when they saw many things fulfill'd which
are here spoken of and fore told, it could not but
induce them to think well of Christianity. Whence
it is plain, that they had no suspition of these
Writings; they had no such apprehension as some
since have formed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> that they were a Cheat,
and that some <hi>Christians</hi> were the Authors of it.
And then, as for using of <hi>Pious Frauds</hi> to vouch
Christianity, there is as little ground for that; for
seeing they had such a <hi>Cloud of Witnesses</hi> of all sorts
to attest the Truth of the Christian Religion, it
was altogether superfluous and unnecessary to
counterfeit any. Or, if we should suppose any
such thing, and grant that some ill-minded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
inserted some things of their own into the
<hi>Sibylls</hi> Writings, yet it doth not follow thence
that all is Spurious and Counterfeit. I know some
condemn all, and others allow every thing that
goes under the name of the <hi>Sibylls Oracles</hi> But I
know no cause for either, but the usual one,
namely, that Writers must run directly counter to
one an other. This is their practise generally,
but it is no good one, and I have no Inclination
to follow it. I take an other way, the middle
one. I do not think that all the Verses that bear
their names are theirs, and genuine; and I am
far from thinking that all are Counterfeit. What
if we grant that <hi>some things</hi> in the Collection of the
<hi>Sibylls</hi> W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itings (as in many others) are alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed
and super-added? Can we conclude from thence
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:46315:180"/>
that every thing in them is changed and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
No surely. There were Counterfeit <hi>Gospels</hi>
written, but these do not prejudice the others
which are True: So there are many Pieces go
under the names of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which are Spurious,
but we do not reject the rest of their Works because
of them. Thus perhaps it may be here; some
Christians might add a few things, they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
some Verses that mention those individual
Acts, and particular Works of our Saviour, with
some Circumstances which are no where menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in the Prophesies of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> This
perhaps they might do; I cannot wholly deny it,
but this is no Argument that the main of these
Books was not composed before Christ's time, and
is Genuine and Authentick. Nay, we are certain
that the date of them was long before: I hope I
have sufficiently demonstrated that; Therefore
let us not condemn the whole for the sake of a
small part. We are certain that many things
quoted out of them by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and which are
the clearest Attestations of the Sacred Truths of
the Bible, are not Supposititious and Forged. We
are <hi>certain</hi> that some of their Writings were extant
before there were any Christians to corrupt and
adulterate them; and many of the particular
Passages quoted by the <hi>Fathers</hi> in these Writings
are now to be found, and are the very same that
they were then, and consequently they are now
as good a Testimony of the Truth of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as they were at that time.</p>
                     <p>But it is also <hi>Objected,</hi> that the <hi>Number</hi> of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylline</hi>
Books is unknown, and we can neither tell
how many the <hi>Sibylls</hi> or their Writings were; and
as for their Quality and Condition of Life, these
are uncertainly delivered. Nor do we well know
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46315:181"/>
their Names, as appears from this, that <hi>Cumaea</hi> in
<hi>Virgil</hi> is put for <hi>Cumana,</hi> and other Mistakes there
are. It is true, the Opinions were various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
these things; their Names and Verses are
often confounded, and it is hard to distinguish
them from one another. This is granted, and

this is no Argument against what we have assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
It is not material how many the <hi>Sibylls</hi> or
their Writings were; it is frivolous to insist upon
this. They might all of them been put into one,
if Authors pleas'd; or they might divide them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
more, as the way at some Coffee Houses now
is to deal out Pamphlets. Wherefore there is no
reason to reject them on this account, seeing we
have proved that their Books (were they more,
or fewer) are owned as to the main by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Primitive Christians to be true, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they were frequently made use of by them
as sufficient Witnesses to the Truth of a great part
of the Christian Religion.</p>
                     <p>And as for those <hi>Moderns,</hi> who have rejected
these Witnesses, we may, with reference to them,
take up that Lamentation of a late<note n="*" place="bottom">Vossius de Sibyl. Orac. cap. 11.</note> Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
(who himself is partly guilty of the Fault he
complains of) <hi>Verily the Christian Religion hath no
Enemies more set against it than Christians themselves;
for you may observe, that there is searcely any Prophecy
or Testimony to be found concerning Christ among the
Ancients, which many even of the most Learned Men
have not endeavoured to weaken, yea utterly to destroy
and annull.</hi> This is a very deplorable Thing, but
it were easie to prove it most true in several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
You will meet with some of them in the
following part of this Discourse, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
in the Testimony concerning <hi>Christ</hi> which
<hi>Iosephus</hi> gives. But this which is now before us, is
as Signal a one as any that can be named; for the
<hi>Sibylls Verses</hi> are very express Attestations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our Saviour and his Great Undertakings.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:46315:182"/>
Yet how strangely do <hi>Christian Men</hi> endeavor to
enfeeble, yea, to baffle and subvert these Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials
concerning our <hi>Lord?</hi> They tell us they
are the Forgeries of <hi>Iews,</hi> and the Impostures of
<hi>Heretical Christians,</hi> and all manner of Objections
they invent against them; yea, a late<note n="*" place="bottom">Servatius Gallaeus.</note> Writer
pronounces these <hi>Sibylls</hi> to be mad and frentick
People, and so there is no heed to be given to
what they say. When it hath pleased God to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
us such a remarkable Confirmation of our
Religion from the Mouths of <hi>Pagans,</hi> is it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
Ingratitude thus to vilisie and reject it?
Is it not an Argument of a vile and perverse Spirit
to use all means, and those very shameful ones
too, to disprove that plain Evidence which these
<hi>Sibylls</hi> bring, and to shut their Ears to that repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Testimony which they give to Christianity
and the Blessed Author of it? In short, the <hi>Pagans</hi>
had their <hi>Temples,</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and
<hi>Oblations,</hi> and <hi>Prayers;</hi> and they had also their
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Sibylls Books.</hi> In these was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the <hi>Council of God;</hi> for the <hi>Sibylls,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the import of their Name, were <hi>Interpreters
of God's will</hi> to the Heathens. In these were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
fore-told the Birth of the Holy Jesus, and
many other remarkable things relating to Him:
By these Oracles the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were pre-admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Christ's Coming; it seemed good to God
to prepare them for the Gospel, by these Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
and Messengers, as he did the <hi>Iews</hi> by
their extraordinary Prophets. And they are use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to <hi>Us</hi> as well as to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> we may be
fortified in the Belief of our holy Religion by what
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:46315:182"/>
they delivered. They give a plain and clear suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage
for Christianity and the Founder of it. The
ancient Christians thought their Writings to be
Authentick Records, though now some are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to slight and vilifie them. They look'd upon
them as good Evidences of the Christian Faith,
and of the <hi>New-Testament</hi> which containeth it;
and there is still the same Reason that we should
esteem them as such, especially since the Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to prove the falsity of these Books are very
mean and weak. Therefore (to conclude) till
they can produce better Reasons against these Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonials,
I think we may safely and reasonably
make use of them.</p>

But to understand this Author a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ight, we must
know, that it was common with the <hi>Pagan</hi> Writers
to confound the Names of the <hi>Iews</hi> and the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
and to say that of one which appertain'd
to the other; (nor is it a Wonder that <hi>Christians</hi>
for a time were called <hi>Iews,</hi> because the first <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
were of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation) Accordingly by
the <hi>Iews</hi> here (who he saith were expell'd out of
<hi>Rome</hi>) are meant <hi>Christians,</hi> who were lookt upon
by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as Seditious and Tumultuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
because their Master and Founder was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
such a one. And so when this Writer saith
they raised Tumults <hi>impulsore Chresto,</hi> the meaning
is, they were set on by His Example; He, though
dead, had a great Influence upon them, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them up to do what they did. Or, if you will
understand <hi>Iews</hi> here in the strictest Sense, <hi>viz.</hi>
such as profess <hi>Iudaism,</hi> then it may refer to
<hi>Theudas</hi>'s Insurrection, who, though he was an
<hi>Egyptian,</hi> as some gather from <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 38. yet he
headed the Mutinous <hi>Iews;</hi> which gave just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to the Emperor to banish all of that Nation
and Religion from <hi>Rome.</hi> And because (as I have
said) the name of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous
among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> thence <hi>Chrestus,</hi> i. e.
<hi>Christ</hi> is said to be their Ringleader and Impulsor.
<hi>Pliny</hi> the Younger mentions the <hi>Christians</hi> and
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46315:184"/>
                        <hi>Christ</hi> by name, for<note n="*" place="bottom">Epist. 97. lib. 10.</note> he tells the Emperor that
some that were brought before him upon Suspition
of being <hi>Christians,</hi> were found to be Persons of
another Perswasion, for upon his Sollicitation
they refused not to <hi>Curse Christ.</hi> This was the
Appellation he was known by to the <hi>Gentile</hi> Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
and this is the very Title which the <hi>New-Testament</hi>
so often giveth him. Thus far then the
<hi>Pagans</hi> bear witness to the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>But from the <hi>Name</hi> I pass to the <hi>Person</hi> and his
<hi>Actions,</hi> and most of the great and notable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
which accompanied his <hi>Birth, Life</hi> and
<hi>Death.</hi> First, we will speak of those four remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
things which attended his <hi>Birth.</hi> namely the
<hi>Particular Time</hi> of it, the <hi>General Tax,</hi> the <hi>Wonderful
Star,</hi> and the <hi>Murdering of the Infants of Bethlehem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, Those known Adversaries of Christianity,
the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> testifie that Christ was to
come at that <hi>very Time</hi> when he came. It was the
universally receiv'd Tradition of <hi>Elias,</hi> that after
four Thousand Years the Messias should be born;
for though that Celebrated Saying or Prophecy
in the <hi>Talmud</hi> of Two thousand Years before the
Law, and two Thousand after it, be not exactly
true, for there were about Two Thousand five
Hundred Years from the Creation to the Law,
and from the giving of the Law to Christ there
were not above Sixteen or Seventeen Hundred
Years, yet the Prophecy may be made use of to
convince the <hi>Iews,</hi> that the Messias is come, and
it is a plain Indication of the <hi>Time</hi> when he was
expected by them, even that Time when he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the World with his Presence on Earth. Hence
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:46315:185"/>
it is that (when Christ was brought to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>

Provinces, and so when there should be occasion
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46315:186"/>
for a Subsidy he could take his measures hence.
For tho this <hi>Tax,</hi> which St. <hi>Luke</hi> mentions, be not
a Pecuniary one, yet it was in order to it. This
Registring, this Enrolling of every Person was to
this purpose, that they might more easily be taxed
or sessed by the Head. And whereas it is said <hi>all
the World was Taxed</hi> or Enrolled, it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
(though not to <hi>Iudaea</hi> only, as some
imagine, yet) to the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> All that
were under the Dominion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,
at that time, were book'd and registred to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
aforesaid. This being a thing so well known
we may expect that the <hi>Pagan</hi> History, as well as
that of the Gospel should take notice of it; and
accordingly we find <hi>Dio, Iosephus,</hi> and <hi>Tacitus,</hi>
making mention of it.</p>
                     <p>I know some are unwilling to grant that it is
the same Tax mentioned by St. <hi>Luke,</hi> because it is
said, <hi>this Taxing was first made when</hi> Cyrenius <hi>was
Governor of</hi> Syria, <hi>Chap. 2. v.</hi> 2. Now it is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
by <hi>Iosephus</hi> and others, that <hi>Quintilius Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
(not <hi>Cyrenius</hi>) was President of <hi>Syria</hi> at that
time of Christ's Birth, and the same Authors
relate that <hi>Augustus</hi> taxed the Empire in that
President's time. How then can they speak of the
same Taxing which St. <hi>Luke</hi> Records? And More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
as for <hi>Cyrenius,</hi> he was, according to<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiqu. Jud. lib. 18. c. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi>
commissioned by the Emperor to make a
Tax, not about the time of Christ's Birth, but a
good while after. Whence it follows, that <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>'s
<hi>Taxing of the World,</hi> or ordering <hi>Cyrenius</hi> to
manage it, which is mention'd by the Evangelist,
is different from that Tax which the foresaid Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:46315:186"/>
speak of. Some answer the first Difficulty
thus, <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, <hi>Cyrenius</hi> for
<hi>Quintillius Varus,</hi> by the neglect and fault of the
Transcriber. This is the Opinion of <hi>Steuberus</hi> in
his Preface before <hi>Helvicus</hi>'s Tables, and also of
<hi>Ludovicus Capellus.</hi> But this is an ill way of solving
the Difficulty, because it disparageth the Holy
Text, and argueth it to be corrupted. If we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

we must impeach the S. Scriptures of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
Therefore the true Answer is this, That

conceive, is the true reconciling of this Passage of
St. <hi>Luke,</hi> with what you read in Prophane Authors.
It is rightly said, that <hi>Cyrenius was Governor of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
because he went with extraordinary Power
from the Emperor to govern and preside in that
particular Affair. This amounts in a manner to
what <hi>Drusius</hi> and <hi>Petavius</hi> say in this Case. <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>Varus</hi> and <hi>Cyrenius</hi> were join'd in the Work;
or one began it, and the other carried it on and

the disagreeing of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and the <hi>Iewish</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
about the time of <hi>Cyrenius</hi>'s Taxing, which

the former saith was in the Year when <hi>Christ</hi> was

of History; which may be the reason why it
is not taken notice of by many, nor insisted upon
by them. But we see it is not forgotten by some,
but particularly recorded by them, as is evident
from what hath been propounded. The same
may be farther evidenc'd from the <hi>Censual Tables</hi>
at <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein all Persons that were subject to

of Persons, it came to pass, (through the
wonderful Providence of God) that the Holy

Thus the Publick Records of <hi>Rome</hi> vouch the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story

                     <p>The Third remarkable Circumstance of <hi>Christ's
Birth</hi> was the <hi>appearing of a wonderful Star,</hi> Mat. 2.
2. 7. 9. which is also taken notice of by <hi>Heathen</hi>
Writers. There are great Disputes among the
Learned about this <hi>Star,</hi> which appear'd to the
<hi>Magi</hi> when our Saviour was born. Some have
said it was an <hi>Angel,</hi> some a <hi>fixed Star,</hi> others a
<hi>Planet,</hi> and it hath been thought by some to be a
<hi>Comet,</hi> or some lower <hi>Meteor.</hi> The true decision
of the quarrel is this, That this strange Apparition
was none of these, and yet it had something of
all these in it. It is probable some glorious <hi>Angel</hi>
presided, as an <hi>Intelligence,</hi> in this shining Body,
and directed its Course and Motion. It might
pass for a <hi>fixed Star</hi> or a <hi>Planet</hi> in respect of its
heighth, if you consider at what distance it was
seen.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 2. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>We have seen his Star in the East,</hi> said the

but that the meaning be thought to be
this, that they saw that Star, it being then in the
East, in those parts where they were, in those Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern

came along by the conduct of it to <hi>Iudea,</hi> then

Stars. It had also something of a <hi>Comet</hi> in this,
that<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 2. v. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>it came and stood over where the young Child
was,</hi> that is, as I conceive, it directly darted its
Beams in a Line, as it were, upon that very place
where the Holy Babe was; its glorious Train
which came from it spread it self towards that
quarter, and so this heavenly Light shew'd where
the House was that was bless'd with such a Guest.
In this respect also it had the nature of a <hi>Meteor,</hi>
that it was partly in the lower Region, and there
hover'd for a time. But if we strictly consider the
nature of this Apparition, we shall find, that it
really was none of these which I have named. It
was not an <hi>Angel,</hi> (although guided by one)
whatever some fanciful Men have imagined, for
this is not the way of the Holy Spirit's speaking
here, as you may see in this very Chapter, where
that particular sort of <hi>Messenger</hi> is called in plain
terms <hi>an Angel of the Lord, v.</hi> 13. and so again,
<hi>v.</hi> 19. It could be neither <hi>fixed Star</hi> nor <hi>Planet,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
both its Motion and Appearance were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted.
They saw it when they were in the
East, but it disappear'd afterwards, or moved an
other way when they came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they would not have asked (as they did)

                        <hi>Where is he that is born King of the</hi> Jews? It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
hence, that it did not shew 'em where Christ
was when they came at first to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> but
afterwards it appear'd again, and not only so, but
conducted them to the place where the Blessed

visit Christ till two years after he was born. But
this doth not follow thence, for the Star might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
a Year or two before Christ was born, and
give those Sages an Intimation of some strange
thing that was to come to pass; and 'tis likely that
after it had appeared a good while, and they were
throughly confirmed in their Perswasion, that
some great thing was to happen, as signified by
this new and unexpected Luminary in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
they set forwards towards <hi>Iudea,</hi> which
they knew was the Scene of the greatest Wonders
in the World, and they were a long time on their
Journy from those remote parts which they left,
(perhaps sometimes making a halt, or sometimes
going back, accordingly as their Apprehensions
and Surmises were concerning this new <hi>Phoena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi>
in the Heavens,) two Years or thereabout
might be spent from the time of the first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this heavenly Light till their arrival at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>
From this we gather that it was of great
Continuance, such as is never known to be the
duration of <hi>Comets.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some think this new Star appear'd only to the
<hi>Magi,</hi> because (say they) otherwise <hi>Herod</hi> would
not have so <hi>diligently enquired</hi> of them concerning
its appearing, for he might have learnt that of his
own Subjects. But to understand this aright, let
us observe the words,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 2. v. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Herod, when he had privily
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46315:190"/>
call'd the wise Men, enquired of them diligently what
time the Star appeared, i. e.</hi> either first what was the
time of its usual Rising, for it did not appear al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
night and day: Or secondly, Perhaps the
Inhabitants of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and other <hi>Iews,</hi> did not
observe it, it being no great and large one; but
these <hi>Magi,</hi> who were skill'd in the Stars, and took
notice when a new one shew'd it self, knew the
time of its rising; therefore <hi>Herod</hi> enquired of them.
Or thirdly, He enquired what was the time when
the Star began first to appear. And that This is
the true meaning, is evident from what is said in
the Sixteenth Verse of this Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<hi>Herod slew the Children from two Years old and under,
according to the time which he had enquired.</hi> Where
you see these two are joined together, and answer
to one another, the Age of the Children, and the
time since the appearing of the Star. <hi>Herod</hi> had
been told by the Wise Men that this had appear'd
about Two Years; therefore he ordered all Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
born within that time to be slain. Hence it is
plain, that the time of the Stars first shewing it
self, which was in those Regions where the Wise
Men inhabited, was the thing which <hi>Herod</hi> made
enquiry about, and in which he could not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
by his own Subjects. But it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
from this that the Star was not seen by them
at all, nor by <hi>Herod</hi> himself, because his enquiry
was not about the present appearing of it, but
only concerning the time of its first Appearance.
Besides, if it was seen of none but the <hi>Magi,</hi> then
it could not be expected it should be taken notice
of in the Writings of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>her <hi>Pagans;</hi> but we find that
it is taken notice of, which is the chief thing I am
concern'd in at present. The <hi>Sibylls</hi> in their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

wherein is<note n="*" place="bottom">There shall come a Star out of <hi>Jacob, Num.</hi> 24. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>Baalam</hi>'s Prophecy concerning the
<hi>Star,</hi> which though it is chiefly meant of Christ
himself, yet it may not exclude this unusual Star
which usher'd him into the World. But <hi>Virgil,</hi>

appear'd at Christ's Nativity, and which brought

                     <p>Again, <hi>Herod's murdering the Babes of</hi> Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,
is mention'd by Prophane Writers, as well

of it. But you will find it recounted more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly

his own Son. It seems this bloody Man had

Nor is there any mention of it in the other three

so much as make mention of. 2. Many things in

let us not wonder that this Historical Passage

as you have heard. It is probable that other <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, after <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Birth</hi> we are to consider
his <hi>Life,</hi> and some notable things which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
it, and to shew that these also are attested by
those that were professed Enemies of Christianity.
That there was such a one as <hi>Iesus</hi> who lived in
<hi>Iudea</hi> in <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s time, and did great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
things, and was followed by many of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and was acknowledged by them to be the
Messias, and sent from God, and was famous for
those Wonders and supernatural Effects which he
wrought in the sight of the People, is not disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the greatest Adversaries of the Christian
Religion. <hi>Hierocles</hi> freely confesseth it, as you
may read in <hi>Eusebius. Celsus, Iulian</hi> and <hi>Porphyry,</hi>
deny not the Miracles done by Christ and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
as several of the<note n="*" place="bottom">Origen cont. Celsum. Cyril cont. Julianum. Augustin. de Civ. Dei. l. 22. c. 8.</note> ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> assure us;
they confess the matter of Fact, that he cured the
Blind and Lame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they ascribe it to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick.
In short, they give assent and testimony to
the chief Passages of the Evangelical History con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our Saviour, (though they cavil at others,
and strive to consute them) They frankly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:46315:193"/>
that there was such a Person as <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi>
in the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> who declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be the Messias, and sent from Heaven to
Redeem and Save Mankind, and who Preached
those Doctrins which are recorded in the Gospels,
and acted those marvellous things which are set
down there. This Testimony of the <hi>Pagans</hi> is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable
and undeniable. And such is that of
the <hi>Iewish Writers,</hi> who frequently make mention
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and acknowledge there was such a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and that he lived at that time in which we
say he did, and that his doings were no less than
miraculous, and exceeding the power of Nature.
This the <hi>Iews,</hi> who then, or not long after lived,
report concerning Him, as you may see in the
<note n="*" place="bottom">Talmud Hierosolym. Sanhedrin, cap. 7. Talm. Bab. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin, Gem. 43. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Talmuds.</hi> To this purpose <hi>Buxtorf</hi> in his <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudick Lexicon</hi> may be consulted, and our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

where he hath abundant Proofs concerning the
matters of Fact mentioned in the Evangelical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
even out of <hi>Talmudick</hi> Authors. This is an
other Confirmation of the History of Christ the
True Messias.</p>
                     <p>Besides this, I will mention some things which
happened among the <hi>Pagans</hi> at that time when
Christ was on Earth, as an Assurance to us that
there was such a Man, and that he did such and
such things. Thus I might produce<note n="†" place="bottom">Eutropius, Hist. Compend. Nicephor. I. 1. c. 40.</note>

that the Originals were extant at that time when
he wrote his Ecclesiastical History. There is some
probability of this from what the Evangelist saith,
that<note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 4. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Christs Fame went throughout all Syria,</hi> and so
<hi>Abgarus,</hi> who was a King in that Country,

to hold a Communication with him by Writing.
And what though the Evangelists are wholly si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
about it? This is not to be wondred at, for
they omitted abundance of Passages belonging to
our Saviour's Life, as appears from <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 30.
21. 15. As for the Author of the foresaid Relation,
his Authority is unquestionable in this matter, for
he is universally acknowledg'd to be an honest
and faithful Historian; and here he declares to
the World that he saw the Originals of these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in <hi>Syriack</hi> at <hi>Edessa,</hi> and translated them thence
into <hi>Greek.</hi> It is indeed the peculiar Excellency
of this Historian, that he produces the ancient
Monuments for what he delivers. This makes
him a Writer worthy to be credited: For what
can be more desired than the citing of the Authors
and unquestionable Witnesses from whence he had
his Relations, and the inserting of Extracts faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
taken out of them, as is usual with those that
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46315:194"/>
write Annals? Observe it, he took these Epistles
out of the <hi>Syriack,</hi> in which they were writ; and
that is the reason why other Authors and Writers
before him speak nothing of them, they being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant

of these Epistles by a<note n="*" place="bottom">Da Pin Bibl. Patr. pag. 1.</note> Learned Divine of

                     <p>But suppose, after all, that these Epistles were
not really written by <hi>Christ</hi> and by <hi>Abgarus,</hi> yet
(notwithstanding this) they are no mean Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
for us. If we should only grant that <hi>Eusebius</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s of this Truth that such a one really was at that

to retain the Memory of their Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to
celebrate it by this particular Memorial inserted

our purpose; for though we should grant the

these in a poletick Remembrance of one whose

But I pass this by.</p>

                        <pb n="372" facs="tcp:46315:195"/>I could relate here what was done by <hi>Pagans</hi> in
Testimony of their <hi>acknowledging</hi> and <hi>approving</hi> of
Christ. Thus the Emperor <hi>Augustus</hi> refused the
Title of <hi>Lord,</hi> saith<note n="*" place="bottom">Hist. Rom. lib. 55.</note> 
                        <hi>Dio;</hi> and it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that he did it on our Saviour's Account.<note n="†" place="bottom">Paulus Orosius, lib. 6. cap. 20.</note>
Some indeed tell us that it was upon another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion,
<hi>viz.</hi> when at a Play <hi>Dominus aequus &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
was pronounced, and thereupon the People,
as if the words were said of <hi>Augustus,</hi> with great
signs of Joy shewed their Approbation of them,
the Emperor labour'd by signs to stifle their Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
and the day after put forth an Edict, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any to call him <hi>Lord.</hi> Such a thing as this
might happen, and yet the first and truest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to his refusing that Title might be with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to our <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> who was born not long
before. The reason to believe it is this, that this
Emperor was much changed after Christ's Birth,
and after the Fame of him was spread abroad,
he became a great favourer of the <hi>Iews</hi> and their
Religion, as <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Iew</hi> acquaints us in the
Account which he gives of his Embassy to <hi>Caius</hi>
in behalf of his Country-men of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> He
there relateth several particular kindnesses which
he shew'd to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation; and all grant
that <hi>Philo</hi> is a very credible Author in this case.
And though<note n="‖" place="bottom">In Octavio. cap. 93.</note> 
                        <hi>Suetonius</hi> gives an Instance of his
Aversion to the <hi>Iews</hi> and to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> it self, yet
it is likely this was before the other, and so it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanseth
the Emperor's after-Esteem and Favour
for that Nation and People. If you thus consider
that he was now much altered, it is not hard to
believe that his putting out the foresaid Edict was
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:46315:195"/>
done in honour to <hi>Christ:</hi> He would not be called
<hi>Lord</hi> after our <hi>Saviour</hi> was come into the World,
who was Lord of Lords and King of Kings. And
this may appear to be the more probable if that
be true which is farther related of <hi>Augustus,</hi> that
about the close of his Reign he inquired at <hi>Apollo</hi>'s
Oracle, who was to adminster the Affairs of the
Empire after him, and received this Answer,

proves this Eclipse at Christ's Passion out
of <hi>Phlegon Trallianus,</hi> (one of <hi>Trajans</hi> freed Men)
who it seems was a great Chronologer; and<note n="*" place="bottom">Chronicon. <hi>A. D.</hi> 33.</note> 
                        <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi>
mentions the same Author, and quotes his
words, which are these; <hi>In the Fourth Year of the
202 Olympiad, there happened a great Defection of the
Sun, such as was never known before. The Day at
the Sixth Hour was so turned into dark Night that the
Stars appeared in the Heavens.</hi> And he adds, <hi>There
was an Earthquake at the same time in</hi> Bithynia,
<hi>which over-turned several Houses in the City of</hi> Nice.
Thus that Writer. What could be more Accurate
seeing Christ's Passion was in the last Year of the
202 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> which was the <hi>18th</hi> year of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s
Reign? Or, if according to <hi>Scaliger,</hi> this be not
very punctual, (for the Eclipse at our Saviour's
Death, he saith; was in the beginning of the 203 <hi>d.
Olympiad</hi>) yet it is granted that a Years difference
here is of no great moment, especially when the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:46315:197"/>
time is so circumstantiated and fixed by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>for the Hour of the Day</hi> assign'd by <hi>Phlegon,</hi>
plainly shews that he relates the same thing which
St. <hi>Mark</hi> doth, who expresly affirms the Eclipse
to have happened at the <hi>Sixth Hour,</hi> Mark 15. 32.
Besides the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> the Companion of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse,
is said by this <hi>Phlegon</hi> to have been at the
same time, which agrees with St. <hi>Matthew c.</hi> 27.

                        <hi>Thallus,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> proves from <hi>Iulius Africanus,</hi>
who citeth this Author for this very purpose, and
sets down his words; and the same Testimony
you will find mentioned by <hi>Origen.</hi> Moreover,
<hi>Tertullian</hi> appeals to the <hi>Roman Archives</hi> about this
portentous Eclipse, and tells the <hi>Pagans</hi> that they
had this recorded in those Authentick Tables, yea,
that at the very moment when it happened it was
inserted into those publick Records. <hi>Lucian</hi> the
Martyr appeal'd to the same publick Acts of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> as<note n="‖" place="bottom">Eccl. Hist. l. 9. c. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Eusebius</hi> repors; he bids them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
their own Annals, and lets them know that
those would certifie them of the Truth of that
Eclipse. Shall I add to all these what <hi>Adrianus
Gressonius</hi> in his History of <hi>China</hi> saith, that those
People have registred it in their Annals, that at
that very time, about the Month of <hi>April,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
and irregular Eclipse of the Sun hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
at which strange and unusual thing <hi>Quam-vutius,</hi>
the Emperor of <hi>China,</hi> was exceedingly
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:46315:197"/>
troubled. Thus this Prodigy which was taken
notice of at Christ's Suffering on the Cross is
attested by <hi>Pagans,</hi> which is some accession to this
Truth related by the Evangelists. And it is the
more considerable, because we are certain that
That Eclipse was not natural, being in the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of the Moon, <hi>i. e.</hi> when the Moon was
Full; for it was the day before the Passover, which
fell on the<note n="*" place="bottom">Ex. 12. 2, 6.</note> Fourteenth Day of the first Month,
call'd <hi>Nisan,</hi> (which answers to our <hi>March,</hi>) when
the Moon was Full, and opposite to the Sun.
Now, it is known to be against the Rules of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strology
that the Sun should be eclipsed when the
Moon is at the Full; whence we must conclude
this Eclipse to have been Miraculous, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
against the course of Nature, and that it
could be the Hand of God only, to testifie <hi>Christ</hi>'s
Divinity. Lastly, We cannot but think that this
wonderful Eclipse was seen and observed by the
Enemies of Christianity, and acknowledg'd by
them to be a real Prodigy when we consider that
the Evangelists expose this Relation to those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Enemies of the Christian Religion, who if
such a thing had not happened could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
confuted the Reporters of it. Can it enter
into our Thoughts, that these Writers were so
foolish as to imagine they could impose upon the
Faith of Men in such a matter as this, which was
publickly to be seen, and which every one might
take notice of? This is an unreasonable and
groundless Surmise.</p>
                     <p>In the next place the <hi>Earthquake</hi> at Christ's Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
(which as you have heard, was attested by
<hi>Phlegon</hi>) is now more distinctly to be considered.
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:46315:198"/>
That Author indeed saith that it was in <hi>Bithynia,</hi>
but it might be in other Countries likewise. He
did not intend to relate how far it reach'd, but
what he knew, and in what place it was most
observ'd, he sets down. And this being join'd
with the Relation of the <hi>Eclipse,</hi> is an Argument,
(as hath been hinted before) that it refers to the
Earthquake at Christ's Passion, which not only
shook the Land of <hi>Iudea,</hi> but other remote
Countries, as the Lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> wherein this <hi>Bithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
was. For as the <hi>Eclipse</hi> was Universal, so was
the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> it is probable, and the whole
Earth felt the shock of it, though to some Places
only it proved destructive, as to this in <hi>Asia</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.

                        <hi>Pliny,</hi> who

it may more pertinently be made use of to shew
how our Saviour dispossessed the Devils, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenc'd
the <hi>Pagan Oracles,</hi> which were given by
them. Accordingly we find that <hi>Plutarch,</hi> from

<hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Iewish</hi> Witnesses that confirm all these,
yea, and more than what hath been hitherto te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,
namely Christ's Resurrection. As other
Governors and Deputies of Provinces used to send
an Account to the Emperors and Senate of the
most remarkable Things that happened in their
Provinces, so <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> Procurator of <hi>Iudea,</hi>
did the like, and his Relation is the more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
because it is the Testimony of a Person
who Condemn'd our Saviour to death. His Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or Letters rather (there being two of them)
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:46315:199"/>
to the Emperor <hi>Tiberius</hi> soon after Christ's Death,
give an Account of his Life, Miracles, Crucifixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and rising to life again. And as Publick
Acts were wont to be transmitted and reserved
in the Imperial Archives, so these were kept

                        <hi>Iustin

seen in the <hi>Acts</hi> of, or <hi>under Pontius Pilate,</hi> and
refers them to those as satisfactory and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
<hi>Tertullian</hi> with great boldness alledgeth the
same Records as a sufficient Confirmation of the
History of <hi>Christ</hi> in his <hi>Apology,</hi> c. 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Pearson,</hi> Epise. Cistr. Praecect. in Act. Apost.</note> one of the Learned'st Men of our Age
concludes that this ancient Father found this
among the Acts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, where all
things of this nature were set down. It is not to
be questioned, saith he, that <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> sent
this Account to <hi>Tiberius;</hi> if we consider that this
was the constant practise of all the Governors and
Deputies of Provinces to transmit the Relation
of every remarkable Occurrence to the Emperors
by whom they were placed in those Stations for
this purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> to inform them concerning
the Affairs of those particular Places. Now, the
Crucifying of our Saviour, and his Rising again,
were certainly very considerable and remarkable
Passages, and therefore 'tis not to be doubted,
that <hi>Pilate,</hi> as Procurator of <hi>Iudea,</hi> sent the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:46315:200"/>
a Relation of them. On which account
this Judicious Writer asserts the Authority of these
Letters; and there are <hi>other</hi> Arguments which
he useth to enforce the Truth of them, which are
worth the consulting. Thus it plainly appears
from the fore-mention'd Fathers, that there were
such Letters from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and that
there was such an Account of our Saviour extant
at that time; otherwise they would not have
made their Appeals to them in their <hi>Apologies,</hi>
otherwise they would not have call'd upon the
Emperors to consult their own Records which
testified of Christ and his Actions. Wherefore I

that <hi>Tiberius</hi> would have put <hi>Christ</hi> into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

things to him concerning Him; he refer'd the
Matter to the Senate, desiring them to rank Him
among those that were Worship'd and Deified,
but the Senate refused it, because they themselves
did not first order and approve of it, for it was an
old <hi>Roman</hi> Law, that no God should be set up by
the Emperor unless first approved of by the Senate;
for this reason only they rejected <hi>Christ</hi> from
being admitted among the Gods. However, the
Emperor still retain'd the same Reverence and
Esteem of <hi>Christ,</hi> as a most Divine Person, and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46315:200"/>
in Honour to him favoured the Christians, and

who received the Truth with delight. He brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to his Perswasion, both of the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles.
<hi>This was</hi> Christ, <hi>who though he was by the Instigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some of the Chief of our Nation, and by</hi> Pilate'<hi>s
Doom hung on the Cross, yet those who loved him at
first did not cease to do so, for he came to Life again the
third day, and appeared to them, the Divine Prophets
having fore-told these and infinite other Wonders of him;
and to this day remains that sort of Men, who have from
Him the name of</hi> Christians. Both <hi>Eusebius</hi> and
St. <hi>Ierom</hi> alledge this Famous Testimony of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> as an undeniable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of the Christian Religion. And the
latter of these Writers places this <hi>Iew</hi> among the
<hi>Ecclesiastical Writers of the Church,</hi> because he speaks
of our Saviour with this great respect. A<note n="*" place="bottom">Tanaquil Faber. Epist. 44.</note> late
Writer hath a great many idle foolish Cavils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this so notable a Memorial of <hi>Iosephus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
our blessed Lord. He thinks it strange
that <hi>Iustin Martyr, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus</hi>
writing against the <hi>Iews</hi> make no use of this
Testimony, especially that the first of these in his
<hi>Dialogue</hi> with <hi>Trypho</hi> (where his design is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
that <hi>Iew</hi> to Christianity) omits it wholly.
But to him that considers things aright this will
not seem strange; for if he looks into these Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
he will find, that their grand enterprize
and design were to convince the <hi>Iews</hi> out of the
<hi>Old-Testament,</hi> which they profess'd they heartily
believed and imbraced; and therefore those learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and pious Writers fixed here, and were not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
to go any farther. What need was there
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:46315:201"/>
of flying to human Authors when this divine and
inspired Volume furnished them with abundant
Arguments and Proofs against <hi>Iudaism?</hi> It would
have been unnecessary and superfluous to alledge
the Testimony of this Person, though never so cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
when they had so many infallible Authors
to vouch them and the Religion which they had
espoused. Again, this late Critick tells us that
this Testimony is against <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s mind, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a <hi>Iewish</hi> Priest, a legal Sacrificer, and most
tenacious of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion. He was of the
Sect of the Pharisees, and one of the Princes of
the <hi>Mosaick Church,</hi> therefore it is unlikely that he
would leave any such thing upon record in his
Writings. Those that know <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s Sect and
Life cannot believe, saith he, that these words
were his. Yes, they very well may, for he doth
not absolutely assert our Saviour to be the true
Messias, but only that he was the Person who was
called <hi>Christ,</hi> and that excellent Worth, and even
Divinity appeared in him; and he farther bears
witness that this excellent Person, who was of old
prophesied of, was not treated according to his
transcendent merits, but was barbarously put to
death by his Country-men, and yet that in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
manner he was revived, and thereby gave
an undeniable proof of his Innocency and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.
All this, though it be a most remarkable
Attestation of our Saviour, yet might have been
said (as really it was) by a <hi>Iewish Sacrificer,</hi> by
a strict <hi>Pharisee,</hi> by a tenacious asserter of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick</hi>
Riligion. The whole Testimony is but the
result of an unprejudiced and honest Mind, such
as this Historian was Master of. And if it be true
what this Criticizer mentions, and attempts to
prove out of <hi>Origen,</hi> that <hi>Iosephus</hi> had before this
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46315:202"/>
writ against <hi>Christ,</hi> the Testimony thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the more remarkable, because it is a great
argument of the irresistible power of the Truth,
and that there was a wonderful change wrought
in this Person. And truly this <hi>Objector</hi> himself
mentions that which may induce us to believe it;
for we read, saith he, in <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s Book which he
writ of his <hi>own Life,</hi> that he having gone through
all the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sects, was admitted at last into the
discipline of <hi>Banus,</hi> a Disciple of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist.</hi>
Thus this Author answers himself, and what he
had before objected, namely, that this Historian
wrote against his own mind, if these words of his
were true. It is not likely that he spoke contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his Perswasion, if he was entred into the
discipline of <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> who had been <hi>Christ</hi>'s
fore-runner, for thereby this Author imbibed a
good opinion (to say no more) of the Founder
of Christianity. What this Critick farther saith,
that if this Testimony were <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s, he would
have said a great deal more than he doth, is very
f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ivolous, and not worth taking notice of. And
so is that, that the <hi>Stile</hi> plainly betrays the Cheat,
it being <hi>frigid</hi> and <hi>lax, putid</hi> and <hi>inert,</hi> (as he saith)
whereas it is evident to any competent Judge, that
the Language is nothing of this nature, but is like
the rest of the Historian's Stile. Lastly, we are
beholding to him for finding out the Author of
the Cheat, who he affirms is <hi>Eusebius,</hi> as if he had
lived before or at the same time with <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that
is, as if one of the Fourth Century was contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
with him that flourish'd in the First. He pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Passage meerly out of design, namely, to gratifie
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:46315:202"/>
a party of Christians, and to carry on the Cause.
And that we may give credit to this, he falls very
severely on this worthy Man, and both ignorantly
and maliciously finds fault with him. This is the
course that our angry Critick takes; but no sober
and judicious Person can allow of it, for it may be
plainly discern'd that this Writer was resolv'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it to run down this Testimony of the <hi>Iewish
Historian</hi> by any kind of artifice whatsoever; but
when we come to examine the Methods he takes,
they are found to be of no force; what he offers
for proof is groundless, precarious and inconsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.
After all that he hath said, this <hi>Iewish Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi>
and the Credit of its <hi>Author,</hi> remain impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
What though we have granted that in
some things he is faulty (and where is their an
Historian that is not?) what though he omits
some remarkable Occurrences, and mistakes the
order of Time, of which he could not come to a
certain knowledge? Notwithstanding this, his
Testimony in this matter may be valid, nay, we
have all the reason imaginable to believe it is such,
for he was capable of attaining to a full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of what he here writeth. There is then no
ground to think that he imposed upon his Reader,
or spoke against his Perswasion, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
it is reasonable to look upon him as one that
freely uttered his mind, and shew'd himself to be
Ingenuous, Faithful, and Impartial. Such was he
esteemed to be by those<note n="*" place="bottom">Eusebius, Jerom, Isidore Pelusiot-Sozomen. &amp;c.</note> ancient Writers who
had oceasion to make use of his Testimony, and
such was his Character with all those Persons
who have since used the same in Confirmation of
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:46315:203"/>
the History of the Gospel. And truly it is a full
and pregnant Ratification of it, an attesting no
less than the Life, Death, and Resurrection of our
Saviour. This latter especially being attested by a
<hi>Iewish Priest,</hi> is considerable. This Person knew
nothing of that Cheat which the <hi>Iews</hi> labour'd
at first to put upon some, and therewith to stifle
the truth of <hi>Christ</hi>'s rising from the dead, namely,
that<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 28. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>his Disciples came by night and stole him away.</hi>
He tells us plainly and expresly, that <hi>Christ</hi> was
restor'd to Life on the Third Day after he
was put Death, which is exactly according to
the Narrative in the Gospels. I will conclude
then with the words which a Pious Father useth,
after he had recited <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s Testimony of Christ,

                        <hi>If our very Enemies,</hi> saith he, <hi>dare not oppose the truth,
who will shew himself so obstinate as not to give credit
to those things which are as clear as the Sun, yea,

<hi>Christ,</hi> we <hi>Christians</hi> are obliged to listen to their
Testimony, and to abominate the practise of
those who endeavour (and that with no little
art and pains) to enervate and destroy it.</p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Iosephus</hi> confirms the Truth of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
History, by relating several other things
which are recorded there. Thus<note n="‖" place="bottom">Antiqu. Jud. I. 18. c. 7.</note> he speaks of
the putting <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> to death, whom he
hugely extols, telling us <hi>that he was an excellent
Man, and stirred up the</hi> Jews <hi>to piety and vertue, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and purity, both of Body and Soul; and that</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod
<hi>caused him to be killed because he feared his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
would hurt him, and occasion a defection among
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:46315:203"/>
the People.</hi> He also relates how this <hi>Herod</hi> cast off
his own Wife, and took <hi>Herodias,</hi> who was his
Brother's Wife. This Author makes honourable
mention of<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiqu. l. 20. c. 8.</note> St. <hi>Iames,</hi> whom he calls <hi>the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Iesus Christ,</hi> and relates his Martyrdom,
and declares that the taking away his Life was so
flagitious a Sin, that it was in revenge of that that
the <hi>Iews</hi> were destroy'd, their Temple and City
burnt, and all other Evils befel that Nation. He
fully agrees with St. <hi>Luke</hi> in mentioning<note n="†" place="bottom">Antiqu. Jud. l. 19. c. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Herod's
Speech to the People,</hi> and their <hi>impious Flattery,</hi> and
the <hi>immediate Iudgment of God</hi> upon this Wicked
Man, by whose command that holy Apostle was
put to death. It is true, <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith not that he
was <hi>eaten up of Worms,</hi> but this is included in
that he saith he was <hi>seized with a sudden pain and
disease, and died in great torment of his Bowels,</hi> which
without doubt, were gnaw'd and devour'd by
those <hi>Worms</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> specifieth. Because this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
relates that <hi>Herod the Great,</hi> the Infant-slayer,
<note n="‖" place="bottom">An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiqu. Jud. lib. 17. c. 8. De bello Jud. l. 1. c. 21.</note> was infested and plagued with <hi>noisom Vermin</hi> in
his Body, therefore some say he is guilty of a great
mistake here, and speaks that of this <hi>Herod</hi> which
St. <hi>suke</hi> faith of the other, <hi>viz. Herod Agrippa.</hi>
But I do not see any reason for this imputation
of Guilt, because <hi>Herod the Great</hi> as well as the
<hi>other Herod,</hi> might dye of that filthy disease,
though it is not mention'd by St. <hi>Matthew</hi> or the
other Evangelists. Wherefore we have no reason
to think this Historian was mistaken, and disagrees
with the holy Writers. As to the main you will
find him concurring with them, not only in this,
but in other matters recorded by them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:46315:204"/>
you will find him attesting the verity
of the History of the Gospel, and you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that he is a very substantial Witness for the
Christian Religion.</p>
                     <p>Having produced these Testimonies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
St. <hi>Iohn</hi> and St. <hi>Iames,</hi> I might add some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
relating to St. <hi>Paul.</hi> That Insurrection
mention'd in <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 38. where you read that
the Tribune of the People said to St. <hi>Paul, Art
not thou that</hi> Egyptian <hi>who before these days didst
raise a Tumult, and leadest into the Wilderness four
thousand Men?</hi> That Insurrection, I say, is the
same with that taken notice of by<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiqu. l. 20. c. 6. De bello Jud. l. 2. c. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus</hi> more
than once, which was begun by an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> who
pretending to be a Prophet, gathered together
great numbers of <hi>Iews,</hi> the attempt and issue of
which are recorded by this Historian; and so it
is a Confirmation of what St. <hi>Luke</hi> here records
with reference to St. <hi>Paul.</hi> I will here add also
a <hi>Pagan</hi> Testimony concerning this Apostle, <hi>viz.</hi>
concerning his being <hi>caught up to the third Heaven,</hi>
mention'd by himself in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd

                     <p>To proceed, some have produc'd a <hi>Letter</hi> of
<hi>Seneca (Nero's</hi> Tutor) to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Answer to it. This is mentioned by<note n="‖" place="bottom">De Scriptor. Ecclesiast.</note> 
                        <hi>Ierom,</hi> who
reckons <hi>Seneca</hi> in the Catalogue of <hi>Ecclesiastical
Writers,</hi> because of this Epistle to the Apostle;
and<note n="‡" place="bottom">Epist. 14.</note> St. <hi>Augustin</hi> also takes notice of it. But I
am not so fond as to take in all sorts of Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
without any distinction; but I rather look
upon those Epistles as Spurious, the stile plainly
shewing that one of them at least (that to <hi>Seneca,</hi>)
is so. But because this <hi>Seneca</hi> was a grave and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Philosopher, and was against the Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and was far better than the
<hi>Pagans</hi> of that time, hence some thought he was
a <hi>Christian,</hi> and was so perswaded to be by St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
and then it was easily believed that they convers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, and had Correspondence by Letters.</p>
                     <p>Concerning St. <hi>Peter</hi> likewise I will only leave
this, and submit it to the censure of the Readers;
his encountring that Arch-Sorcerer, <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi>
(who is spoken of in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.) and his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting

though they are not mention'd in the infallible
Records of the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> yet are registred

For it seems, this Magician would needs be flying
in the Air, and by such artifices bring credit to
his false Doctrins; but St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
assistance of the Spirit, and the Efficacy
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:46315:205"/>
of his ardent Addresses to Heaven, baffled this

in his Life by this Historian. But this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in way of Conjecture only. Thus I

                     <p>I pass to another Historical matter recorded in
these Sacred Writings, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Universal Famine,</hi>
fore-told by <hi>Agabus, Acts</hi> 11. 28. which if you will
credit <hi>Pagan</hi> Historians, happen'd in accordingly
the fourth Year of <hi>Claudius</hi>'s Reign, and was over
all the World in the sixth Year.<note n="†" place="bottom">Hist. lib. 60.</note> 
                        <hi>Dion Cassius,</hi> who
had compiled his History out of the <hi>Fasti</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
through the several Years, speaks of this <hi>Famine</hi>
                        <pb n="394" facs="tcp:46315:206"/>

relief which was sent at that time by the Disciples

Place where the Famine exceedingly raged. Thus
we find that of <hi>Eusebius</hi> to be true, who speaking

us, that<note n="‖" place="bottom">

<hi>Predictions concerning the Overthrow of Ierusalem,</hi>
and some things which were to follow upon it,
and to shew that they are expresly confirm'd by
<hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Iews,</hi> In the <hi>24th</hi> Chapter of
St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the <hi>21st</hi> of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> (which

false Prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many;</hi>
i. e. they shall pretend to be Messiasses and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers
of the People, though indeed they are very
Impostors. Of the truth of this<note n="†" place="bottom">Antiqu. l. 20. c. 2. &amp; 3, 6. 7. &amp; de bel. Jud. 2. c. 11, 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you, who relates that there was a vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of these Pretenders and Mock-Saviours that
drew the People after them, particularly he tells
us of a certain <hi>Egyptian</hi> in <hi>Felix</hi>'s time, and of
<hi>Theudas</hi> when <hi>Vadus</hi> was Procurator, and of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
the <hi>Gaulanite;</hi> which two last, some think, are
not the <hi>Theudas</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> spoken of by <hi>Gamaliel,</hi>
Acts 5. 36, 37. but others are of Opinion that
these are the same with them, only that <hi>Iosephus</hi>
mistakes a <hi>Gaulanite</hi> for a <hi>Galilean,</hi> and is also mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in the time, for he saith <hi>Iudas</hi> was in the
the Reign of <hi>Archelaus.</hi> If so this Impostor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be meant in this <hi>24th</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> But I
will not stand now to dispute whether there were
two <hi>Iudasses</hi> and two <hi>Theudasses,</hi> or whether St.
<hi>Luke</hi>'s and <hi>Iosephus's Iudas</hi> and <hi>Theudas</hi> are the
same. It is sufficient for my purpose, that
these and other <hi>Seducers</hi> and <hi>Disturbers</hi> arose,
and stirred up the People to Sedition, and drew
many after them in expectation of the Messias's
coming, and partly pretended that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
were He. So it was after the Destruction
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> there rose up <hi>Ionathas Barchochebas;</hi>
who being the most famous of those Impostors is
taken notice of by<note n="*" place="bottom">De bello Jud. lib. 7. c. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus</hi> and others, as a great
Ring-leader of the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Adrian</hi>'s time. He
confidently profess'd himself the Messias, applying
<hi>Baalams</hi> Prophecy to himself, <hi>Num. 24. 17. A
Star shall rise out of</hi> Jacob: His name <hi>Barchochab,</hi>
                        <pb n="396" facs="tcp:46315:207"/>
which signifies the Son of a Star, being not a little
serviceable to this Imposture. He prevail'd on a
great number of People to adhere to him by his
inviting Promises, and perswading them he was
to be their Deliverer. Yea, he brought over a
great part of the Learned'st <hi>Iews</hi> to him, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>Iudea,</hi> but in <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> but he and
his Party being vanquished by the Emperor, the
<hi>Iews</hi> no longer call'd him <hi>Barchochab,</hi> but chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his name into <hi>Barchozab</hi> the Son of a Lye, a
false Prophet, a lying Impostor. Divers others in
those days took upon them the name of <hi>Messias,</hi>
and said they were to restore the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation,
and to that end led People after them into the
<hi>Deserts,</hi> for in such places the pretended Prophets
and Leaders drew up their forces as the fittest ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desvouz
for them, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> faith in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
which gives an Account of our Saviour's
words in this Chapter, <hi>vers. 26. If they shall say
unto you, behold he is in the Wilderness, go not forth
to them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, <hi>Wars and rumours of Wars</hi> are fore-told
to be the fore-runners and attendants of that fatal
time which should befall <hi>Ierusalem, v.</hi> 6. Of this
we have plentiful mention in the <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>

when <hi>Caius</hi> threatned the <hi>Iews,</hi> and offered to

the <hi>Iews,</hi> both in <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Iudea</hi>
were at that time. There were <hi>actual Wars</hi>

and an open War followed that Rebellion, which
was the first occasion of their final Overthrow by
the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, who came soon after, and

                        <hi>Luke</hi> words it) are to be

                        <hi>Iosephus</hi> and other <hi>Iewish</hi> Records of those

Besides the fury of these <hi>Zealots,</hi> (these <hi>Iewish</hi>

Quarrels and Ravages caused by the <hi>Factious,</hi> there
were also Foreign Assaults and Invasions from

now to be said is this, that if any Man consults the

Those horrible Earthquakes which were felt, and

of the neighboring People. It follows <hi>v 9. Then
shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you;

There is abundant testimony given to this by <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,

of <hi>Ierusalems</hi> Destruction. Thus the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fourth
of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the other parallel
Chapter in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> which treat of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
of <hi>Ierusalems</hi> Destruction, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
it self may be particularly made good
out of mere <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers, who knew nothing
of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Predictions concerning it. But not
only of these, but of all the other strange Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions,
Voices, and portentous Events<note n="†" place="bottom">De bello Jud. l. 7. c. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus</hi>
gives us a particular Account in an intire Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on this Subject. There you will find that
the Prognosticks of <hi>Ierusalems</hi> Destruction, the
Signs and Tokens in Heaven or Earth, which
the <hi>Evangelists</hi> speak of, are faithfully Recorded
by that Jewish Historian.</p>
                     <p>I have yet another Evidence to exhibit, and
that is concerning Christ's Followers and Servants
in the Age next after him; whence it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
from the Relation given by a professed
<hi>Heathen</hi> what the <hi>Christians</hi> were. And by a fair
and rational Deduction, we may gather what
manner of Persons they were at the very first,
and consequently that the Evangelical History re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
them aright.<note n="‖" place="bottom">Lib. 10. Epist. 97.</note> 
                        <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:46315:211"/>
to <hi>Trajan,</hi> gives an account of the Religion
and Practise of these Persons; for he being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consul
of <hi>Bithynia</hi> in that Emperors time, and
appointed by him to inspect the carriage of the
Christians, he was careful to inform himself of
that matter, thereby to gratifie his Master who
had employ'd him. Accordingly he tells how
strangely that Religion increased and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
strength every day in that Province, and
that not only great Cities, but Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
were filled with the Professors of it, and
in proportion to this, that the <hi>Pagan</hi> Worship
daily decreased. He testifies how resolute and
constant they were in their Profession, for he
saith he had some Persons before him under
Examination, who were accused of being Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of <hi>Christ,</hi> but he presently found them
to be no <hi>Christians,</hi> because they were so ready
upon his Suggestion to adore the Emperors Image,
and even to curse Christ himself. Which was
a sufficient Evidence to him, he saith, that they
were not<note n="*" place="bottom">Revera Christiani.</note> 
                        <hi>Christians indeed;</hi> for he had been
imformed, (he tells the Emperor) that Persons
of that Character could not possibly be forced
to any thing of that nature, but that they were
immoveable and unshaken in their Religion.
Lastly, he gives some account from their own
Mouths and Confessions of their way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and how devoutly they served God, and
that they worship'd <hi>Christ</hi> as such. Then there
is also <hi>Trajan's Rescript</hi> to <hi>Pliny</hi> concerning the
Christians, wherein he expresses it to be his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
that these Persons should no longer be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Inquisition, <hi>i. e.</hi> they shall not be sought
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:46315:211"/>
for to be punished, notwithstanding their sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness
and <hi>Pervicaciousness</hi> (as <hi>Pliny</hi> had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it) in their Religion; for he was satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of their good moral Qualities, and that they
were neither perjur'd Persons, nor Sacrilegious,
nor Adulterers, nor Homicides, nor Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of any sort. This Character and Account
which were given at the beginning of the Second
Century by the Emperor himself, and by <hi>Pliny,</hi>
who had certain knowledge of the <hi>Christians,</hi>
may create a Perswasion in us that they were
at first the same holy and Innocent Persons, and
that their Religion wonderfully increased and
flourish'd, and that all the Severities which were
used towards them, were not able either to sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle
them or their Religion, and consequently
may assure us that the History of the <hi>New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
rightly and truly describes them, and gives
a faithful Account of Christianity, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it. After this ample Testimony, it
would be needless to insist on what<note n="*" place="bottom">In Epictet. l. 4. c. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Arrianus</hi>
and<note n="†" place="bottom">De different. puls. lib. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Galen,</hi> and several other credible Writers have
deliver'd concerning the manisold Sufferings of
the first Christians; and that invincible Patience,
Resolution and Constancy, wherewith they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent
them.</p>
                     <p>After all that hath been said, I will conclude
with the Testimony of that Arch Infidel <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi>
who hath these express words in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi>
                        <note n="‖" place="bottom">Azoar. 1.</note>

a Priest, who writ about forty Years after, and

We have the <hi>Talmudick Doctors and Writers,</hi> some

we have their noted Historians, Philosophers

time) in his natural History; <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi>
a famous <hi>Roman</hi> Orator and Historian, in his

of <hi>Apollo Pythius,</hi> loved by <hi>Trajan,</hi> and made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul

in his Dialogues, (all which four flourish'd in

of which lived in <hi>Adrian</hi>'s time, whose Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary

                     <p>These things need not to have been insisted
on, or so much as mention'd, if some Ill-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Men, who pretend to knowledge in History,
had not question'd several Relations in the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament,</hi>
because they say they are not to be
found in the History either of <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Iews-</hi>
To obviate the Cavils of these Men, I designed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undertook to shew you the Concurrence of
Scripture and Heathen Authors, to discover the
Harmony between the History of the Gospel, and
the Accounts which are given us in Jewish Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
In these you may meet with the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
Passages which you read in the Books
of the <hi>New-Testament, viz.</hi> The Tax in <hi>Augustus</hi>'s
time, the appearing of the Star. <hi>Herod</hi>'s putting
to death the young Children at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the
Account of our Saviour's Persons, Life, Actions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which have been particularly insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I have shew'd you that all these memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
things are related by the Enemies of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
as well as by the Evangelists and Apostles
themselves, who had so great love of it.</p>
                     <p>But here it may be <hi>Objected</hi> thus, granting that
these remarkable Passages related in the <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament,</hi>
are mentioned in Pagan and Jewish
Historians, yet others as remarkable are not.
Now, if there were such things, and if they were
publickly known, What was the reason they were
not recorded by those who made it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to transmit such Occurrences to Posterity?
Why do not the <hi>Pagan</hi> Historians of that Age
mention Christ's and the Apostles Miracles, and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:46315:214"/>
all the great and notable things mention'd in the
<hi>New-Testament?</hi> This very thing disparageth the
Evangelical Records, and causeth us to suspect
that they are fabulous: for if they were not, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Historians, yea, all the Historians of those
Times would make mention of them, as well as
the Evangelists do. I will stifle this cavelling <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
by offering these following things to your
Consideration, which will fully satisfie you, that
there is no ground at all for this which they alledge.</p>
                     <p>I. This is to be considered, that from the time
soon after Christ's Nativity, till the Eighth Year
of his Age, there could be no History expected
concerning him, for he was all that time in <hi>Egypt;</hi>
therefore you have not one word of him, for
all that space of time, in the four Evangelists.
And if these say nothing of him, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to expect that other Historians should. When
he returned into <hi>Iudea,</hi> he lived retired from
that time till he was Thirty Years old; only
it is said that he went to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and disputed in the Temple with the
Doctors; and then presently he came home to
<hi>Nazareth,</hi> and there lived obscurely. Here was
no matter for History thus far. And afterwards
he was but three Years and a half employed
in Action, so that 'tis no wonder the Pagan
and Jewish Writers could afford to say but little
of our Saviou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and his Doings, there being so
great a part of his Life spent in privacy.</p>
                     <p>2. You must remember this, that there are
many considerable Things and Persons, (besides
those we have been speaking of) which some
chief Historians among the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi>
take no notice of; therefore you are not to marvel
that some of those things before mentioned are
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:46315:214"/>
not spoken of by them. That Obscurity of the
Sun at <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s death, which lasted a whole
Year, is not recorded by any but <hi>Ovid, Virgil,</hi>
and <hi>Pliny;</hi> yet ten Historians or more in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Age wrote <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Life, and gave an Account
of his fatal End, and of several things that followed.
The like Prodigy <hi>Ced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>enus</hi> reports to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s time; but there were almost
twenty considerable Writers from <hi>Iustinian</hi>'s time
till <hi>Ced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>enus</hi> that mention no such thing. Or,
if these Examples be not Authentick (as truly
I cannot say much for them) I will produce
those that are so in all Mens Judgments. You
may observe, that those Writers who have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
to compile all the laudable things and
Manners of divers Nations, and have even prais'd
the <hi>Brachmans</hi> and <hi>Gymnosophists,</hi> and ransack'd
the most remote parts of the World, for things
excellent and observeable, yet have said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the <hi>Essenes,</hi> who far out-did all of them,
and were in the face of the World, most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and conspicuous. Neither <hi>Strabo,</hi> nor <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi>
nor <hi>Iustin,</hi> nor <hi>Aristaeas,</hi> who have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
spoken of the <hi>Iews,</hi> say any thing of
these. Nay, <hi>Iosephus a Iew,</hi> and who, in his
two Books against <hi>Apion</hi> hath heaped up all that
is Great and Noble of that Nation, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
there (though, as you shall hear anon,
he hath something in his other Writings) of
this famous Sect of Philosophers among them;
shall we therefore be quarrelsome, and deny
there were <hi>Essenes</hi> before or in Christ's time?
Again, I could observe to you that the <hi>Romans</hi>
are not so much as mentioned either by <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi>
or <hi>Thucydides,</hi> or any other <hi>Greek</hi> Writers
of that time, though they were in the same
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:46315:215"/>
quarter of the World, and growing great and
formidable. It is somewhat strange, but is very
true, and is taken notice of by <hi>Iosephus</hi> against
<hi>Apion,</hi> though this Author (as you have heard)
was himself desective in the like case. <hi>Suetonius</hi>
writ the Lives of the first twelve <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors;
yet if you compare his Relations with the
things set down in others, you will find, that
he hath pass'd by many considerable things, he
hath omitted sundry matters which were very
obvious. Let us apply this to our present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
What if none of the Heathen Historians,
who have related the <hi>Roman</hi> Acts, had spoken of
that famous <hi>Census</hi> or <hi>Tax</hi> in <hi>Augustus</hi>'s time?
What though the <hi>Eclipse at Christ's Passion</hi> had
not been taken notice of by Historians? (though
both this and the other are recorded) yet it
would not have followed thence that there were
no such things; for you see 'tis not unusual with
Historians to pass by some Persons and Things
which are very remarkable, and worth record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
If then, some matters spoken of by the
Evangelists be not mentioned in other Histories,
we cannot with any Reason thence conclude
that the Evangelists recorded that which is false.
No such thing can be inferr'd, for even among
<hi>Pagan</hi> Writers there are many peculiar historical

none else speak of. <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Valerius Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
and others, have Narrations which are not
to be found in any others, and yet they are
not suspected of falshood. Why then may we
not credit those things which the <hi>New Testament</hi>
Records, although no <hi>Gent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>le</hi> Historians say a
word of them? Nay, we have observed this
before of the Evangelical Historians themselves,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:46315:215"/>
that they do not all Record the same things.
Though all of them mention some Passages, yet
there are others which are spoken of only by
one or two of the Evangelists; and there are
some Things or Persons which none of them
make mention of, and yet they are as remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as some of those which they have committed
to Writing. Thus the Gospels speak of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi>
and <hi>Sadducees,</hi> yea, of the <hi>Galileans</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodians,</hi>
and yet say not a word of the <hi>Essenes,</hi> who
were a considerable Sect, as was noted before.
We are not to be troubled then that some things
occur in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which are not to
be met with in very approved Authors. No Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
Sacred or Prophane, relates every thing.
The Evangelists themselves pretend not to this,
you must not expect all Christ's doings in their
Writings, for one of them, who wrote last of
all, closeth his Gospel thus,<note n="*" place="bottom">John 21. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>There are many other

                     <p>3. We are to know this, that both Jewish
and Pagan Historians concealed or misrepresent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
some things which relate to Christianity,
and that willfully and out of design. I begin
with the first sort of Historians, and offer this
Instance; we read in <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Iosephus</hi> the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

Order, Life and Institution. For this Reason
this Author is numbred by that Father among
the <hi>Ecclesiastical Writers,</hi> namely because he hath
left an Encomium of these <hi>Christians,</hi> who lived
thus religiously under St. <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangelist.
<note n="†" place="bottom">Eccles. Hist. l. 2. c. 16.</note>

some others of the Fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Baronius</hi> holds they
were old Christian Monks, and a great number
of <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers agree in this, that they were
devout Christians bred up as Disciples under
that holy Man. This is the more credible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is said of them that they used no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices;
this plainly shews they were no <hi>Iews</hi>
as to their Religion, although <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
were willing to represent them as such, in
honour of their Nation, they being so much
admired for the Piety and In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>egrity of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations.
And the rest of the Character is a
plain Description of the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> as
they are represented in the History of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:46315:217"/>
                        <hi>i. e.</hi> as having for a time all things Common, as
being Exemplary for their brotherly Love, as
Persons of singular Moderation and Self-denial,
as those who were bid not to Swear at all, as
those who underwent the severest Persecutions
with an undaunted Courage and Fortitude, and
<hi>resisted</hi> even <hi>unto Blood, and loved not their Lives
unto the Death.</hi> Now the Jewish Writers for
Politick Ends, would not give this Account of
them as <hi>Christians,</hi> but as <hi>Iews,</hi> that the Credit
of it might not redound to Christianity, but
to their Own Religion and way of Worship.</p>
                     <p>Then, for <hi>Pagan</hi> Historians, they also out of
Design omit some things, and insert others that
are very false. Thus, as<note n="*" place="bottom">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

would not insert that into his Writings which

were to be as little plausible as could be among

it is probable the Heathen Writers neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to record this so prodigious an Accident, it
making for a new Religion contrary to their

which is this, when <hi>M. Aurelius Antoninus</hi>'s Army

was in great streights, and wanted Water, they

<hi>Christian</hi> Soldiers by their Prayers procured this
extraordinary and unexpected Rain for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief

of this would have been too great an
Honour to the <hi>Christians,</hi> and to their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

Historians out of Policy would not ascribe this
Wonder to the Prayers of the Christians, but
to those of the Emperor, and tell us the very
words he used. But they have not wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
the Truth, for (as you have heard) they
impute this wonderful Accident partly to the
Inchantments of the <hi>Iewish Magicians.</hi> We know
how common a thing it is with the <hi>Pagan</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to mistake <hi>Iews</hi> for <hi>Christians,</hi> and so the
<hi>Iewish Magicians</hi> here are no other than the
<hi>Christians</hi> in that Army, who because they brought
to pass such a wonderful and astonishing Thing,
are said to be Inchanters and Magicians. These
religious pious <hi>Christians</hi> were employ'd in the
Expedition against the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Sarmatians,</hi>
and when the Army was ready to perish with

mentioned by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as a thing every where

tells them there that the Emperor's own Letter to

acknowledged the same, <hi>viz,</hi> that God
wrought a Miracle for the sake of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

                        </gap>ee any reason to
disbelieve this ancient Author; for why may
not a Name be given on different accounts? Why
may it not be call'd the <hi>Thundering Legion,</hi> for
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:46315:218"/>
this reason which he mentions as well as for that
which others Assign? I don't perceive that
these are inconsistent. <hi>Eusebius</hi> goes on, and
adds that the Emperor hereupon recall'd his
Edicts against the Christians, and by a new
Decree appointed a severe Punishment to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on the Accusers of them. The <hi>Gentile</hi>
Historians say nothing of this, and will not let
us know that that miraculous Event was by means
of the Christians. A Victory gain'd by the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Christians would sound ill. This would
have been too signal a Testimony of the Truth
and Prevalency of Christianity, therefore it is
suppressed. For the same reason you may rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
Christ's Mriacles are omitted in <hi>Pagan</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
if you suppose they came to their Ears.
It is their cunning to write nothing of these,
for hereby they would at the same time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
Christianity, and disparage their own Way.
Besides, some of them were affraid to own
the miraculous Acts of Christ and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
for they saw that this sort of Men were
persecuted and put to death; so that they da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not relate the Wonders they did, lest they
should be suspected to favour Christianity, and
by that means become liable to Capital Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Or, if they fear'd not this, yet they
were affraid to displease the great ones, as I
said before. If they knew any thing would be
ungrateful and unacceptable to their Masters
they pass'd it by. Thus when it was given out
by the <hi>Sibylline Oracle</hi> in the Year before our
Saviour was born, that <hi>Nature did then bring
forth a King to the World,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate
thereupon ordered that no Child born that Year
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:46315:219"/>
should be brought up, as appears in<note n="*" place="bottom">In Octavio cap. 49.</note> 
                        <hi>Suetoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
Which was sufficient to give check to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Historians, and so 'tis not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
(as the<note n="†" place="bottom">De Orac. Sibyll.</note> Learned <hi>Vossius</hi> observes) that
<hi>the killing of the Children of Bethlehem</hi> by <hi>Herod's</hi>
command is not mention'd by any but the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists,
he might have said, unless by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobius;</hi>
that act of his being somewhat a-kin to
the Edict of the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate.</p>
                     <p>4. I adjoin this, that the Christian Religion,
and the Professors of it, were generally look'd
upon by Prophane Writers as very contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
so that some of these scorn'd to record
those things which had any relation to them.
Hence it is that Christ's Miracles, and other things
appertaining to Christianity, are not so much
as mention'd. They would not vouchsafe to
record such mean sorry things, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
some of them took for Fables and mere
Falsities. On this account likewise it cannot
be expected that the <hi>Roman History</hi> should at any
time particularize the Christian Affairs, unless
when War and Tumults suppos'd by them to
be caused by the Christians invited those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to it. Then the <hi>Roman</hi> Glory is concern'd
to let the Conquest be told, and to have an
Account given of the Particulars. But other
Things relating to Christianity are deemed low
and mean, and are passed over in filence, as
not of any Concern and Moment. The <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
Historians do purposely omit the Acts of
the Christians because they think them not worth
the reciting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="421" facs="tcp:46315:219"/>
5. To speak more plainly, Prejudice, Hatred
and Malice, may be assign'd also as the Causes
why some of the most remarkable Passages in
the Evangelical History are not mention'd by
Pagan or Jewish Writers. It is no wonder that
<hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> who hath made a Collection
of the memorable Acts and Sayings of other
Nations as well as <hi>Rome,</hi> and dedicated them
to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> yet hath not a word of Jewish Acts,
much less hath inserted any Christian ones. His
Aversness to the Christian Religion may solve
this very well, unless you will say that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
was but just risen at that time when he
wrote, and the materials of History concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it were not yet brought to him. But this
cannot be said of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who lived in the next
Age, and who was a great Hater of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,

                        <hi>Pervicacia &amp; inflexibilis obstinatio</hi>) would not
permit them to speak what they knew of them.
<hi>Plutarch,</hi> of all that lived and writ about that

think he was almost a Christian, and had a
favour for their Religion. But the rest (some
of whom I have named before) hated the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
yea their very name was odious to them;
hence when they speak of Christians or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
they mingle Calumni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s and Lies with
what they say. Christians with them pass for
fond and superstitious People, nay for flagiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and profligate, nay sometimes for Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Impostors and Wizards, and the most exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
sort of Persons under heaven. I might
here mention <hi>Zosimus,</hi> a fierce <hi>Pagan,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
shews it in his History when he speaks of
the Christians. Being a great Hater of these
Persons he doth upon all occasions speak ill of
them, and particularly of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great,
because he was the first Emperor that threw off
Heatheanism, and imbraced Christianity. He
tells us that he Murder'd his Empress, his Son,
and other near Relations, and that he was
smitten with Leprosie for these unnatural and
horrid Crimes; in brief, he relates the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of this great Man's Life contrary to all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Historians that have written concerning
him. The ground of which was no other than
this, that he had entertain'd a particular Grudge
and Prejudi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e against the Emperor, and bore a
hatred to Christianity it self; so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he wrote concerning them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>avor'd, of ill
will and malice. It is not then to be marvell'd
at, that such Men mis-represent many Passages
which relate to the Professors of Christianity,
and fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="423" facs="tcp:46315:220"/>
can by no means speak well of a People that
they hate. A Religion that they so abhor can
have no Persons Good of it, they think. You
must not expect they will relate Truths which
they have a dislike of. This is one reason why
<hi>Pagans</hi> are def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ctive in their Historical Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
why many things spoken of by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists,
are not mention'd by them, or are
vilely mis-represented. This is the cause why
so few of Christ's Actions, and the Affairs of
Christians are taken notice of; and why thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
that are, are so miserably perverted. Prejudice
and Envy, Spl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en and Malice, are the Source
of this Miscarriage.</p>
                     <p>6. I add this, that many pieces of History are
lost, as hath been acknowledged and complain'd
of by the Learned; whence it is that many Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
which we meet with in the History
of the Gospel are not to be found in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Pagans. We have but a few of these
left us in comparison of their number at first; and
those that we have are but Relicks of those Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
before written. Particularly the Stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
Acts of our Saviour, and the Monuments
of the bravest and noblest things done in that
Age wherein He was born are now missing.
All <hi>Dio</hi>'s History from the Consulships of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistius</hi>
and <hi>Balbus</hi> unto the Consulships of <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sala</hi>
and <hi>Cinna,</hi> that is, for the space of Ten
Years, Five Years before Christ's Birth, and
Five after it, is quite lost, and so is <hi>Livy</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
of that time. In vain therefore doth any
Man think to find the remarkable Passages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
to Christ's Birth in these Writers; much
more vain is it to look for these things in those
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:46315:221"/>
Writers whose Histories are altogether missing
at this day. Thus to instance only in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which makes the greatest noise
with the <hi>Objectors,</hi> that without doubt was set
down by some <hi>Roman Historians,</hi> but their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
either by Negligence, or by Fire, or by
the Invasion of the Barbarous Nations into <hi>Italy,</hi>
or by age and length of time are lost. It is clear
that some did make mention of it; otherwise
whence had<note n="*" place="bottom">In verbo [<gap reason="foreign">

approve the loss of these, that holy Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
might be partly imbraced by Faith, and
not owe its Authority wholly to Human Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
But such as is remaining I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and that is enough to satisfie any sober
any confiderate Person.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, I remark this in the close of all, that
there are two of the most celebrated <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians
from whom we can expect nothing
that hath Relation to Christ's Birth, or any great
Occurrence that happened about that time.
For <hi>Livy</hi> wrote but to <hi>Augustus</hi>'s beginning,
which was before Christ, and for that reason
no Man can rationally think, that such Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Concomitants of our Saviour's Nativity as
the <hi>General Taxing,</hi> and the <hi>Appearing of the Star,</hi>
could be recorded by this Historian. And as
for <hi>Tacitus</hi> (who is the other Celebrated Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian)
there is as little reason to expect any
of these notorious Matters in his Writings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he goes not back so far as <hi>Augustus.</hi> His
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:46315:221"/>
                        <hi>Annals</hi> begin with <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and continue to the
death of <hi>Nero:</hi> and his Books of <hi>History</hi> begin
where his <hi>Annals</hi> left off, and go on to the end
of <hi>Titus Vespasian</hi>'s Expedition against the <hi>Iews,</hi>
and there have their Period. <hi>L. Florus</hi> is but an
Abbreviator of <hi>Livy,</hi> and therefore we can look
for nothing there. So <hi>Velleius Paterculus,</hi> though
he goes something farther, is an Epitomizer, a
Scantling of an Historian. As for <hi>Iustin,</hi> who
flourished in the Emperor <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi>'s time,
he was but an Epitomizer of <hi>Trogus Pompeius,</hi>
and goes no farther than he went; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we cannot expect any thing of him
concerning the Christian Affairs. Thus you
see what are the boundaries of these <hi>Chief Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,</hi>
and what you may look for (or rather
not look for) from them, and also you have
the Reasons given you why but few things which
have reference to the History of the Gospel are
found recorded in <hi>Pagan</hi> Writers. But all that
could be rationally look'd for, is recorded, as I
have shew'd you, by the best Historians among
the <hi>Pagans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These are the several Considerations which I
undertook to offer, and I question not but that
they will fully satisfie the <hi>Scruples</hi> and <hi>Objections</hi>
before started, and abundantly clear up this
Truth to us, that we have sufficient Testimony
from <hi>Pagan</hi> and <hi>Iewish</hi> Writers concerning the
Gospel-History. This Proposition is evident,
that the <hi>New-Testament</hi> is confirmed by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Writers, that the Evangelical Records are
attested by the authority even of those <hi>who were
without.</hi> These have transmitted to us many of
those things which are registred by the holy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:46315:222"/>
The Memoirs of these things are
in Prophane Story, in the Writings of those that
opposed the Christian Religion.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have finish'd what I attempted, that
is, I have proved the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the
Scriptures from the suffrage and attestation of
<hi>Strangers.</hi> I have let you see that the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of our <hi>Adversaries</hi> agrees with that of our
best Friends. We appeal to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and to
the <hi>Gentile-World;</hi> even these bear witness to the
Sacred Writings. And their witness cannot be
rejected by any reasonable Person, because<note n="*" place="bottom">

and to derive a Repute upon my

of the most <hi>Eminent Fathers</hi> of the Church
in those Days, as You have the Honour
to be now in these. And Your Strict Life
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:46315:227"/>
would have entituled You a <hi>Saint.</hi> You do
all the Parts of an Excellent Man, and a
Christian Bishop: You perform Great
and Worthy things Your self, and You
countenance even the lower and meaner
Attempts of others. In a word, all that
are intelligent proclaim You the Chief
Glory of our English Prelacy.</p>
                        <p>My Lord, I do not apprehend that
this can offend You, for He that is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
Vertuous and Learned, provokes
the World to speak his Worth: and they
would be infinitely blameable if they
robb'd him of his due Praise. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

their Patrons they will not praise them,
lest they should offend their Modesty. I
would not dedicate my Labours (as
mean as they are) to a Person of a mean
Figure in the Learned World, or in the
Accounts of the Religious. For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of the Dedication is to let the World

he is one that ought to be extremely

yet, my Lord, You see I do not enter on
the Task of Enlarging on Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's
Praises: the Reason is not because
it is unlawful or unfit, but because it is
too Great for me.</p>
                        <p>Not to give Your Lordship any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Trouble, if I have offended by this
repeated Presumption, I have this to
plead in my Excuse, that Your Merits as

me Criminal. And seeing my Fault
bears the Name of Duty, I despair not

till, it may be, I shall be thought by some to run
into another Extream. But I shall not consult
or attend to the Opinion of a few prejudiced or
envious Folks, but go on with my Work which I
design'd. And if it be said that some of the
Texts, and Other Subjects which I discourse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have been often treated of by others, my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is, that I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

pursuit of this I had sufficient Warrant to break
out of my Retirement, to appear bare-faced, and
to salute the Publick. Besides, I thought my

the spending of my Time, and to let it be seen

had proceeded as well as it begun, if Books of vse
and Worth only had been handed into the World
by it. But it is to be lamented that there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Vse too often made of this Invention,
whilst too many Men that are Masters of no other
Conceptions than those that are flat and useless,
or else erroneous and pernicious, take the Pains
to let the World know as much in Print. Others
scribble to satisfy a certain Itch of Writing that
they have got; and the Press seldom cures the
Distemper, but rather increases it. Other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary
Souls make their Pens wag for Bread,
and they may generally be known by this Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that the Front belies the Fabrick, the <hi>Title</hi>
doth not tell what is in the Book, but only sets
it to sale: so that indeed it is a mere Pretence
and Shew, and stands as <hi>R. B</hi>'s Sham-name
is wont to do of late in the Title-Page. But none
of these Miscarriages have discouraged me from
appearing in Publick, and pursuing those Good
Ends I before mentioned, which alone are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to legitimate the Press, and to License the
Author's Vndertakings. And if the Questio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be, Why more Books still? the Answer is made
by another Question, Why more Men still? As
long as the World increases, Writing will do so
too; for all Men are not alike, their Notions
and Conceptions are not the same; wherefore for
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:46315:229"/>
these different Readers there must be different
Books. St. <hi>Augustin's</hi> arguing of old is useful
and seasonable at this Day;<note n="*" place="bottom">Vtile est libros plures à pluribus fieri, diverso stilo, non di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versâ fide, etiam de quaestionibus iisdem; ut ad plurimos, ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>It is of great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the World,</hi> saith that Learned Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>that there should be many Books com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
by many Men, in a different Stile,
though not a different Faith, about the same
Questions and Subjects, that so hereby the
thing it self, and the Truth enquired into,
may the better be convey'd to the Readers,
to some of them in one manner, to others in
another.</hi> For this is certain, that all Persons
are not convinced and wrought upon by the same
Arguments: wherefore there is liberty to use all
kinds of Topicks. Thus the Excellent <hi>Grotius</hi>
acquaints us that he pick'd out the Best and most
Convictive Arguments (as he thought) to prove
the <hi>Truth of Religion,</hi> and particularly the
<hi>Christian;</hi> and yet some of them, as <hi>Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Fire Ordeal,</hi> &amp;c. are neglected by other
Learned Men; for Evidences work more or less,
according to the Diversity of Mens Genius's and
Dispositions. Hence the Iudicious Doctor <hi>Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>

So is it in Illustrating and Commenting upon
the Holy Text: the Diversity of Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
is requisite and useful; and it may be the
Mind of the Holy Spirit cannot be penetrated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
without these different ways of Enquiry. <hi>The
Wise Man is a Physician of the Law,</hi> say the
Iewish Doctors, <hi>i. e.</hi> whereas the Vnlearned and
Unskilful corrupt the Text, and deprave the Sense
of it, he comes and heals it by restoring it to its
genuine and proper meaning. But in effecting
this it is not necessary that he should tie himself
to the same <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Arts of Cure</hi> which
others have used before him. Some superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
confine themselves to one Man's Critical
Determination on the Place; as Bishop <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi>
saith of Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> they take a <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian</hi>
for a <hi>God.</hi> They do so in the worst
Sense, they deify <hi>Criticism,</hi> they idolize an
<hi>Expositor,</hi> and fall down to his particular <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</hi>
But we must be more Catholick and
Generous if we are desirous to have right Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of the Sacred Text, and if we would be
intim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tely acquainted with the Divine Truth
contain'd in it.</p>
                  <p>This justifies the Variety of Comments and

and this furnishes me with an Apology for thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

my self in among the Writers of the Age.
And being now of that Number, I have this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
say farther to the Reader, that though I am sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of my own Defects, and particularly of the
Miscarriages and Mistakes that may occur in this
Work, it reaching to so great a Variety of Texts
and Diversity of Matters; yet on the other
hand, I hope I shall find <hi>him</hi> as sensible of the
Arduousness of the Vndertaking, and the Lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of himself and others, to fall short in so
Weighty and Difficult a Subject. In fine, in
these and all other my Endeavours which I shall
expose to the publick View, I covet only the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the Candid and Wise; and I shall
make it my Business (I will not say to merit,
but) to purchase it.</p>

Reasons of this parabolical and mystical way
of instructing the People. The Parable of the Ten
Virgins particularly illustrated. A double historical
Sense in the 24th Chapter of St. Matthew. The
like in other Places asserted by Dr. Jackson. Whence
the peculiar and transcendent Excellency of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Writings is inferred. A just Censure of those
Writers who vilify the Letter of Scripture, and mind
nothing in it but the mystical Interpretation. Dr. Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net's
allegorizing, and at the same time ridiculing the
3d Chapter of Genesis, rebuked. The great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
of excluding the literal Sense of Scripture. The
other Extream, viz. of resting altogether in the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
meaning of the Bible, condemned. Erasmus,
Calvin, Grotius, tax'd for this. Rules to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

HAving in a former Discourse treated of
the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Sacred Writings of
the Old and New Testament, I am
now obliged (according to what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> then
undertook) to give a particular Account of their
<hi>Stile:</hi> By which (taking it in a large and extensive
Notion) I understand the <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Import</hi> of the
Holy Writ, as well as the <hi>Composition of the Words.</hi>
The <hi>Stile</hi> of Scripture comprehends the Divine
<hi>Meaning</hi> no less than the <hi>Phraseology</hi> of it. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
I will reduce all that I intend to say upon this
Subject, to these ensuing Propositions:</p>
                     <p>I. There is a <hi>mystical</hi> as well as a <hi>literal Sense</hi> of
many Passages of these inspired Writings: and we
are carefully to attend to both.</p>
                     <p>II. The Stile of Holy Scripture hath several
things in it which are according to the Phrase and
Strain of <hi>other</hi> applauded Writers: which therefore
we ought to be acquainted with, that we may the
more easily understand the sacred Penmen.</p>
                     <p>III. As there are many things in the Stile and
Composure of the Bible common to it with other
Authors, so there are some things <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:46315:233"/>
to it, which we are more especially concern'd to
take notice of, that the Singularity and Propriety
of them may be rightly understood by us.</p>
                     <p>IV. The Stile and Expression of Scripture are
such, that there are many Passages in it which are
<hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>difficult.</hi> And here a particular, but full
Account must be given of that <hi>Obscurity</hi> and <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</hi>
And likewise I shall make it my Task to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
them by a particular Explication and Illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those Texts which shall be alledged.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>first Proposition.</hi> This is to be laid down in
the first Place, that <hi>there is both a literal and a mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Sense in Scripture.</hi> The <hi>literal Sense</hi> is when the
Words are taken as they originally and properly
signify. The <hi>mystical</hi> one is when the Words are
to be understood in a more sublime Sense than the
bare Letter of them imports. This mystical or
spiritual Sense of Scripture is according to some,
threefold; 1. <hi>Tropological;</hi> when one thing deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in Scripture signifies some other thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the Conversation of Men. Thus those
Texts of the Mosaick Law, wherein is forbidden
the <hi>eating of certain Animals,</hi> have partly respect
unto the Manners of Persons. Both Jewish and
Christian Expositors have thought that it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
in those Prohibitions, that some moral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
should be taught that People from the
Consideration of the natural Inclinations and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
of those Creatures. 2. There is an <hi>Allegori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Sense,</hi> when things spoken of in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are Figures of something in the New: or,
when particularly they have a respect to Christ or
the Church Militant; as the <hi>Rock,</hi> and the <hi>Manna</hi>
mentioned in <hi>Moses</hi>'s History of the Israelites.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46315:234"/>
3. An <hi>Anagogical Sense</hi> is said to be in some Places of
Scripture; and this is when the things related are
applicable to the Church Triumphant, or the Life
everlasting: Thus the entring into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and
the Holy of Holies in the Temple, in the highest
Sense of them, are meant of Heaven and the State of
Eternal Happiness. But because there is a great quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
about the applying of this triple Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the several Passages in Scripture, which are
said to bear a mystical meaning; and because some
learned Divines of the Protestant Perswasion dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow
of this Distribution of the <hi>mystical Sense</hi> of
Scripture, I will avoid all wrangling, by assigning
only those two general Senses of Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>mystical;</hi> and by leaving it to every
one's Liberty, either to omit the particular Subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
of the latter, or to apply them as they see
occasion.</p>
                     <p>Or rather, if I may be permitted to vary from
this received Division of the <hi>Sense</hi> of Scripture, I
would divide it thus, into a <hi>primary</hi> and a <hi>secondary
Sense:</hi> the former is <hi>literal,</hi> the latter is <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ystical;</hi>
and yet not so, but that sometimes (as you shall see
afterwards) the <hi>secondary</hi> Sense is <hi>literal</hi> too: for
there are two literal or historical Meanings in some
Places; but the latter of them may be called <hi>mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
also, because it is not <hi>so plainly</hi> understood as the
other. The <hi>literal</hi> Sense of Scripture is the main,
and indeed the only Sense of the greatest part of
it: for <hi>some particular Places</hi> only have a mystical
Signification. This is the most genuine, proper
and original meaning; and therefore I call it the
<hi>first</hi> or <hi>primary</hi> one. But the mystical Sense is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivative,
improper, indirect, and not that which
was first and chiefly design'd; and therefore I call
it the <hi>secondary</hi> Sense. The former of these is that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46315:234"/>
plain meaning of Scripture which the bare Letter
and Words themselves denote to us: The latter is
when some other thing is signified in the Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what the Letter of them seems to import.
The one is obvious, and lies uppermost in the Text,
and is the soonest perceived: but the other is more
remote, and lies deep, and is not so easily discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but is of great Use and Moment, yea generally
of greater than the other more familiar and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
meaning: wherefore it is our Concern to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
our selves with it. The Bible, like that
Book in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ch. 2. 10. is <hi>written within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out:</hi>
it hath an inward, secret and mystical Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
as well as one that is external, open and
literal: and we can never arrive to a true Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of this Holy Book, unless we have some
Insight into both.</p>
                     <p>I will instance first in the Writings of the <hi>Old
Testament,</hi> and shew that there is a secondary or
mystical Sense lodged in several Passages of them.
Indeed the holy Language it self, in which these
were wrote, is big with <hi>Mysteries.</hi> I have observed
that there are more Words in this Tongue that sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
<hi>to hide</hi> or <hi>conceal,</hi> than in any other Language
whatsoever: There are a hundred synonymous
Words at least for this one thing. Whether this
Criticism have any Weight in it or no, I shall not
be much concern'd; but this is unquestionable, that
many great Mysteries are wrapp'd up in this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse
Tongue in the holy Volume. The Jews,
who were conversant in these Writings, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
there was not only a literal but a mystical
Interpretation of them, which latter they called
<note n="*" place="bottom">A <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46315:235"/>
by a diligent Inquisition. The Hebrew Doctors say
in a proverbial manner, <hi>there is not a single Letter
in the whole Law on which there do not depend great
Mountains.</hi> Their meaning is, that there are vast
Mysteries and profound Sense in every Word al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in the Sacred Writings: Which is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of another Adage of theirs, <hi>viz.</hi> that<note n="†" place="bottom">

                        </note> 
                        <hi>the
Law hath seventy Faces.</hi> It hath many various A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
different Significations and Senses: for there
are mystical as well as literal Interpretations of the
holy Text. Thus the Entrance of the Bible, the
Beginning of the Book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> though it be hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical,
and sets down Matter of Fact, as the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Creation of the Heavens and Earth, and of
Man, and the rest of the Inhabitants of this lower
World, yet it was thought by the wisest Jews, that
there was a farther Reach in it, and that both Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and Divine Mysteries were couch'd in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Particulars of that Narrative which <hi>Moses</hi> gives
there of the Origine of the World; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
this first Entrance into the Pentateuch was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>had
to be read by the Jews till they were thirty
Years of Age. It is agreed among the best Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors,
that in those Words in <hi>Gen. 3. 14, 15. The
Lord said unto the Serpent, I will put Enmity between
thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed and her Seed:</hi>
Besides the primary or literal Sense, <hi>viz.</hi> that there
shall be an irreconcilable Enmity between Mankind
and the Serpentine Brood, and that Man having an
Antipathy against that Creature, shall labour to
destroy it, by <hi>

                        <note n="‖" place="bottom">Antiqu. l. 1. c. 2.</note> gives the Sense of
this Place. Besides this (I say) there is another;
for <hi>Satan</hi> is meant by the <hi>Serpent,</hi> as well as the
Creature of that Name, (for Satan appeared in the
Shape of a Serpent, or rather actuated a living
Serpent;) and <hi>Christ</hi> is meant by <hi>the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
for he is emphatically and exclusively call'd
so, because he was not <hi>the Seed of Man,</hi> but was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an extraordinary manner born of a <hi>Virgin.</hi> So
that this Text is justly stiled, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>it is written,
viz.</hi> in <hi>Gen. 16, &amp; 21. that</hi> Abraham <hi>had two Sons,
the one by a Bond-maid, the other by a Free-woman:</hi>
This is the Letter or History. Now observe the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative
Interpretation of it; <hi>which things,</hi> saith
the Apostle, <hi>are an Allegory, for these are the two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants:</hi>
that is, these two Mothers, <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah,</hi>
denote the two Covenants, the Law and the
Gospel, <hi>the one from the Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>which gendreth
to Bondage, which is</hi> Hagar; <hi>for this</hi> Hagar <hi>is Mount</hi>
Sinai, <hi>in</hi> Arabia: that is, the Law was given on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46315:236"/>
Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and brings Servitude and strict Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances
with it; this is represented by <hi>Hagar;</hi> for
the Name of <hi>Hagar</hi> signifies the Mount where the
Law was given, and <hi>answereth to</hi> Jerusalem <hi>that now
is;</hi> that is, the present State of the Jews. The
<hi>Hagarens,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and all that spring
from <hi>Ismael,</hi> (as Historians tell us, no less than the
Apostle intimates here) are bound by their own
Laws to be circumcised, and observe therein the
Mosaical Law, like the <hi>Iews;</hi> and so they, like
<hi>Hagar</hi> their Mother, are in a servile Condition still,
<hi>are in Bondage with their Children. But</hi> Jerusalem
<hi>which is above, is free, which is the Mother of us all;</hi>
that is, <hi>Sarah</hi> (which denotes the State of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi>
that new City which Christ brought with him
from Heaven, of which all Christians are free De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizens)
is a free Woman, and signifies that we
Christians, Gentiles as well as Jews (for she is the
Mother of us all) are free from all <hi>Moses</hi>'s Rites,
and are justified without them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 22, 24, 25,
26. Thus it appears from the Apostle, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the historical Sense, there is a higher and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
in the Old Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tament, and particularly in that
Place of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where the two Mothers, <hi>Sarah
and Hagar;</hi> and the two Sons, <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi>
were designed to signify the different State of those
in the Church of God: they respect the <hi>Law</hi> and
the <hi>Gospel,</hi> the <hi>Mosaical</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Dispen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

There was this, besides the bare historical Sense.
From the same Divine Writer, we learn that the
Pillar of the <hi>Cloud,</hi> the passing through <hi>the red Sea,</hi>
the <hi>Mannah,</hi> the Drink out of the <hi>Rock,</hi> and the
<hi>Rock it self,</hi> which you read of in<note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. 13. v. 21. ch. 14. 22. ch. 16. 15. ch. 17. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Exodus,</hi> had a
spiritual meaning; and therefore some of these
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46315:236"/>
especially are expresly called <hi>spiritual: they did eat
the same spiritual Meat, and drink the same spiritual
Drink; for they drank of that spiritual Rock which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them, and that Rock was Christ.</hi> 1 Cor. 1 c. 1, 2,
3, 4. Hence it is evident that this historical Part
of the Book of <hi>Exodus</hi> is likewise symbolical, and
capable of a spiritual Construction, though still the
Truth and Reality of the History remain entire.</p>
                     <p>So what we read in <hi>Numb.</hi> 22. 9. (<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
made a Serpent of Brass, and put it upon a Pole,
that if any Man bitten with a Serpent beheld it, he might
live,</hi> i. e. be cured of the venemous Biting) hath a
secondary meaning in it, as our Saviour himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
it, namely, that <hi>the Son of Man should be
lifted up, that whosoever believeth on him should not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
but have everlasting Life,</hi> John 3. 14, 15. The
lifting up of the brazen Serpent upon a Pole in the
Wilderness, signified the lifting up of Christ upon
the Cross, for the healing and saving of all that look
up to him with an Eye of Faith. Thus when we
read that God swore (in <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 28.) that the
murmuring and unbelieving lsraelites should <hi>not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into</hi> Canaan, which the Psalmist calls their <hi>Rest,</hi>
(<hi>Psal.</hi> 95. 11.) the primary historical Sense is well
known; but besides this there is a secondary or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual one, which our Apostle hath acquainted us
with in <hi>Heb. 4. 1, &amp;c.</hi> Whence you may gather, that
in the History of the Israelites entring into the
Promised Land, and of the greatest Part of them
that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> being shut out, there is a
secondary meaning included, <hi>viz.</hi> that Believers
shall possess the <hi>Heavenly Canaan,</hi> they shall enter
into their everlasting Rest, that<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 4. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Rest which remains
to the People of God:</hi> but Unbelievers shall<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ver. 1.</note>

short</hi> not only <hi>of the Promise whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> is left of entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Rest,</hi> but the Rest it self. Thus you will find
that Place in <hi>Numbers</hi> interpreted by the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>allible
Apostle. Again, this mystical or secondary Sense
is observable in those Places in the Mosaick Law
which speak of the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Services,</hi> and <hi>Levitical
Priesthood,</hi> which the Jews were under, as you may
infer from<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. 7, 8, 9.</note> three Chapters together in the Epistle
to the Hebrews, where the Apostle applies those
things in a higher Sense (<hi>viz.</hi> to Christ himself,
and his offering himself upon the Cross) than ever
was intended by the <hi>Letter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this double Sense of Scripture is no where
more remarkable than in the Book of <hi>Psalms.</hi> The
<hi>22d</hi> Psalm, though primarily it be meant of <hi>David</hi>
when he was in great Distress, and forsaken of
God, yet secondarily, <hi>i. e.</hi> mystically it is to be
understood of our Blessed Savio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r when he was in
his Passion, and hung upon the Cross; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
you will find the first Words of it applied by
himself, <hi>Matt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thou forsaken me?</hi> And other Passages of this Psalm,
the <hi>8th, 16th, 18th</hi> Verses are taken notice of by
the Evangelist, as <hi>fulfilled</hi> at that time, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.
35, 43. Now it is certain they could not be <hi>fulfilled</hi>
unless they had been meant, in this <hi>mysterious</hi> Sense,
of <hi>Christ.</hi> The latter Part of the 16t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. Psalm is
spoken in <hi>David</hi>'s Person, and is, without do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>bt, in
the first and immediate Sense of it to be understood
of him, and of his Hopes of rising after Death to
an endless Life. But it is as clear from <hi>Acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.
25, &amp;c.</hi> that it was spoken of <hi>Christ</hi> the Son of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
and who was typified by that holy King and
Prophet; for St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith there in his Sermon to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46315:237"/>
the Jews, David <hi>speaketh concerning him, I foresa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Lord always before my Face, for he is on my right
Hand, that I should not be moved. Therefore did my
Heart rejoice, and my Tongue was glad: Moreover
also my Flesh shall rest in Hope. Because thou wilt not
leave my Soul in Hell, neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy
One to see Corruption. Thou wilt shew me the Path of
Life,</hi> &amp;c. Which are the four last Verses of that
Psalm before-named; and you may see in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Words of this Chapter, what the <hi>mystical</hi>
Interpretation of them is, according to that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
who had the Spirit to direct him to the utmost
meaning of those Words. Part of the <hi>68th</hi> Psalm,
though it be <hi>David</hi>'s Thanksgiving for the present
Mercies he received, yet undoubtedly it is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick
Praising of God for the glorious Ascension
of <hi>Christ</hi> into Heaven, as it is expounded by that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Interpreter, <hi>Ephes. 4. 8. Wherefore he saith,
When he ascended up on high, he led Captivity captive,
and gave Gifts unto Men:</hi> which refers to the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
Psalm, but is applied to Christ's Ascension by
the Apostle here. The <hi>45th</hi> Psalm is originally a
<hi>Song of Loves,</hi> an <hi>Epithalamium</hi> on the Nuptials of
King <hi>Solomon</hi> and the King of <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Daughter,
but in a remote and mystical Sense it is meant of the
Majesty and Glory of <hi>Christ's</hi> Kingdom, and the
admirable Benefits which accrue to the Church in
the Times of the Gospel. And many <hi>other Psalms</hi>
might be produced, wherein the double Sense be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned
is clearly to be discerned.</p>
                     <p>To proceed; Though the whole Book of <hi>Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
be in its literal Capacity no other than <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
Wedding-song, yet it is to be look'd upon in the
more sublime Acception of it as a Dialogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Christ</hi> and his Church, setting forth all those
divine Amours which are mutually experienc'd by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46315:238"/>
them. And that this Part of Holy Scripture, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>the Song of</hi> Solomon, is of a higher Strain than
the bare Letter imports, and that it contains great
Mysteries and Abstrusities in it, may be gathered
from that extraordinary Reverence which the
Jews paid to this Book: For<note n="*" place="bottom">Praefat. in Cantic.</note> 
                        <hi>Origen</hi> tells us, that
this (as well as the Beginning of <hi>Genesis</hi>) was not
permitted to be read by them till they had attain'd
to some Maturity of Years.</p>
                     <p>I come next to the Evangelical Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi>
who hath many things concerning Christ and his
spiritual Kingdom or Church; but it is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
that some of them in the first and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Sense, may and ought to be interpreted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
Yea, the learned <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Hammond</hi> are
of the Opinion, that that famous Prophecy in
<hi>Isa. 7. 14. Behold, a Virgin shall conceive, and bear a
Son, and shall call <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>is Name</hi> Immanuel, hath a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sense. The Words literally and primarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
a strange and wonderful Birth in those very
Days. Secondarily and mystically they are spoken
of the <hi>Messias,</hi> who was to be born miraculously of
a Virgin. Whether this Opinion be true or no,
we are certain that there is a mystical Meaning to
be added to the literal; or rather (as I said before)
it might be more expressive to say, a secondary
Meaning is added to the primary one, in sundry
Passages which we meet with, not only in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
but in <hi>Ieremia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> and <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> Concerning
the former of these the Jewish Historian hath these
Words;<note n="†" place="bottom">Antiqu. l. 10. c. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Ieremiah</hi> (saith he) <hi>in his Book, foretold
the Captivity which the Israelites were to undergo in</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,
<hi>which was just then approaching; and also the
Slaughter and Destruction which we of this Age have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46315:238"/>
seen.</hi> There was a twofold Sense, according to
this learned Writer, in some of this Prophet's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions:
Yea, there was a double literal or hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
Sense, which was the thing that I asserted
before. Whence you see I had reason to make the
Distinction of a <hi>first</hi> and a <hi>second</hi> Meaning of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
rather than of a <hi>literal</hi> and a <hi>mystical,</hi> though
I bring the <hi>mystical</hi> Meaning (when there is such an
one) under the <hi>second.</hi> As to the latter of these
Prophets, when we find him relating strange things
acted in <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Dreams,</hi> which are things only
imaginary, and represented to the Fancy, we must
not think them true in a strict literal Sense, for
they are only or most commonly done in Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and many times will not admit of a real
Performance as they are related and described:
But we are to look upon them as <hi>Enigmatical</hi> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations,
and to fix only a mystical Sense upon
them, that is, to understand them as signi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>icative
of some greater and higher thing than they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in themselves. Which may be one Reason
why, among the Jews, those that had not arrived
to some considerable Age<note n="*" place="bottom">Hieronym. Prol. in Ezek.</note> were not allowed to
read the Beginning and End of the Prophecy of
<hi>Ezekiel,</hi> in which Parts chiefly those more mystical
Visions are inserted.</p>
                     <p>I might pass to the <hi>other Prophets,</hi> and mention
some Places in which we must needs acknowledg a
secondary Meaning, as in that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 9.
27. <hi>For the overspreading of Abominations</hi> (or, with
the <hi>Wing,</hi> or<note n="†" place="bottom">Isa. 8. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Army of Abominations) he shall make
it desolate:</hi> which was meant without doubt of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>'s
desolating Armies, which were so abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to the Jews, and who, as we read,<note n="‖" place="bottom">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Macc. 1. 54.</note> 
                        <hi>set up
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46315:239"/>
the Abomination of Desolation upon the Altar.</hi> But yet
our Saviour himself, the best Expositor of the
Place, lets us know that this was meant also in a
prophetical and secondary way of the Roman Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
that sat down before <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and after a
long Siege made their way into the City and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and so might be said to <hi>stand in the holy Place:</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. 24. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>When ye shall see the Abomination of Desolation,</hi>
saith he, <hi>spoken of by</hi> Daniel <hi>the Prophet, stand in the
holy Place, then,</hi> &amp;c. It is manifest therefore that
<hi>Daniel</hi> spoke of <hi>both</hi> these destroying Armies. His
Words are to be taken in a twofold Sense, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
and secondary one: In the former they speak
of what happen'd to the Jews when <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
invaded them: In the latter they speak of what
befel them when <hi>Titus Vespasian</hi> came against them,
and destroyed their City and Nation. This is the
double Sense, and therefore you may observe what
our Saviour inserts, <hi>Whoso readeth, let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</hi>
As much as to say, when you read that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> you are to understand
something more than ordinary in it, you must take
notice of a hidden Sense in those Words: they
speak not only of what was to come to pass in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>'s,
but in <hi>Vespasian</hi>'s Reign, which was about
250 Years after. The <hi>abominable desolating Armies</hi>
of both are here meant. You see then here is a
<hi>double literal Sense;</hi> and that was the Reason why
I chose rather the Division of the Scripture-Sense
into <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>secondary,</hi> and of this latter into
<hi>historical</hi> and <hi>mystical,</hi> than that received one of
<hi>literal</hi> and <hi>mystical,</hi> because both the Sense some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
may be literal. This ought to be carefully
observed by all those who are desirous to attain to a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46315:239"/>
right Understanding of the Holy Scriptures. And
it is the want of attending to this that hath often
hindred Mens due Apprehensions of several Texts.
We see here in the Instance before us, that the
Letter of this Text in <hi>Daniel</hi> may be applied both
to the <hi>Syrian</hi> and the <hi>Roman Armies.</hi> I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
those Words in the Prophecy of <hi>Hosea, Out of</hi>
Egypt <hi>have I called my Son,</hi> ch. 11. 1. Which are
to be understood not only of the Patriarchs of old
(God's <hi>Children</hi> or <hi>Sons</hi>) being brought by God out
of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but of <hi>Christ</hi> the <hi>Son of God,</hi> call'd out
thence after the Death of <hi>Herod,</hi> Matth. 2. 15.
This Place of <hi>Hosea</hi> must be understood of both.</p>
                     <p>Hither may be referred some <hi>other Places</hi> of the
Old Testament made use of in the New, where it
is said, <hi>This was done that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by the Prophet;</hi> then <hi>was fulfilled that which
was spoken</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. 13. 35. John 15. 25, &amp;c.</note>, and the like. The Places speak not
primarily of those things which they are alledged
for, but secondarily they do, and so are truly said
to be <hi>fulfilled.</hi> I know <hi>Episcopius,</hi> and some others
before him, tell us, that these Scriptures are said
to be <hi>fulfilled</hi> when there happens something <hi>like</hi>
them, when there is a Representation or Similitude
of the things; when there may be a fair <hi>Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating</hi>
of one Event to another, then this Phrase is
used. But a judicious Writer saith well;<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Iac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                        <q>No
Prophecy can be truly said to be fulfilled only by
way of Accommodation or Allusion: for there
is no <hi>allusive Sense</hi> of Scripture distinct from the
<hi>literal</hi> and <hi>mystical</hi> ones.</q> This then is a new way
of <hi>fulfilling</hi> Predictions of the Old Testament, and
was never heard of among the antient Expositors
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46315:240"/>
of Scripture. They never dreamt of a way of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
but understood by those Words a
strict Completion of those Texts in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for it is said, they were <hi>fulfilled.</hi> But how?
Namely, there being a double Sense in those Texts,
the Evangelists take notice, and leave upon Record
that they were accomplished and fulfilled in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
or mystical Sense. And this I take to be
the true Import of the Apostle's Words, 2. <hi>Pet. 1.
20. No Prophecy of the Scripture is of any private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,</hi>
though I know there is another Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
generally given of them by those that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on these Words: But freely and impartially
scan them, and you will find this to be the genuine
Sense of them; Scripture-Prophecies are not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
according to the literal or proper Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them only; they frequently have a mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Sense: with the literal is joined a typical one,
or one literal one is added to another. This is the
secondary, and, as 'twere, the improper Sense;
but the other is the first and more <hi>proper</hi> one; for
that is the word here used, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>of

of the Text, you'll see there is Reason to translate
it thus,<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <hi>Every Prophecy of Scripture is not of proper
Interpretation; i. e.</hi> there are some Predictions that
contain a secondary as well as a primary meaning
in them: they are fulfilled according to both these,
and therefore cann't be said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>of proper Interpretation.</hi> This Exposition of the
Place is confirmed by the Reason that follows, <hi>for
the Prophecy came not of old time by the Will of Man,
but holy Men of God spake as they were moved by the
Holy Ghost;</hi> i. e. these Predictions were of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46315:240"/>
Nature, there was a deeper and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Meaning in them than is in the Writings of
Men; they are not bounded by a single Sense, and
therefore neither are they to be interpreted so.
This might be made good from several Instances
besides those a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore alledged. Many other Places
in the Old Testament might be mentioned to prove
that the same Texts are to be taken in a different
manner; that there is sometimes a double mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in them; which is plain from the Quotations in
the New Testament: for the Evangelists and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
quoting of them is a clear Proof that there is
a primary and secondary Sense of those Texts, and
that this latter is sometimes <hi>historical,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>spiritual;</hi> for we see these inspired Writers
of the New Testament take no notice of the first
literal Sense of those Places, but understand them
wholly in the secondary way.</p>
                     <p>If we look into the Books themselves of the <hi>New
Testament,</hi> we shall discover there likewise this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Meaning in several Places: Witness the many

                        <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> This was partly the

Affairs likewise in Hieroglyphick Figures: as

When they would represent <hi>Erudition</hi> or
<hi>Learning,</hi> they pictured the Heavens pouring down
<hi>Dew,</hi> which perhaps was borrowed from <hi>Moses;</hi>
Deut. 32. 2. <hi>My Doctrine shall drop as the Rain, my
Speech shall distil as the Dew:</hi> For 'tis not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the Egyptians had many of their mystical
Symbols and Expressions from the Jews, as I have
shew'd in another Place. The <hi>Parabolical Way</hi> is
not unlike to this, it conveying the Notions of
things to us by fit Representations, by apt Symbols.
And our Saviour thought good to comport with
this manner of Speech, which he knew had been in
use with the greatest Masters of Learning; and he
vouchsafed to imitate them, because he could so
innocently do it; because (as you shall hear by and
by) this was a very convenient and profitable way
of imparting Truth to them.</p>
                     <p>2. This Instructing by <hi>Parables</hi> and <hi>Allegories</hi> was
used not only by the antient Philosophers and Sages
among the Gentiles, but (as a<note n="†" place="bottom">Clem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Alexand. Strom. l. 5.</note> learned Father
hath amply shew'd) by the holy Prophets and Men
of God, and other eminent Persons among the
Jews of old. There are interspersed in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> several <hi>Parables</hi> and
Speeches which are of a <hi>Parabolical Nature,</hi> as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi>'s
<hi>Parable of the Trees that went forth on a time
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46315:242"/>
to anoixt a King over them,</hi> Judg. 9. 8. This indeed
is properly an <hi>Apologue,</hi> which in strictness of
Speaking differs from a <hi>Parable</hi> in this, that the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
is taken from a thing that is not only false
but impossible; for such is this <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, this
speaking of Trees, which is here represented. And
such is that other <hi>Apologue,</hi> viz. of <hi>the Thistle</hi>'s <hi>send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Cedar,</hi> 2 Chron. 25. 18. and an Overture
of a <hi>Marriage</hi> between them, which is mere Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a bold attributing of humane Action to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational
and sensless things. There is not a third
in all the Bible of this sort. But among the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
used of old by God's People, we may reckon
that <hi>Aenigme</hi> or <hi>Parabolical Riddle</hi> of <hi>Sampson,</hi>
which he put forth at his Marriage-Feast, <hi>Out of the
Eater came forth Meat, and out of the Strong came
forth Sweetness,</hi> Judg. 14. 14. <hi>Nathan</hi>'s <hi>Parable</hi> of
the Ewe-Lamb, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. is a very notable one,
and is famous for the admirable Effect it had. In
<hi>Isaiah</hi>'s Prophecy we read the <hi>Parable of a Vineyard,
ch. 5. 1, &amp;c.</hi> and several <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Types</hi> in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabolical
Manner. In <hi>Ieremiah</hi> we have a great
many <hi>Typical Representations</hi> and <hi>Parables,</hi> as of the
<hi>Linen Girdle,</hi> and of the <hi>Bottles filled with Wine,
ch.</hi> 13. of <hi>abstaining from Marriage,</hi> ch. 16. of a
<hi>Potter,</hi> ch. 18. of a <hi>Potter's Vessel,</hi> ch. 19. of <hi>good
and bad Figs,</hi> ch. 24. of <hi>a Cup of Wine,</hi> ch. 25. of
<hi>Bonds and Yokes,</hi> ch. 27. In <hi>Ezekiel</hi> there is the
like way of expressing great and important Truths,
<hi>viz.</hi> in a Symbolical way: There you have the
<hi>Types</hi> or <hi>Parables</hi> of a <hi>Siege,</hi> ch. 4. of a <hi>Barber's
Razor,</hi> ch. 5. of a <hi>Chain,</hi> ch. 7. of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi>
and of the <hi>Vine-tree,</hi> ch. 15. of <hi>two Eagles
and a Vine,</hi> ch. 17. of <hi>Lions Whelps taken in a Pit,</hi>
ch. 19. of a <hi>boiling Pot,</hi> ch. 24. Thus you see it
was the antient Custom of the Prophets and holy
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46315:243"/>
Men to deliver their Instructions in way of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</hi>
Yea, this was the Guise and Genius of the
Country: the <hi>Eastern</hi> People used to wrap up their
Observations on Nature and the Manners of Men
in this mystical way. Our Saviour vouchsafed to
comply with the Practice of his Countrymen, but
especially he thought fit to conform himself to the
manner of Speech and Delivery which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
used, and with which the Jews were acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Accordingly he delivered himself very often
in a figurative and mystical Stile, and uttered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
excellent divine Truths in the dark way of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. He did this sometimes to hide his heavenly
Matter from undeserving Persons, that Pearls
might not be cast before Swine, nor Evangelical
Truths be exposed to the wilful Despisers of the
Gospel. This Account our Saviour himself gives
in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 10. When the <hi>Disciptes had said unto
him, Why speakes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> thou unto them (i. e.</hi> to the <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude)
in Parables? He answered and said, Because
it is given to you to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom
of Heaven, but unto them it is not given.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 13.
<hi>Therefore speak I to them in Parables, because they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
see not; and bearing, they hear not, neither do
they understand.</hi> Some Parables which our Saviour
propounded were so dark and obscure, that none
but the refined Minds of his Disciples could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
them. Others, who had wilfully blinded
their Understandings, were not able to see into the
inward meaning of them: Yea, our blessed Lord
designed to hide his Mysteries from those profane
Persons, and therefore disguised them in these
dark Shadows.</p>
                     <p>4. This artificial and allegorical Representation
of things was to stir up our Diligence, and to make
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46315:243"/>
the Truths, when found out, more acceptable. If
all Divine Veritles were propounded in an easy
manner, so that upon the first Proposal they were
obvious to us, this would nourish our Sloth and
Idleness: but when we see that our Blessed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structor
delivers some things which can't be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
without Difficulty and Pains; this may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
us to be diligent in searching into the Mind of
God, and to use all our Indeavours to attain to a
Knowledg of it.</p>
                     <p>5. This may be assigned as another Reason why
Christ was pleased to Discourse in Parables, <hi>viz.</hi>
that what he said might be the better fixed on their
Memories; for so it is, that what comes in the
way of Story or Narrative, doth dwell longer
with Men than another sort of Discourse. As they
listen to it with greater Attention, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o generally it
makes a greater Impression upon them, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is remembred and retain'd the longer by
them: which is one singular Advantage of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things in this Parabolical manner.</p>
                     <p>6. Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ables are not only useful to fasten Divine
Truths on the Memory, but to move the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to beget in us a Delight in those excellent
Truths. For it is very entertaining and pleasant
to hear the most Heavenly Matters express'd and
set forth by those which are earthly and worldly;
because hereby at once both our Minds and our
corporeal Senses are gratisied. We are let into Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
and Spiritual Mysteries by those Objects
which are sensual and bodily: we attain to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of those things which are supernatural and
extraordinary, by a Representation of those which
are merely natural and common. This certainly
must be very delightful, and have a mighty Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
on the affectionate Part of Man: this must
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46315:244"/>
needs stir up his Desires and Love, his Joy and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
For this Reason, among others, it is
probable Christ made use of this pathetick and
winning way of Discourse: He borrowed most of
his Parables from very vulgar things, such as were
well known to his Hearers, and which they had a
very sensible notice and feeling of; that by that
Means he might work the more powerfully on
them; and by discoursing of worldly things bring
them to an affectionate liking of the things of God,
and the great Concerns of another Life: that by a
wise and artificial representing the Objects which
were daily before their Eyes, they might be able to
discern and approve of the invisible Excellencies of
a future State. Our Saviour was a very popular
Preacher; he purposely made choice of that way of
Discourse to the People, which he knew would be
most taking and moving with them: And such was
this his Preaching in Parables, which for the most
Part consisted of familiar Comparisons and Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
and set forth divine and spiritual things by
those which were bodily and sensible, yea ordinary
and vulgar, and which they daily convers'd with.
Such was his <hi>Parable of the ten Virgins,</hi> Matth 25.
1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is a plain Allusion to those things
which were common at the <hi>Iewish</hi> Marriages in
those Days: for they at that time had borrowed
many of the nuptial Rites from the <hi>Romans;</hi> as
first of all the Use of <hi>Torches</hi> and <hi>Lamps,</hi> because
they celebrated their Weddings <hi>at Night,</hi> at which
time they prepared a solemn <hi>Supper,</hi> and <hi>brought
home the Spouse,</hi> and carried her to that Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at the Bridegroom's House. Again, the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of <hi>going forth to meet the Bridegroom</hi> (which is
the most considerable Part of this Parable) was
well known at that time: The Bride-maids used to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46315:244"/>
go out with burning Lamps or Torches in their
Hands to meet the Bridegroom, and to conduct
him to the House where the Marriage was, and
from whence they came with their Lights. To
this that of the <hi>Comedian</hi> refers:

antient Date. Moreover, <hi>the tarrying of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom</hi>

and common in those Days: this happened gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
by reason of the many Solemnities that were

For this is to be remembred, that there are several
Circumstances inserted into Parables, meerly to
adorn and set off the Matter, and to make the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
and Similitude more graceful. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must not insist on every Particular, and

No; the main thing, which is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,

                     <p>There are other Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sages in the New Testament,
wherein a secondary or mystical Sense is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
as the <hi>24th</hi> Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> one
part of which, according to most Expositors, speaks
of the Forerunners of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>'s Destruction;
and the other Part of the Signs of Christ's Coming
to Judgment. But if you look narrowly into the
whole Chapter, you will observe that these Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners
and Signs of both Sorts are intermixed,
and so promiscuously placed, that it is difficult to
tell precisely which precede the Destruction of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
and which the Day of Judgment. Which
gave me this Hint first of all, that this <hi>whole</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or the <hi>greatest part</hi> of it is to be understood
(as those other Places of Scripture before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned)
in a double Sense, <hi>viz.</hi> a primary and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary.
In the former you must understand our
Saviour speaking of those Prodigies and Calamities
which should befal the Jews before the final Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of their City and Temple. In the latter
you must conceive him foretelling the dreadful
Signs and Concomitants of the last Day, wherein
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46315:247"/>
not only Jews, but all the World are concerned.
Here is a twofold Meaning of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t's Words, here

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> or <hi>historical Sense:</hi> and the latter of
them being not so obvious and evident as the other,
(and that is the Reason why it hath not been found
out) may be called the <hi>mystical</hi> Sense, for it is so
indeed in comparison of the other. Whereas then
Expositors are divided in interpreting this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
some referring some Passages in it to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastation
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and others interpreting
other Parts wholly of the Day of Judgment, we
may compromise the Matter, and reconcile the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Interpreters, by asserting, that both the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the Calamities of the
Last Day, are understood by both Parts of the
Chapter, excepting only one or two particular
Expressions, which may seem to refer altogether
to one of these. In short, the Forerunners and
Harbingers of the Ruine of the Jews, and of the
last Coming of our Saviour are the same. So that
while he speaks of one, he also foretels the other.
This shews that there is a double meaning, a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and a compound one, in the very same Words
of this Chapter.</p>
                     <p>When the Apostle in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. had spoken of the
<hi>married State,</hi> and of the Duties of <hi>Husband</hi> and
<hi>Wife,</hi> and particularly of the <hi>Love</hi> of the one, and
the <hi>Submission</hi> of the other, he tells us, in the Close,
that this Part of his Epistle hath a higher Meaning
than every ordinary Reader of it would find out:
for besides the literal Import of the Words, there
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s a more sublime and spiritual one. <hi>This is a great
Mystery,</hi> saith he, and <hi>I speak concerning Christ and
the Church,</hi> v. 32. Those Words in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 24.
mentioned immediately before, have a mystical as
well as a literal Meaning: they are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46315:247"/>
of the sacred Union of Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> and his Church,
as well as of the conjugal Union of Man and Wife.
For Marriage is an Emblem of the sacred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
Tie between Christ and Bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>evers; and
accordingly whilst the Apostle discours'd in that
Part of the Chapter concerning the Love and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of Husband and Wife, he lets us know,
that it is to be understood in a secondary Sense of
Christ's Love to his Church, and of the Church's
Subjection unto Christ. And divers other Passages
in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles have, besides their literal, a
spiritual, inward and mysterious Acception. Even
as to this the Apostle's Words are true, viz. <hi>that he
speaks the Wisdom of God in a Mystery,</hi> I Cor. 2. 7.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have abundantly proved the <hi>double Sense,</hi>
which is to be found in many Places of the Sacred
Writings; and it were easy to evin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e it from many
more Instances, if it were requisite. I will only
here in the Close produce the Words of a very

our Church, that I may not be thought to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is the very thing which I have been asserting, and
which I hope I have made sufficiently evident. The
<hi>historical</hi> Books of the Old Testament are not bare
Narratives and naked Stories of what is past, but
in the largest and most comprehensive Constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them they refer even to the Affairs of future
Times. So that what <hi>Thucydides</hi> called his History,

                        <hi>a Possession,</hi> or <hi>Treasure that was to last for ever,</hi>
a Monument to instruct all the Ages to come, we
may most truly and justly apply to the historical
Part of the Old Testament. It is of never-failing
Use to the World: Whatever is recorded here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Transactions of Divine Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Jews and other People, is typical and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative
of what God now doth, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
do to the End of the World. In the several
Particulars of the sacred Story we may read the
Condition and Lot of the Church in all succeeding
Ages; for what is to come is but a Transcript of
what we find here. And as for the <hi>Doctrinal Part,</hi>
it is mysterious and allegorical in many Places:
there is a hidden and invisible Treasure lies under
the visible and outward Letter. Many of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
Prohibitions, Threatnings and Promises
reach a great deal farther than the Words simply
and absolutely denote: and spiritual and heavenly
Matters are couched in those Texts which primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speak of earthly and temporal ones. Lastly,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46315:248"/>
when you read a <hi>prophetick</hi> Passage in the Bible, the
bare thing there literally expressed is not all that
is intended, but there is oftentimes much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.
As <hi>Ezekiel</hi> tells us of <hi>a Wheel within a Wheel;</hi>
so 'tis as true there is a Prophecy within a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the Holy Scriptures. One and the same Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
there is to be fulfilled more than once. In
short, the Bible is not like other Books: In the
<hi>History, Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Prophecies,</hi> both of the Old
and New Testament, there are secret and hidden
Meanings besides those which are plain and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and which lie uppermost in the bare Letter.
This is the peculiar and transcendent Excellency of
the inspired Writings: This one thing alone may
invite us to study this sacred Volume, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant
Labour penetrate into the inmost Sense of
it, and acquaint our selves not only with the literal
Meaning which first comes to our View, but with
that which is more remote and mysterious.</p>
                     <p>Here then we must carefully avoid these <hi>two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, viz.</hi>
of laying the Letter of Scripture aside,
and of resting altogether in the Letter. First,
some despise the Letter of Scripture, and mind no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it but the Mystery. Of this sort were the
<hi>Cabalistick Iews,</hi> who depraved the most substantial
Parts of the Old Testament, by interpreting them
in a mystical Sense only. Some of the <hi>Christian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
were too guilty of this, especially <hi>Origen,</hi> the
Prince of the <hi>Allegorists.</hi> St. <hi>Hilary</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
on St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and on the <hi>Psalms,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
several Places in this mystical way, whereby
he fastens on them a Sense very different from that
which they naturally have. Indeed his Comments
are generally taken from <hi>Origen.</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> in
his Exposition of the Scripture, is generally alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical.
<hi>Optatus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Milevi,</hi> is too often
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46315:249"/>
faulty, as to this, in his Books against the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists.
But it is to be observed, that none of these
Fathers do utterly exclude the literal and historical
Meaning. And as there have been <hi>Cabalists</hi> and
<hi>Allegorists</hi> of Old, so some high-flown Men of late
have run all the Bible into moral and mystical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations;
and in the mean time have either
disbelieved or slighted the historical and literal
Sense. I cannot wholly condemn those who have
indeavoured to present us with Mysteries in all the
several Steps of the Creation, in the whole six
Days Works, and in every particular Instance of
the Mosaick Philosophy. For this, without doubt,
is not wholly external, material and sensible, and
to be interpreted only according to the most obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Signification of the Words: it is most true
even here, that <hi>Moses hath a Vail over his Face;</hi>
and there are certain Mysteries and Allegories
contained under the very History. But though we
are not to be mere Sons of the Letter, yet we have
no Reason to think that the Mosaick Philosophy or
Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ory are made up of Allusions and Metaphors,
and are altogether mysterious. This were to soar
aloft with our modern Chymists, to dote after the
rate of a Rosy-crucian, whose Brains are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted,
that they turn all into Spectres, Dreams
and Phantasims.</p>
                     <p>But especially that Part of the Beginning of the
Book of <hi>Genesis</hi> which gives an Account of <hi>the Fall
of our first Parents,</hi> must not be turned into mere
Mystery and Allegory: for it is sufficiently evident
that <hi>Moses</hi> speaks of Matter of Fact. Wherefore

To humour these ignorant Blockheads that were

This is very strange Language from a Reverend

all died:</hi> all is mere Romance and Fiction;
there was nothing of these in Reality. And then
likewise we have as good Reason to believe that the
other Parts of the New Testament which speak of
our Saviour and all his Undertakings, are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in the same manner, that is, they are but
a cunningly devised Parable; they may have some
<hi>moral</hi> meaning, as <hi>Esop</hi>'s <hi>Fables</hi> have, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
nothing of real Fact. This is the natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of <hi>allegorizing</hi> the <hi>3d</hi> Chapter of <hi>Genesis.</hi> By
dealing thus with this Part of the Bible he hath
baffled all the rest, he hath wretchedly subverted
the whole Scheme of our Religion; he hath spoil'd
the whole Fabrick of Christianity; and he hath
made the Scripture useless and insignificant. So
that by this one Attempt of his he hath shaken, not
to say overturn'd, the Foundations of Religion, he
hath taken part with the known Despisers of all
revealed Theology; he hath encouraged and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46315:250"/>
the wild Conceits of Scepticks; he hath
strengthned the Hands of the Profane; he hath
abundantly gratified the whole Tribe of Atheists
and Deists; he hath won their Hearts for ever.
And indeed we cannot but observe what fort of
Men they are that applaud his Undertaking, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Wits of the Town (as they are call'd) Men
disposed to very ill Thoughts of Religion and the
Scriptures, yea Men generally indulging themselves
in Immorality and Debauchery. These are the
Persons that promote his Notions, and cry up his
Writings. This <hi>Theorist</hi> is become much more
pleasing to them than Mr. <hi>Hobbs.</hi> This <hi>new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeologist</hi>
is far more taking than the <hi>Leviathan,</hi>
because he nips the Bible more closely, and also
because he is not (as the other) a Layman, but a
professed Divine, and that of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
This makes his Enterprize so acceptable to
these Men; for now they have a <hi>Clergyman</hi> to
vouch them; they have the Warranty of a <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
I will not question, or so much as suspect
the Prudence of our Ecclesiastical Governors: but
in my Judgment, if there be no publick Censure
pass'd upon such a daring Attempt as this, by a
Member of our Church, Atheists will have just
Ground to laugh at our Discipline, as well as they
do at our Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>To excuse himself, he saith, this way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is used in the Writings of the <hi>New Testament,</hi>
and confessed to be <hi>Metaphorical</hi> and <hi>Symbolical;</hi> and
why not then in <hi>Genesis?</hi> I answer; Because though
there are some Expressions of that Nature, as <hi>the
Trumpet sounding,</hi> and <hi>the Books opened</hi> at the Day of
Judgment, which are but metaphorical, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
yet it is easy to discern it: And in other Places
it is intimated, and sometimes plainly declared,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46315:251"/>
that the Passages are metaphorical and my<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ical,
as in the <hi>Parables</hi> of the Prophets and of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
But it is quite anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r thing which we are
speaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> not an Expression or two, but a
whole entire History delivered in plain Words, and
with all its Circumstances as Matter of Fact; and
there is not the least Intimation of any other Sense:
yea many of the Particulars are mentioned in other
Places of the Old and New Testament, as direct
Matter of Fact. Wherefore when he attempts to
solve his Undertaking by alledging some Passages
in the New Testament of Christ and his Apostles,
he cannot but see that it is very foreign to his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Again, in a short <hi>Appendix</hi> to his Book
(where he seems to retract in a manner what he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ad said, having been informed (he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aith) that <hi>it
was displeasing to pious and wife Men</hi>) he excuses
himself by alledging the <hi>Fathers;</hi> who, 'tis true,
present us with several <hi>allegorical</hi> Interpretations
and Descants on some Places of Scripture, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
on the <hi>3d</hi> Chapter of <hi>Genesis:</hi> but this is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>othing to his purpose, because those antient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
do not deny the <hi>literal</hi> Sense, which he doth.
He is not content to allegorize that Chapter, but
he wholly rejects the literal Meaning, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
avers that <hi>Moses</hi> all along tells a Story that

                        </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persede
and lay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aside the historical Sense. And
moreover, he hath neither the <hi>Fathers</hi> nor the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi>
as an Example of <hi>ridiouling</hi> the Mosaick Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

which derides the <hi>3d</hi> Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and who
committed it to the Press for the sake of some of
the witty Folks of the Town, and to please the
Atheistical Rabble. This signal Act of avenging
Providence is well known to the World, and I
wish the ingenious <hi>Theorist</hi> would seriously reflect
upon it, and learn thence to make Sport with the
Bible no more: And I request him not to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at my plain Dealing with him; for I assure him
that I have said nothing out of any disrespect or
ill Will to his Person, but wholly from a deep Sense
of the great Mischief which is like to ensue upon
this late Attempt of his. I abhor the treating of
any learned Man's Writings with Contempt: yea,
on the contrary I have always paid a due Respect
and Deference to them, though they are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed
to the Notions which I have of things. But
when I see the Holy Scriptures struck at, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
it self shock'd and extremely hazarded, I
cannot forbear from uttering my Sentiments, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hewing my just Indignation on such an Occasion.
Christian <hi>Charity,</hi> which <hi>beareth all things, endureth
all things,</hi> cannot by any Means brook this. And
I must freely tell this learned Writer, that let his
Character otherwise be never so fair, (and 'tis not
my Design to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it is certain that the better this is, the worse is his
Enterprize; for he seems to come sober and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
to undermine the Bible, and destroy Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
as many a <hi>Cracovian</hi> Reasoner hath done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. But truly there is little <hi>Sobriety</hi> in jest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and buffooning, in jeering and drolling away
our Religion, and that under the Pretence of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophick
Antiquity.</hi> Nay, let me tell him, (and I
hope by this time his own Thoughts do so too) that
to trifle and droll after the Rate that he doth on
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46315:252"/>
the inspired History concerning <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> is a
near Approach to Blasphemy. I heartily wish he
may be apprehensive of his Delinquency in this
kind, and that for the future he may guide himself
by that wholsome Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are not to
quit the literal Interpretation in any Place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
unless there be a necessity of doing so. And
'tis certain there is none in the present Case; nay,
there is an absolute Necessity of acknowledging the
literal and historical Meaning, unless we will sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the very Foundations of our Religion. He
that makes this first Book of the Bible to be wholly
mystical, doth not observe the Distance between
<hi>Genesis</hi> and some Part of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> We must
be careful that we follow not the Masters of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse
Divinity so far, that we exclude the literal
Sense of Scripture: for this will prove fatal to the
Scriptures themselves, and to all Religion, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Christianity. If we dote upon Allegories,
and defy the Letter and History of the Bible, we
quite null these Sacred Writings, because we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
render them ambiguous and precarious, we au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
any wild Interpretations that can be made
of them. If we may leave the literal Sense of
Scripture when we please, and fly to metaphorical
and mystical ones, then the Certainty of the Word
of God will soon vanish: for then we cannot tell
what is true or what is false; or if we know it, we
can never confute any Error, or maintain any
Truth from the Holy Writ. For by this Means
the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>will be innumerable Explications of Scripture,
and who can possibly determine which of them is to
be made choice of? If you offer any Text to prove
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>uch or such a Doctrine, it will easily be evaded if
the Letter may not be our Guide; for it is but say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
The Place is not meant as the Words sound,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46315:253"/>
but must be taken figuratively and mystically. Thus
Scripture it self is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> destroyed by cashiering the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Acception of the Words. Yea, we destroy
the whole Gospel, and pluck up the Foundations of
Christianity; we deny Christ and all his blessed Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings
for our Redemption and Salvation: for
these being Matter of Fact, are founded upon the
literal Account we have of them, upon the histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Relation of them, which we have in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the Evangelists and Apostles. Thus dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and fatal it is to let go the literal Sense of
Scripture, and to catch at a mystical one only. By
this wild Practice Men attempt to thrust Religion
out of the World; or, which is the same thing,
to present us with a metaphorical and allegorical
Religion, inst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ult of the <hi>mystical Sense</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which I have been speaking of. He is truly a
<hi>Divine,</hi> he may deservedly be said to have Skill in
Christian Theology, who contents not himself with
the primary or literal Import of the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
but dives into the secondary but more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse
Meaning of them, who penetrates into the
hidden Mind of the Word of God. If there be a

                        </gap> Sense in Scripture, as I have proved in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Instances, it must be reckoned a great Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
(to say no worse) in the Expositors of this
Holy Book, not to take notice of this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but to acquiesce wholly in the literal Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
This is observable in the Expositions which
some of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> give of the Bible: for as the
Jewish <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

before) so another Set of their Doctors is too
much devoted to a literal Interpretation. This
they stick to when there is no Reason for it, yea
when the Words are plainly figurative, and must
needs be taken so. Yet even then they interpret
them according to the Letter, and thence are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
some of those foolish Propositions and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
Assertions, those groundless Fables and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends;
yea those gross Lies and Forgeries which
are found in the Books of the <hi>Rabbins. Erasmus</hi> was
faulty in this kind: his Readers may observe that
he neglected the mystical Sense of Scripture, and
resolutely adhered to the bare Letter. In which
he is followed by <hi>Calvin,</hi> who generally leaves out
the secondary and more sublime Sense of many
Texts of Scripture, and satisfies himself with the
literal one only. This he doth in his Comment on
<hi>Gen. 3. 15. I will put Enmity between,</hi> &amp;c. which he
interprets simply of the Antipathy between Men
and Serpents, (which is the poor and lank Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
which <hi>Iosephus</hi> the Jew gives of it, as you
have heard:) whereas those Words in the highest
Meaning of them (as the antientest and learnedest
Fathers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Promise of the Messias made to our first Parents,
and in them to all their Posterity. Those Places,

And <hi>ver. 18. They part my Garments among them,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46315:254"/>
and cast Lots upon my Vesture; Calvin</hi> is enclined to
interpret simply, and not concerning <hi>Christ:</hi> he
would have them to be only metaphorical Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>David</hi>'s Calamities and Sufferings, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
it is expresly said by the Evangelist St.
<hi>Matthew,</hi> that those things were done to Christ,
<hi>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
Matth. 27. 35. And by the Evangelist St. <hi>Iohn,
This was done that the Scripture should be fulfilled,</hi>
ch. 19. 36, 37. And so as to that Text, <hi>Ier. 31.
22. The Lord hath created a new thing in the Earth, a
Woman shall compass a Man.</hi> The same Author
will not have this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> (for such it is, though
it seems to speak of a thing past, it being the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of prophetick Writers to signify the future
Time by the past, as you shall hear afterwards) he
will not, I say, have this Prediction refer in the
least to Christ and the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> It is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
he saith, to understand it so. And some other
Prophecies which are meant of Christ, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands
otherwise, confining himself to the bare
Letter of the Words. Thus this excellent Person,
out of an Affectation of Novelty, perverts those
Scriptures which the antient Fathers quoted as spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of Christ; and he plainly tells us, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
abused those Places. But (which is far worse)
he refuseth to expound some of those Texts of the
Old Testament concerning Christ, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Evangelical Writers in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alledg them as punctually <hi>fulfilled</hi> in him,
and in what he suffered. For this Reason that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Man may be thought to incline to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism</hi>
or <hi>Arianism</hi> as much as <hi>Erasmus</hi> is thought
by some; for you shall find the one as well as
the other interpreting Places of Scripture,
which speak of Christ, quite to another Sense.

It was the Candour of this excellent

that when he treats of the Texts in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which speak concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> he generally
interprets them in the first and literal Sense, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Practice of all Apostolical and Antient
Expositors, who constantly search into the <hi>mystical

God, unless we indeavour to acquaint our selves
with both these, not only the historical, but the
more sublime and mystical Sense of it. Both these
jointly make up Divine Truth. Therefore that is

take away the Literal Sense to bring in the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

of the Spirit by keeping up the literal Sense.
These two must go together. If we lay aside the
former, the Scripture is no longer <hi>Scripture,</hi> i. e. a
written Law, made up of Letters: and if we lay
aside the latter, we do Despite to the Spirit of
Grace, who hath lodged a farther Meaning in the
Holy Scriptures, (which were inspired by him)
than that which is contained in the Letter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46315:255"/>
to understand the Scriptures as we should do,
we must be careful to find out the secondary or my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Interpretation of the Words, as well as the
primary or literal.</p>
                     <p>And that we may know when the Sense is of the
former, and not of the latter sort, it will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to observe these following Rules. The first is
given us by<note n="*" place="bottom">Comment. in D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <hi>R. Ben-Ezra,</hi> thus; If any Precept in
Scripture be not consonant to Reason, it must not
be taken in the simple or literal Sense, as that Place,
<hi>Circumcise the Foreskin of your Hearts,</hi> Deut. 10. 16.
We cannot suppose this to be understood literally,
because (saith he) it is so unreasonable and absurd
a thing; yea indeed it is utterly impossible, for
there is no such thing as the <hi>Praeputium</hi> of the Heart.
In these and the like Places a spiritual Sense must
be searched for, otherwise we must assert that the
Scripture enjoins us the doing of those things which
cannot be done. Besides, if we understand it lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
<hi>i. e.</hi> of the circumcising or paring off any
Part of the Heart, this is an inhumane and bloody
thing: to do this is to be cruel to our selves; yea,
'tis Self-murder: Therefore according to a <hi>second
Rule,</hi> which I am to propound, this cannot be the
Sense of the Place, and consequently the literal
Meaning is not intended here. The Rule is this,
That all Precepts or Prohibitions, which, as to their
Sound, are wholly repugnant to the Moral Law,
and the express Command of God there, contain
in them some mystical or spiritual Sense. By this
you may judg of the Meaning of those Places of
Scripture, <hi>Prov. 23. 2. Put a Knife to thy Throat, if
thou be a Man given to Appetite:</hi> And that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <hi>Matth. 5. 29, 30. If the right Eye offend thee,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:46315:256"/>
pluck it out: and if the right Hand offend thee, cut it
off.</hi> To which I may add, <hi>Prov. 25. 21. Rom. 12.
20. Heap up Coles on your Enemies Heads.</hi> When a
Person is thus commanded in Scripture, to do some
thing contrary to the express Law of God, we may
conclude that Command is to be understood in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
or mystical Sense, and not according to
the Letter. So when God bids <hi>Hosea take a Wife
of Whoredoms, and Children of Whoredoms,</hi> ch. 1. 2.
And when it is added that <hi>he went and took such an
one,</hi> ver. 3. we must look upon it as a Parable, a
mystical Saying. It was a <hi>Vision,</hi> saith St.<note n="*" place="bottom">Prooem. in Hos.</note> 
                        <hi>Ierom.</hi>
So saith <hi>Ionathan</hi> the Chaldee Paraphrast; and
<note n="†" place="bottom">Mor. Nev. l. 2. c. 46.</note> 
                        <hi>Maimonides</hi> agrees with him. It is certain that
this was done only in Shew and Representation,
but not actually and really, because it was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to that direct Prohibition in the Law, <hi>Lev. 21. 7.
Thou shalt not take a Wife that is a Whore.</hi> The Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then of the foregoing Words is this, that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this People brag that they are my People, my
Spouse, my Children; go and represent the true
State they are in by a Parable, and let them know
that they are as much my Wife and my Children,
and no more, than if you should take a professed
Whore with her spurious Brats, and say, that she
is your lawful Wife, and they are your lawful
Children, which is absolutely false. This I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
is the plain Meaning of the Words. But
that Command of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22. 2.
<hi>Take thy Son, the only Son</hi> Isaac, <hi>and offer him for a
Burnt-offering,</hi> is of another kind; for that this is
not to be understood mystically but literally, we
can prove from the History it self, which is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
that we may plainly see it was a Matter of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46315:256"/>
Fact: and it is inserted among other <hi>Historical</hi> Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
concerning that Patriarch; whereas the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
Books, such as that of <hi>Hosea,</hi> contain in
them <hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Representations</hi> of things spoken of
as really done, although they are not. Besides,
we are certain that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offering his Son <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac,</hi>
i. e. his binding him, and laying him upon
the Altar, and undertaking to kill him, were real
things, and actually performed, because we are
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>old by the infallible Penmen of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that they were so; for they alledg this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact, to prove and demonstrate the Doctrine
which they deliver, <hi>Heb. 11. 17. Iam.</hi> 2. 21.
Wherefore we are sure it was a Reality, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the Words in <hi>Genesis</hi> are to be understood
in a plain Literal Sense. A third Rule, and the
most useful, is this; See what Texts of Scripture
are already interpreted in a Mystical Sense by the
Evangelists and Apostles, and observe the Nature,
Occasion and Circumstances of those Places, and
thereby you will be able to Discern what other
Places of Scripture are to be understood in the
same manner: And accordingly you must inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
them not after the Bare Letter or History, but
in a Spiritual Sense. And so much for the first thing
which is to be taken notice of, in order to our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a right Understanding of the <hi>Stile</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>viz.</hi> that there are many Places in it that

                        <p>The Scripture in many Places speaks not accurately, but
according to the Vulgar Opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Apprehensions of
Men. Several Instances of this in the Old and New
Testament: The Phrases, Expressions and Modes
of Speaking used by the Inspired Writers, are the same
with those that we find in the best Classick Authors.
This largely proved from the Phraseology of the Old
and New Testament. More particularly the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
and Comparisons in both are alike. The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
of Scripture-Phrase with the profane Stile
shew'd by Grotius, Pricaeus, Gataker, &amp;c. There
are in the Bible the same moral Notions, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
in the very same Stile, that there are in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Writers. In both Man's Life is a Way, a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage,
a Warfare. Other Ethick Notions, viz.
that Good and Vertuous Men are Free; and that
all Vicious Persons are Slaves: that Good Men are
Wife, and all others are Fools; (to which latter the
Author reduceth John 20. 10. though generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
otherwise, and comments upon it:) that Good
Men are the Friends of God; that Vitious Men
are Dead; that Death is a Sleep. All which occur
in the Sacred Writings as well as in Pagan Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>THE</hi> Second Proposition <hi>is this, that</hi> the Stile of
the Holy Scripture hath many things in it which
are according to the usual Strain of other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Authors. <hi>Take this in these Particulars;</hi>
                     </p>

                        </gap>. The Scripture in many Places speaks not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately,
but according to the vulgar Opinion and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46315:257"/>
Apprehensions of Men. Thus it is a common Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
(but I will not balk it here) that in the
Mosaick History of the Creation of the World it
is said, <hi>God made two great Lights,</hi> Gen. 1. 16. and
<hi>the Moon</hi> is reckoned as one of them; whereas it is
not to be doubted that <hi>the Sun,</hi> but especially <hi>the
Moon,</hi> is but a <hi>little Light</hi> in comparison of some of
the <hi>Fixed Stars.</hi> But this we may truly say, with
an antient Christian Writer,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopon. in Hexaem.</note> It was not <hi>Moses</hi>'s
Purpose to act the Philosopher or Astronomer in
the Book of <hi>Genesis.</hi> But because the Sun is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to us than those Fixed Lights are, and the Moon
is much nearer than the Sun, therefore though
they be less in themselves than those Remote Stars,
yet they seem to our Sight to be the Biggest Lights
that God hath set up in the Heavens: Wherefore
they are emphatically, and by way of Eminency,
call'd in the Hebrew, <hi>the Great Lights,</hi> though the
least of the Stars be a greater Light than the Sun or
Moon. So though it is said of the Almighty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
and Preserver of the World, that <hi>he hangeth
the Earth upon nothing,</hi> Job 26. 7. which is exactly
and philosophically true; yet in another Place of
this Book we read of <hi>the Pillars of the Earth,</hi> Job 9. 6.
which is a manner of Speech adapted to the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the Vulgar, who cannot conceive how so
great and massy a Body as this Ball of Earth can
hang hovering in the Air, and be upheld without
some <hi>Props.</hi> And several other such Expressions
there are in Scripture which are spoken according
to the popular Apprehensions, and the seeming
Appearance of things, not the Exactness of the
things themselves. Therefore their Attempts have
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46315:258"/>
been to little purpose, who would force a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
out of the Bible, as if they had a mind to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
us with a Body of Philosophy <hi>jure divino.</hi> As
some Grammarians and Criticks pretend to find all
Arts and Sciences whatsoever in <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poems,
so these fond Men undertake to discover a Compleat
System of Natural Philosophy in the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
But this is a very vain Enterprize, because,
though there is a great deal of excellent Philosophy
in several Places of Holy Scripture, yet these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
were never intended mainly for this End, but
for one far higher and nobler. Hence it is that you
hear the Holy Writers speaking sometimes not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the very Nature of the things, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Appearance, and the Opinion Men
have of them. Yea, they oftentimes express them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
according to the received Opinions, although
they be erroneous and false, as in the Instance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned. <hi>Theodoret</hi> gives us the Reason of

Thus frequently in the Scripture cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Properties are attributed to God: you read
of his <hi>Face</hi> and <hi>Back-parts,</hi> Exod. 33. 23. and that
these latter were <hi>seen</hi> by <hi>Moses,</hi> which is spoken by
way of <hi>Anthropopathy,</hi> as Divines commonly speak,
<hi>i. e.</hi> after the manner of Men, in compliance with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46315:258"/>
their weak Capacities. As when a Man's <hi>Face</hi> and
<hi>Fore-parts</hi> are seen, there is a considerable Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Knowledg of his Person; but when he is seen
<hi>behind</hi> only, it is imperfectly: so was it when God
appeared to <hi>Moses,</hi> he shew'd himself to him not
fully, but in part; as when a Man turns away his
Face from another, and lets him see only his Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts.
And so in other Places of Scripture we read
of God's <hi>Eyes, Ears, Hands, Feet,</hi> and other bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Parts and Members; but we must not forget here
the old Rule of <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>

is, as spoken in a vulgar manner, and after the way
of Mortals, who when they <hi>repent,</hi> abandon their
former Doings. So when God is said to <hi>repent,</hi>
that which we are to understand by it is this, that
he acts in a contrary manner to what he did before.
As in the forementioned Places, <hi>it repented the Lord
that he made Man,</hi> the meaning is, that he purposed
to destroy Mankind, <hi>viz.</hi> with a Deluge; for so
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46315:259"/>
you find it explain'd in the next Verse, <hi>the Lord
said, I will destroy Man whom I have created.</hi> And
when 'tis said, <hi>The Lord repented that be made</hi> Saul
<hi>King;</hi> the meaning is, that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

                        </gap>osed to depose

in the Words immediately following in the next
Chapter. Therefore <hi>Theodoret</hi> saith well,<note n="*" place="bottom">

<hi>Repenting</hi> is no other than the changing of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.
And thus we are to interpret this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
where-ever it occurs in Holy Writ, (for in
many other Places God is said to <hi>repent</hi> of what he
did) as knowing that the Phrase of this Sacred
Book is oftentimes fitted to the Apprehensions and
Language of Men, and not the absolute Reality of
the thing. That of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> is certainly true,
<note n="†" place="bottom">

                           </gap>.</note> God accommodates himself sometimes to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Infirmity when he speaks in Scripture. So
those Words are to be understood in <hi>Gen. 11. 5.
The Lord came down to see the City:</hi> And again, <hi>ver. 7.
Let us go down:</hi> which are spoken in a vulgar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and with respect to the shallow Conceptions of
Mankind. And the same Expression is used in <hi>Gen.
18. 20, 21. Exod. 3. 7, 8. Psal. 144. 5. Isa.</hi> 64. 1.
God is here said <hi>to come down,</hi> which signifies God's
taking more than ordinary Notice of the Actions
of Men, and his designing to do some extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing. The Scripture calls the Angels that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to <hi>Abraham</hi> Men, because they feem'd to be
such. The Man <hi>Gabriel</hi> you read of in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 21
because he appear'd in the Shape of Man. And
so in the New Testament the Angles at our Saviour's
Sepulchre are stiled <hi>young Men,</hi> because as to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Appearance they were such. Nothwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

what some Commentators have said upon
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 15. Samuel <hi>said</hi> to Saul; and again,
<hi>ver. 16. Then said</hi> Samuel; I am fully perswaded
that those Words are spoken according to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
not the real Truth of the thing. The
Name of <hi>Samuel</hi> is given to the Devil or Spectre
that appeared, but we are not to think that <hi>Samuel</hi>
himself in Body and Soul appear'd; for 'tis ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
as well as impious to imagine that the departed
Saints are at the Command and Disposal of a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromantick
Witch, a Cursed Sorceress, a Hellish
Hag, as if she could fetch them down from the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Regions when she pleaseth. But this she
did, she raised a Spectre, or substituted some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who resembled <hi>Samuel,</hi> whom she represented
to <hi>Saul</hi>'s Sight, as if he were the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi>
indeed. Thence we read in this Sacred History,
that <hi>Samuel said to Saul,</hi> because he who appear'd
in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Likeness was thought to be <hi>Samuel,</hi> and
thought to speak to <hi>Saul.</hi> Thus a Learned Father

because <hi>Saul</hi> believed it to be the real <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el;</hi>
for the Scripture speaks frequently according
to other Mens Belief and Notions. So it usually
calls those <hi>Gods</hi> that are not really such; but because
the false and feigned Deities of the Heathens were
reputed True Gods by them, therefore the Name of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46315:260"/>
                        <hi>Gods</hi> is given them often in the Old Testament, and
sometimes in the New.</p>
                     <p>But to confine my self to this latter, here we
find several things delivered not according to the
Reality of the Matter spoken of, but according to
the Sense and Notion of others: So I understand
our Saviour's Words, <hi>Matth. 12. 5. The Priests in
the Temple profane the Sabbath, i. e.</hi> by killing of
Beasts, and doing other laborious Work, they, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to you,</hi> profane that Holy-day, according
to the Notion which you Pharisees have of keeping
and breaking the Sabbath, and according to which
you condemn me and my Disciples, as Profaners of
that Day. The Phrase used by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> ch. 1. 32.
is according to a very vulgar Conceit, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>the Sun did dip:</hi> And the same Expression is in
<hi>Luke</hi> 4. 40. for the Sun seems to dive or be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Sea when it goes down. This is the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension</hi>
of those that inhabit near the Sea. In
such a Sense as this must the Apostle be understood
when he saith, <hi>It pleased God by the Foolishness of
Preaching to save them that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 21. It
is call'd <hi>Foolishness,</hi> not as if it were really such,
but because it was commonly <hi>reputed</hi> so by those
that were not competent Judges, because (as <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoret</hi>

                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. In loc.</note> it was by Fools call'd
Foolishness. Especially it was denominated so by
those who thought themselves great Masters of
Wisdom: wherefore the Apostle explains himself
afterwards, and saith, this Preaching was <hi>to the
Greeks Foolishness,</hi> ver. 23. Nay, you read of <hi>the
Foolishness of God,</hi> ver. 25. which can be meant in
no other Sense than this, that this Excellent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of preaching the Gospel, which was of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46315:260"/>
God's own Appointment, was reckon'd as a weak
and foolish Institution by those doughty Boasters
and Pretenders to Wisdom. To them and such as
they were it seem'd to be <hi>Foolishness,</hi> but really it
was no such thing, for the Apostle calls it the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God,</hi> ver. 24. Thus the Scripture speaks
sometimes according to the Opinion of others,
though it be not true. So I apprehend those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of the Apostle are to be understood,
2 <hi>Cor. 5. 13. Whether we be besides our selves;—or
whether we be sober: i. e.</hi> we seem to our Enemies to
be <hi>besides our selves,</hi> to be distracted when we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
our selves; and then only they think us <hi>sober</hi>
when we speak submissively and in a self-denying
Stile. In the same Sense we are to take <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.
1, 16, 17. where he calls his necessary apologizing
for himself <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>speaking foolishly,</hi> not that
'twas so in it self, but because it was accounted so
by some. In another Place he calls <hi>Epimenides</hi> the
Cretian Poet<note n="*" place="bottom">Tit. 1. 12.</note> a <hi>Prophet,</hi> because he was thought
to be such an one by his Countrymen, not that he
deserv'd that Name. Here likewise you will see
that things are sometimes expressed in a popular
way, and according to the vulgar Sense and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
as when it is said, <hi>the Stars of Heaven fell unto
the Earth,</hi> Rev. 6. 13. which cannot be really and
philosophically true; for these Luminaries, by
reason of their vast Magnitude, cannot fall upon
the Earth; there is no room for them in so small a
Compass. But perhaps by the <hi>falling</hi> of these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Lights from their Stations, is meant some
Great and Notable Defection in the World, a
Mighty Confusion and Disorder; so that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick
of the Universe was as 'twere broken up and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46315:261"/>
dissolved: Or by <hi>Stars</hi> here are meant Great Men
and Magistrates, and their <hi>falling to the Earth</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
their being displaced from their high Station;
and so 'tis a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> and belongs to another Place.
And many other Passages there are which I will not
now particularly enumerate. And indeed some of
these are so common and obvious, that I should
have forborn the mentioning of them, but that it
was somewhat requisite to touch upon them, when
I am representing to you the different and various
Guises of the <hi>Scriptural Stile.</hi> It is common also in
the Writings of the Evangelists and Apostles, to
speak with reference to humane Properties and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Actions, even when God himself, and the
most Divine things are treated of. So we often
read of<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 22. 69. Col. 3. 1. Heb. 1. 3. &amp; 8. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Christ's sitting at the right Hand of God;</hi>
whereas 'tis acknowledged, that a <hi>right Hand</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
properly be attributed to God; nor can our
Saviour, in strictness of Speech, be said to <hi>sit at
God's right Hand;</hi> for then he could not be said to
<hi>stand</hi> there, <hi>Acts.</hi> 7. 56. Wherefore it is evident
that these Expressions are used only in compliance
with the common Language of Men, who generally
prefer the right Hand before the left; and <hi>to sit or
stand at one's Right Hand,</hi> denotes great Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Honour. So that when those Modes of
Speaking are applied to our Blessed Lord, the plain
Meaning is, that after all his Labours and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
he is highly dignified by God, he is exalted
to unspeakable Honour, he is advanced to such a
Glorious State wherein he is invested with absolute
Power and Soveraignty, and is able to protect, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
and reward his Church, and to confound their
most powerful and malicious Adversaries: This is
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46315:261"/>
                        <hi>to sit at the right Hand of God.</hi> So he is said <hi>to be in
the Bosom of the Father,</hi> John 1. 18. which bears the
same Signification with <hi>Matth. 3. 17. This is my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Son in whom I am well pleased;</hi> for whom we
Love, we familiarly embrace and take into our Bosoms.
So in the Gospel we find our Saviour setting
forth many Divine and Spiritual things by those that
are Humane and Carnal, herein comporting with
our Infirmities, and delivering those Sacred things
in such Language and Expression as are adequate to
our imperfect Ideas of those things. It is a known
Maxim among the Jews, and a very true one, <hi>The
Law speaks in the Language of the Sons of the Men;</hi> that
is, the Words of Scripture are accommodated to
the Vulgar Speech, and in that to the meanest Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions.
And this holds good not only of the
Old but New Testament. Wherefore it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonably
and maliciously<note n="*" place="bottom">Origen. cont. Cels. l. 6. &amp; Philocal. l. 1, &amp; 4.</note> objected by <hi>Celsus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Scriptures, that they were not politely
and accurately writ. <hi>Origen</hi> in answer to this tells
him, that this was purposely and designedly done,
namely, that all Persons might profit by the Holy
Writings, that the Vulgar and Illiterate, as well as
the Learned, might be edified by them: <hi>We have</hi>
(saith he, using the Apostle's Words) <hi>this Treasure
in Earthen Vessels, that the Excellency of the Power may
be of God, and not of Men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. It may further be observed, that the Holy
Scripture resembles the <hi>Phrases</hi> in Other Writers.
If any Critick should dare to find fault with the
Holy Stile, it were easy to defend it by maintaining
and proving that it speaks as the Best Authors and
Writers do: the Phraseology in them is alike in
sundry Places. Many Expressions of Heathens fall
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46315:262"/>
in exactly with the Terms of Scripture. <hi>To be at
the Feet of one,</hi> in the Sacred Stile signifies to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
to be his Servant, 1 <hi>Sam. 25. 27. 2 Sam. 15.
16. 1 Kings 20. 10. I call'd him to my Feet,</hi> Deut.
33. 3. <hi>i. e.</hi> I call'd him to follow me, to be my
Servant: and in several other Places the Scripture
speaks after this manner. The very same way of
Speaking is not unusual among profane Authors:
<hi>To stand at their Feet,</hi> was among the Romans,
applied to Servants, in respect of their Masters,
for they waited on them at Table, or as they lay
on their Beds with their Feet stretch'd out:
Whence that of <hi>Seneca,</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">De Benefic. l. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Servus qui coenanti ad pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des

                        <hi>Suetonius,

which I will next make good from those Texts
where there is mention of <hi>Light</hi> as it signifies <hi>Ioy</hi>
or <hi>Gladness;</hi> as in <hi>Psal. 97. 11. Light is sown for the
Righteous;</hi> which is thus explained in the next
Clause, <hi>and Gladness for the Vpright in Heart.</hi> Esth.

                        <hi>The shining of the
Face,</hi> which is often mentioned in the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
is of the same import, and is a farther Proof
that <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Ioy</hi> are synonymous. In <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and <hi>Isa. 58. 8. Light</hi> is no other than <hi>Ioy.</hi> So <hi>the
Candla,</hi> or <hi>Lamp of the Wicked,</hi> Job 21. 17. is their

that Grammar and Criticism are no Enemies
to Philosophy, it is probable that Men have chosen
to express and denote things that are <hi>joyful</hi> and
<hi>pleasant</hi> by the Name of <hi>Light,</hi> because this of all
things in the World is the most Chearing and

Light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the Eyes to
behold the Sun.</hi> And again, <hi>Prov. 15. 30. The Light
of the Eyes rejoiceth the Heart.</hi> It is both pleasant
in it self, and renders all other things so too. It is
an old Rabinnical Proverb, <hi>When the Sun ariseth, the

us see how the Sacred Dialect agrees with the Phrase
of the Best Writers. Out of all sorts of Authors
whatsoever he proves the Scripture-Stile to be
Proper and Elegant, which no Man before him
hath done so well and so largely. He compares
all along as he goeth, the Holy Stile with that of

who are the best Masters of that Language, and in

do. All this he hath most learnedly performed,

other) he is worth the perusal of all Ingenious
Men, especially those who are more devoted to

Polite and Critical Learning. This very same
Task is excellently performed by a<note n="*" place="bottom">Johan. Pricaeus.</note> Learned Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign

that an innumerable company of Greek and Latin

the same, and that they agree in their Stile, and
consequently that the Stile of Scripture is vouched
by the best Classick Authors, and (as a Consequent
of that) that he who carps at the Phrase and

                     <p>But to prosecute and illustrate this Theme yet
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46315:267"/>
further, I will be more particular. I will shew
first that there are in the Bible the same <hi>moral No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and expressed in the very same Stile, that
there are in Pagan Writers. Secondly, I will shew
that there are the same <hi>Grammatical</hi> and <hi>Rhetorical
Figures</hi> in the Holy Book that we meet with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in those Authors. First, I will observe to
you, that the Phrases and Terms whereby some of
the choicest Notions in Ethicks are set forth to us,
are alike in Divine and Humane Authors: As to
begin with that common Expression, to wit, of
calling our Course or State, or manner of Life in
this World, <hi>a Way.</hi> The Hebrew Word <hi>Derek,
Via, Semita,</hi> in almost innumerable Places in the
Old Testament, signifies <hi>our manner of Life:</hi> and
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the Greek Testament (which answers to
it) is commonly used in the same Sense. In this
latter Part of the Bible the Life of Man is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
expressed and represented as <hi>a double Way;</hi>
for our Saviour hath told us, that there is<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. 7. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi>
and a <hi>Broad Way.</hi> This is even the manner of
speaking among the best Moralists: they not only
call the Life, Actions, and Conversation of Men <hi>a
Way,</hi> (which is usual in all Languages) but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly
<hi>compare them to a Way,</hi> to <hi>a Path,</hi> and to
<hi>walking in it.</hi> As in Walking, saith <hi>Epictetus,</hi> you
take heed that you strike not your Foot against a
Stone or a Nail, and wrench your Foot; so in lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Life you are careful that you hurt not
your selves, or do any thing that may offend and
be prejudicial to your selves or others. And other
Masters of Ethicks are wont to pursue this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.
Yea moreover, they make use of the same
manner of Speech which our <hi>Saviour</hi> doth, that is,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46315:267"/>
they divide this <hi>Way</hi> into a <hi>Narrow</hi> and a <hi>Broad one.</hi>
Thus in <hi>Cebes</hi>'s <hi>Table</hi> the Way to true Learning
(which is the same with Vertue and Goodness, and

                           <hi>one Narrow Way,</hi> steep
and rugged, and trod by very few, and this
leads directly to the very End of the Journey:
and this Journey some diligent and laborious
Souls are endeavouring to perform with much
Work and Difficulty, with great Pains and
Sweat.</q> Thus that Admirable Platonist. And I
could shew you how other Philosophers are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with this way of Expression and Similitude
used by our Lord; but I will alledg no others at
present. It is enough to have shew'd that the Stile
of the Gentile Philosophers is not unlike that of our
Blessed Jesus, our Infallible Teacher and Prophet,
who thought it a fit way of setting forth the two
kinds of Life which Men lead, and the different
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46315:268"/>
Places and Ends they tend to, by naming one of
them <hi>the wide and broad Way;</hi> and the other, <hi>the
narrow and streight one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if the Life of Man be a <hi>Way,</hi> then he is a
<hi>Traveller;</hi> which invites me to speak of another
Moral Notion, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are all <hi>Travellers</hi> and
<hi>Pilgrims</hi> in this World: we are upon our <hi>Iourney,</hi>
and must behave our selves as those that are so.
<hi>Epictetus</hi> and <hi>Arrianus</hi> use this Metaphor, and apply
it handsomly to the Life of Man, especially to the
Life of a Good Man, which is a Journey from Earth
to Heaven. We are told that <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> pointed
with his Finger to Heaven, and cried out,<note n="*" place="bottom">Laert. in Anaxag.</note> 
                        <hi>That

are most admirable,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ex hac vita itâ discedo tanquam ex hospitio, non tanquam ex domo: commorandi enim diversorium natura nobis, non habitandi dedit. Cic. de Senect.</note> 
                        <q>I go out of this World as
out of an Inn, not a Mansion-house; for Nature
hath not given us here a Place of long Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but of a short Diversion and transitory En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</q>
And he had arrived to this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and expressed it most bravely when he said,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Erigamus in Coelum oculos tanquam in Patriam, in quam nobis aliquando redeundum est.</note> 
                        <q>Let us lift up our Eyes to Heaven as to our
Country, to which we must think of returning
some time or other.</q> And such kind of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
you meet with in <hi>Antoninus</hi> and other select
Moralists. I will conclude with the Words of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="bottom">Peregrinatio est vita; multùm cùm deambulaveris, domum redeundum est. De Remed. Fort.</note> 
                        <q>Our Life is a Pilgrimage, (saith he;)
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:46315:268"/>
when we have travell'd and walk'd about a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
time, we must return home.</q> This is
the very Language and Notion of the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and of the Holy Men whose Lives they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.
The Old Patriarchs owned themselves to be
<hi>Pilgrims;</hi> Gen. 47. 9. <hi>The Days of the Years of my
Pilgrimage,</hi> &amp;c. And that you may not think it is
meant only of their travelling from Place to Place
in those Days, you will find this was said by some
of their Posterity after they were possess'd of the
Promised Land, and were no longer in the unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
Condition of their Predecessors. <hi>We are
Strangers before thee, and Sojourners, as were all our
Fathers,</hi> saith the Pious King, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 15. And
in the next Words he lets us know what he means;
<hi>Our Days on Earth are as a Shadow, and there is no
abiding:</hi> so that the whole Race of Mankind are all
equally <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Sojourners</hi> in this World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
are<note n="*" place="bottom">Psal. 39. 12. Psal. 119. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Strangers in the Earth,</hi> as the same devout
Man often acknowledgeth: and this World is stiled
by him<note n="†" place="bottom">Psal. 119. 54.</note> 
                        <hi>the House of his Pilgrimage.</hi> After the
same manner St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks, calling this Life
<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Pet. 1. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>the time of our sojourning here:</hi> and he exhorts the
converted Jews, to whom he writes, to deport
themselves <hi>as Strangers and Pilgrims,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 11.
which I confess may have a more particular Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to their being expell'd out of <hi>Iudea</hi> their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, and dwelling in a strange Place,
(whence he stiles them <hi>scattered Strangers,</hi> in the
beginning of the Epistle) but notwithstanding this
the Apostle might apply it to them in the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Notion, and as they (with all other Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
are Pilgrims travelling to another World.
With respect to which the other great Apostle
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:46315:269"/>
saith, <hi>Here we have no continuing City, but we seek
one to come,</hi> Heb. 13. 14. We have no fix'd Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
we have no settled Place of Abode; we
(with other holy Men before us) must <hi>confess we
are Pilgrims,</hi> Heb. 11. 13. We belong to another
Country, we are Citizens of the <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that is
above; <hi>We look</hi> (as all the holy Pilgrims hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
did) <hi>for a City which hath Foundations, whose
Builder and Maker is God,</hi> Heb. 11. 10. We are
passing through this World to that Heavenly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis;
we are travelling with our <hi>Caravan</hi> to
that <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> that <hi>Holy Land;</hi> and our
Thoughts, our Wishes, our Desires, our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
are there already.</p>
                     <p>Again, that it may appear that Heathen Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and the Holy Scripture have the same way of
Expression, I will shew that they both agree to say,
<hi>the Life of Man is a Warfare:</hi> Thus it is called in
the ancient Book of <hi>Iob,</hi> ch. 7. 1. for the word
<hi>Tsaba,</hi> though it be rendred by us <hi>an appointed time,</hi>
is as capable (if not more) of being translated <hi>a
Warfare:</hi> And so St. <hi>Ierom</hi> renders it, <hi>The Life of
Man is a Warfare on Earth.</hi> And again, <hi>cb.</hi> 14. 14.
<hi>The Days of our Warfare</hi> are the Term of Man's
Life. Such Holy <hi>Iob</hi> found it to be. The War
was warm, the Service was hot, the Battel was fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and he was set in the Front of it. Though
this great Heroick Warrior fainted in the Conflict
sometimes, yet his Valour was very eminent, and
he fought it out resolutely, and won the Day, and
was signally rewarded by the great Arbiter of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
<hi>the Lord of Hosts.</hi> It cannot escape our Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that several <hi>Military</hi> Expressions are used by
the Holy Ghost in Scripture, to set forth the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Offices of Man's Life, and to let us know
that it is a continual Combate and Fight. Yea,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46315:269"/>
                        <hi>Tsaba, militare,</hi> is applied to the Ecclesiastick
Function and Ministry of the Levites in the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle:
their Service or Waiting is call'd a <hi>Warfare,
Numb.</hi> 8. 25. and in the Verse before, <hi>a warring a
Warfare,</hi> if we render it exactly according to the
Hebrew. Especially this way of Speaking is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to the troublesome and afflictive Part of Man's
Life, which is rightly call'd by St. <hi>Paul, the Fight of
Afflictions,</hi> Heb. 10. 32. And with regard to this,
without doubt, those comfortable Words were
spoken to <hi>Ierusalem, Her War is accomplished,</hi> Isa.
40. 2. But more eminently in the New Testament
this Mode of Speech is observable, where <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
is represented as <hi>a Warfare,</hi> and the Christian
Church as <hi>Militant</hi> here on Earth. St. <hi>Paul</hi> is pleased
to stile our Saviour,<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 2. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>the Captain of our Salvation;</hi>

more peculiarly to the <hi>Olympick</hi> Combates, as

belonging to this Spiritual War. And these <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi>
(which are call'd <hi>the whole Armour of God</hi>) are
particularly enumerated by the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.
13, 14. I could observe to you in that Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of St. <hi>Iames,</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="bottom">Jam. 4. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Submit your selves to God; resist

three Military Terms: 1. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, be subject
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46315:270"/>
to your Commander, observe his Orders, look for
the Signal of Battel from him, keep the Station
that is set you, be obedient to the Discipline of
War, in all things be ruled by your General; for
(as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith very appositely when he is speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the <hi>Christian Souldier</hi>)<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>He that warreth must
concern himself in nothing else but the pleasing of him
who hath chosen him to be a Souldier.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
withstand, oppose, engage the Enemy; be sure
you give him Battel, make a resolute and vigorous
Onset, charge through his whole Body, make a
Lane through his thickest Troops. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
he shall be put to Flight, he shall certainly be rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and defeated, and never be able to rally again;
and so Victory at last crowns the Combate. But
St. <hi>Paul</hi> more briefly tells us what is the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a <hi>Christian Souldier,</hi> when he saith,<note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Tim. 2. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
Hardness as a good Souldier of Iesus Christ:</hi> for
in that one word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, he lets us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that he is one that is to fare hardly, that he
is to be inured to Difficulties and Perils, to tedious
Marches and continual Watchings, to Hunger and
Thirst, and infinite Fatigues, and that he must
converse with Dangers and Death: <hi>Every Battel of
the Warrior is with confused Noise, and Garments roll'd
in Blood.</hi> The Life of a Christian Souldier is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and laborious, because he is to be exercised in
denying himself, in crossing his sensual Appetite,
in submitting to the hardest Duties, and undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the greatest Sufferings, Temptations and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions:
He must be continually sweating, toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
striving, fighting, grappling with Foes of all
kinds, and encountring all sorts of Hardships. Thus
a Christian is a <hi>Spiritual Souldier;</hi> thus Christianity
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46315:270"/>
is a <hi>Holy War;</hi> thus the Life of Man is a <hi>Warfare.</hi>
And this is that which all the Great Masters of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
inculcate in their Writings. One of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of them (who calls the Life of Man <hi>the Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>

Denomination of a<note n="*" place="bottom">

Conceptions of Humane Life, and once and again
resembles it to<note n="*" place="bottom">Vivere, militare est. Epist. 96.</note> the State of War, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits
of Martial Men. As soon as we come into
the World we open the Campagne, and in a short
time after we draw into a Line of Battle, and we
are continually making use of our Ammunition and
Artillery, till at length Death raises the Camp,
and discharges us from our Warfare. Several Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
might be produced out of other Pagan Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who frequently fall into this Comparison,
and use this Excellent Metaphor, and very finely
illustrate it: but what I have said is sufficient to
shew what I aim at, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are the same
Phrases and Expressions in the Holy Scriptures that
there are in other Authors.</p>
                     <p>This I will further make good in another Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46315:271"/>
Notion and Maxim, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Good and Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Men are Free, but that all Vitious Persons are Slaves.</hi>
The Stile of Scripture runs this way, not only in
the Old Testament, where <hi>David</hi> desires to be
<note n="*" place="bottom">Psal, 51. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>upheld by the free Spirit</hi> of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> by such a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Generous Principle as would make him act
with the greatest <hi>Freedom</hi> in the ways of Religion:
and where Sinners and Ungodly Men are stiled <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners</hi>
and <hi>Captives</hi> once and again; as in <hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 11.
<hi>Isa. 42. 6, 7. ch. 49. 8, 9. ch.</hi> 61. 1. Nor is it to
be doubted whether these Places speak of such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
seeing our Saviour himself alledges one of
them (which is of the same Nature with the rest)
to this Purpose, and tells us, it is his Office <hi>to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
Liberty to these Captives,</hi> Luke 4. 18. <hi>i. e.</hi> to
offer Pardon to Sinners. But in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
also (and there chiefly) this is the Language
of the Holy Ghost: the <hi>Freedom</hi> that accompanies
Holiness, and the <hi>Servitude</hi> of Sin, are expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in those Words of Christ, <hi>The Truth shall
make you free,</hi> John 8. 32. <hi>Whosoever committeth
Sin, is the Servant of Sin,</hi> ver. 34. <hi>If the Son shall
make you free, ye shall be free indeed,</hi> ver. 36. The
whole sixth Chapter to the Romans treats of this
very thing, the <hi>Service</hi> of Sin, and the <hi>Freedom</hi>
from it by Christ. <hi>The Servants of Sin</hi> mentioned
here by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> are the same with<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. 3. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>the Spirits in
Prison</hi> whom St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of, as I have proved in
another Place, and have shewed the Inconsistency
of other Interpretations. Whilst Men continue in
their Sins, and addict themselves to their Vices,
their Spirits, their Souls are deservedly said to be
<hi>in Prison;</hi> their Persons are <hi>in Custody;</hi> they live in
Durance and Thraldom; they are continually in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46315:271"/>
Bonds and Chains; they are fetter'd Slaves and
Vassals: They may perhaps flatter themselves, and
vaunt of Freedom, but they are Prisoners still;
<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. 2. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>they promise Liberty, but are themselves Servants of
Corruption.</hi> Whereas, on the contrary, True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
enstates Men in a real and substantial Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
Christianity is<note n="†" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 25.</note>

                        <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is,</hi> where Evangelical
Sanctity is, <hi>there is Liberty.</hi> In short; no Man that
loves to be vicious, and lives in the practice of Sin,
can be said to be a <hi>Free-man;</hi> for he is wholly at
the command of his Lusts: There is not a greater
Slave in <hi>Algiers</hi> or <hi>Tripoli</hi> than such an one. This

<hi>iterum ad se venire,</hi> is all one with <hi>ad se re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire,</hi>

he would rise again after his Death, yea and had
set the time of his Resurrection, <hi>viz.</hi> within three
days; yet when they saw he was dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they had
no belief of any such thing, but utterly despair'd
of it. Herein they shewed themselves very Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composed
Persons, this argued them to be besides
themselves, and that Conduct of Reason and Faith
which might have been expected from them. But
when <hi>they went into the Sepulchre, and saw the Linen
Clothes lie by themselves,</hi> v. 6, 7. which was a plain
sign that the Body was not stolen away, for then
the Clothes would have been taken away too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they would not have staid to strip the Body:
<hi>When the Disciples saw this, they believed,</hi> v. 8. tho
(as it follows) <hi>as yet they knew not the Scripture, that
he must rise again from the Dead,</hi> v. 9. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, they were not induced to this <hi>Belief</hi> by
considering the Prophecies in the Old Testament
concerning Christ's Resurrection, but they <hi>believed</hi>
because they <hi>saw.</hi> The sight of the Linen Clothes
and the Napkin lest in the Sepulchre, cured them of
their former Unbelief, and convinced them that
Christ was really risen, and had thrown off those
Ensigns of Mortality, and lest them behind him
in the Sepulchre. <gap reason="foreign">

what is said before. St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> were
heal'd of the former Distemper and Malady of
their Minds which they laboured under, by descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
into the Grave, and seeing what was there.
Now their Ignorance and Infidelity vanish, now
they are brought to a due Composure of Thoughts,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46315:274"/>
which they wanted before. And indeed this is not
the first time that these very Apostles were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
in Mind. <hi>They knew not what they said</hi>
(<hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 6.) when they were on the Mount at
Christ's Transfiguration: one or both of these
discovered how disordered they were in their
Practice as well as Notions, when they <hi>call'd for Fire
from Heaven</hi> upon the Samaritans, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 54. and
at several other times they acted contrary to sober
Reason and the right Apprehensions which they
ought to have had of things. But they afterwards
recovered themselves, and had better Notions of
things, and acted more conformably to the Dictates
of a Composed Intellect. Thus here, they recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
themselves, <hi>they came again to themselves.</hi>

                     <p>Once more I will observe how the Scripture
speaks as the best Moralists do, <hi>viz.</hi> when it calls
<hi>Death a Sleep.</hi> The Hebrew Verb <hi>Shacab</hi> signifies
<hi>to lie down to sleep,</hi> Gen. 19. 4. and likewise <hi>to die,</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Sam. 7. 12. Isa.</hi> 14. 8. whence <hi>to sleep with their
Fathers</hi> is an usual Phrase in the Historical Books of
the Old Testament. Thence the <hi>Grave</hi> is call'd a
<hi>Bed,</hi> Isa. 57. 2. <hi>Gneres</hi> is both <hi>lectus</hi> and <hi>feretrum,</hi>
the Bed of those that sleep, and the Bed or Bier of
those that are dead, (as perhaps our Saxon word
<hi>grave,</hi> or <hi>grab,</hi> as other Germans write it, is from
<hi>grabatus.</hi>) The Psalmist mentions <hi>the Sleep of Death,</hi>
Psal. 13. 3. And it seems this was the Stile of the
Antient <hi>Arabs,</hi> as appears from <hi>Iob 7. 21. I shall sleep
in the Dust.</hi> If we descend to the New Testament,
we shall read there that <hi>Lazarus sleepeth,</hi> Joh. 11. 11.

that there are the very same Expressions in

                     <argument>
                        <p>There are in the Sacred Writ the same Grammatical
Figures which are found in other Writers; as an
Enallage of Person, of Number, of Time. One
Bodily Sense is mentioned instead of another. There
is an exchange of the Positive, Comparative and
Superlative. A Negative is put for a Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
this shew'd in a great number of Instances in
the Writings both of the Old and New Testament.
An Hendyadis is usual in Scripture. So is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsis.
And an Hysterosis. The reason which
Monsieur Simon gives of this latter is refuted,
1. By proving the Antiquity of Parchment-scrolls
used in writing. 2. By shewing that they were well
fastned together, so that they could not easily be
misplaced and transposed, much less be lost, as
this Writer imagines. Josephus's remarkable Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
produced to confirm both these. The true
reason and occasion of some Transpositions in the
Old Testament assigned.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the next place I will shew you that there
are in the Sacred Writ the same <hi>Grammatical</hi>
and <hi>Rhetorical Figures</hi> which are found in Other
Writers. It will be very useful to insist a while
upon these, because we cannot attain to a right
understanding of the Scriptures unless we have
some insight into them; yea we shall sometimes
miserably mistake the sense and meaning of this
Holy Book if we are not acquainted with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Scripture-Stile as to this very thing.
I know these Figures (some of them especially)
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:46315:277"/>
are observed and taken notice of by<note n="*" place="bottom">Glassius, Joach. Camerarius, Westhemerus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> several
Writers: but my chief Design is to give some
Instances of them which are not taken notice of
by Others, and yet are very necessary to be known
in order to the right understanding the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
There are several of these I shall produce.
You must know then that those <hi>Grammatical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi>
or Defective Modes of speaking which are
found in the Bible, are such as these. First, there
is an <hi>Enallage of the Person, i. e.</hi> it is usual to put
one Person in Grammatical Construction for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thus <hi>we</hi> is instead of <hi>they,</hi> Psal. 66. 6. <hi>your
Heart</hi> for <hi>their Heart,</hi> Psal. 22. 26. <hi>They</hi> for <hi>he,</hi>
Eccles. 7. 29. <hi>they have sought out,</hi> which refers to
<hi>Man</hi> in the preceding Clause. <hi>They</hi> instead of <hi>ye,</hi>
Isa. 61. 7. <hi>They</hi> for <hi>she,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 15. if they
continue,</hi> i. e. if <hi>she, viz.</hi> the Woman spoken of
before, <hi>continue in Faith,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>she</hi> is expresly
mentioned in the Clause immediately foregoing.
So in <hi>Gal. 6. 1. thy self</hi> should be <hi>themselves,</hi> for it
refers to <hi>ye</hi> in the preceding words. But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
are almost numberless, wherein I might shew
you this Change of Persons. It is enough to have
hinted this at present, that you may continually
take notice of this in the Stile of the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and that you may direct your selves in the
understanding of some places, which cannot right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be interpreted unless we observe this Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Alteration, and thereby guide our Thoughts
to the sense of the words. And this also might be
suggested, that this way of Speech is used then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
when there is a sudden <hi>Transition</hi> from one
thing to another, or when there is a <hi>Distribution</hi> of
the Matter treated of, and sometimes when there
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46315:278"/>
is a <hi>Familiar</hi> and <hi>Easy expressing</hi> of things yea at
other times, when a near <hi>Concernedness</hi> of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
spoken of is to be taken notice of.</p>
                     <p>Next you may observe the <hi>Change of Number;</hi>
you will find it common in Scripture to express
one Number by another, especially the Singular by
the Plural. As 'tis said <hi>the Ark rested on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Ararat, i. e.</hi> on one of those Mountains,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 4. for it could not rest on them all. <hi>The
Graves are ready for me,</hi> Job 17. 1. instead of <hi>the
Grave,</hi> and so in <hi>ch. 21. v.</hi> 32. according to the
Hebrew, tho not in our Translation. A <hi>single Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
is meant when <hi>Rivers</hi> are named, as you read
of <hi>the Gates of the Rivers,</hi> when <hi>Tigris</hi> only is
meant, <hi>Nah.</hi> 2. 6. That <hi>Sacrifices</hi> is put for a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 23. is plain; for the Apostle
there speaks of the Sacrifice and Death of Christ.

the Hebrew hath it) for <hi>Branches.</hi> A <hi>Sheaf</hi> for
<hi>Sheaves,</hi> Amos 2. 13. And the like is observable
in the New Testament, <hi>that they may shave their

21. <hi>Heart</hi> for <hi>Hearts,</hi> Rom. 1. 21. and the same
Enallage is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. Thus it is the usual way
of the Sacred Writers (who in this, as in many
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46315:278"/>
other things are followed by the best Greek and
Latin Authors) to exchange one Number for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and it will be requisite for the Inquisitive
Reader to observe this manner of speaking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
otherwise sometimes he will miss of the true

use of.</p>
                     <p>I pass to the <hi>Enallage of Time,</hi> which is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in the Holy Writ. In the Prophetick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
especially this is observable; there the Present,
or rather the Praeterperfect Tense (for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews
have no Present Tense) is used very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
for the Future, as in 1 <hi>Kings 13. 2. A Child
is born</hi> (according to the Hebrew) for <hi>shall be born.</hi>
Isa. 9. 2. <hi>The People that walked in Darkness have seen
a great Light,</hi> prophetically for <hi>shall see.</hi> Ch. 9. 6.
<hi>Unto us a Child is born; unto us a Son is given,</hi> instead
of <hi>shall be born, shall be given.</hi> So in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
in that Prophecy of <hi>Enoch</hi> quoted by St.
<hi>Iude,</hi> ver. 14. <hi>The Lord cometh</hi> (or <hi>hath come) with
ten thousand of his Saints;</hi>

in our E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>glish Bibles. In such like Places
things are spoken in the Present or Praeterperfect
Tense, to signify the Reality and Certainty of
them, to let us know they shall as surely be fulfill'd
as if they were so already. And as the Present or
Praeterit is put for the Future, so this is sometimes
used instead of that, as in <hi>Exod. 3. 14. Ehjeh, ero,</hi>
is instead of <hi>sum;</hi> and accordingly the 70 Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
render that Place <gap reason="foreign">

them, <hi>I am that I am.</hi> The like Enallage you will
find in <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 32. And sometimes the Praeterit is
used where the Present Time is understood, as in

7. 28. are generally reduced by Expositors to this
Head, and therefore our English Version is [He
that is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than

this way of speaking. For according to the Greek
it should be, <hi>he that is lesser:</hi> and this is the true
and natural Translation, the meaning of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Words being this, I am lesser, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Age,
I am Younger than <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, and am Lesser
in the Estimation of the People than he is; but yet

shall serve the younger.</hi> So that you see <hi>the lesser</hi> is
interpreted <hi>the younger;</hi> and there seems to be
good Ground to understand it so in this Place. And
indeed this is according to the Stile of the best La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin

But in <hi>Phil. 1, 23. Having a Desire to depart, and to
be with Christ, which is far better,</hi> it is not to be
questioned, I think, that the <hi>Superlative</hi> is changed
for the <hi>Comparative; far better</hi> is instead of <hi>best of
all.</hi> And so in <hi>Matth. 13. 32. the lesser of all Seeds</hi>
(according to the Greek) for <hi>the least;</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
we translate it so. Other Examples of this
you have in <hi>Luke 9. 46. Iohn</hi> 10. 29. These are the
Grammatical Changes which are observable in the
Holy Book; and any one that hath perused the
Writings of Other Authors, especially of the
Greek and Latin Poets, is not ignorant that the
very same occur in them, and that very often; so
that I thought it needless to present you with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels
out of those Writers.</p>
                     <p>But among the several Enallages, <hi>i. e.</hi> Changings
of one thing for another in the Stile of Scripture,
I will in the last Place mention this, <hi>viz.</hi> that a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi>
oftentimes is put for a <hi>Comparative.</hi> The
due observing of this will help us to reconcile ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Places of Scripture, which seem to jar with
some others. I will begin with <hi>Numb. 23. 21. He
hath not beheld Iniquity in</hi> Jacob, <hi>neither hath he seen
Perverseness in</hi> Israel: Which is a Text that the
<hi>Antinomian</hi> Party lay great Stress upon; for hence
they say 'tis evident that God sees not any Sin in his
own People, and consequently that he is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with them for it: whence it will follow that
they need not be displeased neither; their Sins
(be they never so great and flagitious) are not to
be the matter of their Sorrow, seeing God is not
offended with them: which Doctrine soon opens
a Door to all Licentiousness and Profaneness:
but it is easily shut again by applying this Rule,
that Scripture oftentimes, and here particularly,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46315:280"/>
speaks Absolutely, but is to be understood in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
or Limited Sense. <hi>God beholds not Iniquity
in</hi> Jacob, in his Chosen, as he doth in profligate
Persons, and such as are given up to their Lusts;
<hi>i. e.</hi> he beholds it not so in them as to reject them
utterly, and to punish them eternally for their Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings.
Thus if we <hi>compare</hi> God's beholding Sin
in the one, with his beholding it in the other, he
may be said <hi>not to behold</hi> it in the former, <hi>i. e.</hi> in his
own People and Servants. But God hates and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth
Sin in both sorts of Persons, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in those that are his, according to what
he declares in <hi>Amos 3. 2. You only have I known of
all the Families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you
for all your Iniquities.</hi> Thus God did not <hi>behold</hi> Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
did not <hi>see</hi> Perverseness in <hi>Israel;</hi> for we
are assured by the Prophet<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> that <hi>he is of
purer Eyes than to behold Evil, and cannot look on Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
He cannot look on it long without punishing
it, as well as he hated it always. Why then do some
confidently aver, that God neither punishes nor
hates Sin in his People, nor is displeased with them
for it? Thus by making use of the foregoing Rule,
we see what is the plain and natural Meaning of
the Words. In a Comparative Sense, not in an
Absolute and Unrestrained one, it is said, <hi>He beholds
not Iniquity in</hi> Jacob: which is so far from favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Antinomian Doctrine, that it clearly baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles
and confutes it. I will pass to another Text,
<hi>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me,
1 Sam.</hi> 8. 7. They did reject <hi>Samuel</hi> from being
Judg, in that they chose a King over them: yet
God saith, <hi>They have not rejected thee,</hi> i. e. Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:46315:281"/>
they have <hi>not:</hi> they have <hi>not so much</hi> by
this Action of despising <hi>Samuel</hi> their Judg, rejected
him, as they have manifested their Rejection of
Me, who am their Chief Judg and Ruler, and who
set <hi>Samuel</hi> over them as my Deputy. They may
be said to have rejected Me <hi>rather than</hi> him. The
Psalmist faith, <hi>Against thee, thee only have I sinned,
Psal.</hi> 51. 4. But though he speaks Exclusively, and
in a manner Negatively, (for it is as much as if he
had said, Against thee have I sinned, and <hi>not</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any one besides) yet he is to be understood
Comparatively, for it is certain that he sinn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Others, namely, against <hi>Uriah</hi> in a signal
manner, whom he made drunk, and whose Blood
he shed, and whose Bed he desiled; yea, as he was
King, he notoriously sinn'd against all his Subjects
and People: But because he <hi>Chiefly</hi> and <hi>Principally</hi>
sinn'd against God who had raised him to the
Throne, and done such wonderful things for him;
because he had <hi>most of all</hi> offended God, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
that he had sinn'd against Him, and Him <hi>only,</hi>
Him and <hi>none</hi> else. A Negative is used for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative.
And so it is in <hi>Hos. 6. 6. I desired Mercy
and not Sacrifice;</hi> which is explained in the next
Clause of that Verse, <hi>and the Knowledg of God more
than Burnt-offerings. Not</hi> is interpreted by <hi>more.</hi>
God values Acts of Mercy and Charity, and such
indispensable Duties of the Moral Law, <hi>more than</hi>
all the Performances of the Ceremonial one. So
that the <hi>Antithesis</hi> here is but in way of <hi>Comparison,</hi>
as we may see in 1 <hi>Sam. 15. 22. To obey is better than Sacrifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The New Testament speaks after this manner,
there you will frequently observe that our Saviour
and his Apostles pronounce many things simply and
absolutely, which yet we ought to understand and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46315:281"/>
interpret with a Limitation.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mark 5. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>She is not dead, but
sleepeth,</hi> faith Christ of <hi>Iairus</hi>'s deceased Daughter.
She was dead, that cannot be denied; therefore
this Negative must be expounded so as to qualify
the Sense: She <hi>rather</hi> sleepeth than is dead: Her
Departure is a Sleep to her, and I will soon awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
her out of it, as you shall see. Thus our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
must be supposed to have spoken. Again, he
faith,<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke 14. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>When thou makest a Dinner or a Supper, call
not thy Friends, nor thy Brethren, neither thy Kinsmen
nor thy rich Neighbours; but call the Poor, the Maimed,
the Lame, the Blind.</hi> The meaning is, <hi>rather</hi> call
these than them; yea, rather wholly omit these
Feasts and Invitations, than forget to be charitable
to the Poor. If the Necessitous be not excluded
from your Charity, you may feast your <hi>rich</hi> Friends
and Relations: but you must <hi>not</hi> feast Them, and
neglect These; yea, you must <hi>chiefly</hi> and <hi>most of all</hi>
take care of these. So is that other Passage of our
Saviour to be understood, <hi>Labour not for the Meat
which perisheth,</hi> John 6. 27. <hi>i. e.</hi> labour <hi>more</hi> for that
Meat which endureth unto Everlasting Life (which
he immediately after speaks of) than for this. You
may labour for the perishing Meat, but let your
<hi>greatest</hi> Care and Indeavour be for that which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
perisheth. Still you see the Negative is to be
explain'd by a Comparative. And so it is in <hi>Iohn
16. 24. Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my Name,
i. e.</hi> ye have asked little, which is comparatively
Nothing. Thus the Apostle is to be meant when
he saith, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 5. He hath not grieved me,</hi> that
is, me only, as is clear from the following Words,
<hi>but in part all,</hi> for so it should be rendred according
to the Greek, and a Parenthesis should be made.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46315:282"/>
                        <hi>In part</hi> (saith the Apostle) he hath brought Grief
and Trouble to you all; I say, <hi>in part, that I may
not overcharge him,</hi> that I may not aggravate his
Fault too much. But, to speak Comparatively,
and with respect to the whole Church, <hi>he hath not
grieved me,</hi> because I am inconsiderable in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of all of you. The following Texts of St.
<hi>Paul</hi> are to be explained thus: 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 4. We that
are in this Tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for
that we should be unclothed, i. e.</hi> not for that only, or
Comparatively not for that. <hi>Charity seeketh not her
own,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 5. <hi>i. e.</hi> not solely and chiefly. In
respect of her generous Designs of Good for Others,
she may be said <hi>not</hi> to seek her Own Good and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
From which Sense of the Words we may
know to interpret those other Texts; <hi>Let no Man
seek his own, but every Man another's Wealth,</hi> 1 Cor.
10. 24. <hi>All seek their own,</hi> Phil. 2. 21. When
this Apostle faith, <hi>We wrestle not against Flesh and
Blood, but against Principalities,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. the
Sense certainly must be this, We wrestle not <hi>only</hi>
or <hi>chiefly</hi> against those, but <hi>rather,</hi> yea <hi>most</hi> against
these. Though we combate with our selves and
our corrupt Natures, and with evil Men, yet our
main Conflict is with the Spirits of Darkness, the
Apostate Angels, who are hourly tempting and
solic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ting us to Vice, that they may bring us into
the same State of Condemnation with themselves.
So when we are told that <hi>the Law is not made for a
righteous Man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for
the Ungodly and for Sinners,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 8. we
must not with an Antinomian Gloss upon the
Words exempt righteous and godly Men from their
Obligation to the Moral Law; for the Negative
here hath not the Import of an Absolute Denial,
but signifies only that the delivering of the Law,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46315:282"/>
and especially the Commination of it, were not <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily</hi>
and <hi>chiefly</hi> designed for the Righteous, for

let it not be the outward adorning of plaiting the Hair, and
of wearing of Gold, or of putting on of Apparel, but let
it be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>idden Man of the Heart,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 3, 4.
None can imagine that all <hi>outward adorning</hi> and
<hi>wearing of Gold,</hi> or <hi>putting on Apparel</hi> or <hi>costly Array,</hi>
are utterly unlawful, and consequently forbidden
here; wherefore the Words are to be taken with
some Restriction; they are spoken Comparatively,
that is, the <hi>Inward Adorning</hi> is <hi>far better,</hi> and <hi>much
more</hi> to be look'd after than the Outward and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
one. Christian Women must adorn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<hi>rather</hi> with Humility and Sobriety than with
these. They ought not to be so solicitous about
Apparel, as about the Inward Ornaments of the
Soul. Nay, whatever Apparel is light and vain,
and any ways administers to Lust, or Pride, or
Wantonness, is wholly to be laid aside, as sinful
and unlawful. In the same Chapter of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> you read, that <hi>Adam was
not deceived, but the Woman,</hi> ver. 14. We know
that <hi>Adam</hi> was deceived, but yet in a Comparative
way of speaking he was <hi>not,</hi> that is, his Deception
was not so gross and inexcusable as that of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
It is said of the faithful Patriarchs, that
<hi>they received not the Promise,</hi> Heb. 11. 39. <hi>i. e.</hi> in
comparison of what we have since received. They
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:46315:283"/>
received it not in the full extent; else you cannot
make sense of the following words, <hi>God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>aving
provided,</hi> &amp;c. In the foresaid Chapter of St. <hi>Peter</hi>
'tis said, <hi>Baptism doth also now save us, not the putting
away the Filth of the Flesh, but the answer of a good
Conscience towards God,</hi> ver. 21. This <hi>not</hi> seems to
be Exclusive and Negative, and thence some have
made use of this Text to null the sacred Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Baptism, which in Contempt they call
<hi>Water-Baptism.</hi> But they err, not knowing the
Scriptures, and particularly not attending to the
sense of this place, where <hi>not</hi> is no Absolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
but a Comparative. <hi>Not the putting away
the Filth of the Flesh, i. e.</hi> not the Outward Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
simply and only, or not that in Comparison of
the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the Inward washing and purifying
by the Spirit. And many other places it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to understand aright, unless you make use
of this Observation which I have here exemplified,
namely that a <hi>Comparison</hi> is commonly in Scripture
express'd by an <hi>Antithesis,</hi> or, which is all one,
that a <hi>Negative</hi> is put for a <hi>Comparative.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the next place, I might observe to you that an
<hi>Hendyadis</hi> is very usual in Scripture, that is, two
things are put severally to signify but one, as <hi>Let
the Lights be in the Firmament for Signs and for
Seasons,</hi> Gen. 1. 14. <hi>i. e.</hi> (as some Expositors think,
tho I am not satisfied about it) Let them be for
Signs of the Seasons. And they who read <hi>Psal.</hi>
17. 13, 14. thus, <hi>Deliver my Soul from the Wicked
by thy Sword, from Men by thy Hand,</hi> tell us here is
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the Sword</hi> and <hi>the Hand,</hi> for a Sword
handled or drawn, as if the Psalmist called upon
God here to be his <hi>Champion,</hi> and to deliver him
by fighting for him. That in <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. is of the
nature of an <hi>Hendyadis;</hi> for <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>aptizing with the Holy
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46315:283"/>
Ghost and with Fire,</hi> is the same with <hi>baptizing with
the Holy Ghost, who is as Fire;</hi> and so here One
thing is express'd as if it were Two. Some think
there is the same Figure in <hi>Iohn 3. 5. Except a Man
be born of Water and of the Spirit he cannot enter into
the Kingdom of God. Water and the Spirit,</hi> i. e. say
they, the Spirit that is like Water, cleansing and
purifying the Soul. But I conceive it may be
doubted whether this and the former way of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be the same; for if <hi>Water</hi> in this place signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<hi>Bapt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>sm,</hi> as the Antients interpreted it, then
'tis not the same thing with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but distinct
from it, and consequently here are not two things
put for one. But doubtless there are in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.
31. <hi>He shall send his Angels with a Trumpet, and a
great Sound, i. e.</hi> with a Trumpet that hath a great
Sound, that makes a great Noise, or, as our
Translators render it, <hi>with a great Sound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet.</hi>
To this way of speaking may be referr'd
<hi>Iohn 11. 33. He groan'd in the Spirit and was troubled,
i. e.</hi> he groan'd in his troubled Spirit. And of this
kind is <hi>Acts 14. 13. The Priest of</hi> Jupiter <hi>brought
Oxen and Garlands, i. e.</hi> Oxen crown'd with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
as was usual when they sacrificed to <hi>Iupiter.</hi>
One thing is here intended, tho 'tis express'd by
two. To this Figure appertains <hi>Acts 15. 28. It
seemeth good to the Holy Ghost and to us,</hi> that is, to us
directed, moved and guided by the Holy Ghost.
I doubt not but an <hi>Hendyadis</hi> gives the best account
of 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 4. My preaching was in Demonstration of
the Spirit and of Power, i. e.</hi> of the Spirit who was
Powerful, and enabled me in an extraordinary
manner to demonstrate the Truth of the Gospel,
and to convince Gainsayers; and who also enabled
me to work Miracles for the confirming of what
I preached. This is the same with <hi>Rom. 15. 19.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46315:284"/>
the Power of the Spirit of God,</hi> by which (as he
there tells us) <hi>mighty Signs and Wonders</hi> were ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
The like mode of Speech is observable
in the Apostle's words, in 1 <hi>Thess. 1. 5. Our Gospel
came unto you in Power and in the Holy Ghost, i. e.</hi> the
Holy Ghost shew'd himself Powerful in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
Preaching and Miracles. Lastly, under this
Head may be rank'd <hi>Col. 2. 8. Philosophy and vain
Deceit,</hi> that is, Philosophy which is both vain and
deceitful.</p>
                     <p>To proceed, a <hi>Prolepsis</hi> is another usual Figure in
Scripture, especially in the Old Testament. Such
is that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 16. Cain <hi>went and dwelt in the Land
of Nod,</hi> where it seems to be implied that <hi>Nod</hi>
was the Name of that place which he went to,
and that it was named so before he went to it:
whereas it is most probable that that Place was
not call'd by that Name at that time, for it had its
Name of <hi>Nod</hi> given to it from <hi>Cain</hi>'s going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was a<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Nad</hi> Gen. 4. 12. from <hi>Nud</hi> vagari, errare.</note> 
                        <hi>Vagabond.</hi> So there is a plain
Prolepsis or Anticipation in <hi>Gen. 14. 7. They smote
all the Country of the Amalekites,</hi> tho at that time
there were no <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and therefore the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
could not be named from them. In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 1.
it is said <hi>Israel pitched beside Eben-ezer,</hi> but there
was no place of that Name then, for you will find
it given afterwards. Those words in <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 20.
<hi>Iacob served seven Years for Rachel,</hi> are spoken Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptically,
not as if he did not marry <hi>Rachel</hi> before
the seven Years were expired. We read in <hi>Gen.</hi>
35. 19. and <hi>ch. 48. v.</hi> 7. that <hi>Rachel was buried in
Bethlchem,</hi> but it is well known that that was not
the Name of the Place till after <hi>Moses.</hi> So <hi>Hebron</hi>
and some other Names of Cities are mention'd in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46315:284"/>
the Pentateuch, and yet the Names were not given
till after <hi>Moses</hi>'s Death. In <hi>Ios.</hi> 4. 19. the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
are said to <hi>encamp in Gilgal,</hi> but that place is
called so by Anticipation, for it had that Name
afterwards, <hi>ch. 5. v.</hi> 9. And other Instances there
are of this nature in the Book of <hi>Ioshuah;</hi> the
Names of several places mentioned in it are of a
later Date than <hi>Ioshuah</hi>'s time. The Jews con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
is very probable that <hi>Ezra</hi> after the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
(when he collected the several parts of the
Bible, and set them in order) left out some of the
antient Names of Places, and inserted some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
ones; that is, he added the Names of Places
which were unknown, and not used in the days of
<hi>Moses</hi> or of others who writ those Books: whence
it is that we now read of the Names of Places
which were not given at that time when they are
mentioned, but are only by way of <hi>Anticipation</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
into the History.</p>
                     <p>Near of kin to this is <hi>Hysterosis,</hi> another Usual
Figure in Scripture, which is when the proper and
genuine Order of the Words is not kept. And
this is observable either in some single Words and
Verses, or in some Chapters. Of the former sort
is <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 1. where the Sons of <hi>Noah</hi> are reckoned
in this order, <hi>Shem, Ham</hi> and <hi>Iapheth;</hi> yet <hi>Iapheth</hi>
was the Eldest Brother. It is true <hi>Scaliger</hi> holds
the very order of the Generation which this Verse
sets down, and saith <hi>Shem</hi> was <hi>Noah</hi>'s First-born,
and <hi>Iapheth</hi> his youngest. But 'tis generally agreed
on by the Learned that this is not the right order:
for first, the Septuagint expresly say <hi>Iapheth was
the Elder Brother of</hi> Shem, <hi>v.</hi> 21. Again, <hi>Iosephus</hi>
in his<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 1. cap. 7.</note> Jewish Antiquities reckons them thus,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46315:285"/>
                        <hi>Iapheth</hi> the eldest Son, <hi>Cham</hi> the next, and <hi>She<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>
the youngest of all. Moreover, according to the
Chaldee Paraphrast, who is of good Repute, this
is the true Order. Lastly, you will find it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in the following Parts of this Chapter; the
Generations begin first with <hi>Iapheth,</hi> then pass to
<hi>Cham,</hi> and end with <hi>Shem.</hi> All which shews that
there is a <hi>Transposition</hi> in the first Verse, and that
the true ranking of them is not there kept. We
read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 26. that <hi>Terab begat</hi> Abram, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor,
<hi>and</hi> Haran; but the naming of <hi>Abram</hi> first of
the three Brethren, doth not prove that he was
eldest; but there is some Ground to believe that he
was not. And as the true Order of Words in some
<hi>Verses</hi> is not always exact, so neither is the true Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of History observ'd in some <hi>Chapters.</hi> Thus
in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. after God's <hi>resting on the seventh Day,</hi> v. 1.
you read of God's <hi>forming Man and Woman,</hi> v. 7.
&amp; 18. which was the Sixth Day's Work, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
according to the True Order of things should
have been part of the Contents of the First Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
So the <hi>Division of the Earth,</hi> which is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>Genesis,</hi> is set before the <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Tongues,</hi> spoken of in the <hi>11th</hi> Chapter,
notwithstanding this was before that, and was the
occasion of it. And some Instances of this Nature
are in those Historical Books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the <hi>Kings,</hi>
and <hi>Chronicles.</hi> The seventh and eighth Chapters
of <hi>Daniel</hi> are misplaced; they should of right have
been inserted before, <hi>viz.</hi> immediately after the
<hi>4th</hi> Chapter; for they speak of what happened in
<hi>Belshazzar</hi>'s time, although the foregoing Chapter
relates what was done by <hi>Darius</hi> after <hi>Belshazzar</hi>
was slain, and the Kingdom of <hi>Babylon</hi> became his.
And in many other Places of the Sacred Writings
there is a <hi>Transposing</hi> of things, and sometimes
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46315:285"/>
that is placed first which was done last To
which purpose the Hebrew Doctors have long
since pronounced, that <hi>there is neither Before nor Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Law.</hi> A<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Simon Crit. Hist. Book 1.</note> late Author tells us that the
Reason is, because the Books of the Pentateuch and
some others were written upon little Scrolls or
Sheets of Paper, not so well fastned together as
our Books now are, and so the Order of these
Scrolls was changed. But this is an upstart In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of this Gentleman's Brain, and hath no
Foundation but his own Fancy; for as he mistakes
<hi>Paper</hi> for <hi>Parchment,</hi> (there being perhaps no such
thing as the former in those Days) so he is mistaken
in his Conceit about <hi>fastning</hi> those Parchment-Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
together.</p>
                     <p>First, I say, he proceeds upon a wrong Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
because he asserts the antientest Books of the
Bible to have been written on <hi>Paper,</hi> whereas it
doth not appear that this Invention is so old: and
on the other side, there are undeniable Proofs of
the great Antiquity of <hi>Parchment,</hi> and that it was
made use of for Books to write upon. That which
hath occasioned some Learned Men (and 'tis likely
our present Author, who is most justly rank'd in
the Number of the Learned) to think otherwise,
was that Passage in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 13. c. 11.</note> Natural History, where
he reports that <hi>Ptolomee Philadelph,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
forbad the exporting of the <hi>Papyrus</hi> (of which Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
was made at that time) out of his Territories.
Whereupon <hi>Eumenes,</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> found
out another way of making Paper, of the inmost
<hi>Skins of Beasts,</hi> which was call'd <hi>Pergamena,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'twas invented in <hi>Pergamus</hi> first. But this
was a great Oversight of <hi>Pliny,</hi> for that was not
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46315:286"/>
the first Use of them; they were much antienter
than that time.<note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Diodorus</hi> the Sicilian tells us,

in which the Antientest Memorials of things
in the World were thought to be written. And
out of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> the great Father of History, he

                        <hi>many of the Barbarians write in such Skins.</hi> Now
we know who they were that the Pagans used to
call <hi>Barbarians, viz.</hi> the <hi>Iews;</hi> and therefore it is
probable these are meant here. It may have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their writing the Books of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Parchment.</hi> But if This, concerning the
particular Reference of these Words to the <hi>Iews,</hi>
be a Conjecture only, yet the other things which
have been suggested, are a clear and evident Proof
of the Antient Use of the <hi>Membrana,</hi> and we have
no reason to question that the Bible it self was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in it. That it was so, we learn from <hi>Iosephus,</hi>
who assures us, that <hi>Eleazar</hi> the High Priest sent
away the 72 Elders or Interpreters to <hi>Ptolomee,</hi> with
the Bible written in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ine Parchment; and he tells
us in<note n="‖" place="bottom">Antiq. Jud. l. 12. c. 2.</note> the same Place, (which is very remarkable,
and to our purpose) that <hi>King</hi> Ptolomee <hi>was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
to see the Parchments so fine and delicate, and to
observe the whole Form of them so exactly joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46315:286"/>
that no one could possibly discern where the Seams
were.</hi> From which Testimony of this Learned Jew
it is evident, that <hi>there was Parchment found out and
used in Writing before the time that</hi> Pliny <hi>talks of,</hi> i. e.
before <hi>Eumenes</hi>'s time. And as for this <hi>Eumenes,</hi>
(who is by some Writers also call'd <hi>Attalus,</hi> for it
appears plainly that 'tis the same Man, the same
King of <hi>Pergamus</hi>) he was not the Person that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
it, nor was it in his time invented; he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
procured a great Quantity of it to be made, and
so it became common in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia:</hi> whence
some (and <hi>Pliny</hi> among the rest) thought he was
the first Inventer of it. This was the Rise of the
Mistake: But the Truth of the Matter is this,
(which the Learnedest Men now agree to) that
Parchments which were made of Sheepskins dress'd,
were long before the Emulation between <hi>Ptolomee</hi>
and <hi>Eumenes,</hi> (who both at the same time were
ambitious to procure an Universal Library;) but
when this Quarrel arose, <hi>Ptolomee</hi> forbad Paper to
be sent out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereupon <hi>Eumences</hi> caused
Parchments to be made in greater Abundance than
before, that so there might be no need of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi>
Again, 'tis evident from this Testimony of
<hi>Iosephus,</hi> that the <hi>Books of the Old Testament were
written in Parchment.</hi> And seeing we have proved
that Parchment was long before, it is credible that
the Bible was copied out at first into it. That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial
Saying, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, shews the
great Antiquity of this sort of Writing-materials;
for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is <hi>Membrana,</hi> and it is also a Book
made of the same, which they of old used to write
in. I might take notice of the antient Practice of
the Jews, <hi>viz.</hi> their wearing of Phylacteries, which
were pieces of Scrolls of <hi>Parchment,</hi> whereon they
wrote some part of the Law, and bound it to their
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46315:287"/>
Heads and Hands: whence we may probably ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the Books of the Old Testament were
first of all <hi>Parchment-Writings;</hi> for the Jews were
strict Observers as well as Admirers of Antiquity,
and therefore their writing some Sentences of the
Law in Parchments shews that the Bible it self,
from whence they were taken, had been usually and
of old transcribed into those very Materials. Much
more might be said, but I will only add, that the
Jews <hi>Rolling up</hi> their Sacred Writings (whence their
Books were call'd <hi>Megilloth, Volumina)</hi> is a plain
Argument that they were not composed of <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Paper,</hi> which was thin and weak, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
was not capable of this <hi>Rolling.</hi> But a Long
and Broad Skin or Parchment would endure this
without tearing, and therefore it is not to be
doubted that this was made use of. The Sense of
which (besides the common Report and Notion
among the Jews) caused the Famous <hi>Rabbi Ionathan</hi>
to say in his <hi>Targum</hi> on <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 24. that <hi>Moses
writ the Law upon Parchment:</hi> Which shews, that it
was the Opinion of the Learned Jews, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
was originally written in Parchment, not on
Paper. And the <hi>Talmud</hi> often mentions this
Parchment-Writing as a known thing. It is ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
then to believe and assert, that these Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
were written in Parchment: and though we
are informed from sufficient Authors, that other
Materials of old were used, as the Egyptian <hi>Papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
Leaves,</hi> as also the <hi>Inward Bark or Coat of
Trees,</hi> &amp;c. when they wrote but few Words, yet
<hi>Parchment</hi> was the old and usual Matter on which
they wrote when they had occasion to compose a
whole Book: which confutes <hi>F. Simon</hi>'s Notion,
that the Old Testament was written in Paper;
which, upon serious Reflection, so searching a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46315:287"/>
as he is cannot but discern to be a Mistake: and
he knows that <hi>Charta,</hi> Writing-Paper was not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
used till <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great's time, as
<note n="*" place="bottom">Nar. Hist, l. 13. c. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Pliny</hi> himself acknowledges, who quotes <hi>Varro</hi> for
this, that the first use of Paper, made of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex
of the Egyptian Papyrus, was found out in
<hi>Egypt</hi> in that Monarch's Reign; and that before
that time they wrote upon Leaves of Trees, on
Wax, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Then in the next Place, it were easy to disprove
this Ingenious Author's Conceit about the <hi>fastning,</hi>
or, rather as he would have it, the <hi>not fastning</hi> of
these Parchments together, whence he fancies it
was that the Transposition and Misplacing of some
Parts of the Bible happened. He tells us, that
heretofore they wrote upon Sheets or Leaves rolled
together one over another, round a piece of Wood:
and these being not well joined together, there was
sometimes a misplacing of what was written in
them, because their Order was altered. This may
be partly true, and I cannot deny that it so happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sometimes, that is, when there was no Care
taken to sow, or other ways to fasten the Leaves or
Sheets to the Stick of Wood about which they were
rolled, or to one another. But it was not so in the
present Case; for you may be sure that they took
all the Care imaginable to secure the Order of the
Sheets, and they were not destitute of a particular
way of doing it; so that their Books were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
fastned. But if he means that they were not
<hi>bound</hi> as our Books are now a days, then his new
Discovery is only this, that the Trade of Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binding
was not set up in <hi>Moses</hi> or <hi>Ezra</hi>'s Days.
Or, if he means that the written Sheets and Scrolls
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:46315:288"/>
were loose, and not well tack'd together, he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
speaks against his own knowledg of this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for he knows very well that the Jews wrote in
Rolls or continued Sheets or Skins, which were not
liable to be separated, as our Writings are now.
He is Antiquary enough to confute himself from
what he hath read concerning their manner of
making their Books or Volumes, their fixing the
Sheets of Parchment at one end, by sowing or
fastning the first Sheet between two Sticks or
Pieces of Wood, their joining the several Sheets
together, (as appears from the forecited Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Jewish Historian, who saith, the <hi>Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in which the Bible was written, were so closely and
firmly joined together, that 'twas not possible to discern
the Seams or Places where they were joined</hi>) their
Rolling them up close, and their keeping them in
safe Repositories, (for they had places on purpose
for all Valuable Books) so that it was not likely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yea scarcely possible, that any of these Scrolls or
Sheets (which were not <hi>little ones,</hi> as he suggests,
but of a considerable size) should be <hi>put out of their
places,</hi> much less <hi>lost:</hi> for he goes so far as to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
that many of these Scrolls were embezzel'd
and lost, and thence the Scriptures of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
are so maimed and imperfect. But we
know the Man and his Design, which is to depreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and vilify the Scriptures, thereby to advance
the Credit of <hi>Tradition,</hi> and by that means to exalt
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (though this is not so forward
to exalt him): This was it which made him give us
this Specimen of his Wit and Invention (of which,
it must be confessed, he hath no small Stock); this
made him attempt by these <hi>Paper-Proofs</hi> to lessen
the Authority of the Bible: Otherwise it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
this <hi>Parisian Critick</hi> is a Person of great Worth
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46315:288"/>
and Learning; and it is his singular Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that he is no Furious Bigot, but is Moderate and
Discreet in many things, and is one that dotes not
on the Opinions and Assertions of the Catholick
Doctors. But if you would know the true Reason
or Occasion of that <hi>Transposition</hi> which you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
meet with in the Holy Writings, not only of
the Old but New Testament, it is chiefly this as
I conceive; The Holy Writers study not Exactness,
they are more intent upon the Thing and Matter
which they write, than upon the due Order and
Marshalling of it: they are not Nice and Accurate
in giving every Occurrence or Event its right
Place; whence it is that you meet with some things
in these Writings that are transposed and out of
Order: and it is left to the Diligent and Inquisitive
Reader to amend and reform tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>There are not only Grammatical but Rhetorical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
in the Sacred Volume. The Psalmist's Words,
Psal. 120. 5. are Hyperbolical, though not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
interpreted to be such. So are our Saviour's
Words, Matth. 13. 32. though commonly expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
otherwise. Luke 19. 44. rejected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> form being Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical.
John 21. 25. proved to be an Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole.
This way of speaking in Scripture is no Lie.
Ironies are frequent in this Holy Book, of which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Examples are produced. Luke 22. 36: is
shew'd to be of this sort. And so is Acts 23. 5. I
wist not that he was the High Priest. This man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of speaking is not unworthy of the Sacred Penmen:
Synecdoches frequent in Scripture; proved from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Instances; Metaphors also common. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon's
Metaphorical Description of Old Age in
Eccles. 12. expounded in all its Parts.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere are not only <hi>Grammatical</hi> but <hi>Rhetorical
Figures</hi> in this Sacred Volume, the chief of
which I will briefly speak of, not to say that
I have mentioned some of them already. And
though (as I said of the former) they have been
observed by several Writers, yet one Reason why
I mention them here is, because I shall have occasion
to reduce some Texts to these Figures which have
not been so interpreted by other Authors. First,
<hi>Hyperboles</hi> are not unusual in these Holy Writings;
these are such Speeches as seem to surpass the bare
Truth, either by augmenting or diminishing it.
Thus a <hi>Great Caldron,</hi> one of the Vessels of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46315:289"/>
that held a vast Quantity of Water, is call'd
a <hi>Sea, a molten Sea,</hi> 1 Kings 7. 23. a <hi>brazen Sea,
2 Kings.</hi> 25. 13. It is said, that <hi>the Cities were walled
up to Heaven,</hi> Deut. 1. 28. and that <hi>Solomon made.
Silver in</hi> Jerusalem <hi>as Stones,</hi> 1 Kings 10. 27. and
that at his being anointed King <hi>the People rejoiced
with great Ioy, so that the Earth rent with the Sound of
them,</hi> 1 Kings 1. 40. Upon which Places, and
some others, the Jews found that Saying of theirs,
<hi>The Law sometimes speaks Hyperbolically.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of <hi>Behemoth</hi> is full of this sort of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
<hi>He moveth his Tail like a Cedar; his Bones
are as strong pieces of Brass, and Bars of Iron; he
drinketh up a River, he trusteth that he can draw up</hi> Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan
<hi>into his Mouth,</hi> Job 40. 17, &amp;c. <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
was said<note n="*" place="bottom">Diodor. Sic. l. 11. Juvenal. Sat. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>to drink whole Rivers dry,</hi> in that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical
Sense in which this is spoken of <hi>Behemoth:</hi>
which proves what I have asserted, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
symbolizeth with other Writers, or rather
they with it. The like Hyperbolical Description
you have of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> Job 41. 18, to the end.
And such is that of the <hi>Locusts,</hi> Joel 2. 2—12.
all which is indeed one Continued Hyperbole,
wherein he elegantly and pathetically describes
them as a well-formed <hi>Army,</hi> as <hi>Virgil</hi> in his <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks</hi>
loftily doth the <hi>Ants, It nigrum campis agmen.</hi>
So all is Poetical and Hyperbolical in <hi>Psal.</hi> 18.
7—16. As for <hi>Psal. 120. 5. Wo is me that I so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ
in</hi> Mesech, <hi>and dwell in the Tents of</hi> Kedar;
few Expositors take it to be of this kind. Becaus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                        <hi>Mesech</hi> signifies <hi>protracting</hi> or <hi>prolonging,</hi> some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
the first Clause thus, <hi>I have a LONG time
dwelt:</hi> and because <hi>Kedar</hi> signifies <hi>Blackness,</hi> they
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46315:290"/>
understand it of the Sadness of his Condition. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would translate the pious King to those Places
and Countries which bear the Name of <hi>Mesech</hi> and
<hi>Kedar,</hi> thinking that he was for some time confined
to those Places. And there are other Conjectures
about the Words, but the true Import of them in
my. Apprehension is this; <hi>David</hi> being banished
from home, expresseth it as if he were among the

of <hi>Arabia.</hi> Or, if you take <hi>Mesech</hi> and <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi>
to be both of them in <hi>Arabia,</hi> (as some do)
then still the Sense is the same; I sojourn, I dwell,
I inhabit among the inhospitable People of <hi>Arabia,</hi>
call'd <hi>Scenitae,</hi> because they lived in Tents, or in
that part of the Wilderness where the Israelites

fallen, and with whom he was forced to converse
at that time. To this sort of Speech we may refer

I grant is not reckoned by Writers among the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles
of Scripture, but I appeal to the Learned,
whether it ought not. Of the <hi>Mustard-seed</hi> there
in the Parable Christ saith, <hi>It is indeed the least of

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

that a thousand of them make not above one single

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rtainly is a Seed of
the least size that is. And<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Ray</hi>'s Wisdom of God in the Creation, <hi>p.</hi> 100.</note> another reckons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>smallest</hi> Seeds of Plants those of Reed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mace,
and of Harts-tongue, and of some sorts of
Mosses and Ferns. And of these latter I have read
that some of them are so small, that they cannot
be seen without the Help of a Microscope. But our
Saviour, to set forth and magnify the wonderful
Power of the Word of God, and the Increasing
and Spreading of his Kingdom, though from very
small Beginnings, compares them to <hi>a Grain of
Mustard-seed;</hi> and by a Lessening Hyperbole calls
this <hi>the Least of all Seeds,</hi> though in exact speaking
it be not so. But if this way of interpreting Christ's
Words, which I now offer, be not approved of,
then you may expound them thus, that this Seed is
<hi>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

them spoken Respectively, that is, it is the Least
of all such Seeds as extend to large Productions;
no Seed so little sendeth forth Branches so wide,
or bringeth forth its Fruit after that plentiful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Thus you may understand the Words, but in
my Judgment the resolving them into an <hi>Hyperbole</hi>
is the best way, though it be not made use <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>f by
Expositors. And how indeed could it, when they
took the <hi>Seed of Mustard</hi> to be Absolutely the least
of all Grains whatsoever? That of our Saviour in
Luke 19. 44. <hi>They shall not leave in thee one Stone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another;</hi> which is spoken of the Last and Final
Devastation of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is generally supposed
to be an <hi>Hyperbolical</hi> Expression, and consequently
not true in Strictness of Speech: for can we think,
say some, that the Roman Armies had nothing else
to do but to pick out all the Stones in the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and throw them away? Those who talk thus,
do not remember what was done at several times
towards the compleat and total Destruction of that
Place. This Passage of our Blessed Lord seems to
refer particularly and signally to the digging up the
Foundations of the City and Temple, and the very
ploughing up the Ground by <hi>Titus</hi>'s Command,
(which the Jews themselves do not deny) and also
to that Prodigious Earthquake in <hi>Iulian</hi>'s time,

St. <hi>Iohn</hi> had a mind to conclude his Book
with some Great Word concerning his Dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

told you. What he said and did was so Great and
so Admirable, that Innumerable Volumes might
be filled with enlarging on that copious Matter. I
may say to you, <hi>the Whole World,</hi> as wide and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

be written in relating all the Passages that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd

them. Observ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> it, the Evangelist saith, the <hi>World
it self, i. e.</hi> this Material Local World, therefore
it cann't be understood of the <hi>Men</hi> of the world,
as those of the former Opinions fancied. Besides,
it is observable that he speaks not Absolutely here,
but in a Qualified Manner; <hi>I suppose,</hi> I think, I
conceive <hi>the World it self cannot contain,</hi> &amp;c. which
plainly shews that the Words cannot be meant in
the former Senses. For what Sense can you make
of this; <hi>I suppose, I think that all the Men in the
World cannot comprehend the Books which should be
written;</hi> or, <hi>I suppose all the Men in the World cannot
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46315:292"/>
entertain and approve of them?</hi> Whether he supposed
it or not, it would be so: and this is a thing not to
be supposed, but really believed and directly assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if it be true. But if you admit of the plain
Sense of the Words, which I have propounded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
then his <hi>supposing</hi> may be very pertinent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ent
here; for it is but a kind of a <hi>Supposition.</hi>
not an Exact and Strict Truth which he here utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
it is a Lofty Strain or Hyperbole, which he
shuts up his Gospel with; I think in a manner,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aith he, that the <hi>Whole World</hi> it self cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Books that might be composed and written
on this Glorious Theme, which is so Various, so
Voluminous. Thus you see the Words must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
in this way, for the others are not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable
to good Sense. And indeed this manner of
Stile is but parallel with other Passages in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as <hi>Gen. 13. 6. The Land was not able <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>o bear
them,</hi> viz. <hi>Lot</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and their Flocks;
which expresses how exceeding Numerous they
were. So <hi>some</hi> understand <hi>Luke 2. 1. There went
out a Decree that all the World should be taxed:</hi> which
sets forth the Largeness and Vast Extent of the
Emperor's Dominions; not that all the World
(strictly speaking) was to be tax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, for 'twas not
all in his Power. It was said of our Saviour, <hi>The
World is gone after him,</hi> John 12. 19. which only
expresses the Vast Numbers of People that flock'd
to him wheresoever he went. Such is the Stile
here, <hi>The World it self cannot contain,</hi> &amp;c. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists
and Apostles must in a manner have fill'd
the World with their Writings concerning Christ;
the Books would have been so Numerous, that
even the Whole World could scarcely have held
them, that is, in plainer terms, there must have
been an Incredible Number of Books to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:46315:293"/>
all those Matters. There are many other
Instances of this Hyperbolical Manner of speaking
in the Holy Writings, but my Design is only to
give you a Taste of these and the like Figurative
Expressions, in order to your being better acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Stile of Scripture. There is a<note n="‖" place="bottom">Paraeus in Comment. in Epist. ad Roman. &amp; Corinth.</note> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Modern Divine, who thinks there is no such
thing as an <hi>Hyperbole</hi> in Scripture; he will by no
means grant that this way of speaking is to be found
in the Sacred Writings, because it is <hi>a kind of Lie.</hi>
But all that is to be said in answer to him, is this,
that it is impossible to give any other Account of
some of the forenamed Instances, and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
than by resolving them into an Hyperbole;
which is no <hi>Lie,</hi> nor <hi>a kind</hi> of one, because it is
not contrary to the Mind of him that speaks it, nor
is it spoken to impose upon them that hear it. Yet
it is to be granted, that there is a Moderation to
be observed by us, as there is in Scripture, in using
this sort of speaking. You meet with but few Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles
in the Holy Writers; and as they are rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sparingly used, so it is done in a fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Subject; and where there is no likelihood
of their degenerating into a Lie; and where the
Story or other subject Matter is not thereby falsly
misrepresented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But it is otherwise where Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
immoderately affect an Hyperbolick Strain,
for they make use of it in Matters where it is not fit
to be used, and where the Truth and Reality of the
Subject are endangered, and where it administers
to Falshood, Thus it is in the Poems of that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical
Poet <hi>Lucan,</hi> who is a Prodigious and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable
Hyperbolizer. And thus it is in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>Balsac:</hi> An Extravagant Hyperbole goes all
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46315:293"/>
along through his Letters, though to the Greatest
Persons, and Men of profess'd Gravity. A great
Fault certainly it is in those Ingenious Pieces of
his. But there is no such thing in the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
there is nothing there Romantick and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant;
the Hyperbole is seldom used, and
when it is, it is Modest and Becoming, Fit and
Convenient, and doth not in the least administer
to Levity, or impair and endamage the Truth.</p>
                     <p>Again; in this Holy Book, as well as in Other
Writings, there is that sort of Speaking which is
call'd an <hi>Irony, i. e.</hi> when something is said in way
of Derision or Scoff, contrary to what is meant;
as in that commonly observed Place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22.
<hi>Behold! the Man is become as one of us, to know Good
and Evil:</hi> which refers to Satan's Words to <hi>Adam,
Ye shall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil,</hi> ver. 5.
And so Man is here upbraided with his Belief of
the Devil before the God of Truth. Look you
now, is not Man become a God? Yes, this mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears indeed from what hath befallen him;
he hath lost the Divine Image wherein he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and is become a Wretched Sinner and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.
Is not this Creature then <hi>become as one of us?</hi>
or, now<note n="*" place="bottom">Hajah, <hi>suit.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>he hath been as one of us;</hi> he hath already
experienced what it is to be like <hi>God:</hi> Hath he
not? Thus he is justly derided for his wilful Folly
by the Sacred Trinity. And if they think fit to
speak after this manner, it will not unbecome the
Sons of Men. This Ironical way of speaking you
meet with in 1 <hi>Kings 18. 27. Cry aloud, for he</hi> (that
is, <hi>Baal) is a God:</hi> either he <hi>is talking, or he is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing,
or he is on a Iourney, or peradventure he sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and must be awaked.</hi> Thus the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:46315:294"/>
mocks those deluded Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
pleasant with them. Even Grave and Austere
<hi>Elijab</hi> laughs at the <hi>Baalites</hi> invoking of a Deaf Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
he plays upon their serious but idolatrous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.
Whence I gather, that it is not light and
unbecoming to scoff at Superstition, and jeer Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.
Those Words of the Prophet <hi>Micaiah</hi> to
King <hi>Abab,</hi> 1 Kings 22. 15. <hi>Go and prosper,</hi> are a
plain Ironical Concession. In this Sense those
Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ds are to be understood, <hi>Iob 5. 1. Call now, if
there be any that will answer thee: and to which of the
Saints will thou turn?</hi> And <hi>chap. 12. 2. No doubt but
ye are the People, and Wisdom shall die with you.</hi> And
that of <hi>Solomon</hi> to the Youthful Sinner, <hi>Rejoice, O
young Man, in thy Youth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 9. Which
manner of speaking is more particularly suted here
to the Humour and Genius of the <hi>Young Man,</hi> whose
Fashion is immoderately to scoff, and to entertain
himself and others with Pleasantry and Drollery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But that he might see that this was intended as a
Rebuke to him, and that he might be sure that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
was serious and in good earnest, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this way of speaking, 'tis added in the
Close of the Verse, <hi>Know that for all these things
God will bring thee to Iudgment:</hi> And he that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that will have no Reason to <hi>rejoice, i. e.</hi> to be
loose and inordinate in his Mirth, but rather to be
sober and retired, and to be preparing for Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to set about so great a Task betimes,
and not fondly presume on Health, and Length of
Days. No Man need question whether those
Words of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> ch. 8. 9. <hi>Associate your selves, O
ye People,</hi> be not spoken Ironically: (which are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
with <hi>Ioel 3. 11. Assemble your selves, and come
all ye Heathen, and gather your selves round about,</hi>
&amp;c.) And those in <hi>Isa. 50. 11. Walk in the Light of

your Fire, and in the Sparks that you have kindled,</hi> i. e.

                        </hi>
that give a short Light, and soon vanish. That is a
terrible Biting Taunt in <hi>Ier. 22. 23. How gracious
shalt thou be when Pangs come upon thee, the Pain as of
a Woman in Travail?</hi> And so is that other, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.
21: <hi>Rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of</hi> Edom, <hi>the

Who doubts whether <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 39. be not Sarcasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal?
<hi>Thus faith the Lord God, Go ye, serve ye every

reckon'd as spoken Ironically; <hi>Now gather thy self
in Troops, O Daughter of Troops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> O <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
come and do your worst, with your joint
Forces invade us, and most severely treat our
Prince and People; yea, by all means destroy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate,
and even annihilate the Church of God:
whereas the Prophet, who speaks this, intimates
in the whole Chapter afterwards, that the Church
shall flourish, and that it shall be impossible for its
Enemies to do it harm. So that in <hi>Nah.</hi> 3. 14.
<hi>Draw thee Waters for the Siege, fortify thy strong Holds,</hi>
is said in way of Derision to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> whose una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
Ruine is foretold in that Chapter.</p>
                     <p>And besides many such Sarcasms in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ament,
there are several in the New, as that of
our Blessed Lord to his drowzy Disciples, <hi>Sleep on
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ow, and take your Rest,</hi> Matth. 26. 45. This is a
downright Irony, because Christ here intends a
different thing, nay contrary to what he saith: His
meaning is, not that they should sleep, when both
he and they were in so great Danger, but his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
rather was, that they should <hi>watch and pray,</hi> as
you read, <hi>ver.</hi> 41. By this way of speaking he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46315:295"/>
corrects them for their unseasonable Drowsiness,
that they could not watch at such a time as that,
when he had just before foretold them that he was
to be betrayed. That is another clear Text, <hi>Full
well</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>fairly,</hi> as Sir <hi>Nort. Knatchbull</hi> renders
it) <hi>ye reject the Commandment of God,</hi> saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to the Pharisees, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 9. Ye do very well
and laudably in preferring the Traditions and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of Men before the express Commands of
God. This is a commendable piece of Religion
indeed: Is it not? Do you think that this will be
acceptable to God? There is another Passage of our
Saviour which seems to me to be perfectly Ironical,
though Commentators generally carry the Sense
another way: <hi>But now</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>he that hath a
Purse, let him take it, and likewise his Scrip: and be
that hath no Sword, let him sell his Garment, and buy
one,</hi> Luke 22. 36. Which is thought by Expositors
to be a plain and direct Exhortation to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to furnish themselves with Money, Provision,
and Swords. But this cannot be meant here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
1. Christ had declared against Fighting,
for he tells <hi>Pilate, (Iohn</hi> 18. 36.) that <hi>if his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
were of this World, then would his Servants</hi> (i. e.
his Apostles and Disciples) <hi>fight, that he should not
be delivered to the Iews.</hi> Swords then were to no
purpose. 2. When they brought two Swords to
him, his Answer is observable, <hi>It is enough.</hi> If he
had meant <hi>real Swords,</hi> he would not have said that
two of them were <hi>enough,</hi> for those could serve
but two Men: They should all of them be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with that sort of Weapons, and have stood on
their Guard. When therefore he saith, <hi>It is enough,</hi>
he doth as good as say, I do not mean Carnal Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons:
You mistake me, as you have often done,
and dream of a Temporal Kingdom of the Messias.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46315:295"/>
3. It is evident that Christ meant not <hi>Swords</hi> in the
usual Signification of the Word, because after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
he sharply blamed <hi>Peter</hi> for making use of
this Weapon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 52. It appears that he
had no Commission from our Saviour to draw his
Sword. I cannot therefore subscribe to those who
interpret these Words of our Lord in the direct and
obvious Sense. But if we understand them to be
spoken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ronically, they are very intelligible, and
are consistent with what Christ saith at other
times. And let no Man wonder that our Blessed
Master uses this sort of Stile here, for I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you before, in two undeniable Instances, that
he made use of it, yea even when he was approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Death, as when he said to his Apostles,
<hi>Sleep on, and take your Rest.</hi> And so he speaks after
the same manner here, upbraiding his Apostles,
who he knew were afraid of Suffering, and had so
often been talking of Christ's Kingdom on Earth,
and of the Prosperous Times that were to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
it. He now in a Sarcastick way chastises their
fond and groundless Conceit, and bids them <hi>go and
buy Swords,</hi> and lay in Provisions. If you are for
a Temporal Reign, saith he, then sight for it. You
are specially well skill'd in your Weapons without
doubt, you are excellent Sword-men. This I take
to be the Sense of the Words: and truly a Man
might gather it from that one Passage before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
<hi>It is enough,</hi> said our Saviour to them,
when they brought him a couple of Swords. This
it self is an Ironick Quip; it is as if he had said,
This is brave Armour indeed! Now you are well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
surely. You are like to defend me and
your selves against all that come against us. Two
Swords amongst you all are a very great Armory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
This plainly shews what our Saviour's meaning
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46315:296"/>
was, when he bid them <hi>buy Swords,</hi> he handsomly
check'd them for their Cowardice and Fear of Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.
But yet I will not deny that something
more may be included and comprized in these
Words: he bids them make the best Provision
they can against the Calamitous Times that were
coming: he exhorts them to be provided with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Weapons, Faith and Patience, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Sword
of the Spirit, yea with the Whole Armour of God.
This higher and spiritual meaning may be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in what Christ here uttereth. But if you take
the Words as they sound, and in the more direct
and literal Tendency of them, I do not see that
they can be interpreted in a better way than I have
offered.</p>
                     <p>And as our Blessed Saviour himself, so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
St. <hi>Paul</hi> sometimes uses this Figure which I am
now speaking of. I am enclined to think that
those Words in <hi>Acts 23. 5. I wist not that he was the
High Priest,</hi> are to be taken in this Sense: He makes
use of an Irony, and is to be understood as if he
had said, Is this the High Priest? Alas, I did not
know that this was that Reverend Gentleman. I
should have shewed my self more civil to him, if I
had been acquainted that this was that Worshipful
Man, that Gay Pontiff to whom you pay so great
Veneration: But who would take this Person to be
the High Priest, the Great Leading Officer of the
Church, who is to be an Example of Mildness and
Gentleness to all Men? His furious way of speaking
and acting towards me, doth not discover him to
be one of that High Character and Order: He doth
not shew himself to be a Spiritual Man: Surely
this cannot be He: This Behaviour speaks him to
be another Person. So it is spoken in a jtering

may think) too light and jocular for the Apostle,
though he was before the Sanhedrim, the most
Grave and Solemn Council of that Nation: For in
several of the Instances before mentioned, we see
this way of speaking hath been made use of before
very Great and Venerable Persons, and in Causes
that were exceeding Serious and Weighty. And
whereas the Apostle immediately adds, <hi>For it is
written, Thou shalt not speak Evil of the Ruler of thy
People;</hi> which may make it seem incredible that St.
<hi>Paul</hi> spoke in a Sarcastick way, which is speaking
one thing, and meaning another: for is it likely he
would back this with a serious Text of Scripture?
I answer, It is likely, for hereby he lets them see,
that there is Substantial and Real Truth at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of this Sarcasm. He lets them know, that he
is very Grave and in good earnest whilst he speaks
to them after an Ironick rate: You are, saith he,
very well vers'd in Scripture, I know; You are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to quote that Place against me in <hi>Exodus, Thou
shalt not speak Evil of the Ruler of the People.</hi> This
it is, Sirs, to be so well skill'd in the Law, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be very Good People certainly, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
you must be very Obedient to your Rulers,
and are never heard to use any irreverent Language
towards them. It is therefore an unpardonable
Crime in me that I call'd your High Priest (your
Painted Piece of Justice) a <hi>Whited Wall.</hi> Yea, 'tis
an unsufferable Fault not to know that this Person
(among all those that sit on this Reverend Bench)
was the <hi>High Priest,</hi> especially when there are two
of them at a time. O! by all means every Man
and Woman is bound to know that this individual
Person is the Jewish Pope, the Supreme and Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

not know that this was the Prince of this Reverend
Senate, even this Worthy Gentleman, this simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal
Merchant that bought his Place of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Governour? How should I understand that
this Person is my <hi>Iudg</hi> at this time? This, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
may be the meaning of the Apostle's Words:
he prudently orders them, and jirks his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
but with Safety to himself. And this <hi>Ironical</hi>
way seems the rather to be that which the Apostle
here chooseth, because you presently find (in the
next Verses) that he pursues this prudential way of
speaking, and <hi>cries out in the Council, Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
I am a Pharisee,</hi> though he was none at that
time; only he held the Doctrine of the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which the Pharisees maintain'd, and so might
be said to be of that Sect, if of any. But there is
an <hi>Ironical</hi> Strain in it, and so his Discourse is all of
a piece. This is the Apprehension which I have of
these Words, but I am not very forward to urge
it upon any; only I will say this, that I had not
pitch'd upon this Interpretation, if some of those
that are usually propounded had not displeased me.
This Sense of the Words is certainly preferable to
that of <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> who tells us in plain terms,
that the Apostle<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <hi>dissembled.</hi> And St. <hi>Ierom</hi>
blames him for his Conduct in this Business. Nor
is there any Ground (so far as I see) for Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi>'s
Account of these Words, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
meaning of them is either, 1. That St. <hi>Paul</hi> owns
not <hi>Ananias</hi> for a lawful High Priest. Or, 2. He
owns not any lawful High Priesthood now, <hi>Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi>
being an Usurper, getting the Place by Money
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>raud. For though all this is true, yet it is
utterly inconsistent with what follows; <hi>for it is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46315:297"/>
written, Thou shalt not speak Evil of,</hi> &amp;c. where
there is an Acknowledgment of his being the <hi>Ruler
of the People.</hi> Besides, <hi>I wist not,</hi> and <hi>I own him not
to be the High Priest,</hi> are two different things: So
that this cannot be the right Import of the Words.
Others therefore say, the Apostle is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in the most plain and obvious Signification,
<hi>viz.</hi> that he really <hi>knew not</hi> that <hi>Ananias</hi> was the
High Priest, because it is probable, say they, this
Great Man appear'd not at that time in his Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
Habit, coming to the Council perhaps in haste,
which might incline the Apostle to think it was not
He who sat there to judg him. But no Man can
prove that the High Priest came to the Sanhedrim
in haste, or that he was not in his Robes proper to
his Office; and therefore this Answer is not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory.
But they tell us, that in those Days there
were two High Priests, one bought the Place, and
the other executed the Office; therefore it was no
easy Matter to know which of the two was the
High Priest indeed, which made St. <hi>Paul</hi> profess
before the Council, that <hi>he wist not</hi> that the Person
who commanded him to be smitten on the Mouth,
was the High Priest. If he had known him (say
they) to be Him, he would not have spoken as he
did of this Great Ruler of the People. But grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there were two High Priests at that time, yet
it is likely that one (who executed the Office) was
distinguish'd from the other in some manner that
was easily discernible: So that St. <hi>Paul</hi> could not
pretend he had no notice of him. However, St.
<hi>Paul</hi> knew that this very Person who ordered him
to be smitten, was one of his <hi>Iudges,</hi> (for he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
saith, that <hi>he sat there to judg him after the
Law</hi>) and on that account was a <hi>Ruler,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
he was not to speak Evil of him, much less
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46315:298"/>
to curse him, for he was not to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any, as himself acknowledgeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 14.
This Interpretation therefore is not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But if the Sense which I have before offered
be disliked, then I know no other but this, that
when St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>he wist not that he was the High
Priest;</hi> the meaning is, that <hi>he remembered not, he
considered not</hi> that he was such a Person, and so was
unawares surprized and precipitated into Passion,
and spoke unbecomingly of this Great Man. It
was want of Considering and Attending that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
him to that passionate and unseemly Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
or, being moved and exasperated, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e did
not consider that he was before so Great a Person.
This is no improbable Interpretation, if you can
be sure that these two Words, <hi>to know</hi> and <hi>to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
are sometimes equivalent in the Stile of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But if you cannot satisfy your selves as to
this, I think you may safely recur to the first Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
and look upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Words as an
<hi>Ironical</hi> Speech, especially if you consider that his
Stile is very full of them.</p>

which alas are nothing in comparison of
what your famous Teachers and new Evangelists
may glory in, and value themselves upon. But
then in the following Verses he leaves off (and
'twas time to do so) this looser sort of Stile, and
in a plain and close manner vindicates his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Dignity by vying with those bragging Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors,
<hi>Are they Hebrews? so am I,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

he had said, Yes indeed you Men of <hi>Corinth</hi> are a
civil easy sort of People; if a new upstart Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
should bring another Gospel to you, you
would do very well to receive him and bid him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
Thus he in an Illusory kind of way rebukes
their shameful Inconstancy and Levity. In the
same Vein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is that in 2. <hi>Cor. 12. 13. Forgive me this
wrong.</hi> He had told them in the same Verse, that
<hi>they were inferiour to no Churches in any thing, i. e.</hi> in
any Privileges or Excellencies whatsoever, <hi>except it

he put them to no Charges for his Preaching, he
preach'd the Gospel <hi>gratis:</hi> For which great
Wrong and Injury done to them he hopes, he saith,
they will pardon him. A very smart and pleasant
Irony. Thus it appears, that this Figurative way
of Speech is frequent in the Holy Writings. Some
perhaps would scarcely believe that there are so
many <hi>Ironical</hi> Passages in this Holy Book; they may
think it is below the Gravity of the Sacred Stile to
use Expressions of this kind: But herein they are
mistaken, for the Holy Spirit in the Scriptures uses
several different ways of dealing with Mankind,
and sutes himself to the various Dispositions, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius's
and Inclinations of Men: and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other ways of Address and Application he

A Man may laugh and speak Truth at the same

Very excellent things may be suggested in a

of the Holy Ghost, it is not unbecoming the
Gravity and Seriousness of the Holy Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
and even Christ himself, to use this nipping
sort of Raillery sometimes.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Synecdoche</hi> is another common Figure in the
Holy Writings, whereby the Whole is mentioned
instead of a Part, and a Part instead of the Whole.
Of the former, which is but rare, there are some
Instances in <hi>Glassius,</hi> and such other Writers as
treat of the Grammatical and Rhetorical Part of
the Bible, which the Reader may consult if he
please. Of the latter (which is most observable)
there are various kinds, but it will be sufficient to
mention these which follow. Sometimes the <hi>Soul,</hi>
which is but one half of Man, is put for the whole
Person: <hi>All the Souls that came with</hi> Jacob <hi>into</hi> Egypt
<hi>were threescore and ten,</hi> Gen. 46. 26. <hi>i. e.</hi> so many
Men and Women came with him: And there are
abundant Examples of this sort, both in the Old
and New Testament. Sometimes the other Moie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the <hi>Body,</hi> is expressive of the Whole Man, as
<hi>Rom. 12. 1. Present your Bodies (i. e.</hi> your selves)
<hi>a living Sacrifice.</hi> And <hi>Phil. 1. 20. Christ shall be
magnified in my Body, i. e.</hi> by me, my whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
There is another Text which I will name,
<hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. wherein there is this kind of <hi>Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,</hi>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:46315:300"/>
though I find not that it is observed by those
that comment on it: <hi>Take heed to your selves lest at
any time your Hearts be overcharg'd with Surf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Drunkenness, and Cares of this Life;</hi> your Hearts,
<hi>i. e.</hi> your selves. It must be meant of the Whole
Man, Body and Soul, because not only <hi>Surfeiting</hi>
and <hi>Drunkenness</hi> (which belong to the Body only)
but <hi>Cares of this life</hi> (which belong to the Soul and
Mind) are expresly mentioned. Again, <hi>some Parts
of the World</hi> are mentioned for the <hi>whole,</hi> as in
<hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

and from the West Country, i. e.</hi> from all Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Parts of the World. And in other Places
two or three of the Cardinal Points stand for them
all. To the Synecdochical way of speaking belongs
the using of an Even Number for an Odd one; or
a Round Number for one that is lesser or greater.
So<note n="*" place="bottom">Cunaeus, Jac. Capellus, Beroaldus, &amp;c.</note> some think the Year of <hi>Iubilee</hi> is call'd the
<hi>Fiftieth Year,</hi> Lev. 25. 10. meerly for the Evenness
or Roundness of the Number, and not because full
Fifty Years go to every Jubilee; for they hold that
Forty nine Years make a Jubilee, or rather that the
forty ninth Year is the Year of Jubilee. And truly
it is adjusted to Reason and the Discovery we have
concerning this Matter: for the <hi>Jubilee</hi> is the Great
Sabbath of Years, and is composed of seven times
seven Years, which is exactly forty nine, the last
of which is the Jubilaean Year. Odd Numbers are
not regarded sometimes. The Scripture is not so
minute and critical as always to reckon preci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ely.
It is not unusual to omit a small Number of Years
in a greater and bigger one. In <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 24.
the <hi>Elders</hi> are said to be <hi>seventy,</hi> though two of the
Number be wanting, as is plain from <hi>ver.</hi> 26. But
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46315:300"/>
others solve this by saying, the full Number of
them was <hi>seventy two.</hi> It is recorded that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian
King reigned over <hi>a hundred and twenty seven
Provinees,</hi> E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>th. 1. 1. But in <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 1. the odd
Number <hi>seven</hi> is omitted, and so in other Places
the imperfect Number is left out. Some Parts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Twelve Tribes are call'd the Twelve
Tribes; <hi>Acts 26. 7. Our twelve Tribes instantly
serving God Day and Night.</hi> And St. <hi>Iames</hi> directs
his Epistle to the <hi>Twelve Tribes,</hi> whether there were
that Number extant at that time or not. So a
Round Number is used for an odd one in <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.
24. where <hi>Thomas</hi> is call'd <hi>one of the Twelve:</hi> yet
there were but Eleven Apostles then. But because
the Number of the Apostles was twelve before <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>'s
Apostacy; and afterwards, when <hi>Matthias</hi>
was chosen in his room, the Number was filled up,
therefore they are call'd <hi>the Twelve</hi> by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list,
but 'tis in a way of Synecdoche. <hi>He was seen
of the twelve,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 5. Yet there
were not above Eleven at that time. The true
Account of this is, that the Greatest Part hath the
Name of the Whole. And sometimes an Uneven
Number is put for an Even one, as in <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 14.
<hi>He appeared to the eleven,</hi> when there were but <hi>ten</hi>
present, for <hi>Thomas</hi> was not there, and <hi>Iudas</hi> had
hang'd himself. Thus the strict Number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and Things is not made use of sometimes in
Scripture. It was generally believed by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,

two,</hi> (six out of every Tribe) but are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
known by the Name of the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> This
is not unfrequent in Profane Authors, and in our
Common Discourse, as those that are call'd <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Stars</hi> are according to some Astronomers but
<hi>Six.</hi> Yea, this was taken notice of long ago by
<note n="*" place="bottom">In Fast.</note> 
                        <hi>Ovid:</hi>
                        <q>Quae septem dici, sex tamen esse solent.</q>
So we call them the <hi>Cinque Ports,</hi> which are
more in Number; for the Privileg'd Ports in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
were three at first; afterwards two were
added, and then they were call'd the <hi>Cinque Ports.</hi>
Yet after that, when two more were added, still
they retain'd the former Name: nay, another was
added, which made eight, and yet they are to this
Day call'd the <hi>Cinque Ports.</hi> And several other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
there are of this sort of <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> but my
Design is not to enumerate all of them, nor of any
Others that belong to the rest of the Figures, but
only to give you some few Examples of them, that
you may thence know how to discern the rest, and
by all together understand the Nature of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Stile.</p>
                     <p>But of all the <hi>Figurative</hi> ways of speaking in
Sripture, there is none so common as the <hi>Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical</hi>
one, which is when the Words are translated
from their proper and genuine Signification to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thus you read of <hi>trusting in the shadow (i. e.</hi>
the Protection) <hi>of</hi> Egypt. <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 3. Thus the
Psalmist complains that <hi>the Plowers plowed upon his
Back, and made long their Furrows,</hi> Psal. 129. 3. <hi>i. e.</hi>
they exceedingly troubled, vex'd and plagued
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46315:301"/>
him. So the Jews are call'd <hi>the threshing, and the
Corn of the Floor,</hi> Isa. 21. 10. <hi>i. e.</hi> a People that had
been extremely harassed and persecuted by their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.
And that is another Metaphorical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
of Affliction; <hi>Psal. 42. 7. All thy Waves
and thy Billows have gone over me.</hi> And a great
Multitude of such like Expressions there are every
where in the Old Testament. Sometimes there is
a double Metaphor, as in <hi>Psal. 97. 11. Light is
sown for the Righteous.</hi> The Joy, the Comfort
which is promised to Good Men, is here in a
borrowed Stile called <hi>Light;</hi> and not only so, but
<hi>Seed,</hi> precious Seed which is covered for a time,
(hid under Ground) but shall in due Season sprout
forth: and <hi>they that sow in Tears shall reap in Ioy;</hi>
which is still a farther Instance of this kind of
speaking. Sometimes there is a Continued Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor,
as in <hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 12, &amp;c. <hi>Sow to your selves in
Righteousness, reap in Mercy; break up your Fallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground:
for it is time to seek the Lord, till he come and
rain Righteousness upon you. Ye have plowed Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
ye have reaped Iniquity, ye have eaten the Fruit of
Lies.</hi> Here is a Heap of Metaphors taken from
the Field and Husbandry. Throughout the whole
<hi>23d</hi> Psalm, the Metaphor of a <hi>Shepherd</hi> is carried
on with relation to all the Particulars of his <hi>Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Charge,</hi> as I may have occasion to shew at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time.</p>
                     <p>But at present I will choose to insist upon that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Description of <hi>Old Age</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> gives
in the <hi>12th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> and which is
made up all along of an admirable <hi>Chain of Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors.</hi>
This is that Time of a Man's Life which is

are made part of their <hi>Character</hi> here) I mean
when a Divine Principle and a Lively Sense of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Holiness do not actuate them, when Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
hath not had its due Operation on their
Hearts, and their Lives are not reformed by the
Influence of the Holy Spirit. For otherwise it is
certain that Years administer to Vertue, and are
an excellent Help to Religion. The bravest and
noblest Actions that have been atchieved, have
been from the Counsels and Directions of Men of
Long Experience in the World; for now their
Minds and Judgments are arrived to the utmost
Maturity: like <hi>Old Wine,</hi> they are the more Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous

of Goodness and Piety, and the very Height and
Perfection of all Vertues, when it is season'd with
Divine Grace, and assisted by the supernatural Aids
of the Holy Ghost. But the Wise Man here speaks
of it under another Capacity, and as this part of
a Man's Life is generally and most commonly inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
both to natural and moral Defects of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

these are the unhappy <hi>Clouds</hi> that obscure its Light.
Yea, (as it follows) <hi>the Clouds return after the Rain;</hi>

to the <hi>Soul,</hi> which so frequently in the Close
of Mens Days is overwhelm'd with Ignorance, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
Forgetfulness, Conceitedness, Wilfulness,
Self-Love, and other Distempers which cast a
Scum over this Sun, and hinder it from shining
forth. And accordingly as the Unhealthful and
Sickly Years of their Lives come faster upon them,
these <hi>Clouds</hi> increase, and grow thicker and darker,
and so the Sun is overspread at last. One Mental
Evil succeeds another in this Concl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Mens Pilgrimage: There is a Circle of these Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies;
as Clouds produce Rain, and Rain falling
on the Earth begets new Vapours, and from these
proceed Clouds again: So it is here, there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Succession of Evils; thus <hi>the Clouds return
after the Rain.</hi> Hitherto you have the Character of
<hi>Old Age,</hi> as it hath respect to the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man, for
so I understand it, though Expositors are pleased
to go another way. But I would ask this, Is it not
most unlikely that <hi>Solomon</hi> undertaking here the
Description of <hi>Old Age,</hi> would give so lame and
imperfect an Account of it, as to relate some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
and Defects which have reference to
the Body, and wholly to pass by in silence those
that appertain to the Other and more Considerable
Part of Man? Again, I would ask whether there
could be any Words in the World that are fitter
and apter to express the Defects of the Mind, the
Nobler and Brighter Moiety of Man, than these
which the Wise Man here useth? Wherefore I
doubt not but this first Part of his Character is to
be understood as I have represented it to you. And
indeed since my finishing this Part of my Discourse,
I have found that some others, as<note n="*" place="bottom">Rhetor. 1. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>Glassius,</hi> and an

<hi>Solomon</hi>'s Words after this manner.</p>
                     <p>From the <hi>Soul</hi> he passes to the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Outward
Man:</hi> and that it may appear the better that this
is a distinct Partition from what went before, he
inserts these Words, [<hi>in the Day when</hi>] <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and
doth not repeat them any more afterwards; which
shews he begins a New Head, and that these Words
are only to mark out here to us this Division which
I am speaking of: which Commentators not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending

Verse, (which I have been explaining) and hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
applied it to the Evils of the Body: Whereas
Those are now in the next Place enter'd upon, and
I will endeavour to give you a particular Account
of them. First, he tells us, that <hi>the Keepers of the
House tremble,</hi> ver. 3. where the Body is compared
to a <hi>House;</hi> and what more fitly can be said to be
the <hi>Keepers</hi> of it than (as <hi>Castalio</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it) the active <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Arms,</hi> which were
made on purpose to guard and defend the Body,
and therefore on all Occasions officiously bestir
themselves, and are lifted up or stretch'd forth to
preserve it from harm, to keep and secure it from
Danger? But even these Nimble <hi>Guards,</hi> these
Stout and Brawny <hi>Keepers,</hi> shake at the Arrival of
<hi>Old Age,</hi> and with a Paralytick <hi>Trembling</hi> confess
their Inability to discharge their Office, to keep and
defend the <hi>House</hi> (the Tabernacle of the Body)
from Assaults and Injuries. Yea, these once-Trusty
Guardians, who were wont to make use of Staves
and other Weapons for their Defence, now use
the former only for a Support. With this they
knock at the Earth at every Step, as if they call'd
on their Graves: Or, as the Spanish Proverb hath
it, The Old Man's Staff is the Rapper at Death's
Door. And <hi>the strong Man, i. e.</hi> according to <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablus</hi>
and <hi>Grotius,</hi> the <hi>Legs</hi> and <hi>Thighs,</hi> which are
placed in another Extremity of the House, to be
its Security, and which are particularly taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of for their <hi>Strength,</hi> Psal. 147. 10. and which
<hi>Strong Men</hi> so much glory in, these <hi>bow themselves,
i. e.</hi> become weak and feeble with Age; yea, they
really <hi>bend</hi> and give way, they are so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to support the Body they belong to, that
they can hardly sustain themselves. These <hi>bow,</hi>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:46315:304"/>
these <hi>stoop</hi> towards the Place where they are shortly
to take their R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>st. Next, it is said, that <hi>the Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

cease, because they are few; i. e.</hi> the Teeth with
which we grind and chew our Meat fail us at last,
and are not able to do their Office, because not
only the Strength but the Number of them is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd:
yea, sometimes the Toothless Jaws (as
well as other Defects) shew that Aged Persons are
a second time <hi>Children.</hi> It follows, <hi>those that look
out of the Windows are darkned:</hi> for he had compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Body to a <hi>House,</hi> and so here he continues
that Metaphor, as well as goes on with several
others. The <hi>Windows</hi> of this House are the Holes
or Sockets wherein the <hi>Eyes</hi> are placed, (the two
Bonny Cavities where these precious <hi>Lights</hi> are
safely enclosed, to defend them from Hurt) which
are said to <hi>look out of</hi> these Casements, <hi>i. e.</hi> there
(as <hi>Drusius</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> well interpret it) they were
appointed by Heaven to exert their <hi>Visive</hi> Faculty
for the use of Mankind. But Length of Years im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs
or hinders their <hi>looking out:</hi> the <hi>Visual Nerves</hi>
and the <hi>Spirits</hi> which are derived to them decay;
the <hi>Humours</hi> dry up, the <hi>Coats</hi> wear out, the <hi>Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
flag, and so 'tis no wonder that the Sight is
dim and imperfect, and that there is a necessity of
using some Artificial Helps to amend it. Whence
<hi>Gejerus</hi> and some others have fancied, that <hi>those that
look out of the Windows</hi> are such as are forced to use
<hi>Spectacles:</hi> but this Gloss, I think, will hardly be
admitted till it be proved that there was such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Days.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>House</hi> of our Body hath a <hi>Door,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis said in the next Place, <hi>the Doors are shut in
the Streets,</hi> ver. 4. And what can more properly be
called the <hi>Door</hi> of this House than the Mouth, the
Throat, the Wind-pipe, the Lungs, the Stomach,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46315:305"/>
all those Vessels that are to let in Air or
Food? These Doors are <hi>in the Street,</hi> that Great
Passage and Hollowness in the Body which is
like a Street or High-way, and by which there
are other Passages into several Parts of the Body.
These <hi>Doors are shut,</hi> when by reason of Age they
are obstructed, when they are clogg'd with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Colds and Catarrhs, when the Jaws and
Throat are inflamed, when the Muscles of them
are swell'd, whereby the Ways of Breathing and
Swallowing are stopp'd; when the Lungs are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded
by Asthma's, and fail in their reciprocal
Motion of Inspiration and Respiration; when the
Chyle is not duly separated, and the Ferment of
the Stomach is vitiated; and other the like Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers,
which the Aged are subject to, invade
those Parts. But more especially and signally the
<hi>Mouth</hi> is the <hi>Door</hi> of this House, which I confirm
from what follows, <hi>when the Sound of the Grinding is
low;</hi> that is, this Door is shut, or but seldom open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when their great Weakness and Indisposition
will not suffer them to take any Food, or but an
inconsiderable Portion of it, then <hi>the Sound of the
Grinding is low.</hi> And it is <hi>low,</hi> not only because of
this Weakness of the Body, but because (as was
said before) <hi>the Grinders are few,</hi> they have not a
sufficient Number of Teeth for Mastication. Hence
'tis that there is none or little <hi>Grist</hi> brought to the
Mill. I know some have thought, that <hi>the Doors
being shut in the Street,</hi> signifies here, that those
Persons who are of Great Age desire to keep up,
and come not into Company, as before. The
thing it self, I grant, is true; the Indispositions
which some Aged Persons labour under, cause
them to shut up their Doors, especially when the
Winter approacheth, and they appear not till a
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46315:305"/>
very Warm Sun invites them to shew themselves.
Then they get to the next Sunny Bank, and there
lie basking in the comfortable Rays which they
feel. But if we consider that the Royal Preacher
had been comparing the Body of Man to a <hi>House,</hi>
assigning its <hi>Keepers,</hi> yea its <hi>Grinders,</hi> (the most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Office of old in a Family) its <hi>Windows,</hi> its
<hi>Doors,</hi> we must needs look upon this Interpretation
as foreign and impertinent, and especially when
we take notice of the Design of this Inspired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
in this Chapter, which is to insist upon those
Evils and Maladies which belong to such and such
particular Parts of the Body, as will appear in the
Sequel. Yea, by looking into the very next Words
we shall find that this Clause, which I have been
now speaking of, is to be understood in this Sense,
and no other; for it is to be joined with those
Words, (because of its Affinity with them) <hi>he
shall rise up at the Voice of the Bird:</hi> which I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret

<hi>small delicate Bird,</hi> he rises up very chearfully to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46315:306"/>
eat it, or some part of it at least. The Hebrew
Verb <hi>Kum,</hi> which is used here, most frequently
signifies <hi>to stand up,</hi> or <hi>lift up one's self.</hi> This the
sickly Old Man is observed to do when some Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Fare is set before him, when some choice
Dish, some delightful and savory Morsel is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to him. This is part of the genuine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
which may be given of the Aged Persons
Condition, and therefore 'tis no wonder that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
brings it in here. A little Food serves him,
but he longs for that which is Uncommon, and
may please his Taste, and provoke his Appetite at
the same time: He rises up with Complacency at
the very mentioning of some dainty Bird, some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Bit. This is my Conjecture on the Place,
and I do not (I must needs say) see any Ground
why it should be rejected for I have shewed you
that it is to the purpose which <hi>Solomon</hi> is speaking
of; it exactly agrees with the preceding Words,
but the Vulgar Exposition doth not so.</p>
                     <p>To proceed, our Royal Author having repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the Defects of Old Age, as to the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

of <hi>Teeth,</hi> Dimness of <hi>Eyes,</hi> and the Evils inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to those Parts which are call'd the <hi>Doors,</hi> he
lets us know next, that this Portion of a Man's
Life is as defective, in respect of Other Useful Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
of the Body, and particularly that of the
<hi>Ear: all the Daughters of Musick are brought low:</hi>
that is, the <hi>Ears,</hi> which were made for Hearing,
and particularly delighting themselves in excellent
Notes of Musick, whether Vocal or Instrumental,
are now indisposed, and rendred uncapable of
that Pleasure which before they were so charm'd
with: Now these <hi>Daughters of a Song are grown
deaf,</hi> as the Vulgar Latin renders it. As Old <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zillai</hi>'s

I eat or drink?</hi> (which refers to the former Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
we just now spoke of) but likewise, <hi>Can I
hear any more the Voice of singing Men and singing
Women?</hi> Even <hi>these Daughters of Musick</hi> are brought
low, their most exquisite and ravishing Harmony

for the Youthful and Mercurial Spirit is
exhausted: in this Foggy Cloudy Weather of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
Age the Quicksilver subsides in these Old
Weather-Glasses, and will never ascend again. I
might add also, that the <hi>Vessels</hi> and <hi>Organs</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong to the forming of the <hi>Voice, those
Daughters of Singing,</hi> are by Age disabled and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Next, it is said, <hi>ver. 5. They are afraid of
that which is high:</hi> The plain meaning whereof is
this, that Aged Persons dare not ascend any high
or steep Place; their Breath is short, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they avoid climbing. And when they tread
on low Ground, and walk in a smooth Path, yet
even then <hi>Fears are in the way,</hi> i. e. they are afraid
of stumbling and falling, because their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

better to walk than those of the Old, though they

<hi>the Grashopper is a Burden,</hi> i. e. the least, the lightest
thing (say Expositors generally) seems to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and burdensom to the Aged, because of their
Faintness and Weakness: Or rather, I should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
it thus, (with reference to what was said
before, and is so noted and common an Indication
of Declining Years) the <hi>Grashopper,</hi> as little as it
is, lies heavy on their Stomachs; for you will find
in <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. 22. that the <hi>Grashopper</hi> is reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Clean Meats,</hi> and was commonly eaten
in those Days. And this here mentioned is of that
very Species, as the using of the same Hebrew
Word both here and there lets us know. Even
this light kind of Food was a Burden to their weak
Stomachs. What can be more obvious and plain
than this Exposition of the Words? especially
when it follows, <hi>Desire fails;</hi> as all other Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that were vigorous in them in their juvenile
Years do now flag, so <hi>this towards Food</hi> more sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

from the<note n="*" place="bottom">

So that this way of speaking is metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically
used to denote the Defect of Appetite in
Aged Men, whose Stomachs are depraved. And
this is no wonder, because <hi>they go to their long Home,

                        <pb n="151" facs="tcp:46315:307"/>But yet before this Day arrives, they have far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Evils to undergo; For, saith the Wise Man,
when this great Number of Years is gone over
their Heads, they will find that <hi>the silver Cord is
not lengthned,</hi> for so the Hebrew hath it; the word

this Passage to some particular Part of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
(as the other Members of this Verse seem also
to be restrained) and so <hi>the silver Cord is loosed,</hi> (as
we translate it) <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Spinal Marrow,</hi> which is
white like <hi>Silver,</hi> and lengthned out like a <hi>Cord</hi> or
Rope, decays and grows loose: and then the
<hi>Nerves,</hi> which are derived from it, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the whole Body, feel the ill Effect of it in
Palsies and Convulsions, and an universal Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Thus it is when the Body is worn out with
Age; when these <hi>evil Days</hi> come, all things portend
Ruine and a final Period. The <hi>House,</hi> as the Body
is said to be, is falling; and all things belonging to
it are hastning to their Destruction. Not only the
<hi>silver Cord is loosed,</hi> but <hi>the golden Bowl is broken;</hi> by
which some think is here meant the <hi>Cranium,</hi> or
Pan, in which that choice <hi>Vis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

contained and secured; or perhaps the Semicircu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Membrane which is next to this Bowl, and is
it self lined with a thinner Membranous Substance,
is here designed. <hi>Vatablus</hi> and <hi>Drusius,</hi> and others,
interpret the Words thus, and tell us, that these
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:46315:308"/>
                        <hi>Meninges</hi> are said to be <hi>of Gold,</hi> not only by reason
of their Colour, but because of their great Worth
and Value, in that they are a Guard and Covering
to the noblest Part of Man's Body: Or the Brain
it self may be here meant, the Seat and Throne of
the Rational Soul, and the Origine of all the
Nerves. And then observe here, that the <hi>Golden
Bowl</hi> and the <hi>Silver Cord</hi> are fitly joined together by
this Divine Writer, for the latter is but an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix
of the former; the <hi>Marrow</hi> of the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Bone
is but the <hi>Cerebrum</hi> extended, the Brain
lengthned out; or it is according to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Stile
here <hi>a Rope,</hi> a <hi>Cord</hi> of Brains. But the Head and
Beginning of that <hi>Medulla</hi> is that which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called the <hi>Brain,</hi> the Great and Only Laborato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Animal Spirits, from whence they are
diffused by the Nerves into the several Members of
the Body, in order to all the Functions and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Life. This <hi>gullath hazahab,</hi> this <hi>Golden
Bowl,</hi> this <hi>Lordly Dish,</hi> this roundish Mass of choice
Matter is at last <hi>broken:</hi> which is as much as to say,
this upper and nobler Part of the Body shares in
the Ruines which Old Age makes: whence it is
that the Clogging of the Passages of the animal
Spirits with indigested Humours, the Obstructions
or Relaxations of the Nerves, Pains in the Head,
Melancholy, Giddiness, Drowsiness, yea Lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
and Apoplexies (which impair or wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
both Sense and Motion) are the dangerous
Maladies of this Part of the Body, and are more
especially the mischievous Companions of the
Aged.</p>
                     <p>And as the Animal, so the Vital Parts feel the
Decays which a Long and Sickly Life brings with
it, which the Wise Man means when he adjoins,
<hi>the Pitcher is broken at the Fountain.</hi> The <hi>Pitchers</hi>
                        <pb n="153" facs="tcp:46315:308"/>
(for the Plural is intended when the Singular is
mentioned, as I have shewed to be frequent in
Scripture-Stile) are the <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries,</hi> whose
Office it is to carry and recarry Blood to and from
the Heart, (that is the <hi>Fountain</hi>) as <hi>Pitchers</hi> or
Buckets are first let down into the Well, and then
convey Water thence. Through these Vessels the
Blood continually passes, and that swiftly, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
its Course from the right Cavity of the Heart,
through the <hi>Arterious Vein,</hi> the Branches of which
are dispersed through the whole Lungs, and joined
to the Branches of the <hi>Veiny Artery,</hi> by which it
passes from the Lungs into the left side of the Heart,
and thence it flows into the <hi>Great Artery;</hi> the
Branches of which being spread through all the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
are united to those of the <hi>Hollow Vein,</hi> which
carry the same Blood again into the right Ventricle
of the Heart. But these Vessels by length of time
become disordered and shattered, these <hi>Pitchers are
broken at the Fountain;</hi> the Heart it self, as well as
they, decaying and declining in its Office; whence
proceed Faintings, Swoonings, Tremblings, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitations,
and other Distempers, which are the
Product of an undue Sanguification.</p>
                     <p>Lastly; 'tis said, <hi>the Wheel is broken at the Cistern,</hi>
which an<note n="*" place="bottom">J. Smith, M. D.</note> Ingenious Person understands of the
<hi>Circulation of the Blood,</hi> (for that he thinks is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by the <hi>Wheel</hi>) and its being obstructed by
the Indispositions of Old Age. But it is much to
be questioned, whether <hi>Solomon,</hi> as <hi>Wise</hi> a Man as
he was, <hi>knew</hi> any thing of the Circular Motion of
the Blood throughout the whole Body. I have no
stronger a Belief of his Knowledg in this kind,
than that his Ships went to the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West-Indies,</hi>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:46315:309"/>
though I find both of these asserted by different
Writers. However, I conceive this Circulation is
not meant in this place; for the word <hi>Bor, Puteus,</hi>
or <hi>Cisterna,</hi> baffles this Notion, for this Author
makes the <hi>Cistern</hi> here to be the Left Ventricle of
the Heart; whereas the Heart, with both its Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles,
is rather a <hi>Fountain</hi> than a <hi>Cistern:</hi> yea, he
had himself applied this Word to the <hi>Heart,</hi> in his
Exposition of the former Clause of the Verse;
and there was Reason for it, because the Waters do
spring and flow in a <hi>Fountain,</hi> but they lie dead and
moveless in a <hi>Cistern</hi> or Pit under Ground, which
is the same thing. Wherefore I conclude that this
<hi>Cistern</hi> must be something of another Nature; and
what is that but the <hi>Vrinary Vessels,</hi> especially the
<hi>Bladder?</hi> This, without any fanciful straining,
must be acknowledged to be the <hi>Cistern</hi> of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
it being a Vessel situated beneath, on purpose
to receive and keep the Water that comes from
the Ureters. And here, as in those Receptacles
in the Ground, the Water gathers a Sediment, and
grows muddy; the evil Effects of which are too
well known to Mankind. This <hi>Vesica</hi> then, which
is made to gather and hold the Urine, is properly
<hi>Bor</hi> (the word in this Place) <hi>Puteus, Cisterna.</hi> And
<hi>the Wheel</hi> is said to be <hi>broken</hi> at this Cistern, when
those Vessels and Organs which were appointed for
the Percolation of the Blood, that is, the sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
the serous Humour from it, and for the
transmitting it through the Emulgent Arteries into
the Ureters, and thence carrying it to the proper
Vessel (the <hi>Cistern</hi>) which is made to receive it;
when (I say) these are put out of order, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd,
then they cease to perform their proper
Administrations in the Body; whereupon imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
are produced, in these dark and narrow
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46315:309"/>
Passages the Painful Stone and Gravel in the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

Ulcers, Inflammations, the Strangury, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a total Suppression of the Urine, together
with the undue Evacuations of it. Thus <hi>the Wheel
is broken;</hi> thus the whole Periodical Series of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in those Parts is spoiled and destroyed. And
perhaps this particular Phrase is here used by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
because the great Work at Wells and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterns
(or Pits for retaining of Water for a time)
was performed by <hi>Wheels.</hi> So much for this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Delineation of <hi>Old Age,</hi> which is it self a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
a constant and inseparable Malady, and is
attended with many more. And as the Bodies of
the Aged are the Scene of Weakness and Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
of Pains and Languishments; so their Souls
are usually decayed and distemper'd. Of both
these <hi>Solomon</hi> gives us a particular Account, (and
perhaps too much from his own Experience, for
'tis probable that the Miscarriages of his Youth had
enfeebled Nature; and we read, that towards the
Close of his Days, he degenerated from his former
Piety;) and so we have here a Full and Compleat
Description of the <hi>Defects,</hi> which too often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company

                        <p>The Writers of the New Testament are delighted with

of them. Ephes. 6. 13. &amp;c. Take unto

the Rewards, and all other things appertaining to these
Athletick Enterprizes, distinctly consider'd; 'tis
shew'd how they are all applied to Christianity in the
Apostolick Writings. Hence is inferr'd the Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of the Sacred Stile: Notwithstanding which
some have vilified it, whose Character is represented.

                     <p>IF we pass to the New Testament, we shall there
find that those Inspired Penmen are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with the use of <hi>Metaphors.</hi> We have

Eph. 6. 13, to <hi>ver. 18. Take unto you the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of God,</hi> &amp;c. which under that one Great and
General <hi>Metaphor</hi> of <hi>Armour</hi> comprehends several
other particular ones. Christians are represented
as <hi>Souldiers</hi> in other Places by this Apostle, and
here he lets us know what is their <hi>Armour,</hi> what
<hi>Weapons</hi> they must fight with: which are thus <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically</hi> expressed.</p>
                     <p>1. They must be careful to put on <hi>the Girdle of
Truth,</hi> which some Expositors have thought is
meant in opposition to <hi>Error</hi> and Heretical Perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
<hi>To be girt about with Truth,</hi> is the same, they
think, with <hi>holding fast the Form of sound Words,</hi>
or the embracing of the pure Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
But this Exposition is not to be admitted,
because it confounds this piece of Armour with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
that is afterwards mentioned; it makes the
<hi>Girdle</hi> and the <hi>Sword</hi> (which is <hi>the Word</hi> or Doctrine
<hi>of God</hi>) the same. Therefore it is more reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to assert, that <hi>Truth</hi> here is synonymous with
Faithfulness or Sincerity, and that it stands in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to Hypocrisy. Thus <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi>
are equivalent Terms, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 8. and in several
other Places. Wherefore when the <hi>Christian Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi>
is commanded to have <hi>his Loins girt about with
Truth;</hi> the plain Import of it is, that he ought to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46315:311"/>
be established with Sincerity and Integrity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ience.
Hypocrisy enervates and dissolves the
Mind, renders it loose and unsettled; but Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness
and Faithfulness keep it close and entire,
make it firm and steady; yea, strengthen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
all the other Graces, as the <hi>Girdle of War</hi> was
used to fasten their Clothes together, and to keep
their Loins firm. It is not unlikely that this Place
refers particularly to <hi>Isa. 11. 5. Faithfulness shall be
the Girdle of his Reins.</hi> This <hi>Truth</hi> also implies For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
Resolution and Constancy, that they will
never revolt from the Captain of their Salvation,
but fight under his Banner even unto Death; for
he that is Sincere and Faithful will do so. This is
the first Martial Accoutrement of the Christian
Souldier, and 'tis of indispensable Use and Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Holy Warfare: as among the antient
Warriors there was no fighting without the <hi>Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Girdle</hi> or Belt. Whence <hi>Cinctus,</hi> simply, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Addition, is as much as<note n="*" place="bottom">Marcell. de Test.</note>

for War. It is often mentioned by <hi>Homer</hi> Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochichally
for the Whole Military Armour; and

                        </gap> is as much as to be compleatly Armed.
<hi>The Girdle of Truth,</hi> which this Great Commander
here enjoins us, is as requisite in the Christian War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare:
there is no Fighting without it, because this
fastens all the other Parts of our Spiritual Armour:
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46315:311"/>
a Sincere and Upright Heart is of universal Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in the Life of a Christian.</p>
                     <p>2. The next Accoutrement is <hi>the Breast-plate of
Righteousness, i. e.</hi> a Holy and Pious Conversation,
Impartial and Universal Obedience to the Will of
God. This guards the Breast against all Assaults,
as we see in the Example of our Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.
12. for he had this as well as the foregoing piece of
Armour on when he said, <hi>Our rejoicing is this, the
Testimony of our Coscience, that in Simplicity and
godly Sincerity, not with fleshly Wisdom, but by the
Grace of God, we have had our Conversation in the
World.</hi> And again, <hi>I have fought a good Fight, I
have finished my Course, I have kept the Faith,</hi> 2 Tim.
4. 7. And in other Places he defends himself against
the malicious Cavils of others, by appealing to his
own Innocency, his Sanctity and Exemplary Life.
This perhaps may have particular reference to
Isa. 59. 17. <hi>He put on Righteousness as a Breast-plate.</hi>
But this <hi>Breast-plate of Righteousness</hi> must be covered
with another, <hi>viz.</hi> that of our Blessed Redeemer,
which is Compleat and Perfect, and will amply
protect and secure us from all Dangers. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
Righteousness of the best of Men is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
defective, and cannot shelter them from the
Divine Wrath; this Breast-plate is too narrow,
too thin, too little, too mean to cover us; but that
of the Meritorious Righteousness of Christ Jesus is
great and large enough, and is able to hide all our
Defects, and perfectly to defend us from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of our offended God. This Evangelical Breast-plate
must be <hi>put on</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> of which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>The Shoe of the Preparation of the Gospel of Peace</hi>
is an Allusion to that Military Provision which the
Infantry, among the antient Warriors, made for
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46315:312"/>
their <hi>Feet,</hi> to defend them from what was offensive
in their way. For the Armies heretofore (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
both from Greek and Roman Authors) were
wont to fix short Stakes, or cast Gall-traps in the
way before their Enemies, to wound their Feet,
and to cause them to fall. Wherefore it was usual
to have Harness for their Legs and Feet: they wore
a particular sort of <hi>Shoe</hi> or <hi>Boot</hi> to secure them from
being hurt and gall'd. So the Christian Souldier
ought <hi>to have his Feet shod,</hi> and that <hi>with the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Goslpel, i. e.</hi> he must be sitted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
by the preaching of the Gospel for all Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
and Distresses. I do not much like St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>'s
way of proving this Interpretation, <hi>viz.</hi>
by telling us, that by the <hi>Shoe</hi> the Preaching of the
Gospel was meant when the Psalmist said, <hi>Over</hi>
Edom <hi>will I cast out my</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Cujus rei calceamentum nisi Evangelii? De Cons. Evang. l. 2. c. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>Shoe,</hi> Psal. 60. 8. which he
labours to confirm from <hi>Isa. 52. 7. How beautiful are
the Feet of him that bringeth good Tidings?</hi> And this
Pious Writer is so fanciful as to say, that when
our Saviour bid the Disciples be <hi>shod with Sandals,
Mark</hi> 6. 9. he meant the open and free Preaching
of the Gospel. But waving this weak sort of
Proof, yet I am satisfied, that in this place, the
Christians <hi>Military Shoe</hi> is the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and the
Preaching of it: he is then <hi>shod with the Preparation
of it,</hi> when he is enabled to make his way through
all Hindrances and Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of those Excellent Principles which the Gospel

Helps which this affords him. And 'tis

                        </gap>itly added, <hi>the Gospel of Peace,</hi> because the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of that Peace and Reconciliation which
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46315:312"/>
the Gospel tenders through the Blood of Christ,
mightily influences upon his Spirit, and gives Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Valour amidst all the Hardships he meets
with in his Christian Warfare.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>The Shield of Faith</hi> is another necessary part of
<hi>Spiritual Armour.</hi> And it is signally added, that
we must take this <hi>above all,</hi> which it is probable
is said with allusion to what was the sense of the
Old Warriors, <hi>viz.</hi> That their <hi>Shield</hi> was their
<hi>Principal Armour.</hi> This they prized above all the
rest, and were most careful in keeping it: of which
we have several Instances in Antient History: and
there was a Remarkable Punishment inflicted on
those (saith<note n="*" place="bottom">In Pelopid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi>) who lost their <hi>Shields</hi> in
Battel. Much more Valuable is this Evangelick
Armour, our <hi>Faith,</hi> a Firm Assent to all Revealed
Truths, a Steady Belief of the Promises of Eternal
Life, through the blessed Undertakings of our Lord,
a Hearty Compliance with the Gracious Terms of
the Gospel, which enjoins Universal Obedience to
the Laws of Christ, a Well-grounded Trust and
A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>iance in the Mercy and Goodness of God, a firm
and unshaken Dependance on the Merits of our
Redeemer and Saviour. This is that Hardned
Shield wherewith we keep off and beat back all the
furious Insults of the Evil Spirit, that Implacable
Enemy whom we are to encounter with in our
Spiritual Warfare. His Temptations are here

—<hi>Instant ardentes Tyrii.</hi>—And besides, these
Darts, these Suggestions, when they are very fierce
and raging, do as 'twere <hi>inflame</hi> the Heart and
Conscience, they set the distracted Soul on fire.
But by <hi>Faith</hi> the Christian Soldier is able to <hi>quench</hi>
them, as the Apostle excellently phraseth it; by
a vigorous exerting of this Grace he defeats the
malicious Attempts of Satan, he stifles all his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Darts; alluding to the known use of the
<hi>Shield,</hi> which was to repel the <hi>Arrows</hi> shot by the
Enemy. And these were sometimes <hi>Poisoned,</hi> and
thereby became <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>inflaming,</hi> to which some
have thought the Apostle here might have glanced
when he speaks of <hi>fiery Darts.</hi> This is certain
that a <hi>Shield</hi> is for Defence, and such is our <hi>Faith,</hi>
whereby we defend our selves from the inslamed
Darts of the Wicked, which he flings at us with
the utmost Indignation and Fury. We <hi>quench,</hi> we
extinguish, we utterly frustrate all his Assaults by
a firm Trust and Reliance on our Blessed Jesus,
who baffled him himself, and will effectually teach
us by the guidance of his Spirit to do the like.

on his Head.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>6. <hi>The Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God,</hi>
is another part of the Christian <hi>Panoply,</hi> which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Spiritual Souldier ought to be appointed with.
This is the <hi>two-edged Sword</hi> spoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12.
and <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 16. This our great Captain dexterously
made use of when the Infernal Spirit assaulted him,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 4, 7, 10. And the same Weapon was bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish'd
and managed by the whole Army of Martyrs
and Confessors, by all the Servants of Christ in the
several Ages of the Church. By this they have done
great Execution, and put their Spiritual Enemies
to flight. They have in their most pressing Straits
repair'd to the Holy Scriptures, and thence fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
themselves with those Divine Consolations,
and applied those Sacred Promises, whereby they
soon vanquish'd their Ghostly Assailants. And this
is that Weapon which we must all of us in our

both for <hi>Defence</hi> and <hi>Offence,</hi> not only to guard our
selves, but to oppose our Enemies. This is the
<hi>Panoply</hi> of the Gospel, <hi>the whole Armour of God</hi> which
the Apostle here commends, and which I have
briefly descanted upon in prosecution of what I
propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> to give you some account of the
<hi>Metaphorical</hi> Terms in Scripture.</p>

<hi>Metaphors:</hi> those <hi>Grecian Combates</hi> being made use

of this part of my Discourse concerning the <hi>Stile</hi>
of Scripture, let you see what Excellent and Divine
things are comprized under those <hi>Agonistick</hi> Phrases.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46315:314"/>
We must know then, that the <hi>Olympick Games</hi> were
of very great Antiquity, being instituted (as it is
said) by <hi>Hercules,</hi> and restored by <hi>Iphitus,</hi> who at
the same time began the Accompt of the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piads,
that famous Epoche of the Greeks which
commenced <hi>A. M.</hi> 3173. in the time of <hi>Vzziah</hi>
King of <hi>Iudah.</hi> They had their Name from <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi>
a City of <hi>Achaia,</hi> near to <hi>Elis,</hi> on the Plains
whereof these Exercises were celebrated, and they
were in honour of <hi>Iupiter Olympius.</hi> And there
were Sports of the like Nature in other parts of

they were begun in the <hi>Corinthian Isthmus:
and as the Olympick</hi> Plays were dedicated to <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
so these were in honour of <hi>Melicerta;</hi> others say, of
<hi>Palaemon.</hi> The like Exercises in other adjacent
Towns of <hi>Greece</hi> were call'd <hi>Pythian,</hi> in memory of
<hi>Apollo Pythius;</hi> and others <hi>Nemaean,</hi> (call'd so from

these were in honour of <hi>Archemorus,</hi> the Son of
<hi>Lycurgus.</hi> But all these were in imitation of the
<hi>Olympick</hi> (as being the Antientest) Combates; and
because they were so like them, they sometimes
go by that Name. Great Numbers of People
flock'd from all parts in <hi>Greece</hi> to these Solemn Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,
either to try their Skill, or to be Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.
And I question not but St. <hi>Paul,</hi> before his
Conversion, had been present at these Exercises,
and observ'd their Customs and Practices: whence
it is that he so often in his Writings makes use of
them. And these Games were very well known
to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> particularly, as being celebrated
in their <hi>Isthmus,</hi> not far from <hi>Corinth;</hi> whence it
is that the Apostle speaking to these People, saith

in another Sense, as when 'twas given to <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi>
because he was the Master of five noble Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments).
Of these several Olympick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts,
the chiefest and most renowned was their
<hi>Running</hi> or <hi>Racing,</hi> for which the Grecians were
so famous and eminent above all others; and
therefore St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had been a Spectator of
their <hi>Races,</hi> principally borrows his <hi>Metaphors</hi> from
this Manly as well as Applauded kind of Sport, as
you may see in his <hi>Epistles,</hi> which abound with
Expressions taken from this Athletick Exercise.
But he sometimes alludes to <hi>Wrestling,</hi> and the
other Agonistick Enterprizes which the Grecians
in those days were celebrated for. He frequently
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46315:315"/>
uses the Terms which are proper to these Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings,
as when he saith,<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 24. 16.</note>

<hi>Bodily Exercise profiteth a little,</hi>
(for so I would translate it) <hi>i. e.</hi> as I apprehend
the words, that Athletick Exercise of their Bodies

this <hi>Abstinence</hi> of the Athleticks. And

<note n="†" place="bottom">Athletae segregantur ad strictiorem disciplinam ut robori aedificando vacent: continentur à luxuriâ, cibis lautioribus, à potu jucundiore. Exhort. ad Martyr.</note> 
                        <q>They are set apart, saith he, to a
strict Discipline, that they may be at leisure
to mind the building up of their Bodies (as
'twere) and to make them strong according to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46315:317"/>
Art. To which purpose they are kept from
all Luxury, they are forbid all delicate Meats,
and all sweet Drinks.</q> But the Apostle hath
contracted this into fewer words, yet as full and
significant, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 25. Every Man that striveth for
the Mastery is temperate in all things;</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

he observes all the Laws of Abstinence
and Continence which are prescrib'd him. And
there was an Overseer for this purpose, one that
took care of dieting them, and saw that they duly
kept their other Rules. A Christian must herein
imitate the Grecian Combatants and Racers, he
must manage himself with great Caution and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection,
he must suffer himself to be order'd
and disciplined, he must strictly observe the Laws
of Sobriety and Temperance, and abstain from
fleshly Lusts which war against both Soul and Body.
Thus the Apostle pursues the Metaphor in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words, <hi>v. 27. I keep under my Body, and
bring it into subjection:</hi> i. e. I am careful to get a
good Temper of Body as well as of Mind: as the
<hi>Cuffers</hi> and <hi>Wres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

under their Antagonists Bodies, so I do with my
own: for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (which is the word here used)
is a known Metaphor taken from the practice of
the Grecian Combatants, who beat their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
down with their Fists, and sometimes with
Clubs, and will not suffer them to rise. In the
same manner, saith he, I beat down and keep under
my Body, I severely chastise it by Temperance
and Sobriety. I am as exact as those Combatants
were, who before the Contest dieted themselves
for certain days, that they might attain to a good
habit of Body. Again, they took care to rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of all Incumbrances whatsoever: they stript
themselves of their Clothes, and generally came
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:46315:317"/>
naked to the Conflict, (whence they were call'd
<hi>Gymnastae</hi>) that they might be the more nimble
and agile. To which the Apostle plainly refers,
and applies it, <hi>Heb. 12. 1. Let us lay aside every
weight, and the Sin which doth so easily beset us, and
let us run with Patience the Race that is set before us.</hi>
In this our Christian Race, we must throw off what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we know will be an Impediment to us in our
course, especially we must discard those Vices
which we have been most accustomed to, and
which have had the greatest Ascendant over us.
And it is to be observed, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
(which the Apostle here useth) is applied by <hi>Galen</hi>
and other Greek Authors to the Corpulency, the
<hi>weight</hi> of Flesh which the <hi>Olympick</hi> Strivers were to
bring down and macerate.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, we are to order and manage
our selves aright <hi>in the time</hi> of the Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate:
And here likewise the Apostle leads us by
the same Metaphor. For,</p>
                     <p>1. The Combatants were careful to act, to strive,
to labour to the utmost.<note n="*" place="bottom">Coguntur, cruciantur, fatigantur: quanto plùs in exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus laboraverint, tanto plus de victoriâ sperant. Tertull. Exhort. ad Martyr.</note> 
                        <q>There is a Force and
Violence put upon them by themselves, they are
cruciated and tormented, they are tired and
worn out: and (as the same Author adds) the
more they labour in their Combats, the greater
is their hope of Victory.</q> This Excessive Pains
and Labour are express'd in the Writings of the
Apostle by several terms, as <hi>following on</hi> (for so

and <hi>pressing on</hi> (or following on) for the Apostle

are in a Religious manner thus applied by
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that Eminent Christian Racer,<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. 3. 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

one thing I do, for getting those things which are behind,</hi>
(not looking back in the Race to see how much

meaning of which is, that he was extremely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
and Laborious in his Christian course, he
not only <hi>ran with Patience</hi> (Patience of Body and

after St. <hi>Paul</hi> had with rejoicing professed that he

he adds, <hi>There is laid up for me a Crown of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>

And from what hath been said, we may gather
that these Divine Writings come not short of the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46315:323"/>
most Applauded Pieces of the Greek or Latin Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors;
for here are those very Schemes and Modes
of Speech which imbellish those Authors Works;
here are all the Graces and Elegancies which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
and adorn them. Therefore in that place
beforementioned, where <hi>Origen</hi> saith, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not written <hi>Politely;</hi> his meaning is, that
that is not the Scope and Design of those Writings,
and that it is not the thing that is pursued gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
there being a Greater and Higher Design;
yet in many places there are very Excellent Strains
of Oratory, there are very Artificial Periods and
Sentences, there are Words, Phrases and Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in a very Rhetorical Dress. But where you
find others that are, as you think, Inartificial, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth,
and no ways Graceful, you must remember
this (to take off your prejudice against the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the <hi>Eastern</hi> Eloquence is vastly
different from ours in the <hi>West.</hi> The Mode and
Guise of their Oratory were unlike that of the
Greeks and Romans, and of Ours at this Day,
and therefore we are not to expect that they
should be fitted to it. It is certain (though we
perceive it not) that their <hi>Stile</hi> was Graceful and
Fashionable: which is clear from the considering
the Persons that were the Penmen of some parts
of Scripture; namely, <hi>Moses, David, Solomon,
Isaiah, Daniel,</hi> Men of great Improvements and
Accomplishments, and Masters of the Language
they spoke. Neither are the Scriptures in some
parts of them Defective in the <hi>Western</hi> Oratory:
they abound with the Choicest Schemes of Speech,
with the Greatest Ornaments of Language, with
the Chiefest Elegancies which <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> were
famous for.</p>

                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:46315:323"/>Yet, notwithstanding this, there are those who
have vilified the <hi>Stile</hi> of Scripture. Some Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to Criticism, but of debauched Minds, and
loose Lives, have endeavour'd to render it very
Mean and Despicable. You have heard of the

deny, as <hi>Caspar Peucer</hi> tells us, that there were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Sentences, Histories, Examples, and Figures
of Speech in this Divine Poem. Yet such was the
Sottishness of <hi>Politian</hi> (for that was his Name)
that he profess'd he never spent his time worse than
in reading this and other parts of the Bible:
and at last he desisted from reading any further,
because of the Barbarity of the <hi>Stile.</hi> But observe
what Character<note n="*" place="bottom">De verit. fid. l. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi> (a Man of his
own Religion) gives him: he represents him as
a Person, who, though he had more Polite Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
than was frequent in those Days, made but ill
use of it, and employ'd it wholly in the worst sort
of Criticism and Playing with words. It was this
Busy but Idle Critick that spoke so contemptibly
of the Bible; where, because he met with some
things unsutable to his Grammatical and Critical
Genius, he censured and condemned all. Of the
same Profane Disposition was <hi>Domitius Calderinus,</hi>
who advis'd his Friends, especially those that were
Youthful, not to read the Bible; for it would be
of no use to them. But what it was that these
two Persons were employ'd about, which wholly
estrang'd their Minds from that Sacred Book,
may be guess'd from the<note n="†" place="bottom">In laudem Praeposter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

which the latter made, both which they publish'd
to the World. It is no wonder such Men disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
the Sacred Truths contain'd in the Inspired
Writings, and found fault with the Language and
Stile of them: this proceeded from their aversion
to that Purity and Holiness which those Holy
Writers urge upon the Practices of Men, and
which these two Vile <hi>Italians</hi> knew were directly
contrary to what they both loved and acted.
Who would not think the better of this Holy
Book, because it was despised and vilified by these
Men? Who would not highly esteem those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
which by such Dissolute Wretches as these
were scorn'd and trampl'd under Feet? If it was
an Argument that Christianity was Good because
<hi>Nero</hi> persecuted it, then we may with as much
reason infer, that the <hi>Bible</hi> is an Excellent Book,
because this pair of Lewd Varlets disparaged it.
This certainly was founded in the Wickedness
and Profaneness of their Lives. They could not
think or speak well of those Writings which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
their beloved Lusts and Vices. It was
thus with <hi>Ierom</hi> and <hi>Augustin,</hi> whilst they were
wicked and unreclaim'd Persons: the Scripture-Language
seem'd very harsh and unpleasant to
them; so far were they from discerning any
Elegancy in it. The former of these tells his <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stochium,</hi>
that he us'd, when he awaked in the Night,
and could not sleep, to read <hi>Plautus:</hi> and if after
that he read the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as sometimes he did,

that before his Conversion, the Stile of Scripture
was deemed by him very Rude and Unstudied,
and as having nothing Neat and Delicate in it.
This is the apprehension which those Men have of
it who are not Competent Judges: and they are
not so, not because they have not Understanding
enough, but because they have an Inward Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Sacred Verities which they find in
that Book. This is the true Reason why so many
in this Age, yea, within our own Borders, scoff at
and ridicule the Language of the Bible. The
Matter of this Volume makes them dislike the
Stile of it. Nothing can be Eloquent which speaks
against their Vices. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this most Excellent Book is depretiated by some
Vitious, or by some Half-witted Men, for there
are no other that ever spoke against it. In the
Stile of this Book of God, there are no Blemishes
but what are approved of in the Best Classical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
as those who were of the greatest Skill in
Grammar and Rhetorick have fully demonstrated:
therefore the Bible is not a Book to be disparag'd,
no, not by the greatest Grammarians and Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricians.
The Excellent and Choice Wording of
the Scripture is commended by St.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hom. 36. in Gen.</note> 
                        <hi>Chrysostom.</hi>
When I read the Bible, saith St.<note n="†" place="bottom">De doctr. Christ. l. ult. c. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Augustin,</hi> I find
that as nothing is more Wisely said, so nothing
is more Eloquently spoken than there. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
I have shew'd that it is beautified and
enrich'd with many <hi>Figures.</hi> Thus I have largely
proved, that the <hi>Stile</hi> of Scripture is generally of
the strain of Other Approved Writers as to its
Phraseology, or manner of Expression. I proceed,
and add,</p>

                        <hi>3dly.</hi> This Observation, that <hi>Proverbial Sayings</hi>
and commonly received <hi>Adagies</hi> used by other
Writers, are mention'd also in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
This is abundantly proved by<note n="*" place="bottom">Scottanus, Delrius, Drusius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> those who
have Purposely writ on this Subject. I will remit
you to them, and at present only confine my self
to the New Testament, and there to the <hi>Iewish
Proverbs</hi> only. Our Saviour in his excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

among the <hi>Iews,</hi> which was used in a Proverbial
way, <hi>No Man can serve two Masters,</hi> Mat. 6. 24.
which he applieth to a higher purpose than they
designed it, <hi>Ye cannot,</hi> saith he, <hi>serve God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
it is impossible you should be Servants to these

Service as he ought, and yet at the same time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
with the utmost Zeal and Concernedness the
things of this World; especially the Riches or
Profits of it: <hi>for either he will hate the one, and love
the other; or he will hold to the one, and despise the

                        <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 37. this very <hi>Proverb</hi> is spoken with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

Jewish Proverb, which was to this purpose,<note n="*" place="bottom">

This is too Evident an Argument of <hi>Hypocrisy;</hi>

an Excellent Lesson, and such as was very seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
at that time, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Disciples (for
to them chiefly he speaks in this Sermon) should
Prudently dispense the Gospel, and where they
saw it was obstinately refused by any, there they
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46315:326"/>
should not expose themselves to Dangers, when
they perceived that they could do no good among
such Persons. They must not throw away <hi>Pearls</hi>
among such <hi>Swine</hi> that <hi>would trample them under their
feet, and turn again, and rend them,</hi> as our Saviour
adds there. It was an Old Hebrew Proverb, near
of Kin to the former, <hi>It is not good to throw the
Childrens Bread to Dogs:</hi> which you find made use
of by our Saviour in <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 26. When the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of <hi>Canaan</hi> besought him in behalf of her
Daughter, who was grievously vexed with a Devil,
he put her off, by telling her, That he <hi>was not sent

she being an Alien from the Common-wealth of
<hi>Israel,</hi> had no right to the Privileges which were to
be dispens'd to these alone. <hi>It is not meet,</hi> saith
he, <hi>to take the Childrens Bread, and cast it to Dogs.</hi>
But this Woman would not be put off so, but
wisely retorted his Proverb by another Common

Crumbs which fall from their Master's Table.</hi> If she
might not have <hi>the Childrens Bread,</hi> she requested
he would not deny her that <hi>Common Allowance</hi>
which fell from his bountiful Hand, and which
she firmly <hi>believed</hi> he would not keep from her.
This <hi>great Faith</hi> of hers made her capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
this, and a higher Blessing from our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
Master. The Talmud uses that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbial
Saying, <hi>An Elephant cannot go through the Eye
of a Needle;</hi> but Christ instead of an <hi>Elephant</hi>
(which was an Animal that few saw in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try)
mentions a <hi>Camel,</hi> which was a Creature
well known; and he expresseth himself after a
Proverbial manner thus, <hi>It is easier for a Camel to
go through the Eye of a Needle, than for a rich Man to
enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mat. 19. 24. which
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46315:326"/>
in plainer terms he had said in the Verse before,
<hi>A rich Man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom of
Heaven;</hi> which is explain'd further in another
place, <hi>It is hard for them that trust in Riches to enter
into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mark 10. 24. It is hard,
yea, it is impossible, for you may as well draw a
Camel through the Eye of a small Needle. Those
are said to be Jewish Proverbs, <hi>The Disciple is not
above his Master, nor the Servant above his Lord,</hi>
Mat. 10. 24. <hi>They are blind Leaders of the Blind,</hi>
Mat. 15. 14. <hi>Ye strain at a Gnat, and swallow a
Camel,</hi> Mat. 23. 24. <hi>A Prophet hath no honour in
his own Country,</hi> John 4. 44. These and many
other Proverbial Speeches among the Jews, are
applied by our Saviour, he being pleas'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the Language as well as the Rites and
Usages of his Countrymen. Any one that hath
read the Books of the <hi>Mishnah,</hi> where the several
Sayings and Sentences of the Jewish Rabbies are
recorded, knows how near they come to sundry
Speeches and Expressions used by our Saviour.
That was an Old <hi>Hebrew</hi> Proverb, (though used
sometimes by Pagans) <hi>The Dog is return'd to his
Vomit again;</hi> and you find the same in St. <hi>Peter
(1 Ep. 2. 22.)</hi> who had it originally from <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
<hi>Proverbs,</hi> Chap. 26. 11. where it is used to express
a <hi>Fool's return to his Folly.</hi>

                     <p>To the <hi>Proverbial Sayings</hi> among the Jews, I may
refer that of our Saviour's bidding the Apostles
<hi>shake off the Dust of their Feet,</hi> Mat. 10. 14. or. <hi>under
their Feet,</hi> Mark 6. 11. which I have reserv'd for
this place, because I wil more distinctly speak of
it than I have of the rest. It was Christ's Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that when they came into a House or City,
and found not reception, they should behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in this manner; and he further tells them
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46315:327"/>
what they must say, <hi>Luk. 10. 11. Even the very Dust

Dust of the Feet</hi> or <hi>Shoes</hi> hath assinity with the
Jewish Rite of <hi>pulling off the Shoe,</hi> mention'd <hi>Deut.

performed by the Relict of the Deceased

and indeed, 'tis a wonder it hath had any, for
there is a vast difference between <hi>the shaking off
the Dust of the Feet,</hi> and <hi>the plucking off the Shoe.</hi>
Others think this Practice is of the same Nature
with <hi>shaking the Lap</hi> or Garment, which was an
usage among the Hebrews; and they would by this

from what we are speaking of, unless we can

                        </gap>
Saying of the Jews, That the Dust of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Land defiles a Man and makes him Unclean.
So that our Saviour bad the Apostles shake off
the Dust from their Feet, to shew how they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
those People, <hi>viz.</hi> as Heathenish and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
and consequently they were not to be
convers'd with. The Apostles scorn'd to have
any thing to do with them: and as a Sign of that,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46315:327"/>
they would not carry away any thing that belonged
to that Place, no not so much as the Dust of it.
But, if I may be permitted to offer my Thoughts,
there is something more in these Words than
this. It is true, this is signified that they would
not hold Correspondence with those unworthy
Persons that rejected the Gospel, they would not
suffer the very <hi>Dust</hi> of the Place to adhere to the
Soles of their Feet: but that is not all. It is
further and more particularly signified, that
the Apostles were <hi>to leave the Place speedily.</hi> When
they are commanded <hi>to shake off the Dust of their
Feet,</hi> the more especial Meaning is, that they must
stay no longer in the Place, but be gone from it
with all the <hi>Expedition</hi> they can, and they must not
carry so much as the Dust to burden them. It is
something related (as I apprehend) to that other
Counsel of our Saviour, in the very same Chapter;
or rather, it seems to be the same, but mentioned
again in other terms, (as is usual with our Lord)
<hi>When they persecute you in one City, flee ye into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
ver. 23. with what <hi>Speed</hi> you can depart from
the Place where you are so ill used. When you
find that your Preaching is wholly despised, make
no Delay, but hasten away, that you may be in a
Capacity to do good in some other Places, where
you may be kindly received. As soon as you see
your Message is scorn'd and rejected, <hi>shake the Dust
off your Feet,</hi> and be gone away immediately. This
seems to be the genuine Tendency of the Words;
for we must know that <hi>Iudea</hi> (some part of it
especially) was a dry, hot and dusty Countrey,
whence it was a Custom among them to have their
Feet wash'd as soon as they came into a House: this
was part of the Welcome which they look'd for;
and when this Ceremony was omitted, they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46315:328"/>
thence that they were Unacceptable Guests.
Therefore, saith Christ, if you find not this Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
if your Feet are not wash'd, and the Dust
wiped off by some of the House, do this part your
selves, (that thereby you may be somewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh'd)
lightly shake off some of the Dust, and
go your way, and leave the Habitation forthwith.
So that these Words denote <hi>Haste</hi> and <hi>Expedition;</hi>
which may be confirmed from that Saying of the
Jews, which they used in Traffick, <hi>Whilst the Dust
is on your Feet</hi> (before 'tis all wiped off) <hi>sell what you
have,</hi> i. e. sell <hi>quickly.</hi> So <hi>Pie-Powder-Court</hi> among
us, which is incident to every Fair and Market (as
a Court Baron to a Mannor) is that where Causes
are tried cursorily and in haste. This <hi>Dusty-foot-
Court</hi> is so call'd to signify the Quickness of Dispatch
in it. Thus among the Greek Lawyers <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
(rendred by the Latins <hi>Pedaneus Iudex)</hi> was a
sorry, mean, inferiour Judg, a <hi>Pedant</hi> in Law,
that judged standing on foot on the plain Ground,
and had not a Chair or Tribunal: he judg'd, as it
were, <hi>in transitu,</hi> passing, going on foot. He was
a Judg of the Court of <hi>Pie Powder, pedis pulverisati,</hi>
as our Lawyers call it, because they came to it in
haste, and had no time to wipe off the Dirt which
they contracted in their Travels. Thus there is
some Analogy between this way of speaking, and
that which I am now treating of. Our Saviour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseth
his Travelling Apostles to use Prudence, to
be gone, as fast as they could, out of those Cities
and Towns where the Inhabitants were wholly
averse to the Preaching of the Gospel, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when they saw it would be attended with Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.
And we read that the Apostles put this
in practice when they were at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where they
were severely handled, and saw they should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46315:328"/>
out of those Coasts, <hi>they shook off the Dust of
their Feet against them, and came to</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>conium in all
haste, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 50, 51. This was a Sign of <hi>Speed:</hi>
and so the Meaning of Christ's Injunction was, that
when they perceived the Gospel was rejected, and
themselves were in great Danger, they should <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently</hi>
depart from the Place, and stay no longer
among such vile People. But withal, I deny not
that this was to be <hi>for a Testimony against them,</hi> as
'tis said, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 11. it was to bear witness against
the Despisers of the Gospel, and the Persecutors
of the holy Professors of it. And moreover, it
was a Token of Contempt and Abhorrence, and
(with reference to a Jewish Saying before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd)
might be spoken in a <hi>Proverbial</hi> way. Lastly,
it might be shew'd here, that many of <hi>Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables</hi>
(of which I have treated before) were bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
from the <hi>Iewish Doctors.</hi> That of <hi>Dives</hi> and

is mentioned in the same Place, in the Title
<hi>Beracoth:</hi> and that of the <hi>five wise and five foolish
Virgins</hi> is spoken of in the Book of the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> and
some others might be instanc'd in, but I will add
no more under this Head.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>There is in Scripture a great and delightful Variety of
Languages. Some Chapters and Verses of the Old
Testament are in Chaldee. Here are Persian, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frican,
Arabick, Syriac, Phoenician Words. In
the New Testament there are some Hebrew and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,
many Latin and Syriac Words. Hebraisms,
i. e. Phrases proper to the Hebrews, are not only in
the Old Testament, (where many Examples are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced)
but in the New; where (besides many other
Hebrew Modes of Speech) the Vse of God's Name
to augment and inhanse the Sense, the Vse of the
word Sons or Children, not only applied to Persons
but Things; the Import of the word first-born or
first-begotten, and of those Expressions, the Son
of Man, a Weight of Glory, are chiefly insisted
upon. There are no Soloecisms in Scripture. St. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,
Erasmus, Calvin, Beza, Castellio, Dr.
Hammond censured for asserting the contrary. Sir
Norton Knatchbull salves the Grammatical Part
of the New Testament, and olears it of Soloecisms.
The same things which some call Soloecisms and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
Syntax, are found in the best Classical Authors.
There are Chasms, Expletives, Repetitions, and at
other times unexpected Brevity, seeming Inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Incoherencies in the best Greek and Latin Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.

There are in the Old Testament, besides
the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> (of which it is composed) many Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
written in <hi>Chaldee:</hi> as in <hi>Ezra,</hi> part of the <hi>4th</hi>
Chapter, all the <hi>5th</hi> and <hi>6th,</hi> with part of the <hi>7th:</hi>
in <hi>Daniel,</hi> the greatest part of the <hi>2d</hi> Chapter, and
all the rest that follow till the <hi>8th:</hi> in <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> one
single Verse, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>11th</hi> of the <hi>10th</hi> Chapter.
And besides these greater Portions, there are many
<hi>Chaldee Words</hi> dispersed up and down in several
Places, as <hi>Chartummim,</hi> Magicians, Astrologers,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 24. used also in <hi>Dan. 1. 20. ch. 2. 2. Nishtevan,</hi>

<hi>Ier.</hi> 51. 27. and some think <hi>Macha,</hi> Numb.

From <hi>Egypt</hi> (with which the Hebrews had great
Commerce) several Words are borrowed, as <hi>Zaph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nath
Paaneah,</hi> Gen. 41. 45. the Title of Honour

'tis not to be doubted that 'tis <hi>Egyptian,</hi> for a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

The Names of the <hi>Months</hi> among the Hebrews
(several of which occur in the Old Testament) are
generally taken from other Languages. And many
other foreign Words are brought into the Hebrew
Tongue, and mix'd with it, (which was caused by
Correspondence with other Nations, of whom
they were taught these Words, and particularly
by Traffick and Importing of foreign Goods, as
<note n="*" place="bottom">Cum rebus exoticis vocabula etiam peregrina importan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Heb. Lex.</note> 
                        <hi>Avenarius</hi> has observed, the Things and the Names
being brought at the same time from foreign Parts)
and accordingly we find them in the Writings of
the Old Testament. Here that of the Rabbies is
true, (though they applied it, as I have shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in another Sense) <hi>The Scripture oftentimes
speaks in the Language of the Sons of Men;</hi> it hath
Words which are used in other Tongues, and
borrowed from other Nations.</p>
                     <p>Thus likewise it is in the New Testament; there

Words (and many more without doubt) came in

hence it is not to be marvell'd at that many Roman

2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. is also of Syriac Original. Nor is it
a wonder that we find a great Number of these in
the Greek Testament; for after the Return of the
Jews from their Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
was mix'd of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chaldee,</hi> and
named the <hi>Syriac</hi> Tongue, from the Regions where
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46315:331"/>
it was used. As for the Old Pure Hebrew, the
Priests and the Learned Jews only understood it,
but this Mix'd Tongue was that which was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
spoken and understood by all the Jewish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Therefore in this Tongue Christ made all
his Sermons to the People, and the Evangelists and
Apostles preach'd the Gospel to them in it. Yea,
because the <hi>Syriac</hi> succeeded in the place of the
<hi>Hebrew,</hi> (the Jews having lost this, and taken up
that) therefore that Tongue is sometimes call'd
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue in the New Testament, as in
<hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 13. where it is said, Pilate <hi>sat down in the
Iudgment-seat, in a Place that is called the Pavement,
but in the Hebrew</hi> Gabbatha. This is a <hi>Syriac</hi> Word,
or a Dialect of the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> (which is the same)
but it is call'd <hi>Hebrew</hi> here, because Syriac was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Vulgar Language of the Hebrews; yea,
was their Mother-Tongue in our Saviour's time.
So when 'tis said, that the Title on the Cross was
<hi>written in Letters of Hebrew,</hi> Luke 23. 38. 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the <hi>Syriac</hi> is meant, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Superscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was written in <hi>Syriac</hi> Words, though in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rew
Letters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>5thly.</hi> It is useful to observe what a considerable
Number of <hi>Hebraisms, i. e.</hi> of Phrases proper to
the Hebrews is made use of in these Holy Writings,
not in those of the Old Testament only, but in the
Greek Writings of the New. Indeed the Books
of the Old and New Testament being written by
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> we cannot expect but that they should use
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> way of speaking. Such is that in <hi>Gen.</hi>
40. 13. Pharaoh <hi>shall lift up thy Head, To lift up
the Head,</hi> is to Account or Reckon, for (as some
tell us) they used to cast Accompts with Nails or
Pins, stuck in a Table with Holes, and these Pins
were call'd <hi>Heads:</hi> by the <hi>lifting them up,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46315:332"/>
them out of one Hole to another, they
performed their Arithmetick. Therefore <hi>Moses</hi>
expresses it thus, <hi>He lifted up the Head of the chief
Butler and chief Baker,</hi> ver. 20. that is, he <hi>Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with them,</hi> and then differently dealt with them,
<hi>viz.</hi> according to their Deserts. The same Phrase
is used in <hi>Exod. 30. 12. When thou takest the Sum of
the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>Hebr.</hi> When thou liftest
up the Head: And so in <hi>Numb. 1. 2. take the Sum,
Hebr.</hi> Lift up the Head. It is a peculiar Mode
of Speech to signify <hi>to reckon,</hi> to gather the Sum of
all; to which answer the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and
the Latin <hi>recapitulare,</hi> to bring all to one, <hi>Head,</hi>
which were borrowed from the Hebrew Stile. <hi>To
fill the Hand,</hi> Exod. 28. 41. <hi>ch. 29. 9. Numb.</hi> 3. 3.
is a way of speaking proper to the Hebrews, and
we fitly render it <hi>to consecrate,</hi> because, perhaps,
when they Consecrated Persons, they delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Hands the Badges and Instruments of their
Office. Another peculiar Phrase is used in 2 <hi>Kings
10. 21. ch. 21. 16. Ezra</hi> 9. 11. which, according
to the Hebrew is, <hi>from Mouth to Mouth,</hi> or <hi>Mouth
to Mouth,</hi> but it particularly denotes <hi>a Place to be
full of People;</hi> and accordingly is so rendred, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
for this Reason, because when it is so, they
stand close together, as it were <hi>Mouth to Mouth.
To give the Hand to one,</hi> was heretofore a way of
Expression proper to the Eastern Countries, the
Hebrews especially; and it was as much as <hi>to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi>
or <hi>yield to one,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 24. <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. 15.
<hi>Lam.</hi> 5. 6. and it is applied in a spiritual way,
2 Chron. 30. 8. <hi>give the Hand,</hi> or <hi>yield your selves
unto the Lord.</hi> The same Phrase is used by Gentile
Authors: <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>dare manus,</hi> is to
confess one's self to be overcome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="201" facs="tcp:46315:332"/>The Form of <hi>Wishing</hi> among the Hebrews is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,

Exod.</hi> 16. 3. which we translate <hi>would to God:</hi> So
<hi>Numb. 11. 29. Deut. 28. 67. Iob 13. 5. O that ye
would! Benjamin</hi> is call'd a <hi>Lad,</hi> Gen. 43. 8. though
he was Four and twenty Years old, and had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
the Idiom of the Hebrew Tongue solves it.
To this peculiar manner of phrasing things may
be referr'd <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10.—<hi>Nor a Lawgiver from
between his Feet.</hi> For so the Hebrews modestly
express the place of Generation, stiling it <hi>Rage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim,</hi>
the Feet: and so the word seems to be meant
in <hi>Exod. 4. 25. Deut. 28. 57. Isa.</hi> 6. 2. and thus
the <hi>Masorites,</hi> for the word which is used for
<hi>Vrine,</hi> read in the Margin <hi>the Water of the Feet,
2 Kings</hi> 18. 27. And sometimes instead of <hi>Feet,</hi>
the Hebrews use the word <hi>Thigh,</hi> Gen. 46. 26.
Exod. 1. 5. and <hi>Loins,</hi> Gen. 35. 11. and in a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of other places. Moreover, the peculiar
way of using the word <hi>Sons</hi> among the Hebrews is
remarkable; as in <hi>Prov. 31. 5. Sons of Affliction,
i. e.</hi> the Afflicted: <hi>Sons of Destruction,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>Such
as are appointed to be destroy'd,</hi> as we render it:
<hi>Sons of Oil,</hi> Zech. 4. 14. <hi>i. e.</hi> the anointed ones.
So we read of <hi>the Son of the Morning,</hi> Isa. 14. 12.
and <hi>the Sons of Belial,</hi> Judg. 19. 22. 2. Sam. 23. 6.
And sometimes 'tis applied to Things as well as
Persons, as in <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 7. [<hi>As the Sons of the burning
Coal,</hi> i. e. the Sparks, <hi>fly upward.</hi>] Whatever is
the <hi>part</hi> of a thing, or whoever <hi>belongs to</hi> any
thing, or is <hi>partaker of</hi> it, is in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Idiom
call'd a <hi>Son.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, the <hi>Name of God</hi> after the Hebrew manner,
is wont to be added, to Magnify and Augment the
Signification in several places of Scripture. There
have been some Instances of this sort produced by
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46315:333"/>
Critical Writers on the Bible, but I will endeavour
here (and afterwards) to make a considerable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to them. But first I will take notice of a
place or two which have been brought under this
Head, but in my judgment belong not to it. Such
is that, <hi>Gen. 10. 9. He was a mighty Hunter before
the Lord,</hi> where (saith<note n="*" place="bottom">Drusius in Proverb. Hebraic. Class. 2.</note> One) the Name of the
<hi>Lord</hi> is added to heighten the sense, as is frequent
in the Hebrew Stile. But two things I here urge
to enervate this Interpretation: First, It is not
the bare Name of <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Lord</hi> that is here added,
as in other Texts. The exact rendring of <hi>Lipni
Iehovah</hi> (which are the words here) is <hi>ad facies,
ad conspectum Domini,</hi> and is well translated <hi>before
the Lord,</hi> which signifies the bold and impudent
Usurpation and Tyranny of this first Monarch.
This hardned Oppressor had no regard either to
God or Man; yea, he committed his Violences and
Ravages in defiance of the Great Lord and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
of the World: this is to be a Hunter, a
Persecutor, a Tyrant <hi>before the Lord:</hi> and so you
see it is not that <hi>Hebraism</hi> we are now to treat of.
Secondly, There was no need of that way of Speech
here, for the Greatning and Heightning of the
sense, were before express'd by the term <hi>Gibbor,
mighty:</hi> wherefore there was no occasion to add
the <hi>Name of God</hi> as a mark of Intension. If you
observe the Instances which I shall afterward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
you will find that <hi>God's Name</hi> is used when
there was no word to express <hi>Greatness</hi> or <hi>Eminency</hi>
in the preceding words. For these Reasons, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge
this first Text out of the Number of the
Instances which ought to be mention'd here. And
after the same rate I must deal with that other,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46315:333"/>
                        <hi>Prov. 20. 27. The Spirit of Man is the Candle of the
Lord:</hi> where the last word is asserted by a late
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Sir</hi> N. Knatchbull <hi>A mot at. on</hi> 2 Cor. 10.</note> Learned Critick to be added (in which he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<hi>Drusius</hi> in his <hi>Hebrew Proverbs</hi>) as an <hi>Auxesis,</hi>
that is, only to augment the sense: and therefore
he saith, <hi>the Candle of the Lord</hi> is no more than <hi>a
most Excellent Candle</hi> or <hi>Light.</hi> But if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the words aright, we shall not find such an
<hi>Hebraism</hi> in them. The Text is easie and plain,
without any thing of this Nature; for the Wise
Man here acquaints us, that <hi>the Spirit of Man,</hi> his
Nobler and Divine part, the Intellect especially,
that Bright and Glorious Faculty was given to him
<hi>by God,</hi> on purpose to be a Light and Guide to him,
to make him capable of enquiring into and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a knowledge of the Profoundest Truths, the
most remote and recondite Mysteries either in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or Religion: that is meant here by <hi>searching
all the inward Parts of the Belly.</hi> Thus the Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Mind of Man is the <hi>Candle</hi> or <hi>Lamp of the
Lord;</hi> the word <hi>Lord</hi> here signifying to us the
Author and Giver of this Noble Faculty. And
therefore I something wonder at what this Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Writer adds in the same place, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>our
English Translation [the Spirit of Man is the Candle
of the Lord] is an odd Expression, and somewhat diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
surely to make a good sense of;</hi> whereas the same
Expression is used in the Scripture in other places,
and bears a very good sense, as you have heard.
Some have thought that <hi>Musical Instruments of God,
1 Chron.</hi> 16. 42. and <hi>Instruments of Musick of the
Lord, 2 Chron.</hi> 7. 6. denote the <hi>Loudness</hi> or <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi>
of the Temple-Musick; but this Fancy arose
from their not attending to the true Reason which
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46315:334"/>
is given in the latter of these places, where after
<hi>Instruments of Musick of the Lord</hi> is immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<hi>which</hi> David <hi>the King had made to Praise the
Lord;</hi> therefore they were so call'd. Nor can I
be perswaded that <hi>a Man of God,</hi> which we often
read of, imports only an <hi>Excellent Man,</hi> as some
have suggested; but it speaks his more particular
and peculiar Relation to God as a Prophet.</p>
                     <p>I come now to offer some Examples where the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> way of Speaking, by mentioning <hi>God</hi> to
signify the Greatness or Excellency of a thing,
is very apparent and unquestionable; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 8.
<hi>Wrestlings of God,</hi> according to the Hebrew, <hi>i. e.</hi>
great, strong and vehement Wrestlings: 1 <hi>Sam.
14. 15. a Trembling of God,</hi> which we rightly
translate <hi>a very great Trembling:</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 5. <hi>the
Hill of God:</hi> Psal. 36. 6. <hi>the Mountains of God,</hi> i. e.
the great Hills and Mountains. <hi>Cedars of God,
Psal.</hi> 80. 10. rendred <hi>goodly: the Trees of the Lord,</hi>
Psal. 104. 16. <hi>i. e.</hi> exceeding great or high Trees.
To which Texts (that are generally acknowledg'd
to bear this sense) I will presume to add another,
<hi>viz.</hi> Psal. 65. 9. <hi>the River of God,</hi> i. e. a Vast Great
River. And what is that? The Clouds or Rain,
which are poured down upon the Earth in great
abundance. For if you read that part of the
Psalm, you'll see it speaks of the great Blessing of
<hi>Rain, Thou visitest the Earth, and waterest it, thou
greatly enrichest it with the River of God,</hi> &amp;c. to the
end of the Psalm. This Vast Mass of Waters is
according to the Hebrews stiled <hi>a River of God:</hi>
it is as 'twere a Great Excellent River flowing
down from Heaven: Though I do not exclude
the other sense contain'd in it, that 'tis <hi>from God,</hi>
and that 'tis a singular Argument and Token of
God's Care and Providence. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 6. is a place
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46315:334"/>
little taken notice of, <hi>the Flame of the Lord,</hi> i. e.
(as we truly translate it) <hi>a most Vehement Flame.</hi>
So <hi>the Voice of God,</hi> Ezek. 1. 24. &amp; 10. 5. that is, a
very loud and terrible Voice. <hi>The Breath of God,</hi>
Job 37. 10. i. e. <hi>a Vehement sharp Wind.</hi> And it
is not unlikely that <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 19. is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
thus, <hi>Ruach Iehovah,</hi> (not, as we translate
it, <hi>the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> but) <hi>the Wind of the Lord,
i. e.</hi> a great tempestuous Wind. I gather this to
be the meaning from what went before, <hi>when the
Enemy shall come in like a Floud,</hi> then (saith the
Prophet) the Almighty Power of God, like some
Great and Vehement <hi>Wind,</hi> shall drive it back,
shall put it to flight, as we see great Waters
and Floods are oftentimes beat back (as well as
violently thrust forward) by mighty Winds.
Another place which hath not been observed, is
<hi>Iob 15. 11. Are the Consolations of God small with
thee?</hi> which are <hi>Eliphaz</hi>'s words wherewith he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
<hi>Iob</hi> for undervaluing the Consolatory Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
which had been offer'd to him by himself
and his other Friends: and these Topicks of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
were not mean and ordinary, but of a very
peculiar Nature. <hi>Iob</hi>'s Fault is aggravated from
this, that he despised and slighted so <hi>Great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi>
when they were tender'd to him: and <hi>Great</hi>
they were, (as you read in the <hi>9th</hi> and <hi>10th</hi> Verses)
because they were offer'd by Persons of <hi>great Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
Age,</hi> and <hi>Experience.</hi> And the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>
which is here, doth shew this to be the sense
of the place; Are these <hi>Great</hi> Consolations, saith
he, <hi>Small</hi> with thee? Dost thou look for Greater
and Stronger Arguments to support and cheer
thee than these are? I am of opinion therefore
that <hi>Tanchumoth El, the Consolations of God,</hi> are the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:46315:335"/>
same with <hi>Great Consolations.</hi> Jon. 3. 3. is a known
Text, where it is said, <hi>Nine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

great City,</hi> Hebr. <hi>great to God. A Land of
Darkness of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 2. 31. is as much as a
Land of very great and signal Darkness; for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi>
is here compounded with <hi>Iah,</hi> to express
the Superlative Degree of Darkness. So in the
words <hi>Er<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

fortis,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 20. <hi>El</hi> the Name of God is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to inhanse the Signification. So <hi>Iacob</hi> was
Sirnamed <hi>Israel,</hi> i. e. <hi>a Prince of God,</hi> which is
equivalent with <hi>a Great Prince,</hi> one that mightily
prevail'd, even with God himself. Hither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
may be reduced <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> Gen. 6. 2.
Great Men, of high Stature, the <hi>Giants</hi> mention'd
<hi>ver.</hi> 4. but call'd here <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> according to
the Idiom of the Hebrews, who set forth the
Greatness and Largeness, as also the transcendent
Worth and Excellency of Persons and Things by
joining the Name of <hi>God</hi> to them. To this way
of speaking, I refer <hi>Tardemah Iehovah,</hi> 1 Sam. 26.
12. english'd by our Translators, <hi>a deep Sleep from
the Lord;</hi> but according to the Hebrew, it is <hi>a Sleep
of the Lord,</hi> i. e. a Great Sleep, <hi>Sopor vehemens,</hi> as
<hi>Arius Montanus</hi> renders it, a Profound Sleep, out
of which a Person is not easily awaked. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>a deep Sleep,</hi> or <hi>a very deep Sleep</hi> will be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
without adding <hi>from</hi> or <hi>of the Lord.</hi> To
this also may be referr'd <hi>lechem abirim,</hi> Psal. 78. 25.
<hi>the Bread</hi> or <hi>Food of Angels,</hi> i. e. Excellent Food:
for what is Excellent, is said to be <hi>Angelical</hi> as well
as <hi>Divine.</hi> And indeed these are the same here,
for <hi>Abirim</hi> is of the same import with <hi>Elohim,</hi> and
as the Name of <hi>God,</hi> is used to augment the sense.

<hi>Great</hi> is express'd: <hi>Sacra anchora</hi> is <hi>the greater,</hi> and
consequently the stronger and safer Anchor, the
last and only hope of the Ship and Mariners. And
some Criticks have thought that <hi>Sacra fames</hi> is
the same with <hi>ingens, insatiabilis;</hi> for those things
which are <hi>Great</hi> are said to be <hi>Sacred,</hi> and to be <hi>of
God.</hi>

So among the later Physicians and Botanists, you

to set forth some things which they have a great

to extol and magnify their Simples and their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
Applications. All this seems to be derived
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46315:336"/>
from the antient Stile of the Hebrews, by whom
that which is <hi>Greatest in its kind</hi> is call'd <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
and accordingly (as <hi>R. D. Kimchi</hi> notes in
his Comment on 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.) <hi>the Sacred Scripture,
when it would magnify a thing, joins with it God's

                     </p>
                     <p>But it is endless to insist on the <hi>Old Testament:</hi>
and therefore I will confine my self to the <hi>New,</hi>
and briefly shew you that this part of the Bible,
though written in <hi>Greek,</hi> abounds with <hi>Hebraisms:</hi>
(and yet here still I shall have occasion to refer to
the Writings of the Old Testament all along.) The
Reason why the Evangelists and Apostles writ in
<hi>Greek,</hi> was, because this was the Tongue generally
used by all sorts of Nations, but you will find that
they accommodated it to the guise of the <hi>Hebrew
Tongue;</hi> that is, they retained many of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Idioms, and made use of them in the Greek
Language. Thus <hi>to be called</hi> and <hi>to be</hi> are the
same among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and this latter is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in<note n="*" place="bottom">Isa. 60. 14, 18. Ch. 61. 3. Ch. 62. 12. Zech. 8. 3.</note> the Old Testament, express'd by the
former. Accordingly these are oftentimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive
one of another in the New Testament, as
in <hi>Mat. 5. 9. they shall be called the Children of God:</hi>
and <hi>ver. 19. he shall be called the least in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven.</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 1.—that <hi>we should be call'd
the Sons of God. To be called</hi> here and in other
places is <hi>really to be,</hi> and it is so express'd accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> way of speaking. There is
the like signification of the word [<hi>arise</hi>], as in
2 <hi>Sam. 11. 20. if the King's Wrath arise:</hi> Esth. 4. 14.
<hi>Enlargement and Deliverance shall arise to the Iews:</hi>
Prov. 24. 22. <hi>their Calamity shall rise suddenly.</hi> In
all which places the word [arise] signifies no other
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46315:336"/>
than actual <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Existing,</hi> according to the
Hebrew Idiom. And thence it is used so in the
New Testament, as in <hi>Luke 24. 38. Why do Thoughts
arise in your Hearts?</hi> i. e. why <hi>are</hi> they there?
<hi>Mat. 24. 24. There shall arise false Christs,</hi> i. e. there
shall <hi>actually be</hi> at that time such Persons, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my Prediction. So [to be found] is among
the Hebrews of the same import with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Expressions, and accordingly in the Old
Testament one is put for the other, as in 1 <hi>Sam.

who use this way of expressing themselves, and
from whom some Heathen Authors have derived
it, as may be seen in some of their Writings.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46315:337"/>
Next, we may take notice of that <hi>Hebraism</hi> in
the New Testament, which I observ'd before to
be in the Old one, <hi>viz.</hi> the using of <hi>God's Name</hi>
to augment and inhanse a thing. Of this Nature
seems to be that in <hi>Acts 7. 20. Moses was fair to
God;</hi> for so 'tis according to the Greek, but is
fitly rendred by our English Translators [<hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fair:</hi>] for the Name of <hi>God</hi> being here adjoined
advanceth the sense, and denotes to us that <hi>Moses</hi>
was transcendently and superlatively Fair, he was
a Child of Extraordinary Beauty, he was (as the
French Version hath it) <hi>divinement beau,</hi> divinely
beautiful, of most Astonishing and Divine Features.
The like Expression, I conceive, is that of the
Apostle, when he saith, <hi>The Lord shall descend from
Heaven with a Shout, with the Voi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           </gap>h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel,
and with the Trumpet of God,</hi> 1 Thess. 4. 16.
This <hi>Trumpet of God</hi> may be that kind of Hebraism
whereby the Greatness and Wonderfulness of a
thing are expressed, by adding the Name of <hi>God</hi>
to it. And accordingly in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. (which gives
us an account of the Signs of the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
you read that <hi>the Son of Man shall send his
Angels with a Great sound of a Trumpet,</hi> ver. 31.
which is the same that the Apostle calls <hi>the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
of God.</hi> Of this sort is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>I am zealous toward you with a Zeal of God,
i. e.</hi> I exceedingly affect you, in an extraordinary
manner I am Zealous for you. So <hi>the Harps of
God,</hi> Rev. 15. 2. are Excellent Heavenly Musick.
And I will offer one Place more (which I think
may be referr'd to this Head) <hi>Iohn 6. 28, 29. the
Works of God,</hi> i. e. Some Great and Eminent Works
of Religion, which surpass all others. Thus you
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:46315:337"/>
see that <hi>God's</hi> Name is used in the Sacred Stile,
as an Intensive Term, and to Aggrandize the thing
which is spoken of.</p>
                     <p>So in Conformity to the Hebrew Phrase in the
Old Testament (mention'd before) we read of <hi>the
Sons</hi> or <hi>Children</hi> of this or that: which signifies,
according to the Hebrew Propriety of Speech, that
they are <hi>Sharers</hi> or <hi>Partakers of</hi> such a thing, or that
they are <hi>obnoxious</hi> and <hi>liable to</hi> it, or that they
have great <hi>Inclination</hi> and <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

<hi>Conversant in</hi> it, or <hi>much given and addicted to</hi> it,
or do in a special manner <hi>belong and appertain to</hi> it.
In one or other of these Senses the following places
are to be understood, <hi>the Children of the Bride-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
Mat. 9. 15 <hi>i. e.</hi> those that <hi>belong'd to it,</hi> and had
the favour to be admitted into it; those that were
invited to the Marriage, and were interested in
the Bridegroom and Bride; <hi>the Children of Hell,
Mat. 23. 15. i. e.</hi> those that are liable to it, and
shall partake of its Torments: or it is as much as
<hi>the Children of the Devil,</hi> i. e. those who have given
themselves to him by a voluntary addicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to Vice: <hi>the Children of Wisdom,</hi> Luk. 7. 35.
those that are conversant in it: <hi>the Sons of Peace,
Luk.</hi> 10. 6. such who addict themselves to Peace, or
who shall be sharers in the Blessing of Peace: <hi>the
Children of this World,</hi> Luk. 16. 8. those whose In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
and Desires are chiefly after this World;
to whom are opposed, in the same Verse, <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Light,</hi> they who despise this dark World
here below, and breath and long after the Light
and Glory of another State, of a future Life: <hi>the
Children of the Resurrection,</hi> Luk. 20. 36. those who
have a part, a share in the blessed Resurrection to
Life everlasting: <hi>Children of Disobedience,</hi> Eph. 5. 6.
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 6. those that give themselves up wholl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46315:338"/>
Disobediencce, the same with <hi>Sons of</hi> Belial, before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned:
<hi>the Sons of Perdition,</hi> John 17. 12.
2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3. those that are certainly liable to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and Destruction: <hi>Children of Promise,</hi> Rom.
9. 8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 28. those who shall share in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise:
<hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. those who are
liable to God's Wrath. This is the Hebrew way
of speaking: he is call'd <hi>the Son</hi> of this or that,
who hath some <hi>special relation</hi> to it. That also sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of the Hebrew Idiom, <hi>Are ye able to drink of
the Cup that I shall drink of?</hi> Mat. 20. 22. &amp; Joh.
18. 11. <hi>The Cup which my Father hath given me, shall
I not drink</hi> it? <hi>If it be possible, let this Cup pass
from me,</hi> Mat. 26. 39. And you read of <hi>the Cup
of the Wine of the fierceness of God's Wrath,</hi> Rev. 16.
19. And again, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. 10. &amp; <hi>Ch.</hi> 18. 6. The
<hi>Cup</hi> signifies with the Hebrews any thing good or
bad that befals a Man: because those of the same
Family or Table drink of the same Cup or Vessel;
every one hath his part and share of it, better or
worse, as the Drink is. And so the Phrase denotes
either the <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> that happens to us, but most
commonly the latter. Or perhaps, the occasion
of the Phrase was this; the Guests had antiently
their certain Quantity and Measure of Drink and
Meat appointed them at Feasts, by the Master or
Governour of the Feast: from which Custom of
distributing a certain Portion, God is said to <hi>Give</hi>
or <hi>Distribute his Cup:</hi> and the <hi>Cup</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> are
used for the Calamities and Sufferings which he is
pleased to allot them. So our Saviour's Words are
to be understood; <hi>the Cup which he was to drink,</hi> and
which his Father <hi>gave</hi> him, was the Sufferings
which he was to undergo. <hi>The Cup of the Wine of
the Fierceness of God's Wrath,</hi> was no other than the
Plagues and Judgments which were to be inflicted
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46315:338"/>
on Mystical <hi>Babylon.</hi> This manner of Speaking was
taken from the Old Testament, where you read
of <hi>the Cup of God's Fury,</hi> and <hi>the Cup of Trembling,</hi>

to the King Eternal,</hi> or, as 'tis in the Original, <hi>to
the King of Ages:</hi> which is an Expression to set
forth Eternity. Accordingly the Psalmist saith,
<hi>Thy Kingdom is a Kingdom of all Ages,</hi> which we
rightly translate, <hi>an everlasting Kingdom,</hi> Psal.
145. 13. <hi>In the Lord Iehovah is the Rock,</hi> or

<hi>Bread</hi> is the general word in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to signify all Food and Provision for the

our Lord taught his Disciples, <hi>Give us this Day our

<hi>Ch. 9. 3. Ch. 14. 1. 2 Thess.</hi> 3. 12. and in other
places: which is according to the Idiom of the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> with whom all Food is call'd <hi>lechem, Bread,</hi>
because this is the most Common and Universal
Food, and the most necessary for the Life of Man:
and this word with them denotes all the Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Conveniencies of Humane Life.</p>
                     <p>According to the Hebrew Stile, a <hi>Sword</hi> hath a

Luk. 21. 24. <hi>They shall fall by the Mouth</hi> (we rightly

                        </gap>, the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the Sword. So you read of a

                        </gap> in
the Greek. Which is the Hebrew Phraseology, as
you may satisfy your selves from <hi>Iudg. 3. 16. Psal.
149. 6. Prov.</hi> 5. 4. A Sword is said to have a
<hi>Mouth</hi> because it <hi>Devours:</hi> So <hi>lacham</hi> is both to

                     </p>
                     <p>As I observ'd before that <hi>Drinking</hi> was applied
to Calamity or Suffering, so now I will remark
that <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> are sometimes meant of
Holy Instruction, of Divine Grace, and the most
Excellent things of Religion. <hi>Eat up the Book,</hi>
Rev. 10. 9. <hi>i. e.</hi> Study it diligently, understand
the Contents of it. Our Saviour expresses his
Holy Doctrines, his Gifts and Graces, the Favour
of God, and all Spiritual Comforts, yea, Himself
too by <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink. I have Meat to eat which
ye know not of,</hi> saith he, <hi>Iohn 4. 32. My Meat is to
do the Will of him that sent me,</hi> ver. 34. He advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<hi>to labour for the Meat which endureth to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Life,</hi> John 6. 27. And in four Verses to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the same Chapter, he uses this Phrase,
<hi>Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drink
his Blood, ye have no Life in you. Whoso eateth my
Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, hath Eternal Life. For
my Flesh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed.
He that eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth
in me.</hi> Ver. 53, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he promiseth his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
that they shall <hi>eat and drink with him at his
Table in his Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 22. 30. All which is
according to the Language of the Antient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
who by <hi>Eating</hi> and <hi>Drinking</hi> express things
of a Spiritual and Divine Nature, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.

in <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15. where he is call'd the <hi>First-born of
every Creature. Erasmus</hi> read it <gap reason="foreign">

<note n="†" place="bottom">Lib. 3. Epist. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>Isidore</hi> of <hi>Pelusium,</hi> who evaded the <hi>Arians</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
by this means. But this is an undue Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
because it alters the received Accent of
the Word without any warrant, and because in
other places where this Word is, and is applied to
Christ, this alteration is not admitted by those
that make use of it here. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> and
others, interpret the <hi>First-born of every Creature</hi>
thus, He whom God the Father begot before he
created any thing: He that existed before all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
But this seems not to be the sense of the
words, because <hi>to be begotten before all Creatures,</hi>
and <hi>to be the First-born of them,</hi> are two different
things. Others think <hi>the First-born</hi> here is Synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
with <hi>the Beginner</hi> or <hi>Author,</hi> (which falls in
with the Interpretation of St. <hi>Isidore</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd)
and accordingly they quote that as a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46315:340"/>
Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 14. where Christ is call'd <hi>the
beginning of the Creation of God,</hi> i. e. the Cause and
Author of all Creatures, say they. But this (though
it be very true) is not agreeable with the sense of
the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which is no where found to
be taken thus. Nor is <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Gloss to be allowed
of, who expounds it thus, <hi>Christ is the first in the
new Creation:</hi> for the Context shews that there is
relation to no such thing. But if we consult the
antient acception of the Word among the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Writers of the Old Testament, we shall discover
what the genuine meaning of it is in this place.
The <hi>First-Born</hi> is as much as Excellent, Choice,
Beloved, as in <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 9. Ephraim <hi>is my First-born.</hi>
The Chiefest and most Eminent of Persons and
Things have this Name; thus <hi>the First-born of Death,
Iob</hi> 18. 13. is the most signal and mortal Disease,
or the cruellest kind of Death. The <hi>First-born of
the Poor,</hi> Isa. 14. 30. is the poorest of all. <hi>I will
make him my First-born,</hi> Psal. 89. 28. <hi>i. e.</hi> I will
make him a Great and Eminent Person, <hi>higher than
the Kings of the Earth,</hi> as it is explain'd in the
next words. Answerably to this sort of speaking,
Christ is said here to be <hi>the First-born of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
i. e. the Chief, the Prince, the Lord of all
Creatures. For we must know that this manner
of Expression refers to that Dignity and Pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
which were claim'd by the First-born under
the Law. Primogeniture carried with it the Right
of Superiority and Government. In allusion to
which, our Saviour is call'd the <hi>First-born</hi> (that is
the Lord) <hi>of every Creature:</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> may
better be rendred <hi>the whole Creation.</hi> He made, he
created all things; and therefore is Lord of the
whole Creation. Accordingly it immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<hi>For by him were all things created.</hi> This for
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46315:340"/>
gives us to understand, that this Verse is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and account of what went before: St. <hi>Paul</hi>
had stiled Christ <hi>the First-born of every Creature,</hi>
and now he gives this satisfactory account of it,
because by Him all things were created; because
of this he is deservedly stiled the <hi>First-born,</hi> the
Lord and Sovereign of the Creation. You must
either conclude that the Great St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not
speak Logically and Argumentatively, or that this
is the genuine Interpretation of the place. If the
Apostle's Words were to the purpose, (as be
sure they were) then this sense which I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
is so too, which is as much as I can desire:
And that this is the meaning of the word <hi>First-born,</hi>
is evident from that other Text in this Chapter,
<hi>ver.</hi> 18. where he is call'd the <hi>First-born from the
Dead,</hi> not (as some think) because he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Resurrection; or (as <hi>Grotius,</hi> with most
of the Pontificians) because he was the first that
rose to Immortal Life and Glory: or (as others)
because he was <hi>the First that rose from the Dead,</hi> as
'tis said <hi>Acts 26. 23. viz.</hi> by his own Power: but
because he was the Chiefest of all those that rose
from the Dead, because he was the Head of them
all, as it follows, <hi>that in all things he might have the
Preeminence,</hi> that it might appear that he was Lord
of all. This is <hi>to be the First-born of the Dead,</hi> or
<hi>of the Number of the Dead;</hi> for so it should be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
the Preposition <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifying here so much.
A third Text might be alledged, <hi>viz.</hi> Rom. 8. 29.
<hi>that he might be the First-born among many Brethren,
i. e.</hi> that he might be the Chief, the Supream of all
the Children of God; for he was <hi>Predestinated</hi> as
well as they, he was set a-part as the <hi>First-born</hi>
among Men (who were the <hi>Choicest</hi> of all) were,
who were more immediately destined and devoted

                        </gap>. 2. And lastly,
I will mention <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. where Christ is call'd <hi>the
First-begotten of the Dead,</hi> which hath the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
with those words in the Epistle to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians</hi>
before alledg'd, for it is explain'd to us by
what follows in the next Clause [<hi>and the Prince of
the Kings of the Earth:</hi>] to let us see that the word
<hi>First-born</hi> or <hi>First-begotten,</hi> hath the Signification
which I have offer'd, it being the use of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
to apply it to those Things or Persons that
are the <hi>Chiefest</hi> and <hi>most Excellent.</hi> In which sense
likewise <hi>First-fruits</hi> are taken in, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 18. where
the Saints are call'd <hi>the First-fruits of the Creatures
of God,</hi> i. e. they are the Chief of the Creation,
they are the Flower of Mankind, they are more
signally and eminently design'd to set forth the
Glory of God in the World. So Christ is <hi>the
First-fruits of them that slept,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 20. he is
the Principal of all those that rose from the Dead.
This way of Speaking is taken from the Jewish
notion of <hi>First-fruits,</hi> which were the Choicest of
all their Fruits and Incomes, and from the Hebrew
manner of expressing themselves, that is, calling
those things which are Chief and most Eligible
<hi>First-fruits,</hi> Amos 6. 1. Mic. 7. 1.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, I take that Expression which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
so often useth concerning himself, <hi>viz.</hi> his
stiling himself <hi>the Son of Man,</hi> to be a way of Speech
proper to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and therefore is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
by what we meet with in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                           <hi>Dr.</hi> S. Patrick <hi>(now a Reverend Bishop) in his</hi> Paraphrase <hi>on the</hi>

<hi>Paraphrast</hi> on this Sacred Book. Besides
several other Excellent Discoveries made by him
in that Choice Work, (which will gain him an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Honour among the Pious and Wise) he
hath particularly set us into a right apprehension
of This Expression so often used by the Holy Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
From several places in this Book (as also
from others which he produceth out of the Sacred
Writings) he evidenceth that <hi>Son of Man</hi> is the
same with an <hi>Eminent Person;</hi> and he is the first
Writer I have met with that hath establish'd and
<hi>fully</hi> clear'd this Notion. From this Discerning
Author we may observe, that in <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 2. there
is a difference made between <hi>bene adam</hi> and <hi>bene
ish,</hi> the former signifying there Mean Inferiour
Persons, but the latter Men of Considerable Rank
and Quality: wherefore our Translators give us
the sense very fully in rendring it <hi>low and high.</hi>
Or perhaps <hi>adam</hi> in this place is the same with <hi>ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah</hi>
Earth, and so <hi>the Sons of Man</hi> are opposed to
<hi>the Sons of the Earth,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>Psal. 4. 2. bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> for of such that place speaks.
And I translate it <hi>the Sons of Man,</hi> not <hi>of Men,</hi> (as
'tis in our English Bibles) for so the Original hath
it: and we ought to take notice of it, for there
is a vast difference between the one and the other.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46315:342"/>
                        <hi>Sons of Men</hi> in Scripture are all that are of the
Race of <hi>Adam,</hi> but <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Sons of Man,</hi> are Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of some Dignity and Rule in the World. But
sometimes indeed <hi>bene adam,</hi> is the same with
<hi>bene ish,</hi> and then they are opposed to <hi>enosh</hi> or
<hi>ben enosh,</hi> as in <hi>Psal. 8. 4. What is Man—and the
Son of Man?</hi> i. e. (as I conceive) what is the Lower
and the Higher Rank of <hi>Men, that Thou visitest them,</hi>
that Thou shewest thy self so Bountiful to them?
So <hi>Sons of Man,</hi> Psal. 58. 1. is meant of <hi>Iudges</hi>
and <hi>Great Men,</hi> as is evident from the former
words of that Verse. And in <hi>Psal. 80. 17. Son of
Man</hi> is the same with <hi>the Man of the right Hand,</hi>
and <hi>the Man that is made Strong.</hi> Again, in <hi>Psal.
146. 3. Princes</hi> and <hi>the Sons of Man</hi> are synonimous,
for [<hi>in Princes, in the Son of Man</hi>] are by way of
<hi>Apposition</hi> in the Hebrew, to acquaint us that they
are identified. And further it is to be observed,
that this Title of <hi>the Son of Man</hi> is particularly
and by way of Eminency affix'd to the <hi>Messias,</hi>
as in that foremention'd place, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. 4. (for we
shall find that in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 6. it is referr'd to him by
the Apostle in the Secondary and Mystical sense)
but more signally and directly in <hi>Dan. 7. 13. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
one like the Son of Man.</hi> On which words
<hi>Rabbi Saadiah</hi> is very peremptory, and saith, This
is the <hi>Messias our Righteousness.</hi> And <hi>Solomon Iar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,</hi>
and other great Rabbies declare, that by <hi>the
Son of Man is meant the Messias.</hi> There is reason
therefore to assert, that when <hi>Christ</hi> so frequently
gives himself this Title, he takes it from the Old
Testament, where it signifies a Man of Eminency
and Rule, and more especially from <hi>Daniel,</hi> who
by this Epithet expresses the <hi>Messias,</hi> the Prince,
the Lord of Heaven and Earth. And to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate
Man it is evident that our Saviour parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46315:342"/>
referr'd to that place in <hi>Daniel,</hi> [<hi>Behold,
one like the Son of Man came with the Clouds of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>]
when he pronounced those words, <hi>Hereafter
shall ye see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of
Power, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 26.
64. Neither would the High Priest have thought
that our Saviour spoke Blasphemy, and thereupon
rent his Clothes, if he had not apprehended that
he referr'd to those words of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
owned himself to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> who hath
the Title of the <hi>Son of Man</hi> given him because of
his Excellency, Preeminence, and Authority. And
this is yet more clear from our Saviour's words,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 27. where he assigns the Reason why the
Judgment of the World is committed to him by
the Father, <hi>He hath</hi> (saith he) <hi>given him Authority
to execute Iudgment, because he is the Son of Man,</hi>
because he is Head and Ruler of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all Government and Authority in this lower
World are devolv'd upon him, because he hath all
Rule and Dominion put into his Hands. This is
the true account, as I conceive, of the Expression;
this Title was attributed to him to signify his
<hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Exaltation,</hi> and not (as is commonly
said and believ'd, and as the Learned<note n="*" place="bottom">Annotat. in S. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 20.</note>

it) his <hi>Meanness, Condescension</hi> and <hi>Humility:</hi>
though I will not exclude Other Reasons which
may be consistent with this, as that he is call'd

to ascertain us of the Truth of his Suffering
in our Humane Nature, to assure us of his Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy

is rendred <hi>Glory,</hi> Gen. 31. 1. and the Tongue is
call'd <hi>cabod, Glory,</hi> Psal. 57. 8. So the Verb <hi>cabad</hi>
signifies both <hi>to be weighty,</hi> and <hi>to be glorious</hi> or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
<hi>Isa. 66. 5. Prov.</hi> 13. 18. And the Adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<hi>cabed</hi> approaches to this sense, as is clear
from <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 2. Thus it is with the word <hi>jakar,
gravis fuit:</hi> but it is understood in a treble sense,
as if there were a threefold Gravity, <hi>viz.</hi> of
Weight, Price and Honour. Accordingly it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies,

our word <hi>Baron,</hi> a Lord, a Person of Greatness and
Authority. And <hi>Grave</hi> answers to <hi>Baron,</hi> whence
<hi>Palsgrave, Landgrave, Margrave, Burgrave:</hi> for
<hi>Grave</hi> among the Germans signifies a Magistrate,
a Ruler. And we in <hi>England</hi> heretofore used the

                     <p>The Writers of the New Testament sometimes
make use of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in the same
sense that the Hebrews use the word <hi>gnanah, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondere;</hi>
that is, not to signify a Person's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering
or Replying to what another had said,
but only to denote his going on with his Speech,
his proceeding in what he had said before. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are said to <hi>Answer,</hi> though there be no Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
put to them, though there be no Reply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
as <hi>Iesus answer'd, and said,</hi> Mat. 11. 25.
<hi>Then answer'd</hi> Peter, <hi>and said,</hi> Mat. 17. 4. <hi>The
Angel answer'd, and said,</hi> Mat. 28. 5. <hi>One of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
answer'd, saying,</hi> Rev. 7. 13. which is (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

spake, and said;</hi> for this oftentimes is the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of that word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writings, and

Job <hi>answer'd, and said,</hi> though no body had spoke
to him, or asked him any Question. The words
therefore import no more than this, Job <hi>spake,
and said;</hi> and so our Translators render it. I
might further observe, that the Preposition <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in
the New Testament, hath by an <hi>Hebraism</hi> the
force of all the Prepositions, it answering to
the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Lastly, I am inclined to think that
what is said of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 15. is spoken
after the Hebrew manner: for the Hebrews call
any thing that is Choice and Delectable<note n="*" place="bottom">Nahum 2. 9.</note> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>vas desiderii;</hi> and the Rabbins accordingly call
the Law by this Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>viz. a Desirable Vessel,</hi> or
a Desirable Instrument or Utensil; for <hi>Cheli</hi> is of a
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46315:345"/>
vast Latitude, and signifies whatever is for the use
of Man. Answerably to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> is said to
be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>a chosen Vessel</hi> or <hi>Instrument.</hi> It
is spoken after the Propriety of the Hebrews, with
whom a Thing or Person that is made use of to some
Excellent Purpose, is not only stiled a <hi>Vessel,</hi> but,
to denote yet further the Worth of it, is called a
<hi>Vessel of Desire,</hi> which is of the like Signification
with a <hi>Vessel of Choice;</hi> for what is desired is chosen.
Thus in a few Instances I have shewed, that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Writers do Hebraize; and in many more I
might have done the same: For tho the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
hath not <hi>so many</hi> Hebraisms as is imagined
by some Criticks, yet it is not to be doubted that
Christ and his Apostles used them very frequently.
It is evident that a great part of the Phrases of the
New Testament are according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety;
yea, sometimes they agree more especially
with the <hi>Rabinical</hi> and <hi>Talmudick</hi> way of Writing,
as<note n="*" place="bottom">In Spicilegio.</note> 
                        <hi>Ludovicus Capellus,</hi> and others, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to demonstrate. Thus <hi>the Pillar and Ground

the Talmudick Doctors, (for their <gap reason="foreign">

empty Fellow. Christ follows the Language of the
Rabbins and Talmud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>sts when he uses the Word
<hi>Heaven</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 25. he ask'd the
Jews whether <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Baptism was <hi>from Heaven,</hi> i. e.
from God, <hi>or of Men. I have sinned against Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
i. e. God, saith the Prodigal Son to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Luke</hi> 15. 18. This was the Stile of the Eastern
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46315:346"/>
People, and of the Jews particularly, as you find
in <hi>Dan. 4. 23. 1 Macc.</hi> 3. 18. And this was the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Language of their <hi>Rabbins,</hi> they used <hi>Shamajim</hi>
instead of <hi>God.</hi> And in other Instances it might be
shewed, that the Sense of several Places in the New
Testament is manifested and illustrated by the
Knowledg of the <hi>Hebrew Phrase</hi> and <hi>Stile.</hi> For
which Reason it was necessary to say something of
this Matter, having undertaken to discourse of the
<hi>Stile of Scripture.</hi> We must remember that there
are frequent Hebraisms in these Greek Writings,
the Authors themselves being Hebrews, and they
likewise making use of the Stile of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and fetching thence several Expressions which
are purely Hebrew. Thus they must needs retain
the Hebrew Idiom and way of Speaking: and thus
the Old Testament and New agree the better; and
the former gives constant Light towards the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the latter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>6thly.</hi> Though there is a Great Variety of Words
and Phrases in the New Testament; and though
this Part of the Bible was not written in Attick,
but Hebrew Greek, yet this is to be asserted, that
there are no <hi>Soloecisms</hi> in it. I add this here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
some of old, and others of late, have unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
suggested the contrary, and have been so
hardy and presumptuous, as to aver that the Sacred
Scripture, especially the New Testament, abounds
with <hi>Soloecisms.</hi> This is particularly said<note n="*" place="bottom">Paulus, qui Soloecismos facit in loquendo. Hieronym. in Psal. 81.</note> of
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epistles</hi> by an Antient Father, whose Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness
it was to speak several things too daringly
and presumptuously: <q>That<note n="†" place="bottom">Coriarius Cilix. in Epist ad Ephes.</note> 
                           <hi>Cilician Currier,</hi>
saith he, (for so he calls St. <hi>Paul</hi>) that sorry
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46315:346"/>
Tradesman, was skill'd only in Hebrew, (which
was as it were his Mother-Tongue to him) and
therefore hath many Soloecisms and Barbarisms in
Greek.</q> And the same Author, in<note n="*" place="bottom">In Epist. ad Algasiam.</note> another
Place, speaks to the like purpose, and taxeth this
Apostle for want of Grammar and Syntax. Among
the Moderns you'l find <hi>Erasmus</hi> charging not only
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but the rest of the Apostles with this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in their Writings. There are many <hi>Soloecisms,</hi>

Hebraisms which are used by them. And those
worthy Reformers, <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> were not
afraid to talk after this rate. The former, after
his bold manner, imputes false Grammar to the
Evangelists and Apostles, as you may see in his

that<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">Institut. cap. 7. Sect. 12.</note> the Greek of the New Testament is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,

One of our <hi>own Annotators</hi> hath pick'd up this false

in the former Verse, it is easily answered
that the Apostle might express himself in the way

fancies <hi>Trajections</hi> in some Places where there are
none; yet, to the perpetual Honour of this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Gentleman it must be said, that he hath disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
several <hi>Trajections</hi> or <hi>Transpositions, Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Transitions, Ellipses,</hi> and Changes of <hi>Numbers</hi>
and <hi>Persons,</hi> with other <hi>Enallages,</hi> which were
scarcely taken notice of before: he hath rectified
some Comma's and Stops, he hath set the Words
and Periods right, he hath cleared the Syntax and
Grammatical Construction, mended the Sense in
several Places, removed the Difficulties, shew'd the
Propriety and Emphasis of the Words, discovered
the Coherence of the Texts: In short, he hath
cleared the New Testament of <hi>Soloecisms,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the Writings of the Great Apostle St.
<hi>Paul.</hi> So that though <hi>Tarsus,</hi> the Apostle's Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,
was in the same Province with and a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to <hi>Solae,</hi> the Country of those that corrupted
their Language, (whence came <hi>Soloecisms</hi>) yet it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that there is no such thing in the Apostle's
Stile.</p>
                     <p>But suppose these Texts above named could not
have been reconciled to the exact Laws of Grammar,
yet one would think the Transcribers might better
have been blamed than the Writers themselves:
the Greek Copy should have been found fault with
rather than the Holy Ghost: the Mistake might have
been imputed to the Amanuenses, and not to the
Apostles, I must profess to you plainly, that it is
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:46315:348"/>
bordering upon Blasphemy, to say that the Holy
Spirit, from whom was the Gift of Tongues, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
Barbarisms and Soloecisms in these Sacred
Writings, which were immediately inspired by
him. Again, suppose, or rather grant that some
Periods of the New Testament are not exactly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed
to Grammar-Rules, yet this will not justify the
Language of those Men who charge this Book with
Soloecisms and Barbarisms; for they will be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to grant that there are such things as these in
<hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and such approved Authors.
Or, if they will grant that there are such, then
they have no Reason at all to find fault with the
like in Holy Scripture. And this is that which I
maintain, and which no knowing Person can deny,
that the same things which some call Soloecisms and
Undue Syntax in the New Testament, are to be
found in the most Noted and Celebrated Authors
among the Greeks and Latins. Criticks have taken
notice of several of these in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Pindar</hi>
especially among the Greek Poets, and in <hi>Herodotus</hi>
and <hi>Thucydides</hi> among the best Historians that have
writ in that Language, and in <hi>Demosthenes</hi> among
the Noted Orators. These do not always observe
Grammatick Laws; they lay them aside sometimes,
and speak Irregularly, as<note n="*" place="bottom">Heinsius in Prolegom, in Exercitat. Sacr.</note> one of the Greatest

serious Men than the other) have taken notice of
this in Good Authors. Sometimes the Poet is at a
stand, and his Muse is restive: thus <hi>Virgil</hi> hath
Broken and Half-verses, which the Criticks excuse
by saying that he had not time to finish his Book,
or that he did it on purpose to stop his Readers in
the Career, that they might stay and consider the
thing he is speaking of. This Account they give
of his Blanks and Chasms. But <hi>Homer</hi> suffers not
his Muse to make a halt, but then (which is as bad)
he fills up his Verses with such Expletives as
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and besides these lesser Particles he
useth entire Words and Phrases in many Places only
to supply his Verse. We have nothing of this sort
in the Sacred Writings, nothing that is really su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.
But there are some Words indeed that
are look'd upon as Redundant, and not absolutely
Necessary, especially in the Old Testament, which
is Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tical in many places, <hi>The Lord rained Brimstone
and Fire from the Lord,</hi> Gen. 19. 24. where the last
Words [<hi>from the Lord</hi>] seem to be redundant. So
it is in 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 18. The Lord grant unto him that be
may find Mercy of the Lord in that Day.</hi> Thus in
Psal. 90. 10. <hi>The Days of our Years are threescore Years
and ten:</hi> We may look upon the first Word as an
Expletive, for the Divine Poet means this only,
that the ordinary Term of our Life extends to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Years: So that the word [<hi>Days</hi>] might have
been left out. The same Pleonasm you read in
2 <hi>Sam. 19. 34. How many Days are the Years of my
Life?</hi> for so it is according to the Hebrew: and it
is the <hi>Hebrew</hi> way of speaking, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be blamed. Yea, to speak strictly, there is
nothing redundant in the Stile of Scripture. All
those Words which seem to be Expletives, are Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46315:349"/>
and sometimes very Emphatical. The
<hi>Repetitions</hi> (which some think to be needless Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies)
are very useful as well as el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>gant. What
is more frequent in <hi>Homer,</hi> the Father of Poets?
There you meet with Verses and Half-verses over
and over again: and the Commentators on those
Places tell us, that his frequent using the same
Words is an Argument that his Stile is Natural and
Genuine, (as in common Discourse we are wont to
say the same things again and again) and that it
sheweth the Intenseness and Earnestness of the
Speaker, that it argues the Necessity of the Matter
as well as the Certainty of it, that it is to concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Attention, and that sometimes it is a great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
and Elegancy, besides that it was the Mode
of speaking then in use, and accordingly is to be
found in all Good Authors, more or less.</p>
                     <p>Why then should we not satisfy our selves after
the same manner, when we find the same things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in the <hi>Bible,</hi> especially in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and more particularly in the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi>
which far exceed <hi>Homer</hi> in Antiquity? That Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the Words in <hi>Gen. 1. 27. God created
Man in his own Image, in the Image of God created he
him,</hi> should not offend us: nor that in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Song
in <hi>Exod. 15. 16. Till thy People pass over, O Lord,
till thy People pass over:</hi> nor those many Reduplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Song of <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak, I will sing
unto the Lord, I will sing unto the Lord God of Israel,</hi>
Judg. 5. 3. <hi>The Mountains melted from before the Lord,
from before the Lord God of</hi> Israel, ver. 5. <hi>The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the Villages ceased, they ceased in</hi> Israel, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til

them away, that antient River, the River</hi> Kishon, <hi>v. 21.
At her Feet he bowed, he fell and lay down: at her Feet

and Reduplicating the Words, is so far
from being any Blemish to this Antient Song, that
it is to be accounted a great Elegancy, and a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Grace to it. This <hi>Anadiplosis</hi> is deemed a very
becoming Figure (and might have been mentioned
with those before) in the best Classical Writers:
and there is no Reason why it should not be so here.
If the repeating the same thing be in them a Sign of
the Naturalness of the Stile, and of the Seriousness
and Fervour of the Speakers, of the Weightiness of
the Subject, and the like, we cannot deny it to be
the same in these Antient Writings of the Bible.
It is observable, that as in the Sacred History of
this Book, so in <hi>Homer,</hi> the Messenger, whether he
be sent from God or Man, relates his Errand <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi>
in the same Words and Syllables usually that
it was delivered to him; so that he alters it not in
the least. In this, as in several other things, that
Antient Poet comes near to the Simplicity of the
Stile of Scripture. I could remark unto you also,
that that excellent Emperor <hi>Antoninus</hi> hath many
things in his Book which are conformable to the
Stile of the Holy Writ, and seem to resemble it:
His way of Writing is like an Emperor, Short, but
Pithy and Sententious. Many things are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd,
which must be supplied and understood.
He sometimes useth Words and Phrases as he
pleaseth, not as Other Writers are wont. He
hath unusual ways of expressing himself, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he <hi>coins Words</hi> (as it was his Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46315:350"/>
to do so with <hi>Money.</hi>) He hath several abrupt
and incoherent Periods; he is generally neglectful
and not studied. This is some Resemblance of the
Stile of Holy Scripture, where there is a Princely
Brevity, wherein more is contain'd than express'd:
where are (as I shall shew you anon) either New
Words, or those which are usual are applied in a New
and unheard of manner. The Stile seems in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Places to be inconsistent and independant, and
in most Places it is careless, and no ways elaborate.
But as no Wife Critick ever defamed the Emperor
for his particular Strain of Writing, so neither can
any Man of Judgment disparage the Penmen of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, whom he doth as 'twere imitate. In
brief, the Bible hath something in it of all manner
of Stiles, and partakes of the Excellencies of all
Authors: and where you see any Defect in the
strict Rules of Grammar, even there it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to Other Writers.</p>
                     <p>This may satisfy us, amidst the Cavils of some
Censurers of Scripture, that it hath in it the same
Phrases and Modes of Speaking, and manner of
using them, that are in the best Greek and Latin
Writings. Let us come then to the Reading of
Scripture, as we see Men do to <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil.</hi>
This is a fair Request, any Man will say, and it
must needs be granted. Now, you see, that if any
thing less Grammatical or Elegant occurs in those
Writers, the Course which is taken is this, Lexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons
and Dictionaries are consulted, the Masters of
Grammar and Rhetorick are advised with, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters
are search'd into, Other Authors are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with these, and their Business is to reconcile
them, and to make Sense of these Poets, and by all
means to make them speak well. And shall we not
do thus with the Sacred Writings? Shall we not
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46315:351"/>
indeavour by all those Ways to vindicate the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of them, and to justify the Propriety and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of their Stile, when we are able to do it by
Great Examples from the Best and most Celebrated
Writers among the Moral Philosophers, Orators,
Poets, Historians? The Worthy Knight before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentined
hath done his Part here very laudably;
he hath salv'd the Grammar of the New Testament
in many Places, and hath shewed that its Stile
(where it seems to be strange and uncouth) is paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
with very Good and Approved Authors. And
lastly, if any find fault with the Holy Writings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are immethodical, because neither the
Mosaick Law, nor other Parts of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor the Christian Doctrine in the New, are
reduced to Method and Artificial Order, the like
Answer may be given, <hi>viz.</hi> that this was not the
way of Other Writers in those Times. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that it was not the old way of the <hi>Iews;</hi> their
Books of Religion and Morals were not Orderly
disposed, but generally made up of Historical Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,
and Wise Aphorisms and Sentences. And
as for the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> most of their Learning was not
more accurate and reduced. You can descry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in their Writings of that Method and Order
which have since been observed. But my Business
here chiefly is not to consider whether the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be Methodized, but to defend the Propriety
of its Language. Or rather, it is not my Business
now, because I have sufficiently dispatch'd it, I
hope. I have let you see that those are no imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Judges of Scripture-Stile, who cry out of its
Barbarisms; but the Truth is, they betray both
their Ignorance and Irreligion at once, in giving
such a Judgment of it; their <hi>Ignorance,</hi> in that they
shew themselves unacquainted with the Best Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46315:351"/>
who are not always wont to bind themselves
to the strict Observation of Grammatical Rules.
To this purpose the Learned <hi>Henry Stephens</hi>'s <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversions</hi>
and <hi>Appendix</hi> at the End of his <hi>Thesau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
Gr. L.</hi> are worthy of the Perusal of all Curious
Persons that would be fully acquainted with the
Genius of the <hi>Attick</hi> Phrase and Idiom; and the
reading of these will abundantly satisfy them that
the New Testament is like other Greek Writers,
and that the most Classick Greek Authors speak in
the same strain that this doth. This Accomplish'd
Critick shews that there are pure <hi>Atticisms</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in these Holy Writings, and particularly
that an <hi>Ellipsis,</hi> which is so frequent in them, is a
common Atticism in the best Grecians. If those
who raise Objections against the Stile of the New
Testament would converse with These, they might
see that those Passages which seem not so proper or
elegant in Scripture, and that whatever looks like
Soloecisms, and favours of Rudeness or Defect of
Language in these Holy Writings, may be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled
with what they meet with in the most Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
Authors. Their <hi>Irreligion</hi> likewise is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in this, that nothing pleaseth them in the
Holy Book; and that what is not thought Improper
or Rude in other Writings, is accounted such in
These; yea, that what are Soloecisms in a Sacred
Writer, are look'd upon as Atticisms and Elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in a Profane One. Having hitherto been in
pursuance of this, that the Holy Scripture hath
many things in it according to the Strain of Other
Writers, I am to pass to the next <hi>Proposition.</hi>

                        <p>The Scripture-Stile hath some things in it that are not

was coin'd by the Evangelist: Its true Signification
enquired into. Inward Goodness or Righteousness
is express'd by Terms which are unknown to other
Writers. Instances of several other Peculiar ways
of Speaking. Some Profane Authors differ from
the rest as to the use of some particular Words and
Phrases. Ecclesiastical Writers have Words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to themselves. The Difficulty of Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
partly from the Different Acception of Words
which we meet with there. Many Instances in the Old
and New Testament. The various Significations of
the Word Spirit enumerated, and reduc'd to distinct
Heads. The Author confines himself to the Hebrew
Verbs of the Old Testament, and shews how Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
the Senses of the same words are, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to remove the Ambiguity of them in the several
Texts which he cites, and to determine the Sense
which is Proper to those particular Places. The like
he attempts in those Texts where Hebrew Nouns
of a different meaning occur.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE <hi>Third Proposition</hi> is, <hi>That the Scripture-Stile
hath some things in it that are not in
common with Other Writers, but are Proper
and Peculiar to it self.</hi> For though it is true some
Other Authors have words proper to themselves,
which are not found in others, (thus in <hi>Pindar,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46315:352"/>
Plato, Isocrates, Homer, Aristophanes, Hippocrates,</hi> &amp;c.
there are some particular Words and Phrases pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to them alone) yet the Bible hath Words
and Expressions which are not to be met with in
any of these, nor in any other Writers. The
Original <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath greater choice of Words than
any Book extant in that Language; it is the most
Copious Vocabulary that is in the World, and all
Hebrew Writers of note borrow from this. The

                     <p>And as the New Testament hath its peculiar

                     <p>Thus the Sacred Penmen of Scripture differ
from all others in their Stile. And yet herein
also they agree with them, for even some of those
Writers differ from the rest, as to the use of some
particular Words and Phrases. Some of them
take a word or more in a sense that it is not
taken in by any Others. There are words in
<hi>Homer</hi> that are not in <hi>Aristophanes;</hi> and some
in <hi>Lycophron,</hi> that are not in either of these;

Orators an Embellishment of Speech, certainly
we must account it no Disparagement, but rather
an Ornament to the Language, when the Holy
Ghost in the Scriptures <hi>alters the use</hi> of some Words.
He may make use of what Words he pleaseth:
He that bestow'd the Gift of Tongues, knows how
to apply them. Hence in these Writings you
meet with some New words and Singular ways
of Expression, as I have let you see in some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
and many more I might have added,
wherein the peculiar Phraseology of this Sacred
Book is observable. The very <hi>Words</hi> in the Holy
Stile are precious. Antiquaries and Criticks spend
much time in mere Phrases, but they never em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
it so well as when they are searching into
These. There are several Other things might be
noted as to the Peculiar Stile and Idiom of the
New Testament, but this shall suffice at present.
As I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>hew'd before that the Stile of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is like that of Other Writers, so you see it is
not inconsistent with what I have now asserted,
that the Holy Stile is not like that of Others;
that is, the Scripture hath Words and Phrases pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

and which are unusual with the rest of Authors.
But I will insist no longer on this here, because I

to suggest several things which will discover

things Obscure and Difficult in the Stile of Scripture.</hi>
I will give you an account of this in these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46315:355"/>
Particulars: 1. Obscurity and Difficulty
may arise from the Different Signification of the
same words in Scripture. 2. From the Contrariety
of the same words as to their Signification. 3. From
Other Causes relating to the <hi>Matter</hi> it self spoken
of, and the <hi>Time,</hi> &amp;c. Under which Heads I intend
to prosecute that Design which I formerly was
upon, <hi>viz.</hi> An <hi>Enquiry into several Remarkable Texts
of the Holy Scripture which contain some Difficulty in
them.</hi> I shall have occasion here to discover the
Grounds of that Difficulty, and to shew how it
may be removed. And when the Sentiments of
others are not satisfactory, I will make bold to
interpose my own Judgment.</p>
                     <p>First, Sometimes in Scripture there are <hi>Words of
Different Signification,</hi> whence it comes to pass, that
it is very hard to understand those places where
these words are. And it is impossible to satisfy
our selves about the meaning of them in the Texts
where we find them, unless we take pains to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the particular Congruity of one Sense rather
than another to that particular Thing or Person
to which it is applied. Yea, sometimes when we
meet with such a Doubtful Word, we shall find
it reasonable to make use of both the Senses of
it, that is, to propound them both, and to leave
it free to Persons to make choice of which they
please. I will give some Instances of this; as that
in <hi>Gen. 39. 1. Captain of the Guard,</hi> which may as
rightly be translated (according to <hi>Iosephus,</hi> Antiq.
l. 2. c. 3.) <hi>Chief of the Cooks,</hi> for the LXX render
it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and the Hebrew <hi>Tabbach</hi> (the
Plural whereof is here used) is a <hi>Cook,</hi> 1 Sam. 8.
13. Ch. 9. 23, 24. and is so translated. The truth
is, the genuine rendring of <hi>Tabbach</hi> is <hi>Mactator,</hi>
a Slayer, and so is applicable either to a <hi>Cook</hi> or a
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:46315:356"/>
                        <hi>Soldier.</hi> The double sense of the Word occasions
some doubt about the Translation, but it is of no
moment at all: for we are not to be concern'd
whether <hi>Potiphar</hi> was <hi>Pharao<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>'s <hi>Head-Cook</hi> (which
without doubt was an Honourable Place) or <hi>the
Captain of his Guard,</hi> or <hi>Army</hi> (as the Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
gives it.) So in <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 43. [<hi>they cried before
him</hi> Abrek] the word <hi>Abrek</hi> may be differently
rendred, <hi>viz.</hi> either according to <hi>Aben-Ezra,
Aquila,</hi> the Vulgar Latin, and our own English
Translation [<hi>bow the Knee</hi>] deriving it from <hi>barak,
genu flexit:</hi> or according to <hi>Solomon Iarchi,</hi> and
the Paraphrases of <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Ionathan [Father of
the King</hi>] (for <hi>Rek</hi> in the Aramaean Tongue is <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ex,</hi>
and thence perhaps this Latin word:) or according
to the <hi>Ierusalem Targum</hi> [Father of the King, and
tender in Years], or according to <hi>Symmachus,</hi>
[tender Father] (from <hi>Ab Pater,</hi> and <hi>Rech tener
sen delicatue,</hi>) because <hi>Ioseph</hi> was as to his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
a Father, as to his Age a Tender Youth.
Thus this word being of a dubious Signification,
according to the different Etymologies it hath,
may be diversly translated, and every one is at
liberty to choose which of these Senses he most
approv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s of. I cannot see how the Doubtfulness
of such words as this can be wholly taken away,
and consequently the Scripture as to such words,
must remain Dubious and Obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ure, that is, as to
the particular and close import of them. But 'tis
sufficient that we have the general sense of them,
as here, though we are ignorant of the right and
only Derivation of the word <hi>Abr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>h</hi> (and after all
the foremention'd Surmises, it is most probable
(as hath been said before) that 'tis an Egyptian
word) yet this we are certain of, that it was a
word of Acclamation and Honour that the People
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:46315:356"/>
used toward <hi>Ioseph:</hi> and 'tis not requisite to know
any more in order to the understanding of the
Place.</p>
                     <p>It is thus in the New Testament; it is said of
<hi>Iudas</hi> that <hi>he went and hanged himself,</hi> Mat. 27. 5.
So we translate it indeed, and very well, but the
Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is of a more general import,
signifying that he was <hi>strangl'd</hi> or <hi>choak'd,</hi> which
may be done either by a String (which is properly
<hi>Hanging</hi>) or by Excessive <hi>Grief,</hi> which stifled his
Spirits: and accordingly we may render the Word
either of these ways, <hi>viz.</hi> Actively, [<hi>he hanged
himself</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> he ended his Life with a Halter, or
Passively, [he was Choaked] namely, by a sudden
stopping of his Breath, and Suffocation of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
through Melancholy and Grief. Either of
these Senses may be admitted, yea both of them,
as I have shew'd in another place. Wherefore
the best rendring of the words is, I conceive, this,
Judas <hi>strangled himself,</hi> or <hi>was strangled,</hi> because
this takes in both. It is said of the Pharisees,
<hi>Mark 7. 3. Except they wash their Hands oft, they eat
not:</hi> where the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which is translated
[<hi>oft</hi>] hath different Significations, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may be rendred diversly. First, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<hi>the Fist</hi> or <hi>Hand closed,</hi> and so here is meant
their way of Washing their Hands by thrusting
the Fist into the Palm of the Hand. Secondly,
The Greek word signifies also the <hi>Elbow,</hi> and then
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is as much as <hi>up to the Elbow,</hi> and denotes
another particualar way of Washing among the
Conceited Pharisees, by letting the Water drop
from their Hands (being held up) to the very El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows.
Thirdly, The word may be rendred [<hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,</hi>]
or according to the Syriack [<hi>accurately,</hi>]
and so signifies to us that great Care and Exactness
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:46315:357"/>
they used in their Ceremonious Washings. Lastly,
Our Translators, according to another acception
of the word, and following the Vulgar Latin, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it <hi>oft.</hi> Any of these four ways the word may
be taken: and the Dubiousness of it should not in
the least trouble us, because we understand the
grand thing contain'd in the words, <hi>viz.</hi> That the
Jews, but especially the Pharisees, were very super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiously
addicted to their <hi>Washings,</hi> and placed
the greatest part of their Religion in that and
the like External Observances. I could instance
in 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19. The Foundation of God standeth
sure, having this Seal,</hi> &amp;c. which Text may admit
of this Translation also, <hi>The Covenant of God stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
sure, having this Inscription;</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
not only a <hi>Foundation,</hi> but a <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of Contract:</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifies an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi>
as well as a <hi>Seal.</hi> There were two Parts
of the Covenant, <hi>I will be your God,</hi> and <hi>ye shall be
my People:</hi> So here in the following words, <hi>The
Lord knoweth them that are his:</hi> And, <hi>Let every one
that nameth the Name of Christ depart from Iniquity.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Next, I will mention that of the Apostle, <hi>Heb.

meaning is, that not only the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>heavy</hi> Sins

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:46315:357"/>
is another Signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>

                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> is applied when
there are no <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, no favourable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,

                        </gap> then signifies that
which hath Goodly Circumstances and Arguments
to recommend it. Such have some Sins especially,
as those that are accompanied with much Profit
or Pleasure; against these therefore the Apostle
exhorts us here to arm our selves: he would
have us in a more especial manner to beware of
those Vices which are so Tempting. There is
yet another rendring of the words according to
<note n="†" place="bottom">In Locum.</note> 
                        <hi>Theophylact;</hi> for he observes, that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is
<hi>Periculum, Discrimen:</hi> and indeed the Stoicks gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
use the word in this sense. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Hesychius,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: it
signifies Affliction, Necessity, Trouble. And the
Fathers sometimes use it thus in their Writings.
So that the Apostle adviseth us here to shun those
Sins especially which bring us into great Dangers
and Difficulties, those that are accompanied even
with bodily Calamities and Judgments, as some
kinds of Sins generally are. Those Vices that are
thus <hi>circumstantiated,</hi> are to be avoided with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Caution. But, I confess, I do not think this
to be the meaning here, for the Adverb <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> join'd
with <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, rather shews that the <hi>Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
are <hi>good.</hi> And of the other three Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
I look upon the first to be the best, because
it is according to the clearest and most obvious
sense of the Greek word; and withal it agrees
with the Mind of the Apostle in the whole Verse,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:46315:358"/>
where taking his Metaphor from the Olympick
Races, he exhorts the Jewish Converts to <hi>run with
Patience the Race that was set before them,</hi> and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to that <hi>to lay aside every Weight</hi> or Incumbrance,
as the Racers were wont to do, and <hi>the Sin which
did so easily beset them,</hi> compass them about, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and retard them in their Christian Course, as
Long or Heavy Garments are an hindrance to those
that run; for any observing Eye may see that he
continues the Metaphor. Thus you see words have
<hi>Different Senses,</hi> and so may be translated diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently;
and hence the true Meaning is difficultly
to be reach'd sometimes.</p>
                     <p>I will mention one Instance more, which is to
be found both in the Old and New Testament.
There we often read of <hi>the Spirit:</hi> no word is
more usual with the Sacred Writers than this,
and it is as true that no word hath more Various
Significations; whence sometimes doth arise no
small Difficulty in interpreting some of those places
where this word occurreth. Suffer me then to
give a full and ample Account of the Different
Significations of it, that it may not administer
occasion of Obscurity in the Stile of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>First, The word <hi>Spirit</hi> is applied to <hi>God,</hi> and
particularly to the Third Person in the Undivided
Trinity, who is Emphatically call'd <hi>the Spirit</hi> in
the Old Testament, as in <hi>Gen. 1. 2. Gen.</hi> 6. 3. and
in almost iunumerable other places; and <hi>the Holy
Spirit</hi> or <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> by way of Eminency in the
New Testament, <hi>Mat. 3. 16. Iohn 1. 32. Rom.</hi> 8.
14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, It signifies the <hi>Gifts, Graces, Fruits,
Effects,</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> as 1. Any
Signal Qualities or Endowments whatsoever, any
Skill or Ability to do things well and laudably.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46315:358"/>
Thus <hi>Bezaliel</hi> was <hi>filled with the Spirit of God,</hi> (Exod.
31. 3, 5.) <hi>to work in all manner of Workmanship.</hi>
And Gifts of any sort are call'd <hi>the Spirit</hi> in other
places. 2. The <hi>Saving Graces</hi> of the Holy Spirit,
as in <hi>Iude,</hi> ver. 19. <hi>having not the Spirit,</hi> and in
several other places. 3. The <hi>Power of the Spirit</hi>
to accomplish some very great and extraordinary
thing: thus <hi>Caleb had another Spirit,</hi> Num. 14. 24.
<hi>i. e.</hi> he had Power to effect those things which
he could not do before. <hi>Ioshuah was a Man in
whom was the Spirit,</hi> Num. 27. 18. Thus the <hi>Spirit
of God</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of the Lord</hi> are said in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to <hi>come upon,</hi> to <hi>fall upon,</hi> to be <hi>poured out,</hi> to
be <hi>put upon</hi> Persons; that is, they had an unusual
and extraordinary Power to do this or that. To
be <hi>moved,</hi> and to be <hi>led by the Spirit</hi> are in the
same Signification, <hi>viz.</hi> to be enabled to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
and atchieve some Wonderful Thing.
4. Those Extraordinary and Miraculous Gifts
which were conferr'd on the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>other
Christians</hi> in the Infancy of the Gospel, as Healing
all manner of Diseases, Speaking strange Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.
These are express'd by this Word in
1 Cor. 14. 12. <hi>Ye are zealous of Spirits,</hi> i. e. Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Gifts, the Extraordinary Vouchsafements of
the Spirit, whereby they were able to do things
above Humane Power: Hence you read of <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Spirit, Praying with the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Singing
with the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 14, 15. And in the
same Chapter there is mention of <hi>the Spirits of
the Prophets,</hi> ver. 32. <hi>i. e.</hi> the Gifts of Prophecy
which they were indued with, and enabled to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert
in the Publick Congregation. Before Christ's
Ascension these Gifts were not bestow'd in a very
large and liberal manner, and that is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Iohn 7. 39. the Holy Ghost was not yet given.</hi>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:46315:359"/>
And even after our Saviour's Ascension, the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian
Christians <hi>had not heard whether there was any
Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts 19. 2. that is, they knew nothing
of these Extraordinary Gifts bestow'd on some in
the Church. Wherefore we read there that by
the Imposition of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hands <hi>the Holy Ghost
came upon them, and they spake with Tongues and
prophesied,</hi> ver. 6. This latter Clause explains the
former, letting us see that by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> is
here meant the Miraculous Endowments of the
Spirit, such as speaking with strange Tongues, and
Prophesying in an unusual manner. Of these chiefly
the Apostle is to be understood in 1 <hi>Thess. 5. 19.
Quench not the Spirit.</hi> 5. Extraordinary <hi>Revelations</hi>
and <hi>Discoveries</hi> (whether under the Old or New
Testament) are express'd by this Word. Thus
'tis said, <hi>there is a Spirit in Man,</hi> Job 32. 8. which
is explain'd in the next Clause by <hi>the Inspiration of
the Almighty. So</hi> David <hi>in Spirit,</hi> Mat. 22. 43. is
<hi>David</hi> Inspired. <hi>I will pour out of my Spirit upon all
Flesh,</hi> Acts 2. 17. (taken from <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 28.) <hi>i. e.</hi> I will
bestow the Gift of Prophecy and Revealing of
Mysteries upon them, for of This it is principally
understood, as you may learn from the following
words, <hi>Your Sons and your Daughters shall prophesy;</hi>
and ver. 18. <hi>On my Servants and on my Hand-maids
I will pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</hi>
So in <hi>Rev. 1. 10. I was in the Spirit,</hi> is as much as if
he had said, I had great Revelations imparted to
me.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Dispensation and Preaching of the
Gospel,</hi> especially as it is opposed to the <hi>Law,</hi> and
as it contains the more hidden Mysteries of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
in it, is stiled <hi>the Spirit.</hi> Thus the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Preachers are call'd <hi>Ministers not of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3, 6. <hi>i. e.</hi> not of the Law, but
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46315:359"/>
of the Gospel, not of mere Externals of Religion,
but of the Inward and Hidden Secrets of it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The <hi>Spiritual meaning</hi> of what Christ
speaketh is call'd by this Name, as in <hi>Iohn 6. 63.
It is the Spirit that quickneth, the Flesh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
the Words that I speak unto you they are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and they are Life.</hi> As if he had said, you must
not understand me in a gross and carnal sense,
when I tell you that you must <hi>eat my Flesh and
drink my Blood,</hi> ver. 53, 54. My meaning is not
that you should turn Canibals, and feed upon Man's
Flesh. No: this Eating and Drinking which I have
spoken of to you, are to be interpreted in a Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual
Sense, and in no other. My Words have an
Abstruse and Mystical meaning, I am Spiritually
to be Eaten and Drunk, that is, by a Lively Faith
only. <hi>It is the Spirit that quickeneth,</hi> that enliveneth:
that which is comprehended in the Spiritual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of my Words, is the thing that is most Active
and Powerful in Religion, and in the Lives of
Men.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, By <hi>Spirit</hi> is meant the Person that is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
1 <hi>Iohn 4. 2. Every Spirit that confesseth that
Iesus is come in the Flesh, is of God.</hi> Nay,</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, He that pretends to the Spirit, but really
is not inspired by the Holy Ghost, is thus called: as
in the next Verse, <hi>Every Spirit that confesseth not
that Iesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is not of God:</hi>
and in the first Verse of that Chapter, <hi>Believe not
every Spirit; but try the Spirits,</hi> i. e. Teachers that
pretend to the Spirit and Inspiration, who are call'd
<hi>False Prophets</hi> in the same place, and <hi>Seducing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
1 Tim. 4. 1. Therefore <hi>discerning of Spirits,</hi>
1 Cor. 12. 10. was that Gift in the Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they knew who were truly Inspired, and who
not; who were True, and who False Prophets.
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46315:360"/>
And as the Persons pretending to immediate Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
from the Spirit are thus stiled, so the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eigned Discoveries or Revelations themselves,
which they boast of, are called <hi>Spirit,</hi> 2 Thess. 2. 2.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, The word <hi>Spirit</hi> in Scripture is meant
of the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man, and its different Functions,
Operations, Dispositions, Inclinations; and in
short, the whole Frame and State of it. 1. I say
that Distinct Part of Man which is call'd his <hi>Soul,</hi>
hath the Denomination of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that very
justly, because it is a Spiritual or Immaterial Being.
<hi>Into thy Hands I commit my Spirit,</hi> saith the Psalmist,
<hi>Psal. 31. 5. i. e.</hi> I trust thee with my Soul. It is
call'd <hi>the Spirit of a Man,</hi> Prov. 18. 14. <hi>ch. 20. 27.
Eccles.</hi> 3. 21. This is <hi>the Spirit that shall return to
God,</hi> Eccles. 12. 7. Wherefore this was the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of our dying Saviour, <hi>Into thy Hands I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
my Spirit,</hi> Luke 23. 46. and of that expiring
Martyr, <hi>Acts 7. 59. Lord Iesus, receive my Spirit.</hi>
The Souls of the Saints are stiled <hi>the Spirits of just
Men made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12. 23. and those of the
Wicked, <hi>the Spirits in Prison,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 19. And
hither is to be referr'd that of St. <hi>Iames,</hi> ch. 2. 26.
<hi>the Body without the Spirit (i. e.</hi> without the Soul) <hi>is
dead.</hi> 2. The <hi>Vital Principle,</hi> which is the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Operation of the Soul, is termed <hi>the Spirit,
the Spirit of Life,</hi> Gen. 7. 22. especially the more
Active and Vigorous Operation of the Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is so called, <hi>Iosh. 5. 1. Nor was there Spirit in
them.</hi> Whence you read of the <hi>reviving</hi> and <hi>coming
again</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> Gen. 45. 27. Judg. 15. 19. and

Numb.</hi> 14. 24. may be understood in this Sense as
well as in that above-mention'd. In the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
our Saviour pronounceth those <hi>Blessed</hi> that

signifies either the <hi>Will,</hi> or the <hi>Hearty Affections</hi> of
the Soul, or both of them. 6. In a more general
way it signifies the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of a Man: <hi>Ye
know not of what Spirit ye are,</hi> Luke 9. 55. And this
Large and General Acception of the Word is very
usual in the Holy Stile. 7. More particularly and

and Regenerate Part of Man is emphatically
stiled <hi>the Spirit,</hi> and is opposed to the <hi>Flesh,</hi> which
is the Sensual and Unregenerate Part of Man. <hi>The
Spirit is willing, but the Flesh is weak,</hi> Matth. 26. 41.
<hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit,</hi> John 3. 6.
<hi>The Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Flesh,</hi> Gal. 5. 7. This is the frequent
Acception of the Word in the New Testament.
Yea, 9. Not only the Holy and Godly Nature, the
Renewed Disposition and Temper, but even that
which is Unholy and Ungodly, the Old and Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
Principle of Man, is also known by this
Name. <hi>The Spirit,</hi> saith St. <hi>Iames, that dwelleth in
us lusteth to Envy,</hi> ch. 4. 5. where by <hi>Spirit</hi> is meant
the Sensual and Carnal Part of Man. And so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we took notice of the <hi>Spirit of Slumber, of Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi>
and the like. Thus much of the word <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
as it hath reference to the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man and its
Faculties. Only I will add this, that this Word
applied either to the good or evil Operations of
the Mind, signifies to us the Reality and Efficacy of
them, and represents their great Vehemency; for
they proceed from <hi>the Spirit</hi> of Man, which is vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and active. Though this Word likewise may
refer to the Original and Source of these Actions,
for there is in Men a Double Spirit, a Good and an
Evil one, <hi>the Spirit of the World, and the Spirit which
is of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 12. Hence in the Stile of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:46315:361"/>
good and evil Actions are frequently attributed
to some <hi>Spirit;</hi> for they are Results either of the
Good or Evil one that inhabits in them.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, <hi>Angels,</hi> both good and bad, are signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by this Word: First, the Good ones, <hi>Heb. 1. 7.
He maketh his Angels Spirits,</hi> which is taken from
Psal. 104. 4. <hi>Are they not all ministring Spirits?</hi> Heb.
1. 14. Secondly, the Evil ones, who in the Old
Testament are call'd <hi>Evil Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Lying Spirits;</hi>
and in the New Testament, <hi>Vnclean, Foul, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Spirits, Spirits of Divination. Rejoice not,</hi> saith
our Saviour, <hi>that the Spirits (i. e.</hi> the Devils, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from <hi>ver. 17.) are subject unto you,</hi> Luke 10.
20. <hi>The Spirit that worketh in the Children of Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
Eph. 2. 2. is no other than Satan. I questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not but that the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in <hi>Eph.</hi>
6. 12. are no other than <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Wickedness,</hi> which are said to be in <hi>high</hi> or
<hi>Heavenly Places,</hi> because these Wicked Spirits are
so hardy as to encounter often with the Good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels;
they labour to wrest the Souls of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
out of their Hands, whilst they are conducting
them through the Ethereal Regions, to the Mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Glory in the highest Heavens. And if they
have the Confidence to grapple with those Blessed
Spirits, certainly they will not fail to assault Us
weak and sinful Creatures: <hi>Wherefore</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
adjoins in this Place) <hi>we must take unto us the
whole Armour of God,</hi> that we may be able to <hi>wrestle
against these spiritual Wickednesses,</hi> or rather <hi>wicked
Spirits.</hi> So in <hi>Rev. 16. 14. Spirits of Devils</hi> are as
much as Devilish Spirits, or Evil Angels.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, The same Word is used to express an
<hi>Apparition</hi> or Seeming Shape of a Body without real
Corporeity, as in <hi>Luke 24. 37. They supposed they had
seen a Spirit.</hi> They had a Notion of a Spirit's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46315:362"/>
though as a Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it it was impossible to be
seen of it self, for being void of Matter and Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
it could not be the Object of the Bodily
Senses: which true Account of a Real Spirit our
Saviour gives them in these Words, <hi>A Spirit hath
not Flesh and Bones,</hi> ver. 39. <hi>i. e.</hi> it hath nothing
Corporeal belonging to its Nature and Essence.</p>
                     <p>Which brings me to the next, the Tenth Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Word; and that is this, it signifies a
Spiritual Immaterial Substance, wholly devoid of
all Matter. John 4. 24. <hi>God is a Spirit, i. e.</hi> he is a
Substance in which there is nothing of Body or
Quantity; he is an Intelligent and Thinking Being:
which high Privilege and Excellency no Material
thing is capable of.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, <hi>A Breath, a Wind, a Blast,</hi> are synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
with <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Holy Stile, as in <hi>Eccles. 11.
5. Thou knowest not what is the way of the Spirit,</hi> i. e.
of the <hi>Wind,</hi> as is evident from the former Verse,
where the word <hi>Ruach</hi> is so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>endred. And in <hi>Ezek.
37. 9. the four Spirits</hi> or <hi>Winds</hi> are the same: and
so the word is used twice more in that Verse. Thus
'tis in the New Testament, in <hi>Iohn 3. 8. The Wind
bloweth where it listeth:</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which is
generally translated <hi>Spirit</hi> in the New Testament,
is here translated <hi>Wind,</hi> and that very rightly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Interpretation of several of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Fathers: Particularly the <hi>Air,</hi> the <hi>Wind</hi> or
<hi>Breath,</hi> which is drawn in and sent forth by the
Lungs, hath this Denomination: Thus in <hi>Iob 34.
14. Spirit</hi> and <hi>Breath</hi> are the same. And those
Words in <hi>Iohn 19. 30. He gave up the Ghost,</hi> or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
are expressed thus in another Evangelist, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<hi>he expired, he yielded up his Breath,</hi> Luke
23. 46. To this refers 2. <hi>Thess. 2. 8. Whom the

Languages for <hi>Spirit</hi> signify <hi>Wind</hi> or <hi>Breath,</hi> and
that in the first and original Sense of them. This
alone is the Proper Signification of the Word: but
as for all the other Acceptions of it before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
they are secondary and improrper. The
word <hi>Spirit</hi> is improperly applied to the Person, and
to the Gifts or Graces of the Holy Ghost: it is
improperly attributed to the Souls of Men and their
Faculties, and Operations: it is improperly spoken
of Angels or Devils, or of any of those other things
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fore-named, except the last. But these are the
Different Acceptions of the Word in the Sacred
Writings, according to that Observation which I
have made of it at several times; and perhaps there
are some Other Denotations of this Word, which
I have not taken notice of. I instanced in This
(whereas I might have instanced in many more) to
let you see how Large and Extensive the Meaning
of some Words in Scripture is, and thereby to
give you some Account of the <hi>Difficulty</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity</hi>
of the Holy <hi>Stile</hi> in some Places, which yet
you see we may render very intelligible and plain
by a diligent Enquiry into, and Comparing those
Places where these dubious Words occur.</p>
                     <p>But still to give you a farther Account of the
<hi>Different Acceptions</hi> of Terms, I could sufficiently
prosecute this, tho I confin'd my self to the Hebrew
Words of the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> It would most fully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
that the same words in this Holy Volume signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
Different things. I shall only propound the several
Particulars, and leave them to be distinctly applied
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46315:363"/>
upon occasion, by those that have leisure to do it.
It is well known that <hi>Vau</hi> is a <hi>Conjunction Copulative,</hi>
but it is of other Use in several Places, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is common to it in part with the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in
the Septuagint Version, and in the New Testament.
Sometimes it is <hi>Conversive,</hi> (as they call it) it
changes the Tense: and sometimes it is <hi>Interrroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi>
At other times it is <hi>Adversative,</hi> and is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
to <hi>but</hi> or <hi>although:</hi> Not unusually it hath the
Force of an <hi>Adverb</hi> of Time, and is as much as
<hi>when, then, now.</hi> It is also a <hi>Comparative</hi> Particle,
and is the same with <hi>so.</hi> Oftentimes it is put for
the Relative Pronoun <hi>asher, which.</hi> Sometimes it
is <hi>Emphatical,</hi> (as the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is) and is of the like
Signification with <hi>even</hi> in English. Again, it <hi>seems</hi>
to be Redundant, as when it begins a Chapter or
some New Matter, without reference to any thing
before. Thus not only some of the Books of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
but those of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Ionah,</hi> begin with a <hi>Vau.</hi>
But it is certain that this Particle is not merely Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletive
<hi>here,</hi> as the Learned Jews acknowledg.
Lastly, Many times in the Hebrew Stile it is not
Copulative, but Disjunctive, and it is accordingly
rendred <hi>or</hi> and <hi>nor,</hi> by our Translators, as in <hi>Gen. 26.
11. He that toucheth this Man or his Wife:</hi> and in
Exod. 21. 15. <hi>He that smiteth his Father or his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
and in <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 10. and in several other Places
of Scripture the Hebrews acknowledge that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive
Particle is a Disjunctive; as the Aspect of
<hi>Conjunction</hi> in the Sun is sometimes among Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
call'd <hi>Opposition.</hi> Thus this <hi>Vau</hi> is of great
Latitude, which causes Variety of rendring many
Places: but those that are very Observing and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
(as it was intended by Providence that we
should be in reading the Bible) will soon know how
to make a Difference, and to discern the proper
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46315:363"/>
meaning of this Particle. Likewise the Hebrew
<hi>Pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>positions</hi> are of various Signification, and one is
put for another very often, which makes the Sense
not a little difficult. Who sees not that these
<hi>Praefixes</hi> or <hi>Praepositions</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
used, and at one time are applied one way,
and another another? And who knows not that
sometimes they seem to be unnecessary, and to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
nothing at all? though even then without
doubt they are of some Significancy and Use.
But to know this aright is not easy: a great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Tongue is requisite to discover it.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Hebrew Verbs</hi> also are very Equivocal, and
have very Different meanings. In their divers
<hi>Conjugations,</hi> they have divers Significations, whence
it proves a very hard thing sometimes to know
which of them is meant. A word in <hi>Kal</hi> may bear
one sense, in <hi>Piel</hi> another, in <hi>Hiphil</hi> a Third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
But if we apply our selves with that Care and
Industry to the searching into the Scriptures which
are required of us, we shall either be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
which Particular Sense is meant in the places
before us; or where we cannot attain to this, we
shall find that our Ignorance is not prejudicial to
us, because the Controversy is not about any thing
which we ought necessarily to know. The Verb
<hi>Chalal</hi> signifies <hi>to begin</hi> and <hi>to profane,</hi> according to
its different Conjugations. Of the former Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
there are Instances in <hi>Gen. 6. 1. Num.</hi> 17.
11. and many other places; Of the latter in <hi>Num
30. 3. Ezek.</hi> 39. 7. and abundance of other Texts:
whence there is some dispute about <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 26.
some rendring the word <hi>Huchal Men began,</hi> others
<hi>Men profaned.</hi> Both the Chaldee Paraphrasts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it in the latter sense, and so do the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Rabins generally. They take the meaning of

Crime,</hi> it would certainly have been mention'd,
and that plainly: as you see afterwards, that as
soon as this Horrid Sin began to be practis'd in

themselves to be the People of God, and
Worshippers of the Most High. Thus <hi>to call on
the Name of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>to be call'd by his Name,</hi>
amount to the same, and signify that at that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
time the Faithful invoked God, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd
and serv'd him in a more solemn manner
than before: and they publickly own'd themselves
to be <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> and the Servants of the Great
<hi>Iehovah.</hi> Thus <hi>Men began to call on God's Name,</hi>
and thus <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> and other Modern Rabbies (who
have better consider'd of it) understand this Text
in the plain Sense of it. And it is likely it had
never been otherwise understood, if the ambiguity
of the Verb <hi>Chalal</hi> had not given occasion; for
this in the Conjugation <hi>Niphal,</hi> signifies <hi>to profane,</hi>
and <hi>to be profaned,</hi> but in <hi>Hiphil</hi> and <hi>Hophal</hi> (as
here) <hi>to begin:</hi> which some took no notice of, and
so mistook the Sense.</p>
                     <p>To proceed, the Hebrew word <hi>Pathah</hi> signifies
to <hi>enlarge</hi> and <hi>perswade,</hi> whence there is some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the Translation of <hi>Gen. 9. 27. God shall
enlarge;</hi> others read it, <hi>God shall perswade</hi> Japheth.
But yet if you take either of the Readings with the
following Words, the Sense is not varied, the
meaning is the same; for the whole Verse contains
God's Promise, that <hi>Iapheth should dwell in the Tents
of Shem;</hi> that is, that the Gentiles, who sprang
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:46315:365"/>
from <hi>Iapheth,</hi> should be converted to Judaism, and
that both they and the Jews, who came from
<hi>Shem,</hi> should embrace Christianity; and this <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging</hi>
of <hi>Iapheth</hi>'s Borders should be done by <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,</hi>
by the mild and gentle Methods of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
by the <hi>Perswasive</hi> Power of the Gospel preach'd
to them. Thus I decide the quarrel among Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians
and Criticks about the Hebrew word, by
joining both the Senses of it together. And this
we shall find to be a good Expedient some other
times. The Hebrew word <hi>Chush</hi> signifies <hi>to make
haste,</hi> and <hi>to be ashamed,</hi> saith our Learned<note n="*" place="bottom">Not. Miscell. in Port. Mos.</note> 
                        <hi>Pocock;</hi>
and thence that place in <hi>Isa. 28. 16. he that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
shall not make haste,</hi> is otherwise worded in
Rom. 9. 33. <hi>he that believeth on him shall not be
ashamed.</hi> If there be this Different acception of
the Verb, it is impossible without a Revelation
(which we have no reason to expect) to tell which
Sense is peculiarly designed by the Prophet, for
we have no Light at all from the Context to help
us. But seeing the Word is capable in this place
of both Significations, let us (as before) unite
them together: for it is certain, that <hi>he who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
will neither make haste, nor be ashamed.</hi> Kaphatz
is <hi>claudere,</hi> and also <hi>transilire,</hi> viz. <hi>è loco suo:</hi> whence
you may read the word in <hi>Iob</hi> 24. 24. either thus,
<hi>they are shut up,</hi> viz. in Destruction, or in the Grave;
or, <hi>they are taken out of the way.</hi> The Subject Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will permit both Translations. The Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Rad</hi> is both <hi>dominari</hi> and <hi>plangere, plorare:</hi>
whence there may be a double Interpretation of
that place. <hi>Gen. 27. 40. when thou shalt have the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi>
or <hi>when thou shalt have Mourned:</hi> and both
Sentences are applicable. <hi>Sacal</hi> is <hi>intelligere, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperum,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46315:365"/>
felicem esse:</hi> therefore it is hard to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
whether the word in <hi>Ios. 1. 7, 8. Isa. 52. 13.
Ier.</hi> 23. 5. be to be rendred in the first or the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Sense. But neither in this nor the foregoing
Text is any Point of Faith concern'd. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the word <hi>Shanah</hi> is not only <hi>mutare</hi> but
<hi>errare,</hi> and accordingly it is no wonder that the
word in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8. 1. be differently rendred, and
may be so in some other places. <hi>Dam</hi> or <hi>damam</hi>
signifies either <hi>to be silent,</hi> or <hi>to wait and expect;</hi>
consequently <hi>Psal.</hi> 62. 1. may be rendred <hi>my Soul
is silent,</hi> or <hi>waiteth on God. Mahar</hi> is <hi>festinare,</hi> and
<hi>dotare</hi> or <hi>donare;</hi> and therefore in <hi>Psal. 16. 4. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haru</hi>
may be either english'd <hi>they hasten</hi> or <hi>they give
Gifts,</hi> i. e. they bring Sacrifices and Oblations, <hi>viz.
to another God.</hi> And we may suppose these zealous
Idolaters <hi>hastned</hi> to bring these <hi>Gifts,</hi> these <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi>
and then both Senses are reconciled. <hi>Palal,</hi>
according to the different Conjugations it is
in, signifies <hi>to pray</hi> and <hi>to judg:</hi> thence <hi>Psal. 106.
30.</hi> is differently translated, <hi>viz. Then stood up</hi>
Phineas <hi>and pray'd,</hi> according to our Old Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Psalms, or <hi>executed Iudgment,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the later Version. We may join both the
Senses, for it is probable this zealous Man join'd
Prayer with this eminent act of Justice. <hi>Ashar</hi> is
<hi>to walk,</hi> and to <hi>pronounce blessed,</hi> (so discrepant are
the meanings of some words;) whence <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 14.
may be english'd either <hi>go not in the way of Evil
Men</hi> (as we render it) or, <hi>bless not in the way of
Evil Men,</hi> i. e. account not, pronounce not thy self
Blessed or Happy whilst thou art in the way of Evil
Men. And so <hi>Veasher</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 19. may be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
either <hi>dirige</hi> or <hi>beatifica.</hi> Either of these
Versions yield us a good notion of the place. So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the ambiguity of the word <hi>Tizachar,</hi> which
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:46315:366"/>
may be rendred <hi>masculum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The double Signification of <hi>Puach</hi> is <hi>flare,
spirare, &amp; illaqueari:</hi> so that 'tis doubtful whether
this word in <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. 5. should be rendred <hi>pusseth

by either. <hi>Chalam</hi> is not only <hi>somniavit,</hi> but
<hi>sanus fuit, convaluit:</hi> which makes the Original
<hi>Psal.</hi> 126. 1. to be capable of either of these Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations,
<hi>we were like to them that dreamed,</hi> or <hi>we were

Versions admit of a very good Sense.</p>
                     <p>To instance in some words that have more than
two Significations; Seeing the word <hi>Pharang</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
to be <hi>abandon'd and lost,</hi> and likewise <hi>to be stript
naked,</hi> and moreover <hi>to rebel,</hi> as also <hi>to be idle,</hi> it is
not to be wonder'd at that a Clause in <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 18.
be rendred by our English Translators <hi>the People
perisheth,</hi> by others (as <hi>Coeceius) the People is made
naked,</hi> by some (as <hi>Arias Montanus) the People is
rebellious,</hi> and by others (as <hi>Pagnin) the People are,
idle.</hi> In such variety of Significations, we cannot
be Certain which to take sometimes. It is sufficient
that we choose that which we find most agreeable
to the place. <hi>Batzar</hi> in <hi>Kal</hi> is <hi>vindemiavit,</hi> in
Niphil <hi>abruptus est, sublatus est;</hi> in Piel <hi>munivit, &amp;
arduum fecit.</hi> In these several Significations 'tis
taken in Scripture, as it were easy to shew out of
the Hebrew Concordances. <hi>Bagnar</hi> according to
its different Conjugations signifies <hi>to burn, to feed,
to be furious, to be stupid or brutish, to take away or
remove;</hi> and this cannot but occasion some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in Translations. The Verb <hi>Pakad,</hi> and the
Nouns that are derived from it, are of very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious
Signification in Scripture: which must needs
cause sometimes a disagreement among Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46315:366"/>
                        <hi>Aman</hi> in <hi>Kal</hi> is <hi>nutrivit, educavit;</hi> in <hi>Niphal,

divers Examples of this in the Bible. <hi>Shur</hi> is <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere,

of the Word, I could shew that some
Texts are capable of different Versions. <hi>Tsalal</hi>
is <hi>obumbrari, opacum reddi,</hi> Ezek. 31. 3. <hi>mergi,</hi> Ex.
15. 10. <hi>tinnire, palpitare,</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 11. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 16.
<hi>Sacan</hi> is wonderfully diversified as to its Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
Sometimes it signifies to help or profit,
sometimes to attempt or make trial, sometimes to
accustom one's self to a thing: whence there may
arise some difference in translating some places;
but in none of these is any Grand Point of Religion
concern'd. <hi>Nasa</hi> hath no less than Eight Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
in the Bible, as <hi>ferre, portare: auferre,
tollere: elevare, attollere: accipere: honorare: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumere,
comburere: condonare, remittere: pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire,
nominare, jurare.</hi> And many<note n="*" place="bottom">See at the End of the Book.</note> Others Verbs
there are in this Language which have more Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
than one, and therefore those Texts where
they occur, are not so easy as others to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
There is a great variety of Significations
in the <hi>Greek</hi> Verbs, some whereof (as the Verb
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                           <hi>It hath 4 Significations,</hi> urere, discere, dividere, convivic excipere.</note>

                        </gap>) have strangely discrepant meanings, but
they are not to be compared with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ones,
whether you respect the Multiplicity of them, or
the Unlikeness and Inconsistency of the Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
among themselves. This therefore must be
assigned as one reason why the Sense of some Texts
is dubious.</p>
                     <p>As it is with the <hi>Hebrew Verbs,</hi> so it is with the
<hi>Nouns;</hi> there are many of them that have different
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46315:367"/>
Senses, and those such as have no Agreement or
Affinity one with another, which oftentimes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
Diversity of Readings in those Places where
they are found. Not but that the Hebrew Tongue
is copious, as is evident from that Variety of Names
which is for one thing. There are seven Words
for <hi>Gold,</hi> as St. <hi>Ierom</hi> long since observed, <hi>Zahab,
Phez</hi> or <hi>Paz</hi> or <hi>Ophaz, Charutz, Kethem, Ophir,
Baser, Segor;</hi> though some think that <hi>Kethem</hi> is
the more general Name, and the rest are several
kinds of Gold. There are six Words to express
<hi>Giants,</hi> as <hi>Nephilim,</hi> (from falling or falling on)
<hi>Emim,</hi> (because they are Terrible) <hi>Gibborim,</hi> (from
their Strength) <hi>Anakim, Zamzummim, Rephaim.</hi>
There are as many Words to signify a <hi>Lion,</hi> as
<note n="*" place="bottom">Lexicon. ex Talmud. in Sanhedrim.</note> 
                        <hi>Buxtorf</hi> reckons them up distinctly, with the
Places of Scripture where they occur: Yea, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>
adds a seventh. A <hi>Son</hi> in Hebrew is <hi>Ben, Nin,
Manon, Bar,</hi> though indeed this last be rather a
Chaldee or Syriac Word. <hi>Anger</hi> hath these Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
<hi>Aph, Charon, Zagnaph, Chagnas. Sleep</hi>
is either <hi>Tarmedah,</hi> or <hi>Shenah,</hi> or <hi>Tenumah.</hi> Three
Words there are for the <hi>Sun,</hi> as <hi>Cheres, Shemeth,
Chammah;</hi> and as many for the <hi>Earth, Eretz, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
Adamah.</hi> A <hi>Virgin</hi> is called <hi>Almah,</hi> (or <hi>Gnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi>)
<hi>Naarah, Bethulah. To fear</hi> is expressed by
three Verbs, <hi>viz. Gur, Iare, Pachad.</hi> The same
Hill is call'd <hi>Horeb</hi> and <hi>Sinai:</hi> and <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Hermon</hi>
are two Names of another Hill: but of these after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
Thus the Hebrew Tongue hath many Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonimous
Words.</p>
                     <p>But that which is more usual and remarkable
(and which we are concern'd to observe at present)
is that one Name or Word serves for Different.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:46315:367"/>
things, which often renders the Interpretation
doubtful. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> 4. 18. we read thus, <hi>his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
he charged with Folly;</hi> but it may as well be read,
<hi>be put Light into his Angels;</hi> and so <hi>Tremellius</hi> and
the Gallick Version have it: for [<hi>Toholah</hi>] (which
is the Word here used, and comes from a Hebrew
Verb, which sometimes signifies to shine) denotes
both <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Folly.</hi> And accordingly Expositors
(to whom I refer the Reader) labour to defend ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these Senses. But so far as I can discern
the Meaning of this Place, the Hebrew Word hath
a third Signification, which seems to be peculiarly
designed here: For this Noun is derived from <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lal,</hi>
the primitive and known Signification of which
is <hi>laudare, gloriari,</hi> and so <hi>Tohalah</hi> is as much as
<hi>Tehillah, laus, gloriatio.</hi> Accordingly I render the
foresaid Clause thus, <hi>Nec in Angelis suis ponet lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
seu gloriationem:</hi> for the <hi>Vau</hi> in this Place (as
in several others, which I have hinted before) is
Disjunctive, and is the same with <hi>nec.</hi> And you
see the Words run this way, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the Negative,
<hi>He putteth no Trust in his Servants, nor doth he put
Praise or Boasting in his Angels; i. e.</hi> those Glorious
Spirits who now inhabit the Celestial Regions, (for
I do not think, as some do, that the Fallen Angels
are here spoken of) even these in comparison of
<hi>God,</hi> who is infinitely pure and perfect, are blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
and guilty. So that this rendring of the
Words amounts to the Sense of the <hi>English</hi> Version:
but I do not see any Reason to translate the Hebrew
word <hi>Folly;</hi> for the Verb from whence it comes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
us not to it, and we have Instance of it in
Scripture. It is well known that the Noun <hi>Dabar</hi>
signifies both a <hi>Thing</hi> or <hi>Action,</hi> and a <hi>Word,</hi> and
for that reason the rendring of it in Scripture is
sometimes uncertain. The like may be observed
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:46315:368"/>
of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the Greek Testament, which is applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to Actions as well as Words, in imitation of the
use of the word <hi>Dabar.</hi> But both in the Old and
New Testament the Matter spoken of will direct us
sufficiently unto the peculiar Acception of the
Word. <hi>Shephattaim</hi> are either the <hi>Lots</hi> and <hi>Portions</hi>
of a Man's Life, and especially his ill Lot and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune;
or the Word signifies those <hi>Pots,</hi> some
say those <hi>Ranges</hi> which are used about the Fire, and
are covered over with Dust and Smoke. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 13. may be translated thus, <hi>Though
ye have lain in those evil Lots, i. e.</hi> though you have
been in great Distress: or thus, <hi>Though ye have
lain among the Pots</hi> or <hi>Ranges,</hi> which amounts to
the same Sense with the former, and expresseth
the Distressed Condition of the Persons spoken of.
The word <hi>Belial</hi> (which is often used) is of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Signification; for some derive it form <hi>Boli, non,</hi>
and <hi>Guol, jugum,</hi> and then it denotes <hi>one without a
Yoke,</hi> that is, impatient of Discipline, one that
casts off all Laws and Restraints. Others deduce
it from <hi>Beli, non,</hi> and <hi>Iagnal, profuit;</hi> so that it should
regularly be <hi>Belijagnal,</hi> but the middle Letter being
struck out, it is <hi>Belial</hi> (which way of Contraction
is not unusual, as we see in the word <hi>Hosanna,</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
from <hi>Hosignanna:</hi> so <hi>Path</hi> is a Contraction
of <hi>Pathah, frangere; Rab</hi> of <hi>Rabab, multiplicari;
El</hi> of <hi>Ejal, potentia; Iordan</hi> of <hi>Ieordan,</hi> as some
think from <hi>Ieor</hi> a River, and <hi>Dan</hi> a City; because
this River had its Rise about that Place: and there
are almost innumerable Instances of this Abbrevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

it is equivalent to <hi>Inutilis, homo nequam, nullius
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46315:368"/>

                        <hi>Marphe</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 30. may be derived either
from <hi>Rapha, sanare,</hi> or <hi>Raphah, lenem esse,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
is both <hi>sanitas</hi> and <hi>lenitas;</hi> and so that
Text may be read, <hi>a sound Heart,</hi> (a Healthful
Constitution) or <hi>a mild Heart</hi> (a placid and sedate
Temper) <hi>is the Life of the Flesh,</hi> is a Procurer of
long Life to a Man. Both the Senses are coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
<hi>Netseach</hi> signifies <hi>Victory</hi> and <hi>Eternity,</hi> (as

admits of this double Version, <hi>He will swallow up
Death in Victory,</hi> (he will conquer and bafflle its
Force) or <hi>in Eternity,</hi> i. e. Death shall be absorp'd,
destroy'd <hi>for ever.</hi> The Sense is alike. The Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of <hi>Bochal</hi> is <hi>probatio</hi> and <hi>munitio:</hi> thence
<hi>Eben bochal,</hi> Isa. 28. 16. may be rendred <hi>a tried
Stone,</hi> or <hi>Stone of Trial,</hi> or else <hi>a Stone of Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Migreshoth</hi> may denote either <hi>Suburbs</hi> (as the
word in the singular Number <hi>Migrash</hi> often doth in
Scripture) or <hi>Waves:</hi> and therefore in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27.
28. we cannot certainly tell which Word to render
it by, nor is it material whether we do or no.
Whether <hi>Hamon,</hi> Ezek. 7. 11. should be translated
a <hi>Tumult</hi> or a <hi>Multitude,</hi> is not to be decided; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
if the Word comes from <hi>Hamah, tumultuatus
est,</hi> then the former Version is the genuine one;
but if from <hi>Haman, multiplicavit,</hi> then the latter.
Whether <hi>Chajil,</hi> Ezek. 37. 10. is to be translated
<hi>an Army</hi> (as we english it) or <hi>People,</hi> cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
because the Word signifies both in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Places of Scripture. Because <hi>Zaba</hi> denotes both
<hi>a determinate Time,</hi> and <hi>military Order,</hi> that of <hi>Iob</hi>
7. 1. may be rendred either thus, <hi>Is there not an
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46315:369"/>
appointed time to Man?</hi> or, <hi>Is there not a Warfare to
Man?</hi> And so in <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 14. you may read it, <hi>All
the Days of my appointed Time,</hi> or, <hi>all the Days of my
Warfare.</hi> In all these Places there is no point of
Religion endanger'd, if you take the Words in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sense. There must needs be a double Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Iosh.</hi> 11. 20. because the word <hi>Techinnah</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Favour,</hi> and likewise <hi>Prayer</hi> or <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication:</hi>

there might be no Favour for them,</hi> or <hi>that there might
be no Supplication for them.</hi> Both which Senses may
be united thus, <hi>that there might be none to pray for
Grace and Favour for them.</hi> And so both the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations

the Sacred Writings, to as great a Multiplicity of
Meanings, as might easily be proved. And to
conclude, the word <hi>Iad</hi> is of a vast Latitude; I
know none that equals it as to its wonderful Variety
of Senses. It is to be understood and applied at
least twenty several ways in the Old Testament:
but yet, though it is sometimes difficult, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
impossible to distinguish the Senses, These
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46315:370"/>
Words and many<note n="*" place="bottom">See at the end of the Book.</note> more are Proofs of what I at
first asserted, that there is a great Number of Words
in the Scripture of <hi>Different Significations,</hi> and that
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue especially abounds with such.
For the Hebrews have but few Words, very few in
comparison of what there are in other Languages;
but they make their small Stock go as far as it can,
by making one Word serve for diverse things, so
that oftentimes the subject Matter must determine
the Signification. I need say no more. Look but
into the Margins of the English Bible, and there
you may be fully satisfied from the Diversity of
rendring the Texts, that many Nouns as well as
Verbs have different and unlike Meanings, which
we must needs apprehend to be the Cause why some
Places are Obscure and Difficult.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Many Hebrew Nouns whereby the several sorts of Brute
Animals are signified, admit of different Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which is one Reason why some Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are obscure and difficult. The Great Fish, Ion.
1. 17. which devour'd Jonas, was a Whale, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and strictly so called: but perhaps the Belly of
this Fish is not to be understood in a strict Sense of the
Abdomen or Iower Venter, but of the Wide and
Capacious Mouth of that Animal. The proper Names
of some Birds and Insects are ambiguous. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
particular Opinion concerning Kirjonim,
2 Kings 6. 25. the Doves Dung that was sold at
so dear a rate at the Siege of Samaria. What the
Locusts were that John Baptist fed on in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
The Names of Flowers, Trees, Plants, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the Bible, are somewhat uncertain. So are
the Words for Minerals, Precious Stones, Musical
Instruments. Yet this is so far from being a Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
to the Sacred Writings, that it is a Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them. The Hebrew Measures (whether of
Longitude or Capacity) are another Instance of the
Difficulty which arises from our being ignorant of the
exact Significations of some Words in the Bible. The
Words whereby the Hebrew Weights are express'd
are something dubious. And so are those whereby the
Jewish Coins are denoted. Likewise there is Vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
in the Greek and Roman Coins mentioned in
the New Testament.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN farther Prosecution of this I will observe, that
many Hebrew Words which signify <hi>Brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi>
(whether four-footed Beasts and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46315:371"/>
on the Earth, or Fishes, and Birds, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects)
admit of Different Interpretations, and may
be applied to Animals of divers kinds. It is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
both by the Antient and Modern Jews
themselves, that they have no certain Account of
the Proper Names of divers of those Animals which
are mentioned in the <hi>11th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Leviticus,</hi>
some of which were forbidden, others allowed to
be eaten by that People. When they come to speak
of some of them particularly, they exceedingly
disagree about them, and variously determine what
they are. <hi>Sus</hi> is the known Hebrew Word for a
<hi>Horse,</hi> and yet it is the Word for a <hi>Crane</hi> in <hi>Isa.</hi> 38.

ariseth out of its Trunk, and turns up: if it be the
<hi>Monoceros</hi> or <hi>Vnicorn,</hi> properly so call'd, the Horn
is in the middle of its Forehead, and exalted. St.

of it. Nor could these Learned Men have done so,

such as was in the way of a Miracle. It is said,

the Deliverance of the Prophet, by appointing this

some other Fish of the Nature of a Whale, but

                     <p>But I think there is a way to reconcile this,
and yet at the same time we may assert, that our
Saviour means a <hi>Whale</hi> properly and strictly so
called; that is, as 'tis credibly said to be, a Great
Fish with a Little Throat, so little besure that a
Man cannot have any passage through it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
that <hi>Ionas</hi> had not. If I may be allowed
to offer my particular Opinion, I conceive that
when 'tis said by the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> concerning
himself, that he <hi>was in the Belly of the Fish,</hi> Chap. 1.
17. and when it is said by our Saviour that he <hi>was
in the Belly of the Whale,</hi> Mat. 12. 40. the word
[Belly] is not to be understood in a strict Sense.

see that both these words <gap reason="foreign">

the same, and signify some dark and remote Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles,
where Things or Persons are laid up for
a time. As <hi>Ionas</hi> was <hi>in the Whale's Belly,</hi> so Christ
was <hi>in the Heart of the Earth;</hi> to acquaint us that as
the word <hi>Heart</hi> is not understood here strictly
and properly, so neither is the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as it
signifies <hi>Belly.</hi> The <hi>Heart of the Earth</hi> was the
Grave or Sepulcher where our Saviour lay, though
'twas not strictly speaking the <hi>Heart:</hi> so by the
Whale's <hi>Belly</hi> is meant the place where <hi>Ionas</hi> was
held and imprison'd, though it was not the <hi>Belly</hi>
in the strictness of Speech. But as the <hi>Grave</hi> is to
the <hi>Earth,</hi> so is the <hi>Mouth</hi> to the <hi>Body:</hi> our Saviour
was hidden in the one, <hi>Ionas</hi> was preserv'd in the

<hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 15. out of which by certain
Pipes or Cocks they let out the Water in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.
And further it might be observ'd, that
those words which express these inward and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Parts have their Denomination from the <hi>hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowness</hi>
of them, as <hi>Kebah, ventriculus,</hi> is from <hi>Kab</hi> or
<hi>Kabab, cavavit:</hi> and so <hi>Kobah</hi> (of the same Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication)
is from the same Root, and is so named
from its <hi>Cavity,</hi> and that for this reason, because
these inward Vessels and Parts are able to hold and
contain things, and also are Channels and Passages
to convey and transmit them. These are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and are call'd so from their hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and capaciousness. Thus in the Matter before
us, though we do not restrain <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

the <hi>Belly</hi> strictly so named, yet we take it in
its proper and genuine Denotation, that is, as it
signifies that Vast and Wide Cavity of the Whale
which <hi>Ionas</hi> was taken into; in this <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, in this
Capacious Hollowness was the distressed Prophet
lodged three Days and three Nights. In this <hi>Belly
of Hell</hi> (for so likewise he calls it, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. 2. and
by this Phrase we further see that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
which is the word here used by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi>
is not properly taken, but signifies some Dark In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Receptacle) he was both tormented and
preserved: and at last, as we read in the Sequel
of this History, when <hi>the Lord spake unto this Fish,
it vomited out</hi> Jonah <hi>on the dry Land,</hi> Chap. 2. 10.
which (let me observe to you) further intimates to
us the truth of this Notion which I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to you, for <hi>Vomiting</hi> is an Emission of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
not out of the Belly, but out of the Mouth
or Stomach. If <hi>Ionas</hi> had been in the Belly or
Entrails of the Fish, he had been emitted another
way, not by Vomition. Thus I have briefly given
my Conceptions of that Text of Scripture, and
from the whole it is evident that it speaks of a
<hi>Whale</hi> properly so call'd, (for our Blessed Saviour
positively and expresly determines it to be such)
and of the Vast Cavity of its <hi>Mouth</hi> and <hi>Iaws,</hi>
which in respect of their huge extension, may
deserve the Name of a <hi>Belly,</hi> rather than of those
Parts. I know that the Almighty God, who made
the Creature at first, could afterwards have fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and disposed its Throat, or any other Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as he pleas'd: With the greatest Reverence I
acknowledg this. But if we can solve the Works
of God and his Providence in a natural way, I think
we are obliged to do it, and at the same time we
adore the God of Nature. Although it must be
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46315:375"/>
confess'd, that if we respect the Power and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,
the Providence and Will of God, it might
be the <hi>Belly</hi> of this Fish properly so denominated,
which was the Place where the Fugitive Prophet
was lodged; yet seeing Naturalists have given us
this Account of the Whale, that the Passage of its
Throat is so strait, that a Man's Body cannot be
convey'd through it; and seeing we are not sure
that God alter'd the Frame and Disposition of this
Part; and seeing likewise that the Word which the
Holy Ghost useth is capable of a double Sense, we
may be invited on these Considerations to think
that it was the <hi>Vast Mouth</hi> of this Fish which is
here meant. And truly the Wonderfulness of the
Occurrence is not at all hereby abated; for to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<hi>Ionas</hi> so long in the Whale's Mouth, was as
great a Miracle (if we consider all things) as to
preserve him in its Lower Belly.</p>
                     <p>Then as for <hi>Fowls, Birds,</hi> and <hi>Insects,</hi> there is a
great Ambiguity in the Old Testament, as to some
of these. <hi>Tsippor</hi> is a common Name of all Fowls,
as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 17. and other Places: but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it is more particularly taken for a <hi>Sparrow,</hi> as
in <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 7. So in <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 3. some certain Species
of Birds are signified, because the <hi>Swallow</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the same Place. <hi>Kore,</hi> 1 Sam. 26. 20.
which we translate a <hi>Partridg,</hi> is a <hi>Night-raven,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the 70 Interpreters: It is a <hi>Woodcock</hi> or
<hi>Snipe,</hi> saith<note n="*" place="bottom">Bochart. de Anim. Sacr.</note> One whom I have often quoted. <hi>Ajah,
Lev. 11. 14. Iob</hi> 28: 7. is rendred in the Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint

but according to <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> it is <hi>varia a vis,
i. e.</hi> a <hi>Pie:</hi> according to others it is a <hi>Crow;</hi> and
'tis thought by others to be a <hi>Kite:</hi> But we need not
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46315:376"/>
be solicitous to know which of these it is, for it is
likely we can never attain it; or if we could, it
would be of little Advantage to us, for the Sense
of these Places of Scripture depends not on our
knowing what sort of Animal this or that is. <hi>Deror,
Psal.</hi> 84. 4. is in our English Translation a <hi>Swallow,</hi>
but according to the Greek and Latin it is a <hi>Turtle,</hi>
and so <hi>Bochart</hi> indeavours to prove. <hi>Kippod,</hi> which
we translate a <hi>Bittern,</hi> Isa. 14. 23. <hi>ch.</hi> 34. 11. is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>R. Solomon</hi> a kind of <hi>Owl;</hi> but <hi>Luther</hi>
will have it to be an <hi>Eagle.</hi> Yea, some rank it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other Species of Animals, for according to
the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> and <hi>Pagnin</hi> it is a <hi>Hedg-hog;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>R. Kimchi</hi> and <hi>R. Ioseph,</hi> a <hi>Snail;</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to others, a <hi>Beaver. Avenarius</hi> comes nearest
the Truth, who tells us it is the Name of a Fowl

of, (and we need not look any further) that
it is some Fowl or other Animal that frequents <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert</hi>
and <hi>desolate Places,</hi> because of these the Text
speaks. So when the Psalmist complains that <hi>he is
like a Pelican in the Wilderness, and like an Owl of the
Desart,</hi> Psal. 102. 6. we need not be inquisitive
whether the former word <hi>Kaath</hi> be rightly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated,
or whether it should be rendred a <hi>Bittern,</hi>
as 'tis by <hi>Ierom</hi> and <hi>Bochart;</hi> nor are we to care
whether that latter word <hi>Kos</hi> certainly signifies that

<hi>I. R. Kimchi</hi> was in the right, who saith, 'tis the
Name of some unclean Bird not known to us. But
this is enough, that it was some Solitary Creature
of the feather'd Order that kept in remote Places,

but we cannot tell when they are, or when

help for this in the World, unless you can suppose
that some Criticks are infallible. This only we
can do; after a diligent and impartial Search into
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46315:377"/>
the different Opinions concerning the Words, we
may acquiesce in that which we think to be most

                     <p>Here I will insert something concerning that Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in 2 <hi>Kings 6. 25. The fourth part of a Cab of
Doves Dung was sold for five pieces of Silver;</hi> which
refers to a known sort of <hi>Fowls,</hi> but hath been much
controverted by Critical Expositors. What is the
true Import here of <hi>Kirjonim</hi> (which we translate
<hi>Doves Dung</hi>) is not easy to determine; for some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
the former part of the Word from <hi>Charar, sic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citas,
calor, exustio:</hi> and others from <hi>Chur,</hi> which
hath various Significations, as <hi>Whiteness,</hi> a <hi>Hole,</hi> or
<hi>hollow Place,</hi> a <hi>Paunch, Dung.</hi> And the Talmudists
read it <hi>Dibjonim,</hi> because forsooth 'tis a modester
Word. Some think it to be <hi>Dung,</hi> properly so
call'd, the <hi>Execrement</hi> of Pigeons; but then they
much differ about the Use of it. <hi>Rabbi Ionas,</hi> one
of the chiefest of the Jewish Doctors, hath this
Concelt, that in the time of the Siege they used
Doves Dung dried to kindle their Fires: this serv'd
the People of <hi>Samaria</hi> instead of Sticks, which now
were not to be had. But this seems to be an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Fancy, because (besides that 'tis questiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
whether this could be made serviceable for Few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el)
the Text speaks of Scarcity and want of Food,
not of Firing. The Famine was so great, that not
only an <hi>Ass's Head,</hi> but this <hi>Kirjonim</hi> (which was
some Edible) was sold at an excessive rate. Others
say they used <hi>Doves Dung,</hi> in the time of the Siege,
instead of Salt. But this is as groundless as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Opinion, for (not to dispute whether the

Another tells us, that it was to dung their Fields
within the City, that they might have a Harvest
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46315:377"/>
at home the ensuing Year, if the Siege should last;
and they were not permitted to go abroad. But
this is no ways credible, for either they had much
Ground within the City for that purpose, or they
had but little. The former is wholly improbable,
for in frequented Cities (such as <hi>Samaria</hi> was) their
Habitations take up the greatest part of the Place;
so that there is but little left for Arable. And if
there was but little, it was not worth their Time
and Pains to bestow Compost upon it. Moreover,
'tis reasonable to think that those distress'd fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

Creatures were eager about relieving their
present Wants, but were not concern'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
against the ensuing Year. Another of the
Jewish Rabbies understands this <hi>Kirjonim,</hi> of that
which was contained in the Crop or Maw of Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the Corn they had pick'd up in the Fields;
this (saith he) was taken out when they return'd
back, and was eaten for want of better Food. But
this Rabbi forgot that when the Famine was so
grievous and pressing, it is likely the Pigeons were
seized on in their Houses, and not suffer'd to fly
abroad. Or supposing this latter, yet we are to
remember that the Fields about <hi>Samaria</hi> were
stripp'd of their Corn at that time, and therefore
those Animals could not return home with that
Prey. Others think the <hi>Guts</hi> and <hi>Entrails</hi> of Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are meant here by this Word; but why they
rather than the Garbage of Other Fowls should be
mentioned, is not accountable. Monsieur <hi>Bochart,</hi>
the Great <hi>Goliah</hi>-Critick, tells us, it signifies none
of these, but he gives us an Invention of his own,
<hi>viz.</hi> that this <hi>Kirjonim</hi> is a sort of <hi>Cicer,</hi> a Coarse
kind of Food, but such as the Jews sometimes did
eat. it is the same, he saith, with <hi>Kali,</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
17. 28. and this is the Name that the Arabians
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:46315:378"/>
give it. But this Learned Author may receive a
Confutation from that Text it self; for if this <hi>Kali</hi>
had been any Coarse contemptible Food, 'tis not
at all probable that the Persons there mentioned
would have made a Present of it to King <hi>David.</hi>
Questionless they brought of the best Provision to
him, and this sufficiently appears from the other
Gifts which are in the same Place enumerated.
This <hi>Kali</hi> is rendred by the Vulgar Latin <hi>Polenta,</hi>
and by our Translators <hi>parched Corn;</hi> perhaps
parch'd and dried after it had been soak'd in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and was a kind of an early Essay of <hi>Malt.</hi>
But whatever it was, it is evident that it was some
Choice Present, and therefore this last Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not to be allowed. But what is, is very
hard to tell. I subscribe to this Learned Writer in
this, that <hi>Grain</hi> or <hi>Corn</hi> is here meant. But it was
not any <hi>one particular</hi> sort of them, nor could it be
that <hi>Kali</hi> before-mentioned. Wherefore, if I may
have leave to give in my Conjecture, (after all that
hath been said) it is this, that this <hi>Kirjonim</hi> was
the <hi>Offals</hi> or <hi>Refuse</hi> of all sorts of Corn and Grain,
which was wont to be given to Pigeons at such
time of the Year, when they had nothing abroad
to feed on. For the Jews tell us, that they anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
kept Pigeons in certain Houses and Places
built on purpose for them, (as 'tis with us at this
Day) and there relieved them with Food when
there was occasion. This Refuse-Grain, this Tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Corn,
these Sweepings of the Floor, these vile
Remains, are here call'd <hi>Dung,</hi> by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
This comports with the Stile of Scripture,
which uses the word<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Kings 9. 37. Psal. 83. 10. Jer. 8. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Dung</hi> to denote the <hi>Baseness</hi>
and <hi>Vileness</hi> of a thing: and here it is join'd with
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46315:378"/>
                        <hi>an Ass's Head,</hi> which was the Vilest sort of Food;
and therefore both together do fully express the
Extremity of the Famine at that time. And also
this Vile Dross and Siftings of all kind of Grain
might be call'd <hi>Dung</hi> by them, because these being
very gross, yielded abundant Matter for Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
This seems to me to be a very plain and
obvious Interpretation of the Hebrew Word, but
let the Reader be Judg. It is certain it can't be
meant of <hi>Pigeons Dung,</hi> strictly so call'd, for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
humane Excrements, nor any others, are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being Food. If we meet with any thing
to the contrary, as in <hi>Isa. 36. 12. 2 Kings</hi> 18. 27.
it is spoken in an Hyperbolical Strain. But no
more of this ungrateful Subject. Perhaps we have
lost the true Meaning of <hi>Kirjonim.</hi> Such Words
and Names of things as these, which are of no fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Use, by reason of their great Antiquity, are
forgot, and not known by us. And this is not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the Hebrew Tongue alone; the very same
happens in other Languages, which are not so
Antient, as it were easy to demonstrate.</p>
                     <p>Then as to <hi>insects,</hi> the Word which we render
a <hi>Spider,</hi> Prov. 30. 28. is <hi>Stellio</hi> in the Old Latin
Version: and the Inquisitive <hi>Bochart</hi> labours to make
it probable, that that is the Creature there meant,

I will mention here the <hi>Locusts,</hi> Lev. 11. 22.

that they were the usual Sustenance of some People

that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> fed on these Animals in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
it being a sort of Food that the Hebrew Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were no Strangers to, and consequently that
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:46315:380"/>
this is the true Interpretation of <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 4.? But it
must be acknowledg'd, that Other Texts are not
so easily understood: there is a great Ambiguity
in those words whereby <hi>Animals</hi> are express'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
'tis somewhat difficult to reach the true meaning
of them, as may sufficiently appear from what
Monsieur <hi>Bochart</hi> hath said of those Animals that
are spoken of in Scripture: though truly I am of
opinion, that that Great Man hath sometimes (if
not often) rais'd Doubts about them when there
was little or no Ground for it, as 'tis the fault
of almost all Great Criticks to render Words
and Things dubious when there is no occasion
for it.</p>
                     <p>In the next place, I will observe that the Names
of <hi>Flowers, Plants</hi> and <hi>Herbs</hi> among the Hebrews
are scarcely known to us. Otherwise certainly
the Hebrew word which in our English Bibles is
rendred a <hi>Rose,</hi> Cant. 2. 1. Isa. 35. 1. would not
have been translated a <hi>Flower</hi> in the former place,
and a <hi>Lilly</hi> in the latter by the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Interpreter.
And<note n="*" place="bottom">Lexic. Hebraic.</note> 
                        <hi>Buxtorf</hi> was so sensible of the ambiguous

And the Geneva, Helvetian and Danish Bibles
retain the Hebrew word <hi>Kikaion,</hi> because they
knew not what to make of it. Nor are Authors
less divided about the <hi>Gopher-wood,</hi> Gen. 6. 14.

Seven or Eight sorts of Trees are mention'd by
them on this occasion. Some say it is <hi>Square-Timber,</hi>

and most of the Rabins, it is <hi>Cedar:</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Munster</hi> and the Geneva Translation, it is

concerning it, that among the Gentiles the
Cypress was always held to be a Fatal Tree, and
was used at Funerals, because the Ark at the Flood,

made of this Wood. Some take it for a <hi>Fir,</hi> and

sort of Tree, but that it was made of divers Kinds.
But the Translators of the English Bible retain the

take it to be the <hi>White-Thorn,</hi> or a Tree
very like it. The truth is, we are certain of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but this, that it was some very excellent
and choice Wood which they found to be very
Useful in Building. It is probable that it was
denominated from the Place where it grew, and
whence it was fetched, (for of <hi>Shittim</hi> we read in
<hi>Numb. 25. 1. Iosh.</hi> 2. 1. and in other places) but
<hi>what kind</hi> of Tree it was, is uncertain: for which
reason both the Vulgar Latin and English Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
thought fit to retain the Hebrew word it self.
For we are in the dark as to these things: and
how can it be otherwise, seeing 'tis not to be

some Interpreters a <hi>Topaz,</hi> and by others a <hi>Ruby.</hi>
And there is almost the like difference in inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting
some of the other Words whereby other
Stones are signified. For indeed, it is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the Hebrew Doctors, as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> and
others tell us, that the Names of <hi>Precious Stones</hi> in
Scripture are unknown to us. There is such a
discrepancy, saith a<note n="‖" place="bottom">Paul. Fagius in Exod. 28. 20.</note> Learned Hebrician, about
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:46315:382"/>
these among all Interpreters, whether Christians
or Jews, that no Man is able to determine any
thing certain.</p>
                     <p>The same may be said of <hi>Musical Instruments</hi>
mention'd in Scripture: which have employ'd
many Criticks and Grammarians, but with little
Satisfaction. But I have said enough for my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> to shew you that the <hi>Hebrew
Names</hi> of divers things are not well understood,
which sometimes begets a misunderstanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the things themselves. There are indeed
among the Greeks and Latins a great number of
words of Different Senses, but the number is far
greater in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> by reason of the paucity of
words in this Tongue; for there being many
Things, but few Words to express them, it will
follow that sundry of them must be of various
Significations, and consequently that it is no easy
matter to distinguish between them. This may be
the reason why the <hi>Septuagint</hi> have inserted seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Hebrew</hi> words into their Version, namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they could not tell how to express them in
Greek, their Signification being so Doubtful. Hence
also some <hi>Proper Names</hi> are translated by these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
as <hi>Appellatives;</hi> which is done also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> because those Names
are seemingly and as to their Sound no other than
Appellatives: however, the Dubious meaning of
them prompted the Translators to take them as
such. Nor are we to think that this <hi>Ambiguity</hi> is
any Blemish or Disparagement to the Bible, and
that for this reason, because we find it no where
but in those Matters which are Indifferent, and the
Knowledg of which is not indispensably required
of us. Nay, on the contrary, this <hi>Difficulty</hi> which
we meet with in many Words and Passages in these
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46315:382"/>
Holy Writings, is so far from disparaging them,
that it is an undeniable Proof of the Unparallell'd
<hi>Antiquity</hi> of them. We are assured hence, that
they have the Priority of all other Books; we may
rationally gather that a great part of this Volume
at least was composed and written before any
other Writings were extant. If this Sacred Book
were of a later Date, we should have had few or
none of those Difficult Terms that it abounds with
now. We could not then have a more Convincing
Argument of its being Exceeding <hi>Antient,</hi> than its
being <hi>Dark</hi> in some places. And therefore instead
of complaining of the Obscurity of these Writings,
let us reverence and admire its Matchless Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
and congratulate our own Happiness, that
the Divine Providence hath entrusted us with the
First and Oldest Records of Truth in the World.</p>
                     <p>I will go on then still with my present Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
and shew in other particulars the <hi>Dubious
Import</hi> of some words in these Sacred Writings,
and attempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to clear some of them. I will here
speak of the <hi>Measures, Weights,</hi> and <hi>Coins</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in Scripture, which are another Instance of
the <hi>Difficulty</hi> which arises from our being ignorant
of the exact Significations of some Words in the
Sacred Volume. The <hi>Hebrew Measures</hi> are either
of <hi>Application</hi> or of <hi>Capacity,</hi> i. e. such Measures
as are applied and laid unto things, or such as hold
and contain things. To the former sort belongs
chiefly the <hi>Gubit,</hi> the famous Standing Measure of
the Hebrews. But this is twofold, either <hi>Common</hi>
or <hi>Sacred:</hi> the former is the length of the Arm
from the Elbow to the end of the middle Finger,
according to the Dimensions of Men of the greatest
Stature; and it is generally agreed that this is a
Foot and a half, or (which is the same) half a
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46315:383"/>
Yard. This was the Measure for ordinary things,
as <hi>Ogg</hi>'s <hi>Bedstead,</hi> which was<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. 3. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>in length nine Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,</hi>
i. e. thirteen Foot and a half, or four Yards
and a half, and <hi>in breadth four Cubits,</hi> i. e. six Foot,
or two Yards: by which it appears, that he was
such another Giant as <hi>Goliah</hi> was,<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Sam. 17. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>whose height
was six Cubits and a Span,</hi> i. e. nine Foot and nine
Inches, or three Yards and almost a Foot: for we
must suppose that his Bedstead was a fourth part or
thereabouts longer than his Body. But besides this
ordinary Cubit, call'd the <hi>Cubit of a Man,</hi> Deut. 3.
11. <hi>i. e.</hi> of a Man's Proportion, from the Elbow to
the Fingers end, the Common Cubit, there was
the Sacred one, which is as much again, <hi>viz.</hi> a
Yard. By this were measured those things which
were Extraordinary and Unusual, or which were
Holy and Religious. Some think the length,
breadth and height of the <hi>Ark</hi> is measured by
this Cubit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 15. otherwise they cannot make
room for all the Creatures of every Kind that
were to be lodged in it. Yea, two of the Antient
<note n="‖" place="bottom">Origen. Hom. 2. in Gen. Augustin. de Civ. Del, l. 15. c. 27.</note> Fathers think that the Cubit by which the Ark
was built, was the <hi>Geometrick</hi> one, which is six times
longer than the Ordinary Cubit, <hi>i. e.</hi> it contains
nine Foot: for they thought that the Ark other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
could not hold all the Beasts. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
is stifly maintain'd by<note n="*" place="bottom">But<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Geometrick Cubit, because there is no mention
of it in Scripture, and because the Fabrick of the
Ark would have been of two vast a proportion if
it had been measur'd by this. These Men with
the Ordinary Cubit make that Vessel large enough
to hold all the different Animals that were order'd
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46315:383"/>
to be preserv'd in it. <hi>Buteo</hi> more especially hath
undertaken this, and perform'd it as well as the
thing would bear. He insists that <hi>Moses</hi> speaks of
the Cubit that was most in use in his time, which
by consent of Writers contain'd a Foot and a half
in length: and accordingly he endeavours to make
the whole Business of the Fabrick and Capacity
of the Ark for receiving the several Creatures, to
be accountable on this Hypothesis of the <hi>Common
Cubit.</hi> When the Mosaick History relates that
the Longitude of the Ark was three hundred
Cubits, we must understand it, he saith, of four
hundred fifty Foot in length: when it describes
its Latitude to be fifty Cubits, there are meant
seventy five Foot: and when the Altitude is said
to be thirty Cubits, we must reckon forty five
Foot. This was the Proportion of that Antient
Fabrick, of that great <hi>Swimming Coffin,</hi> for its
Figure agrees most with that Shape. But whereas
we read that it consisted of <hi>three Stories,</hi> ver. 16.
this Author assigns <hi>four,</hi> telling us, that the first
(which he adds) is not mention'd, because it was
a Sink or Sewer to receive all the Filth that
came from the Stalls of the Animals: the next to
this, was the place where the Terrestrial Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
were lodg'd: The Third was the Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house
for Provision let down to the Creatures
below through Racks: In the Fourth were the
Men and Birds. And these Rooms and Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with their Accommodations, are reduced
by him to that number of Cubits which <hi>Noah</hi>
assigns. So that the Cavils of <hi>Celsus,</hi> and of the
Gnosticks before him, against the incapacity of
the Ark for so many Beasts, are silenc'd by the
Undertaking of this Ingenious Writer, who hath
proved that this Structure was able to hold very
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46315:384"/>
well all <hi>Speoies</hi> of Animals, <hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>Creeping things,</hi>
which according to <hi>Gesner</hi> and <hi>Aldrovandus,</hi> are
not above thirty, and of <hi>Four-footed Beasts,</hi> which
are a hundred and thirty, (for <hi>Antilopes</hi> begot
between a Hart and a Goat, <hi>Mules</hi> the Product
of an Horse and an Ass, <hi>Iackals</hi> of whom a
Wolf is the Sire, a Fox the Dam, and some other
such Mungrel Creatures are not to be reckon'd
in the Number) and of <hi>Fowls of the Air</hi> about a
hundred and fifty.</p>
                     <p>As to the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> it is granted
that the Dimensions of them are taken by the
<hi>Holy Cubit,</hi> which is as long again as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
one. But then, whether the <hi>Vtensils</hi> and
<hi>Vessels,</hi> and other things belonging to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are to be measured by the <hi>Common</hi> or the
<hi>Sacred Cubit,</hi> is often disputed among those who
have treated of this Matter. And it must needs
be so, because the word <hi>Ammah, cubitus,</hi> is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous;
for though it never signifies in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the <hi>Geometrical Cubit,</hi> which is three Yards,
yet it is left uncertain in many places whether
the Common or Sacred Cubit be meant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Measures</hi> of <hi>Capacity</hi> among the Hebrews are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of things that are <hi>Dry,</hi> or of those that are
<hi>Liquid.</hi> Of the first sort are, 1. The <hi>Cab,</hi> 2 Kings
6. 25. the Least of Dry Measures used by the Jews,
about a quarter of a Peck of our English Measure.
2. The <hi>Ephah,</hi> Lev. 5. 11. of the same Quantity
with the <hi>Bath,</hi> (of which afterwards) only the one
is for dry things, the other for wet. It may be
call'd the <hi>Hebrew Bushel,</hi> because it is much about
that Quantity; though some will have it to be
much more, and others a considerable deal less,
<hi>viz.</hi> half a Bushel and a Pottle. Some say it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
about seven Gallons, others nine. So that we

cannot tell the precise Quantity of this Measure;

which is ten <hi>Baths</hi> or <hi>Ephahs, i. e.</hi> ten Bushels, say
some: but others set it higher, making it fourteen
Bushels; and others bring it lower, reducing it to
about eight Bushels. Perhaps the English word
<hi>Coumb</hi> or <hi>Coume,</hi> which now signifies but half as
much, denoted a greater Quantity heretofore, and
was originally taken from the Hebrew <hi>Chomer,</hi> but
is since corrupted in the Pronunciation. Note that
this is the Greatest (however the just and exact
Quantity be disputed) of all <hi>Dry Measures.</hi> 4. An
<hi>Omer, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, Gnomer,</hi> Vulgar Latin <hi>Gomor.</hi> It is
true, some Writers (and of no mean Note) have
confounded these two, <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Omer,</hi> and the
Seventy Interpreters did so long before, calling
both of them <gap reason="foreign">

Measures. For we are assured that <hi>an Omer is the
tenth part of an Ephah,</hi> Exod. 16. 36. <hi>i. e.</hi> the tenth
part of a Bushel, or thereabouts; and therefore is
call'd by the Jews <hi>Gnisharon, decima,</hi> a <hi>tenth-deal,
Numb.</hi> 15. 4. whereas the <hi>Homer</hi> contained ten
<hi>Ephahs</hi> or <hi>Baths, i. e.</hi> ten Bushels. But yet this is
an Equivocal Word, as appears from <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 10.
<hi>Ye shall bring a Sheaf of the first Fruits of your Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest

usual Signification of <hi>Omer.</hi> But in all other places
the <hi>Hebrew Name</hi> it self is retain'd in the <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latin</hi> Versions as well as in Ours; and I have told
you what it is generally thought to signify. 5. The
<hi>Cor,</hi> 1 Kings 4. 22. which is made by some a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Measure from those before-named: but you
will find, that according to the Vulgar Latin, a
<hi>Cor</hi> and an <hi>Homer</hi> are the same, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45. 13, 14.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Measures for Liquids</hi> among the Hebrews
were a <hi>Log, Lev.</hi> 14. 10. which contain'd about
half a Pint: however, this is sure that it was the
least of Liquid Measures. Next, a <hi>Hin,</hi> Numb.
15. 4. which was somewhat bigger than a <hi>Log:</hi>
some say it held ten <hi>Logs,</hi> a <hi>Great Gallon</hi> I may call
it. A <hi>Bath,</hi> Ezek. 45. 11. was yet bigger, and
contain'd six <hi>Hins, i. e.</hi> about six <hi>Gallons:</hi> others
say, four <hi>Gallons</hi> and an half. And yet it is said to
be of the same Capacity with the <hi>Ephah, i. e.</hi> a
Bushel, and consequently should hold eight Gallons.
The <hi>Homer</hi> was also a Measure for Liquor, as well
as for Grain, and it contained ten Baths, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from <hi>Ezek. 45. 14. Ten Baths are an Homer.</hi>
But because a <hi>Bath</hi> is more or less, according to the
different Determinations of Writers, we cannot
assign the exact Quantity of an <hi>Homer.</hi> A <hi>Cor</hi>
(which I before mentioned as the same with the
<hi>Chomer,</hi> and the greatest of Dry Measures) is also a
Measure for Liquids, 1 <hi>Kings 5. 11. Ezek.</hi> 45. 14.
But 'tis no wonder that we have not an exact
Knowledg of these <hi>Iewish Measures,</hi> for even those
that are mentioned in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors, and
very much fall short of the Antiquity of these, are
but little known by us.</p>
                     <p>Next, if we proceed to the Words whereby the
<hi>Hebrew Weights</hi> are expressed in Scripture, which
are the <hi>Shekel</hi> and the <hi>Talent,</hi> we shall find them
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46315:385"/>
something dubious and uncertain. The <hi>Shekel,</hi>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (like the <hi>Cubit</hi>) is said to be either <hi>Common</hi>
or <hi>Sacred,</hi> the <hi>Profane Shekel,</hi> or that of the <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</hi>
And here there is Dissention among Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
but according to the most moderate Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts,
the former is said to be in Weight a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an Ounce, the latter half an Ounce Troy.
Others affirm, that there was no <hi>Profane Shekel,</hi>
different from the <hi>Sacred one;</hi> but that the occasion
of the Opinion was the Scripture's mentioning the
<hi>Shekel of the Sanctuary,</hi> Lev. 27. 25. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.
47. which is so call'd, because the Weights which
were laid up in the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> were the Standard of
all Weights. The other Weights in use among
the People were tried by These, and if they were
found lighter, they were condemned. As for the
contrary Opinion, it is look'd upon by some (but
I cannot subscribe to it) as an Invention of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies.
The other <hi>Weight</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

the Rabins, is fifty Pounds; others say, sixty;
others, sixty two in weight. The second, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to some, is an hundred; according to others,
an hundred and twenty; and in others Estimation,
an hundred twenty five Pounds Weight, <hi>i. e.</hi> about
as much again as the <hi>Common Talent.</hi> But it is
difficult to tell in which particular Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the <hi>Common Talent</hi> is meant, and in which the
<hi>Sacred one.</hi> Only this we know, that a <hi>Talent</hi> was
the greatest <hi>Weight</hi> among the Hebrews. And
this we may rest in, as very probable, that there
was a Difference of the same Weights among the
Jews, as among us there is <hi>Troy Weight</hi> used by Gold

                     <p>Then as to the <hi>Coins,</hi> these generally followed
the <hi>Weights,</hi> because they weighed their Money
for the most part: Hence the <hi>Shekel</hi> and the <hi>Talent</hi>
were not only <hi>Weights</hi> but <hi>Coins</hi> among the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.
The <hi>Shekel of the Sanctuary</hi> was in strict Value
two Shillings four Pence of our Money, but is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
reckon'd two Shillings six Pence, our <hi>Half-Crown:</hi>
but the <hi>Ordinary S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

much, i. e. as to the most strict Value fourteen
Pence, but more generally esteem'd to be fifteen.
This is to be understood of the <hi>Shekel of Silver;</hi> but
then we must know there was <hi>another of Gold,</hi> which
was of a much higher Value, fifteen Shillings at
least. Now because the word <hi>Shekel</hi> is often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
without any Addition in Scripture, we may
be mistaken as to the right Value of it, because we
are uncertain which of the Shekels is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that of Silver or that of Gold. And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it happens by reason of the Shekels being

for the other. As probably in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 26. where
'tis said that <hi>Absalom at every Year's end polled his
Head, because the Hair was heavy on him, and he
weighed the Hair at two hundred Shekels;</hi> which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
understood as if the Hair of his Head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

i. e. fifty Ounces, which is four Pounds and
two Ounces, if you reckon by the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>sser Shekel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but if you make your Computation by the Greater
one, which was double in weight, his Hair weighed
eight Pounds and four Ounces. But this cannot be,
for though his <hi>Hair was heavy,</hi> (as the Text testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies)
yet it is no ways credible that it was of this
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:46315:386"/>
vast Weight. Two hundred Shekels of the lesser
Weight are more ponderous than the Fleeces of
two ordinary Sheep. You may imagine then what
the Weight doubled will be, <hi>i. e.</hi> if you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the Place of the <hi>Greater Shekels.</hi> Wherefore
by <hi>Shekels</hi> here is meant <hi>Coin,</hi> and not <hi>Weight:</hi> the
Meaning is this, that <hi>Absalom</hi>'s Hair growing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively,
and being very heavy, he yearly cut it
off; and when it was weighed, it was found to be
worth two hundred Shekels, that is, according to
the Common Shekel, twelve Pounds ten Shillings
in our English Money, but much more according to
the rate of the Greater Shekel. The <hi>Price</hi> or <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi>
of his Hair, not the <hi>Weight</hi> of it, is here spoken
of. So much Money he could have had for the
yearly Loppings of his Hair, and so much and
more they made of it to whom he gave it, <hi>viz.</hi> his
Servants, who parted with it at a dear rate to the
Ladies of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who were ambitious of adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Heads with the Hair of the Beautiful <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salom,</hi>
with the Locks of the King's Son; especially
if what a<note n="*" place="bottom">

suggests hath any Truth in it, <hi>viz,</hi> that
he was a Temporary <hi>Nazarite,</hi> (as some among the
Jews were; yea, 'tis my Opinion that they were
all at their Liberty) and let his Hair grow from
Year to Year, because of his Vow: for then some
of the better disposed Females might in a Religious
way buy up these Reliques of <hi>Nazaritism,</hi> and look
upon them as Sacred. If this Interpretation of
the Place be not admitted, then one of these two
things must be granted, either that his Hair was of
that Prodigious and Incredible Weight which we
mentioned, (which will hardly be received) or
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46315:387"/>
else that we are mistaken in the true Value of a
Shekel in this Place; and if so, we may be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in others.</p>
                     <p>We might likewise consider the Value of a <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi>
which is either the <hi>Great</hi> or the <hi>Lesser:</hi> the
Value of the former is two hundred thirty three
Pounds Sterling; and of the latter one hundred se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
five Pounds Sterling, according to some good
Authors. But others will have four hundred Pound
Sterling to be the true Estimate of the Greater Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and they value the Lesser at half as much.
Again, the Scripture speaks of a <hi>Talent of Silver,</hi>
and a <hi>Talent of Gold,</hi> and these also are differently
understood; for some value the former at one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
eighty seven Pounds ten Shillings; others at
three hundred seventy five Pounds: the latter is
esteemed to be two thousand two hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by some; and four thousand five hundred by
others. In short, (as<note n="*" place="bottom">De Asse.</note>

<hi>Talents</hi> are according to the Use and Value of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Another Name attributed to the same Person

changed. In the New Testament also, the same

Again, both in the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
different Persons have sometimes the same
Name. Further, sometimes the same Name is given
to Persons of both Sexes. Moreover, one Name
served for all the successive Kings of a Country,
or at least for several of them. Lastly, the same
Places which we read of in Scripture have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Appellations, which sometimes causes Obscurity.
Or some Names of the same Place differ but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
i. e. as to a Letter or two.</p>

                     <p>IN the Prosecution of the foregoing Head, <hi>viz.
the Different acception of words</hi> used in Scripture,
I might here take notice that <hi>two or three Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Names</hi> are given to the same Person in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
places of Scripture, which hath occasion'd
no little difficulty in understanding some Texts.
But yet when we consider that this is a very usual
thing in the Sacred Writings, the Difficulty must
needs vanish. By comparing 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 27. with
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 2. we find that the same Daughter of
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:46315:390"/>
                        <hi>Absalom</hi> was named <hi>Tamar</hi> and <hi>Maacha.</hi> The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who is call'd <hi>Iozachar</hi> in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 21. is
named <hi>Zabad</hi> in 2 <hi>Chron. 24. 26. Azariah</hi> and
<hi>Vzziah</hi> are the Names of the same King of <hi>Iudah,
2 Kings 15. 1. Isa. 1. 1. 2 Kings</hi> 14. 21. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 1. The same King was
called <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and <hi>Mattaniah, 2 Kings</hi> 24. 17.
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 15. Thus <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> and <hi>Iechoniah</hi> are
the Names of the same King: which occasions that
difficulty in <hi>Mat. 1. 11. Iosias begat Iechonias;</hi> it
appearing from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 16. that <hi>Iosias</hi> begat
<hi>Iehoiakim.</hi> But if it were usual for the Kings and
others among the Jews to have a double Name,
then it is likely that <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> had so too, and
thus the Difficulty is salved: <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> was called
<hi>Iechoniah.</hi> It is true, there is another way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
this, by observing that in <hi>Christ's Genealogy</hi>
(Of which we shall speak afterwards) sometimes a
Person is said to <hi>beget</hi> another who is not properly
his <hi>Son,</hi> but one at a distance from him, his
Grand-child, or some of his Lineage farther off;
and so the words in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> may refer to a
<hi>Iechonias</hi> that was afterwards, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 16.
But from the places before mention'd, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
others which I shall produce afterwards, it
is evident that some of the Jewish Kings and Other
Persons besides them had two Names.</p>
                     <p>Which may give a Solution of that controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
place, <hi>Mat. 23. 35. That upon you may come
all the righteous Blood shed upon the Earth, from the
Blood of righteous</hi> Abel <hi>unto the Blood of</hi> Zacharias
<hi>Son of</hi> Barachias, <hi>whom ye slew between the Temple
and the Altar.</hi> Our Saviour without doubt here
refers to the Old Testament, but we find no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
mention there of <hi>Zacharias the Son of</hi> Bara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias<hi>'s being slain between the Temple and the Altar.</hi>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:46315:390"/>
Therefore some are of the opinion that the word
<hi>Zacharias</hi> is crept into the Text, but should not
be there. But this is an ill way of solving the
Difficulty, because after this rate we may expunge
what word we please out of the Bible, to make
good our own Interpretation of the Place. Others
think this <hi>Zacharias</hi> was the last but one of the
Twelve Prophets, who is expresly said to be <hi>the
Son of</hi> Barachias, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1. 1. But, 1. We read not
in Scripture or any other History that this Prophet
was slain by the Jews, and therefore there is no
ground to believe that it was He who is spoken of
here. 2. He could not be slain <hi>between the Temple
and the Altar,</hi> for at that time, <hi>viz.</hi> the Return of
the Jews from <hi>Babylon,</hi> neither the Temple nor
Altar were erected. Or 3. Suppose they were,
yet the Jews, so soon after their Captivity, were
not arrived to that height of Wickedness to put
their Prophets to Death. Again, <hi>Baronius</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to prove out of some of the Antients, that
this was <hi>Iohn the Baptist's Father,</hi> whose Name we
know was <hi>Zacharias,</hi> Luke 1. 59. and that he was
slain by <hi>Herod</hi> because he refused to deliver up his
Son the Baptist into his hands to be put to Death
by him. But first, though this be mention'd by
some Writers of old, yet we find them not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in attesting and confirming this Narrative;
because, without doubt, there was no Evidence of
it. Besides, as I suggested before, our Saviour
seems to refer to something recorded in the <hi>Old
Testament.</hi> Moreover, if <hi>Zacharias</hi> had been put
to Death by <hi>Herod,</hi> it is highly probable that the
<hi>Evangelical History</hi> would have taken particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it, and have related the Death of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as well as of the Son. Lastly, There is not
the least hint that this <hi>Zacharias</hi> was the <hi>Son of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:46315:391"/>
Barachias.</hi> Next, It is said by Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and
others, that Christ speaks here of <hi>Zacharias</hi> the
Son of <hi>Baruch,</hi> mention'd by<note n="*" place="bottom">De bel. Jud. l. 4. c. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who was
kill'd a little before the final Overthrow of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem:</hi>
For the Words of Christ relate not to
any one who had been slain already, but they are
a Prophecy concerning the last of all the Martyrs
of the Jews, who should be put to Death before
the Destruction of the last Temple, and the Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of that Nation. Such a <hi>Zachary,</hi> the <hi>Son of
Baruch,</hi> was kill'd in the middle of the Temple,
as the Jewish Historian assures us. But first it is
plain that Christ speaks of something that had
already happen'd, not of something that was to
come. It is not <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
not a future but an aorist, and so denotes what
hath been done before, not what shall be done
afterwards. Therefore Christ's words are to be
understood of one that had been in time past kill'd
by the Jews. Secondly, It is unquestionable that
Christ speaks of some very Holy Man, whose violent
Death is recorded in the <hi>Old Testament;</hi> for you
find this <hi>Zacharias</hi> joyn'd with <hi>Abel,</hi> of whom you
read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 8. and for that reason we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that this <hi>Baruch</hi> is not meant here. Thirdly,
It is doubtful whether the Blood of this Person
whom <hi>Iosephus</hi> speaks of, may be call'd <hi>righteous
Blood,</hi> as this is here: for it was upon a Civil Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that that <hi>Son of Baruch</hi> was put to Death, <hi>viz.</hi>
because he was thought to take part with the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and so he cannot be well parallell'd with
<hi>Abel.</hi>

that this <hi>Zacharias</hi> is he who is mentioned
in 2 <hi>Chron. 24. 20. And the Spirit of God came upon</hi>
Zechariah <hi>the Son of</hi> Jehoiada <hi>the Priest, who stood
above the People, and said unto them, Thus saith the
Lord, Why,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And they conspired against him, and
stoned him with stones at the Commandment of the
King, in the Court of the House of the Lord. Thus</hi>
Joash <hi>the King remembred not the Kindness which</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoiada
<hi>his Father had done to him, but slew his Son.</hi>
This is the Person whom our Saviour speaks of, and
the shedding of whose righteous Blood he impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to the Jews of that Age. <hi>Him ye slew,</hi> saith
he; for though 'tis said, <hi>the King slew him,</hi> because
he <hi>commanded</hi> him to be slain, yet 'tis said likewise,
<hi>the People slew him,</hi> because they not only <hi>conspired
against him</hi> (as you read) but actually <hi>stoned him.</hi>
And this they did <hi>in the Court of the House of the
Lord,</hi> which is the same with what our Saviour
saith, <hi>between the Temple and the Altar.</hi> And his
<hi>Blood</hi> may justly deserve the Epithet of <hi>Righteous,</hi>
and he may justly be reckon'd with <hi>Righteous Abel,</hi>
because he lost his Life in a <hi>Righteous Cause,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
with great Boldness and Zeal he reproved
the People for their Sins, but especially for their
Idolatry, and foretold them what Misery these
would certainly bring upon them. For this zealous
Freedom of his they took away his Life. This was
a very Eminent Man among the Jews: There are
in their Writings remarkable Stories concerning
him, not only relating to his Life, but his Death.
They kill'd him being both a Priest and a Prophet,
and before the Temple, and on the day of Expiation;
and from several other Circumstances his Murder

because it was common to have two Names

<hi>Iehoiada</hi> and <hi>Barachias,</hi> he is call'd in the <hi>Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
the <hi>Son of</hi> Jehoiada, and by our Saviour, <hi>the
Son of</hi> Barachias. But in this it is likely Christ
had reference to the words of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Chap. 8. 2.
[Zachariah <hi>the Son of</hi> Jereberechiah] or <hi>Barachiah,</hi>

                        </hi>
was his Father's Name, as our Christian Rabbi
makes it clear. Thus our Saviour's words are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled

to what I before observ'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is usual in
Scripture to affix two Names to the same Person:

other.</p>
                     <p>So that in <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 25, 26. may be understood,
<hi>Have ye never read what</hi> David <hi>did when he had need,

God in the days of</hi> Abiathar <hi>the High-Priest, and did
eat the Shew-bread?</hi> If you look into 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.
you will see that it was in the days of <hi>Ahimelech</hi>
the High-Priest: which <hi>Ahimelech,</hi> it seems, was
call'd also <hi>Abiathar,</hi> otherwise our Saviour would
not have used that Name. Which I will yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

2 Sam. 12. 25. <hi>Lemuel,</hi> Prov. 31. 1. <hi>Coheleth,</hi> Eccl. 1. 1.
which last is rendred <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> and <hi>Preacher;</hi> and
a great deal of dispute there is why <hi>Solomon</hi> is
call'd so, especially in the Feminine Gender: but
if we take it to be his <hi>Proper Name,</hi> then all Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
of that nature are at an end; for neither the
Derivation of the word, nor the Termination of
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:46315:393"/>
it are to be insisted upon. Nay, some think <hi>Agur</hi>
is a fourth Name given him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 1. from the
Participle <hi>agur, collectus, receptus;</hi> because he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd
himself after his Follies, and was receiv'd
into God's Favour. And some have thought he is
call'd in the same place <hi>the Son of</hi> Jakeh, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the
Obedient, to express further his Repentance and
Reformation.</p>
                     <p>Here it might be observ'd, that the <hi>Old Testament</hi>
gives one Name to Persons, and <hi>Profane Writers</hi>
another. He that is call'd <hi>Nimrod</hi> in the former,
is named <hi>Belus</hi> in the latter, it is likely. He that
is <hi>Assur</hi> in Scripture, is <hi>Ninus</hi> in Gentile History;
for<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 10. 11,</note> he built <hi>Nineve,</hi> which bears his Name. This
was the Chief Seat of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Empire, call'd
so from this <hi>Assur,</hi> Son of <hi>Shem.</hi> That Assyrian
King that is call'd <hi>Belochus</hi> in Profane Story, is
<hi>Pul</hi> in the Sacred one, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 19. And in
other Instances it might be shew'd that 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to have two Names, one in the Bible, the
other in Heathen Writers. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> is the same
with <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> Esth. 1. 1. according to the LXX's
Version, and <hi>Iosephus:</hi> but whether this be true or
no, 'tis certain that other Kings had different
Names among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans.</hi> In Pagan Authors
there is no mention of <hi>Salmanassar, Tiglath-Pileser,
Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar:</hi> The Greek and Latin
Historians have not the Names of these Assyrian
Kings, who are celebrated in Scripture: but it may
be they are represented under other Names in
those Writers; for the Names of Kings vary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Language of different Countries:
which occasions some disagreement between Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
and Sacred History.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="321" facs="tcp:46315:393"/>
Further, I add that sometimes in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
there is not properly another Name given
to the same Person, but only a Name a little Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
by the Alteration or Addition of some one
Letter or more; as that Great Captain who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
the Israelites into <hi>Canaan</hi> is call'd <hi>Iosua,
Iehosua,</hi> Numb. 13. 16. <hi>Oshea,</hi> or <hi>Hoshea,</hi> Deut.
32. 44. (besides that in the New Testament he is
called <hi>Iesus,</hi> Acts 7. 45. Heb. 4. 9.) <hi>Ahimelech,
2 Sam.</hi> 8. 17. (who is the same, as I said, with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biathar)</hi>
is called <hi>Abimelech,</hi> 1 Chron. 18. 10. <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphat,</hi>
1 Kings 15. 24. is <hi>Iosaphat,</hi> Matth. 1. 8.
<hi>Iehoram,</hi> 1 Kings 22. 50. is <hi>Ioram,</hi> Matth. 1. 8.

14. is <hi>Abishalom,</hi> 1 Kings 15. 1. <hi>Vzziah</hi> (who, as
you have heard, was the same with <hi>Azariah</hi>) is
call'd <hi>Vzzah,</hi> 2 Kings 21. 26. and <hi>Ozias,</hi> Matth.
1. 8. <hi>Iehoiachim,</hi> 2 Kings 23. 24. is (with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of one Letter only) <hi>Iehoiachin,</hi> 2 Kings 24.
8. <hi>Iechoniah</hi> in contempt is named <hi>Coniah,</hi> Jer. 22.

                     <p>If you look into the New Testament also, you'l
see that the same Persons have Different Names:
as he who was nominated for the Apostleship is
called <hi>Ioseph, Barsabas,</hi> and <hi>Iustus,</hi> Acts 1. 23.
And <hi>Ioses</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> are Names of the same A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>Acts</hi> 4. 36. Yea, all the rest of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
except <hi>Iohn,</hi> had more Names than one:
But sometimes the Name is only somewhat <hi>altered,</hi>
                        <pb n="322" facs="tcp:46315:394"/>
but can't be said to be another Name, as <hi>Simon</hi> and
<hi>Simeon,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 1. Acts 15. 14. <hi>Annas</hi> the High
Priest is call'd <hi>Ananias,</hi> Acts 23. 5. and is called

called <hi>Niger,</hi> a Teacher of the Christian Church at

                     <p>Of <hi>Women</hi> the same may be observed, <hi>viz.</hi> what
different Persons of that Sex have the same Name,

New Testament, and to distinguish them aright is
of very great Use. Besides Mary <hi>the Mother of</hi>

another <hi>Mary,</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> greets, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 6.
there are thought by some to be five more of that
Name, <hi>viz.</hi> the Blessed Virgin, the Mother of our
Lord: <hi>Mary</hi> the Sister of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
Luk 10. 39. Joh. 11. 1. <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> Mar. 15. 40.
<hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Ioses,</hi> Matth. 27. 56.

are the same: She had the former Denomination
from her Sons, and the latter from her Husband
<hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Cleophas.</hi> These three <hi>Maries</hi> are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
mention'd in <hi>Iohn 19. 25. There stood by the

<hi>the Wife of</hi> Cleophas, <hi>and</hi> Mary Magdalene.
In the rest of the<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. 27. 56. Mark 15. 40.</note> Evangelists we find at the same
place <hi>Mary Magdalene, and</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of</hi>
James <hi>and</hi> Joses: And again at the Sepulcher,
<note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. 27. 61.</note> Mary Magdalene <hi>and the other</hi> Mary. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
saith this Learned Writer, <hi>this other</hi> Mary,
by the Conjunction of these Testimonies, appears
to be <hi>Mary</hi> the Wife of <hi>Cleophas,</hi> and the Mother
of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Ioses:</hi> and thence he infers that
<hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Ioses</hi> who are said to be <hi>Christ's Brethren,</hi>
were not the Sons of <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, but of the
<hi>other Mary,</hi> and are call'd his <hi>Brethren,</hi> according
to the Language of the Jews, because the <hi>other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
was the Sister of Christ's Mother, she was our
Blessed Lord's Aunt on the Mother's side. And so
the right understanding of these Places where the
<hi>Maries</hi> are mentioned, may lead us to a true Notion
of <hi>Christ's Brethren</hi> spoken of in the Evangelists,
whereby we may know whether they were the
Children of <hi>Mary</hi> the Blessed Virgin by <hi>Ioseph,</hi> or
of the Virgin's Sister, or of some other Mother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin
to her, and therefore call'd the <hi>Brethren</hi> of
Christ, because they were his <hi>Kindred.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, I could observe that sometimes the same
Names in Scripture are given to Persons of both
Sexes, as among us <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> and some
other Names are common to both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46315:396"/>
Not to mention <hi>Gen. 5. 2. he call'd their
Name</hi> Adam, whence it is evident that <hi>Adam</hi> was
the Name of both our first Parents at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
though afterwards the Woman had another
Name given her by her Husband, and he took the
Name <hi>Adam</hi> as proper to himself, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 20.
There are other plainer Instances in <hi>Gen.</hi> 36. 2,
41. and in the same Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 40. and
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 36. where you will see that <hi>Aholibamah</hi>
was the Name both of a Man and of a Woman,
and so was <hi>Timna.</hi> I find that <hi>Noah</hi> is the Name
of a Woman, the Daughter of <hi>Zelophehad,</hi> Numb.
36. 11. but I confess the words differ in the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
one is <hi>Noach,</hi> the other <hi>Nognah. Iohn</hi> and
<hi>Ioanna,</hi> especially the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>,
(<hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 27.) are in a manner the same Name, but
belonging to different Sexes. And further, to let
you see how differently the same Names are bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I could observe that <hi>Michael</hi> is the Name both of
a <hi>Man,</hi> 1 Chron. 7. 3. and of an <hi>Angel, Dan.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, under this Head it might be more
material to observe that One Name served for
all the Successive Kings of a Country, or at least
for several of them. All Historians agree in the
Catalogue of the Kings of <hi>Persia,</hi> viz. <hi>Cyrus</hi> the
First, <hi>Cambyses</hi> the Second, <hi>Darius Hystaspis</hi> the
Third, <hi>Xerxes</hi> the Fourth, <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi>
the Fifth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet in the Book of <hi>Ezra</hi> we read,
that These five were successively, <hi>viz. Cyrus, Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suerus,
Artaxerxes, Darius, Artaxerxes.</hi> How is
this to be reconciled? Both by saying that the
same <hi>Persian</hi> Kings had different Names, and also
that several of them had one Name, which are
both very true. One of them was call'd <hi>Cambyses</hi>
and <hi>Ahasuerus,</hi> another had the Name <hi>Darius</hi> and
<hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> a third was call'd <hi>Xerxes</hi> and <hi>Darius.</hi>
                        <pb n="328" facs="tcp:46315:397"/>
And besides this, they were all call'd by one Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Name; that is, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was a common
Name of the whole Race of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings.

                        </note> Learnedst Jews were of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and it is the more probable, because this hath
been usual in other Kingdoms and Countries, as we
learn from the Sacred Records. There we find
that there was one Common Name for all the Kings
of <hi>Philistia</hi> or <hi>Palestine,</hi> and that was <hi>Abimelech,</hi> as
is clear from <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 2. Ch. 26. 1, 4. Ch. 34. 1.
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 11. and also from the Title of the <hi>34th</hi>
Psalm it appears that this was the Universal Name
of the Kings of the Philistines. So <hi>Agag</hi> was the
Common Title of all the Kings of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi>
as may be inferr'd from <hi>Numb. 24. 7. 1 Sam.</hi> 15. 8.
It is probable that <hi>Hiram</hi> was the Catholick Name
of the Kings of <hi>Tyre:</hi> but that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was so of
all the Egyptian Kings of old is undeniably clear
from <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 15. which speaks of a <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
time: from <hi>Gen. 39. 1, &amp;c.</hi> where we read
of another of that Name in <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s days. And in
<hi>Exodus</hi> there is frequent mention of that <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
that enslaved the Israelites and order'd all their
Male-Children to be drowned, and of <hi>another</hi> whose
Heart was hardned, and who was drown'd in the
Red Sea. There was a <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time,
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 1. and in <hi>Iosias</hi>'s, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. 29. In
<hi>Isaiah</hi> we read of a King of <hi>Egypt</hi> of this Name,
Ch. 19. 11. Ch. 30. 2, 3. So in <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> Ch. 25.
19. Ch. 44. 30. Ch. 46. 17. and in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> very
often. That this was the constant Title of the
Egyptian Kings is attested by <hi>Suidas, Eusebius,</hi> and
<hi>Iosephus:</hi> yea, if we may believe this<note n="†" place="bottom">Antiqu. l. 8. c. 6.</note> last, <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
in the Egyptian Tongue signifies a <hi>King.</hi> Which
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46315:397"/>
seems truly to be confirm'd from that passage in
<hi>Gen. 41. 44. I am Pharaoh,</hi> which is as much as to
say, I am King, I am Supreme Ruler, I will not
part with this Name, <hi>i. e.</hi> I will not lose my Royal
Dignity and Power. And accordingly he retain'd
this Name himself, and gave <hi>Ioseph</hi> another, as
you read in the next Verse. It might well then
be the General Name of their Kings, it signifying
Royal Authority and Rule. But after the time of
<hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, the Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
called <hi>Ptolomees:</hi> and after the renouncing of
the Greek Emperour they were a long time call'd
<hi>Caliphs:</hi> for the General of the Saracens, whom the
Egyptians took for their King, was named <hi>Caliph:</hi>
whence the succeeding Kings were denominated
after his Name. To proceed in this Subject, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus</hi>
was a Standing Title to all the Kings of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus,</hi>
though it is true some of them had a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
peculiar Name besides; whence that King
of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> who was thought to be the Inventer
of Parchment to write upon, is call'd <hi>Attalus</hi> by
<hi>Aelian</hi> and St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> but <hi>Eumenes</hi> by others. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus</hi>
was generally the Name of the Syrian Kings,
and <hi>Mithridates</hi> of those of <hi>Pontus.</hi> All the Kings
or Dynasts of <hi>Edessa</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> had the Name of
<hi>Abgarus. Herod</hi> was the Name common to all the
Successors of <hi>Herod</hi> the first; as we learn from the
<hi>Gospels</hi> and the <hi>Acts.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Communi nomine Candacae appellatae sunt. Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 6. c. 29.</note>

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46315:398"/>

as <hi>Sophi</hi> of late: and <hi>Sultan</hi> is the distinguishing
Title of the Turkish Empire: and <hi>Miramolin</hi> or
<hi>Miramomolin</hi> of all the Princes of <hi>Mauritania.</hi>
Thus briefly I have shew'd, that it was usual for
all the Kings of a Country to have the same Name,
for a very considerable time at least. The obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of which may be of some use to us in reading
the Sacred History, when it refers to any of those
Kings whom I first named, and in reading Profane
Authors who mention any of the others.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, I could observe concerning <hi>Places</hi> in
Scripture, the same that I have concerning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<hi>viz.</hi> that sometimes they have <hi>different Names,</hi>
which we ought carefully to heed in reading this
Holy Book. One eminent Mountain in <hi>Palestine</hi>
and the adjacent Parts, hath several Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
it is call'd <hi>Zion,</hi> Psal. 2. 6. and frequently
in other Books of the Old Testament. It is also
named <hi>Moriah,</hi> 2 Chron. 3. 1. the same Mount
where <hi>Moses</hi> saw the Burning Bush not consumed,
and where <hi>Isaac</hi> was offer'd, and where the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
afterwards was built. This Name was so cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
that from this the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is call'd
<hi>the Land of</hi> Moriah, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 2. The same Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
is named <hi>Hermon,</hi> as is evident from those
express words, <hi>Deut. 4. 48. Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>which is
Hermon.</hi> It is also call'd <hi>Sirion,</hi> Deut. 3. 9. which
Name was given it by the Sidonians. And in the
same place it hath the Name of <hi>Shenir,</hi> which was
given it by the Amorites. This Multiplicity of
Names may, I conceive, be grounded on this, that
<hi>Sion</hi> or <hi>Hermon</hi> (or call it by any of the other
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:46315:398"/>
Names) is, properly speaking, a long Ledg of
several Hills that go through <hi>Palestine</hi> and a great
part of <hi>Arabia.</hi> Some add <hi>Gilead</hi> and <hi>Seir,</hi> and
<hi>Lebanon</hi> (the famous <hi>Alpes</hi> of the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> upon
the North and East part of it, noted for its snowy
tops, its lofty Cedars and other Trees, and its fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant
Herbs and Plants.) Some, I say, add these
to the foregoing ones, and rightly determine that
they were but one continued Mountain with divers
Names: as Mount <hi>Taurus</hi> (though far greater) is
a ridg of Hills that hath several Names accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the different Parts of it. Hence <hi>Psal.</hi> 133. 3.
and some other places of Scripture mention some
of those Names before spoken of, as if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to different Mountains: and the reason is,
because though they are the same Mountain, yet
those Names refer to the different parts of the
same great ridg of Hills, and so are accounted as
it were different Hills: and accordingly the great
Mass of <hi>Dew</hi> which was in part distill'd on Mount
<hi>Hermon</hi> (one division of that great Mountain) did
partly also fall on Mount <hi>Zion</hi> (a neighbouring
part of the same Mountain:) which I take to be
the true and genuine meaning of those words of
the Psalmist, which have exercised the Brains of
so many Interpreters, <hi>As the Dew of</hi> Hermon <hi>that
descended</hi> (as it is according to the Hebrew; or as
we translate it, <hi>As the Dew of</hi> Hermon, <hi>and as the
Dew that descended) upon the Mountains of</hi> Zion:
both which Translations are reconcil'd by this
Exposition, and the Sense is rendred entire and
perfect. The Dew which descended on both these
places was the same, for some of it fell on this
part of the whole Mountain, and some on that;
so that successively <hi>Hermon</hi> and <hi>Zion</hi> were partakers
of this Blessing. Part of that Fructifying Moisture
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:46315:399"/>
which came down upon the one, soon after came
down upon the other.</p>
                     <p>In the Desarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> the Mountain whence
God gave the Law to <hi>Moses</hi> is call'd <hi>Sinai,</hi> Exod.
19. 18. and in other places: yet in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 10.
and elsewhere, frequently <hi>Horeb</hi> is the Name of the
same Mountain. Though St. <hi>Ierom</hi> is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Opinion, and thinks they are two distinct
Mountains, or at least two ridges of one Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
The like may be said of Mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> the
Arabian <hi>Parnassus,</hi> which had two Tops, <hi>Pisgah</hi>
and <hi>Hor:</hi> and by these Names as well as by the other
it was call'd, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. 23, 25. Ch. 27. 12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 1.
and it was named also Mount <hi>Abarim,</hi> Deut. 32. 49.
<hi>Numb.</hi> 27. 12. It may not be improbable that <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
and <hi>Moses</hi> died on the same Mount, though
they are represented under different Names. But
it is most apparent that a double or treble Name
is given to several other places: thus <hi>the Salt-Sea,</hi>
Gen. 14. 3. Numb. 34. 3. <hi>the Sea of the Desart,</hi> Deut.
3. 19. and <hi>the Sea of the Plain,</hi> Deut. 4. 49. signify
one and the same place, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sea of <hi>Sodom,</hi>
which is call'd by others the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> the Lake
<hi>Asphaltites,</hi> which was caused by the Destruction of

11. of <hi>Genesareth,</hi> Luke 5. 1. of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> John 21. 1.
of <hi>Galilee,</hi> John 6. 1. are but one Lake. Who
doubts that <hi>Assyria, Chaldea,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
promiscuously used for the same Region, and
that <hi>Mesopotamia; Charan, Padan-Aram</hi> are one
Country? So <hi>Galilee</hi> and <hi>Decapolis</hi> are the same: so
are <hi>Sichem</hi> and <hi>Sychar,</hi> Gen. 33. 18. John 4. 5.
And the like is to be said of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Sihor,</hi>
Isa. 23. 3. Thus Places have more Names than
one in the Holy Writings: which we ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to attend to, lest we run into Mistakes, as
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46315:399"/>
some have done by this Diversity of Names given to
the same Place. And this Difference of Names
might be observed in other Instances, which are
frequent in Gentile Writers, as <hi>Sparta</hi> and <hi>Lacedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Troy</hi> and <hi>Ilium, Thra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And this likewise is to be noted, that some
Names of the same Place differ but a little, <hi>i. e.</hi> as
to a Letter or two, and no more, as <hi>Haran,</hi> Gen.
12. 5. and <hi>Charran,</hi> Acts 7. 2. are the same: so
are <hi>Sechem, Shechem,</hi> and <hi>Sychem,</hi> Gen. 33. 18. Josh.
20. 7. Acts 7. 16. The same is to be said of <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loah,</hi>
Isa. 8. 6. <hi>Siloah,</hi> Neh. 3. 15. <hi>Siloam,</hi> John 9. 7.
Luk. 13. 4. all three the same: as <hi>Kidron,</hi> 2 Sam.
15. 23. and <hi>Cedron,</hi> John 18. 1. are the same Brook.
So <hi>Zarephath,</hi> 1 Kings 17. 9. and <hi>Sarepta,</hi> Luk. 4. 26.
are the same Town: <hi>Megiddo,</hi> 2 Kings 9. 27. and
<hi>Megiddon,</hi> Zech. 12. 11. the same Valley: <hi>Zin,</hi>
Numb. 13. 21. Deut. 32. 51. and <hi>Sin,</hi> Exod. 16. 1.
Numb. 33. 12. the same Wilderness: (though <hi>some</hi>
have thought these two latter words denote diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
places.) Concerning some things mention'd in
Scripture we should distinguish between them,
though they differ not much in Writing and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation,
especially when they are of the same
Species, as <hi>Sardine,</hi> Rev. 4. 3. <hi>Sardius,</hi> the same
precious Stone, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 20. but <hi>Sardonix</hi> is a Stone
different from that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 20. Though some
Names differ a little, yet they signify the same
thing, as <hi>Sycamine,</hi> Luk. 17. 6. and <hi>Sycamore,</hi> Ch. 19. 4.
But these are small things, and in which there is no
great danger if there should be any mistake, and
therefore I will not entertain you any longer with
these, but hasten to more important Matter. But
having spoken so largely of this First Head, I will
be brief in that which followeth.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>There are Words in the Hebrew Text which have not
only Different but Contrary Significations: which
is another cause of some Difficulty in Scripture. This
exemplified in several Hebrew Nouns, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
Tsagnir, Mic. 5. 2. which signifies both little
and great, and accordingly this place is reconciled
with Matth. 2. 6. Likewise Hebrew Verbs bear a
Contrary Sense, of which sundry Instances are given.
More particularly, the true import of the Verb Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak,
Iob 2. 9. is narrowly search'd into, and the
Author's particular Sense concerning that Text is
propounded and defended. Some Greek words in the
New Testament signify Contrary things. And the
like Discrepancy is observ'd in some words in other
Greek Authors, and in some among the Latins.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Proceed in the second place to observe, That
there are words in the Hebrew Text which
have not only <hi>Different</hi> but <hi>Contrary</hi> Significations,
which cannot but render some parts of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<hi>difficult.</hi> That is, they will be so till we have
throughly examin'd the words, and found out the
peculiar Signification which they have in the Texts
that are before us. Thus <hi>Shethum</hi> is rendred <hi>open,</hi>
as in <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 3. [<hi>the Man whose Eyes are open:</hi>]
and yet this Hebrew word signifies in all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture (where it is) <hi>shutting</hi> of the Eyes.
<hi>Chesed</hi> denotes <hi>Beneficence, Goodness, Piety,</hi> and the
height of them, and also <hi>Cruelty, Malice,</hi> and all
Excess of Evil, and whatever is Reproachful and
Ignominious in the Life of Man: thence<note n="*" place="bottom">R. Levi, Mercerus, Cocceius.</note> some
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:46315:400"/>
render those words <hi>Vechesed leummim chattah,</hi> Prov.
14. 34. <hi>The Piety of Nations is Sin,</hi> because whilst
they worship Idols they think they serve God;
and others understand the place according to our
Translation, <hi>Sin is the Reproach of any People:</hi> which
is much to be preferr'd before the other Version,
because it exactly answers to the former Clause.
The word <hi>Cherem</hi> is both that which is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
to God, and that which is Accursed and
devoted to the Devil, as I have shew'd in another
place. An impure Catamite, a Sodomite is call'd
<hi>Kadesh,</hi> from <hi>Kadash, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>acer fuit:</hi> and <hi>Kedeshah,</hi> which
is no other than <hi>Sanctificata,</hi> is taken for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prostitute. The word <hi>Tsagnir</hi> is both <hi>little</hi>
and <hi>great,</hi> and accordingly <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. 2. may be
rendred either <hi>Thou</hi> Bethlehem Ephratah, <hi>thou art
little, or art great among the thousands of</hi> Judah.
The not attending to this, hath occasion'd no small
trouble among Expositors, whilst they labour to
reconcile this Text with <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 6. where it is
quoted by the Jewish Doctors and Priests, and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi>
is said to be <hi>not the least.</hi> But the Learned
Dr. <hi>Pocock<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> on the place saith, that he had it from
a very Understanding Jew, that the Hebrew word
<hi>Tsagnir</hi> signifies both <hi>little</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> and others
that have good Skill in that Tongue assert the same.
It is to be understood in this place in the latter
Sense, and so the words ought to be rendred thus,
<hi>Thou</hi> Bethlehem Ephratah, <hi>thou art great among
the Thousands</hi> (or among the <hi>Princes) of</hi> Judah;
for the Principalities were divided into Chiliads
or Thousands, <hi>Iudg. 6. 15. 1 Sam.</hi> 10. 19. Thus
the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> and the Evangelist <hi>Matthew</hi>
agree, for <hi>great</hi> and <hi>not the least</hi> are here the same.
And certainly it is a far better way of reconciling
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:46315:401"/>
them, than that which a<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Sir</hi> Norton Knatchbull<hi>'s Annotations on St.</hi> Matthew.</note> Late Writer propounds,
<hi>viz.</hi> That whereas we read it <hi>Tsagnir,</hi> it should be
read <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>progredere,</hi> go forth: for (besides that
this somewhat marr's the Sense of the place) if we
go this way to work, we may alter a great many
places in the Old Testament, and in the New too,
and substitute one word for another when we
please, and so we shall lose a great part of the
Bible in a short time: this therefore is not to
be allow'd of by any means. There are other
Nouns of a <hi>Contrary Signification,</hi> as <hi>Terugnah,</hi>
which is both a <hi>Ioyful Shout,</hi> Psal. 33. 3. and a
<hi>Mournful Cry,</hi> Jer. 20. 16. <hi>Chesel</hi> is not only In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy
or Levity, but Constancy or Stedfastness
and Confidence. And there is a very great Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepancy,
if not Contrariety in the rendrings of
the word <hi>Deshen,</hi> which is sometimes <hi>Ashes</hi> and
sometimes <hi>Fatness.</hi> But if we be mindful of the
Subject Matter spoken of, we can't miss of the true
Sense.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Verbs</hi> which bear a <hi>Contrary Sense,</hi> are
most remarkable: thus <hi>Sakal</hi> is <hi>lapidare, lapidibus
obruere,</hi> commonly: also <hi>elapidare, lapides amovere,</hi>
Isa. 62. 10. <hi>Chasar</hi> is <hi>consecrari,</hi> Psal. 18. 26. and
<hi>execrari,</hi> Prov. 25. 10. <hi>Salah</hi> is <hi>aestimare,</hi> Job 28.
16, 19. and <hi>spernere, conculcare,</hi> Psal. 119. 118. <hi>Shub</hi>
is <hi>reducere, convertere;</hi> and <hi>avertere, rebellare:</hi> both
Senses are common in Scripture. <hi>Iaphang</hi> is <hi>to be
bright and shining:</hi> yet it may seem to be taken in
a contrary Signification, in <hi>Iob</hi> 10. 22. according
to <hi>Pagnin</hi>'s Translation, <hi>tenebrescit sicut caligo,</hi> and
the Vulgar Latin favours it. <hi>Tamam</hi> or <hi>tam,</hi> hath
a contrary Sense, for it signifies <hi>to perfect or finish,</hi>
                        <pb n="337" facs="tcp:46315:401"/>
as in <hi>Dan. 9. 24. to finish the Vision:</hi> and also <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,</hi>
as in <hi>Ezek. 22. 15. I will consume thy Filthiness
out of thee. Kadash,</hi> in the usual Import of it, is
<hi>to sanctify,</hi> but it is used in a quite opposite Sense
in <hi>Deut. 22. 9. lest the Fruit of thy Vineyard be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</hi>
So for other Verbs, it is common to find
them in Contrary Meanings; as <hi>Iarash,</hi> to <hi>possess</hi>
or <hi>inherit,</hi> commonly in Scripture; and to <hi>dispossess</hi>
or <hi>disinherit,</hi> to expel, reject and impoverish, <hi>Gen.</hi>
45. 11. and in other Places; both which contrary
Senses occur together in <hi>Iosh. 23. 5. He shall expel
them from before you, and ye shall possess their Land.
Expelling</hi> and <hi>Possessing</hi> are the same Hebrew Verb;
though in different Conjugations. So <hi>Chata</hi> in <hi>Kal</hi>
is <hi>to sin,</hi> but in <hi>Piel</hi> to <hi>expiate</hi> or <hi>take away Sin.</hi>
There is no other way to know the proper Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings
of these and other Words before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but by a diligent attending to the Scope and
Design of the Texts where they are. And thus we
shall perceive which of the Senses is designed,
though sometimes this is done with some Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
I will make choice of a Text to enlarge upon
to this purpose. The Instances are very usual in
Scripture.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Barak</hi> signifies both to <hi>bless</hi> and to <hi>curse,</hi> and in
some Places it may seem not very easy to tell which
of these is intended, as in those Words of <hi>Iob</hi>'s
Wife, <hi>Iob</hi> 2. 9. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which the Vulgar
Latin renders <hi>benedic Deo, bless God. Arias Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi>
and <hi>Munster</hi> follow this Version, and so doth
the Learned and Pious Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he renders the Verse thus, <hi>Dost thou still retain
thine Integrity? bless God, and die;</hi> and makes this
to be the Sense of it, <q>Thou being now sorely
afflicted by God, and brought even to Death's
Door, begin now at length to cast away thy
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:46315:402"/>
Conceitedness of thy own Righteousness, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
God's Hand upon thee for thy Sins,
confess those Sins before him, pray for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of them, and so end thy Days. This was
good Counsel, (saith this Worthy Person) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the applying of it was mix'd with Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
and Folly; and therefore <hi>Iob</hi> told his Wife,
that <hi>she spoke like one of the foolish Women.</hi>
                        </q> But
the <hi>Septuagint</hi> seem to take the Words in Another
and Contrary Sense, and render [<hi>Barek Elohim</hi>] by
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>speak some Word,</hi> or <hi>say
something against the Lord,</hi> (for the Praeposition <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
may signify so) which approacheth towards Our
Translation, <hi>Curse God:</hi> As if <hi>Iob</hi>'s Wife had said
to her Husband, Thou hast no reason to speak well
of God, thou hast been undeservedly tormented by
him; thou hast been an upright and righteous Man,
and yet none hath met with such Calamities and
Plagues as thou hast done; therefore my Advice to
thee is, that thou wouldst even curse and blaspheme
God himself, and then make an end of thy misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Life, by laying violent Hands on thy self. In
this Sense the word <hi>Barak</hi> is thought generally to
be taken in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 13. Naboth <hi>did blaspheme
God,</hi> though even there the Greek Interpreters

the Word sometimes by an Antiphrasis. Thus as
the<note n="†" place="bottom">Jam. 3. 9.</note> Apostle saith, <hi>with the same Tongue, with the
same Mouth,</hi> so with the same Word <hi>we both bless
and curse:</hi> for the same Word both in Hebrew and
Greek is used sometimes for both. But it is my
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46315:402"/>
Opinion that the Word in the former Place need
not be rendred either <hi>bless</hi> or <hi>curse,</hi> but that there is
a <hi>middle</hi> Signification of it there. That we may
apprehend this the better, we must know what the
first and original Sense of the Verb <hi>Barak</hi> is, which
I perceive few have enquired into. It appears
from the best Hebrew Grammarians and Lexico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers
that I have met with, that this Word pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitively
signifies <hi>to salute,</hi> or <hi>greet;</hi> in which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
Sense it is used twice in 2 <hi>Kings 4. 29. If thou
meet any Man, salute him not: and if any salute
thee, answer him not again.</hi> The Hebrew Word
which we translate <hi>salute,</hi> is <hi>Barak.</hi> So in <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.
7. 10. this Word is used to express <hi>Iacob</hi>'s solemn
<hi>Saluting</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at his coming before him, and
at his going out of his Presence: <hi>Iacob saluted</hi> (we
render it <hi>blessed) Pharaoh.</hi> But because <hi>Kneeling</hi>
was a Posture of <hi>Salutation, Barak</hi> signifies also <hi>to
kneel,</hi> or to salute one with bowing the Knee. And
thence <hi>Berek</hi> a <hi>Knee,</hi> and thence some have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
the word <hi>Abrek</hi> comes, which we read was
proclaim'd before <hi>Ioseph</hi> when he rid forth in State,
signifying (as they think) that the People ought to
<hi>salute</hi> him most humbly, and even to <hi>bow the Knee</hi> to
him. This is certain that<note n="*" place="bottom">Significat vel genu vel sermonem flectere ad aliquem. allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui cum geniculatione. Forster. Heb. Dict.</note> 
                        <hi>Barak</hi> is a general
Word for <hi>Saluting</hi> (whether at meeting or part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
either by Word or Gesture, and is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
with the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
at such times they generally used to <hi>bow the
Knee,</hi> it hath that particular Signification; as in
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, according
to the LXX. So in <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.
And in <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 11. the <hi>Kneeling down</hi> of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46315:403"/>
to take up their Burden is expressed by it.
Yea, the word <hi>Barak</hi> is sometimes transferr'd from
its signification of Civil Respect and Kneeling, and
applied unto Religious Worship, as in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.
13. <hi>Solomon</hi> (when he pray'd) <hi>kneeled upon his
Knees,</hi> &amp;c. And in <hi>Psal. 95. 6. Let us kneel before
the Lord our Maker.</hi> The Word is here made use
of to denote bending the Knee in Divine Worship,
and prostrating themselves before God. So that
this word <hi>Barak</hi> in the Original Denotation of it
answers to the word <hi>Nashak,</hi> which signifies <hi>to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in a lowly and humble manner,</hi> to submit and do
Obeisance: and more particularly <hi>Kissing</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
by it, which was a Token of Homage and
Subjection of old, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1. But from this
first and simple Import of the Word another ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
which is this, <hi>viz. to take leave of one,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Salutations</hi> and <hi>Greetings</hi> at last end in this.
Men part and go their way after a short saluting
and accosting one another. Thus the Word is
taken in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 22. Joab <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ell to the Ground on his
Face, and bowed himself, and thanked the King:</hi> Hebr.
Jeberek, <hi>he took his leave of him;</hi> he made that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation
which was becoming at his going out of his
Presence. In which Notion it likewise answers to
<hi>Nashak,</hi> which (besides its former Sense) signifies
<hi>to take leave of, to bid adieu to one,</hi> as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 28.
therefore that Valedictory Salutation of Kissing
was call'd <hi>Neshikah Parashah, osculum separationis,</hi>
the Kiss at parting or taking their leave of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And then there is another derivative Sense
of the Word, which flows both from this and the
former meaning of it, and that is twofold; for
Persons are wont at Saluting and taking Leave, to
<hi>wish well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> to one another, and to express these
by good or evil Words; whence it is that <hi>Barak</hi> is
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46315:403"/>
either <hi>benè</hi> or <hi>malè precari,</hi> it imports either to <hi>bless</hi>
or to <hi>curse.</hi> This, as I take it, is the true and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Account of the Word: and so you see what is
the primary and more restrain'd Acception of it,
and what is the secondary and more general Sense
of it. Now that which I offer is this, that the
Word in that Place of <hi>Iob</hi> is to be understood
chiefly in the first and most proper Denotations of
it, <hi>i. e.</hi> as it signifies <hi>humbly to salute, to bow down
and do Obeisance:</hi> or, as it signifies, <hi>to take one's
leave.</hi> According to the former Acception of the
Word <hi>Iob</hi>'s Wife speaks thus to him, Do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<hi>to retain thine Integrity,</hi> or <hi>to hold fast thy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
(as it is in the Original) Do not justify thy
self before God, as if thou wert void of all Guilt,
but with humble Reverence bow thy self before the
Lord, adore and worship the most High, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
thy self to him, and acknowledg thy Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

incur the Imputation of <hi>speaking foolishly,</hi> because
she (like <hi>Iob</hi>'s <hi>Friends</hi> afterwards) had wrong Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of this Good Man, and imagined that
he justified himself, and was in his own Thoughts
a Sinless Person. Or else this was the Worser Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of that Woman, <hi>Take now thy leave of God,

to the Crown of thy Head, (ver. 7.)</hi> think not of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
but rather desire to quit this World, and to
be gone: Bid God adieu, take your Farewel of
him, and only beg this of him, that you may die
as soon as may be. Or, you may suppose this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Language, or Meaning rather, to be much

Though this be not so harsh as downright <hi>Cursing</hi>
of God, yet this was indeed <hi>speaking like one of the
foolish</hi> sottish <hi>Women,</hi> as he roundly told her, <hi>v.</hi>
10. The Stile was something too rough to say, <hi>Curse
God.</hi> She would not speak after that rate to her
Pious Confort; but she impiously counsels him to
<hi>take his Leave</hi> of God and Religion, and to bid an
eternal Farewel to both. In three other Places in
this Book the Word is taken in this latter Sense,
(for it is most probable that in this particular Book
the Word is always used in the same Meaning) as
in <hi>ch. 1. 5. It may be my Sons have as 'twere taken
their leave of (i. e.</hi> tacitely renounced) <hi>God in their
Hearts,</hi> in the midst of their Pleasures and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments:
it may be they have had an <hi>Aversion</hi> to
God, they have in some measure <hi>departed from</hi> him:
for it is not likely that <hi>Iob</hi>'s Children openly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemed,
or (strictly speaking) <hi>cursed God.</hi> So
that part of the <hi>11th</hi> Verse of this Chapter, and
of the <hi>5th</hi> of the next, which we translate, <hi>he will
curse thee to thy Face,</hi> seems to be too harsh a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation (even from the Mouth of the Devil) of
that Holy Man's Carriage; for though he cursed
the Day of his Birth, he never curs'd and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Almighty, and that <hi>to his Face, i. e.</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and audaciously: but he might be said in some
Degree to have <hi>forsaken</hi> and <hi>abandoned God,</hi> and <hi>to
have turned himself from him,</hi> by indulging too much
to Impatience and Murmuring. And not only
these Places in <hi>Iob,</hi> but that in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
which we translate thus, Naboth <hi>blasphemed
or cursed God and the King,</hi> may be understood in
this Sense. He by certain Actions discovered (as
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:46315:404"/>
was pretended) that he had <hi>forsaken God,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
from his Duty to the King.</hi> But I submit this
to the Judgment of the Learned. Thus you see
that Words of <hi>Different,</hi> much more of <hi>Contrary
Significations,</hi> occasion some Difficulty in interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Texts where they are found. There are
many<note n="*" place="bottom">See in the End of the Book.</note> Other <hi>Hebrew</hi> Words in Scripture which

                     <argument>
                        <p>Some Difficulties in Scripture arise from the Matter or
Manner of things delivered, wherein prejudiced
Minds fancy some Repugnancy or Contradiction.
The Cavils against Gen. 4. 14. largely and fully
answered. Numb. 14. 30. reconciled with Josh. 14.
1. ch. 22. 13. The seeming Repugnancy of 1 Sam.
16. 22, 23, to chap. 17. ver. 55. removed. The
Geometrical Scruple about the brazen Laver,
2 Chron. 4. 2. dispell'd. Another Objection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it founded on 1 Kings 7. 26. compared with
1 Chron. 4. 5. answered. The Contradiction which
some fancy in 2 Chron. 14. 5. compared with
1 Kings 15. 14. taken away. A satisfactory Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to the Cavil against Matth. 27. 9. The double
Repugnancy conceived by some to be in Acts 7. 15.
plainly solv'd. John 5. 31. considered with ch. 8.
ver. 14. shew'd to be void of Contradiction. The
same proved concerning our Saviour's Words in
Matth. 10. 34. Heb. 9. 4. is not contrary to
1 Kings 8. 9.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the third Place I will shew, that not only from
the <hi>Different and Contrary Significations of Words,</hi>
but from <hi>Other Causes, viz.</hi> relating to the <hi>Matter
it self,</hi> or the <hi>Manner</hi> of what is spoken of, or the
<hi>Reference</hi> of one Text to another, or the <hi>Duration
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:46315:406"/>
of Time,</hi> or some other Circumstances, the <hi>Stile</hi> of
Scripture becomes Dark and Perplexed. Here I
will produce some particular Scripture-Difficulties
which arise on these Accounts; and I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to resolve them. First, There seem to be in
the very <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of things deliver'd
in Scripture (for I will promiscuously speak of them
both) very great Absurdities, Repugnances, and
Contradictions. <hi>There seem,</hi> I say, <hi>i. e.</hi> to prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and vitiated Minds there appear to be such; but
no Man of deliberate Thoughts and an honest
Heart will look upon them as so. I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
them so much as to insist long upon them,
but a few I will mention, that they and the rest
may not be thought Insuperable Difficulties. I will
begin with <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 14. which I find alledged by
some as a great Blemish in Scripture, <hi>It shall come
to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me.</hi>
I begin, I say, with this Passage of Holy Writ,
not because it is really Difficult, but because it is
represented such by some ill-minded Men, who
thereby think to invalidate the Truth of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
History. Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> and others of the same
temper, have taken notice of such Passages as these
in the Bible, and endeavour by the exposing of
them to diminish the Authority of the Scriptures,
and at the same time to shake the Credit of the
whole Body of the Inspired Writings. For thus
they vent their Cavils against that place, <q>How
could <hi>Cain</hi> say, that <hi>Every one</hi> who found him
would slay him when there was nobody at that
time in the World but his Father and Mother,
and his Wife? Had the World been peopled,
then indeed the guilty Man (if we may call him
so) might have had occasion to fear that some
body would seek to revenge the Death of <hi>Abel.</hi>
                           <pb n="347" facs="tcp:46315:406"/>
But there could be no ground of Fear when
the World was so empty as we read it was:
wherefore these words of <hi>Cain</hi> contradict the
plain History of <hi>Moses.</hi> When he saith, <hi>Every
one that finds me,</hi> &amp;c. it is implied that there
were a great many at that time in the World,
which disagrees with what the same History
delivers, <hi>viz.</hi> That there were no more than
<hi>Adam</hi> and his Wife, and their Son <hi>Cain</hi> and his
Wife then extant.</q> To which I answer,</p>
                     <p>1. It is with too much Confidence averr'd by
these Objectors, that there were but four Persons
at that time in being. For this is a thing which
they can never prove: and the reason is, because
<hi>Adam</hi> might have more Children than <hi>Cain</hi> and
his Wife, though they are not mention'd; and
these Children might have Sons and daughters:
So that it is not improbable that Mankind was then
consider<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bly increas'd. He knows nothing of the
Stile of Scripture who knows not this, that some
things are <hi>supposed,</hi> others are <hi>touched upon only,</hi> and
there are others that are <hi>fully set down,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
repeated. I am now speaking of the first
sort of things: we must necessarily suppose them
to be done, though there be no mention of them
at all. A great many things (and those very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rable)
as the Creation of Angels, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
enter'd into between God and our First Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
the celebrating of the Seventh Day, the
instituting of Sacrifices, and such like are omitted
in the Book of <hi>Genesis.</hi> And when you observe
that <hi>Moses</hi> in the six first Chapters of this Book
(and those but brief ones) compriseth the History
of the World from the Creation to the Flood, <hi>i. e.</hi>
the Transactions of Sixteen hundred Years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
you cannot but acknowledg that a vast num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:46315:407"/>
of Passages which happen'd in that time are
wholly left out. This in part we may gather
from the Writings of the New Testament, where
some particular things are mentioned that refer
to the Affairs of the Old Testament, but we find
them not named there. As <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Last Judgment is spoken of by St. <hi>Iude,
ver.</hi> 14. but there's not a word of it in that place
of <hi>Genesis</hi> which speaks of him. The particular
Persons that <hi>withstood Moses,</hi> viz. <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,</hi>
are mention'd in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 8. but their Names
are not set down in <hi>Exodus,</hi> which was the proper
place for them. The famous Contrast of the
Good and Evil Angels <hi>about the Body of</hi> Moses, <hi>i. e.</hi>
the burying of it, is recorded by St. <hi>Iude,</hi> ver. 9.
but there is not a word of it in <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. where
there is particular mention of his <hi>burying,</hi> ver. 6.
Whence it appears, that many things were done
in those times concerning which <hi>Moses</hi> wrote (or
Whosoever it was that made a Supplement to his
Writings) which are not recorded. Nor are we
to find fault with the Sacred History for this, for
if it be part of the Work of an <hi>Historian</hi> (as one
who was such acquaints us)<note n="*" place="bottom">Dionys. Halicarn.</note> 
                        <hi>to know what things
are to be committed to History, and what things are
to be past in silence, to know from whence to take his
beginning, and how far he is to go,</hi> certainly <hi>Moses,</hi> who
was skill'd in all other Learning as well as that
of the Egyptians, and who moreover was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Person, knew what belong'd to this part of
an Historian, inserted into the Pentateuch those
things only which the Holy Spirit thought fit to
be committed to writing, and the rest (which
were exceeding numerous) were passed by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:46315:407"/>
though they were so, yet we have no reason wholly
to disbelieve them, but where they are fairly <hi>inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated</hi>
or <hi>supposed</hi> in the Sacred History, we ought
to credit them as if they were <hi>particularly</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly</hi>
mention'd. Thus, in the present case, though
'tis not expresly recorded in the Fourth Chapter
of <hi>Genesis,</hi> that there were any more Persons at
that time on the Earth than those four, yet it is
reasonable to think that there was a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
because we know that the History of <hi>Moses</hi>
is very short and contracted, and is wont to leave
out several considerable things, which we of our
selves may gather and infer from what is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
terms set down. There might then be, and
it is most probable that there were more People
in the world at that time than those whose Names
we meet with. <hi>Moses</hi> gives us but two Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
one of <hi>Cain,</hi> the other of <hi>Seth,</hi> but it is likely
there were some other Descents, whereby <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Race was increas'd and multiplied. Wherefore
notwithstanding the samll number of Persons na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by this Writer, it is rational to believe that
there were many more living on the Earth. We
read presently after, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. that <hi>Cain built a
City,</hi> which would employ a considerable number
of Men; yea, though we suppose it to consist of
some rude and slight Structures, and wall'd perhaps
with Mud. This makes it probable that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Persons was greater than the Objectors ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
Besides, <hi>Cain</hi> and his Wife there might be
many other Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam;</hi> and
there might be many Sons of <hi>Abel,</hi> who this
Murderer might justly fear would avenge their
Father's Blood. Wherefore <hi>Cain</hi> had reason to
say, <hi>Every one that finds me shall slay me.</hi>

                        </gap>re were
Examples of it, though not in his own kind; for
'tis likely he daily beheld his Father <hi>Adam</hi> slaying
of Sheep or other Animals, in order to the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
of them, (for Sacrificing was the first Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46315:408"/>
in the World) and he saw his Brother <hi>Abel</hi>
do the like, as is expresly recorded in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
where 'tis said, that <hi>he offer'd the Firstlings of
his Flock, and of the fat thereof,</hi> ver. 4. which he
could not do without <hi>killing</hi> them f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rst. So that
<hi>Cain</hi> had an Example of Killing and Death just
before he practis'd the same on his Brother. yea,
perhaps <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he one suggested to him the other, and
being enraged with Anger against his Brother,
he resolv'd that he should fall a Sacrifice to his
Fury. And this Bloody Fact of his can admit of
no Excuse, because it was the product of perfect
Malice, as appears from that account which an
Inspired Writer hath given of it, telling us, that
Cain <hi>was of that wicked one,</hi> viz. Satan, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
slew his Brother, because his own Works were Evil,
and his Brother's Righteous,</hi> 1 John 3. 12. The grand
Aggravations of his Murder were, that he kill'd
his Own Brother, and that he kill'd him because
he was Good and Righteous. Now, we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
think that this Guilty Wretch, when he
came to entertain serious Thoughts, and to reflect
on his Execrable Paricide, grew very Black and
Melancholick. Though God reprieved this Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
as to his Life, yet he severely animadverted
upon him by that Terror and distraction of Mind,
by that Horror of Conscience which he inflicted
on him. He had <hi>Pashur</hi>'s Doom of <hi>Magor Missa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bib,</hi>
i. e. <hi>Fear round about,</hi> Jer. 20. 3. but especially
(as it follows there) he was <hi>a Terror to himself.</hi>
That this hath been the Fate of Murderers is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

<hi>Nero,</hi> that Bloody Villain, after he had put to

and burning Torches were flung at him,

continual Terror to himself, though he used all
Arts to divert his Thoughts, and when he awakned
in the Nights, labour'd to chase away his Affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by Musick, which he constantly call'd for.
These are some of the Transcripts which History
affords us of that First Murderer's inward Terrors
and Disquietudes. <hi>Mine Iniquity,</hi> saith he, <hi>is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than can be forgiven,</hi> ver. 13. (for so the words
may be rendred:) the Guilt of that Horrid Crime
which I have committed is unpardonable, I utterly
despair of the Divine Mercy. And this Despair
was not only his Sin but his Punishment: (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
some read it, <hi>My Punishment is greater than I
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:46315:409"/>
can bear.</hi>) So that he anticipated the Miseries of
the Damned, (of whom he was the first of Humane
Kind) and was in Hell while he was here on Earth.
Now it was that Dreadful Mormo's and Phantoms
possess'd his restless Brain, and he encreas'd his
Terrors by Imagination. He was afraid of his
own Father and Mother, and of his Female-self;
and his disorder'd Fancy represented many more
Persons to him: for a Troubled Conscience fears
where no Fear is, it fears Men where there are
none in being. Whence such Language as this is
very accountable, <hi>Every one that finds me shall slay
me.</hi> This is a satisfactory Answer, upon <hi>Supposal</hi>
(for I proceed only on that here) that there were
no more Men in the World at that time than
are expresly mention'd in <hi>Genesis.</hi> A Disturbed
Mind hath a Creating Power, and can make more
Inhabitants on the Earth than God hath made.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Supposing still that the Number of
Men was not greater than it is represented in
the Sacred Records, yet this Speech of <hi>Cain</hi> is
very accountable, for we may understand it of
People that were not yet born, but to come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
Observe therefore that 'tis spoken in the
Future Tense, It <hi>shall</hi> come to pass, that every
on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that findeth me <hi>shall</hi> slay me. <hi>Cain</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved,
and suffer'd to wander up and down, and
consequently to live some Years afterwards, it may
be rational to think that he refers in these words
to what should be in those days. When Mankind
shall be propagated, and the World be peopled,
th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n I shall go in fear of my Life, then <hi>every one</hi>
that finds me will slay me. And unto this the
nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> words may have relation, <hi>Whosoever slayeth</hi>
C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>in, <hi>Vengeance shall be taken of him sevenfold:</hi>
And moreover, <hi>The Lord set a mark upon</hi> Cain, <hi>lest
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46315:410"/>
any finding him should kill him,</hi> ver. 15. Lest in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
any one hearing of this bloody and cursed
Fact of his should be excited to revenge it on his
own Head, there was a Mark set upon this Vile
Wanderer, to distinguish him from the rest of
Mankind: but what it was we know not, though
the Jews have many idle and foolish Conjectures
about it. And a Penalty was threatned to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on the Person who should dare to kill him:
<hi>he was to be punish'd seven-fold,</hi> ver. 15. or <hi>in the
seventh Generation,</hi> as <hi>Munster</hi> and some others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
it: which implies, that <hi>Cain</hi> was to be a
Long-liver, to continue <hi>seven,</hi> i. e. many Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
So that we may look on these Words as
having reference to the Times that were to come,
and not to the present Season wherein they were
spoke. It <hi>shall</hi> come to pass, saith he, that in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
time, when the World is increased, <hi>every one</hi>
who finds me <hi>shall</hi> be greedy to take away my
Life, because I most inhumanely bereaved my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his. Thus there is no Contradiction or
Inconsistency in the words, when 'tis said, <hi>Every
one that findeth me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But in the fourth and last place, it might be
answer'd, (if what I have said already be not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory)
that this word <hi>Kol, every one,</hi> hath not
reference to Men but to Beasts. <hi>Every one</hi> is <hi>every
Wild Beast.</hi> He was afraid, saith<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiqu. l. 1. c. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus,</hi> lest
while he wandred up and down in the Earth,
(which was part of his Punishment) he should fall
among some Beasts, and be slain by them. God
bids him not fear any such thing, for he would
set such a Mark on him, that the very Irrational
Animals should be capable of knowing and discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:46315:410"/>
it. <hi>Every one</hi> is not necessarily to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of Men or Women, but may be meant of the
Brutes which were then upon Earth, and might be
Executioners of the Divine Vengeance on him
who was so savage and brutish. It will be very
hard for any Man to disprove this, and therefore
it is sufficient to take off and null the Cavil of the
Objectors. But, I confess, I rather think it is
spoken not of this sort of Creatures, but of those
Inhabitants of the Earth that were Intelligent.
Thus you see there is no Absurdity or Inconsistency
in those words which <hi>Cain</hi> utter'd, and which are
set down by the Sacred Historian, whether you
understand them of the then instant time, or of
that which was afterwards. Some Men of Profane
and Atheistical Spirits, and who have studied to
impair the Truth and Authority of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and particularly of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Writings, have
exposed this Place as disagreeing with the rest of
the Sacred Story concerning the first Rise and
Propagation of the World. But this is a very
shallow and vain Attempt, and grounded chiefly
on Prejudice and Ill-will against the Inspired Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
of Scripture. I have made it clear, that
there is no Absurdity, or any thing that looks like
it, in the words above-mentioned: and I defy that
Man who pretends to give any Satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to the Particulars which I have offered in
defence of them.</p>
                     <p>Again, 'tis said, <hi>That none save</hi> Caleb <hi>and</hi> Joshua
<hi>should come into the Land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 30.
and yet we read that <hi>Eleazar</hi> and others entred
into that Land, <hi>Ios.</hi> 14. 1. Chap. 22. 13. This is
objected by some as a Passage in Scripture deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
to the Truth of it. But if we will read the
Holy Book with the same Candour and Ingenuity
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:46315:411"/>
wherewith we read other Authors, we shall not
be offended at this, or the like Passages. For
nothing is more common in the most serious and
considerate Writers, than to speak things by way
of Restriction and Limitation, (as those words are
spoken) and yet to leave them to be understood
with some Latitude, which shall afterwards be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
and explain'd when they speak of the same
Matter. So here we read that none but <hi>Caleb</hi> and
<hi>Ioshua</hi> entred into the Land of Promise, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spoken of the Chief Leaders that had that
Privilege and Honour; but then, if we consult
other places where this thing is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
related, we shall find that a Larger meaning
was not excluded. We cannot think that the
Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> were denied entrance into that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Land, because 'tis evident from the History,
that they <hi>murmured not,</hi> and 'tis as evident that
'twas threatned to the <hi>Murmurers</hi> only, that <hi>they
should not see the Land which God swore unto their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi>
Numb. 14. 22, 23. therefore <hi>Eleazar</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi>
being Priests, are excepted. Again, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be meant of those that at that time were gone
to spy the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> for they were none
of the <hi>Murmurers,</hi> and therefore that Threatning
before cited doth not reach them, and consequently
those words are consistent with what we read in
other places relating to this matter.</p>
                     <p>But That in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 22, 23. is cried out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
as an unanswerable Repugnancy to <hi>Chap.</hi>
17. 55. for in the former we are told, that <hi>David</hi>
came to Court, <hi>and stood before King</hi> Saul, <hi>i. e.</hi>
waited continually upon him, <hi>and play'd upon the
Hart before him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and <hi>was greatly beloved of him,</hi>
and <hi>became his Aymour-bearer:</hi> and yet in the latter
we read that <hi>Saul</hi> did not know <hi>David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> but ask'd
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:46315:411"/>
who he was, <hi>Whose Son is this Youth?</hi> These seem
to be very repugnant to one another, but there
is really no such thing: all is clear and obvious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. 15. it is said, <hi>David went, and returned
from</hi> Saul, <hi>to feed his Father's Sheep at</hi> Bethlehem.
He stay'd not long at Court, either because he
liked not that manner of Life, or because <hi>Saul</hi> was
weary of him. <hi>David</hi> then having been absent
from <hi>Saul</hi> a considerable time, and following a
Country-Life, and now appearing perhaps in his
Shepherd's Weeds, it is no wonder that <hi>Saul</hi> did
not well know him. This, I think is sufficient of
it self, and clears the Text of all Contradiction:
though I know there are other Solutions used by
the Learned, as that of our English Rabbi, <hi>Saul</hi>
(saith he) asked <hi>whose Son David</hi> was, not that he
was ignorant who he was; but he only enquired
who that was that had such a Son. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is not of <hi>David</hi>'s Person, but Parentage.
So <hi>Lightfoot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Others are more <hi>Curious</hi> in their Objections, as
thus, Whereas the Diameter in respect of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference,
is as seven to two and twenty, this
is not observ'd in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 2. speaking of the
<hi>brazen Laver,</hi> and by consequence the <hi>Geometry</hi> of
Scripture is faulty. In answer to these men who
are such Well-willers to the Mathematicks, I
say first, That the Proportion of a Diameter to its
Circle is not exactly as seven to two and twenty:
therefore these Gentlemen are not exact them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Secondly, I say this, that the Scripture
oftentimes speaks after the Vulgar manner, (as I
have shew'd elsewhere) and it is likely it doth so
here, and then we must not expect Accuracy of
Words or Things. The Bible was not calculated
for them only that can square a Circle, or that
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:46315:412"/>
understand all the Mysteries of Algebra. Thirdly,
If this doth not satisfy, I answer, that the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference
of the <hi>brazen Sea</hi> was not exactly
Round, but it may be towards an Oval Figure,
which makes some alteration as to the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Diameter. It was <hi>ten Cubits from brim
to brim, and a Line of thirty Cubits did compass it
round about,</hi> saith the Text: but if it had been
quite orbicular, the Circumference must have been
one and thirty Cubits. Or, perhaps in this place
(as in several others) a round Number is express'd,
and the remainder being so small and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
is omitted.</p>
                     <p>But further 'tis Objected, that this <hi>Molten Sea</hi> or
Laver is said to <hi>contain 2000 Baths,</hi> 1 Kings 7. 26.
but in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 5. we read that it <hi>received and
held 3000 Baths;</hi> therefore some infer, that one of
these places is faulty, and ought to be corrected.
I answer, there is no need of it; because both
these are consistent. The Laver was of that vast
dimension, that it could hold 3000 Baths of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but it generally and usually contain'd but
2000. In a Synagogue of the Jews at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi>
there is one of these Lavers, and thence we may
solve the seeming difficulty: they fill it up to the
Neck, but not higher: but if they would fill it
higher, it would contain much more. The Neck
is large and of another figure, and is capable of
receiving a third part more.</p>
                     <p>Another Place which they alledg, cannot, they
will tell you, be answer'd any of these ways, for
it plainly Contradicts another place of Scripture
It is said of <hi>Asa,</hi> 2 Chron. 14. 5. <hi>he took away
the high Places;</hi> but in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 14. it is expresly
recorded that <hi>the high Places were not removed</hi> by
him. I answer first, there were two sorts of high
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46315:412"/>
Places, namely some where they worship'd Idols
and False Gods, others where they worship'd the
True God. The former were taken away, as is
intimated to us when 'tis said, <hi>he took away the

those Images were adored: but the latter were
not taken away, the Reformation which he had
set on foot had not gone so far. Besides, 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable
that he took away the high Places <hi>out of all
the Cities of</hi> Judah; which signifies to us that he
removed them out of <hi>all the Chief Places</hi> of his
Kingdom, though he had not time to effect it in
some other less considerable places; and so the
meaning of those words [<hi>the high Places were not
removed</hi>] may have reference only to these latter,
and shew that he had not expell'd Idolatry out
of every part of the Kingdom. The short is, this
Good King took away very many, he removed
most of the high Places, but not all. Where now
is the Contradiction?</p>

Authority of the Bible (as I have shew'd in a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

three Answers may remove the difficulty. 1. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
on the place salves it thus; many of the Old
Prophets Sayings were not written down, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in Memory, and deliver'd down to those
that came afterwards, of which he gives some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:
so that it is probable <hi>Zechary</hi> makes use
of one of these Sayings and Oracles of <hi>Ier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>my:</hi>
but when our Saviour quotes this Passage, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the first Author of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy.</hi>
The short is, though the words are in <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary,</hi>
yet he had them from <hi>Ieremy,</hi> that is, there
was a Tradition, it is likely, that they were his.
Which is consirmed by that Saying of the Jews,
that <hi>the Spirit of the Prophet</hi> Jeremy <hi>rested on</hi> Zechary.
For this reason, those words of <hi>Zechary</hi> may be
said to <hi>be spoken by</hi> Jeremy <hi>the Prophet.</hi> 2. Those
words are jointly to be found in <hi>Ieremy</hi> ad <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi>
but the former speaks only of <hi>buying the Field,
Ier.</hi> 32. 9. the latter makes mention of the <hi>Price,
Zech.</hi> 11. 12. But neither are these the <hi>very words</hi>
which are in <hi>Zechary</hi>'s Prophecy, but are recited
with some considerable <hi>alteration</hi> (as is not unusual
in Scripture, as you shall hear afterwards.) If
then the Substance of the words be taken out of
both the Prophets, the Evangelist might quote one
of them only without any Error and Mistake, and
particularly <hi>Ieremy</hi> might be named as the more
known and eminent Prophet. 3. Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi>
reconciles it another way, asserting, that there is
no Mistake of Transcribers here, but that <hi>Ieremy</hi>
was the Name first used in this place by St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
and yet <hi>Zecharias</hi> is not excluded, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
This he makes good from the ordering
and ranging of the Books of Scripture in use among
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:46315:413"/>
the Jews, in which this Learned Author was well
skill'd. <hi>Ieremia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and he is mention'd above all the rest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he stood first in the Volume of the Prophets:
Therefore when St. <hi>Matthew</hi> produced a Text of
<hi>Zechary</hi> under the name of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> he cites the
Words out of the Volume of the Prophets under
his Name, who stood first in that Volume, that is
the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah.</hi> Any of these Answers may
satisfy a Man whose Mind is not tainted with Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
against the Sacred Writings.</p>
                     <p>Those Words of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7. 15. <hi>Iacob
went down into</hi> Egypt, <hi>and died, he and our Fathers,
and were carried over into</hi> Sichem, <hi>and laid in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher
that</hi> Abraham <hi>bought for a Sum of Money of
the Sons of</hi> Emmor <hi>the Father of</hi> Sichem, seem to
have a double Repugnancy in them to what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in the History of <hi>Moses;</hi> for first we read
there, that not <hi>Iacob</hi> but <hi>Ioseph</hi> was carried to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem:</hi>
And secondly that <hi>Abraham</hi> bought the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher
not of the sons of <hi>Emmor,</hi> but of <hi>Ephron</hi>
the Hittite, <hi>Gen. 23. 17. ch.</hi> 49. 30. This latter
is the greater Difficulty, and seems to be most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable,
because 'tis so positively express'd, that
Abraham <hi>purchased the Field of</hi> Ephron <hi>the Son of
Zoar,</hi> and that <hi>Iacob bought the Field of the Children
of</hi> Emmor, <hi>Gen. 32. 19. Iosh.</hi> 24. 32. How there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can it be said in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that <hi>Abraham bought</hi>
the Field for a <hi>Sepulcher of the Children of</hi> Emmor?
<hi>Grotius</hi> takes away this Repugnancy, by bidding us
write <hi>Ephron</hi> for <hi>Emmor:</hi> but this way of answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture-Difficulties is not to be tolerated,
as I have suggested already on the like occasion.
Besides, this Alteration will not be sufficient to
take away the Difficulty, because <hi>Ephron</hi> was not
<hi>the Father of</hi> Sichem, which is here added. A late
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:46315:414"/>
Sagacious Critick tells us, that those of whom St.
<hi>Stephen</hi> here speaks, <hi>viz.</hi> the Patriarchs, were part
of them buried in <hi>Sichem,</hi> and part of them in the
Field that was <hi>Ephron</hi>'s. <hi>They were carried over into
Sichem, i. e.</hi> saith he, <hi>our Fathers,</hi> not <hi>Iacob,</hi> were
carried thither. And the Sense of the next Words
he thinks he salves by a <hi>Parenthesis</hi> thus, [<hi>and laid
in the Sepulcher (which</hi> Abraham <hi>had bought for a Sum
of Money) of the Sons of</hi> Emmor <hi>the Father of</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem.]
So that this Place doth not say, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were laid in the Sepulcher which was bought
by <hi>Abraham</hi> of the Sons of <hi>Emmor;</hi> no, for that
contradicts the Sacred History, which assures us,
that he bought it of <hi>Ephron</hi> the Hittite, but only
they were laid in the Sepulcher of the Sons of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor.</hi>
So Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull.</hi> This doth in part
satisfy the Scruple, but in my Judgment the best
and shortest Solution of it is that which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
suggested, and abundantly proved, that 'tis
usual for Persons in Scripture to have two Names.
So here, Abraham <hi>bought a Field for a Burial-place
of</hi> Ephron <hi>the Son of</hi> Zohar, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 8, 9. and yet
<hi>he bought it of the Son <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> Sons of</hi> Emmor; for this
<hi>Zohar</hi> and <hi>Emmor</hi> were the same Man, only with
two different Names which he was called by, as
was very common among the Hebrews. This is a
plain and easy resolving of the Doubt. And if
there seems to be any Repugnancy as to the Places
of Burial, <hi>Sichem</hi> and <hi>Hebron,</hi> I offer this, that the
Bodies of the Patriarchs might be translated from
the first Place, where they were deposited, to
another, <hi>i. e.</hi> they might be entomb'd at <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi>
the Sepulcher of the Sons of <hi>Emmor,</hi> and
afterwards be carried to <hi>Hebron,</hi> and laid in
a Sepulcher there. If we admit of this, then
<hi>Moses</hi>'s History concerning their Burial might
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46315:414"/>
refer to one Place, and St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Those Places also may seem to be Contradictory,
<hi>If I bear witness of my self, my witness is not true,</hi>
John 5. 31. and <hi>though I bear Record of my self, yet
my Record is true,</hi> ch. 8. 14. But the Resolution is
easy, Christ's Testimony concerning himself <hi>was
not true, i. e.</hi> valid in the Opinion of the Cavilling
Jews to whom he spake, because their Law required
two Witnesses: but his Testimony concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>was true,</hi> was authentick and valid, because he
was an Extraordinary Person, even God Himself,
and because likewise his Testimony concurr'd with
that of his Father, and so there was a Double Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Thus he explains himself in <hi>Iohn 8. 16. My
Iudgment is true, for I am not alone, but I and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that sent me.</hi> And again, <hi>ver. 18. I am one
that bear witness of my self: and the Father that sent
me beareth witness of me.</hi> Therefore it is plain that
Christ doth not absolutely exclude his own Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
concerning himself, and consequently the
Texts above alledged do not oppose one another.
This also may be referr'd to what we observed in
the beginning of this Discourse, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Negative</hi>
is often put for a <hi>Comparative.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And that of our Saviour, <hi>Think not that I am
come to send Peace upon Earth, I came not to send
Peace, but a Sword,</hi> Matth. 10. 34. may seem to be
repugnant to other Texts of Scripture which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
Christ as a Man of <hi>Peace.</hi> But this ariseth
from our misunderstanding his Words: his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, not that he directly intended, or primarily
design'd a <hi>Sword</hi> or <hi>Fire,</hi> (as<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 12. 49.</note> another Evangelist
expresses it) <hi>i. e.</hi> Persecution and Division. But
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46315:415"/>
his Words are to be understood as those in <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.
39. <hi>I came into this World for Iudgment, i. e,</hi> Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally
and by Accident his Coming would prove
to be for <hi>Condemnation.</hi> But this was not his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
as he saith, <hi>God sent not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>is Son into the World
to condemn the World,</hi> John 3. 17. And again, <hi>I
came not to judg the World,</hi> John 12. 47. You hear
what our Saviour saith, <hi>he came for Iudgment,</hi> and
<hi>he came not for Iudgment.</hi> In such a different Sense
<hi>he came to send a Sword,</hi> and <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e came not to send a
Sword:</hi> that is, it is Accidental, and not by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
that Slaughter and Contentions happen by
Christ's Coming. These are not the natural Effect
and Consequence of his Doctrine, and of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
it self, but they proceed from the corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and evil Dispositions of Men, who will not
entertain so harmless and innocent an Institution,
but are resov'd to oppose it. The <hi>Sword</hi> which
Christ is here said to <hi>send,</hi> is managed and wielded
by the Hands of Irreligious and Prophane Men:
<hi>the Fire</hi> is blown up and kindled by the Breath of
Anger and Passion, the Fuel of it is our own wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Nature, inordinate Lusts, and corrupt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
In a word, the Doctrine of Christ meeting
with the Vices of Men, becomes an <hi>occasion</hi> of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
Divisions, Bloodshed and Persecution.</p>
                     <p>When Christ sent forth his Apostles, he forbad
them to <hi>provide Staves,</hi> Matth. 10. 10. yet in <hi>Mark</hi>
6. 8. he permits them to take <hi>these</hi> for their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
But this seeming Inconsistency is removed by
remembring that there is a Necessary Staff, a Staff
to support them in their Travels, and there is an
Offensive Staff to encounter the Enemy with. The
latter was not allowed them, because they were not
to use any Violence, especially at this time, when
he sent them forth. So in the foresaid Place of

the Place, answers, that though there was at first
nothing in the Ark but the two Tables, yet it may
be afterwards the Pot of Manna and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod
were put into it; and this perhaps the Apostle had
by Tradition from the Jews, saith he. But <hi>Grotius</hi>
tells us, that it was the Opinion of the Old Rabins,
(in which he also acquiesces) that the Manna and
the Rod were in the Ark in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Days; but
afterwards, lest they should be mouldy and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy,
they were taken out, and deposited in some
subterraneous Vaults. But first thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> disagrees with
the former Solution, and yet the Jewish Doctors
are quoted for both. Again, I ask, were the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins
sure that these Holy Relicks were kept from
moulding in those low Cells or Receptacles of the
Earth? otherwise 'twas in vain to take them out of
their old Place, and lodg them here. Therefore I
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:46315:416"/>
look upon this as a mere Invention of the Rabinick
Tribe, as 'tis well known they abound with such.
Besides, we learn from the fore-cited Text in the
<hi>Kings,</hi> that these Sacred things were not in the
Ark, even in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time; and if they were not
there then at all, it is not likely the Apostle would
have said, <hi>Wherein (i. e.</hi> in the Ark) <hi>was the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Pot of Manna, and</hi> Aaron<hi>'s Rod;</hi> for who can
think that he refers to some after-Practice of the
Jews, and not to what is so plainly recorded to
have been at that time? therefore I look upon these
Answers as groundless. Another is wont to be

                        <hi>Drusius,</hi> who once

so the meaning is, that <hi>near the Ark</hi> stood the Pot
of Manna: But he checks himself for this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
apprehending it to be forced and strained.
Wherefore, to avoid all these Inconveniencies, I
reconcile that Place in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
with the former one in the <hi>Kings,</hi> thus, The <hi>Ark</hi>
is taken <hi>strictly</hi> in that former Place, but <hi>largely</hi> in
the latter one. In the first Sense, that is, as it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
the Principal Part or Division of the Ark,
it had nothing in it but the <hi>Tables,</hi> for the Chief
Apartment was designed for these, and therefore
'tis observable that the <hi>Ark</hi> hath its Name from
them, and is call'd the <hi>Ark of the Covenant;</hi> by which
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46315:416"/>
which is meant the <hi>Two Tables,</hi> as you'l see in
1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8 21. But as the Ark is taken <hi>largely,</hi> that
is, as it signifies the Whole Body of the Ark, and
all its Receptacles and Boxes, it contain'd in it
other things besides the <hi>Tables, viz.</hi> the Pot of
Manna, and <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod. This I propound as a
plain and easy Solution of the two fore-cited Texts.
The Manna and the Rod were in the Ark, and
they were not in it, <hi>viz.</hi> in different Respects:
they were in it, if you understand by it the Whole
Sacred Chest; but they were not in it, if you mean
by it the Chief and Eminent Part of it, which
oftentimes gave a Denomination to the Whole.</p>

Numb. 25. 9. saith, that those that died of the

sometimes different (i. e. it seems to be so) from
that in Prophane Authors, because several Places
mentioned in Holy Writ have not the same Names
which they are known by in other Writers. Whether
the Queen of Sheba came from Arabia or Ethiopia
is uncertain. Ophir is unknown to us: So is Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat:
But Tarshish is so named from Tarsus, a
Noted Town on the Mediterranean. How East and
West in Ezekiel are to be understood. Different
Meanings in Scripture arise from the Relation
which certain Words have in Texts to the adjoining
Chapters and Verses. Some Instances of this largely
prosecuted.</p>

BUT a great Cry there is that the Scripture is
defective, or in plain Terms false in its <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick:</hi>
and here many Places are muster'd up, as
That in <hi>Gen. 46. 27. All the Souls of the House of</hi>
Jacob <hi>which came into</hi> Egypt, <hi>were threescore and ten.</hi>
And again, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 22. they are said to be <hi>three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and ten Persons:</hi> so many they were, reckoning
<hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> into the Number. But how
doth this agree with St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Account in <hi>Acts</hi>
7. 14. Joseph <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nt and call'd his Father</hi> Jacob <hi>to him,
and all his Kindred, threescore and fifteen Souls?</hi> Here
is an Addition of five to the former Number. But
the Agreement of these Texts is not difficult, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we may say that <hi>Moses</hi> only reckons <hi>Iacob</hi>'s
Children and Grand-children, and not his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in Law, the Wives of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Sons, which in
all are seventy five. Or it may be said that St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
reckons up how great the Number of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:46315:417"/>
Family was before he came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and so takes
in <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Wives and <hi>Iudab</hi>'s Sons, although then
dead: Or thus, that he reckons some into the
Number who were begot before they came into
<hi>Egypt,</hi> but born after their coming thither. There
might be such a Tradition as this among the Jews,
and <hi>Stephen</hi> here makes use of it. Any of these
Answers is satisfactory in a Matter of this nature.
But by no means must we approve of <hi>Grotius</hi>'s shift,
<hi>viz.</hi> that it was the Fault of the Transcriber; he
inserted <hi>five</hi> more than he should have done.</p>
                     <p>Again, some ask what Agreement there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
those two Places, <hi>viz.</hi> Numb. 25. 9. <hi>Those
that died in the Plague were twenty and four thousand;</hi>
and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8. (which speaks of the same thing)
<hi>There fell in one Day three and twenty thousand.</hi> Here
is a Thousand short of the former Account: But
if you look into the Context, you'l soon reconcile
these two different Numbers, by taking notice that
there were two different Judgements or Plagues up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the People at that time. The Apostle num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
those only that were kill'd with the Plague
from Heaven, but <hi>Moses</hi> reckons those also who
were kill'd with the Sword, and hung up by the
Levites, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. Or, I conceive, the Difference
between the Numbers may lie in this, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
speaks only of what was done <hi>in one Day:</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis
may be in those Words; and so here is not
excluded the other thousand which fell at another
time. Some are dissatisfied because they read in
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10. that <hi>David</hi> was his Father's <hi>eighth
Son:</hi> and again in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 14. they find that he
is call'd <hi>the youngest Son</hi> of eight: and yet in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
2. 15. he is reckon'd <hi>the seventh Son.</hi> But the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer

latter signifies distinct <hi>Stalls</hi> for Horses, where they
stood asunder by themselves, one single Horse in a

wherein ten Horses were placed: therefore there
is a <hi>Iod,</hi> which is a Note of the number <hi>ten,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted

Horses in four thousand Stables. Or if it were

Ur <hi>of the Chaldees</hi> is call'd <hi>the Land of</hi> Haran, and
consequently <hi>of Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Nativity,</hi> Gen. 11. 28.
And in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 7. God reminded him that <hi>he
brought him out of</hi> Ur <hi>of the Chaldees:</hi> therefore
that was the Country which he first dwelt in. But
if we consult <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 10. we shall see that <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia</hi>
was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s native Country: and in <hi>Ios.</hi>
24. 2, 3. we read <hi>that he dwelt on the other side of the
Flood, i. e.</hi> of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> (which is frequently call'd
the <hi>Flood,</hi> by way of Eminency, in Scripture) and
this parted <hi>Canaan,</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> afterwards
dwelt, from <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> in <hi>Syria.</hi> This is <hi>the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
which</hi> Abraham <hi>passed over,</hi> Gen. 31. 21. when
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:46315:419"/>
he came into <hi>Canaan</hi> out of his own Country, and
from which <hi>passing over</hi> he had his Name, as is
thought by many of the Learned. So that when
'tis said he dwelt on the other side of the Flood,
it appears thence that he came out of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi>
which was divided from <hi>Canaan</hi> by that Flood.
But how are these two consistent, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was
a Chaldean and a Mesopotamian, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Syrian,
when these have reference to two distinct Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,

Answer, and a very good one: But I rather think
this to be the plainest Solution of the Difficulty,
<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> as distinct from <hi>Chaldea,</hi>
was <hi>Abraham</hi>'s native Soil, and that <hi>Vr</hi> was a City

it there, and not in <hi>Chaldea</hi>) and that this
very City was the Birth-place of <hi>Abraham:</hi> and
yet this <hi>Vr</hi> is said to be <hi>of the Chaldees,</hi> because it
was possessed by the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> at that time. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
have thought it was a part of <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and
properly belonged to it, because they read it to be
<hi>of the Chaldees:</hi> but this is a Mistake, for the true
Import of this Addition to the Word is only this,
that this part of <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> as well as the rest
of it, was under the Jurisdiction and Power of the
Chaldeans, and was inhabited by them: as <hi>Hebron</hi>
is call'd <hi>the Land of the Hebrews,</hi> Gen. 40. 15. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Hebrews dwelt there. Besides, I might
add, that this Place was defiled with the <hi>Idolatry of
the Chaldeans,</hi> and therefore for that reason also is
call'd <hi>Vr of the Chaldees.</hi> And from what hath

<hi>Gadara</hi> and <hi>Gergesa</hi> were neighbouring Towns,
their Fields lay close together. Every one grants
that the Inhabitants of <hi>Arabia</hi> had several Names
according to the Places and Regions they were

said to be sold both to the Ismaelites and Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
because the Company of Merchants who

Thus we see here is nothing inconsistent.</p>
                     <p>Some object against the <hi>Geography</hi> of Scripture,

                           </gap>s</hi>
would perswade us that <hi>Moses</hi> had two Wives,
one an Ethiopian, the other a Midianitess or Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian:
But there is no Foundation at all for this,
and therefore some other Answer is to be given.
Some are of opinion that <hi>Cushith,</hi> which is the
Word used in the Book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> should not
be translated an <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> but <hi>an Arabian Woman;</hi>
for <hi>Arabia</hi> was call'd <hi>Cush,</hi> because the Seat of
<hi>Cush,</hi> the eldest Son of <hi>Ham,</hi> was there, saith Sir
<hi>W. Raleigh.</hi> Whence he concludes that <hi>Moses</hi>'s
Wife was not an Ethiopian, though <hi>a Woman of
Cush,</hi> but an Arabian. And <hi>Bochart</hi> asserts the
same, and on the same Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> because <hi>Cush</hi>
was seated in <hi>Arabia,</hi> not in <hi>Et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iopia.</hi> But this
Opinion hath found but little Reception among
those who have further enquired into this Matter,
and have found that sometimes the word <hi>Cush</hi> in
the Old Testament must necessarily be understood
of <hi>Et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iopia.</hi> Therefore it is more reasonable to
adhere to those Authors who affirm that <hi>Cush</hi> is an
ambiguous Word, and that not only <hi>Arabia</hi> but
<hi>Ethiopia</hi> is expressed by that Name. Or rather,
there is a double <hi>Et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iopia;</hi> one in <hi>Africa,</hi> beyond
<hi>Egypt,</hi> under the Torrid Zone; the other in <hi>Asia,</hi>
and particularly in some part of <hi>Arabia.</hi> And
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:46315:421"/>
that there are both these <hi>Ethiopia's,</hi> is testified by
<hi>Philostratus, Herodotus,</hi> and <hi>Pausanias.</hi> This lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Asiatick Ethiopia,</hi> is meant in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Place, where 'tis said, <hi>Moses</hi> married a
<hi>Cushite, an Ethiopian Woman:</hi> She was not of the
<hi>African</hi> but the <hi>Asian Cush</hi> or <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> and so it
well agrees with the other Text, where we are
told she was a <hi>Midianite.</hi> Nor is this to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at, that <hi>Cush</hi> is thus differently taken; for it
might be proved from several Examples, that one
and the same Name is given to two or three Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
Thus there is <hi>Caesarea</hi> in <hi>Palestine</hi> and in the
Lesser <hi>Asia:</hi> There is <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> in <hi>Pisidia,</hi>
and in <hi>Caria:</hi> There is <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Chaldea</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt:</hi>
There is <hi>Thebes</hi> in <hi>Baeotia,</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in
<hi>Cilicia:</hi> There is <hi>Heliopolis</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Coelosyria,</hi>
and <hi>Cilicia:</hi> There is <hi>Albania</hi> in <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:</hi>
And so in our neighbouring Countries there
is <hi>Zeland</hi> in <hi>Denmark</hi> and in the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> And
not only in <hi>France,</hi> but <hi>England,</hi> several Places
have the same Name. But although this be very
satisfactory, yet I am inclined to offer another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of the Place, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Midian</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from <hi>Ethiopia</hi> only by the Red Sea, a short
Passage, and by reason of this Nearness <hi>Midian</hi> is
call'd in Soripture the Land of <hi>Cush</hi> or <hi>Ethiopia;</hi>
and thence <hi>Zippora</hi> is call'd a <hi>Cushite;</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
according to the Seventy Interpreters, an <hi>Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>
She is call'd so, I say, because the Midianites
dwelt near to the African Ethiopians, and thence
sometimes had their Name communicated to them.
<hi>Midian</hi> being a neighbouring Country, was call'd
<hi>Ethiopia;</hi> and those other Parts of <hi>Asi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

as at this Day, among Cosmographers,
some Places that border on other Countries are
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:46315:421"/>
sometimes said to belong to them, and to be Parts
of them, and are call'd by their Name. Thus <hi>Tyre</hi>
and <hi>Sidon,</hi> of old were reckon'd both in <hi>Syria</hi> and
<hi>Palestine.</hi> And in our modern Geography <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Places in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> and <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rank'd among those of <hi>France.</hi> Some Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers
place <hi>Lorain</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> others in <hi>France.</hi>
The <hi>Alpes</hi> are divided among the Germans, Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
French, and so are said to belong to all of
them. <hi>Piedmont</hi> is reckon'd both in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Italy.</hi> So it is in the present Case; the Vic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nity of
the Place to some other, causes the Name to be
communicated to both. The <hi>Midianites</hi> and other
People, because they bordered on <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> were
call'd <hi>Ethiopians:</hi> hence <hi>Cushan</hi> or <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>the
Land of Midian</hi> are join'd together, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 7.
Lastly, it is probable that <hi>Cush,</hi> the eldest Son of
<hi>Cham,</hi> was seated not only in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> but in those
Parts of <hi>Arabia</hi> which were bordering upon it: and
thence it comes to pass that a <hi>Cushite</hi> or a <hi>Woman of
Cush</hi> is an <hi>Arabian</hi> as well as an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> properly
so call'd.</p>
                     <p>She that is call'd a <hi>Woman of</hi> Canaan, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.
22. is call'd a <hi>Syrophoenician,</hi> Mark 7. 26. which

they think the former Word should be <hi>Cana,</hi>
which was a Town in <hi>Phoeni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

the Name of the <hi>Greater Cana,</hi> for there was a

But especially the People of this Country

This I mention to remind us that there is a

                     <p>This I will more largely insist upon in some few
particular Instances: And first that in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.

of <hi>the Queen of</hi> Sheba, who is call'd <hi>the Queen
of the South</hi> by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 42. but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
she came from <hi>Arabia</hi> or <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> both which
Countries are South of <hi>Iudea,</hi> is as much contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
as whether <hi>Moses</hi>'s Wife was an Arabian
or an Ethiopian. Monsieur <hi>Bochart</hi> and some others
say she was the former, for there was a <hi>Saba</hi> or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>
(as<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Strabo</hi> informs us) in that Country. Some
tell us it is the Metropolis of <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> now

think that this was the Country whence this Royal
Visitant came, and that for this one good Reason,
because our Saviour himself hath informed us that

to say is this, that there was a Nation of this Name

to acquaint us what particular Region it

Truth in it, that the Names of Nations have been

                     <p>This we find true in another Instance, <hi>viz.
Ophir,</hi> the Place that King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Navy went to,

Author thinks; which is a very Ingenious and
Learned Conjecture, but is entertained but by few,
because 'tis thought that <hi>Columbus</hi> was the first that
found out the <hi>Western World.</hi> But whether that
be true or no, it is not probable that they had Skill
enough in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Days to conduct a Navy to the
<hi>West-Indies.</hi> Navigation was not so perfect at that
time, that they could find a safe Passage thither.
<hi>Hercules</hi>'s Pillars (which are now the <hi>Cape of Good
Hope</hi>) were said to be the Limits of their Maritime
Travels. Before the Use of the <hi>Compass</hi> it was
impossible to havigate cross the Ocean; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<hi>Solomon</hi>'s Mariners could not find <hi>Peru,</hi>
which is in <hi>America.</hi> Besides, some think that the
Quality of some of the Commodities, <hi>viz. Wood</hi>
and <hi>Ivory,</hi> which were brought home in the Ships,
argues that they came not from that <hi>Western</hi> Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the World. Again, 'tis added by some,
that if <hi>Solomon</hi> had sent for Gold to the <hi>West-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
he would have set out his Fleet for that Voyage
from some Port of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and not of
the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> as we read he did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 26.

                        <hi>Kircher</hi> is more general, and

only his Word for this, and no more. Others
hold it to be neither in the <hi>East</hi> nor <hi>West-Indies,</hi>
but in <hi>Africk,</hi> which seems to me to be the most
probable Perswasion. <hi>Ortelius</hi> and <hi>Purchas</hi> are of

                        </gap>k Sea, and is at this day call'd <hi>Sophala:</hi>
But they might as well have assign'd any other Place
and Name in this Country, if they had pleased,
for here is no firm Ground to go upon; we have
no Chard to direct us. <hi>Ophir</hi> is a Name not known
to any Geographers: no Pagan Writers make
mention of it. This happens because several Places
have chang'd their Names, they are not the same
now that they were heretofore. And how is it
possible then that we should arrive to a certain
Knowledg of them? And what though we do not?
There is no reason why we should be troubled at it,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:46315:425"/>
much less that we should be displeased with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.,
Yea, rather we may make use of this to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the Holy Writings, for this is an undeniable
Argument of the unparallell'd Antiquity of them,
(as hath been suggested before) and of their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
Worth and Excellency, in that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
those Names of Places as well as Things
which other Writers say nothing at all of.</p>
                     <p>To these Instances I will add one more, <hi>the
Mountains of</hi> Ararat, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 4. on which the Ark
rested. They are not mentioned under this Name
by any Heathen Authors; and thence it is difficult
to give an Account of them, <hi>i. e.</hi> to know where
they were, and consequently where the Ark land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The Hills of <hi>Armenia the Greater,</hi> call'd the
<hi>Gordiaean</hi> Hills, are meant, say <hi>Iosephus,</hi> St. <hi>Ierom,
Bochart, Grotius:</hi> and before these <hi>Berosus</hi> held the
same. But there is another Opinion maintain'd by
<hi>Goropius Becanus,</hi> Sir <hi>W. Raleigh,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Heylin,
viz.</hi> that the Ark rested on Mount <hi>Taurus,</hi> but
especially on the Top of Mount <hi>Caucasus</hi> (which is
a Part of it) in the Confines of <hi>Tartaria, Persia,</hi>
and <hi>India;</hi> which they think they prove from
<hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 2. where we read that they who enter'd
into the Valley of <hi>Shinar</hi> came <hi>from the East,</hi> i. e.
from those Parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> on the South of <hi>Caucasus,</hi>
which lie East from <hi>Shinar.</hi> And this is thought to
be a sufficient Confutation of the former Opinion,
for it is impossible they should come from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of <hi>Armenia,</hi> the Gordiaean Mountains, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
those lie not only full North of <hi>Shinar,</hi> but
many Degrees unto the West. This <hi>Caucasus</hi> was
part of the Mountain <hi>Taurus,</hi> the biggest Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in the World; or rather (as hath been said in
another Place before) a continual Ridg of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
crossing all <hi>Asia</hi> from East to West, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:46315:425"/>
it as the Equator doth the Globe, into North
and South. So that in short, <hi>Ararat,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to these Authors is the Scripture-word for
<hi>Taurus,</hi> is no more One Mountain than any one
Hill among those that divide <hi>Italy</hi> from <hi>France</hi> is
call'd the <hi>Alpes,</hi> or any one of those that part
<hi>France</hi> from <hi>Spain</hi> is the <hi>Pyren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </hi> But as these,
being Continuations of many Hills, keep one Name
in divers Countries, so all that long Ledg of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
(which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls by one Name <hi>Taurus</hi>) are
of one general Name, and are call'd <hi>the Mountains
of</hi> Ararat. These are the two <hi>different</hi> Opinions of
the Learned about this Matter; but it is my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
that a Man may easily compromise them:
For, according to that Description which Sir. <hi>W.
Raleigh</hi> gives us of this great Multiplicity of Hills,
the <hi>Gordiaean</hi> ones may be taken in among those
that make up <hi>Taurus,</hi> for this Learned Knight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
acknowledgeth that these Mountains (which
go through so many diverse Countries and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms)
seem to take their Rise from <hi>Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>nia,</hi> or
thereabouts. So that it is probable the <hi>Gor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iaean</hi>
Hills, and those of <hi>Taurus,</hi> are to be reckon'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Thus we may moderate between these
Dissenting Writers: but when all is done, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to define exactly what Mountains are
meant by those of <hi>Ararat.</hi> This only is unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
that they were in the <hi>East;</hi> but as to their
particular Situation, and whether they answer to
the <hi>Gordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ean</hi> Hills, or to <hi>Caucasus,</hi> we are wholly
ignorant. And there is no Remedy for it, because
<hi>Ararat</hi> is not a Name that we can find in any other
Authors; and we are not certain that any other
Denominations in Pagan Writers refer to it. Thus
it must needs be, seeing the old Names of several
Places are extinct, and others are introduced: so
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46315:426"/>
that on that Account we can't expect to know some
of those Places that are mention'd in Scripture.
Nor is it necessary that we should, for it is a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of small Moment, and not worth the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about.</p>
                     <p>Some dream of a great <hi>Geographical Difficulty</hi> in
the word <hi>Tarshish,</hi> so often used in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but there is no reason for it, because it
plainly refers to a known Place, and such as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly

those of the Bible, and that is <hi>Tarsus</hi> in <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia.</hi>
The Sea which washed the Shores of this <hi>Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi>
had its Name from this Metropolis of it, <hi>viz.
Tarsus,</hi> and was usually called <hi>Tarshish.</hi> This is the

be a common Word in Scripture to signify the <hi>Sea,</hi>
(as hath been said) yet here we must take it in the
most restrained Sense of all, we must understand
by it the Town of that Name; and from whence
the <hi>Sea,</hi> but more particularly the Phoenician and
Tyrian Sea, had the Denomination of <hi>Tarshish.</hi>
The Reason which I give of this Interpretation is
this, because in that Place of <hi>Ionah, Tarshish</hi> and
<hi>the Sea</hi> are expresly distinguish'd, and that not once.

where you will see that <hi>Hajam</hi> the Sea, is

not to be translated the <hi>Sea,</hi> but that it denotes.
that known City <hi>Tarsus</hi> of <hi>Cilicia.</hi> To this Place
the Timerous Prophet had a mind to flee, because
it was sufficiently remote, and also because there
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:46315:427"/>
was a safe Harbour to put into. There need not
then be any Dispute about the word <hi>Tarshish,</hi> for
where-ever it is used in Scripture (except in this
Place last mentioned) it signifies either the Sea in
general, or more especially the Phoenician or Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
Sea, which the Tyrian Merchants were most
used to: but it hath its Name from <hi>Tarsus</hi> or <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi>
near to which was the most famous Port of all
the East Country, from whence they took Ship for
<hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> and the most remote Parts of the
World.</p>
                     <p>To close up all the <hi>Geographical</hi> Scruples, I will
only adjoin this concerning the mentioning of <hi>East</hi>
and <hi>West</hi> in the Old Testament, that these are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
to be understood according to the Situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Iudea,</hi> more especially <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and as the
Places spoken of had respect to these; but in the
Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> it is for the most part other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
because <hi>Ezekiel</hi> writ in <hi>Babylon;</hi> and thence
it is that <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> are contrary here to what
they are in other Prophets. This I thought fit to
add to prevent Cavils against the Sacred Writ.</p>
                     <p>I might in the next place take notice of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Meanings which arise from the <hi>Relation</hi> which
certain Words in some Texts have to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Verses. Thus it is said, <hi>the Poor shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
cease out of the Land,</hi> Deut. 15. 11. yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
if not expressed, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. that <hi>there shall be
no Poor among them.</hi> But the Answer is, that this
<hi>4th</hi> Verse refers to the releasing and forgiving
their Debtors, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. They must not by their
<hi>exacting</hi> make their Neighbours poor; yea, they
must do what lies in their power, that there may
be <hi>no Poor:</hi> but as to <hi>the Event,</hi> there will be Poor,
and always shall be.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="389" facs="tcp:46315:427"/>
                        <hi>Their Strength is to sit still,</hi> saith the Prophet,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 7. which [<hi>their</hi>] if you refer to the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
who are named in that Verse, then the Sense
is, Their Strength, their Aid, their Assistance is
to no purpose; they had as good sit still as help the
Jews. But if you refer <hi>their</hi> to the <hi>Iews,</hi> then the
Interpretation is this, The Jews had best to sit
still in their own Land, and not to require Aid
from <hi>Egypt,</hi> for it shall not prosper. This is the
true Sense of the Words, because their <hi>Proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi>
is to the <hi>Iewish</hi> People; which we are sure
of, because these are the subject Matter of this Part
of the Chapter. The right fixing of the <hi>Relation</hi>
of the Words, especially of the Pronoun <hi>their,</hi>
leads us to the true meaning of the Place. And
this is put out of all Controversy by <hi>ver. 15. In R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Comment on the former Words, and shews that
we have pitch'd upon the true Reference.</p>
                     <p>I interpret those Words in <hi>Heb. 12. 24. The Blood
of Sprinkling, which speaks better things than that of
Abel,</hi> by observing what they particularly <hi>refer</hi> to,
<hi>viz. ver.</hi> 4. of the foregoing Chapter, <hi>By it he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead yet speaketh.</hi> I conceive that this <hi>Speaking</hi>
is referr'd to by the Apostle in the other Place;
and so by searching into the true Meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>he speaks,</hi> we shall be able to arrive to the
true Sense of the other. This Word hath been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
interpreted; for <hi>Grotius</hi> seems to think it is
meant, that he (i. e. <hi>Abel) speaks in the Book of
Genesis,</hi> which speaks of him. But this is very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
because the Apostle mentions not here what
<hi>Book</hi> speaks of <hi>Abel,</hi> but by what he himself speaks,
<hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Faith.</hi> Others say his Faith and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
<hi>speak, i. e.</hi> call to us to imitate and practise
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:46315:428"/>
them: but this might have been said of any of the
other Worthies mentioned in this Chapter, and
therefore is not peculiar to <hi>Abel</hi> alone. Others take
the word in a Passive Sense, and expound it, <hi>he is
yet spoken of,</hi> his eminent Faith and Innocency are
to this Day (as in several Generations before)
spoken of, celebrated, praised, remembred with
Honour. But this (as well as the former) is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all the other Holy Patriarchs and Worthy
Saints named in this Chapter, and therefore this
doth not reach that particular and proper Meaning
of the Place. Much less doth that odd Exposition
of Sir <hi>N. Knatchbull,</hi> who reads it thus, <hi>For it (i. e.</hi>
his Faith) <hi>he is yet said to be dead;</hi> for he will have
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to be inserted after <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and then the
meaning is, As <hi>Abel</hi> suffered at first for his Faith,
so he is still to this Day said to have died for his
Faith. But besides the needless inserting of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
and thereby making very bald Greek, he joins in
Construction <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> with <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, whereas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the usual way of <hi>Trajection</hi> (which he
so often takes notice of in other Places, though he
overlooks it here) it belongs to <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and so
the Words are to run thus, <hi>By it he, though he be
dead, yet speaks;</hi> that is, because of his Faith and
Holiness he yet <hi>speaks aloud,</hi> or <hi>cries</hi> unto God for
Vengeance against his Brother <hi>Cain,</hi> who inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
murder'd him; for he barbarously and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
took away his Life, because he was a <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
and <hi>righteous</hi> Person. Thus I interpret the
Words, because I discern that the Apostle alludes
to <hi>Gen. 4. 10. The Voice of thy Brother's Blood crieth
unto me from the Ground.</hi> Wherefore when he
saith, Abel <hi>yet speaketh,</hi> it is as much as if he had
said, <hi>his Blood speaketh</hi> or <hi>crieth.</hi> It spake long
ago, and it <hi>yet speaks,</hi> like the Souls under the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:46315:428"/>
                        <hi>Rev. 6. 10. How long, O Lord, holy and true,
dost thou not judg and avenge our Blood?</hi> Now by this
Text I expound that other in <hi>Heb. 12. 24. The Blood
of Sprinkling that speaketh better things than</hi> Abel, for
so it is in the Greek. The Apostle having said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
[Abel <hi>yet speaks</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> the Voice of his Blood
speaketh or crieth to Heaven for Vengeance; he
here with particular reference to that Passage as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
us, that <hi>Christ's Blood speaks</hi> better things than
<hi>Abel,</hi> or than the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> which was shed
by his Brother: for whereas that spoke and cried
for Punishment, this pleads for Mercy and Pardon.
Christ's Oblation of himself on the Cross, by the
Effusion of his Blood, <hi>speaks better things,</hi> doth more
atone and appease the Wrath of God than the
Blood of <hi>Abel</hi> (who was spitefully murder'd) did
incense and provoke it. Thus this is a good way
of interpreting Scripture sometimes, by comparing
one Text with another, and observing their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<hi>Relation.</hi> Many obscure and less intelligible Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
are clear'd by this Means.</p>
                     <p>I will content my self with mentioning one Place
more, <hi>viz.</hi> Mat. 24. 34. <hi>This Generation shall not
pass till all these things be fulfilled:</hi> Which remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Words of our Saviour may seem to have been
mistaken by those Interpreters that I have met
with, and merely because they have not minded
the <hi>Reference</hi> of the Words. Some have taken <hi>this
Generation</hi> for the Generation then in being in our
Saviour's time; and so they apprehend him to
speak of something that was <hi>soon after</hi> to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd,
not unlike some of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Visions which
<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 1. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>were to come to pass in a short time;</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that those Signs of his Coming, which he had
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:46315:429"/>
foretold in that Chapter, were to be every Day
expected; and if they were meant of his General
and Final Coming, then that the Overthrow of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi>
and of the <hi>World,</hi> should be about the same
time. And that <hi>some</hi> of the Signs mentioned by
Christ are to be understood properly and peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the <hi>Iewish Nation,</hi> soems to be clear from that
one Passage in <hi>ver. 20. Pray that your Flight be not on
the Sabbath-day;</hi> which intimates that the <hi>Iewish</hi>
People were particularly concern'd, who solemnly
observed that Day. By <hi>this Generation</hi> then they
understand the present Generation of the Jews
which was at that time: and to confirm this, they
observe that <hi>this Generation</hi> is applied by Christ to
the Jews of that Age, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 12. The Meaning
then of [<hi>this Generation shall not pass,</hi> &amp;c.] accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this Acception of the Word, is this, that
whilst the Jews then living were upon the Earth,
those things which our Saviour had foretold in that
Chapter, yea all those things should be fulfill'd.
This were a very good Interpretation of the
Words, if the thing it self could be proved, that
is, that within so short a time <hi>all</hi> those Predictions
of Christ were accomplish'd. But the contrary is
very evident, for the Chapter speaks of the Day of
Judgment as well as of the Devastation of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi>
wherefore all the things that our Lord spoke
of were not fulfill'd within the Compass of <hi>that
Generation,</hi> and consequently that Period of Time
could not be meant when it is said, <hi>This Generation
shall,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, therefore others who are
sensible of the Invalidity of this Interpretation,
understand <hi>this Generation</hi> in a wider and larger
Sense, and think that by it is meant the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<hi>Dispensation,</hi> the whole Series of Time from
our Saviour's Days to the End of the World, the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:46315:429"/>
final Upshot of all things. And this is a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of the Text, and salves the Sense very
well; only there is no Proof that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifies
the last Age of the World. This Period of Time

<hi>This Generation of Heaven and Earth
shall pass away, but my Words</hi> (my Predictions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
future things, which you have just now
heard from my Mouth) <hi>shall not pass away.</hi> Which
is as much as if he had said, This great Structure of
the World shall perish at last, Heaven and Earth
shall be destroyed by a general Conflagration; but
new Heavens and a new Earth shall arise in their
room, which shall be a Building not made with
Hands, not of perishing Materials, but such as shall
last eternally. And of this Nature is my <hi>Word</hi> and
<hi>Promise,</hi> such are all my <hi>Predictions,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this of the Signs of my Coming, it shall never
be null'd and abolish'd. The applying of the words
<hi>shall pass to the Heavens and Earth</hi> immediately
after, shews that Christ means by <hi>this Generation</hi>
the whole World, expressed by <hi>Heaven and Earth.</hi>
You see then how sitly 'tis said here, <hi>Heaven and
Earth shall pass away,</hi> it referring to <hi>this Generation's
passing away, viz.</hi> at the End of the World, the
final Close of all things, when there shall be <hi>new
Heavens and a new Earth,</hi> as<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Epist. ch. 3. v. 13.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> informs us.
Our Saviour here signifies the <hi>Time</hi> when the things
he spoke of last (<hi>ver.</hi> 24, 25.) shall be accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
When <hi>this Generation,</hi> this present Creation
of things shall be dissolved, then and not before <hi>all
these things shall be fulfilled:</hi> Then shall be verified
all those things which were said concerning the
Dissolution of the World; yea, all the things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in this Chapter: For we must know, that
even the Predictions concerning the Destruction of
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:46315:430"/>
                        <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> shall be most signally fulfilled in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Dissolution of Heaven and Earth, because that
was designed to be a Type and Representation of
this. And as for the word <hi>this,</hi> which is join'd
with <hi>Generation,</hi> if any cavil at it, I can prove out
of<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 26. 13. this Gospel: Acts 5. 20. this Life: <hi>and other Places. So</hi> that, Mat. 7. 22. 1 John 3. 12. <hi>and</hi> these, 1 Cor. 12. 2. 2. Tim. 1. 12. <hi>are prefixed, where there is no reference to any thing going before.</hi>
                        </note> abundance of Texts, that it is sometimes of
the same Import with <hi>the:</hi> and so you might read
it <hi>the Generation, viz.</hi> of the Heavens and Earth.
But here, as I conceive, it is an Emphatical Word,
and refers to the things spoken of before, <hi>viz. the
Sun, Moon, Stars, Earth and Sea,</hi> ver. 29. of this
Chapter: and <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 26. which further confirms
the Acception of this Word which I propound,
<hi>viz.</hi> that it is meant of <hi>the Works of the Creation.</hi>
Or perhaps our Saviour did cast his Eyes about,
and intentively beheld the Heavens and the Earth,
and then pronounced these Words, <hi>This Generation,</hi>
this Fabrick of the World which I now behold, and
all the Works in it, shall not be dissolv'd till that
very time, when these my Predictions shall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.
The fulfilling of my Words, and the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
of all things, shall happen at the same time.
And lastly, I will not conceal my Conjecture that
these Words of <hi>Christ</hi> refer to what he had said in
his Excellent Sermon on the Mount; and if so, then
this Interpretation which I have offered, will be
thereby exceedingly confirmed. His Words there
are these, <hi>Verily I say unto you, till Heaven and
Earth pass, one Iot or one Tittle shall in no wise pass
from the Law, till all be fulfilled,</hi> Mat. 5. 18. And
his Words here run thus, <hi>Verily I say unto you, this
Generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled:

Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but my Words shall

                           </gap>d</hi>). Thirdly, that considerable Passage,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>till all be fulfilled,</hi> is in both
Places, and refers to the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ame things, <hi>viz. the
Law,</hi> or <hi>Words,</hi> or Predictions of our Saviour,
what he had said, or what had been said of him.
And, Fourthly, the Works of the Creation, the
Fabrick and System of the World, are spoken of in
both Places, though under different Expressions;
for in the former they are stiled <hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi>
in the latter <hi>the Generation.</hi> But that they are of
the same Import, and express to us the same thing,
is clear from this, that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is exactly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to both: for though we make some little Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in our English Translation, rendring the
Greek Word by <hi>passing</hi> in one Verse, and <hi>passing
away</hi> in the other, yet the Verb it self is the same
in the Original, and accordingly should (if we
would be accurate) be rendred alike in both Verses.
Whence it appears that the <hi>Generations passing,</hi> and
<hi>the Heavens and Earth passing,</hi> are Synonymous,
which is the thing I aim'd at, and which puts a
Key into our Hand to open these Words, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>this Generation</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 34. is the same with <hi>Heaven
and Earth in ver.</hi> 35. and that their <hi>passing</hi> is the
very same. If it be said that <hi>this Generation,</hi> in
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:46315:431"/>
some other Place, is applied to <hi>that present Age</hi> and
People of the Jews, and therefore it must be so
understood here; the Consequence must be denied,
and that with very good Reason, for (besides what
hath been said already) in several Places we find
that the same Words and Expressions are not used
and applied after the same manner, and to the same
purpose. He is a Stranger to the Bible, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
the New Testament, who knows not this.
And therefore from the Identity of Words we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
necessarily infer that the same thing is intended.
But we are to examine the Ambiguity of Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to apply them as we see occasion. This
we must do here, and if we have Respect to the
Context, (as we ought to have) we shall apply <hi>this
Generation</hi> after the aforesaid manner. And indeed
the Connection of these two Verses was that which
led me first to this Interpretation, for the mention
of <hi>Heaven and Earth passing,</hi> in this latter Verse,
suggested to my Thoughts, that it had some Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
with the like Expressions in the foregoing
Verse; which, upon farther Examination, I found
to be so indeed. Christ proceeds in <hi>ver.</hi> 35. to
speak of <hi>Heaven and Earth passing,</hi> because he had
in <hi>ver.</hi> 34. been speaking of the same thing; which
gives us Assurance of what I propounded, that
<hi>this Generation's passing,</hi> and <hi>Heaven and Earth's
passing,</hi> are exegetical of each other. This is the
Exposition which I give of this Place, and I submit
it to the Censure of the Considerate and Judicious.
This I only say, that as 'tis a fair Construction, and
contains nothing inconsistent in it, so I deem it to
be the best Solution whereby we can cleverly avoid
the Quarrels of Expositors about the Words, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
about the Meaning of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which
(as several other Places of Scripture) is misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:46315:432"/>
because the due <hi>Reference</hi> of the Words is
not attended to.</p>

Bondage in Egypt did not last above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifteen Years. It is said, Acts 13. 20.
After that he gave them Judges about the Space

the Prophet: Yet, according to the usual Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there were but three hundred and thirty nine
Years from the first Iudg till Samuel. God gave
unto them Saul by the Space of forty Years,
Acts 13. 21. yet no Man thinks that he reigned so
long. This salves many Chronological Difficulties,
that the Kings of Israel often made their Sons Kings,
in their own Reign. Other Doubts in Chronology are
cleared by Interregnums, by omitting the Years of
Bad Kings, and of the Years of Oppression, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
and Anarchy. The Difficulties in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Genealogy in Mat. 1. &amp; Luke 3. resolved,
viz. how it can be said, Ozias begat Joatham. A
Scruple about the three Tesseradecads. Another
about Jechonias's begetting Salathiel. How Cainan
came to be inserted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How either of the Genealogies

Jacob and of Heli. Several Occasions (besides
what have been mention'd before) of the Difficulties
in Scripture, viz. it was writ by Different Persons:
It refers to Antient Practices now almost unknown
or forgot, (where the Author's Conjecture about the

Hebrew Text especially hath some things proper to it
self, which render it obscure in some Places. It is the
way of the Hebrews to express things briefly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely,
abruptly. Their peculiar Idiom admits not of
an exact Translation. Order and Time are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
observed. The Abstrusity of Scripture in some
Places is an Argument of its Worth and Excellency.</p>

                     <p>
                        <pb n="399" facs="tcp:46315:432"/>
I Will now, according to my propounded Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
speak of those <hi>Difficulties</hi> which arise
from the <hi>Duration of Time</hi> wherein such and such
things were done, or came to pass. The first Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nological
Doubt which I shall mention is that in
Gen. 15. 13. <hi>Thy Seed shall be a Stranger in a Land
that is not theirs, and shall serve them, and they shall
afflict them four hundred Years.</hi> So long the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
were to serve the Egyptians, and be afflicted
by them: Which is confirmed in <hi>ver. 16. In the
fourth Generation they shall come hither again,</hi> that is,
after four hundred Years (mentioned before) the
Israelites shall be delivered from their Slavery in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and shall return to <hi>Canaan.</hi> But it is well
known and confess'd by all Men, that the Israelites
were not in <hi>Egypt</hi> so long a time, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did not serve them, nor were afflicted by them so
many years. It is generally acknowledged that their
Bondage in <hi>Egypt</hi> did not last above two hundred
and 15 Years at most: And so the<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiqu. I. 2. c. 6.</note> Jewish Historian
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:46315:433"/>
himself computes it. Here then seems to be a
great Mistake as to <hi>Time:</hi> But really there is none,
but those rather who think the forementioned
Words are spoken wholly of the Time of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
Servitude in <hi>Egypt</hi> are mistaken, which we
shall the better apprehend if we take notice of the
Text as it is quoted by St. <hi>Stephen</hi> in <hi>Acts. 7. 6. God
spake in this wise that his Seed should sojourn in a strange
Land, and that they should bring them into Bondage,
and intreat them evilly four hundred Years.</hi> The four
hundred Years, as you may observe, refer not only
to the latter but the former part of the Verse, <hi>viz.</hi>
to the <hi>sojourning in a strange Land,</hi> which may be
applied to <hi>Canaan</hi> as well as <hi>Egypt:</hi> so that this
Term of four hundred Years includes all the Time
from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s leaving his own Country till the
Departure out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> In all this space of Time
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed were <hi>Sojourners</hi> and Pilgrims, were
<hi>evilly intreated,</hi> and suffer'd <hi>Bondage</hi> and Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But the Difficulty is renewed by what we
meet with in <hi>Exod. 12. 40. The sojourning of the
Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>who dwelt in</hi> Egypt (the last emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Place of their sojourning) <hi>was four hundred
and thirty Years.</hi> Here are thirty Years added to
the former Reckoning: how shall we reconcile
this? Very well, for this latter Account is precise
and exact, but the former was not, which is no
unusual thing in Holy Scripture, as well as in other
Good Writers. The Years are not always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
set down, the odd and lesser Numbers are
omitted, and the great round Number only is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
Thus in the forenamed Places the round
Number of four hundred is put for four hundred
and thirty, which latter is the whole time of the
sojourning both of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed in <hi>Canaan,</hi>
and afterwards of their Posterity in <hi>Egypt.</hi> This
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:46315:433"/>
Exact Number is mention'd by the Apostle, whose
Words will give us farther Light into this Compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
<hi>The Covenant,</hi> saith he, <hi>that was confirmed
before of God in Christ, the Law (which was four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirty Years after) cannot disanul.</hi> It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>the Covenant</hi> he here speaks of, is that
Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> (as the
preceding Verses shew) and <hi>the Law</hi> is that Body
of Moral Precepts and Prohibitions which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the very Year of the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
coming out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Hence we plainly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the beginning and ending of the four hundred
and thirty Years: they began when <hi>Abraham</hi> left
his own Country, (for then God entred into <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
with him) and they ended when the Israelites
left <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thereupon received the Law from
<hi>Moses</hi> on the Mount. Though it be true then that
the Israelites Servitude in <hi>Egypt</hi> was not above two
hundred and odd Years, yet the full time of their
whole Peregrination was four hundred and thirty,
which is to be reckon'd from the Calling of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and his coming out of <hi>Vr,</hi> until the Israelites
leaving of <hi>Egypt</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Moses.</hi> This
is the full and exact Account, and the other before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
fell short of it, because the odd Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
were omitted, as is frequent among the best
Writers. And indeed a great many <hi>Difficulties in
Chronology</hi> are answered by this, that a Great or
Round Number is oftentimes used in Scripture for
an Odd or Imperfect one, though it be more Exact.
Thus it is threatned and foretold in <hi>Numb,</hi> 14. 33.
that the Murmuring Israelites should wander in the
Wilderness <hi>forty Years:</hi> yet if you compare <hi>Numb,</hi>
33. 3. with <hi>Iosh.</hi> 4. 19. you will see that some Days,
if not Weeks, were wanting to make up the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
But because <hi>forty Years</hi> was a round and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:46315:434"/>
Number; and because in so many Years a few
Days were inconsiderable, therefore <hi>Moses</hi> delivers
it in this manner. The like you may observe in
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 11. 26. where you read that the Israelites
dwelt in the Land of the Amorites <hi>three hundred
Years;</hi> whereas from the first time that the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
began to enter upon the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>
(when <hi>Ioshua</hi> was made their Leader) to <hi>Iephthah</hi>'s
Reign, there were not above two hundred threescore
and seven Years. But becaue the other was a
Round Number, and because was nearer to three
hundred than to two hundred, it is thus express'd.
And other Instances of this sort might be produced,
(which I now wave) wherein the lesser and more
imperfect Numbers are omitted; especially in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Great Sums the small Number is neglected, and
comes not under any Account.</p>
                     <p>There is another difficult Passage in Chronology,
and that respects the time of the Judges, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.
20. <hi>After that he gave them Iudges about the space of
four hundred and fifty Years, until</hi> Samuel <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:</hi>
yet, according to the usual Computation, it
is generally said, that there were but three hundred
and thirty nine Years from <hi>Othniel</hi> the first Judg,
till the beginning of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Government, who
was the last: So that hence it appears there are
above a hundred Years too much in that Account.
<hi>Beza</hi> and some others lay the Fault on <hi>the Amanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ensis,</hi>
telling us, that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is written instead
of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>four hundred for three hundred.</hi> But
this Expedient for taking away the Difficulty is not
to be approved of, and I have given the Reason of
it before. Some think to help it by insisting on the
Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> in the Words, which signifies <hi>about,</hi> or
<hi>as it were,</hi> and so implies a Latitude in the Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy.
It is true, this shews that the time is not
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:46315:434"/>
punctually determined here: but then any Man may
see that the vast Difference between four hundred
and fifty, and three hundred thirty nine Years, is
not decided by this. <hi>Grotius</hi> on this Place tells us,
that the four hundred and fifty Years began from
the going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ended at the time
when <hi>David</hi> expell'd the Jebusites out of <hi>Sion;</hi> for
so long it was before the Jews were settled in that
Seat which God designed for them. But this doth
not in the least clear the Doubt, for St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s
Words are, <hi>After that, i. e.</hi> after <hi>the seven Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were destroyed, and the Land was divided by Lot to
the Israelites,</hi> as you read in the foregoing Verse.
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>after these things he gave them Iudges
about the space of,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore the Calculation
cannot commence from the going out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="bottom">Usher, Knatchbull.</note> Others, though of very great Learning, are yet
more extravagant, for they refer these Words to
those in <hi>ver.</hi> 17. of this Chapter, <hi>The God of this
People of</hi> Israel <hi>chose our Fathers;</hi> which was about
the Birth of <hi>Isaac,</hi> in whose Family the Covenant
was to rest. And they proceed to compute thus;
from <hi>Isaac</hi>'s Birth to that of <hi>Iacob</hi> sixty Years;
from thence to their going into <hi>Egypt</hi> one hundred
and thirty Years; from thence to their coming out
two hundred and ten; from thence to their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> forty; and from
thence to the Division of the Land, and settling
the Government by Judges, seven Years: in all
four hundred and forty seven. But besides that
this falls short three Years of the intended Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>viz.</hi> four hundred and fifty, this also is to be
said, that it is nothing to the purpose, for the
Text we are treating of speaks of the <hi>Time of the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:46315:435"/>
Iudges;</hi> but these Interpreters run back as far as
<hi>Isaac</hi>'s <hi>Birth,</hi> which was above four hundred Years
before there were any Judges.</p>
                     <p>In the next Place therefore, This and only this
can reconcile the Difference, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apostle
follows the Ordinary and Vulgar Accompt in use
among the Jewish People, who made the Number
of Years from the coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> till the
building of the Temple to be about an hundred
and twelve more than is express'd in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 1.
as appears from <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who makes the Distance
between the one and the other to be five hundred
and ninety two Years; the which Enlarging of the
Accompt arose from their computing the Years of
the <hi>Oppressions</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> between the times of the
Judges, as distinct from the Years which are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to each particular Judg. The Apostle, who
intended not Accuracy in Chronology, but spoke
as the Vulgar, follows this Computation; and by
putting the Sum of both these together, <hi>viz.</hi> the
Years under the <hi>Iudges</hi> and under the <hi>Oppressors,</hi>
he makes up the just Number of four hundred and
fifty Years; particularly thus, he joins with the
three hundred and thirty nine Years of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Judges, one hundred and eleven Years in
which the Israelites were in Trouble and Servitude
under several Enemies; which Years are numbred
in the History by themselves, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 3. 8. &amp; 3. 14.
&amp; 4. 3. &amp; 6. 1. &amp; 10. 8. &amp; 13. 1. Now these
being added to, or included in three hundred and
thirty nine Years of the Judges, make up exactly
four hundred and fifty Years.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>the forty Years Reign of</hi> Saul, which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by the Apostle in the next Verse, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.
21. <hi>God gave unto them</hi> Saul <hi>by the space of forty
years,</hi> it may seem very hard to reconcile it with
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:46315:435"/>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 1. where <hi>Saul</hi>'s Reign seems to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
within <hi>three Years;</hi> some think <hi>within two
Years.</hi> I answer, that Place is misunderstood, <hi>Saul
reigned one Year, and when he had reigned two Years
over</hi> Israel, <hi>he chose him three thousand Men,</hi> &amp;c.
Here is not assigned the full Term of Years in which
<hi>Saul</hi> reigned; but all that is meant is this, that at
that time when the <hi>Thunder in Harvest</hi> happened, (of
which you read in the preceding Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 18.
and to which the beginning of this Chapter, refers)
<hi>Saul</hi> had been King one Year, namely, since his
first anointing by <hi>Samuel,</hi> to his second anointing;
and that when he had reign'd another Year, or
two Years more, he chose him those three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Men to be his Guard. This is all that can be
gather'd from those Words, and therefore none
can infer thence that <hi>Saul</hi> reigned but three Years
in all. But still the greatest part of the Difficulty
remains; for though <hi>Saul</hi> reigned more than three
Years, yet it is impossible he should have reigned
<hi>forty,</hi> which is the Space of time that the Apostle
here assigneth him: for if he was King so long, it
would certainly follow that there were almost five
hundred Years from the Departure out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to
the building of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple: neither could
<hi>Saul</hi> be a <hi>young Man</hi> when he was elected King (as
we read he was:) nay, it would follow that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
was not born at that time when he is said to
have vanquish'd <hi>Goliah:</hi> and other such Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
might be drawn thence. How then did
<hi>Saul</hi> reign <hi>forty Years?</hi> I answer, this may truly be
said, because with <hi>Saul</hi>'s Government <hi>Samuel</hi>'s also
is computed in this Place of the Apostle. How this
forty Years is to be divided betwixt them is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Antiq. Jud. l. 6. c. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus</hi> comes pretty near to the space
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:46315:436"/>
of Time mentioned here, asserting that <hi>Saul</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
eighteen Years with <hi>Samuel,</hi> and twenry Years
afterwards. An<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Abraham Cowley <hi>in his</hi> Davideis.</note> Ingenious Man of late hath so
adjusted the time, that he concludes <hi>Saul</hi> to have
reigned ten Years of this forty, and he allows the
remaining thirty for the Government of <hi>Samuel.</hi>
Others make up the forty Years between them in
another manner. But all is Conjecture, and we
know nothing certainly here. This only we may
rest in as a very great Probability, that the times
both of <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi>'s Government are joined
together in these <hi>forty years. Samuel</hi> was Judg of
<hi>Israel,</hi> and being set over them by God, was their
rightful Governour. They had no Authority to
depose him, and to choose a King in his room, and
therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> might be look'd upon as their
True and Lawful Governour as long as he lived.
Yet this time of his Rule is made here a part of
<hi>Saul</hi>'s Reign, because he was forced at last to anoint
him King, and because he suffered his own Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be swallowed of his. Hence it is that the
<hi>forty Years</hi> assigned to him by St. <hi>Paul</hi> do include
<hi>Samuel</hi>'s Judicature, that is, <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forty Years together.</p>
                     <p>This also will salve many Chronological Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
that the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> did often make
their Sons Kings in their own Reign, to settle
them in the Kingdom before their Death; and so
the time of the Reign is sometimes set down as it
respects the Father only, sometimes as it respects
the Son, and sometimes as it includes both. <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>
is said to have reigned <hi>eight years</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem,
2 Kings</hi> 8. 17. but by Collection out of the Text it
is clear that either seven of those eight Years, or
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:46315:436"/>
at least four, are to be reckoned in the Life of his
Father <hi>Iehosaphat;</hi> for <hi>Iehoram</hi> reign'd as Vice-roy
in his Father's time, or he reigned with his Father,
and so his Father's Years and his are reckoned too.
But when, upon the Death of his Father, he came
to reign alone, then 'tis said, Jehoram <hi>his Son reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his stead,</hi> 2 Chron. 21. 1. So <hi>Iotham</hi> reigned
<hi>Sixteen Years,</hi> 2 Kings 15. 33. yet mention was
made before of his <hi>twentieth year,</hi> ver. 30. which
we reconcile thus, <hi>Iotham</hi> reigned alone sixteen
Years only, but with his Father <hi>Vzziah</hi> (who was
a <hi>Leper,</hi> and therefore unfit for the sole Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
four Years before, which makes twenty.
Thus we take away that seeming Repugnancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 24. 8. Jehoiachin <hi>was eighteen Years
old when he began to reign,</hi> and 2 <hi>Chron. 36. 9. He
was eight Years old when he began to reign:</hi> that is, he
was eight Years old when he began to reign with
his Father, but he was eighteen when he began to
reign by himself. It was common both with the
Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> to take their Sons into
Partnership with them in the Throne. This is the
way of resolving other Places of the like Nature
in the Books of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles.</hi> Sometimes
the Sons are made Kings with their Fathers, and
the Years of their Joint Reign are put together:
At other times they are spoken of as ruling sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately;
and hence it comes to pass that the Years
vary. We are concern'd then to take notice that
in the foresaid Books the Reigns of some Kings are
mentioned twice; first as they were Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Sharers with some others; and then as they
ruled alone.</p>
                     <p>We may sometimes solve the Doubts about the
different Account which is given us of the Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some Kings Reigns by <hi>Interregnums</hi> or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:46315:437"/>
of Kingly Government for few or more
Years, which was not unusual. Thus of King <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah,</hi>
who succeeded <hi>Iehoram</hi> in the Throne, it is
recorded (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 26.) that <hi>he was two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years old when he began to reign:</hi> but in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
22. 2. it is said, <hi>he was forty and two Years old when
he began to reign.</hi> If this latter Account be true,
then besides that it is a contradicting of the former,
it will follow hence that the Son was two Years
older than the Father; for of <hi>Iehoram,</hi> who was
his Father, it is said in 2 <hi>Chron. 21. 20. Thirty and
two Years old was he when he began to reign, and he
reign'd in</hi> Jerusalem <hi>eight Years:</hi> whence it appears
that he was forty Years old when he died: but of
his Son who succeeded him in the Throne it is
said, <hi>He was two and forty Years old when he began to
reign, 2 Chron.</hi> 22. 1. This is thought to be so
great a Difficulty, that <hi>Malvenda</hi> and others cry
out, it is not to be solved. But why, I pray? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
say they, according to this Relation the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
died at forty; and the Son, who immediately
succeeded him, was above forty: so then <hi>Iehoram</hi>
begat his Son two Years before himself was born;
which to assert, is as ridiculous as the thing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
But those who talk after this manner
make Difficulties, and then complain there is no
possibility of answering them. They affirm that
<hi>Ahaziah</hi> immediately succeeded <hi>Iehoram;</hi> whereas
they find not this asserted in the History. There
might be an Interruption of the Royal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Ahaziah</hi> might be kept from the actual Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the Throne a long time. So then it is
truly said, <hi>He was two and twenty Years old when he
began to reign,</hi> if you reckon from his Father's
Death, for then a King's Heir is said to begin his
Reign. But if you compute from the time when
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:46315:437"/>
he was peaceably settled in the Kingdom, <hi>he was
two and forty Years old when he began to reign:</hi> for by
that time he got securely to the Throne, twenty
Years were expired: and after this he reigned but
<hi>one Year,</hi> as we read in the same Place. Thus (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that it might have been said, that <hi>Ahaziah</hi>
reigned with his Father twenty two Years) the
Difficulty is answer'd by supposing an <hi>Interregnum</hi>
for several Years, which was very frequent in those
Days: and there is Reason Sometimes to grant this
<hi>Vacancy</hi> to have been, although it be not expresly
mention'd in the Place; for many things of this
kind are omitted in the Sacred History, and are
left to be inferr'd from the Reasonableness of the
thing it self, and from the Circumstances which
attend it.</p>
                     <p>Again, there are those who avoid some Scruples
in <hi>Chronology,</hi> by holding that the Years of Bad
Kings are sometimes omitted, as if they had not
reigned at all. So some have interpreted that
Place, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 1. which speaks of the <hi>two Years
Reign of</hi> Saul; not but that he reign'd many more,
which are not there reckon'd, because of his evil
Government. Thus <hi>Solomon,</hi> they say, reigned
many more Years than are set down, for the time
of his sinful and idolatrous Reign is suppressed.
Lastly, it hath been observed (in order to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away those Doubts which arise about the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Assignation of Time in the Old Testament)
that the Scripture gives us the Computation of
the Times of the <hi>Iewish Republick</hi> or <hi>Kingdom,</hi> but
altogether omits the Spaces of <hi>Servitude, Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Captivity,</hi> and <hi>Anarchy,</hi> excepting only the
time of the Egyptian Bondage, which is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
by <hi>Moses.</hi> The Author of <hi>Seder Olam,</hi> and
Other Jewish Writers, and the Learned <hi>Brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>

performed this Task, adding several things
of his own Observation, whereby the Differences
in Chronology are fully reconciled. The Result then
of what we have said is this, that if in some Places
of Scripture the Years seem not to be rightly set
down, we may recur to the foregoing Resolutions,
and satisfy our selves with them, but not condemn
the Text as corrupted and falsified; nay, as if it
had had Mistakes and Errors in it at the first. This
latter is Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s way, but we may plainly see
that he makes it his Business to expose the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to represent it as a Book fraught with
many Inconsistencies and Falsities. If he had dealt
thus with <hi>Virgil</hi> or some other Writer of that
strain, if he had impeach'd that Poet's Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
in making <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Dido</hi> contemporary, it
had been tolerable, yea laudable, for some are of
Opinion that <hi>Dido</hi> was not in being till above a
hundred and fifty Years after <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s Death. It
was high Poetical Fiction to make that Queen fall
in love with the fugitive Trojan so long a time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was dead. But in the Sacred Writings there
is nothing that looks like such Defect in Synchro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism:
both Time and Place are truly assigned,
though sometimes by reason of the things before
mentioned we cannot presently discover the Truth
of it, and make it appear how it is.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, I conclude all with those <hi>Genealogical
Difficulties</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. and <hi>Luke</hi> 3. I begin with our
Saviour's <hi>Genealogy,</hi> as 'tis drawn up in the first
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:46315:438"/>
Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi> Here some Heretick
Christians of old, (as the <hi>Ebionites</hi> and <hi>Manichees</hi>)
here some of the Notablest Pagans (as <hi>Celsus, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
and <hi>Porphyrius</hi>) found Matter of Cavil; and
some of late have thought that here are such Knots
as are impossible to be dissolved. As first, the
Genealogy runs thus in <hi>ver. 9. Ozias begat Ioa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham;</hi>
whereas 'tis clear from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3. 11, 12.
that <hi>Ioash, Amaziah,</hi> and <hi>Azariah,</hi> were between
<hi>Ozias</hi> and <hi>Ioatham.</hi> The Answer is, that this
Genealogist reckons sometimes <hi>per saltum:</hi> when
he saith such a Person <hi>begat</hi> another, it is not always
meant of Father and Son properly, but he is said
to <hi>beget</hi> another from whom that Person or others
proceed at a distance. An immediate Generation
(such as the Father's is in respect of his Son) is not
to be understood in this Place, nor indeed in some
others in this Genealogy, where you cannot but
observe that sundry Persons are wholly omitted.
It is evident therefore that the Design of St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>
was not to be strict and accurate in this Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and to give us a compleat Enumeration of
Persons, but only to present us with a general and
loose Draught of Christ's Descent. And this
should teach us not to be over-curious in scanning
the Parts of this <hi>Genealogy;</hi> for if the Evangelist
was not Critical and Exact in composing it, why
should we shew our selves so in examining it?</p>
                     <p>Again, 'tis objected that the Genealogy is said
to be divided into <hi>three Fourteens,</hi> and yet in one of
them there are only thirteen Persons to be found.
This is solved by some <hi>Manuscripts,</hi> which insert
<hi>Iachim</hi> into <hi>ver.</hi> 11. thus, Josias <hi>begat</hi> Jachim, <hi>and</hi>
Jachim <hi>begat</hi> Jechoniah: and others interpose <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
in <hi>ver.</hi> 13. as thus, Eliakim <hi>begat</hi> Abner, <hi>and</hi>
Abner <hi>begat</hi> Azor. But there is no need of flying
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:46315:439"/>
to <hi>Other Copies</hi> in this case; for the plain Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Difficulty is this, that in <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one Name, <hi>viz. Iechonias,</hi> two Persons, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Father and the Son are understood: for that
<hi>Iechonias,</hi> mention'd in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. had two Names,
and was called <hi>Iehoiakim</hi> (as you read in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
3. 15, 16.) who was the Father of that <hi>Iechonias</hi>
mention'd in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. The first <hi>Iechonias</hi> was the
Son of <hi>Iosias,</hi> the second was the Father of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiel,</hi>
and the Son of the former <hi>Iechonias.</hi> Now
if the former <hi>Iechonias,</hi> the Father of the latter,
be numbred in the second <hi>Tesseradecad;</hi> and if the
latter <hi>Iechonias,</hi> the Father of <hi>Salathiel,</hi> be inserted
into the third <hi>Tesseradecad;</hi> or, which is the same
thing, if the Father be meant in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and the
Son in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. the Difficulty vanisheth; for here
are <hi>thrice fourteen Generations,</hi> according to this way
which I have propounded. And the way is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and easy, and cannot seem strange to any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who observes the manner of the Lineages in
this Genealogy, which are not set down with Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy,
but something is left to be supplied by us
in the several Branches of it, and particularly in
this which I last mention'd. But it is further Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
how could <hi>Iechonias beget Salathiel,</hi> (v. 12.)
when 'tis said concerning him, <hi>Write ye this Man
childless,</hi> Jer. 22. 30? If <hi>Iechonias</hi> was childless,
<hi>Salathiel</hi> could not be his Son. But I answer,
1 <hi>st. [Childless]</hi> may import no other than this,
that he should be <hi>bare, Solitary, desolate, distressed,</hi>
as the <hi>Greek</hi> renders it, and as the next Words may
be thought to explain it [<hi>a Man that shall not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
in his Days</hi>]. Or, <hi>2dly.</hi> the meaning is, that
<hi>Iechonias</hi>'s Children should be cut off, and not one
of them succeed him in the Throne, as is said like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife
in the following Words, [<hi>No Man of his Seed
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:46315:439"/>
shall prosper, sitting upon the Throne of</hi> David, <hi>and
ruling any more in</hi> Judah. This is here to be <hi>child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less:</hi>
and so though <hi>Iechoniah</hi> had a Son, <hi>viz. Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiel,</hi>
yet this Son was not his Successor in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <p>Then, as to the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of Christ from <hi>Ioseph</hi>
upwards, which we have in <hi>Luke</hi> 3. it is Objected,
that <hi>Cainan</hi> is inserted between <hi>Arphaxad</hi> and <hi>Sala,
ver.</hi> 36. but is not so in <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 12. where these
Generations are first recorded. I answer, <hi>Cainan</hi>
is omitted by <hi>Moses</hi> for Brevity sake, and <hi>Arphaxad</hi>
is said to beget <hi>Salah,</hi> that is, not immediately,
but <hi>Cainan</hi> intervening. But what was left out in the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Text the <hi>Septuagint</hi> supplied, who in their
Greek Version expresly mention <hi>Cainan:</hi> and St.
<hi>Luke</hi> following this Version put <hi>Cainan</hi> into the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy.
And it was better to do so than to alter
it according to the Hebrew Original, because the
LXX's Version was in great Repute: and if he had
alter'd it, it would have given Offence to the
Weak. Besides, this might be by Tradition among
the Jews, (as St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> 2 Tim.
3. 8.) and that gave farther Occasion to him of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting
it, though it was not in the Hebrew.</p>
                     <p>But how can either of these <hi>Genealogies</hi> (in St.
<hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi>) be said to be <hi>Christ's,</hi> when
they both give an Account only of the Lineage of
<hi>Ioseph?</hi> To satisfy this Scruple we must know that
the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s Genealogy is included in that of
<hi>Ioseph,</hi> and consequently <hi>Christ's Descent</hi> is here set
down because he sprang from the <hi>Virgin Mary.
Ioseph</hi> being a Good Man, and an Observer of the
Law, would not marry one that was not of his
Tribe or Family; so that <hi>Mary</hi>'s Genealogy is in a
manner his, because she was of the same Family and
Stock with him: which is partly intimated in the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:46315:440"/>
Close of that Genealogy which is in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
ver. 16. Jacob <hi>begat</hi> Joseph <hi>the Husband of</hi> Mary;
giving us to understand that <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Ioseph</hi> were
of the same Family and Descent, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Stock
and Lineage of <hi>David;</hi> for according to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saick
Law and Custom one Tribe and Generation
did not mix with another, but they were to match
together: wherefore in giving the Pedigree of one,
that of the other also is given at the same time.
Hence Christ is call'd <hi>the Son of</hi> David, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 1.
and in other Places; not that he was so in respect
of an Earthly Father, for he had none, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of his Mother, who was of the House of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
So then the Genealogy of <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>
is to be reckon'd as the same, and that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why one of them only, <hi>viz. Ioseph,</hi> is distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentioned.</p>
                     <p>And yet you may observe a very <hi>Great Difference</hi>
in the Genealogies of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke;</hi>
and one may be said to be <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s and the other
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Genealogy; that is, those Persons from
whom more <hi>immediately Ioseph</hi> descended, are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by the former Evangelist, and those from
whom more directly <hi>Mary</hi> descended, are menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
by the latter. St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Genealogy gives
<hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Pedigree from the House of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and
St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s gives the Blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s from the
House of <hi>Nathan.</hi> The one, saith St.<note n="*" place="bottom">Comment. in S. Matth.</note> 
                        <hi>Hilary,</hi>
sets down the Royal Stock of Christ by <hi>Solomon;</hi>
the other shews his Priestly Lineage by <hi>Nathan.
Grotius</hi> speaks more consistently, telling us, that
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> takes notice of the Right <hi>Succession</hi> in
his Genealogy, but St. <hi>Luke</hi> hath regard to the
Right of <hi>Consanguinity.</hi> The short is, we have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:46315:440"/>
Christ's Genealogy, not only as it respects his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Father, but his Own Mother. <hi>Matthew</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Jew, doth, according to the Legal way, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Line of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the supposed Father of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.
<hi>Luke</hi> being a Gentile, follows the Law of
Nature, and writeth <hi>Mary</hi>'s Descent, from whom
(being his Mother) Christ really came. And yet
after all this, and much more which hath plausibly
and probably been said by Writers on this Subject,
we are certain of this, that both St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and
St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Genealogy derive Christ's Line from <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph.</hi>
We find that both of them terminate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
in Him. <hi>Iacob begat Ioseph,</hi> saith St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
ver. 16. and so ends the Descent. St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
who reckons another way, yet makes the lineal
Descent of Christ from <hi>Ioseph, Iesus being (as was
supposed) the Son of</hi> Joseph, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 23. This we
must assert, and we can't do otherwise, because
the thing is so plain before us, that he that runs may
read it in express terms. Moreover, this was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the constant Custom of the Jews, who
always deduced the Pedigree from the Father: and
we know that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was our Saviour's reputed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But then you will say, if both the Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
belong to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> what is the reason that they
differ so much? Whence is it that the same Names
and Persons are not mentioned in one that are in
the other, if they be the same Genealogy? This
Query hath been warmly pursued, and divers An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
have been return'd to it. But the true one
is this, that where there were so many Names and
Persons, the Evangelists might pitch on whom
they pleased. It being their Design only to draw
up a Pedigree in a desultory way, and not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
all from whom our Saviour descended, it was
in their choice to take who they thought fit, either
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:46315:441"/>
Persons nearer or further off; they might insist on
this or the other Stock as they saw convenient. It
is no wonder then that the Names and Number of
the Persons in the two Genealogies vary, for St.
<hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> proceed in a different way,
and derive the Pedigree from distinct Stocks.
This is the true reason why there is so great a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the two Genealogies; why the Persons
whence the Lineage is drawn, are not the same in
both the Evangelists. Yet it evidently appears
from both ways of framing the lineal Descent,
that our Lord sprang from the <hi>House of David,</hi>
which was the main thing designed and aimed at in
these Genealogies. Now, this is effectually done
by propounding of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s <hi>Descent:</hi> for seeing no
<hi>Genealogies</hi> were reckon'd among the Jews by the
Woman's side; and seeing the Pedigrees of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were not wont to be <hi>recorded</hi> among them, (no
more than their <hi>Age;</hi> whence the only Woman
whose Years of her whole Life are recorded in
Scripture is <hi>Sarah,</hi> Gen 23. 1.) it is manifest that
when <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Lineage is set down, that also of his
Wife, and consequently of her Son, is set down
also: Which is grounded on what I said before
<hi>viz.</hi> that the Jews generally married within their
Tribes, that the Inheritances might be preserved
in the same Tribe they were in, and not be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated
to another. The Injunction was plain and
positive, <hi>Numb. 36. 6. To the Family of the Tribe of
their Father shall they marry:</hi> and though afterwards
a <hi>Special</hi> Reason is given, <hi>viz.</hi> because the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
should not be alienated, yet the Injunction
was General, and concern'd both Rich and Poor;
and though there be some Examples of a contrary
Practice in the Sacred History, yet we cannot
thence argue that the Law was not General. Yea,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:46315:441"/>
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Masters tell us, that the Woman, after
the Contract of Marriage, though she was before by
her Family of another Tribe and Lineage, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from her Husband, yet by virtue of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
she was adopted into the same Tribe with
him to whom she was espoused, and so was ever
after legally reckon'd to be of that Tribe: and
the Progeny which afterwards was born of this
Woman, was accounted to be of the same Tribe.
Thus it is plain that when <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s <hi>Lineage</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by the Evangelists, that also of the Blessed
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and of our <hi>Lord</hi> himself is determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
We have reason then to assert this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the Pedigrees mentioned by St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
and St. <hi>Luke,</hi> are both of them properly the Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies
of <hi>Ioseph:</hi> Which I find most Writers on
this Theme are loth to acknowledg; yea, they tell
us positively, that one is <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s, and the other is
the Virgin's Genealogy. But if we will make use
of our Eyes, and behold and read the Pedigrees
themselves as they are delivered by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
we must be forced to confess that <hi>Ioseph</hi> is in
the beginning of the Genealogy in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> and in
the end of that other in St. <hi>Matthew;</hi> only in this
the one differs from the other, that the former
reckons <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Lineage upward, and the latter
downward. But this is common to them both,
that in the Line of Progenitors which they set
down, they skip over many Persons; and when
this or the other Person was the <hi>Son</hi> of such an one,
'tis sometimes meant, that at <hi>a great Distance</hi> he
was his <hi>Son,</hi> or rather his <hi>Kinsman,</hi> as the Hebrews
use the word <hi>Son.</hi> If we take but this one thing
along with us in our perusing of these Pedigrees,
it will help us to go through most of the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
we meet with in them: and this you will find
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:46315:442"/>
made use of to this purpose by those that have
travell'd with great Industry in this Point, and
have undertaken to solve the hard Passages in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Genealogies.</p>
                     <p>If it be Objected in the last Place, How can <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
be the Son of <hi>Iacob</hi> in one Genealogy, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.
16. and the Son of <hi>Heli</hi> in the other, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 23.
it is answer'd by some, that because <hi>Ioseph</hi> married
<hi>Mary, Heli</hi>'s Daughter, therefore he is call'd his

Others say, <hi>Heli</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> were Brethren, and the
former dying without Children, the latter marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Widow, as the Law in that case required:
So that <hi>Iacob</hi> was the Natural Father of <hi>Ioseph,</hi>
and <hi>Heli</hi> was his Father-in-law. This is the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of several of the<note n="*" place="bottom">Jul. African. Greg. Nazianz. Auguslin, Jerom, Eusebius, Ambrose.</note> Antients and<note n="†" place="bottom">Baronius, Jansenius, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </note> Moderns,
and we have no Argument to confute it. This
was a Tradition among the Jews themselves, as
you may see in <hi>Grotius</hi> on <hi>Luke</hi> 3. Or if this be not
satisfactory, we may quash the Difficulty by what I
have formerly propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> that 'tis usual
among the Jews to have two Names. It may be
<hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Heli</hi> are Names of the same Person; and
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> makes use of one, and St. <hi>Luke</hi> of the
other. To conclude, though we were not able to
reconcile some Passages in the foresaid <hi>Genealogies,</hi>
yet we have no reason to take occasion thence to
question the Truth and Consistency of them, for
'tis ridiculous to think that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this Genealogy, and in the very Entrance of
his Gospel, unless he knew it was true, and as to
the main unexceptionable. And the very same we
may say of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> who without doubt would
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:46315:442"/>
not have offer'd to publick View a Pedigree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Chiefest of that Nation were concern'd, if
he had not been assured that it was impossible to
confute it. And suppose we are not able to give
an Account of some part of it, yet let that of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
be thought of, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Jews had a way of
drawing up Genealogies, which is as to some things
unknown to us: they reckoned the Generations in
a manner that was different from what is now in
use.</p>
                     <p>So much touching the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of the Stile of
Holy Scripture, and the <hi>Occasions</hi> of them. No

contain in it some things hard to be understood,
if he ever we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in this Discourse, and if he consider moreover,
that,</p>
                     <p>1. The Scriptures are <hi>a Collection of Different
Writers,</hi> some of which leave out those Passages
which others put in, and upon that account there
seems sometimes to be a Discrepancy among them,
and one is thought to assert that which another
seems to deny.</p>
                     <p>2. We are ignorant of many Particulars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the <hi>Names</hi> of things, to <hi>Rites, Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Customs, Proverbs</hi> and peculiar Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of those Times of which the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
speak: and this is another Reason why seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things in them are obscure and unintelligible.
We read of <hi>the Synagogue of the Libertines,</hi> Acts 6.

by <hi>Iews</hi> that were <hi>made free of</hi> Rome, or from a

                        <hi>Fr. Iunius</hi> observes, <hi>Labratha</hi> was the old Word
for a <hi>Synagogue</hi> or <hi>School</hi>) no Man can tell: For we
must needs be ignorant of the true occasion of
Words and Things, if there be no particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
concerning them. How were it possible to
understand the Psalmist's Complaint, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 83.
<hi>I am become like a Bottle in the Smoke,</hi> if we had not
read that Antiently the Eastern People used to hang
up the Skins, of which Bottles were made, in the
Smoke, to dry and harden them? Besides, if they
were long hung up in the Fire or Smoke, they
were subject to be parched and shriveled. I am
dried up and wither'd like such a <hi>Bottle,</hi> saith he.
We could not reach the Sense of those other
Words of his, <hi>The Rod of the Wicked shall not rest on
the Lot of the Righteous,</hi> Psal. 125. 3. which is an
Allusion to the dividing of the Lands among the
Jews, if we did not know that the <hi>Rod</hi> or Staff was
used in <hi>Sortition,</hi> the assigning of Land or Ground
by <hi>Lot.</hi> Again, let not the Reader be surprized
when I add, that it may be when St. <hi>Paul</hi> orders

2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13. he means the <hi>Skins</hi> which he was to
make use of in his Trade of Tent-making: For he
was brought up to a Trade, (as was usual in those
Days, and in those Eastern Countries) and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to this, as we read in <hi>Acts.</hi> 18. 3. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when at other times he acquaints us that he
<hi>labour'd with his Hands,</hi> it is not to be question'd
that he means his working in this Calling in which
he was skill'd, and was bred up to. And this
questionless was a considerable Employment, and
sufficiently gainful, because there was great use of
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:46315:443"/>
                        <hi>Tents</hi> and <hi>Booths</hi> in those open and hot Countries:
and they were much bought up by those whose
Employment was in the Fields, especially they were
useful for Souldiers. Now the great Materials
which were used in this Occupation, were <hi>Skins</hi> or
<hi>Hides</hi> of Beasts dress'd. Accordingly we read that
the Covering of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of <hi>Testimony</hi> was
made of <hi>Skins,</hi> Exod. 35. 23. Yea, <hi>Skins</hi> are sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and absolutely put for <hi>Tents</hi> or <hi>Tabernacles</hi> in
these following Places and others, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 2.

<hi>Ierignah</hi> is constantly rendred <hi>Pellis</hi> by the <hi>Latin In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter,</hi>
because the Tents were made of Skins.
And that <hi>Tents</hi> and <hi>Pavilions</hi> were made of these,
we may sufficiently inform our selves from Pagan
History. This we learn from <hi>Q. Curtius,</hi> who tells
us, that<note n="*" place="bottom">Soepe pellibus tabernaculi allevatis, ut conspiceres hostium ignes. Hist. lib. 7.</note> such kind of Membranous Tents were
used in <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great's Camp. And<note n="†" place="bottom">Tentoria militum erant ex pellibus, &amp;c. De gest. Alex. M. l. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianus</hi>
is very positive in this Matter. These Tents
of Skins or Hides were not only among the <hi>Greeks</hi>
but <hi>Romans,</hi> and both<note n="‖" place="bottom">Decad. 1. lib. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Livy</hi> and<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 1. cap 12.</note>

                        <hi>Caesar</hi> mentions
this sort of Tents, and<note n="‖" place="bottom">Lib. 8. cap. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> tells
us, that those Souldiers who behaved themselves
amiss, had this as part of their Punishment, <hi>nè ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium
ex pellibus haberent,</hi> they were not suffer'd
to lie in these Tents in the Field. Hence in <hi>Tully</hi>
we shall find, that<note n="‖‖" place="bottom">4 Acad.</note> 
                        <hi>sub pellibus esse,</hi> is to be safely
entrenched, and lie secure in their Tents. It is
probable that St. <hi>Paul</hi> sent to <hi>Timothy</hi> to bring or
convey to him these <hi>Skins</hi> wherewith he made his
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:46315:444"/>
                        <hi>Tents,</hi> and at that time especially when he was in
Bonds at <hi>Rome,</hi> (the time of his writing this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
and had no other way to gain a Livelihood,
than by exercising himself in his Calling. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he writes to his beloved <hi>Timothy,</hi> to send him
not only his <hi>Cloak</hi> and his <hi>Books,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>chiefly,
especially</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, his <hi>Skins</hi> for Tent-making,
which he most of all wanted at that time: for he
was unwilling to be burdensom, and to rely wholly
on the Charity of the Christian Brethren. These
were some choice Skins which he had left behind
him at <hi>Troas,</hi> when he wrought in this his Trade
there. And if it be objected that <hi>Troas</hi> was a great
way off, the Answer is, that they might as easily
be brought to him as the <hi>Books</hi> he writ for, if these
were of any considerable Number and Bigness.
And this Notion is yet more probable, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was in way of Contempt call'd
by the Pagans <gap reason="foreign">

the foresaid Titles, thereby to magnify the Grace

                        <hi>Ierom.</hi> This
makes it not improbable that the fore-mention'd
Text hath reference to the Practice of those times,
the making of Tents, or the covering of Booths
and Pavilions with Skins. These, it is likely, are
the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of. As he sends for

sends for the <hi>Skins</hi> (which he left behind him) to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:46315:444"/>
make Tents to shelter and keep others warm. For
though it is granted that one Signification of <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brana</hi>
is <hi>Parchment,</hi> of which I had occasion to speak
before; yet it also signifies the <hi>Vppermost Skin or
Hide</hi> of any Creature, as appears from that of
<note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Lucretius;</hi>
                        <q>Membranas mittunt vituli de corpore summo.</q>
And it hath its Denomination from <hi>Membrum,</hi>
saith<note n="†" place="bottom">Voss. Etymolog.</note> 
                        <hi>Priscian,</hi> because it covers the Limbs and
other external Parts. Nay, you must note that
this is the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>most proper</hi> Signification of the
word <hi>Membrana</hi> in <hi>Tully, Pliny,</hi> and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors:
whereas afterwards in a <hi>secondary</hi> Sense it
came to signify <hi>Parchment.</hi> These things may
render my Interpretation of this Place not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.
However, I presumed to offer the Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism
on the Word, and let the Learned entertain
it as they please. But this is not to be question'd,
that the not attending to the Usages and Practices
of old in the Countries to which some things spoken
of in Scripture belong, is one Reason why we miss
of the right Sense of some Places.</p>
                     <p>3. The Hebrew Text (which is the greater part
of the Bible) hath some things proper to it self,
which render it perplex'd and obscure in some
Places, for in Hebrew there are no <hi>Moods</hi> in the
Verbs but the <hi>Indicative</hi> and <hi>Insinitive:</hi> no <hi>Tenses</hi>
but the <hi>Past</hi> and <hi>Future, Participles</hi> being made use of
to express the Present Time, which oftentimes
renders the Meaning obscure and intricate. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of an <hi>Interrogative</hi> Point the Hebrews make
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:46315:445"/>
use of their Interrogative <hi>He;</hi> otherwise there are
no <hi>Notes</hi> or <hi>Marks</hi> of Interrogation, which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cause (as might be shew'd) of misunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Text sometimes. There are frequent <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheses</hi>
in the Hebrew Bible, and if they be not
diligently observed, they mar the Sense, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
but in one Place at present, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 3, &amp;c.
The <hi>3d, 4th</hi> and <hi>5th</hi> Verses are a <hi>Parenthesis;</hi> you
must join the <hi>6th</hi> Verse to the <hi>2d,</hi> and then you
will see how the word <hi>for</hi> in the <hi>6th</hi> Verse comes
in, not otherwise. But there are no <hi>Marks</hi> or
<hi>Characters</hi> whereby we may know when there is
such a <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> which cannot but trouble the
Sense very much, and confound the Meaning of
the Place, unless it be with extraordinary Care
taken notice of. And I might add, that the <hi>Pauses</hi>
and <hi>Periods</hi> in the Hebrew Copies are not so distinct
as might be wished. The greater ought our Care
and Diligence to be in perusing and studying this
Holy Book.</p>
                     <p>4. It is the way of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> (and indeed of
all the <hi>Eastern</hi> Writers) to express things in a
<hi>brief</hi> and <hi>concise</hi> manner, which renders the Place
sometimes dark and confused. In the <hi>second Psalm</hi>
several Persons are introduced speaking, but it is
not in the least intimated that there is this Change
of Persons, but all is express'd in a short and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous
way. The whole Psalm is a <hi>Dialogue,</hi>
wherein the <hi>Church</hi> speaks, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. then the <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
of the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 3. the <hi>Church</hi> again, <hi>V.</hi> 4, 5.
then <hi>God,</hi> ver. 6. then <hi>Christ</hi> the Son of God,
<hi>ver.</hi> 7, 8, 9. And lastly the Psalmist ends with his
own Exhortation. All which Parts, if we do not
take notice of, (though they are not distinguish'd
for Brevity sake) the true Import and Scope of
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:46315:445"/>
the Psalm are lost. It is common to recite Words
which are said by Persons, and yet to bring them
in abruptly, and not to signify that they are said or
spoken by them. As in <hi>Psal. 22. 8. He trusted in
the Lord, i. e.</hi> they <hi>said</hi> so: but this is not here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd.
Thus in <hi>Isa. 33. 14. Who among us,</hi> &amp;c.
i. e. <hi>the Sinners in</hi> Zion, mentioned in that Verse,
<hi>said</hi> those Words. In <hi>v. 18. where is the Scribe?</hi> &amp;c.
to make the Sense perfect you must insert, <hi>thou
shalt say.</hi> So in <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 24. these Words [<hi>say the
Enemies</hi>] must be inserted. In <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 4. these or
such like Words are left out [<hi>the Enemy shall say</hi>].
The like is observable in <hi>Ier. 22. 28. ch.</hi> 31. 20.
In <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 15. the word [<hi>saying</hi>] is necessarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
for the first Verse of the next Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the Words which were to be <hi>said.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
this is supplied by the Translation, though
it be not in the Hebrew, as in 2 <hi>Sam. 2. Isa.</hi> 64.
11. But in <hi>Obadiah,</hi> ver. 1. before <hi>Arise ye</hi> the
word <hi>saying</hi> is to be supposed. In 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15. 45.
<hi>but</hi> is left out: otherwise you can't understand the
Apostle. And many other Words are omitted in
the Old and New Testament, and ought to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by the diligent Reader, who on that account
is obliged to be very Attentive when he reads these
Sacred Writigs, for their short and contracted way
of speaking makes them the less intelligible;
whereas when Matters are amplified by Words,
they become more clear and plain.</p>
                     <p>5. There is in the Hebrew Language a certain
<hi>Peculiar Idiom</hi> or Force of Signification, which
when it comes to be translated into another
Tongue, is wholly lost; at least a great part of its
Vigour and Elegancy is taken away; and at the
same time it is not so well understood, because it is
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:46315:446"/>
a Strange Idiom, and no ways agreeable to our
manner of expressing our selves.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Time</hi> are not always observ'd in
these Holy Writings, which too often begets
Mistakes. Upon these several Accounts, and
others, there must needs be some <hi>Obscurity</hi> and
<hi>Difficulty</hi> in the Stile of Holy Writ. But you may
observe that this happens, through the All-wise Providence of God, in those Places where the
Great and Momentous things of Religion are not
concern'd, where the Grand Truths of the Law
and the Gospel are not in the least endanger'd.
And when in other Parts of the Bible we meet
with Hard and Dark Passages, we ought to be so
far from blaming and disparaging this Divine
Book, because of these, that we should rather
reckon them an Ornament to it. The Dubiousness
of Scripture in some things is part of its Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
It is a great Commendation of this Sacred
Volume, that it is not destitute of Abs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rusities
and Difficulties; that we are not wholly tied up and
confined in our Interpretation of it; that there is
a Freedom of Disquisition allowed us; that in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Places every Man is at his Liberty to imbrace
what Sense he pleaseth of the Words, so it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Analogy of Faith, and the Tenour
of the other Parts of this Inspired Book. This
gives us an opportunity of exciting our Care, of
exerting our Industry, of improving our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
of enlarging our Faculties by continual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searches
and Examinations. Thus the Obscurity
of some Parts of Scripture is of great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Use. But then where-ever the Indispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Necessary Points of Faith and Manners
are treated of in these Writings, their Stile is
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:46315:446"/>
sufficiently clear and plain, and the Matter which
is express'd by it is easy to be understood. In
brief, the Scripture is plain where it should be
so. But if in some other Places there be Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
and Perplexity, if some Texts seem to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and clash with one another, let us remember
this, that the Scriptures were inspired by the Holy
Ghost, and therefore there can be no real Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Repugnancies in them, because Truth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
contradict it self. By impartial Study and
Enquiry let us dive into the Meaning of these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Writings, and by the Helps which I have
tendred in the foregoing Discourse, endeavour to
reconcile those Places which seem to differ: but
let us never be so daring as to accuse the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which were endited by God himself, of
Contradiction.</p>

                  <head>TO THE
Most Reverend Father in God,
His Grace
THOMAS
Lord Archbishop of Canterbury,
Primate and Metropolitan of all England;
and one of his Majesties most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Privy Council.</head>
                  <opener>May it please Your Grace;</opener>
                  <p>I Imbrace this welcome Opportunity
of congratulating Your late Access
to the Highest Station in our
Church, which all Wise and Good Men
look upon as an Happy Omen of the
future Felicity of these Realms. For in
Your Grace conspire all those things
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:46315:452"/>
which can render us, by the Divine
Blessing, a Prosperous People, <hi>viz.</hi>
Your unstained Faithfulness and Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to his Majesty, Your most Ardent
Love to Your Country, Your Great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
for Publick Counsels and Affairs,
Your perfect Abhorrence of all Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
and Debauchery, Your Zealous
Concern for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
in that for the whole Protestant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Of this last You have afforded
the World such an Illustrious Proof as
will give an immortal Reputation to
Your Name. For you have not only
with Your Learned Pen encountred the
<hi>Idolatry of the Church of</hi> Rome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vindicated the <hi>Reformed</hi> Cause, but in
all Your Actions You have demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Your singular Care for this latter,
and Your Detestation of the former.
Especially, when in the late Reign this
Idol began to be set up again, and too
many fell down to it, You with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Zeal, Vigour and Courage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
against this Practice. You
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:46315:452"/>
bore the Insolencies and Insults of the
Enemy with an unimitable Bravery;
You withstood their Boldness with a
Confidence becoming the Goodness of
Your Cause: You obviated their Folly
and Madness with a profound Wisdom
and Prudence: You defeated their Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
by a more unwearied Industry:
And, in brief, You were the Successful
Maul and Scourge of the Hectoring Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
that lifted up their Heads in that
Day. For this You were hated and
defamed, and are so at this Hour, by
all the sworn Friends to the Pontifician
Interest, who look upon You (and that
justly) as their most Dreadful Enemy.
But this very thing deservedly makes
Your Grace to be loved, admired and
honoured by all Sincere <hi>Protestants</hi> and
True <hi>English</hi> -men.</p>
                  <p>I am one that glory in being of that
Number, and accordingly I now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to express my infinite Regards
and Veneration of Your Grace's Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
Undertakings in behalf of our
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:46315:453"/>
Religion and our Church, and of the
Whole Nation. And, as a Testimony
of my Resentments and Duty, I here
offer to Your Grace <hi>a Discourse of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> which was
designed to be presented to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
before you were advanced to this

called You. Wherefore I having <hi>then</hi>
consecrated it to Your Name, I hold it
unlawful <hi>now</hi> to alienate it; especially
it being the Choicest and Noblest Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that I have yet treated of, and
therefore I hope not unworthy of Your
Grace's Patronage. I submit the Work

                     <hi>I</hi> Now present the Reader with that Part of
my Discourses concerning the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
wherein I have attempted to display
the matchless <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of those
Divine Records. Besides the Great and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Remarks which I have offer'd, I could have
mention'd other things barely <hi>Critical;</hi> and
which, though they be of an inferiour Nature in
comparison of those which I have insisted upon,
are deemed to be <hi>Excellencies</hi> and <hi>Embelish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
in other Authors of good Rank. Thus
some Criticks have observed concerning that of
<hi>Virgil, Aen.</hi> 8.

The Poetick Feet are so form'd that they express
those of the Steeds. And so in the same Writer,
<hi>Aen.</hi> 5.—<hi>Procumbit humi bos,</hi> is thoght to

Instance the very Noise of the Words, the
very Composure of the Syllables, are justly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded

I could have observ'd in the Inspired Writings,
especially those that are Poetical, among which I
reckon the Book of <hi>Isaiah</hi> to be one; for tho it be
not in Verse, yet a Poetick Genius and Strain may
be observ'd in most Parts of it. Those Words,

Preparations made for <hi>Babylon's</hi> Fall. They are
so order'd that the Quickness of the Dispatch is
signified by them. There are six Parts or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in this Verse without a Copulative, meerly
to signify the Celerity of the Vndertaking. And
the Vision wherein this Speedy Ruine of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is foretold is thus represented, <hi>v. 7. He
saw a Chariot, a couple of Horsemen, a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
of Asses, a Chariot of Camels.</hi> There is
Expedition in the very Words, there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive
Particle to retard them. You may in the
very Frame of the Words perceive the Chariots
running speedily. But if we look into those Parts
of the Bible which are strictly and properly <hi>Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
that is, which consist of certain Measures and
Numbers, we shall find Examples of this sort ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
frequently. The Egyptians furious Pursuit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Israelites is thus express'd in <hi>Moses</hi>'s
Song, <hi>Exod. 15. 9. I will pursue, I will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,</hi>
&amp;c. Where there are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ix Verbs denoting
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:46315:454"/>
Action and Expedition, and not one Conjunction
between them. In the Conciseness and Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Words, especially if we consult the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,
which is more Emphatick, we may discern
the Speediness of the thing it self spoken of. The
like might be taken notice of in the Song of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah,</hi>
Iudg. 5. and in several Places of the
<hi>Psalms,</hi> and the <hi>Lamentations.</hi> Thus, if we
would be very Curious, we might parallel the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Poetry with that of the best Masters in
that Art among the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>But because these things are but mean in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of those Weightier ones wherein the <hi>Bible's
Excellency</hi> doth appear, I have not inserted
them, or any other Observations of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
into the ensuing Discourse; and the rather,
because it was my Design to mention only those
Particulars which are of Vniversal Vse, and
which may without Exception be acceptable to all
Persons who have a due Esteem either of <hi>True
Learning</hi> or <hi>Piety.</hi> Those who value the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and are well acquainted with it, will most
readily give their Suffrage here, and proclaim to
the World that <hi>Scripture-Learning</hi> outvies all
others, that the Original of most Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
is to be fetch'd hence, that a Library with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Bible is an imperfect thing. Those who
have a Sense of the latter will be as forward to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert
the Preheminence of this Sacred Volume,
for here is the Source of all <hi>Religion;</hi> and no
Man can be Devout and Pious who is a Stranger
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:46315:455"/>
to this. Wherefore when, with a becoming Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret,
I saw that the Sense of Religion and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is generally lost among us at this Day, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
that the best way to retrieve it, is to read
and peruse the Scriptures: And that this may be
done with Success I thought it requisite to set forth
the <hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of this Holy
Book, that thence Persons might be effectually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to acquaint themselves with it. And I
hope, how meanly soever I have performed this
Task, some who light upon these Papers will from
them be inspired with a hearty Regard and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
an entire Love and Veneration of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Writ, and be reminded from what is here sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,
to converse more intimately with it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and to encourage others to follow their
Example. This would in a short time make a
great Change in the World, and the Bible it self
would be read in the Lives and Behaviour of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
Wherefore with great Seriousness and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
I request the Reader that he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
such Thoughts and Perswasions as these,
that <hi>Bible-Learning</hi> is the Highest Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that this Book is the most Valuable of any
upon Earth, that here is a Library in on single
Volume, that this alone is sufficient for us, tho
all the Libraries and Books in the World were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
And this is the Grand Truth which I
have laboured to demonstrate in the following Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</p>

of some Hebrew Words is another Cause:
sometimes the <hi>Sense</hi> rather than the <hi>Word</hi> it self is
attended to: Some Faults are to be attributed to the
<hi>Transcribers:</hi> Some, because the <hi>LXX</hi> are <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasts</hi>
rather than <hi>Translators;</hi> they take the liberty
to insert Words and Passages of their own. The Greek
Version hath been designedly corrupted in several
Places. Why the Apostles in their Sermons and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
made use of this Version, though it was faulty.
Sometimes the Sacred Writers keep close to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Text, and take no notice of the <hi>Seventy's</hi>
Translation of the Words. At other times in their
Quotations they confine themselves to neither, but use
a Latitude. The Greek Version is to be read with

Discourse briefly propounded. The Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are the perfect Rule of Faith. They are the
best Conduct of our Lives and Actions. They are
the only Ground of solid Consolation, Joy and
Happiness. This Perfection of Scripture is opposed
by many of the Rabbins. An Account of their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bala
and Oral Law. The Papists by preferring
their Traditions before the Scriptures, and by indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to keep these latter in an unknown Tongue,
deny the Perfection of them. So do Familists,
Quakers, and all Enthusiasts.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT may be observed that the Minds of Men
have been differently disposed as to the choice
of the <hi>Authors</hi> they would read; and their
Esteem and Value of them have been as vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
It hath been usual for Persons to express a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46315:462"/>
particular Kindness for one Writer above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Thus <hi>Homer</hi> of old was excessively magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by those famous Warriors <hi>Agesilaus</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Great:</hi> The former read him continually at
home and in the Camp, and whenever he had any
time to spare for Reading: The latter could not
sleep without his <hi>Iliads</hi> under his Pillow. <hi>Scipio,</hi>

<hi>Institution of Cyrus,</hi> and was always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
it, and valued it at a high rate. So among
Christians, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was a great Admirer of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian;</hi>
and when he had a mind to read him, his
usual Saying was, Give me my Master. <hi>Charles</hi>
the Great was hugely taken with St. <hi>Augustine de
Civitate Dei,</hi> and had it constantly read to him,
yea even at Supper. King <hi>Alphonsus</hi> in all his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions,
and at all other times, carried <hi>Iulius
Caesar</hi>'s <hi>Commentaries,</hi> others say <hi>Livy</hi>'s <hi>History,</hi>
with him. <hi>Theodore Gaza</hi> gave his Vote for <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>'s
<hi>Works,</hi> and was so pleased with them, that
he protested if he could have but one Man's Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
he would certainly choose His before all
others. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> was no less in love with
St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> on St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and expressed his
high Esteem of him by saying, he preferr'd him
before the goodly City of <hi>Paris. Charles</hi> the V<hi>th</hi>
gave a greater Deference to <hi>Comines</hi> than to any
other Writer, and perpetually conversed with
him. <hi>Scaliger</hi> would rather be the Author of the
ninth Ode of <hi>Horace</hi> than be Emperor of <hi>Germany.</hi>
And to come down yet lower, <hi>Grotius</hi> gives <hi>Cuja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi>

on the Imperial Laws. <hi>Salmasius</hi> admired no Divine
so much as <hi>Calvin,</hi> and particularly preferred his
<hi>Institutions.</hi> And the Reverend Mr. <hi>B. Oley</hi> tells us,
if he were to be con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Antientest Writer extant in the World.

of Words, and with greater Variety of Stile than
any other Writers can afford them. Here is a Book
where more is understood than expressed, where
Words are few, but the Sense is full and redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.
No Books equal This in <hi>Authority,</hi> because

                        </gap>ls all other Writings in
the Excellency of its <hi>Matter,</hi> which is the Highest,
Noblest, and Worthiest, and of the Greatest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
to Mankind. Lastly, (to name no more at
present, that I may not anticipate what is intended
in the following Discourse) the Scriptures tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46315:463"/>
all other Writings in their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Efficacy.</hi>
This<note n="2" place="bottom">Psal. 19. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Word of God is pure, enlightning the Eyes,</hi> ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiating
Mens Minds with Supernatural Truth,
affecting their Hearts and Consciences, subduing
the Refracotriness of their Wills, transforming
their Lives, and changing them into other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
Thence it is that all Men of well-disposed
Souls find a plain Differene between their reading
This and other Books. When they read those, it
is true they are something affected and pleased, the
Stile or the Matter give them some Satisfaction;
but if they read them often, and confine themselves
to them, their former Pleasure and Satisfaction
abate, and the Authors seem not to be so entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and acceptable as they were before, and at
length they become burdensom and nauseous; and
hence it is that some Writers grow out of fashion,
and other New ones are called for. But it is far
otherwise with this Holy Book: the Affection and
Pleasure which you feel in the reading it are lasting
and durable, because this Blessed Word sinks down
into the Center of the Soul, and is always present
with it. Though you lay this Book aside, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
take it up, and do so again and again, yea
never so often, you will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ind it grow worse,
but much better, <hi>i. e.</hi> it will yield you greater De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and Satisfaction; and the oftner you converse
with it, the more you will discern the Worth of it,
yea the more pleasing will the very Words and
Syllables of these Divine Writings be to you. For
what the Great Critick observes of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Poem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that there is a certain kind of Peculiar Easiness
and Sliding in his Verse, which are not to be found
in any other Poets, is eminently true of the Holy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46315:463"/>
Scriptures, if compared with other Authors: there
is a peculiar Sweetness, a matchless Softness and
Pleasantness in the Stile of these Holy Books; the
Words as well as the Matter are Winning and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing,
and all pure and sanctified Minds have a
clear Perception of this, yea the clearer, because
they so frequently converse with these Inspired
Writers. We may then on this Account, as well
as on others, challenge the World to shew us where
there is any Book like this, where there is any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
comparable to it. In all Humane Writers
there is something wanting, something imperfect;
but in this Sacred Volume there are all things, and
every thing here is compleat. To the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
therefore all other Writings must vail, to
this Best of Books they must all submit, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
their Meanness and Inferiority.</p>
                     <p>Hence it was that the Wisest and Best Men (as
we may observe) did always extol the Scriptures.

that is, <hi>in Knowledg, Righteousness and true Holiness,
Col. 3. 10. Eph.</hi> 4. 24. And we are told in these Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Writings, how Man lost this Image, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferably
defaced and corrupted his Nature, <hi>viz.</hi>
by listning to the Temptation of Satan, and by
wilful disobeying the Divine Command. Here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
we are informed, that all Flesh is desiled and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
by this Transgression of our First Parents in
Paradise, and that their Sin is become the Sin of
All Mankind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. Hence we learn more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
that the Merciful Creator, out of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and boundless Philanthropy, vouchsafed to
promise, that <hi>the seed of the Woman,</hi> the Blessed
<hi>Iesus,</hi> who was to be born of a Virgin, should <hi>bruise

and the <hi>Church,</hi> which began with our Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
First Parents, and their Children; of whom
<hi>Abol</hi> was the Chief. Their first and early way of
expressing their Devotion and Religion, was by
<hi>Offerings</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> unto God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 4. To
which end, without doubt, they erected <hi>Altars,</hi>
though these are not mentioned till after the Flood,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 20. We are told at what time there was
established an Open and more Solemn worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of God, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Seth</hi>'s days; then it was
<hi>that Men began to call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi>
and to form a <hi>Visible Church,</hi> Gen. 4. 26. <hi>i. e.</hi> an
Orderly and Solemn Society of Men, gather'd and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46315:466"/>
chosen out as a peculiar People to serve God. For
as Men encreased, they began to embody themselves
into Communions, and to worship God more signal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and openly, and with a joint Consent. Here
(and no where else) we have an Account of the
Church's Progress and Increase, under the good
Patriarchs, <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. Here we are
informed what were the several Defections and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storations
of Religion in the first Ages. Here we
have an Account of the Erection of the <hi>Levitical</hi>
or <hi>Mosaick</hi> Service; the whole System of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Rites and Ceremonies, unto which the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Church was obliged. This yields abundant Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Contemplation and Enquiry to the Studious,
who will find that these Observances were institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after the Israelites had been a while in the
Wilderness, and had shew'd themselves inclinable
to commit Idolatry. Then it was that God by
<hi>Moses</hi> gave them these Laws, and prescribed
them these Usages, which he knew would be the
best Antidote against the Idolatrous Practices of
the Nations that were round about them. And
withal, if we look into these Ceremonies with a
discerning Eye, we shall see that they had a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
End, and were Presignifications of the great
and wonderful Transactions of the Evangelical
Dispensation, that they obscurely pointed unto the
Messias, and his Blessed Undertakings for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of Mankind. They were Forerunners
and Harbingers of the <hi>Blessed Child Iesus,</hi> that
<hi>Child that was to be born,</hi> that <hi>Son who was to be given,</hi>
and <hi>on whose shoulders</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> was to be

and the Inestimable Worth of this Healing
and Saving us, are the main Subject of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Writings: where we are taught likewise,
that this Salvation is Free and Undeserved, and
founded on the Meer Grace and Bounty of God, and
is not the Acquist of any Merit and Worth in us.
<hi>We are justified freely by his Grace, through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
that is in Christ Iesus, whom God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ath set forth
to be a Propitiation for Sin, through Faith in his Blood,</hi>
Rom. 3. 24. And in the Evangelical History, we
are told, that this Blessed Redeemer, who laid
down his Life for us, took it up again, rising from
the Grave by the irresistible Power of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and after a few Days Ascended gloriously
into Heaven; from whence He shall come at the
last Day to call the whole World to an Account:
for <hi>He hath appointed a Day in which he will judg
the World in Righteousness.</hi> Then all the Dead shall
hasten out of their Dormitories, and stand before
that Great Tribunal, and receive Sentence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their past Behaviour.</p>
                     <p>These are some of the Grand Principles of our
Faith, these are the Fundamental Verities of our
Religion: and they are originally fetch'd from
this Sacred Volume, and are <hi>established</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
there, by unanswerable Arguments and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations.
Behold here the Eminency of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Notions,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46315:467"/>
see the Transcendency of these
Excellent Truths, which are contain'd in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!
Here are things of a higher Nature than
any Moral Writings afford us. These say nothing
of the Gracious Oeconomy of the Gospel, of the
Incarnation of the Son of God, of Satisfaction
made for Sins through the Blood of Christ, of
Justification by his Righteousness, and other the
like unparallell'd Discoveries, which are to be
learn'd out of Scripture only. In short, the Bible
is the Standard of all Notions, Propositions and
Articles in Religion: it is the Rule and Square of
all our Opinions, Discourses and Arguments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to Christianity; and all our Conceptions,
though they seem never so sine and plausible, are
of little worth and nse, unless they be regulated
according to This. If there arise any Disputes
and Controversies concerning Matters of Christian
Faith, This is the Judg that we must have recourse
to, or rather This is the Rule by which we are to
judg: for every Man is to judg and choose, and
the Rule whereby he is to guide his Judgment and
Choice is the Scripture. It is true, Reason or
Conscience is our Immediate Guide or Rule: but
then we must have a Mediate Rule; that is, a
Guide or Rule for our Reasons and Consciences,
and That in all Sacred and Religious things is the
Word of God, and That is the only Rule. By
This, and This alone, all Controversies of Faith
which are necessary to be decided, may, and
ought to be decided. And it is the Excellency
and Perfection of this Rule, that it is Infallible.
This is that <hi>more sure Word of Prophecy,</hi> which
St. <hi>Peter</hi> preferreth before <hi>Eye-Witnesses</hi> and <hi>Voices
from Heaven,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 16, &amp;c. Yea, <hi>though an
Angel from Heaven should preach any other Doctrine</hi>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:46315:468"/>
than what the Apostles preach'd, and afterwards
committed to Writing, St. <hi>Paul</hi> pronounceth him
<hi>accursed,</hi> Gal. 1. 8. These Infallible Records, these
undoubted Oracles of the Holy Ghost in Scripture,
are the standing Rule of Belief to all christians,
even to the End of the World. On this they may
rely with Confidence, as on an Unerring Guide;
for it is not like other Books which are made by
Men, and therefore are not void of Errors and
Mistakes; but the Author of it is God, who is
Truth it self, and can neither deceive, nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
Thus the Canonical Books of the Old
and New Testament, are the Compleat and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Rule of our <hi>Belief,</hi> and of all <hi>Supernatural
Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. They are the Perfect Rule of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi>
they contain all things to be Done as well as
to be Believed. Here is the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> the Sum
of all our Duty towards God and Man; and the
Necessary Precepts of Life, comprised in it, are
often repeated, enlarged upon, and explained,
through the whole Sacred Book. To these are
added the <hi>Evangelical</hi> Duties of Self-denial, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
Poverty of Spirit, Purity of Heart,
Brotherly Love, Heavenly-Mindedness, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
Walking, Redeeming the Time, Abstaining
from all appearance of Evil, Giving no Offence to
any, and many others of the like Nature. The
Writings of the Gospel forbid us to be Carnal,
Sensual and Earthly, and call upon us to converse
with Spiritual and Celestial Objects, to <hi>to set our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
on things Above,</hi> and to work our Minds to
such a Temper that we may <hi>desire to depart out of</hi>
this Body, and <hi>to be with Christ, which is far better</hi>
than groveling here below. And Christianity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes
this Heavenly-mindedness by giving us a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46315:468"/>
Power over Our selves, by restoring us to a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of our Bodily Appetites and Passions,
so that the Soul thereby becomes Pure and Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
purged from all mundane Dross and Filth,
fitted for Heavenly Joys, and therefore most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
breathes and longs after them. Here we
learn, that Christianity is repugnant in all things
to Satan's Kingdom, and designedly promotes the
Kingdom of God; it bids us not seek our selves,
and aim chiefly at worldly Respects, but it enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
us to Humble and Debase our selves, and to
Glorify God in all, to advance his Honour in the
World, and next to that, to look after the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our own and others immortal Souls
These are the Noble and Worthy Designs of
Christianity, and the Laws of it: their Business
is to take us off from those low and mean Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
which Men of the World carry on, and to
set the Soul of Man in a right Posture, and to fix
it on right Ends. The Christian Precepts reach
to the Hearts of Men, they restrain the secret
Thoughts and inward Motions of the Mind, they
curb the inordinate Desires and Wishes, they
temper the Affections and Passions, especially they
forbid Revenge, Malice, Hatred; and they direct
us to love God, and to bear Love to all Men for his
Sake. The Christian Laws give Rules for our
Words and Speeches, and will not allow them to
be Idle and Vain, much less Prophane and Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
but they command our Discourse to be <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with Grace, season'd with Salt,</hi> to favour of
Goodness and Piety, and to be for the Edifying
of those we converse with. The Commandments
of the Gospel do also govern the Outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our Lives, and bid us be <hi>Holy in all manner
of Conversation:</hi> They enjoin Chastity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46315:469"/>
Temperance and Sobriety; they forbid
Lust and Luxury, Pride and Sensuality: They
teach Courtesy, Affability, Meekness, Candour,
Gentleness towards our Brethren: They bid us be
Kind and Charitable to all, and even to love our
Enemies. Christianity is a Religion that is exactly
Just, and gives the strictest Rules of dealing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
and Uprightly with our Neighbours. Even
Morality, which is the very Foundation and
Ground-work of All Religions, is most Illustrious
here. Christianity hath the Impress of Reason,
Civility, and all Acceptable Qualities. It forbids
nothing that is Fitting and Decorous, it counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
all that is Manly and Generous, it is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Law of Nature and the Reason of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
In these Sacred Writings the Duty of
Christians is set down not only as they are Single,
but as they stand in relation to others, and as they
are Members of the Community. There are Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Lessons for Persons in every Condition, for
Husbands and Wives, for Masters and Servants,
for Parents and Children, for Superiours, Equals
and Inferiours. They are all provided here with
Instructions and Directions proper to that State
they are in. They are very Remarkable Words

Business in <hi>Christendom</hi> this Day on foot, but
have a Ruled Cafe in Scripture for their Issue and
Success.</q> This is a Great Truth, and is no mean
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46315:469"/>
Demonstration of the Excellency of these Holy
Writings which I am speaking of.</p>
                     <p>Here are also the most Notable Instances of all
those Vertues and Graces which adorn the Life of
Man. Here is the Example of <hi>Abel</hi>'s sincere and
acceptable Devotion; of <hi>Enoch</hi>'s walking with
God; of <hi>Noah</hi>'s untainted Faithfulness amidst the
Temptations of the corrupt World; of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Self-denial,</hi> when he offered his only Son
on the Altar; of <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s <hi>Resolved Chastity,</hi> when he
once and again resisted the lustful Solicitations of
his Mistress. Here is the Example of <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Spirit,</hi> who desired his Name might be blotted
out of the Book of Life rather than that Nation
should perish. Here you read of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s submissive
Silence; of <hi>Reuben</hi>'s fraternal Commiseration; of
<hi>Rohab</hi>'s <hi>Seasonable Wisdom,</hi> which was the Effect of
her Faith, in concealing the Spies that were
search'd for. Here we may observe <hi>Phineas</hi>'s <hi>Active
Zeal; Eli</hi>'s <hi>Entire Submission</hi> to the Divine Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
<hi>Iob</hi>'s <hi>Invincible Patience; Iosiah</hi>'s <hi>Early Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
his and <hi>Iehosaphat</hi>'s <hi>Care to reform the Church;
Ionathan</hi>'s entire Friendship; <hi>Manasses</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Repentance; <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>'s Austerity; the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion's
Faith; <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Charity to his Enemies at
his Death. Briefly, here is commemorated the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
and Holy Demeanour of all Ranks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Persons, whether in Prosperity or Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity;
whether in Youth, Manhood, or Old Age,
or in whatsoever Condition of Life they were
placed. Where can we find such glorious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements
as the Sacred History recounts unto
us? Where are there such Perfect Paterns of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue?
Where do you meet with such Noble Acts as
some of the Holy Patriarchs, Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
are celebrated for? The Great Heroes spoken
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46315:470"/>
of in the Writings of the Pagans are generally
but Ideas of Vertue, and a kind of Harmless Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
to preach Goodness to Men. <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Aene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
Xenophon</hi>'s <hi>Cyrus, Curtius</hi>'s <hi>Alexander, Plinty</hi>'s
<hi>Trajan,</hi> are rather Ingenious Portraictures and
Images of Worthy Princes than Real Characters of
them. They represent rather what they should be
than what they are. They imitate some Limners
who study not to draw the Face exactly like that of
the Person they are to pourtray; so they make it
Fair, they think it is enough. But the Sacred
Writers have not done so, they have no ways flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
or misrepresented the Originals they drew.
They have set them before us in their proper Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
native Lineaments, and genuine Colours.
What we read of the Worthies mention'd in the
Bible, is Certainly True, and Real Matter of Fact.
Such was their Incomparable Spirit, that they <hi>did</hi>
braver and greater Actions than Others ever
<hi>thought of,</hi> witness the matchless Valour, Fortitude
and Conduct of <hi>Ioshua, Iephthah, Gideon,</hi> yea of
those Masculine Women <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Iael;</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
all the Other Eminent Instances of Heroick
Undertakings in the Sacred Records; witness those
Exact Paterns, those Accurate Examples of the
rest of the Vertues which we read of these. And
to illustrate and set off these, there are added very
Signal and Memorable Examples of all sorts of
Vices, as of <hi>Cain</hi>'s <hi>Persidious Murdering</hi> his Brother,
<hi>Laban</hi>'s <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude, Esau</hi>'s <hi>unruly Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
Reuben</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi>'s Incest, <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s impious
Obstinacy, <hi>Abimelech</hi>'s unnatural Cruelty to his
Brethren, <hi>Dinah</hi>'s wanton gadding, <hi>Amnon</hi>'s Rape,
<hi>Achitophel</hi>'s evil Policy, <hi>Shimei's</hi> Railing, <hi>Haman's</hi>
revengeful Pride, <hi>Rabshakeh</hi>'s Blasphemy, <hi>Belshaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>'s
sacrilegious Debauchery. <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Wife is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46315:470"/>
an Example of the Impudence and Outragiousness
of Lust when it is repulsed; <hi>Eli</hi> is an Instance of
Fond Indulgence to his Children; <hi>Absalom, Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophel,
Sheba</hi> and <hi>Zimri,</hi> of Treason and Rebellion;
<hi>Samson</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> of an <hi>Vndue Love of Women:</hi>
And in the New Testament the Hypocrisy of the
Pharisees, the Treachery of <hi>Iudas,</hi> the Timorous
Compliance of <hi>Pilate,</hi> the Malice of the Jews
against our Saviour, the Apostacy of <hi>Demas,</hi> the
Ambition of <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> are notorious. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
other Examples there are of all manner
of Immorality and Wickedness.</p>
                     <p>And with these are mixed the most Signal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of the <hi>Punishment of Vice,</hi> and the <hi>Reward
of Vertue.</hi> Here are abundant Proofs of God's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
Severity and Vengeance against profligate
Offenders; and here are as frequent Tokens and
Assurances of the Divine Love and Kindness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
those that lead a holy and religious Life.
Here are set before us the most Conspicuous Acts
of God's Providence in reference both to Bad Men
and Good, that by the former we may be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
yea deterred from continuing in the ways
of Vice, and that by the latter we may be incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
yea as 'twere bribed to be Vertuous and
Good. Here we may observe and admire God's
Wonderful Care of his Servants in all Ages of the
World; and here we may take notice of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of those Evils and Miseries which he inflicteth
on those who wilfully decline his Service, and give
themselves up to their Lusts. There are no where
such Eminent Examples of this Nature to be found
as these which we meet with in the Sacred Volume
of the Bible. No other Writings can produce
such Remarkable Discoveries of God's Will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Men, and of his Dealings with them:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46315:471"/>
Wherefore These must needs be the Best Conduct
of our Lives and Actions, the Best Reformers of
our Ways and Manners: Which is the Meaning of
the Psalmist in <hi>Psa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>. 1 19. 9. Wherewith shall a young
Man cleanse his way? By taking heed thereto, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to thy Word,</hi> i. e. by making the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
his Rule, and by adjusting all his Actions to
it. If the <hi>Youthful</hi> and <hi>Passionate</hi> Sinner may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
and reformed by attending to God's Word,
and that only the Pentateuch or the Laws of <hi>Moses</hi>
(for this was all the Inspired Scripture extant at
that time, which we certainly know of) then we
cannot despair of the Success and happy Influence
of the whole Body of the Scriptures upon Others.
It will throughly change and amend their Lives by
making a full Discovery to them of all their Lusts
and evil Affections, by representing Sin to them in
its own native Desormity, and by setting before
them the Beauties and Excellencies of a Religious
Life, by being a Faithful Monitor and Guide to
them whenever they undertake any thing, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them the true Boundaries of Good and Evil,
and by directing them how to accomplish the one,
and to avoid the other. The Sum of all is, that
these Inspired Writings acquaint us with the
Whole Will of God, whether it refers to our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
or to our Practice, and consequently that not
only our Faith, but our Manners are to be regulated
by this Holy Book. Especially by the Principles
and Laws of the <hi>New Testament</hi> they will more
conspicuously be exalted, and all Righteousness
and Godliness more visibly promoted in our Lives.
For here is the most Perfect and Consummate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar
of Holiness; in the Evangelical Writings
the Blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> still speaks and lives: In these
you may hear what he said, and see what he did,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46315:471"/>
and know how you are to conform your Lives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to His. Whence you have Reason to infer,
that as these Writings are the Compleat Canon of
our Faith, so they are the Adequate Rule of our
Actions.</p>
                     <p>Nay, although we should suppose some Mistakes
in them by the Fault of <hi>Transcribers,</hi>(which yet
no Man can certainly prove, nay it is not by any
means to be allowed, and therefore it is the most
culpable thing in Sir <hi>N. Knatchbull,</hi> that he is seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
times finding Faults in the Transcribers of the
<hi>New Testament,</hi> which if we once grant, we bid
farewel to the Certainty of Scripture: But if we
should, I say, <hi>suppose</hi> some Slips in the Copying out
of the Books, yet) still they retain the same Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
because those supposed Mistakes are not of
Moment, and belong not to Faith or Manners.
Neither do the <hi>Obscurity</hi> or <hi>Difficulty</hi> of Scripture
hinder it from being our Rule, because all the
Matters in it which relate to our Salvation, are clear
and easy. For when I say it is an Adequate Rule
of Faith and Manners, the Meaning is, that it is
so as to such Matters of Faith and Manners as are
<hi>Necessary</hi> to be believed and practised by us. Now
nothing is <hi>Necessary</hi> but what is absolutely requisite
to our Salvation. This then is the thing which
we maintain, that the Scriptures contain in them
either in express Terms, or by just Consequence,
all things to be asserted and done by us in order to
our being Saved. The Reason of which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
namely, because the End for which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were written was this, to direct us how to be
Saved. This is the grand Design of it, and
therefore there must be in it all things that
are requisite to this great End and Design.
Which is expressed thus in the Words of Our
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46315:472"/>
Church,<note n="1" place="bottom">Article the <hi>6th,</hi> viz. <hi>of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <q>Holy Scripture containeth all things
necessary to Salvation; so that whatsoever is
not read therein, nor may be proved thereby,
is not to be required of any Man, that it should
be believed as an Article of the Faith, or be
thought requisite or necessary to Salvation.</q> And
this is a sufficient and solid Proof of a thing's not
being Necessary to Salvation, that it is not contain'd
in Scripture. This then we assert, that these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
are Plain and Perfect as to all Matters that are
Necessary, and accordingly are able to put an End
to all Controversies which relate to Salvation:
And if Men will not end them with This Rule,
they will never do it with any. This is the Chief
Perfection of Scripture, that in it the whole Will
of God, as to those things that have a necessary
Tendency to our Happiness, and consequently are
the only Necessary Things to be known and done
by us, is plainly revealed. The <hi>New Testament</hi>
particularly is the last Revelation of God's Will
and Counsel, and nothing is to be added to it or
taken from it, which makes it a Perfect Standard
of Belief, and a Compleat Rule of our Lives, in
which there is nothing short and defective, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
superfluous and redundant. Here are all the
Principles of True Religion, and all the Measures
of Holy Living: so that whilst we proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Perfect Canon, we are infallibly
certain of the Truth of what we believe, and of
the Rectitude and Lawfulness of what we act. On
this sole Account the Holy Writ excels all Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
in the World besides.</p>

3. We are to adjoin this, that as it is a Light
to our <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> and a Rule of our <hi>Lives,</hi>
so it is the grand Procurer of our <hi>Comfort, Ioy</hi>
and <hi>Tranquillity.</hi> Alas, they are Cold Topicks of
Consolation which the Writings of the Best Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralists
afford us. When our outward Distresses
and Miseries, much more when our inward and
spiritual Maladies increase upon us, <hi>Epictetus</hi> and
<hi>Seneca,</hi> with all their Spangled Sayings, are too
mean Physicians to take us in Hand. The Great
<hi>Cicero,</hi> when in the Close of his Life he was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to marvelous Difficulties, declared that his
Learning and his Books, afforded him not any
Considerable Arguments of Comfort; that the
Disease of his Mind, which he lay under was<note n="1" place="bottom">Imbecillior est Medicina quam Morbus, <hi>Epist,</hi> 16. ad Attic. <hi>Lib.</hi> 10.</note> too
great, and too strong to be cured by those Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Medicines which Philosophy administred to
him. There must be some greater Traumatick,
some more powerful Application to these Wounds
to work a perfect Cure. And this Divine Book
is able to furnish us with it. This alone can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
our Pains and Languors, and restore us to
an entire Health.<note n="2" place="bottom">Psal. 119. 50.</note>

If but a small part of the Bible had this
blessed Effect, how powerful and successful will
All of it prove, if we duly consult it, seriously
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46315:473"/>

Hearts? If the Apostle could say,<note n="1" place="bottom">Rom. 15. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Whatsoever
things were written asore time</hi> in this Book, <hi>were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for our Learning, that we through Patience and
Comfort of the scriptures might have Hope,</hi> how much
greater Hope must needs be administred to us, in
all Conditions of Life, but more especially in the
Day of Trouble and Calamity, when we have the
Scriptures, not only of the Old but New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to repair unto? This latter especially will
be a never-falling Spring of Contentment and Joy
to us. In these Books we have a true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Landskip and View of the World: Here is
unmask'd and laid open the Vanity of it. Here
we are assured that many of the Gay things which
it presents us with, and which fond Minds so dote
upon, are but empty Bubbles, deceitful Phantoms
and Apparitions, mere Conceits and Castles in
the Air. Here we are inform'd that a Prosperous
State is not really Good, that an Overplus of
Riches and Worldly Abundance does frequently
prove a Clog to vertuous Minds, and that Excess
of Pleasures is too fulsom and luscious, and takes
away that purer Relish of spiritual and heavenly
Delights; yea, that Men generally find a worse
Effect of them: for when they are gorged and
clogg'd with them, they revolt from God; <hi>when
they are waxen fat, they kick</hi> against Heaven. So
their Worldly Plenty is turn'd into the worst of
Punishments, and this <hi>Plethory</hi> is their Disease
On the other side, we are taught in these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
that Crosses and Afflictions are not evil in
themselves, yea, that they are Good and Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and advance our spiritual Health; that they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46315:473"/>
are so far from being a hindrance to our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that they are a part of it, for otherwise the
Afflicted would not be so often pronounced<note n="1" place="bottom">Job. 5. 17. Psal. 94. 12. Prov. 3. 11. Matth. 5. 10. 11. Acts 14. 22. R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Magnifying
of him,</hi> and <hi>setting his Heart upon him.</hi> It shews,
that God is greatly concern'd for his Good, and
that the Almighty hath more care of him than
he hath of himself. Here we are instructed that
we have ground to suspect our Condition, if we
be wholly exempted from the Distresses of this
Life; and that not to be Chastised is a Mark of
<hi>Bastardy.</hi> Here we learn the true use and end of
all those Adverse Dispensations which we meet
with, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were designed to try us, to
make us know our selves, and to inform us how
evil and bitter a thing it is to offend the Divine
Majesty; to awaken us out of our Sloth and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
to hold us in Action, to keep us in Breath
and Exercise, as <hi>Carthage</hi> was useful to rouze
<hi>Rome</hi>'s Valour; to abate our Pride and Haughtiness,
and make us humble and submissive Creatures; to
check our immoderate Passions and Pursuits after
earthly things; to disintangle us from these
Snares, to free us from these Charms, to keep us
from being suck'd in, and swallowed up in the
powerful <hi>Circle</hi> and <hi>Eddy</hi> of this World; as who
knows not that it is True Philosophy that the
<hi>World</hi> is made up of <hi>Vortices?</hi> to cause us to look
after Better Things when these are taken from
us, to reclaim us from our evil Courses, and
to reduce us unto Vertue and Goodness; to excite
us to a Renunciation of all Trust and Confidence
in our selves, and the transitory Enjoyments of this
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46315:474"/>
World, and to depend upon God alone. It is
this Book whence we are acquainted that our Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
make us conformable to Christ our Master,
and therefore are Honourable Badges of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:
That the Curse which usually attends out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Crosses, is taken away by our Saviour's
Death: That the Calamities of the Faithful are
Chastisements, rather than Punishments: That
no Adverse Accidents can do us any hurt, if we
believe in Jesus, and abandon our Sins: That the
Pressures of this Life are serviceable to make us
pity those that are in Misery, to know and relish
the Love of Christ in suffering for us, to inhanse
the Comforts of a Good Conscience, to commend
the Favour of God to us, to prepare us for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and to increase the Happiness of it. Thus
the Scriptures reconcile our Minds to those Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments,
Dangers and Calamities, which are
our Allotment in this World; thus they allay the
evil Spirit of Discontent, they effectually cast out
and vanquish those Legions of Impatient and
Tumultuous Thoughts, which are the frequent
Attendants of Adversity: They assure us that
these Afflictive Dealings of Heaven towards us,
are intended for our real Advantage; that they
are the greatest Kindness and Favour that can be
shew'd us; that they are undeniable Tokens of
Divine Love; and in brief, that Good Men are
happier in their worst Circumstances, than others
are, or can be, in their greatest worldly Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Upon these rational Grounds, the Holy
Scriptures become the most effectual Anodynes to
take away, or at least to mitigate all our Pains and
Sorrows. They successfully remove all those Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings
and Discontents which russle and imbroil
the Soul, they quash and defeat all those trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46315:474"/>
Passions which embarass and plague the
Mind. By the help of these Divine Instructions
which the Holy Writ affords us, we are enabled
to encounter the greatest Evils, with courage and
bravery to receive the Shock, to weather the
Storm, to bear all the Insolencies and Insults of
our Enemies, to break through all Difficulties, to
have Peace within though we find none without,
to keep a Sabbath in our own Breasts, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
our selves with the Serenades of a Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
This is the <hi>Patience and Comfort of the
Scriptures,</hi> and no Writings in the World can bless
us with them but these.</p>
                     <p>And indeed this necessarily follows from those
foregoing Assertions, <hi>viz,</hi> that Scripture is a
Perfect Rule of Faith, and also of Manners. As it is
the former, it is a sure Basis for us to rest upon:
<hi>we know whom we have believed,</hi> and so we are fixed
and determined; which doth effectually contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
towards our Peace and Solace. As it is the
latter also, we cannot but receive Comfort from it,
because being a Certain and Unerring Guide in all
our Actions, it must needs administer great Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
and Joy to us through our whole Lives,
when we consider that we have a Stable Rule to
walk by, and that we cannot do amiss if we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that; but especially, when we reflect on our
Manners, and see that they are adjusted to this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
and that<note n="1" place="bottom">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>we have in Simplicity and godly Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
had our Conversation in the World.</hi> This will be
our <hi>Rejoicing</hi> and <hi>Exultation.</hi> Again, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
yields an inconceivable Joy, by prescribing
the Best Means for attaining Peace and Unity,
which are Comfortable Blessings of this Life; by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46315:475"/>
allowing us all Innocent and Harmless Delights,
such as will neither destroy the Peace of our Souls,
nor impair the Health of our Bodies; by through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convincing us that Christianity in it self is most
Satisfactory to our Minds, and is made to convey
Joy and Peace into our Hearts; by teaching us
Contentedness in all Conditions; by assuring us
that Christianity provides for our greatest and
most Important Wants, and supplies our most
Urgent Necessities, and therefore we ought to
acquiesce in it, and solace our selves with it.
Thus it administers the most Chearing Cordials:
and so it doth by directing us to the Worthiest
Ends, by setting before us the Strongest Motives,
the most Powerful Perswasives to our Duty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we are enabled not only to undertake it, but
to discharge it with Chearfulness and Delight; by
propounding and presenting to us the Best Rewards,
<hi>viz.</hi> Forgiveness of our Sins, Assurance of God's
Love, and Eternal Life and Blessedness: For as
a Great Man saith,<note n="1" place="bottom">Iudg <hi>Hale,</hi> in his Discourse of the Knowledg of God and of our Selves.</note> 
                        <hi>No Book in the World but this
shews a Man the Adequate End of his Being, his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Good, his Happiness, nor directs the Means of
acquiring it.</hi> The Bible is the Great <hi>Instrument</hi>
(as it was emphatically call'd by the Fathers)
of our Salvation and Happiness. By these <hi>Writings</hi>
we hold our Everlasting Inheritance: And these
are the Great <hi>Deeds and Evidences</hi> whereby we
prove our Title to it. In a word, as these sustain
and support us in all Conditions of our Life, and
give us a happy Prospect of a better State, so
they render Death welcom and joyful to us, they
enable us by virtue of those Sacred Truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46315:475"/>
in them, to expire our last Breath with Peace
and Tranquillity. On all which Accounts we must
acknowledg them to be the greatest Support and
Relief of our Souls, yea the Only Source of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and Content. Thus if you consider the Holy
Scriptures as they dictate the Best Principles, as
they beget in us the greatest Holiness and Purity,
and as they are the Solace of our Lives, we must
be forced to acknowledg their Incomparable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
                     <p>These three Particulars, wherein I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to display the Perfection of Scripture, are
to be found together in <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 7, 8. where These
Properties are ascribed to the Law of God, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that it <hi>enlightens the Eyes,</hi> and so is a Director

You find all these in conjunction in that other
remarkable Place, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. All Scripture</hi>
(whereby we may understand not only the Old
Testament, but part of the New, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>'s
<hi>Gospel,</hi> which was extant when <hi>Timothy,</hi> to
whom the Apostle here speaks, was <hi>a child, V. 15.)
is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable for
Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction
in Righteousness.</hi> It is not to be doubted that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
refers to the Understanding and Belief, and
<hi>Reproof</hi> and <hi>Instruction in Righteousness</hi> to the Will
and Manners: and then <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Rectifying, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing,
setting all streight again,</hi>(as the World im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports)
includes in it that Comforting and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which I spoke of. These are the Main Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the Holy Scripture. First, it is a Body
and System of the Best and most Consistent Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
it regulates the Apprehensions, and presents
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46315:476"/>
us with True Conceptions of things. Here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
delivered that thwarts our rectified Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
or is a Contradiction to the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
Faculties of our Minds. Moreover, it most
successfully conducts us into the Ways of Piety and
a Holy Life. The Design of it is to perfect hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, to exalt Men to the highest Pitch
their Condition is capable of, both by <hi>Moral</hi> and
<hi>Revealed Truth,</hi>(the latter of which none but the
Blessed Redeemer was able to communicate) to
bring them to the Noblest improvement and Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Vertue which they can possibly arrive to
on this side of Heaven: In brief, to make us act
not only as Rational but as Divine Creatures, yea
even to render us like God Himself. And lastly,
it not only inspires us with Excellent Principles,
and promotes the Practice of Holiness, but admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
the greatest Matter of Joy imaginable.
This raises our Spirits, and fills our Souls with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and Pleasure; this Strengthens and supports
us under our heaviest Crosses, and makes our Life
Happy, whatever befals us. All which are unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
Arguments of the <hi>Perfection of Scripture,</hi>
whence we are enabled to Believe aright, to Live
well, and to Rejoice. Thus these Holy Writings
were endited, that<note n="1" place="bottom">2. Tim. 3. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>we might be Perfect, throughly
furnished unto all good Works.</hi> And thus Scripture
must needs be <hi>Perfect,</hi> because its Design is to make
us so. But I am sensible that several Devout and
Practical Writers have enlarged on this Subject,
and therefore I will say no more of it, because my
present Discourse is designed to be chiefly <hi>Critical.</hi>
Let it suffice that I have briefly asserted the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
of the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> as to the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46315:476"/>
Particulars, and that I have shew'd that
this Perfection is not communicable to any Other
Writings under Heaven. Such is the <hi>Peculiar Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
of the Bible.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore it behoveth us to take notice and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of those Men who oppose, or rather deny this
<hi>Excellency</hi> and <hi>Perfection.</hi> First, the <hi>Circumcised Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
shew themselves great Oppugners of it, whilst
they excessively magnify their <hi>Traditions,</hi> and even
prefer them before the Sacred Text. We must
know then that the Jews talk much of their<note n="2" place="bottom">a <hi>kibbel</hi> accepit, quia à Majoribus accepta est.</note> 
                        <hi>Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
or (as that Word signifies) the <hi>Received Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
among them, which was propagated by Oral
Tradition and Continual Succession. This their
<hi>Cabala</hi> is twofold; First, that which deals in Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Criticisms and Curiosities about Words and
Letters, to which belongs the <hi>Masoreth,</hi> which
(as I have shew'd in another Discourse) is service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for the Preservation of the Bible. Secondly,
that which by them is call'd the <hi>Oral Law,</hi> or the
Law delivered from one to another, as an Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on the Written Law. It may not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
to give the Reader a short Account of this
<hi>Oral Law</hi> which they so much boast of. This was
either <hi>before Moses,</hi> and was the Doctrine of the
<hi>Patriarchs,</hi> propagated by Word of Mouth before
the Law was committed to Writing; it consisted
of the Seven Precepts of the Sons of <hi>Noah;</hi> of the
Apothegms, Sentences and Paradoxes of the Wise
Men in the first Ages; or it was <hi>in</hi> and <hi>after Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s
<hi>time,</hi> who is reckon'd the Great Author of
the <hi>Cabala,</hi> because he deliver'd it <hi>viva voce</hi> to the
Jews, say the Rabbins, at the same time that he
gave them the <hi>Decalogue</hi> and the Other Written
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46315:477"/>
Laws. This <hi>Torah gnal peh,</hi>(as they stile it) this
Oral Law is the Exposition of those Written Laws,
and is meant, they say, in <hi>Deut. 4. 14. The Lord
commanded me at that time to teach you Statutes and
Iudgments.</hi> And for this they alledg <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 21.
which they tell us refers to some Special Command
of God about <hi>Killing;</hi> and seeing we read no such
Special Command about it in the <hi>Written Law,</hi> it is
reasonable to conclude that it is to be understood
of the <hi>Oral one:</hi> that must be the Sense of those
Words there, <hi>As I have commanded thee.</hi> That
<hi>Moses</hi> received this Law on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
                        <note n="1" place="bottom">In Deuteron. cap. 34.</note> 
                        <hi>Rabbi Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chai</hi>
proves by the same Token that he knew by this
Law how long time he was upon that Mount; for
when God taught him the Written Law, then he
knew it was Day, (because he could not write in
the Dark) but when God gave him the Oral Law,
he knew then that it was Night. A most profound
Answer to the Difficulty, how <hi>Moses</hi> could tell
that he was 40 Days and Nights on the Mount.
Well, God (they say) delivered this Law to
<hi>Moses, Moses</hi> delivered it to <hi>Ioshua, Ioshua</hi> to the
<hi>Seventy Elders,</hi> they to <hi>Ezra,</hi> who (some say)
committed it to writing, for he was the Chiefest
Cabalist next to <hi>Moses;</hi> but the Books which he
composed of this Matter were lost, and so it went
on after the old way again, <hi>viz.</hi> by Tradition,
and came to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> of whom <hi>Zechary</hi> and
<hi>Malachi</hi> were the last, and from them the <hi>Great
Sanhedrim</hi> had it; and at last it was made into a
Book, that it might not be lost by reason of the
Dispersion of the Jews. He that compiled this
Volume or Book was <hi>Rabbi Iudah,</hi> who for the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Holiness of his Life was call'd <hi>Hakkadosh</hi> the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46315:477"/>
Saint: He flourish'd in the Days of the Emperor
<hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> about a hundred and twenty Years
after our Saviour's Passion. The Title which he
gave to it was <hi>Mishnah,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Repetition</hi> of the
Divine Law, or a Larger Explication of it given
immediately to <hi>Moses</hi> by God, and by Tradition
derived to the Jews. This <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, this Iterated
or Second Law is divided by him into six general
<hi>Sedarim,</hi> i. e. so many Heads or Subjects of which
it treats: and every <hi>Sedar</hi> is divided into Books,
every Book into Chapters or <hi>Pirka</hi>'s. About a
hundred Years after this famous Rabbi had reduced
the Traditions of the Jews into one Volume, the
Learned Doctors began to comment upon it; and
first the <hi>Ierusalem Talmud</hi>(call'd so because 'twas
made for the Jews that lived in <hi>Iudea,</hi> especially in
<hi>Ierusalem)</hi> was finish'd by <hi>R. Iochanan</hi> about <hi>A. D.</hi>
240. The Comment which he and the other Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies
made on the <hi>Mishnah</hi> is call'd the <hi>Gemara,</hi> the
Supplemental Exposition of that Volume of Jewish
Traditions. Next, the <hi>Babylonick Talmud</hi> was put
forth by the Learned Jews at <hi>Babylon,</hi> who gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Traditions into a more Compleat and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
Body (as they thought) for the Benefit of their
Country-men in those Parts of the World. It was
compiled by Rabbi <hi>Ase</hi> and his Companions about
<hi>A. D.</hi> 500. and consisteth (as the former Talmud)
of the <hi>Mishnaioth</hi> and the <hi>Gemara:</hi> the one is the
Text, the other is the Comment, or the Decisions
of the Doctors on the Book of the <hi>Mishnah.</hi> So then
the <hi>Oral Law,</hi> which the Jews so much boast of,
and set so high a Value upon, is contain'd in the
Two Talmuds, which are made up of the <hi>Mishnah</hi>
and the <hi>Gemara:</hi> The <hi>Mishnah</hi> is that which <hi>R.
Iudah</hi> compiled; the <hi>Gemara</hi>'s are the Work of <hi>R.
Iochanan</hi> and <hi>Ase,</hi> and other Rabbies; and both are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46315:478"/>
a Compleat Body of the Civil and Canon Law of
the Jews. Whoso nameth the <hi>Talmuds</hi> nameth all
<hi>Iudaism,</hi> saith <hi>Lightfoot:</hi> These (as he adds) are
the Jews Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> they are the last and
fullest Determinations which they have about all
their Religious Opinions, Rites and Usages. Thus
I have exhibited a brief Account of the whole
Talmudick System, wherein the <hi>Oral Law</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
explained, and descanted upon. And it
is not to be denied that there may be a very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Use made of this Collection of Jewish Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
it may be serviceable in sundry Instances to
expound the Mosaick Law, to acquaint us with the
Jewish Antiquities, to illustrate several Places in
the Old Testament, yea to interpret many Passages
in the New, which have reference to the received
Practices and Usages of the Jews.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Iews</hi>(who are the Persons whom I am
now blaming) make very ill Use of it, because
they immoderately extol these Traditions, calling
them <hi>Torah shebegnal Peh,</hi> their Infallible Oracle,
and esteeming the Authority of them equal with
that of the Bible. For as the Canonical Scriptures
were dictated by Divine Inspiration, so these Laws
they hold were from God Himself, and are of the
same Authority with those Scriptures. They
make no difference between the Inspired Writings
of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> and the Books of <hi>Mishnaioth</hi> or
the <hi>Talmuds,</hi> which are in truth an Amassment on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Traditions of the Jews, and of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Decisions of the Schools of <hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mai,</hi>
of the Different Determinations of <hi>R. Akiba</hi>
and <hi>R. Eliezer,</hi> of <hi>R. Simeon</hi> and <hi>R. Ioshua,</hi> &amp;c.
bandying against one another: or rather, if we
speak plainer, they are a Rhapsody of Idle Dreams,
Groundless Fables, Cursed Errors, Superstitious
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46315:478"/>
Rites and Practices, yea (if we should instance in
the <hi>Babylonick Talmud)</hi> of Horrid Blasphemies
against Christ, of Obloquies against the Mosaick
Law it self, and of Contradictions even to the Law
of Nature. These are part of the Books so highly
prized by the Jewish Masters, these go along with
their <hi>Oral Law,</hi> which was first given by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and consequently is of the same Original with
the Canon of Scripture. But they go yet higher;
for they do not only equalize these Traditions with
Scripture, but they prefer them before it. They
do not only say in a Proverbial Manner, that<note n="1" place="bottom">Impossible est stare super Fundamento Legis scriptae nisi bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>they
cannot stand upon the Foundation of the Written Law
without the Help of the Vnwritten one, i. e.</hi> the Oral
Law which they talk of; and that<note n="2" place="bottom">Verba Legis in loco proprio ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na funt, in alieno verò locupletissima.</note> 
                        <hi>the Words of

                        <hi>very Great and Weighty Matters depend upon these

are so bold and presumptuous as to proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and give a far Greater Deference to these
Traditions and Doctrines of their Wise Men (as
they call them) than to the Holy Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
For they tell us, that<note n="4" place="bottom">Sapientes suis ipsorum verbis robur secerunt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus quàm ipsis Legis verbis.</note> 
                        <hi>their Doctors have
done more good (viz.</hi> as to strengthning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming

Words of this Holy Book it self.</hi> And accordingly
their Advice is,<note n="5" place="bottom">Fili mi, attende magis ad verba Scribarum quàm ad verba Legis.</note> 
                        <hi>My Son, attend more to what the

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46315:479"/>
know this may admit of another Sense, <hi>viz.</hi> that
we ought to look more to the Sense of the Law

(i. e.</hi> it is not of any considerable Advantage) <hi>but
to turn over the</hi> Mishnah <hi>Night and Day is a Vertue

it is a Noted Saying of the Hebrew Rabbies, that
the Text of the Bible is like Water, the <hi>Mishnah</hi>
like Wine, and the Six Books of the Talmud are
like the Sweetest Honey'd Wine, Thus, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
the Traditions of their Fathers, they vilify
the Scriptures. They are not content with the

and Forgery, (as to the pretence of its being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

These Modern Talmudists will not own
the Sufficiency of the Sacred Writings, they have
<hi>their Cabala, the Doctrine Received</hi> from their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors:
they are for their <hi>Oral Law delivered</hi> from

                        <hi>there must be a Fence made about the Law,</hi> that
it must be hedged in with Traditions. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not a Perfect Rule of Faith and Manners,
say they: but the things which are necessary to
Salvation, are partly contained in the Scripture,
and partly in unwritten Traditions. A very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and wild Doctrine! because they have no
way to prove any thing to be necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but by proving it to be found in the Scripture.
Whatever was or is necessary for the Universal
Church is revealed in these Writings; and no New
Doctrine necessary to Salvation, is delivered since
to the Church or any particular Person. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Absurdity of this Tenent, they
hold it fast, and make it a Great Article of their
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46315:480"/>
Belief. For they are taught by an Oecumenical
Council (as they repute it) that Unwritten Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

equal with the Scriptures. But they rest not here;
they not only equal Humane and Ecclesiastical
Traditions with the Written Word of God, but
following the Steps of the <hi>Old Talmudists,</hi> they
proceed yet further, preferring Traditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Scripture. Thus a Renowned Divine in
their Church tells us plainly, that<note n="2" place="bottom">Est Tradi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

With him concur several others of their Writers,

                        <hi>I delivered to
you that which also I received:</hi> whence they have the
Name of <hi>Traditions,</hi> i. e. they are Evangelical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
delivered to us from those that were taught
them by Christ. And whether they were imparted
<hi>by Word or by Epistle,</hi> by Preaching or Writing, they
are the same, the same as to substance, the otherwise
there may be some difference. But that which we
condemn (and that most justly) the Papists for, is
this, that they magnify and rely upon <hi>Traditions</hi>
which have no affinity with the Doctrine of Christ
and the Apostles, yea, which contradict it in
many things; and yet they equalize these with the
Word of God, and sometimes prefer them and the
Authority of the Church, before that of the
Sacred Writings of the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Thus One saith,<note n="3" place="bottom">Ecclesia visa est ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando facere contra Scripturas, aliquando praeter Scripturas: ergo ipsa est Regula eorum quae traduntur in Scripturis, ergo credimus Ecclesiae contra formam Scripturarum. Caranza.</note> 
                        <q>The Church sometimes
doth things contrary to the Scriptures, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
besides them: therefore the Church is the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46315:481"/>
Rule and Standard of the things that are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
in the Scriptures, and therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Church, though she acts counter to
the formal Decisions of the Scriptures.</q> And an
<note n="1" place="bottom">Stapleton Relect, Controvers. 4. qu. 1.</note> other Famous Doctor gives it for good Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that the Decrees and Determinations of a
<hi>Council</hi> are binding, though they be not confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by any probable Testimony of Scripture, nay
though they be beyond and above the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scripture. Thus the Holy Writings of
the Bible are most impiously disparaged and vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
by the <hi>Pontificians.</hi> Whereas there is nothing
defective or redundant, nothing wanting or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
in these Writings: they assert in the open
face of the World that they are short and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and therefore have need of being supplied by
<hi>Traditions,</hi> which in some things are of greater
Value and Authority than they.</p>
                     <p>Again, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> oppugneth or
rather denieth the Perfection of the Scriptures,
might be evinced from their constant care and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to keep them in an <hi>Vnknown Tongue.</hi> It is
true they have translated them. But, 1. There was
a kind of necessity of doing it, the <hi>Protestants</hi> having
turned them into so many Tongues. By this means
they were compelled as it wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to let some of
their people see what the Bible was in their own
Language. But, 2. It is so corruptly translated
that it is made to patronize several of their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
Follies and Errors. And yet, 3. They
dare not commit these Translations to common
View. Although in all Countries where People
were converted to Christianity, in elder times the
Scripture was turned into their Language, and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46315:481"/>
every one was permitted, yea exhorted to read it,
(as is proved by many Writers,<note n="1" place="bottom">The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> examined, <hi>pag.</hi> 46, 47.</note> the Learned
Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> particularly) yet the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> denieth the common People the Use of it, as
a thing hurtful and pernicious. The Bible, as
some Bad Book, is <hi>tolerated</hi> to be read with great
Caution and Restriction, in <hi>some</hi> Countries only,
and by <hi>some</hi> Persons. It is, like the Sibyls Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
of old among the Romans, not to be look'd
into without the permission and Authority of the
Senate; none can read it without a Licence from
their Superiours: so dangerous a thing is the Bible.
From this Practice the People generally imbibe a
strong Prejudice against the Scriptures, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they cannot be good for them, because the
Pope and their Pastors tell them they are not.
Wherefore, as<note n="2" place="bottom">

great Reason or Motive (as he professeth) of his

                     <p>I Proceed now to the Second General Head of

the Bible as to things that are Temporal and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Not only all Religious, Divine and Saving
Knowledg is to be fetch'd hence, but that likewise
which is Natural and Humane, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>longs to the
World and Arts. Many believe the former, but
can't be induc'd to credit the latter; for they think
the Bible was writ only for the saving of Mens
Souls, but that all other Knowledg and Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46315:484"/>
are to be derived wholly from other Writers.
I have sometimes observ'd that Persons who have
had a good Desire to Learning, and were greedy
Devourers of all other Authors, yet have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to the Scriptures, and fondly imagine there is
no Improvement of Mens Notions, no enlarging
of their Understandings, no Grounds of Excellent
Literature from the Sacred Writ. They perswade
themselves that the Bible may serve well enough
for the Use of those that study Divinity, or make
Sermons, but that the Writings of Profane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
must be wholly consulted for other things.
But this is a gross Surmise, and possesses the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
Heads of those only that consider not the
Matchless Antiquity of the Bible, or that on a
worse Account refuse to acquaint themselves with
these Writings, and care not for that Book which
speaks so much of God and Religion, and checks
the Disorders of Mens Lives. All honest, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
and impartial Enquirers into Learning
know that the Scriptures are the Greatest Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Antiquity that is Extant in the whole
World, and particularly that the First and Earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Inventions of things are to be known only from
the Old Testament, especially the five first Books
of it. In vain do you look for these in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of other Men; for though some of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
very Antient Occurrences, yet they are not
so old as these: and as for those Writers who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to some Greater Antiquity, and have been so
impudent as to think that they could impose upon
the World, they have been exploded by all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Sobriety and serious Thoughts. In Pagan
Writers we have some wild Guesses at the Origine
of things, and the First Inventors of Arts; but he
that is desirous to have Certain and Infallible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46315:484"/>
concerning these, must consult the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>Moses</hi> and other Books of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
From these alone we learn what were the
Antientest Usages in the World, and what was
the first Rise and Original of them. Wherefore I
may safely pronounce that no Man can have the just
Repute of a <hi>Scholar</hi> unless he hath read and studied
the Bible: for in this one Book there is more Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Learning than in all the Books of the World
besides. And therefore here by the way I cannot
but look upon it as a very Scandalous Mistake, that
the knowledg and Study of the Holy Scriptures are
for <hi>Divines</hi> only, as if these were not to be skill'd
in any Humane Learning. They that talk after
this rate, understand not what the Study of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and True Scholarship are: for there is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Divine that is not well vers'd in Humane Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature,
and there is no Compleat Scholar that is
not skill'd in the Bible. Wherefore this is that
which I intend very particularly and largely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scriptures are the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entest
Storehouse of Good Letters and Learning,
and that here are All the Sorts of them, which I
conceive will be a full Eviction of what I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
<hi>viz.</hi> to demonstrate the Pre-eminence
of the Inspired Writings before all others whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                     <p>First; I begin with the <hi>Language</hi> in which the
greatest part of the Bible, that is, the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
was written, which is <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and was the
First and Original Tongue of the World. This
certainly inhanses the Worth of the <hi>Hebrew Text,</hi>
and renders the Bible preferable to all other Books.
It is true there are other Languages that pretend to
Priority; but when we come to examine their
claim, we discover it to be a mere Pretence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.

<hi>Abraham</hi> brought out of <hi>Chaldea.</hi> And <hi>Capellus</hi> in
his <hi>Sacred Chronology</hi> seems to espouse this Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But there is little Ground for it, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the <hi>Chaldee</hi> is borrowed from the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
and is a different Dialect of it. The <hi>Scythian</hi> is the
Primitive Tongue, saith <hi>Boxhorn. Goropius Becanus</hi>
fetches all Words from the <hi>Teutonick</hi> or <hi>High Dutch,</hi>
and would perswade us that this is the Mother-Tongue
of the World: but he hath given so slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Proof of it, that he hath gain'd but few Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes
to his Opinion. The Learned <hi>Bochart</hi> derives

more of the like Nature; which straining to
maintain his Opinion is unacceptable to wise Men.
A late Author hath publish'd an <hi>Historical Essay</hi> (as
he is pleased to call it) of the Probability of the
Language of <hi>China</hi> being the Primitive one, and
among other Offers towards it he hath this, that
the first Expression we make of Life at the instant
Minute of our Birth is by uttering the Chinois
Word <hi>Ya</hi> or <hi>Yah</hi> But by the same Reasoning I
can prove that the first Tongue was <hi>Hebrew,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Yah</hi> (for so most Hebricians pronounce it) is
one of the Hebrew Names of God: and how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is it for Infants to mention and acknowledg
their Maker as soon as they come into the World?
I allow the Author to be very Ingenious, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he is so wise himself as not to think he hath
brought any solid Proof for what he undertook.
Such another Attempt is his, who commends the
<hi>British</hi> or <hi>Welsh</hi> Tongue to us as the Antientest of
all. This Glory is due only to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> which
certainly was the Language that <hi>Adam spoke,</hi> and
was that peculiar Form of Speech which was given
to him by God, and which he taught his Children,
and which lasted incorrupt (there being no other
Tongue to be its Rival) till the Confusion of
Tongues at <hi>Babel,</hi> and the Dispersion which was
the Consequent of that. Of this those Words are
meant, Gen. 11. 1. <hi>The whole Earth was of one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,

without a Dictionary. But this Primitive Blessing
was not of very great Duration, for the Infallible
Records inform us that a notable Confusion of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
happen'd to the World when it was yet in
its Minority and Childhood, and had not long
learnt to speak, if we may reckon the Age of it
from the Deluge. By the Fault of Man, and the
Judgment of God, the One way of Speaking was
changed into diverse. But we are not to think
that this Change introduced into every Colony or
Plantation a Different Language, but only a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and peculiar Dialect: For the Difference of
the Idiom was sufficient to beget a not-understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one another, as we see at this day the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
Danes, Swedes, Norwegians, Dutch, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,
understand not one another when they speak,
though they have not properly a Different Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
but only Several Dialects, for they all speak
<hi>Teutonick.</hi> The <hi>Confusion of Tongues</hi> then was not
New Tongues, but a considerable Variation from
the Primitive one, <hi>viz. Hebrew.</hi> Hereupon the
<hi>Babel</hi>-Builders (who before spoke and understood
this Language, it being their native one, as it was
of all the rest of Manking) were so confounded,
that they were forced to lay aside their Tools, and
leave off working. And that this <hi>Confusion</hi> was
not an Introduction of really Distinct Tongues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (as
some have thought) is evident hence, that there is
a <hi>Great Affinity</hi> between Tongues, especially the
<hi>Eastern</hi> ones (for as for others, they have had their
Rise since, and we are not to imagine that at the
Babylonick Confusion they spoke Italian, Spanish
or French, or that afterwards there were any of
the <hi>Plantations</hi> that understood English, Dutch or
Irish). I speak then concerning the Eastern Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
and assert them to be Different Dialects or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:46315:486"/>
Modes of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue: which is sufficiently
proved from the <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Cognation</hi> between
them. I remit the Reader to <hi>Skickard, Hottinger</hi>
and others, for the particular Eviction of this.
He will from them be perswaded that Tongues
were not Multiplied at <hi>Babel,</hi> but Divided; and
that that One Language which had been in use
ever since the beginning of the World, received
there an Alteration and new Modification: the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of which was the Cause, that Persons could
not understand one another.</p>
                     <p>Now that the First Tongue which <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve</hi> spake, and was used before the Division of
Languages, and was the Original from whence all
the other Languages are but Variations, was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
is apparent from that foresaid Cognation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Hebrew and other Oriental Tongues.
We find that this One Language hath spread it
self more or less into all others. We may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
in them some Words either purely Hebrew, or
of near alliance with it. It is well known that the
<hi>Chaldeans</hi> and <hi>Syrians</hi> have abundance of Hebrew
words in their Tongue, only there is some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the inflection of them. The <hi>Arabick</hi>
likewise hath great affinity with the Hebrew, and
so have the <hi>Punick</hi> and <hi>Ethiopick,</hi> as the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Bochart</hi> hath demonstrated. And this you
may observe (which confirms the thing I am esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing)
that the nearer any People were to the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> and their Country, the greater Number of
Hebrew Words and Idioms they retained in their
Languages: and on the contrary, the more remote
any Nation was from them, the fewer Hebrew
Words have they, and the greater Strangers are
they to their manner and way of Speaking. But
there are some Reliques of that Primitive Tongue
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46315:487"/>
every where: all Languages have borrowed from
this, as<note n="1" place="bottom">Lingua Hebraica omnium linguarum matrix. Commentar<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the Mother-Tongue of all. Again, where should
we look for the <hi>Original Language,</hi> and where
should we hope to find it, yea, where is it possible
to find it but among the First People of the World,
and the immediately succeeding Generations of
Men before the Flood and Confusion of Tongues?
Accordingly we discover that <hi>Hebrew</hi> was that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
which was in use with them. The Book of
<hi>Genesis</hi> abundantly testifies this, where are the
Names <hi>Adam, Ishah</hi> (Woman) <hi>Chavah</hi> or <hi>Eve,
Cain, Abel, Seth, Noah,</hi> and a Multitude of other
Words of <hi>Hebrew Extraction,</hi> which are Arguments
that <hi>Hebrew</hi> was the Language of those first Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and therefore the Primitive One. The Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology
and Derivation of these Words do irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gably
prove this, for there is no other Tongue
that hath these Words from whence these Names
are taken but the <hi>Hebrew;</hi> therefore this was the
First Tongue. And this was it which <hi>Noah</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
into the Ark with him: and if he did so, no
Man questions that he brought it out with him,
and that it was universally used till the <hi>Babel</hi>-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy.
Otherwise it could not be said (as we
have heard) that the whole Earth before that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
<hi>was of one Lip</hi> (or Language) <hi>and one Speech.</hi>

that there was only One Language in use at first:

there was One Universal Language in the World
at that time, and no more; which from what
I have suggested appears to be Hebrew. And as
this was the Common Tongue of the World above
seventeen hundred Years, (<hi>viz.</hi> from the Creation

further, that the Curse of the Confusion of

Tongues fell only or chiefly on those People that
were at <hi>Rabel,</hi> and concern'd in that Wicked Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit,

the holy Posterity of <hi>Noah</hi> assisted not in the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And that Worthy Critick himself, who makes the

scan what he saith, we shall see that even accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him the <hi>Phaenician</hi> and <hi>Hebrew</hi> are the same,
which appears from this, that he holds the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites
and Phaenicians to be the same People.
<note n="1" place="bottom">Geogr. Sac. Canaan.</note> He proves that the Phaenicians or Punicks, or
Syrians, or Sidonians, (for they were Known by
all these Names) were formerly the Inhabitants
of <hi>Cana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when he subdued that Land, they carried Colonies
into most parts of the World, and their Language
is found in all Languages of other People, as he
endeavours to shew. This is the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue
he confesses, abating the <hi>Difference of Dialect;</hi>
and therefore Hebrew (he saith) is call'd <hi>the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>
of Canaan, Isa. 19. 18. If then the <hi>Punick</hi>
was in its first Purity <hi>Hebrew</hi> (as some others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<hi>Bochart</hi> grant) it follows that in proving the
former to be the Original Tongue, he doth in
effect prove that the latter is so, because they are
the same. And truly it is no hard task to evince
the Language of the Canaanites to have been He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
for all the Proper Names of Men and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
reckoned up in Scripture in those Nations are
purely Hebrew, as <hi>Salem, Ierusalem, Hebron,</hi> &amp;c.
To which a<note n="2" place="bottom">Weems.</note> Learned Scots-man gives his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage,
expresly vouching that the Canaanites spoke
Hebrew, and that the Hebrew Tongue is call'd
<hi>the Language of Canaan,</hi> because 'twas the native
Language of those that possess'd that Land: to
prove which he produces the Names of Persons and
Places among them, as <hi>Melchisedek, Abimelek,
Kirjath-sepher, Iericho,</hi> &amp;c. and thence infers that
<hi>Hebrew</hi> was the native Tongue of the Canaanites
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46315:489"/>
or Philistines. And if this be true, then the
Great <hi>Selden,</hi> and with him many others are mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken,
who affirm, that<note n="1" place="bottom">De Dis Syr. Prolegom. <hi>C.</hi> 2.</note> the Hebrew Tongue
remained pure in the Family and Posterity of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
only, and that <hi>Abraham</hi> brought that Tongue
first into <hi>Canaan.</hi> The contrary appears, <hi>viz.</hi> that
this Tongue was preserv'd even in <hi>Canaan.</hi> But
Monsieur <hi>Bochart</hi> goes too far when he adds, that
<hi>Hebrew</hi> was not retain'd in the Families of <hi>Heber</hi>
and <hi>Abraham,</hi> but that this latter learn'd this
Tongue of the Canaanites when he lived with them
in <hi>Canaan.</hi> I do not see this clear'd by him, and
therefore I am enclined to believe that the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Tongue was both in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and
among the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> Though <hi>Abraham</hi> was a
Chaldean, and Chaldee was the Language of the
Country, yet by the singular Providence of God,
the Hebrew might be kept up and spoken by him.
Nor did this hinder his converse with the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
because the Chaldee is a Dialect of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew.
If it be objected that <hi>Canaan,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Canaanites were from <hi>Cham,</hi> who was a
<hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>abel</hi>-Builder, and how then was the <hi>Primitive He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
among them? It may be hard to resolve this,
and perhaps it is the only considerable Objection
against <hi>Bochart</hi>'s Opinion. I am not now obliged
to shew why it was so, but I am only concern'd to
attend to the Matter of Fact, <hi>Viz.</hi> that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites
spoke Hebrew, and consequently kept
their Tongue notwithstanding the Confusion at
<hi>Babel.</hi> And (that I may not wholly dismiss it
without giving a Reason of it) this might very
well be, because the Canaanite speaking Hebrew
was as much a Barbarian, and as little understood
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46315:489"/>
by another Family or Plantation, as if God had
infused a new Language or Idiom. So that we
need not wonder that Hebrew was the Language
of the ungodly Canaanites. Though truly, if I
may speak freely, I do not see that this is firmly
built on that Text in <hi>Isaiah</hi> before cited; for 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that that is a Prophecy concerning the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of the Gentiles, and particularly the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
to the True Religion and Worship, <hi>viz.</hi> that
of the <hi>Iews</hi> which was then in Being; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
This (and not the Antient <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of Canaan)</hi> is here meant by <hi>the Language of
Canaan.</hi> Or supposing the very Speech of that
Country to be meant, yet we can't thence abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
infer that the Canaanites spoke Hebrew,
but only that Hebrew is <hi>call'd the Language of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:</hi>
which might be for this reason, because the
Israelites who spoke Hebrew had possess'd the Land
of <hi>Canaan</hi> about eight hundred Years when this
was said by <hi>Isaiah.</hi> But this doth not prove the
Language of the Jews and the Old Canaanites to
be the same. Yet, notwithstanding this, from
what hath been before alledg'd, we have good
reason to conclude (as several<note n="1" place="bottom">Scaliger, Capellus, Erpenius, Vossius, Grotius, Bochart.</note> Learned Writers
have done) that the Hebrew Tongue was the same
with the Language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> i. e. the Language
which the Canaanites spoke.</p>
                     <p>From all which, laid together and compared
with what hath been said, we are confirm'd in this
Assertion, that <hi>Hebrew</hi> was the only Language that
was in use before the Confusion of <hi>Babel,</hi> and so
was the First Tongue, and the Mother of all other
Eastern Tongues. This is so evident that it hath
been the universal belief of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46315:490"/>
positive here; and it hath been held and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Learnedest<note n="1" place="bottom">Mercer, Junius, Pererius, Bertram, Pagnin.</note> 
                        <hi>Christians</hi> who have treated
on this Subject. This is the Language which God
himself spoke, as is manifest from abundant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
some of which have been referr'd to; and
there are many others, as God's changing of the
Names of <hi>Abram, Sarai, Iacob,</hi> &amp;c. and several
Names and Memorials in the forty Years abode
of the Israelites in the Wilderness, testify this.
This is the Antient and Holy Tongue that was
used by our First Parents; and without doubt it
was immediately taught them by God: for he that
bestow'd upon them other excellent Benefits, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
them not Speech. Therefore this was a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Gift of the Creator: this was one of the first
Donatives conferr'd on <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> And it
was enjoyed by them, and by all the Antediluvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
yea all <hi>Noah</hi>'s Posterity, till the Confusion
at <hi>Babel.</hi> In this first and antientest Language
was the Pentateuch, and even all the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
written, and that in those very <hi>Hebrew Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
which we have at this day, for the <hi>Samaritan</hi>
ones (which by some are cried up for the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entest)
are but a corrupt Imitation of these. In
this Holy <hi>Language</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> (both of his own
Institution) God would have the Sacred Mysteries
of his Religion express'd and recorded. In this
Book alone are the first Names of Men and Beasts
in that Tongue, denoting their particular Natures
and Qualities: which I might have mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to shew the Antiquity of this Tongue. Nay,
we are to remember this, that this first way of
speaking among Mankind, is no where preserved
but in these Writings: for after the Babylonian
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46315:490"/>
Captivity (which was about three thousand and
four hundred years after the Creation) this Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Speech was no longer the Language of any
particular Nation; for the Captive Jews lost this
Tongue at <hi>Babylon,</hi> (a Place fatal to <hi>Hebrew,</hi> at first
in the Confusion of Tongues, and afterwards in
this Peoples forgetting their Language there) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that at their Return home they could not
understand the Book of their own Laws but by an
Interpreter, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 7, 8. for they had chang'd
their Hebrew into a Mixt Language (compounded
partly of Hebrew and partly of Chaldee) which
was afterwards call'd <hi>Syriack.</hi> But in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
the pure Hebrew is kept entire and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and is extant at this day in no Writings
but these. If any Grammarians and Criticks could
say the like concerning the Greek or Latin Tongue,
that there is One Book wherein either of these in
its first Purity is wholly contain'd, they would be
very lavish in their Encomiums of that Volume,
and the Prelation of it to all others should not want
setting forth. Behold here the Whole Hebrew
Tongue, and that in its native Lustre, comprised
in the Old Testament! In no one Book upon Earth
besides this is there lodged a Whole Language;
which should invite all Admirers and Lovers of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Literature to prize it, and the Books written
in it. Certainly this is a high Commendation of
these Sacred Writings, and gives them the Prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to all others whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>Secondly; They rightly claim this, because they
acquaint us with <hi>the true Origine of the World,</hi> which
we find recorded in no other Writings. For tho
the Beginning of all things, and some Circumstances
which appertain to it, are obscurely intimated in
some Pagan Historians and Poets, and thereby
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46315:491"/>
(as I have lately shew'd on another occasion)
Testimony is given to the <hi>Authority of the Sacred
Writings,</hi> yet none of them give us a plain and
particular Account of this Beginning and Original
of the Mundane Fabrick. Yea, the very Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
Men among the Gentiles in a most wild and
rambling manner talk of the Rise of all things, and
at the same time ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>le themselves. Thus the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans
tell us a sensless Story of the Eternal frisking
of Atoms; which yet, if they were Eternal, had
no Beginning or Ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e at all. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and his
Disciples, and <hi>Plato</hi> and some of the Peripateticks
held that Men were always, and that there was an
Eternal Succession of them, and consequently no
Original of them. Others who believ'd they had
a Beginning, had strange and monstrous Fancies
concerning it, as that Men were form'd out of
Fishes, which was <hi>Anaximander's</hi> Conceit: Others
imagin'd they shooted out of Trees; some out of
Eggs; others out of Wombs affix'd to the Earth,
as <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Lucretius:</hi> Others (as the fabulous
Poets) conceited they were produced out of
Stones: and<note n="1" place="bottom">De Legib. I. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Cicero</hi> relates concerning some of the
Philosophers, that they thought the Original of
Mankind was from Seed falling from the Stars,
and impregnating the Earth. This stumbling at the
Threshold, these extravagant and groundless No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

were too ominous a Presage that these Philosophers
would grosly mistake about other Matters, and
give us but a sorry Account of the other Works of
Nature. But <hi>Moses</hi> confutes all these fond Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
about the Nativity of the World, and of
Mankind; he quashes all those wild Conjectures, by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46315:491"/>
assuring us that Man had his Origine from the Earth,
by God's peculiar framing him out of it; and that
the World it self had its Being by Creation, <hi>i. e.</hi>
by being made out of Nothing by the Infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and Wisdom of God. Wherefore it was right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
said by an Understanding Person,<note n="2" place="bottom">Neiremberg, de orig. Script. I. 2. c. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded</hi>
(saith he) <hi>that in the first Chapter of</hi> Genesis
Moses <hi>taught more than all the pagan philosophers and
Interpreters of Nature.</hi> And that this first Chapter
of the Bible is an Historical or Physical Account of
the Creation of the World, and is no Allegory, is
not to be question'd by any Man of a sober Mind
and consistent Reasoning. For thus I argue, It is
highly fitting that the Doctrine of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>irst Rise of
the Universe, the Production of all things, should
not be le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t doubtful, but be convey'd unto us in
such a way as may best preserve the Memory of so
weighty and considerable a Matter. For this is of
such Concern that our Belief of Providence and
the true Nature of God is comprised in it. Now
a Thing of this Quality ought not to be so deliver'd
that it may be liable to Imposture, or suspected of
Falshood or Uncertainty. As for <hi>private</hi> and <hi>perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Revelations</hi> (which some may here suppose)
these can only satisfy the individual Persons to
whom they are communicated: and as for <hi>Oral
Tradition,</hi> it is not so certain but that it may leave
some Scruples in Mens Minds. Hence it is reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
that the History of the World should be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
into such Records which may assure us of
what is to be believed, and therefore it is sit that
they should be Plain and Simple, and properly to
be taken and understood, so that they may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
as an Indubitable Account of the World's
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46315:492"/>
Production; therefore such is this Relation which
<hi>Moses</hi> hath lest us, which is a Perfect Diary of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
First Work of the Almighty.</p>
                     <p>But I will attempt yet further to prove that thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <hi>History</hi> deserves that Name, <hi>i. e.</hi> that it relates
what was really done. If this be acknowledged by
some Sacred and Inspired Author, I conceive that
will be a fair Conviction to those who believe that
Author to be inspired, and to deliver things that
are really true. That St. <hi>Peter</hi> then in the third
Chapter of his second Epistle (where he briefly
describes the Make and Frame of this World, as it
was formed at the first Creation) refers to this
<hi>Mosaick History,</hi> and also fully confirms it, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the Perusal of that his Description, where
you will find those very Terms which <hi>Moses</hi> in the
first of <hi>Genesis</hi> makes use of. <hi>This they are willingly
ignorant of,</hi> saith the Apostle, that <hi>the Heavens
were of old, i. e.</hi> from the Beginning, which in the
Verse before is called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the Beginning of
the Creation,</hi> which agrees exactly with the first
Words of <hi>Genesis.</hi> And these Heavens were <hi>by the
Word of God,</hi> which is a reference to <hi>God said,</hi>
which <hi>Moses</hi> expresly mentions, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 6, 14.
Next to the <hi>Heavens</hi> he makes mention of the
<hi>Earth,</hi> (as <hi>Moses</hi> doth) telling us, that it <hi>Stood</hi> or
<hi>consisted out of the Water and in the Water,</hi> which is
the same Account of it which we have in <hi>Genesis,
viz.</hi> that it was partly above Water and partly
under, <hi>i. e.</hi> it was <hi>above</hi> the Seas, Fountains, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
&amp;c. but <hi>under</hi> the <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>tyr</hi> Mass of Clouds. So that
any Man of unprejudiced Thoughts cannot but see
that those Words <hi>[the Earth standing out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in the Water]</hi> plainly relate to the Mosaical
History, where we are told that the Globe of Earth
included in it a heap of Waters call'd the <hi>Deep,</hi> or
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46315:492"/>
the <hi>Abys<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> which was afterwards gathered into one
Receptacle or Channel. This is call'd <hi>the Water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

the Firmament, i. e.</hi> under the Expansion of the
Air, as the Water above the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the Clouds
are call'd the <hi>Water above the Expansion,</hi> Gen. 1. 7.
Thus you see all this is alledged and acknowledged
by St. <hi>Peter</hi> as <hi>True History,</hi> and accordingly is
made use of by him: Wherefore we are ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
from his infallible Pen, that the Mosaick
Account of the Creation is no Fiction, no strain of
Poetick Fancy, but is perfectly Historical, and to
be taken in a real, proper and literal Sense, which
was the thing to be clear'd. Wherefore <hi>Origen,</hi>
and the rest of the Allegorists who despise the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this Chapter, and rely chiefly on some My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick
and Symbolical Meanings, are confuted. And
so likewise are they that adhere to the foolish
Dreams of Philosophers concerning the Eternity of
the World, or its being made by Chance, or the
Existence of More Worlds. All these are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with <hi>Moses</hi>'s Account of the Creation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that they affront other Principles establish'd
by the Holy Scriptures, and bid desiance to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and the greatest Evidence of things. So that
it is to be wondred that any Person who pretends
to own the Divine Authority of the Bible, should
publickly disown <hi>Moses</hi>'s Relation of the First Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of the World, and look upon this <hi>first</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Genesis</hi> (as well as he doth on the <hi>third</hi>) as
not True, <hi>i. e.</hi> not giving an Account of Matter
of Fact. But there was a kind of Necessity upon
him to form such Thoughts as these concerning
this Entrance of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Book, because he had in his
<hi>Theory of the Earth</hi> run counter to that Relation of
it which <hi>Moses</hi> gives. This is the bold Man that
asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ts the <hi>Primitive Earth</hi> to have been without
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46315:493"/>
                        <hi>Sea,</hi> and without <hi>Mountains,</hi> and the Airy Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to be without <hi>Clouds,</hi> which are a plain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
of <hi>Moses,</hi> who saith, <hi>the Waters were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
together, and were called Seas, ver.</hi> 10. and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us that there were <hi>other Waters above the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament</hi>
or Air, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. and in another Place lets
us know that <hi>all the high Hills and Mountains were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd</hi>
by the Waters of the Deluge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 19, 20.
Thus it must needs be ill philosophizing in defiance
of <hi>Moses,</hi> the first of the Philosophick Order. This
is Confutation enough of his Hypothesis; and
herein I am satisfied that the <hi>Excepter</hi> against his
Book is in the right. Now to support his own
Opinion, and to run down <hi>Moses,</hi> he tells us, that
instead of a <hi>History</hi> we are here presented with a
<hi>Parable,</hi> with an Ethical Discourse in an obscure
way. This Philosophick Romancer turns the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures into <hi>Aesop</hi>'s <hi>Fables,</hi> and seems with
his Friend <hi>Spinosa</hi> to hint that the Writings of the
<hi>Prophets</hi> are only high Flights of <hi>Imagination.</hi> God
forbid that I should fasten any such thing upon him,
(or any the like Imputation on any other Man of
Learning) or so much as suspect it unless there
were some ground for it. I appeal therefore to all
persons of correct Thoughts, whether his asserting
that <hi>Moses</hi> the Prime and Leading <hi>Prophet</hi> is so fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
that he presents us with mere <hi>Allegories</hi> and
<hi>Parables,</hi> even when he seems to speak of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World, and the Fall of our First Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
whether (I say) this doth not argue that
the rest of the <hi>Prophetick</hi> Writers (who could not
do amiss in imitating so Great a Guide) are led
wholly by Imagination, and dictate not things as
they really are, but as they fancied them to be.
Nay, he not only overthrows the Truth and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of <hi>Moses's</hi> Writings, but he blasts the Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46315:493"/>
of the Penman himself, telling us, that he was
a Crafty Politician and Dissembler, one that did all
to comply with the People, one that cheated the
ignorant Jews with a thing like an History, merely
to please them, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lst in the mean time it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a piece of Morality in an Allegorized
way, and is to be understood so by us. Certainly
<hi>Moses</hi> needed not to have been Inspired by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost (as I suppose most grant him to be) to
have merited this Character. But I have animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
on him with some Freedom in a former
Discourse, and therrfore I will not say any more
here. Nor should I have said any thing then, or
now, if I had not been verily perswaded that the
Credit of <hi>Moses,</hi> and of the Scriptures themselves,
and consequently of our whole Religion, lay at
stake: for if this 1st Chapter of <hi>Genesis,</hi> together
with the rest which follow, which have all the
Marks of <hi>History</hi> upon them, be not Literal and
Historical, we know not what Judgment to make
of any other Places of Scripture which recite Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact, we can't tell whether any Text bears
a Literal Sense or no, and so we throw up the
whole Bible into the Hands of Scepticks and
Atheists.</p>
                     <p>After all that I have said under this Head, I
would not be thought to mean any such thing as
this, that the Scripture was <hi>designed for Philosophy:</hi>
No, there are Nobler things that it aims at. Yet
this is most certain, that here is the Best Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
both Moral and Natural. It is the latter I
am now speaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> the Knowledg of the
Works of Nature, <hi>God's creating of the World,</hi>

<hi>Ionia</hi> and all the Greeks. And <hi>Greece</hi> is expresly
call'd <hi>Iavan,</hi> Dan. 10. 20. &amp; 11. 2. So that there
is no Reason to doubt that this Son of <hi>Iapheth</hi> was
the Father of the <hi>Grecians. Moses</hi> goes on, and
mentions the four Sons of <hi>Iavan: 1. Elisa,</hi> whose
Portion was <hi>Achaia,</hi> and part of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> as
some of great Learning have inferred from this,
that in this Country they meet with <hi>Ellas,</hi> and the
<hi>Elysian</hi> Fields, and the City <hi>Eleusis,</hi> and <hi>Elis</hi> a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> who took their Names from
<hi>Elisa.</hi> Some also make him the Parent of the <hi>Aeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
in <hi>Greece. 2. Tarshish,</hi> from whom the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
that he inhabited is call'd <hi>Tarsis,</hi> on the Coast
of which is the Great Sea or Mediterranean,
whence <hi>Tarshish</hi> is the Word to signify the <hi>Sea.</hi>
It is reasonable to think that the Place where this
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46315:496"/>
second Son of <hi>Iavan</hi> was seated is <hi>Cilicia,</hi> the chief
City whereof was <hi>Tarsus,</hi> call'd so by his Name
And it appears that the Cilicians of old were
known by the Appellation of the People of <hi>Tarsus,
3. Kittim</hi> or <hi>Chittim,</hi> whose Dwelling is thought
to have been <hi>Lycia</hi> and part of <hi>Pamphylia;</hi> for the
Country <hi>Cetis</hi> and the People <hi>Cetii,</hi> the first men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> the second by <hi>Homer,</hi> shew that
the Sons of <hi>Cittim</hi> or the <hi>Citteans</hi> inhabited there.
That <hi>Chittim</hi> is meant of some parts of <hi>Greece</hi> is
clear from <hi>Numb. 24. 24. Ships shall come from the
Coasts of</hi> Chittim: By which are understood the
Greeks and <hi>Seleucidae</hi> that cross'd the <hi>Hellespont,</hi>
and came against the Hebrews and Assyians. And
in 1 <hi>Mac.</hi> 8. 5. the King of <hi>Macedon</hi> is call'd <hi>the
King of</hi> Chittim. And because there were seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Colonies of them sent into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> this bears
the Name of <hi>the Land of</hi> Chittim, <hi>Isa.</hi> 23. 1. and
<hi>Chittim,</hi> ver. 12. for thence <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great

was peopled by the <hi>Chittians,</hi> and therefore is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
understood by that term. The <hi>Ierusalem-Targum</hi>
interprets the Word so in <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 4. And
when it is said, <hi>The Ships of</hi> Chittim <hi>Shall come
against thee, i. e.</hi> against <hi>Antiochus,</hi> Dan. 11. 30.
the Meaning is thought by some Learned Writers
to be, that the Romans by Sea should disturb him.
But I conceive that this may be true, and yet <hi>Chit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:46315:496"/>
may in this Place (as before) signify <hi>Cilicia,</hi>
for the Ships of the Romans commonly harboured
in the Ports of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> to command the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean.
The short is, from consulting and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
the several Texts where <hi>Chittim</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
I find Reason to determine, that some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
both of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> are comprehended in
it: and accordingly there is Reason to believe that
there were different Colonies of the Posterity of
<hi>Chittim.</hi> (the Grandchild of <hi>Iaphet</hi>) planted in
these Places. This puts an End to the Disputes
and Quarrels of the Learned on both sides; some
of whom contend that <hi>Greece,</hi> others that <hi>Rome</hi> is
meant by <hi>Chittim. 4. Dodanim,</hi> whose Seat was
<hi>Epirus</hi> and part of <hi>Peloponnesus.</hi> The Name is kept
up in the City call'd <hi>Dodona,</hi> (which is in <hi>Epirus</hi>)
near to which was <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Oracle, whence he was
stiled <hi>Dodonaeus.</hi> This <hi>Iupiter</hi> was this <hi>Dodanim,</hi>
the fourth Son of <hi>Iavan,</hi> who was the Grecian <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi>
for there were <hi>Iupiters</hi> many, and <hi>Saturns</hi>
many.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iaphet</hi>'s fifth Son was <hi>Tubal</hi> or <hi>Thubal,</hi> who took
up his Habitation at first, it is probable, about the
South-East of the Euxine Sea, where dwelt the
<hi>Albani, Chalybes, Iberi,</hi> who were antiently call'd
<hi>Thobeli,</hi> saith the Jewish Antiquary, from this
<hi>Thubal:</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> speaks of a City here named
<hi>Thubilaca.</hi> From those Parts some of the <hi>Iberi</hi>
were translated to <hi>Spain,</hi> which was thence called
<hi>Iberia,</hi> and so the Spaniards are reckoned as the
Posterity of <hi>Tubal. Meshech</hi> was <hi>Iapheth</hi>'s Sixth Son,
to whom fell <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> the Inhabitants whereof
were the <hi>Meschini</hi> and <hi>Moschi,</hi> saith the foresaid
Antiquary, who are also mentioned by <hi>Strabo, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
and <hi>Pliny.</hi> Some of his Posterity were placed
in <hi>Scythia</hi> and the Regions adjacent, whence we
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46315:497"/>
find that <hi>Meshech</hi> and <hi>Tubal</hi> (which are constantly
joined together in Scripture) are Words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
<hi>Scythia,</hi> Ezek. 32. 26. and <hi>Magog</hi> is joined
with them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. 2, 3. where <hi>Gog in the Land
of Magog</hi> is said to be <hi>chief Prince of</hi> Meshech <hi>and</hi>
Tubal. And it is moreover probable that the
<hi>Muscovites</hi> are of the Race of <hi>Meshech</hi> or <hi>Moshech,</hi>
(for the Word was pronounced differently, as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> and <hi>Moloch</hi>) it being generally granted by the
Learned that the Muscovites were originally from
<hi>Scythia.</hi> To confirm which Opinion I will offer
this Observation to the Reader, that the Seventy
Interpreters render <hi>Meshech</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. 2. <gap reason="foreign">

where <hi>Rhos</hi> gives the Denomination to the

The last Son of <hi>Iapheth is Tiras,</hi> who is univrsally
agreed to be the Progenitor of the Thracians,
<hi>Thrax</hi> having a near Cognation with <hi>Thiras.</hi> It is
yet further remarkable in this Account which is
given us of the First Plantations, that by these
foresaid Sons of <hi>Iapheth the Isles of the Genciles were
divided in their Lands,</hi> Gen. 10. 5. The Hebrews

from several Texts of Scripture where the word

taken in this large Sense sometimes. Accordingly
there being no part of the World call'd by the
Name of <hi>Christendom</hi> but what was divided from
the Jews by Sea, we may gather how large and
wide the Allotment of <hi>Iapheth</hi> and his Posterity
was. <hi>The Isbes of the Gentiles</hi> include not only all

Opinion, that <hi>Ophir,</hi> from whence <hi>Solomon</hi> fetch'd

(you will say) among Authors: the <hi>East</hi>

belongs to <hi>Africa,</hi> say <hi>Volaterranus</hi> and
<hi>Ortelius:</hi> but I rather think that <hi>Africa</hi> it self,
or the African Shore is meant by it. Which seems
to be confirmed from 2 <hi>Chron. 9. 21. &amp;</hi> 20. 36.
(compared with 1 <hi>Kings 9. 28. &amp; 10. 22. &amp; 22.

this Name belongs properly to the Cilician Port,
which is on the other Side of <hi>Africa,</hi> yet (as I
have shew'd in another Place) in a large Accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it comprehended all the Mediterranean Sea, and
that Part especially which wash'd the African
Shores: and hither it is probable <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Fleet
sailed, and the Merchants went up into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

                        <hi>Cham</hi> or <hi>Ham</hi> (the youngest Son of <hi>Iapheth</hi>)
and the Families that descended from him, were
first seated in this Country of <hi>Africk,</hi> though some
of them made Excursions also into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Arabia.</hi>
That he was seated in <hi>Egypt</hi> (the most considerable

cannot be denied by any Man that well observes
what the use of the Name <hi>Cushi</hi> or <hi>Cushim</hi> is in
the Sacred Writings. <hi>Havilah,</hi> one of <hi>Cush</hi>'s

Third <hi>Sheba,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ioctan,</hi> (whom also we
find in this <hi>10th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi>) it is to little
purpose here to dispute. <hi>Mesraim,</hi> the second
Son of <hi>Cham,</hi> was questionless the Founder of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> for that is the known Name that it hath in
the Hebrew of the Old Testament. From<note n="1" place="bottom">Antiqu. L. 1. C. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus</hi>

be look'd upon as an Extravagant Conjecture if I
guess that <hi>Phetz</hi> or <hi>Fez,</hi> a Kingdom of <hi>Mauritania,</hi>
is a Corruption of that Word. The fourth and

the Canaanites. His Sons were <hi>Sidon, Emori, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buss,
&amp;c.</hi> from whom were the Sidonians (includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of <hi>Palestine</hi> was (as I said before) part of
<hi>Shem</hi>'s Portion, but <hi>Canaan</hi> invaded it, and thence
it bore his Name. The Learned <hi>Bocbart</hi> thinks this

she whom St. <hi>Matthew</hi> calls a <hi>Woman of Canaan,</hi>
is said by St. <hi>Mark</hi> to be a <hi>Syro-Phoenician.</hi> It is
this Great Critick's perswasion that the Phoenicians
were originally Canaanites, and that they fled out
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when <hi>Ioshua</hi> came and took Possession
of their Country: then they went and seated
themselves on the Sea-Coast of <hi>Palestine,</hi> call'd by
them afterwards <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> as the Britains upon
the coming of the Saxons betook themselves to
that part of the Country which is now known by
the Name of <hi>Wales.</hi> This Excellent Person hath
with great and manifold Arguments attempted
the Establishment of this Assertion, and hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
<note n="1" place="bottom">Bochart in Phaleg.</note> shew'd that there are several plain Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of those <hi>first Planters</hi> in the Names in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy.
I might confirm this from a very remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
Passage in <hi>St. Augustine,</hi> who assures us<note n="2" place="bottom">Exposit, in Epist. ad Rom.</note> that
in his time the Peasants of <hi>Hippo,</hi> who were known
to be of the Race of the Phaenicians, when they
were ask'd who they were? used to answer they
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46315:500"/>
were <hi>Canaans:</hi> which plainly shews that <hi>Canaan</hi>
and <hi>Phoenicia</hi> were the same.</p>
                     <p>But this I would add here, that <hi>Phoenicia</hi> is a

I conceive the former takes in all those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

that <hi>Phoenicia</hi> had its Denomination from

                     <p>This is the Division of the World among the
Sons of <hi>Noah;</hi> thus<note n="1" place="bottom">Deut. 32. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>the most High divided to the
Nations their Inheritance, he separated the Sons of</hi>
Adam, <hi>he set Bounds to the People. Iapheth</hi>'s Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
was the Northern and Western Parts of
the Earth: <hi>Shem</hi> had the East: and <hi>Cham</hi> had his
lot between both. <hi>Moses</hi> reckons up in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fourteen Persons of the Posterity of <hi>Iapheth,</hi>
six and twenty of the Race of <hi>Shem,</hi> and nine and
twenty of that of <hi>Cham:</hi> who all with <hi>Iapheth,
Shem</hi> and <hi>Cham</hi> themselves amount to seventy two:
and just so many <hi>Languages</hi> (or rather <hi>Dialects</hi>)
some think there were, and the very same number
of <hi>Nations</hi> occasion'd by the rise of those Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
It is a most difficult Task to assign exactly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46315:500"/>
the several Particular Regions and People derived
from the Posterity of <hi>Noah,</hi> and their proper
Seats and Habitations. <hi>Arias Montanus, Bochart,
Raleigh, Heylin</hi> (besides others before them, who
have writ of this Subject) seem to differ not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and yet they all agree in the main. Nay,
where you see different Places and Regions assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by them, they may all be true: for one may set
down the first Seats of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Offspring; another
may mention the Colonies they sent forth, which
lie it may be a great way off of the first Seats;
and another may take notice of their Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Invasions. But whatever it is that is
said by any Authentick Writer concerning this
peopling of the several Parts of the Earth, it is
all founded on the <hi>Mosaick History.</hi> Here we are
told that the Parts of the World were divided by
the Sons of <hi>Noah, every one after his Tongue, after
their Families in their Nations,</hi> Gen. 10. 5. The
Confusion of Tongues was that which divided Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies:
and yet by the Affinity of the Tongues
there was an Union made, for those that agreed
in the same Idiom joined together, and went and
seated themselves together. And who these First
Planters were, the Sacred History particularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us. As we have no Book but this that
lets us know who were the first People in the
World, who were before the Flood; so none but
this tells us who the most Considerable Persons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it, and by whom the Several Nations of the
World were first erected, and Colonies were sent
forth into all the Parts of the Earth.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly; The true Knowledg of the <hi>Original
of Civil Government,</hi> and the <hi>Increases</hi> of it,
and the <hi>Different Changes</hi> it underwent, is to be
drawn from these Sacred Fountains. We may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46315:501"/>
form our selves here (and no where else) that the
Primitive Government was <hi>Paternal,</hi> i. e. it was
seated in Fathers of Families; as first in <hi>Adam</hi>
and other Heads of Families, who then lived a
very long Time. It is true, we are told by <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi>
that<note n="1" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. Politic. <hi>L. 2, C.</hi> 8.</note> the Power of Parents over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
was a Regal and Sovereign Dominion: the
one (<hi>i. e.</hi> Parents) were the first Kings, the other
(<hi>i. e.</hi> Children) were the first Subjects. But this the
Philosopher could learn from no other Book but
the Bible, or from those Traditions which were
founded on these Antient Records, because no
other Writings give an Account of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which was first of all settled among the Sons
of Men. Here, and only here, we are told that
<hi>Adam</hi> and the other first Partriarchs were Supreme
Governours in their respective Tribes and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
that the Father of every Family was at the first
the King of it, and reigned over his Children
and Houshold as Soveraign; and that upon the
Decease of the Father, the <hi>Eldest Son</hi> by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Right and Title was Successor, and inherited
the Paternal Power and Dominion. Thus with
the <hi>Paternal Rule</hi> went <hi>Primogeniture;</hi> i. e. the
First-born Sons of Fathers of Families were Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
and there were many of these every where.
And thus the Authority quietly and peaceably ran
in this Channel, and 'tis not likely was interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
till some years before the Flood, when there was
a general Corruption of Mankind, and some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
extraordinary Dominion and Sway, and
perverted the Primitive way of Government.
After the Flood we find that the Authority was
continued in the Heads and First-born of Families:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46315:501"/>
and now by a more especial Commission the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate's
Authority is confirm'd, <hi>Gen. 9. 5. who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be
shed.</hi> The Ruler is authorized to punish Murder
with Death, to require Blood for Blood. This is
the first Formal Appointment of the Power of the
Sword that we read of, this is the first Erection
of a Tribunal of Life and Death. From some<note n="1" place="bottom">Gen. 8. 20. &amp; 12. 2. &amp; 35. 3.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in the Records of this Time we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the Sacerdotal Dignity was joined to the
Secular Power: they that were Magistrates were
Priests. And so far as we are able to discover,
these Offices were exerted by those who had the
Paternal Right, or that of Priority of Birth. Thus
it was in the first <hi>Patriarchal Oeconomy;</hi> this was
the Government which lasted till after the Deluge
in the Race of <hi>Shem.</hi> For as yet there was no one
Person who usurped Authority over all the rest,
(though those of <hi>Cham</hi>'s Offspring had a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
in the mean time, <hi>Nimrod</hi> being their King, of
whom I shall speak afterwards) but the <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
kept up the first and original Laws of Paternity
and Primogeniture all the time they lived at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
there was no failure of this Government till
they were brought under the Egyptian Yoke.
And then afterwards, when the Jewish People
were in the Desarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> the Primogeniture
more signally ceas'd in <hi>Moses,</hi> who was appointed
by God himself to be Ruler over them. And
so we are come to give an Account of the Civil
Government of the <hi>Iews,</hi> which we can learn from
no other Writings under Heaven but These. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
I say, was their Ruler, and was the First of that
kind that they had. He was not only their Captain
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46315:502"/>
and Leader, but their Civil Magistrate; yea he may
be said to be their <hi>King,</hi> for even that Title is
given to him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 5. Moses <hi>was King in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shurun,
i. e.</hi> in <hi>Israel.</hi> He was an Absolute King,
say<note n="1" place="bottom">Devit. Mosis,</note> 
                        <hi>Philo,</hi> and the Jewish Doctors, and<note n="2" place="bottom">De Synedr. l. 2.</note> Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and some others. <hi>Ioshua</hi> was their next
Ruler, Captain and King; who was succeeded by
the <hi>Iudges,</hi> who were, like the Roman Dictators,
set up upon emergent Occasions to desend, protect
and deliver the People. But all this time the Jews
were under a <hi>Theocracy, i. e.</hi> they were governed
in a more signal manner by <hi>God.</hi> They received
their Laws from Him, and he appointed the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
for the Breach of those Laws: They
went to War by His Advice and Direction, and
they did nothing in Civil or Ecclesiastical Affairs
without consulting him. Thus <hi>God</hi> was their <hi>King;</hi>
it was a Divine Government; and the <hi>Iudges</hi> were
but God's Vicegerents, and held a Power under
Him. That God himself exercised this Regal
Power over the Jews, was expresly acknowledged
by <hi>Gideon,</hi> Judg. 8. 23. <hi>I will not rule over you,</hi>
(saith he to that People) <hi>neither shall my Son rule
over you, the Lord shall rule over you. So Samuel</hi>
told the People, that <hi>the Lord their God was their
King,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 12. And this is implied in what
God said to <hi>Samuel, They have not rejected thee, but
they have rejected me, that I should not Reign over
them,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 7. This <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> among
the <hi>Iews</hi> began when he renewed the <hi>Covenant</hi>
with them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5, 6. Then they took God
for their King and Governour; and accordingly
the Jewish Government is stiled a <hi>Theocracy,</hi> not only
by<note n="3" place="bottom">Contr, Appion. l. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus,</hi> but many of the Christian Writers.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46315:502"/>
But this wanton People desired another King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
God; they would by no means be Singular,
they would be Ruled as other Nations were; a
King they must have, as <hi>Egypt, Babylon, Syria,
Persia,</hi> and the rest of the Pagan World had.
And a King they had according to their earnest
Desire; for they chose <hi>Saul</hi> to be their King in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siance
of God's Soveraignty over them: and now
the <hi>Theocratical Dispensation</hi> ceased. Their Kingly
Government lasted till the Captivity, when <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
was their last King. After their Return from
<hi>Assyria</hi> they were governed by the <hi>Chief Heads of
their Tribes:</hi> Thus the Sacred Writings acquaint us
that <hi>Zerobabel,</hi> a Prince of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
was their Supreme Ruler. But the Canonical
Scripture goes not on to tell us the great Variety
of Governours over the Jews after the Captivity:
Only in the New Testament we read of <hi>Herod,</hi>
who was the first Stranger that was King of the
Jews, but the last of all their Kings; for their
that famous Prophecy of the <hi>Scepter departing from
Iudah</hi> was accomplished, and <hi>Shiloh,</hi> the Blessed
Saviour, the Prince of Peace, came into the World.</p>
                     <p>Having given you a short Survey of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
among the <hi>Iews,</hi> I will in the next Place speak
of the Particular Exertments of it in their <hi>Courts
of Iudicature.</hi> There was <hi>the Iudicatory of three
Men;</hi> two of which were chosen by the Parties
that were at Controversy, and those two chose a

tried by these <hi>Triumviri.</hi> I must add, that though
this was usually call'd the <hi>Iudicature of Three,</hi> yet
this Number was sometimes increased to five or
seven. And this must be noted, that these three,
five, or seven <hi>Iudges,</hi> or rather <hi>Iustices of the Peace,</hi>
were settled in every City and considerable Town,
and they tried the Causes, and decided the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies

as concern'd the <hi>Life</hi> of Men, were brought and
tried here. This Court was also called the<note n="3" place="bottom">Sanedrim Katon.</note> 
                        <hi>Little
Sanedrim,</hi> or Lesser Consistory: and whereas the
former Judicature of <hi>Three</hi> was in every City,
this Court was in every Tribe in <hi>Israel.</hi> All the
Hebrew Writers of any Note, who designedly
treat of the <hi>Iewish Government,</hi> speak of these two
Courts, and therefore it is not to be question'd
that they were in use among that People. But it is
also unquestionable that they were not made use of
at first, <hi>i. e.</hi> either in <hi>Moses</hi>'s time, or three or
four Ages afterwards; otherwise we should have
had them particularly mentioned in the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which for my part I could never observe,
though some pretend to do so. It being therefore
our present Business to speak only of those things
relating to the <hi>Iewish Polity</hi> which are expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46315:503"/>
in Scripture, I will proceed to recount those
particular Models of Judicatures which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
taken notice of in these Sacred Writings,
and they are these. First, there was in every
Town a sufficient Number of <hi>Overseers</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who upon occasion met together to do them
Right: for the Tribes were divided into Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
Hundreds, Fifties, Tens, <hi>i. e.</hi> into so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Families; and over each Division there presided
<hi>Rulers of Thousands, Rulers of Hundreds, Rulers of
Fifties, and Rulers of Tens, to judg the People at all
Seasons,</hi> Exod. 18. 21, 25. And the same are called
<hi>Captains over Thousands, Hundreds, Fifties, Tens,
Numb. 31. 14. Deut. 1. 15. 1 Sam.</hi> 8. 5. and their
Business was to decide lesser Causes in these their
respective Thousands, Hundreds, &amp;c. Besides these
Ministers of Justice in every particular Town, there
were others of a larger Jurisdiction, who are call'd
<hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Heads of the Tribes,</hi> Numb. 13. 2. &amp; 34.
18. <hi>Chief of the Tribes,</hi> Deut. 1. 15. <hi>Officers among
the Tribes</hi> (in the same Place), and <hi>Iudges and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
throughout the Tribes,</hi> Deut. 16. 18. There were
Twelve of these, every Tribe having its distinct
Head and President over it; and these determin'd
in Causes of a greater and higher Nature than the
others. Moreover, there was a <hi>Senate of Seventy,</hi>
chosen out of the two former Ranks of Persons;
and they were designed at first to be Coadjutors to
<hi>Moses</hi> Numb. 11. 16. You will find that these are
mention'd together with the other two in <hi>Ios. 23. 2.
&amp;</hi> 24. 1. for by <hi>the Elders</hi> in both these Places are
meant, I conceive, the <hi>Seventy Seniors,</hi> and by <hi>the
Heads of Israel</hi> we are to understand <hi>the Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
and <hi>Governours of the Tribes;</hi> and by <hi>Officers
and Iudges</hi> the Ordinary and Inferiour Justices, <hi>viz.
Captains of Thousands, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:46315:504"/>
It was the first of these, namely, the Judicature
of <hi>Seventy Men,</hi> which was most considerable, and
therefore I will add a few Words concerning it:
Because <hi>Moses</hi> was President over it, the Jews
called it <hi>the Iudicature of Seventy one;</hi> and others,
adding <hi>Aaron</hi> to that Number, say, it consisted of
<hi>Seventy two.</hi> This famous Council, which was at
first appointed by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Wilderness, was
afterwards a Settled Council for governing the
People in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and was called the
<hi>Sanedrim,</hi> (which is a<note n="4" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> Greek Word originally,
but crept into the Hebrew, as other Greek Words
have done) but to distinguish it from the Lesser
one, it is called the<note n="5" place="bottom">Sanedrim Gedolah.</note> 
                        <hi>Great Sanedrim.</hi> The other
Courts sat in every City and Tribe, but This was
at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> only, and could sit no where else.
This Great Consistory judged of All Matters,
whereas the Others took Cognizance only of Lesser
ones. This was not only a <hi>Court of Common Pleas</hi>
or <hi>Nisi Prius,</hi> where only Civil Causes were tried,
but sometimes it determin'd both them and Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Actions. It was also a <hi>Chancery,</hi> or Court of
Equity. But the more special and peculiar Work
of this Court was to try the most <hi>Weighty Causes:</hi>
these most commonly were brought before these
Seventy Seniors: Matters of the Highest Nature,
the most Important Affairs of the Kingdom, and
such as belong'd to the Safety of the Publick, were
tried here. This Great Senate was chosen out of
all the Tribes, and consisted of Lay-men, Priests
and Levites. The King, or Chief Civil Magistrate,
was the Head of it, as <hi>Moses</hi> was at first. This
Assembly of the Seventy Senators was look'd upon
as the Chiefest and Highest Court of the Jews. The
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46315:504"/>
Supreme Power was thought to be seated here: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
all other Courts appeal'd to This, but
from This was no Appeal. But some are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Opinion, and add a Fourth Court of Justice,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Publick Council and Congregation of all the
People.</hi> This some make to be the Highest Court,
as in the Case of the Levitc's Wife that was cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
twelve Pieces. The Captains of Thousands,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Seventy Seniors, and All the Chief of the
People met together, made this Great Assembly,
this <hi>Mikel Gemot,</hi> this <hi>Parliament.</hi> This is that

                        <hi>the Great Congregation</hi> or
<hi>Assembly.</hi> These were the several Courts of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
amongst the Jews. Whilst <hi>Moses</hi> lived, he
judged and decided Controversies alone when he
thought fit; or when any of These Councils met,
he was the Prince and Head of them. So that the
Jewish Government (so far as it respected These
Courts) was partly Regal and Monarchical, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Moses;</hi> and it was partly Aristocratical, as
under the Captains of Thousands; and partly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratical
or Popular, under the <hi>Kahal</hi> of the
People. We are beholden to the Sacred Records
of the <hi>Old Testament</hi> for these excellent Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
relating to <hi>Government,</hi> which the most Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
Nations in the World have taken for their
Authentick Precedents.</p>
                     <p>Having spoken of their Methods of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Courts of Judicature, which are so just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admired and imitated by all Wise Governours,
I will next of all shew from these Antient Writings
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:46315:505"/>
how the <hi>Iewish</hi> Governours chastised and corrected
those that offended against their Laws. Their
Lesser Punishments were such as these: 1. <hi>Retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
Exod. 21. 24. <hi>Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth,
Hand for Hand, Foot for Foot.</hi> The plain Meaning
of which was, that whoever bereft another Person
of his Eye, Tooth, Hand or Foot, should be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
with the Loss of an Eye, a Tooth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
sometimes this literal and rigorous Sense of the
Law was put in practice. But generally it was not
understood in the strict Sense, but he that put out
another Man's Eye was to give him <hi>Satisfaction,
i. e.</hi> as much as an Eye was thought to be worth.
So the Targum of <hi>Ionathan</hi> interprets <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 21.
which is a Repetition of the foresaid <hi>Law of Tali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
the Offender was to make a sufficient Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.
And thus the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
among the Grecians, and the <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> among
the Romans was understood, <hi>viz.</hi> not of an Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
but an Analogical Compensation. An Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
was accepted, the Value of an Eye, a
Tooth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Eye or Tooth it self. 2. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi>
the diverse kinds of which are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set down in the beginning of <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. as first,
when the <hi>same.</hi> thing that was taken away is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the Owner, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. or when the <hi>like</hi>
thing is restored, <hi>v.</hi> 5. or when <hi>more</hi> is returned
than was taken away, <hi>ver. 1, 4. viz.</hi> in the Case of
Thest, where <hi>twofold,</hi> sometimes <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five-fold,</hi>
(according as the Circumstances of the Fault were)
Yea <hi>seven-fold</hi> sometimes was to be restored,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 31. or, when the Thief had nothing to
make Satisfaction with, he was to be sold, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
was to be made to the Owner with that
Money, <hi>Exod. 22. 3. 3. Imprisonment,</hi> keeping the
Body of the Man in Custody for his Fault. And
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46315:505"/>
thence this Place of Consinement is called <hi>the House
of Custody,</hi> 2 Sam. 20. 3. and by the Chaldee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrast
<hi>the House of Detention,</hi> Isa. 24. 22. Thus
King <hi>Asa</hi> clapp'd the Prophet <hi>Hanani</hi> into <hi>Prison</hi>
for reproving him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 10. King <hi>Ahab</hi>
commanded <hi>Micaiah</hi> to be sent to the like Place,
because he prophesied against him, 1 <hi>Kings 22. 27.
Ieremiah</hi> was put into <hi>the Court of the Prison</hi> by King
<hi>Zedekiah</hi> for the same Offence, <hi>Ier. 37. 21. Iohn
the Baptist was imprisoned</hi> by <hi>Herod,</hi> Mat. 4. 12. and
so was St. <hi>Peter</hi> by another of that Name, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 4.
This also was antiently the Place to receive those
that <hi>were in Debt,</hi> Mat. 18. 30. and such as had
committed <hi>Murder,</hi> Luke 23. 19. We read of
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> a <hi>Common Prison,</hi> a Publick Jail,
<hi>Acts</hi> 5. 18. a Place of Durance and Consinement
for the worst sort of Offenders. In their Prisons
there was usually a <hi>Dungeon,</hi> Jer. 38. 6. or a <hi>Pit,</hi>
as the Hebrew Word <hi>Bor</hi> is rendred in other Places
when it hath reference to a <hi>Prison,</hi> as in <hi>Isa. 24. 22.
Zech.</hi> 9. 11. And from this Word we gather what
was the Nature of the <hi>Dungeon, viz.</hi> that it was a
Place dug deep in the Ground so as to let in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
(for that is imported by <hi>Bor, Puteus, Fovea</hi>)
whereby the Place became miry; and accordingly
we read that <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> who was cast into this
worst and lowest part of the Prison, <hi>sunk in the
Mire,</hi> Jer. 38. 6. It is no wonder therefore that
the Hebrew Word is translated by the LXX
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

the Hebrew) <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 29. It might be observed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46315:506"/>
out of those Authors who have given an Account
of these Subterraneous Dungeons, that they were
<hi>deep;</hi> and thence <gap reason="foreign">

the Punishment by <hi>the Ship of the Sucker;</hi> and
by this they use to signify any <hi>Close Prison,</hi> and even
that more particular Consinement of the Hands or
Feet in Prison: Accordingly an Eminent Rabbin
thinks it imports <hi>Hand-shackles;</hi> another, that it
signifies <hi>Fetters for the Feet.</hi> That there was such
an Antient Punishment as the <hi>Stocks,</hi> is evident from
<hi>Iob 13. 27. &amp;</hi> 33. 11. where the Hebrew Word
is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, rendred in the former Place <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. The other Place which I alledg
is in the New Testament, <hi>Acts 16. 24. He thrust
them into the inner Prison, and made their Feet fast in
the Stocks.</hi> Where observe there was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
to distinguish this Place from the other Parts
of the Prison: and this it is likely was the <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi>
the <hi>Pit</hi> spoken of before; and here was
placed <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, (for that is the Word here used)
<hi>the Wooden Stocks; lignea custodia,</hi> as <hi>Plautus</hi> calls
it; which was both to secure Offenders, and to
put them to pain. I confess this Text speaks of
the Prison at <hi>Philippi,</hi> but I suppose as to this there
was little difference between the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Jails, especially if you take notice of what the
other Text before mentioned acquaints us with.
There is another Word, <hi>viz.</hi>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which we
render <hi>the Stocks,</hi> Jer. 20. 2, 3. and seems to me
to be some Uneasy Place in the Prison into which
<hi>Ieremiah</hi> was cast, and so it confirms the former
Notion I offer'd. We read of <hi>the Correction of the
Stocks,</hi> Prov. 7. 22. but what the Hebrew Word
<hi>gnekes</hi> properly signifies is difficult to determine,
only we know that it was some Exemplary Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to teach <hi>a Fool</hi> Wisdom: these <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (as
the Seventy render it) were to bind him to his
good Behaviour. 4. <hi>Scourging</hi> was another Penal
Infliction, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 2. where we find that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46315:507"/>
fender was to receive fourty Stripes according to
the Rigour of the Law, but thirty nine was the
usual Tale, as all the Jewish Writers affirm, and
as we may gather from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24. This <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellation</hi>
is called <hi>Bikkoreth,</hi> Lev. 19. 20. from <hi>bakar
bos,</hi> it being done with Scourges made of <hi>Bulls
Hides</hi> or <hi>Ox-leather;</hi> which we also find confirmed
by several Classick Authors. Our Blessed Saviour
underwent this severe Penalty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 26. and
foretold his Disciples that it should be their Lot,
<hi>Mat. 10. 17. &amp;</hi> 23. 34. which was fulfilled, <hi>Acts</hi>
5. 40. &amp; 22. 10. The most grievous sort of
Scourging was with <hi>Scorpions,</hi> 1 Kings 12. 11. <hi>i. e.</hi>
with Whips, to which were fastned Pricks and
sharp Thorns, to rend and tear the Body: and
sometimes there were Plummets of Lead at the End
of them, to bruise and batter the Flesh. Scourging
was also a <hi>Roman</hi> Punishment, as is evident from
<hi>Acts</hi> 22. 24. besides that the best Pagan Histories
attest this: yet there was some Difference between
this Penalty as it was inflicted by them and by the
Jews; for the former used both Rods and Whips,
but the latter chastised Offenders with Whips on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which were much more painful and grievous.
St. <hi>Paul</hi> (who, as he confesses himself, used <hi>to beat
in every Synagogue those that believed on Iesus,</hi> Acts
22. 19.) felt the Severity of both; <hi>Of the Iews</hi>
(saith he) <hi>received I forty Stripes save one,</hi> 2 Cor.
11. 24. <hi>Thrice was I beaten with Rods,</hi> ver. 25. which
refers to this Punishment which was inflicted on
him by the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 23.</p>
                     <p>These were the <hi>Lesser Punishments</hi> among the
Jews: we are moreover informed from the Sacred
Writ what the <hi>Capital</hi> ones were. These, as to
the particular manner of executing them, and as
to the Usages and Customs that attended them, are
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46315:507"/>
particularly spoken of in the Talmud, and are
treated of by <hi>Maimonides,</hi> and by our Learned
Dr. <hi>Godwin:</hi> but I am to consider them as they are
mention'd in <hi>Scripture,</hi> for that is my Business at
present. And though the Talmudists distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Lesser Deaths,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
those that are more <hi>Grievous;</hi> yet because I find
that the Jewish Writers do not fully agree what
particular Capital Punishments are to be referr'd
to these two Heads, I will lay this Distinction
aside, and proceed in this order. First, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>Killing with the Sword,</hi> or <hi>Beheading,</hi> was in use
among them; and though I do not find it among
their <hi>Iudicial Laws,</hi> yet there are some <hi>Examples</hi>
of this sort of Death recorded. <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> was the
first that was slain so, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 7. though it is true
this Execution was without Law, yet it shews what
way of Death was used<note n="1" place="bottom">Lev. 20. 2, 27. &amp; 24. 14. Dent. 13. 10. &amp; 17. 5. &amp; 21. 21. &amp; 22. 21, 24.</note> among them in those days.
We may observe that 'tis said, <hi>They smote him, and
slew him,</hi> and then <hi>beheaded him:</hi> The severing the
Head from the Body was a Consequent of some
foregoing Violence, whereby his Life was taken
away. Indeed, that it was usual to cut off the
Head after the Person was slain, and to bring it in
a way of Trophy, may be proved from many
Instances, as that of <hi>Sisera,</hi> Judg. 5. 26. <hi>Goliah,</hi>
1 Sam. 17. 57. <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 31. 9. <hi>Sheba,</hi> 2 Sam.
20. 22. And perhaps in those Days and afterwards
the beheading of Persons alive was not the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
among the Jews; but they rather took off
their Heads (either by cutting them off with a
Sword, or chopping them off on a Block with an
Ax) after they had dispatch'd them by some other
Means. For, as I apprehend, the <hi>Decollation</hi> was
only for Pomp, and to expose the Malefactors.
Nor in the Account that is given of the beheading
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46315:508"/>
                        <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> Mark 6. 24. (which is another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this Punishment in the Holy Book) do I
meet with any thing to disprove that his Life was
first taken away by the <hi>Executioner whom</hi> Herod <hi>sent,</hi>
and then his Head was cut off, <hi>to be brought in a
Charger,</hi> to be shown in a way of Triumph. It
is probable that when 'tis said St. <hi>James was killed
with the Sword,</hi> Acts 12. 2. it is meant of that
<hi>Killing</hi> which preceded <hi>Beheading,</hi> which, as some
Ecclesiastical Writers tell us, was inflicted on that
Apostle. I will only add, that the Hebrew Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
inform us, that this was the Deadly Penalty
of Men-slayers, Murderers, such as apostatized to
Idolatry, or that enticed others to it.</p>
                     <p>Another Mortal Punishment was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Stoning,</hi>
which was wont to be performed first by one of
the Witnesses against the Malefactor, and then all
the People followed him. This <hi>Lapidation</hi> was
used 'towards Blasphemers, Idolaters, Incestuous
Persons, Witches, Wizards, Prophaners of the
Sabbath; those that inveigled others to Idolatry;
Children that cursed their Parents, or rebelled
against them. In the Old Testament the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of this Punishment are <hi>Achan,</hi> Josh. 7. 25.
<hi>Adoram,</hi> Kings 12. 18. <hi>Naboth,</hi> I Kings 21. 10.
<hi>Zechariah,</hi> 2 Chron. 24. 1. In the New Testament
we read that they attempted to stone our Saviour,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 31. and that they effectually did so to
<hi>St. Stephen,</hi> Acts 7. 58. and that they exercised this
Severity on St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but by the singular Providence
of God he escaped with his Life, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 19.
This was the most General Punishment that was
denounced in the Law against notorious Criminals;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46315:508"/>
yea by those indesinite Terms of <hi>putting to Death,</hi>
is sometimes meant this sort of Exemplary Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion,
as in <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. 10. (compared with
<hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 5.) and other Places.</p>
                     <p>Another severe Punishment was <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
which was by the Mosaick Law executed on
some sort of Incestuous Persons, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <note n="1" place="bottom">Lev. 20. 14.</note> those that
vitiated their own Daughters, and<note n="2" place="bottom">Lev. 21. 19.</note> on the Priest's
Daughter that committed Whoredom, and on Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
of a far different Nature, as appears from
<hi>Achan</hi>'s Example. Some think they were burnt
alive, as some Criminals amongst us are: Others
say, that before they were burnt they were stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,
and then melted Lead was poured down their
Throats, and afterwards their whole Bodies were
consumed in the Fire. This is certain, that <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
was a secondary Penalty, that is, it followed
upon some other going before, as we may infer
from what we read concerning this Punitive way
of dealing with <hi>Achan</hi> and his Family; <hi>All</hi> Israel
<hi>stoned him with Stones, and burned them with Fire after
they had stoned them with Stones,</hi> Josh. 7. 25. I might
observe further that this Penal Course was taken
with Harlots and Prostitutes before the Judicial
Law: Thus the Doom which <hi>Iudah</hi> pronounced
against <hi>Tamar</hi> for her Whoredom was, <hi>Let her be
burnt,</hi> Gen. 38. 24. And I propound it, whether
it be not reasonable to think, that [<hi>She shall be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
burnt with Fire</hi>] Rev. 18. 8. is an Allusion to
this Antient and Legal Punishment of <hi>Whoredom,</hi>
seeing we find that <hi>Babylon</hi> (who is meant in those
Words) is signally stiled a <hi>Whore,</hi> and her <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is twice mentioned in the third Verse of that
Chapter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:46315:509"/>
Again, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Hanging</hi> was in use among the
Jews, <hi>Numb. 25. 4. Deut.</hi> 21. 22. but it was of a
different Nature from that which is among us. For
First, they were hang'd up by the Hands, not by
the Head or Neck. Secondly, this Suspension was
not while they were alive, but after they were
dead. Thirdly, it was seldom or never used alone,
but in conjunction with one or other of those Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
before (or after to be) mention'd. Some
hold that it was used only after <hi>Stoning,</hi> and was
the Recompence of Blasphemy and Idolatry. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
say, it was generally the Consequent of <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling.</hi>
This is not to be doubted that it was a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
Punishment, as well as that which I before
mentioned. First they were dispatch'd, and then
they were hung up upon a Tree, Gibbet, or Stake,
to be seen and taken notice of, to be made Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary,
and to be a Warning and Terror to others.
Therefore when the Sun went down, <hi>i. e.</hi> when
they could no longer be a Publick Spectacle, they
were taken down from the Place where they hung,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. And from <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10. 26. it appears
that this was a Subsequent Punishment, for 'tis said,
Joshua <hi>hang'd five Kings on five Trees,</hi> but he first
<hi>smote them and slew them.</hi> In the same manner 'tis
likely he dealt with the King of <hi>Ai,</hi> Josh. 8. 29.
whom he hanged. And the same may be thought of
<hi>Saul's</hi> seven Sons, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 9. This is particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressed in <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 4, 5. where both <hi>hanging
up</hi> and <hi>slaying</hi> are mentioned as the Punishment of
some scandalous Sinners in the Wilderness: where
by the way observe, that this was the Penalty of
Whoredom as well as Blasphemy and Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>I know <hi>Suffocation</hi> or <hi>Strangling</hi> (which is by the
Jews called <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) is reckoned as a <hi>Capital</hi> Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
among the Jews, but I do not find it expresly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46315:509"/>
named, unless <hi>Machanak,</hi> which <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <hi>his Soul
chose,</hi> ch. 7. 15. be a Reference to this sort of Death.
But we are to remember that <hi>Iob</hi> was no Jew, and
therefore 'tis improbable he speaks of a Jewish Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
But if we may credit <hi>R. Solomon</hi> and
other Hebrew Doctors, this is often mentioned in
the Mosaick Law; for they say this is meant in those
Places of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and other Parts of the Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch,
where 'tis commanded that the Criminal
<hi>shall die,</hi> or <hi>be put to Death.</hi> So in <hi>Lev. 20. 10.
The Adulterer and Adulteress shall surely be put to
Death:</hi> the Targum of <hi>Ionathan</hi> interprets it of
<hi>Suffocation.</hi> And so it doth in <hi>Exod. 21. 15. Deut.
22.</hi> 22. This absolute way of speaking signifies
this particular Species of putting Persons to Death,
they say. But from what hath been suggested be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
we may infer that this is not always true:
however, it may be so generally and for the most
part; and accordingly from the respective Texts
we may gather, that the Offenders that were stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
were those that carnally knew the Priest's
Daughter, or another Man's Wife, and those that
struck their Father or Mother; and all Lying Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
or that prophesied in the Name of a false
God. The way, they tell us, of <hi>Strangling</hi> was
with a Towel, Napkin, or any Linen Cloth put
about the Malefactor's Neck, and drawn by two
Men with Force contrary ways.</p>
                     <p>Another Punitive Infliction, though not specified
in the Judicial Law, nor reckon'd up by the Rabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Masters among the Jewish Punishments, was
<hi>the Wheel,</hi> as we are acquainted from what <hi>Solomon</hi>
faith, and without doubt concerning himself, <hi>A
wise King bringeth the Wheel over the Wicked,</hi> Prov.
20. 26. This was used of old not only in Rackings
of Persons to make them confess, but to take away
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:46315:510"/>
their Lives. They were tied unto it, or extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon it, and so drawn and broken. That this
was used by <hi>Antiochus</hi> toward the Jews, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the Macchabean Brethren, is attested in the
<hi>Apochryphal</hi> Writings; and that the Pagan Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
made use of it upon the Christian Martyrs,
we learn from Ecclosiaitical History.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, <hi>Tebigna<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

read in <hi>Mat. 18. 6. Mark</hi> 9. 42. is reckon'd by
St. <hi>Ierom</hi> on the former Place among the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Jewish Nation: and so it is by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saubon</hi>
in his Notes. And<note n="1" place="bottom">Chald. Lexic.</note> 
                        <hi>Buxiorf</hi> hints that
some were condemned to this Punishment among
the <hi>Iews,</hi> and were signally said to be <hi>Men adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be drown'd.</hi> But whether it was really so, or
was a Punishment proper to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> I will not
here dispute, but proceed to speak of Another
which undoubtedly was <hi>Iewish,</hi> and is oftner men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in the Old Testament, especially in <hi>Moses's</hi>
Writings, where the Jewish Penalties are fixed,
than any of those before named. It is <hi>being cut
off from Israel, or the Soul's being cut off from among
the People:</hi> concerning which there are as many
various Opinions, as about any one thing that I
know of this Nature. This <hi>Chereth</hi> or <hi>Cutting off</hi>
is thought by the Jewish Doctors to be peculiar
to the Jewish Occonomy: but in this first Essay of
their Sentiments about it they are mistaken, for
this Penalty is expresly taken notice of before the
Judicial Law, in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14.
God saith of the uncircumcised Manchild, that
<hi>that Soul shall be cut off from his People:</hi> therefore
'tis plain that this Infliction, whatever it was, was
not peculiar to the Mosaick Dispensation. The
Hebrew Expositors all agree in this, that by this
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46315:510"/>
                        <hi>Excision</hi> is meant a Divine Punishment, <hi>i. e.</hi> some
Judgment immediately sent by God: but they
agree not as to the particular kind of it. It signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
Sudden Death, saith <hi>R. Saadias,</hi> who expounds
it by those Words, <hi>Psal. 55. 23. They shall not live
out half their Days.</hi> Another of the Rabbies, <hi>Sol.
Iarchi,</hi> understands it of Barreness or want of
Children. When Persons are threatned to be <hi>cut
off,</hi> their Seed, their Posterity is meant, he saith.
Again, some of the Jews think that Eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in another World are here intended. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
think it is meant of the Excision of both
Body and Soul: the former is cut off here by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely
Death, the latter by being separated from
God and Happiness in the Life to come, saith
<hi>Abarbanel.</hi> The famous <hi>Maimonides</hi> goes higher,
and saith it signifies not only the shortning of Life
here, but the utter Extinction and Annihilation of
the Soul hereafter, so that a Man perishes like a
Beast. <hi>Christians</hi> also (as well as <hi>Iews</hi>) have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Opinions concerning this, for some of them
understand it of some Capital Punishment to be
inflicted by the Civil Magistrate, such as Stoning,
Burning, &amp;c. according to the Nature and Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Offence. Others believe an Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Punishment is designed here, <hi>viz.</hi> Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication:
This is the general perswasion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of <hi>Geneva.</hi> Some interpret it of Sudden
and Immature Death, as <hi>L' Empereur</hi> and <hi>Grotius.</hi>
Others think Eternal Damnation is meant. <hi>Iuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
will have it to be both Excommunication and
Damnation. Upon a View of the Whole, and
weighing the several Places where this <hi>Chereth</hi> is
mention'd, I doubt not but I may most rationally
determine that according to the Subject Matter of
the Texts, this Punishment is to be differently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46315:511"/>
derstood. That is, where this <hi>Excision</hi> is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for such an Offence as was not punishable by
the Jewish Laws, it is meant of some Divine Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
some Plague immediately to be inflicted by
God himself. But where this <hi>Cutting off</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
for a Sin which the Law of the Jews and
their Courts of Justice took notice of and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,
it is likely it is then to be understood of
such a kind of Punishment as the Law inflicted,
as some kind of <hi>Bodily Death,</hi> or <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
In this latter acception the <hi>Chereth</hi> was used, when
for some great Offence a Man was excluded from
Ecclesiastical Communion, debarr'd the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
cut off from being a Member of the Church.
Thus the <hi>Chereth</hi> is the same with <hi>Cherem,</hi> which was
the middle sort of Excommunication among the
Jews, between <hi>Nidui</hi> which was a Separation from
Company and Converse, and <hi>Shammata</hi> which was
a Devoting to Satan and utter Destruction. Thus
you see what Course they took in those early Times
to animadvert on those that were Faulty: and it is
the more considerable because it was of God's own
Appointment. Hence we conclude these Inflictions
were appointed and executed with great Reason
and Equity, with singular Wisdom and Prudence,
and such as became the Divine Author of them,
and the All-Wise Governour of that People.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be expected I should insist on the
<hi>Particular Laws</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> of their Civil
Government, they being so Many and Various.
These may be consulted in the Old Testament
it self, which presents us with the most Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Rules of Civil Polity, and such as to a
great Part of them are sitted to the Governments
of all Nations in the World. The Greeks were
famous for their Laws, and so were the Old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:46315:511"/>
who borrowed a considerable Part of their
Laws from them, and particularly caused those of
the <hi>Twelve Tables</hi> (the first beginning of their
Laws) to be fetch'd thence by their <hi>Decemviri:</hi>
and we see they contain Excellent Things in them.
And the Encomiums of the Learnedest Men are
large on the <hi>Laws of the Empire:</hi> the <hi>Pandects</hi> are
fraught with the Decisions and Responses of Wise
and Experienced Lawyers, and the <hi>Code</hi> is famed

Such were the Laws of the <hi>Iews</hi> which in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Volume are transmitted to us, and consequently
they far surpass, they infinitely surmount all others
under Heaven. And no Laws whatsoever were
<hi>prior</hi> to these, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> against <hi>Appion</hi> very clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

had no Written Laws at first. <hi>Tully, Livy, Iustin</hi>
and other Historians acquaint us, that the Verbal
Commands of Kings and Princes were their Laws.
But afterward when they had Laws committed
to writing, (such as could <hi>be read,</hi> whence they
had the Name of <hi>Leges</hi>) they derived them from
the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> more especially it might be proved,
that the Antientest Attick and Roman Laws were
borrowed from <hi>Moses,</hi> and that other Wise Law
givers and Rulers have taken some of their best
Constitutions hence.</p>
                     <p>Then in the next place, if we look abroad, and
enquire into the <hi>Government of the Heathen Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
we shall there also be assisted by the Anitent
Records of the Bible: and as to many things that
concern their Kings and Government, we cannot
inform our selves otherwise than from this Sacred
History. Here we read of four Eastern <hi>Kings,</hi>
(such as they were, for <hi>Melech</hi> is a large Word,
and signifies any Ruler) the <hi>King of Shinar,</hi> the
<hi>King of Ellasar,</hi> the <hi>King of Elam,</hi> the <hi>King of
Nations;</hi> Gen. 14. 1, 2. Which were the first
peepings out of the Kingdoms of <hi>Babylon, Assyria,
Persia</hi> and <hi>Greece:</hi> for <hi>Shinar is Babylon</hi> (as all agree)
<hi>Ellasar</hi> is <hi>Assyria,</hi> (some Region near to <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
as may be gather'd from <hi>Isa. 37. 12.) Elam</hi> is the
usual Name of <hi>Persia,</hi> and by <hi>Nations</hi> is meant
<hi>Greece,</hi> especially the Grecian Isles where there was
a great Conflux of several <hi>Nations.</hi> But these Names
are not to be taken in this Extent here, for we
cannot suppose that Five Great Kings (and some
of them of very distant Countries) would come
to sight the King of <hi>Sodom</hi> a Petty Prince. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46315:512"/>
the <hi>Places</hi> here nam'd, must not be thought to
be those Wide Regions which afterwards were
known by those Names: and the <hi>Persons</hi> who are
here call'd <hi>Kings</hi> must not be conceived to be any
other than Governours or Magistrates of Cities,
for so the Title of <hi>King</hi> is to be understood in
some Texts of the Old Testament, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
in this History, where <hi>the five Kings of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>
are mention'd. We read that <hi>Abimelech</hi>
(which afterwards became the Name of the Kings
of <hi>Palestine</hi>) was one of the first Kings of this
Countrey, and that the particular Seat of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was <hi>Gerar,</hi> Gen. 20. 2. We are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
that about this time (which was about
400 Years after the Flood) there were <hi>Kings</hi> of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and that <hi>Pharaob</hi> was the Royal Name
even then, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 15. No Book that we can
trust to make mention of these Early Kingdoms,
and Royal Thrones (such as they were) but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s
History. Yea, here is a considerable Account
of the <hi>Four Grand Monarchies</hi> or Empires of the
World, as they are usually stiled. We are told
here that <hi>Nimrod</hi> was <hi>a Mighty One in the Earth,
Gen.</hi> 10. 8. and a <hi>Mighty Hunter before the Lord,
v.</hi> 9. by which Character, and what we may infer
from it, it appears that he was the First that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd
an Imperial and Kingly Power in the
World, though he hath not here the Title of
<hi>King.</hi> The Word <hi>[Gibbor]</hi> which we render
<hi>[Mighty]</hi> is in the Version of the <hi>Seventy</hi> a <hi>Giant,</hi>
which expresseth not only the Greatnes of his
Stature, but the Exorbitancy of his Power which
he exerted over others with an Unlimited Sway
and Arbitrariness. And when 'tis said he was
a <hi>Mighty Hunter,</hi> I grant it may set forth what
Warlike Exercise he was given to, as <hi>Livy</hi> remarks
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46315:513"/>
of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus,</hi> that they were addicted
to this Manly Recreation, and that it was a Sign
of the Vigour of their Minds, and the Strength and
Agility of their Bodies: and so <hi>Xenophon</hi> in the
Life of <hi>Cyrus</hi> observes, that it is a Military Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
and becoming a Great Man. But I conceive
there is something more intimated to us in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
represented as a <hi>Hunter</hi> and a <hi>Mighty Hunter,</hi>
and <hi>before the Lord;</hi> for this may signify to us his
Fierce Pursuit of Men as well as Beasts, his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizing
and usurping Dominion over the People,
and that in desiance of God, <hi>before whom</hi> he was not
ashamed to act thus wickedly. He was of the
Race of <hi>Chush</hi> the Son of <hi>Cham,</hi> and was the Head
and Ringleader of those Miscreants that built <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi>
or <hi>Babylon:</hi> which baffles the common Account
of Pagan Historians, who tell us that <hi>Semiramis,
Ninus</hi>'s Queen, was the first Founder of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
unless we understand by it that she finish'd the
Work. He it was that with the Remains of the
Babylonian Crew set up here the <hi>First Empire:</hi>
which began soon after the Flood, <hi>viz.</hi> about 130
Years. This is the Date of the First Monarchy
in the World, and <hi>Babel</hi> was the Place where it
commenced. It is expresly said, <hi>The beginning of
his Kingdom was</hi> Babel, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 10. This was
the first Step to the Universal Empire of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans
or Assyrians, which afterwards spread it
self to vast and almost unlimited Dimensions.
This is he that by the Pagan Writers is call'd <hi>Belus,</hi>
and said to be the Father of <hi>Ninus,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius,
Ierom,</hi> and other of the Learnedest among the
Antients agree: for this is observable (and I have
proved from several Instances in another Place)
that oftentimes the same Persons have not the same
Names in Prophane History that are given them
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46315:513"/>
in the Sacred one. Some read <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 11. thus,
<hi>He went out of the Land into Assyria,</hi> and thence ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that though <hi>Nimrod</hi> was first seated at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
and reign'd in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> yet from thence he
pierced into <hi>Assyria,</hi> where he built <hi>Nineveh,</hi> the
Head City of the Assyrian Monarchy. But this
is unquestionable that the Empire was translated
into <hi>Assyria,</hi> and thence there is a Distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Land of Assyria</hi> and the <hi>Land of Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod,</hi>
Mic. 5. 6. The Sacred Writings also acquaint
us, that as this Monarchy began at <hi>Babylon</hi> and
<hi>Chaldea,</hi> and was translated into <hi>Assyria,</hi> so at last
it returned to <hi>Babylon</hi> again, the Assyrian Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasties
being swallow'd up of those of <hi>Chaldea.</hi>
So the <hi>Assyrians laid the Foundation for the Chaldeans,
they set up the Towers thereof, they raised up the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
thereof,</hi> Isa. 23. 13. And this Relapse or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of the Assyrian Government to the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians
is again foretold in Ezek. 31. 11, 12, &amp;c.
<hi>I have deliver'd him into the Hand of the mighty One of
the Heathens, he shall surely deal with him.</hi> King
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is that <hi>El gojim,</hi> that <hi>God of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
(for so 'tis in the Hebrew) who made them all
bow down to him and worshi him, and he more
especially made the <hi>Assyrians</hi> truckle to his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Soveraignty. This is very carefully to
be heeded, because it gives Light to the whole
History both Sacred and Prophane, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
the Affairs of those Kingdoms. The want
of attending to this is the reason why several that
have writ of these things have egregiously blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
confounding one part of the Empire with
another, making no difference between Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
and Assyrians, and thereby rendring all a
mere <hi>Babel,</hi> a Confusion. But we are directed by
what the <hi>Sacred History</hi> suggests, to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46315:514"/>
the two neighbouring Dynasties of <hi>Assyria</hi>
and <hi>Chaldea,</hi> which alternately made up the First
Monarchy. Sometimes the Babylonian Princes bore
sway, and were Heads of the Empire; at other
times those of the Assyrian Race climb'd to this
Honour. <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Nineveh</hi> were the two Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Seats belonging to each: when the Chaldean
Kings prevail'd, then the former was their Place
of residence; when the Assyrian Monarchs bare
Rule, the latter was the Place where they kept
their Court. The brief Scheme of the Successions
is this: At first all <hi>Assyria</hi> was subject to <hi>Babylon</hi>
or <hi>Chaldea:</hi> next the Babylonian Power gave way
to the Assyrian: after this the Assyrians lost the
Monarchy, it coming again to the Chaldeans, yet
so that the Empire was then divided, for the <hi>Medes</hi>
had a Part, though the greatest Share went to the
<hi>Babylonians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Where by the way we may observe, that that
which is call'd and reputed the <hi>First Monarchy</hi> may
as well be said to be the <hi>Third:</hi> it may be counted
Two at least. And thence it will follow that that
which is vulgarly call'd the <hi>2d Monarchy</hi> was the
<hi>3d</hi> or <hi>4th;</hi> for before the Persian Monarchy there
was the Babylonian, Assyrian and Median. Here, if
the Reader would pardon the Digression, it might
be further prov'd, that the common Division of the
<hi>Monarchies</hi> into four, and no more, is imperfect
and groundless: for there were several other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Dynasties or Kingdoms in the time of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrian
Monarchs; there were the Kingdoms of the
Old Germans, Egyptians, Argives, Athenians,
Lacedemonians, Tyrians, Romans, Jews. So the
<hi>Greek</hi> Monarchy (which is reckon'd the Third)
was divided into four Kingdoms. Likewise, with
the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours were contemporary the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46315:514"/>
                        <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours in the East. Besides, if we
should come down lower, it would appear that
<hi>Mabomet's Dove</hi> hath been as wonderful in the
World as the <hi>Roman Eagle:</hi> the <hi>Turkish Monarchy</hi>
hath grasped more than the <hi>Roman,</hi> and might
challenge to be numbred among the most <hi>Celebrated
Monarchies.</hi> For these reasons I am apt to be of
<note n="1" place="bottom">Method. Hist. Cap. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Bodinus</hi>'s Mind, that we ought to reckon more Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
than Four. But I will not now contend,
especially because it is likely the Interpretation of
those Dreams and Visions in <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning the
<hi>Four Beasts</hi> and the <hi>Four Metals,</hi> gave the first Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to this number of <hi>Four Monarchies,</hi> and no
more. To return then to our former Matter, <hi>viz.</hi>
The Difference which the Old Testament directs
us to take notice of between the Assyrian and Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean
Empires, which some have so shuffled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that they cannot distinctly be discern'd. These
Inspired Writings let us know that the First Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
of the Jews was under the former, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
under the latter; that the Kings of <hi>Assyria</hi>
were those properly who reign'd in <hi>Nineve,</hi> and
that strictly speaking the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> were
those that resided at <hi>Babylon:</hi> though 'tis true by
reason of the Vicissitude of the Government of
the Assyrians and Chaldeans, these are <hi>sometimes</hi>
call'd the Kings of <hi>Assyria;</hi> and the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>
and of <hi>Assyria</hi> is the same. It is from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Records
that we are informed that<note n="2" place="bottom">Kings 24. 12. Jer. 39. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
in the eighth Year of his Reign, transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Iehoiakin</hi> the King, and other of the Jews to
<hi>Babylon,</hi> and that in his eighteenth Year he utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroyed <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and carried away Captive
<hi>Zedekiah</hi> and the greatest Part of the Jews, from
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:46315:515"/>
which time are to be numbred the Seventy Years
of the Babylonian Captivity. This was <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi>
the Great, he who brought that Monarchy
to its highest Pitch, insomuch that some have rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
him the First Absolute Monarch. Many
other remarkable Passages relating to the whole
Series of this Government, and those that presided
in it from first to last, are set down in the Holy
Writ. Several of the very individual Persons who
were the Chief Monarchs of this first and antientest
Empire, are here particularly mention'd, with the
considerable Actions and Events appertaining to
them: as <hi>Pul,</hi> 2 Kings 15. 19. <hi>Tiglath-Pileser,</hi>
1 Chron. 5. 26. <hi>Salmanassar,</hi> 2 Kings 17. 3.
Hos. 10. 14. <hi>Senacherib,</hi> 2 Kings 18. 3. <hi>Esarhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
2 Kings 19. 37. <hi>Merodach-Baladan,</hi> 2 Kings
20. 20. Isa. 39. 1. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> mention'd in the
Books of the <hi>Kings, Chronicles, Ieremiah, Ezekiel,
Daniel:</hi> and lastly <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> Dan. 5. 22. in whom
this Monarchy had its Period. And so these Sacred
Writings acquaint us not only with the Rise but
the Progress, Duration and End of this Empire;
hence we learn that it lasted from <hi>Nimrod</hi> to the
close of <hi>Belshazzar</hi>'s Reign, <hi>i. e.</hi> from the year of
the World 1717. to the Year 3419. which is in
all 1702 Years; a much longer time than any of
the other Monarchies endured.</p>
                     <p>Again, in these Writings is recorded the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of the Next, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> (usually known
by the Name of the <hi>Second) Monarchy.</hi> Here we
read that <hi>Belshazzar,</hi> the last Chaldean Monarch,
he that impiously carouzed in the Holy Vessels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Temple, was slain by <hi>Darius</hi> the
<hi>Mcde, Dan.</hi> 5. 30, 31. who joined with <hi>Cyrus</hi> the
Persian in the Expedition against <hi>Belshazzar;</hi> and
they both had Right to the Babylonian Monarchy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46315:515"/>
on that Account, and accordingly jointly ruled:
so it was a <hi>Medo-Persian</hi> Monarchy. <hi>Darius</hi> is
spoken of in the <hi>6th</hi> and <hi>9th</hi> Chapters of <hi>Daniel;</hi>
but being aged before he came to the Throne, he
lived but about two Years after; whereupon <hi>Cyrus</hi>
reigned alone, and is generally reputed the First
Founder of the Persian Monarchy. This famous
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> sirnamed <hi>the Great,</hi> was prophesied of long
before he appeared in the World, <hi>Isa. 44. 28. &amp;
45.</hi> 1. This is he that was the Happy Restorer of
the Jews to their own Country, and was a great
Favourer of the Pious of that Nation, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 1. And
in the following Chapters, and in the Book of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi>
is infallibly related what <hi>Persian</hi> Kings hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the Building of the Temple, and who they
were that promoted it. Besides, the Book of
<hi>Esther,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Daniel,</hi> are a Narrative
of what was done under the Kings of <hi>Persia.</hi>
Next, it might be added, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great
the First Founder of the <hi>Grecian Monarchy,</hi> is spoken
of in these Sacred Writings, as in Dan. 2. 32, 39.
&amp; 7. 6. &amp; 8. 5, 6, 7, 8. &amp; 10. 20. &amp; 11. 3, 4.
whence<note n="1" place="bottom">Joseph, Antiq. Jud. 1. 11. c. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Iaddus</hi> the High Priest shewed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of <hi>Daniel</hi> to that Great Monarch, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
turned to that Place where his Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Persians, and the Translation of the
Empire to him, are foretold. Here also the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Empire among his <hi>Captains</hi> is predicted,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 33. &amp; 7. 7, 19. &amp; 8. 22. &amp; 11. 5, 6, &amp;c.
Lastly, the History of the <hi>New Testament</hi> mentions
the Author and Erecter of the <hi>Roman</hi> (which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
passes for the <hi>Fourth) Monarchy,</hi> and some of
his Actions and Decrees. This was <hi>Augustus,</hi> for

and cherish the Plants, to preserve the Fruits from
the Beasts and Fowls, which had Admittance into
that Place, (as we read in <hi>Gen. 2. 19, 20.)</hi> and to
keep all things in good order as a skilful <hi>Gardiner</hi>
and <hi>Husbandman;</hi> for both these made up the
First Employment and Trade in the World. And
when Man was ejected out of Paradise, he was still
set about the same Work, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 23. for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Word that is used here is the same with that
<hi>in ver.</hi> 15. and is translated there to <hi>dress:</hi> but it
is certain that <hi>gnamad</hi> (which is the Verb in both
Places) is of a large Import, and signifies all Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandly
managing and improving of Ground. And
truly there was more need of exercising that Art
now than before, the Earth being not a little enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged
by the <hi>Curse</hi> which God denounced against
it, and executed upon it; which was one Reason
why <hi>Adam</hi> brought up his Son <hi>Cain</hi> to <hi>Husbandry</hi>
and <hi>Tilling the Ground,</hi> Gen. 4. 2. for now it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Manuring and Cultivating. And as this his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
Son was brought up to take care of the Fruits
of the Earth, so his next was bred up to <hi>feeding of
Sheep,</hi> which is the Second Employment or Calling
that we read of in the World. Afterwards <hi>Iabal</hi>
advanced higher, and became the First <hi>Grasier;</hi>
for so I understand those Words, <hi>Gen. 4. 20. He
was the Father of such as have Cattel, i. e.</hi> that have
other Cattel besides <hi>Sheep;</hi> for <hi>these,</hi> and the <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
or <hi>feeding</hi> of them, had been mention'd before.
He lived upon <hi>Pasturage,</hi> and for that purpose was
<hi>the Father of such as dwell in Tents,</hi> as it is said in the
same Place: The Meaning of which is, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
others generally lived in one fix'd Place and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
he and others of his Calling went from
one place to another feeding: They travell'd as
their Cattel did, and for this Reason it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:46315:517"/>
to have <hi>Tents.</hi> Accordingly that they might
look after their Flocks and Herds the better, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
these, that they might lie out in the Fields
all Night under this Shelter. Thus you see what
was the Primitive State of things; <hi>Adain</hi> and his
first-born Son were Husbandmen, and his second
Son a Shepherd; and others of his Race were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
in feeding of Cattel. Such was the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those that were the First Heirs of the
World.</p>
                     <p>And so for a long time after, in the first and
most uncorrupted Ages, this was the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Greatest Persons. In those more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Times of the World the Wealthiest Men
imbraced this kind of Life (as mean as it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
now). Some of the Old <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were
plain honest Grasiers, and the richest of them (as
<hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi>) were busied in looking
to their Grounds and their Flocks. <hi>Moses</hi> the
Great Law-giver was a Shepherd. <hi>Nabal</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sdlom</hi>
were Sheep-masters. <hi>Elisah,</hi> when he was
busy at the Psough with twelve Yoke of Oxen
was call'd thence to the Prophetick Dignity and
office: and <hi>Amos</hi> of a Herdsman became a Divine
Messenger and Preacher. <hi>Shamgar</hi> was taken from
the Herd to be a Judg in <hi>Israet,</hi> and with the same
Goad that he drove his Oxen slew six hundred Men.
<hi>Gideon</hi>'s Seat of State and Justice was a Threshing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floor,
and he had no other Mace than a Flail,
<hi>Iudg.</hi> 6. 14. The renowned <hi>Iair</hi> and <hi>Iephthah</hi> kept
Sheep, and were fetch'd from that Employment
to be Judges. <hi>David</hi> the Son of <hi>Iesse,</hi> a Worthy
Parent in <hi>Israel,</hi> was <hi>took from the Sheep-folds, from

he is call'd elsewhere <hi>Azariah,</hi> for I have shewed
in another Place that it was common with the Jews
to have two Names) was <hi>a Lover of Husbandry,
2 Chron.</hi> 26. 10. And one of the Greatest Kings

for so it is according to the Hebrew. It is worthy
of his Royal Care and Study to support Tillage
and Husbandry, which were heretofore the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of those of the highest Rank.</p>
                     <p>And thus it was also among the Profane Nations
of old. Knowledg and Skill in Rustick Affairs
ushered in Rule and Command. The <hi>Gordian</hi>

thing we are assured of from the Word of Truth,
the Infallible Records of the Bible, which tell us
that these were the Early Business and Practice of
the Greatest and the Best Men. The Greatest
Princes heretofore were esteemed according to the
Numbers of their Cattel.</p>
                     <p>Among the First and Necessary Employments and
Advantages of humane Life may be justly reckon'd
<hi>the Preparing of Food;</hi> and the Scriptures alone can
furnish us with the certain Knowledg of this. It
is undeniable from those plain and express Words
in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 29. that there was no Food allow'd at
first to Mankind but Plants and Herbs, Corn and
all other Fruits of the Earth. I have wondred
sometimes that any who believe the Sacred Text
can question this, for the Words are positive and
downright, utterly excluding all other kind of
Sustenance but this. Yea, unless you can prove
that <hi>Milk</hi> is no part of any Living Creature, but is
a Fruit of the Earth, you have reason to think that
they were debarr'd of this also. But after the
Flood, which had much impaired the Virtue of the
Earth, and exhausted somewhat of its Seminal
Power, there was a Licence to eat Flesh; <hi>Every
moving thing that liveth shall be Meat for you,</hi> Gen.
9. 3. in which is included the Product of Flesh;
<hi>Milk;</hi> which was denied to the <hi>Antediluvians.</hi> But
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46315:519"/>
now all are at liberty to feed on it; and that was
not all, they were so skilful as to make it afford
them <hi>Cheese</hi> and <hi>Butter;</hi> neither of which we read
of before the Deluge. And questionless they that
fed not on Milk knew not the Use of these; but
among the <hi>Post-diluvians Charitze hachalab,</hi> 1 Sam.
17. 18. <hi>Cheeses of Milk</hi> were a common Food:
which are, without doubt, meant by <hi>Shephoth bakar,
2</hi> Sam. 17. 29. <hi>Coagulationes bovis,</hi> as <hi>Pagnine</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
it, <hi>Cheeses of the Milk of Cows,</hi> according to
the Targum: and they are called by the Hebrews,
in their peculiar way of speaking, <hi>the Sons of Milk.</hi>
And in <hi>Iob 10. 10. gebinah</hi> is the Word for <hi>Cheese.</hi>
The other Product of their Milk, as well as of their
Housewifery, was <hi>Chemeah, Butter,</hi> Gen. 18. 7.
Deut. 32. 14. Judg. 5. 25. which was not known
to some other Nations a long time. Among the
<hi>Greeks</hi> there was no such thing, and no Word for
it. <hi>Homer</hi> and the Antient Writers mention <hi>Milk</hi>
and <hi>Cheese,</hi> but of <hi>this</hi> nothing is said. Neither
doth <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>History of Animals</hi> so much as
name it, though he mentions those two forts of
Food, and would certainly have made mention of
this if there had been any such thing among them.
Nor was it made use of among the <hi>Romans,</hi> as we
understand from <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Words<note n="1" place="bottom">Nat. Hist. l. 28. c. 9.</note>, <hi>è lacte fit buty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
barbararum gentium laudatissimus cibus.</hi> The
<hi>Barbarous</hi> are not <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latins,</hi> but the <hi>Oriental</hi>
People; and accordingly the antient Use of this
among the Easterns we learn only from <hi>Moses</hi> and
such Inspired Writers. As to the antient feeding
on the <hi>Flesh of Animals, Abraham</hi>'s entertaining his
Guests with a <hi>Calf,</hi> Gen. 18. 7. (<hi>i. e.</hi> part of a
Calf, a Joint of Veal; for it is not likely that he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:46315:520"/>
set a whole boil'd or rosted, or otherwise dress'd
Calf before three Men, for <hi>Sarah</hi> was in her Tent,
and <hi>Abraham</hi> sat not down with these Guests, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did eat, as may be gathered from those
Words, <hi>He stood by them, and they did eat</hi>) and
many other Instances of making Repasts on other
sorts of Creatures, as Kids, Sheep, Oxen, might
be produced out of this Sacred History.</p>
                     <p>But it appears that there was but little <hi>Art</hi> and
<hi>Cookery</hi> used at first in dressing of Meat. There
was no great Distinction in preparing it, as we
may gather from the Hebrew Word <hi>Aphab,</hi> which
signifies to <hi>boil,</hi> to <hi>bake,</hi> to <hi>fry;</hi> and so <hi>Bashal</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disserently
denotes <hi>Rosting</hi> and <hi>Boiling:</hi> But the
particular Denotation of these Words in the Texts
where they occur, is known only from the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Matter spoken of there. Concerning the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Lamb</hi> there is a strict Injunction not to <hi>boil,</hi> but
<hi>rost</hi> it, <hi>Exod. 12. 8. Deut.</hi> 16. 7. which hath a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
and my sterious Meaning in it, it is likely; but
concerning Common Eatings and Repasts, I do not
find a Difference observed: yet this latter way of
dressing hath had the Preference generally to the
other. Accordingly it may be observed, that the
Poots for the most part present their Heroes feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on rost, and not on boil'd Meat. All <hi>Homer</hi>'s
Dinners for his Great Captains and Worthies are
of the former sort. And<note n="1" place="bottom">In Virgil. Aen. l. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Servius</hi> (who was no
mean Critick) tells us, that in the Times of the
Heroes they were not fed with Boil'd but Rost.
We cannot but take notice that though at first the
Preparing of Diet was simple and artless, yet at
length it became a kind of Science, and much
Time, Study and Cost, were bestowed upon it.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46315:520"/>
Thence we have many Examples of Extravagant
<hi>Feastings</hi> in this Sacred History, on which several
Critical Remarks might be made, to shew what
Customs were prevalent at eating in those Days.
Cookery was grown to a great Height, and as
great an Esteem: there was <hi>Sar Hatabbachim,
Gen. 39. 1. i. e.</hi> according to the Version of the
Seventy <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the Prince of the Cooks:</hi>
and there were <hi>Tabbachoth, Royal She-Cooks,
1 Sam.</hi> 8. 13. Much more might be said on these
Particulars, but I design'd only a Taste of them,
to invite the Curious to study the Bible, for here
is the Antientest Learning in the World, and that
of all Sorts.</p>
                     <p>But the most Useful and Strengthning, as well as
the most Common Food, was <hi>Bread</hi> made of Corn:
concerning which it may be acceptable to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
to know how in those first Ages it was
beaten out of the Ear, how it was ground into
Meal, and how it was made into Bread: which
can be learnt from these Antient Books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
only. And this I must needs say, if <hi>Varro</hi>
and some other Authors before named be consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and prized by Lovers of Antiquity for what
they have deliver'd concerning Country-Affairs
and Husbandry, surely then much more are these
Holy Writings to be esteem'd seeing they far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
them in Antiquity: for <hi>Varro, Cato, Columella,</hi>
or any others that have written <hi>de re Rustica,</hi>
are Modern Authors in respect of the Sacred Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
First then, as to <hi>Threshing</hi> or beating the
Grains of Corn out of the Ears, it was performed
divers ways; as, 1. By drawing a loaded Cart
with Weels over the Corn backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
so that the Wheels running over it did
forcibly shake out the Grain. Of this is express
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:46315:521"/>
mention in Isa. 28. 27. where we read that <hi>Opban
gnagalah</hi> the <hi>Cart-whell</hi> was trun'd about upon some
sort of Corn. And this in the next Verse is call'd
<hi>Gilgal gnagelah,</hi> which is the same, and therefore
by the Vulgar Latin is rendred both here and in
the former Place <hi>Rota Plaustri.</hi> To this bruising
of their Corn with Loaded Carts, perhaps that
Place, <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 13. refers, (although otherwise
applied by Expositors generally) which may be
rendred thus, <hi>I am pressed under you as a full Cart
presseth the Sheaves,</hi> or <hi>Sheaf</hi> (for it is in the singular
Number.) It sets forth the Manner of <hi>Threshing</hi>
in those Days, which was by pressing the Ears of
Corn with a Heavy Cart, and forcing out the
Grain by bringing the Wheels often over it. 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
antient way of <hi>Threshing</hi> was with a Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Slead or Dray without Wheels, full of Iron
Nails or Teeth on the Side toward the Ground,
and loaded with massy Iron, or some other heavy
Weights at top to make it heavy: and this was
drawn by Oxen over the Corn till the Ears were so
pressed that the Grain flew out. This Instrument
was commonly known (as the Hebr. Masters and
Talmudists report) by the Name of <hi>Morag,</hi> and also
of <hi>Charutz:</hi> and accordingly it hath these Names
given it, in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 22. and <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 27. and
both of them together we meet with in <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 15.
where it is translated by us a <hi>sharp Threshing-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.</hi>
And in the same Place it is <hi>said to have
Teeth,</hi> which plainly refers to the foresaid make
of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that this great wooden Plank was set
at the Bottom with Iron Teeth or Pikes to cut
the Sheaves, and make way for the Grain to come
out. And to these Iron Nails or Teeth refers
<hi>Amos</hi> 1. 4. where this sorst of Country Tackling
is call'd <hi>Threshing-Insturments of Iron.</hi> Upon the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46315:521"/>
whole, it appears that the Instrument wherewith
Husbandmen at this Day break the Clods of Earth
was used heretofore (when they had not attain'd
to any great Skill in these Affairs) in Threshing
the Corn; for by the Description that is given of
it, it was a kind of <hi>Harrow.</hi> 3. They thresh'd
with Oxen, who with their Hoofs (which for that
purpose were generally shod with Iron or Brass)
were wont to beat and tread out the Corn: and
sometimes they brought in a whole Herd of Oxen
to trample upon it. This way of Threshing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
to, when they were forbid <hi>to muzzle the Ox
when he treadeth out the Corn,</hi> Deut. 25. 4. And
this is plainly alluded to in <hi>Hos. 10. 11. Ephraim
is a Heifer that is taught, and loves to tread out the
Corn:</hi> and in <hi>Mic. 4. 12, 13. He shall gather them
as Sheaves into the Floor (viz.</hi> to be thresh'd): <hi>Arise
and thresh—I will make thy Hoofs brass, and
thou shalt beat in pieces, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Another antient
way of Threshing was that which is in use with
us, <hi>viz.</hi> with <hi>Flails.</hi> Some sort of Grain and
Seeds were beaten out with these <hi>Flagella,</hi> (for this
is the Word whence that English one comes) as is
clear from <hi>Isa. 28. 27. The Fitches are beaten out
with a Staff, and the cummin with a Rod.</hi> And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<hi>Bread-Corn</hi> was thus thresh'd, as we may
gather from the <hi>28th</hi> ver. Of this Nature was <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon</hi>
and <hi>Araunah</hi>'s threshing of Wheat, <hi>Iudg. 6.
11. 1 Chron.</hi> 21. 20. for 'tis represented as their
Personal Action, and those general Terms <hi>Chabat</hi>
and <hi>Dash</hi> (the Words in those Places) favour this
Sense: and in the former Text <hi>Threshing</hi> is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by <gap reason="foreign">

Preparation) was a great Food in those Eastern
Countries, as we gather from <hi>Lev. 23. 14. Ruth

the Rabbins and Jewish Expositors, first soked

among us at this Day: (where by the way observe
the Antiquity of <hi>Maulting</hi>) But generally the
Drying and Parching of the Corn were to make it
more capable of being ground.</p>
                     <p>The antient Manner of their <hi>Grinding</hi> it (which
is the next thing I am to consider) was two-fold,
either in <hi>Mortars</hi> or <hi>Mills.</hi> That both these were
made use of, we may satisfy our Selves from <hi>Num.</hi>
11. 8. where you read both of <hi>Rechaim</hi> Mills,
and <hi>Medocah</hi> a Mortar. In this latter they were
wont <hi>pinserc</hi> (for from the Jews this Practice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
to the Romans) to <hi>pound</hi> or <hi>bray</hi> their
Corn: whence <hi>Bakers,</hi> who did this in order to
making their <hi>Bread,</hi> had their Name <hi>Pistores.</hi>
That they used of old to <hi>beat and bruise their Wheat</hi>
in a <hi>Mortar</hi> with a heavy <hi>Pestle,</hi> may be collected
from <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 22. where this hollow Vessel is
call'd <hi>Mactesh.</hi> But <hi>Mills</hi> were chiefly made use
of for this purpose in those early Times: and they
were of such use and necessity, that Men were
strictly forbid <hi>to take the nether or the upper Milstone
to pledg, because</hi> (as 'tis added) <hi>this is taking
a Man's Life</hi> (Hebr. <hi>his Soul) to pledg,</hi> Deut. 24.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:46315:522"/>
6. as much as to say, hereby his Neighbour's
Life would be endangered, this is the way to
starve him. The grinding at mills was counted
an inferior sort of Work, and therefore <hi>Prisoners</hi>
and <hi>Captives</hi> were generally set to it: whence <hi>to
take the Milstones, and grind Meal,</hi> is part of the
Description of a <hi>Slave,</hi> Isa. 47. 2. And to this
refers <hi>Samson's grinding in the Prison-House,</hi> Judg.
16. 21. For of old Time there were Mills in their
Prisons, (whence <hi>Pistrinum</hi> is used both for a <hi>Mill</hi>
and a <hi>Prison</hi>) and the Prisoners were wont by
Grinding to earn their Living, and procure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Food. However, this was counted a very
Laborious and Slavish Employment. And this
was in use not only among the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Philistines</hi>
but the <hi>Egyptians</hi> also, and thence there is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Maid-Servant behind the Mill,</hi> i. e. thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it forward with her Arm, Exod. 11. 5. So
among the Chaldeans the <hi>Young Men</hi> (viz. the
Captives of <hi>Iudea) were taken by them to grind,
Lam.</hi> 5. 13. But for the most part the <hi>Women-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
were employed in this Drudgery, as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
from <hi>Mat. 24. 41. Women</hi> are said to
be <hi>grinding at the Mill,</hi> whiles the <hi>Men are in the
Field,</hi> i. e. at work abroad, as we read in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Verse. Therefore<note n="1" place="bottom">Lex. Chald. p. 586.</note> 
                        <hi>Buxtorf</hi> observes that
the Word for <hi>Grinders</hi> is <hi>Resoshoth,</hi> of the Feminine
Gender, to note that Grinding was usually Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's
Work. These <hi>Mills</hi> which they used in
those Days were <hi>Querns</hi> or <hi>Hand-mills,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
before the Invention of others that go with
greater Force, they first dried the Corn (as I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
before) that they might grind with more
Ease.</p>

                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:46315:523"/>
The Corn being thus prepared and reduced to
Meal or Flour, they moistned it, and made it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Dough</hi> or <hi>Paste (Batzek,</hi> Exod. 12. 34. 39. <hi>Gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visah,</hi>
Numb. 15. 20.) and then <hi>baked</hi> it, and
made <hi>Bread</hi> of it. This was either <hi>Cakes,</hi> or
<hi>Loaves:</hi> the lighter kind of Bread was composed
into <hi>Cakes,</hi> Gnuggoth, <hi>Gen. 18. 6. Exod. 12. 39.
Numb. 11. 8. Ezek.</hi> 4. 12. Sometimes <hi>Magnog</hi> is
the Word, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 12. at other Times <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,
Lev. 2. 4. &amp; 24. 5. 2 Sam.</hi> 6. 19. The greater
and heavier sort of Bread was <hi>Loaves:</hi> thence
you read of <hi>Cicear Lechem, a Loaf of Bread,</hi> Exod.
29. 23. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. 3. (tho in some other Places
we render it <hi>a Piece of Bread,</hi> Prov. 6. 26. <hi>Ier.</hi>
37. 21. which shews that the word <hi>Ciccar</hi> is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.)
But this we may depend upon, that <hi>Lechem
Breads</hi> (in the Plural, for it is taken plurally in
1 <hi>Sam. 21. 3. 2 Sam.</hi> 16. 1. and in other Places)
always signifies <hi>Loaves of Bread,</hi> in contradistinction
to <hi>Cakes</hi> or lesser Portions of Bread. Then as to
the antient Manner of <hi>Baking,</hi> it was, 1. <hi>Upon
the Hearth,</hi> under the hot Embers, and thence
<hi>Gnuggoth</hi> are denominated. The first Instance in
the World of this way of Baking, is that in <hi>Gen.</hi>
18. 6. where <hi>Gnuggoth</hi> are by all acknowledg'd to
be <hi>Panes sutcineritii,</hi> and accordingly we render
them <hi>Cakes upon the Hearth,</hi> i. e. such as were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
upon the hot Hearth, and cover'd over with
Ashes. This was the antient way of Baking among
all the Eastern People: and it is in use among them
at this Day. A late<note n="1" place="bottom">Thevenot. Lib. 2. C. 32.</note> Traveller assures us, that
this sort of Bread is ordinarily used among the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Arabians: and he particularly and distinctly
describes their making and ordering of these Cakes.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:46315:523"/>
2. <hi>Upon burning Coles,</hi> something ('tis likely) like
a Grate being laid between, 1 <hi>Kings 19. 6. Isa.</hi>
44. 19. These were the two ways of Baking their
<hi>Cakes,</hi> i. e. their lesser and siner Bread, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were sufficiently baked on one side were
turn'd on the other: whence is that Comparison
of <hi>a Cake not turned,</hi> Hos. 7. 3. They had <hi>Ovens,</hi>
which were first used for Baking the <hi>Holy Bread,
Lev. 2. 4. &amp;</hi> 26. 26. but afterwards for that

Bread. But (to conclude) we are not to think
that <hi>Loaves of Bread,</hi> such as we have of a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

be cut with a Knife, were in use among the <hi>Iews</hi>

before the Flood, yet we may rationally gather
so much, because this simple Element was most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to their simple and plain sort of <hi>Feeding,</hi>
which is in direct Terms express'd. And that
this was the general Beverage after the Flood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,

we know that another Liquor (which was denied

God having granted an Indulgence to eat Flesh,
<hi>Noah</hi> took it for a sufficient Intimation that they
might change their Drink sometimes: wherefore

from the goodness of <hi>Grdpes</hi> the virtue
and benefit of <hi>Wine,</hi> (for even before the Flood
they did eat Grapes, as all other Fruits of the

sometime before the Deluge knew this Liquor,
and abused themselves with it, for 'tis said <hi>they

<hi>Noah</hi> I say, understanding the benefit of Wine,

chose this as a proper Soil for them; for <hi>Armenid</hi>

Vines of that Place are celebrated by Historians.

Vines only: this is properly <hi>Kerem, Vine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in order to make <hi>Wine</hi> of the Fruit of them.
Thus he was <hi>the First that planted a Vineyard:</hi> the
skilful ordering of that generous Fruit to this
particular End, was first found out by him. And
now when the Good Old Man had taken this Pains,
and we may suppose was very weary and thirsty,
he began to taste the Fruit of his Labours, which
happen'd to be with ill Success: for he had chosen
so excellent a Spot of Ground, and had so richly

too rashly made an Experiment of, and with some

Wine, so 'tis not improbable that he admonish'd

of the World, I will proceed further on this
Subject, and from the same unquestionable Records
give some Account of the <hi>Posture</hi> which they used
in Eating and Drinking. We may here inform
our selves that at first they <hi>sat</hi> at Meat, <hi>i. e.</hi> they
either spread something on the Ground, and sat
upon it, or they sat at a Table. Whatever some
Criticks have suggested concerning the Antiquity
of another Position of Body, it is certain that this
was the Antientest of all: for in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there are Examples of this, long before any
of those that are alledged out of Profane Authors.
The Old Hebrew Patriarchs sat at Meat, as is plain
from <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Words to his Father, <hi>Sit and eat of my
Venison,</hi> Gen. 27. 19. There are no Writers in
the World that go so far back as this. And the
next to this is <hi>Gen. 37. 25. They sat down to eat
Bread.</hi> On which Words <hi>Drusius</hi> observes that the
Old Hebrews sat at Meat. That this was the oldest
Posture among the Jews, these Texts sufficiently
testify; <hi>The People sat down to eat and drink,</hi> Exod.
32. 6. and the Apostle, according to the LXX,
renders it so, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. They sat
down, and did eat and drink both of them together,</hi> Judg.
19. 6. <hi>I should not fail to sit down with the King at
Meat,</hi> said <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Ionathan,</hi> 1 Sam. 20. 5. And
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:46315:526"/>
in <hi>ver.</hi> 24. it is expresly said, <hi>The King sat him
down to Meat.</hi> And here by the way we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that there was a certain <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Precedency</hi>

Others as vainly infer from the strict

Command laid upon the Israelites to have<note n="2" place="bottom">Exod. 12. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>their

they used to have them off at other times when

12.</hi> 11. And therefore we cannot conclude from
their eating the Passover with their Shoes on,
that either they were bare-footed at other times
when they dined or supped, or that they lay
down upon Beds. Besides, at other times gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
within Doors, and therefore at their Meals,
they used to wear <hi>Sandals</hi> or <hi>Slippers,</hi> a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to which they are now upon this solemn Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
enjoin'd to have <hi>Shoes</hi> on, as much as to
say, to be ready and prepared for their Journy.
Or lastly, if I should say that it was the custom to
put off their Shoes at Meals even when the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of <hi>Sitting</hi> prevail'd, it were no hard Matter
to prove it; for they washed their Feet even at that
time, as appears from the Relation concerning
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s entertaining the Angels, so that they
must put off their Shoes for that, and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
they put them not on again till they went
out. Wherefore from their putting off their
Shoes it doth not follow that <hi>Discumbiture</hi> was
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46315:527"/>
the Posture in those Days among the Jews, as some
would perswade us.</p>
                     <p>Then, as for <hi>Other Nations,</hi> the same Records
assure us that they <hi>sat at Eating:</hi> thus according
to the use of the Egyptians, <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Brethren
were order'd <hi>to sit according to their Age,</hi> Gen. 43.

And that this was the Posture of eating not only
among the Jews and Egyptians, but the Assyrians
and Chaldeans, may be proved from that one single
Text, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 41. where the Prophet speaking

This without doubt was the first, and most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd

the most Heroick Ages of the World they sat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
when they were at Meals.</p>
                     <p>But afterwards this Posture was changed, for
when Men gave themselves to ease and delicacy,
and grew soft and effeminate, they <hi>lay down</hi> upon
Beds at their Dinners and Suppers, and thence
the Eating-Bed was call'd<note n="3" place="bottom">Plin. Nat. Hist. l. 33. c. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Discubitorius Lectus.</hi>
Lying upon their left Sides, they upheld and rested
the upper Part of their Bodies with their left El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows
(under which was wont to be a Cushion.)
It is supposed they might <hi>sometimes</hi> (perhaps when
they drank more freely) sit up a little, but for the
most part they were in this <hi>leaning lolling</hi> Posture.
This became a general Custom among the Greeks
and Romans, as Authors relate: but the first Rise
of it was from the <hi>Eastern</hi> People, and this we
have first discover'd to us from the Holy Scripture,
which mentions <hi>Ahasuerus</hi>'s <hi>Supper,</hi> and the <hi>Rich and
Gaudy Beds</hi> used on that Occasion, <hi>Esther</hi> 1. 6. That
the Persians lay on Beds at their Banquets, may be

to the <hi>Iews.</hi> Those among them that were Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Feeders lay along, with their Bodies stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out at their Feasts. This seems to be intended
in <hi>Amos 2. 8. they lay themselves down upon Clothes,</hi>

'tis said of them, <hi>Ch. 6. v. 8. they lie upon Beds

                     <p>And if we would know what was the <hi>Particular
Manner</hi> of placing themselves in those Days at
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46315:528"/>
their Mensal Beds, this may be learn'd from seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Passages in Scripture, as well (though not so
largely) as from the Greek and Roman Writers:
nay, here are Antienter Instances of that way of
disposing their Guests than in any other Authors
whatsoever. A Room was generally spread with
Three Beds, (therefore by the Romans call'd <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinium)</hi>
one of which was situated at one end of
the Table, the other two at both Sides: and as
for the other part or the end of the Table, it was
left clear for the Waiters to serve up the Dishes.
Generally three or four lay upon a Bed together:
but this is to be understood of Men only, not of
both Sexes. For it was not usual for the Women
and Men to eat promiscuously at one Table on one
Bed, because the Posture was not fit and decent
for the former. These therefore usually had a
<hi>Triclinium</hi> by themselves, and feasted apart: thus
<hi>Ahasuerus</hi> feasted the Men, and <hi>Vashti</hi> the Women,
<hi>Esther</hi> 1. 3, 9. So the Daughter of <hi>Herodias</hi>
went to her Mother in another Room, feasting
at the same time at another Table, <hi>Matth. 14. 2,
8.</hi> for she stept thither to take her Mother's Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and then <hi>came in straightway unto the King,
Mark</hi> 6. 25. So it was with the <hi>Greeks</hi> generally,
the Women did not dine and sup together with
the Men. But it was otherwise with the <hi>Romans:</hi>
yet this distinction at first was observ'd by them,
that<note n="1" place="bottom">Foeminae cum viris cubantibus sedentes coenitabant. Val. Max. l. 2. c. 1.</note> the Men lay along at Meals, the Women
sat: but afterwards in the degeneracy of Times,
the same Posture was used by both Sexes.</p>
                     <p>Again, we find that this Discumbiture (as well
as the other Posture before spoken of) was not in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46315:529"/>
a disorderly manner, but every one had his Place
according to his Dignity. <hi>When thou art bidden of

                        </gap>, (for 'tis in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Number, though we render it as if it were
plural) the <hi>dining Bed,</hi> which they knew was usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
preferred before the rest, and the chief and
most honourable Situation in that Bed, they also
affected. The Order of placing was this; the
Chief Guest did lie at the Head of the First Bed,
with his Feet behind the back of him that lay next
to him: so the second Man's Head rested in the
first's Bosom, and his Feet were behind the Back
of the third. To this Antient Way of lying along
at Eating, those Words in <hi>Cant. 2. 6. His left Hand
is under my Head, and his right Hand doth imbrace me,</hi>
seem to refer (for this is supposed at a <hi>Feast,</hi> a
<hi>Country-Banquet</hi> in a Garden or Orchard, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 5.
which was the antient Usage; and thence we
<note n="2" place="bottom">Cic. Offic. l. 3.</note> read that <hi>Canius</hi> a Roman Knight bought a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of <hi>Pythias,</hi> in order to invite his Friends, and
feast them there). The Person, according to the
Situation before named, might, if he pleased, lay
his left Hand under the Head of him that lay next
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46315:529"/>
to him, and was in his Bosom; and he lay also
conveniently to imbrace him with his other Hand
or Arm. Thus 'tis said, <hi>the Disciple whom Iesus
loved leaned on his Bosom,</hi> John 13. 23. And again,
ver. 25. <hi>He lay on Iesus's Breast,</hi> which is a plain
Proof of this Order of lying at their Suppers at
that time. Our Saviour had the first and chiefest
Place, <hi>Iohn</hi> who was dearest to him lay next to
him, and lean'd his Head in Christ's Bosom. For
this was the Custom of those times, their Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
and Friends, and such as they loved most,
were placed just below them, so that they could
rest their Heads on their Breasts. That this was a
Sign of Familiarity, Love and Respect, is evident
from that of <hi>Pliny</hi> the Younger,<note n="3" place="bottom">Epist. ad Sophr. lib. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Coenabat Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

<q>—Gremio jacuit nova nupta mariti.</q>
And those of either Sex that were intimate and

the Manner of our Saviour's lying at Supper with
his Apostles, who with him were thirteen in all.
Three Beds being placed about the three Sides of
the Table, there were four Persons in one, four
in another, and five in a third; or else two Beds
held five apiece, and one of them only three, who
it is likely were our Saviour, St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> and St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi>
for as next to <hi>Iohn</hi> he intimates that he should
ask of Christ who was to be the Traitor. This
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46315:530"/>
Bed whereon our Blessed Master and these two
Apostles lay was the Middle Bed, <hi>viz.</hi> that which
was set at the End of the Table; but in respect of
the Beds which were placed on the two Sides was
the Middle one; for this was reckon'd as the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost
and most honourable. Christ lay at th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Head or upper End of this Bed, for this was the

                        </gap>, the Chief Place of Recumbency, and
was always reserv'd for the Worthiest Persons;
though I confess there was some Variation as to this
among the <hi>Romans,</hi> (and so might be among the
Jews their Imitators) among whom the other End
of the Middle Bed was sometimes the uppermost
and most valued. Moreover, we may gather from
<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 23. that the Table about which the Beds
were placed was square and short, so that all of
them could eat out of the same Dish. <hi>He that dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
his Hand with me in the Dish, the same shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
me,</hi> Mat. 26. 23. In which Words our Saviour
points not at one particular Person, for all dipp'd
their Hands in the Dish, they did eat all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
for their Beds were close to the Table, and
the Table was not broad, so that they could all
conveniently reach to the Vessels in which the Meat
was. They could all <hi>put</hi> (that is the Meaning of
<hi>Dipping</hi>) their Hands into the same Dish; and
among these that did so at this time, there was one
that designed to betray our Blessed Lord.</p>
                     <p>But though this was the Usage then, yet I must
adjoin this, that at the Entertainment of some Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Guests, and to shew a more than ordinary
Kindness to them, there was another Custom anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
in use, that is, every one had his Portion
apart at the Table. <hi>Homer</hi> makes all his Heroes
eat after this fashion; particularly he tells us, that
<hi>Ajax</hi>'s Allotment (who 'tis likely was as good at
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46315:530"/>
eating as fighting) was<note n="7" place="bottom">—<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>a Chine of Beef;</hi> for the
more worthy and honourable the Guest was, the
greater was his Allowance. But the Sacred Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
gives us the earliest Examples of this kind, as
indeed it doth of all other sorts of Usages. Here
we read that <hi>Ioseph,</hi> when he entertained his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>took and sent Messes</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> according to
the LXX, <hi>particular Portions) unto them from before
him,</hi> Gen. 43. 34. If it be said that <hi>the Egyptians
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ight not eat Bread with the Hebrews, for that was an
Abomination to the Egyptians,</hi> ver. 32. and that was
the Reason why they had particular Parts or Messes
allotted them, and therefore it doth not follow
thence that this was a Custom either among the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> or <hi>Egyptians</hi> when they feasted asunder;
I answer, the true Reason why the Hebrews and
Egyptians did not sit and eat together at the same
Table, was because the one eat Flesh, and the other
did not, and on that Account their Different
Customs were <hi>abominable</hi> to one another. But the
dividing of the Meat, and distributing a Particular
Portion to every one, had no reference at all to
this, but was a General Custom in those times, and
was (I conceive) partly founded upon this, that
hereby they had no Opportunity of shewing their
particular Respects to the Guests according to their
different Quality; for the greatest and choicest
Portion of Viands was allotted to those whose Place
and Dignity required more than ordinary Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
or for whom they had the greatest Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Love. Thus in the Relation here given
us, <hi>Benjamin</hi>'s <hi>Mess was five times so much as any of
his Brethren.</hi> This was a Mark of singular Favour
and Affection, for <hi>Ioseph</hi> was more nearly related
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:46315:531"/>
to <hi>Benjamin</hi> than to any of the rest, who indeed
were but his half-Brethren; but <hi>Benjamin</hi> was his
Brother both by the Father's and the Mother's
side. Hence it may be gather'd that this Practice
was not grounded on the Difference of Meats on
which the Hebrews and Egyptians fed. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
from other Instances in this Divine Book it
appears, that though Persons sat at the same Table,
and differ'd not about the sort of Food, yet they
had particular Messes or Portions distributed to
them. So when <hi>Elkanah</hi> and his Family and Friends
feasted together on a solemn Occasion, to shew his
more especial Love and Regard to <hi>Hannah, he gave
to her a worthy Portion, 1 Sam. 1. 5. Manah aphajim</hi>
(where <hi>aphajim</hi> is the same with <hi>panim,</hi> as is usual
in the Holy Stile) <hi>a Distribution of Faces,</hi> such a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
share of Meat as shew'd a favourable Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
a particular Respect and Love; such a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as was usually given to the best and most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
sort of Guests. Another Remarkable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of this we have in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 23, 24. where
we read that <hi>Samuel</hi> invited <hi>Saul</hi> to a Feast, and
<hi>made him sit in the chiefest Place among them that
were bidden,</hi> (for there was a Precedency in those
times according to the Rank of the Persons that
were invited) <hi>and he said unto the Cook,</hi> (whom he
had spoken to before to prepare this Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
<hi>Bring the Portion which I gave thee, of which
I said unto thee, Set it by thee:</hi> (which I ordered
thee to have in Readiness against the time that I
call'd for it) <hi>And the Cook took up the Shoulder,</hi>(for
that was the peculiar Joint of Meat which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd
for his Portion; and indeed it appears from
being the <hi>Priest</hi>'s particular Portion, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 32.
that it was accounted the choicest part) <hi>and that
which was upon it,</hi> (it may be some lesser and dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46315:531"/>
Morsels which were serv'd up in the same Dish)
<hi>and set it before</hi> Saul. Whence it is evident that in
old times they had a certain Measure and Quantity
of Meat appointed them at Feasts by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Master of it. This is <hi>the appointed Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
rendred by our Translators <hi>necessary Food,
Iob</hi> 23. 12. and this is <hi>the Food of Allowance or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,</hi>

attending to the Sense rather than the
Original Word. The set Portions of Meat were

Likewise here we are acquainted that <hi>Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off the Shoes,</hi> and <hi>Washing the Feet,</hi> were an
usual Attendant at Eating and Feasting; and the
one was in order to the other. I grant that the
Antients wore not Shoes at all times, yea their
Captives and Slaves went always bare-foot, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

evident from <hi>Isa.</hi> 20. 4. Nay, some of the better
sort of People among the Gentiles were put upon
this Hardship by their severe Governours and Law-givers: so <hi>Lycurgus</hi> enjoined the Spartans to go
without Shoes. But among the <hi>Iews</hi> I find no
such thing; even in the Wilderness (where they
underwent the greatest Difficulties) their Feet were

Decay a long time. And from <hi>Exod. 3. 5. Iosh. 5.
15. Deut.</hi> 25. 9. and several other Places, it may
be proved that their Feet were armed with this
Defence; yea, it was an Ornament as well as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and is reckon'd as such in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 10.
where we find that <hi>Shoes</hi> of the best and most
fashionable sort were made of <hi>Badgers Skins,</hi> viz.
dress'd and made into Leather. Now, when they
came into a House as Guests to be entertain'd,
they stripp'd themselves of this lower Apparel,
and had their Feet wash'd and cleans'd; and this
was the usual Introduction to their sitting or lying
down to eat. A very antient Instance of this you
have in <hi>Iudg. 19. 21. They washed their Feet, and did
eat and drink.</hi> And that this was afterwards a
<hi>Iewish</hi> Custom is clear from our Saviour's upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Simon</hi> in those Words, <hi>I enter'd into thy House,
but thou gavest me no Water for my Feet,</hi> Luke 7. 44.
which he would not have said if the Washing the
Feet had not been a common Testimony of Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Friendly Entertainment. From<note n="1" place="bottom">Lib. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Athenaeus</hi>
we learn that the <hi>Greeks</hi> used this Custom at their
Feasts; and many Authors attest the same concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Romans.</hi> And as to the Discalceation in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                        <hi>Terence,</hi> and several other
Writers speak of it.</p>
                     <p>Besides, the Sacred Writings inform us, that
<hi>Anointing</hi> was of old an usual Entertainment at their
Feasts. Thus the Penitent <hi>Magdalen</hi> bestow'd a
Box of Spikenard on Christ's<note n="4" place="bottom">Luke 7. 38. John 12. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Feet</hi> while he was at
Supper: and indeed, according to the Account
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:46315:533"/>
before given of his Situation at that time, she had
the Advantage to do it, his Feet being towards
her, and bare; for (as was just now said) they
put off their Shoes and lay barefoot on their
Eating-Beds. At another time this Religious
Woman refresh'd and perfumed his <hi>Head</hi> with
precious Ointment when he was at the Table,
<hi>Mat. 26. 7. Mark</hi> 14. 3. And it is particularly
recorded that this fragrant Ointment was in an
<hi>Alabaster-Box:</hi> which is according to what <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus,
Athenaeus, Plutarch</hi> and other antient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
relate, (whom you may see alledg'd in Dr.
<hi>Hammond</hi>'s Annotations on <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 7.) that
those particular Vessels, <hi>viz. Alabaster-Boxes,</hi>
were commonly made use of for that purpose. It
is said in the foremention'd Place in St. <hi>Mark</hi>
that <hi>she brake the Box of Spikenard,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
signifies to <hi>shake</hi> or <hi>knock,</hi> rather than to <hi>break;</hi>
so that the meaning is this, she shook the Box, or
knock'd it against the Ground to make the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
come forth the better. This pouring of
Odoriferous Oils on the Heads of their Guests at
Feasts, is taken notice of in <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 5. where
with <hi>preparing a Table</hi> is join'd <hi>anointing the Head
with Oil.</hi> And in <hi>Eccl. 9. 8, 9. Eat thy Bread
with joy, and drink thy Wine with a merry Heart;
and let thy Head lack no Ointment.</hi> And because it
was used at these times of Mirth and Rejoicing,
'tis call'd <hi>the Oil of Ioy,</hi> Isa. 61. 3. Of this it is
probable, the Parable in <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. speaks, where
among the <hi>Steward</hi>'s Expences <hi>a hundred Measures of
Oil</hi> are reckon'd, which were used at Festivals.
With the Holy Scriptures accord the Pagan Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who frequently make mention of this fragrant
Unction. That it was used among the Greeks is

and therefore I remit the Reader thither.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, here is mention'd another remarkable

order the Guests at the Feast, and to give Laws
concerning the eating and drinking. And generally
this <hi>Symposiarch,</hi> this Overseer and Controller of
the Feast, was a Friend and Associate of the
Person that made the Feast, and was acquainted
with the Guests. Thus I have briefly from this

comprehensive, and then here may be signified to
us the general Skill of Improving all Metals for
the Needs of Mankind. It is not improbable that
the <hi>Art of Refining</hi> was found out by this <hi>Tubal-Cain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
and that he taught Men the separation of Metal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
from their Dross. However that this Separating
and Purifying them, to render them more useful
were very Antient, is plain from <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. 6. which
mentions <hi>Silver tried in a Furnace of Earth, purified
seven times:</hi> And we read, <hi>Mal. 3. 2. of a Refiner
Fire.</hi> But this we are <hi>certainly</hi> informed of from
the forenamed Text in <hi>Genesis,</hi> that <hi>Tubal-Cain</hi>
was more especially skill'd in the use of those
Metals there mention'd, <hi>viz. Brass</hi> and <hi>Iron:</hi> he
knew the particular and proper Use of them in
all <hi>Trades</hi> and <hi>Employments</hi> that require them, as
in that of a <hi>Carpenter,</hi> a <hi>Mason,</hi> &amp;c. and most
of the Laborious and Handicraft Trades.</p>
                     <p>With <hi>Mechanicks</hi> and <hi>Manual Arts</hi> we may join
<hi>Architecture,</hi> which cannot be managed without
<hi>Tools</hi> of either of these Metals. Where again we
may observe the rash and groundless Assertion of
the foresaid Writer, <hi>viz. that there were not of old
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46315:534"/>
any Instruments belonging to Building.</hi> This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
from what hath been said concerning <hi>Metals,</hi>
for of these they could make Instruments that were
serviceable in Building. Therefore when the
Egyptians held that <hi>Vulcan</hi> was the Inventer of
Architecture, it is probable they had reference to
<hi>Tubal-Cain,</hi> (the first Founder of Metals which
were so useful in Building) who was the Heathen
<hi>Vulcan,</hi> as all Mythologists acknowledg. It is true,
This, as all other Arts, was mean and low at first,
for it began with <hi>making and fixing up of Tents</hi>
(which I spake of before.) The <hi>Father,</hi> i. e. the
Inventer of which was <hi>Iabal,</hi> who it is probable
made them of <hi>Skins</hi> or <hi>Hides</hi> of Beasts; for our
First Parents, and without doubt all others in
imitation of them, were <hi>clothed with Skins</hi> (of which
afterwards) which they found kept out Rain
and Cold; and accordingly they learn'd to clothe
their <hi>Tabernacles</hi> with the same Materials, and for
the same End and Purpose: and to confirm this,
we read in several Places afterwards that the <hi>Tents</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r <hi>Booths</hi> were made of Skins; in tacking and
fastning of which it is likely they at length made
use of some of <hi>Tubal</hi>'s Hard Ware. This was the
first Essay of <hi>Building,</hi> these were the first <hi>Houses.</hi>
And from thence a <hi>Tabernacle</hi> and a <hi>House</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible:
thus <hi>Iob</hi> mentions his <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> Ch. 31.
<hi>v.</hi> 31. not that he had not a <hi>House</hi> properly so
call'd, he being <hi>the Greatest Man in the East:</hi> and
that he had so, appears further from <hi>Ch. 21. v.</hi> 28.
And his Children had such Houses, else the <hi>fall of
the House,</hi> Chap. 1. v. 19. could not have kill'd
them. But sometimes they retain'd the old Name
of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> which were first in use: therefore
<hi>Iob</hi> calls his House or Palace a <hi>Tabernacle</hi> in the
Place above cited. So in <hi>Iudg. 12. 8. his Tent is</hi>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:46315:535"/>
explain'd by adding <hi>his House:</hi> for as a<note n="1" place="bottom">Drusius.</note> Learned
Critick saith well upon the Place, Because they of
old dwelt in Tents, they afterwards call'd any
House a Tent. And 'tis further observable that
<hi>their Houses</hi> (for so 'tis in the Hebrew, though we
translate it <hi>Housholds) and their Tents,</hi> Deut. 11. 6.
is as much as <hi>their Houses, namely their Tents:</hi> for
in the Desart they had only <hi>Tents</hi> or <hi>Booths,</hi> which
were instead of Houses. And let me observe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that <hi>Ohel</hi> a <hi>Tabernacle</hi> is rendered <gap reason="foreign">

which confirms what I said before concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Materials of Houses. <hi>Booths</hi> and these
were alike, and thence perhaps arose the literal

the first Builder, for being haunted and torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a guilty Conscience, to divert it he fell
a building: and perhaps he did it to environ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with Walls, to keep himself safe. A City
was made a Sanctuary, a Place of Refuge. And
as <hi>Cain</hi> is recorded to be the First Builder before
the Flood, so <hi>Nimrod</hi> was the first after it; for
the <hi>City and the Tower which he</hi> and his Partisans
<hi>built,</hi> are expresly mention'd <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 5. And if
you would know the chief Materials that these
bold Architects made use of in this Work, the
<hi>3d Verse</hi> will acquaint you, <hi>they had Brick for Stone,
and Slime had they for Mortar.</hi> Which intimates,
that they would have made use of Stone to build
the Tower, (for Stone was ever of greatest Esteem
for that purpose, and the Great Mens Houses were
built of these, 1 <hi>Kings 7. 9, 11. Isa. 9. 10. Am.
5. 11.)</hi> and would have cemented the building with
Mortar, if the Place had afforded either. But
it seems it did not, and therefore they used Brick
instead of Stone, and a Bituminous Substance
which that Soil furnish'd them with instead of
Lime and Sand. Accordingly we are told by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<note n="3" place="bottom">Ovid, Lucan, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal.</note> Pagan Writers that the Walls of <hi>Babylon</hi>

whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>As to the more ordinary way of Building, it is
certain that the general Draught or Scheme of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:46315:537"/>
                        <hi>Erecting of Houses,</hi> as they are represented in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
Sacred Writings, hath been taken for the Model
of these Dwellings in all Countries ever since.
And here I will choose out only one thing to speak
of, because it may give Light to several Passages
in Scripture. It was the Custom in <hi>Palestine</hi> to
build their Houses <hi>flat at top;</hi> and they made a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
much use of <hi>this</hi> as of any part of their Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Here they <hi>walked,</hi> as may be partly gather'd
from <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 8 but it is in express Terms said
in 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2 that <hi>David walked here in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
the time when he saw the fair <hi>Bathsheba.</hi>
Here they <hi>pray'd,</hi> as is evident from <hi>Acts 10. 9.
Peter went up upon the House-top,</hi>(<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which
is the Word in the New Testament, that answers
to <hi>Gag</hi> in the Old) <hi>to pray about the sixth Hour.</hi>
For here the Jews had the Convenience of looking
towards <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which they were commanded
to do whenever they pray'd in a Place distant from
it, <hi>I Kings</hi> 8. 48. and this was St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Case here,
wherefore he <hi>went up</hi> hither to offer his Prayers.
Here they <hi>sacrific'd</hi> sometimes: whence you read
of <hi>burning Incense on the Roofs of Houses,</hi> Jer. 19.
13. &amp; 32. 29. and <hi>worshipping the Host of Heaven
upon the House-tops,</hi> Zeph. 1. 5. This was also the
place of <hi>Publick Mourning and Lamenting,</hi> as is
clearly deducible from <hi>Ier.</hi> 48. 38. And in <hi>Isa.
22. 1 to go up to the House-tops,</hi> is to make an open
Condolance and Lamentation. From these high
and eminent Places they were wont to <hi>discover any
Danger at a Distance;</hi> thence you read of <hi>the
Watchman going up to the Roof,</hi> 2 Sam. 18. 24.
They used to <hi>speak to the People</hi> from these Places
as fittest for that purpose; whence that Proverbial
kind of speaking used by our Saviour, <hi>Mat. 10.
27. to preach on the House-tops,</hi> is to make a thing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:46315:537"/>
known to all, to proclaim it to the World. Here
they <hi>did eat, and drink, and sleep,</hi> especially in the
Summer-Evenings; thus <hi>David rose from off his
Bed,</hi> 2 Sam. 11. 2. (the Bed where he had supped,
and it is probable had taken a short Nap after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards)
and from hence had his unfortunate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect.
Again, this was usually among the Jews
and other Eastern People, a Place of <hi>Employment</hi>
and <hi>Business,</hi> of one kind or other: and therefore,
by <hi>him which is on the House-top,</hi> Mat, 24. 17. is
meant, the Man that is about his Business or Work
at Home, in contradistinction to the Man employ'd
<hi>in the Field,</hi> v. 18. Lastly, from what hath been
suggested, and from the very Nature of the Place,
it must needs be gather'd that it was open and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the Sight of the World, and therefore
<hi>Absalom</hi> purposely made choice of this to defile his
Father's Concubines in, that it might be <hi>in the
Sight of all Israel,</hi> 2 Sam. 16. 22.</p>
                     <p>But then why were the <hi>Spies</hi> that were sent by
<hi>Ioshua</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> lodged here by

<hi>to hide them:</hi> therefore it seems there was upon
this <hi>Roof</hi> some Place that was private; otherwise
she would not have disposed of them here. It
might be answer'd, and that from the Context,
that though it was an open Place, yet she knew
that the green Stalks of Flax which lay there a
drying would sufficiently cover those Persons, and
keep them from being seen, especially in the
Night-season. But I rather think that the Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this good Woman lay in this, that she
carried them up to a Place that was known to be
open and frequented, and therefore it could not be
imagined that she would, or that she could hide
them in the openest Place of her House. Here
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46315:538"/>
was the Subtlety of this Female; she knew that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

could not be the least suspition of their being

                     <p>Further, I might observe, that because Flat-roof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the Africans used the dark Excrementitious Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour

Thus the Foundation of all <hi>Grammar,</hi> and the Root

                     <p>Next unto <hi>Grammar</hi> I might mention <hi>History,</hi>
the first Father of which was <hi>Moses,</hi> whose Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
begin the Bible. All that I will say of him
under this present Character is this, that we are
solely indebted to him for our Knowledg of the
Transactions of the First Ages of the World. As
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46315:547"/>
he wrote before all other Historians, so he gives us
an Account of those things which none besides
doth; wherefore his Books are the Key of all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story.
To him are added Others, who are not
only of admired Antiquity, but ought to be prized
as much for the Admirable and Various Matter
they communicate. Here are Excellent Historical
Passages of all sorts, Religious and Civil, Sacred
and Profane, Foreign and Domestick, relating to
Politicks and Oeconomicks, to Publick and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Affairs. Yea, the<note n="1" place="bottom">Arcana Historiae.</note> Title of <hi>Procopius</hi>'s Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
belongs only and properly to these Sacred Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,
for here the <hi>Secrets</hi> and <hi>Depths</hi> of all An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Occurrences are contain'd, and here are those
Choice Materials which no other Histories furnish
us with. But I should be endless if I should enlarge
here by particularizing; therefore I will not launch
out, but only commend to the Reader the Learned
Endeavours of <hi>Strigelius</hi> in his Commentaries on
the Books of <hi>Samuel, Kings, Chronicles,</hi> where he
will be amply convinc'd of the unparallell'd Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
Multiplicity, and Peculiar Excellency of the
<hi>Historical</hi> Examples in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>The Antientest <hi>Poetry</hi> is in the Old Testament:
for as <hi>Moses</hi> was the first <hi>Historian,</hi> so he is the first
<hi>Poet</hi> that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>xtant. A Proof of this we have in
that <hi>Eucharistick Song</hi> which he composed upon his
passing the Red Sea, and is recorded in <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.
An Admirable Hymn it is, and in Hexameter
Verse, if<note n="2" place="bottom">Antiq. l. 2. c. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus</hi> may be Judg in this Matter,
and if a <hi>Christian Father</hi> may be credited, who had
more Hebrew than most of the Writers of the
Church in his time, yea more than all of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Origen.</hi> But whether this be true or no, this
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46315:547"/>
is without Controversy, that there is no Piece of
<hi>Poetry</hi> in the World that hath the Priority of this
of <hi>Moses:</hi> for <hi>Orpheus,</hi> who is reckon'd by the
Pagans as the First Poet, was, according to the
most favourable Computation of some of their
Historians, three hundred Years after <hi>Moses,</hi> and
<hi>Homer</hi> was towards six hundred. Besides this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Hymn, there are other Antient ones of the
like nature recorded in the same Authentick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
<hi>viz. Deborah</hi>'s Song, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. which hath
many Noble Flights of Poetry; and that of <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah;</hi>
the Mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
hath Excellent Poetick Raptures. And here by the
way I will offer this Conjecture, that perhaps from
<hi>Miriam</hi>'s bearing her part in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Song, (<hi>Exod.</hi>
15<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> 20, 21.) and from these other <hi>Womens</hi> Poetick
Inspiration, which came to be celebrated among
the neighbouring Nations, the Poets (who, as I
have largely shew'd elsewhere, have frequent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
to the Old Testament) took occasion to
report that <hi>Poetry</hi> was of Female Extraction, and
that <hi>Calliope,</hi> one of that Sex, was the Author of
their Faculty. Other famous Instances there are
here of this Sacred Art, as <hi>David</hi>'s Incomparable
<hi>Elegy</hi> on the Death of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathan,</hi> 2 Sam. 1.
16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that <hi>Gratulatory Hymn</hi> in the <hi>12th</hi> Chapter
of <hi>Isaiah; Hezekiah</hi>'s <hi>Song of Praise</hi> in the <hi>38th</hi> of
the same Prophet; <hi>Habakkuk</hi>'s Lofty <hi>Description</hi> of

<hi>chap.</hi> 3. the Stile of which is far more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
and majestick than any of <hi>Orpheus</hi> or <hi>Pindar</hi>'s
Odes. I appeal to any Man of Skill, and that
hath a right <hi>Poetick</hi> Genius, whether this be not
true. And as there are these single Hymns and
Songs, so there are Just Poems, for of the Books
of the Old Testament there are six that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46315:548"/>
and writ in Verse, <hi>viz.</hi> the Books of <hi>Iob,</hi>
the <hi>Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi>
As to the Nature of the Hebrew Poesy,
and the Kinds of Verses which are in the Bible,
the Learned<note n="1" place="bottom">Quaest. in cap. 4. Gen. v. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>Mersennus</hi> and others have given us
some Account of them, but it is very short and
mean, and much of it is mere Surmise, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I will not trouble the Reader with it. A late
Writer hath attempted to prove that the Hebrew
Verse or Poetry of the Old Testament is in <hi>Rhythm;</hi>
which I believe is true in many Places: and if the
Pronuntiation and Sound were the very same now
that they were when these Poetick Books were
composed, we should observe the Cadence in them
more frequently. But he goes too far in asserting
that all the Hebrew Poesy in Scripture is Rhythm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for they were not so exact at first: though the
Verses end with the same Sound sometimes, yet
generally they took a Liberty. Upon Examination
we may find this to be true, and I may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to say something further of it when I come to
speak particularly of the <hi>Psalms.</hi> But the other
Assertion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Psalms and other Pieces of
Hebrew Poetry are <hi>always</hi> Rhythmical, necessarily
infers a great many Faults and Mistakes in the
Scripture, it supposes several Places to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
and mangled, (for we do not find all the
Poetry of the Bible to be such at this day) and
consequently subverts the Truth and Authority of
the Bible, which is by no means to be allowed of.
All that I will add under this Head is, that even
among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the first and antientest Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
were <hi>Poets.</hi>
                        <note n="2" place="bottom">Geogr. l. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Poetry was before Prose, and that this is but an
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46315:548"/>
Imitation of that. It can't be denied that the

that their Laws were all in Metre. Concerning the

is probable, was in Emulation of the First Sacred
Writers, the Penmen of the Old Testament, in
whose Writings there are several things dictated
in Measure, and some entire Books are altogether
Metrical; for it was the Design of the Holy Ghost
to delight as well as profit.</p>
                     <p>With <hi>Poetry</hi> let us join <hi>Musick,</hi> it being of so
near Affinity with it: and the First Inventer of this
also is to be known only from the Scripture;
which informs us, that <hi>Iubal,</hi> the Son of <hi>Lamech</hi>
the sixth from <hi>Adam,</hi> was <hi>the Father of such as han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the Harp and Organ,</hi> Gen. 4. 21. From whose
Name some have thought the <hi>Iubilee</hi> was called,
because it was proclaim'd with <hi>Musick.</hi> The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
tell us, that <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> were the first
Authors of it, by whom it is not improbable they
meant <hi>Moses,</hi> who first gives an Account of the
Original of this Art, and might well be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by <hi>Apollo</hi> because of his Singular Wisdom,
and by <hi>Mercury</hi> because he was the First <hi>Interpreter</hi>
of the Divine Will in his Writings, and on other
Accounts merited that Name, as I have evidenc'd
in another Place. Perhaps the Story of <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras's</hi>

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46315:549"/>
on Musical Instruments. Hence he mentions his
Harp and other Instruments often in his Book of
<hi>Psalms.</hi> And it appears from what we read in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
16. 19. that he was initiated into this Art betimes,
and was very Eminent in it when he was a Young
Man, otherwise he would not have been sent for to

and Candidates, (as we may inform our selves

Musick was a considerable Part of Divine Service.
And there was not only Singing of Psalms, but
playing upon Instruments, of which some were
<note n="1" place="bottom">Psal. 4. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Neginoth,</hi> such as yielded a Sound by touch or

                        <hi>Nechiloth</hi> Wind-Instruments.
This was the pompous Service of the Jewish Church,
this was the Temple-Musick, which began not (as
Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> thinks) till the pouring out of the
<hi>Drink-Offering,</hi> when the <hi>Cup of Salvation</hi> (as the
Psalmist calls it) went about. And here also it
might be observ'd, that the Religious and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Raptures of holy Men were attended with, and
promoted by Musick: thus <hi>a company of Prophets
came down from the high Place</hi> (where they had been
worshipping) <hi>with a psaltery, and a Tabret, and
a Pipe, and Harp before them,</hi> 1 Sam. 10. 5. praising
God with Songs which the Holy Spirit dictated to
them. Thus the famous Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> call'd for
a Minstrel, <hi>and when the Minstrel play'd, the Hand
of the Lord came upon him,</hi> 2 Kings 3. 15. <hi>i. e.</hi> he
was stirr'd up thereby to undertake and accomplish
great things for the Glory of God, of which you
read in the ensuing Verses. It is no wonder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that <hi>Musick</hi> was thought to be <hi>Divine,</hi> that
it was (as <hi>Plato</hi> faith of it) the Invention<note n="3" place="bottom">De Leg. Lib. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:46315:550"/>
for Natives of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and then it is not to be
doubted that the Sacred Use and Improvement of
Musick among the <hi>Iews</hi> was referr'd to by this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher.
Thus Musick was first dedicated to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Divine Worship.</p>
                     <p>But we read that upon other Occasions also it
was made use of, <hi>viz.</hi> at all solemn times of Rejoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.
Hence <hi>Laban</hi> complimented <hi>Iacob</hi> after this
Manner, that if he had known of his Intentions
of going away from him, <hi>he would have sent him
away with Mirth and with Songs, with Tabret and
with Harp,</hi> Gen. 31. 27. It seems this was the
Antient Entertainment at their Farewels. And
the same was used at all great Festivals, <hi>the Harp
and the Viol, the Tabret and Pipe</hi> (as well as <hi>Wine</hi>)

Fight or Drink, hasten to War or Banquets as he
pleas'd. And not only Men, but Brutes have
been capable of this Charm: several wild Beasts

with Musick. Nay we are told by the Poetick

have felt the Force of it: which indeed is Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

and Astonishing Virtue of this Delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Art. Hence it is that the Noblest Minds have

serious Brains have been entertain'd and ravish'd
with its agreeable Pleasures: so <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports of
<hi>Plato;</hi> and concerning <hi>Socrates</hi> we are inform'd by

to Mankind) and <hi>the best Grounds of it</hi> are learnt
from this Divine Volume. Here we are told that
<hi>Natural Philosophy</hi> was founded by <hi>Adam;</hi> for no
less is comprehended in those words, <hi>Gen. 2. 19, 20.
The Lord God brought every Beast of the Field, and
every Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>l of the Air unto</hi> Adam, <hi>to see what he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ould call them: and whatsoever</hi> Adam <hi>call'd every
living Creature, that was the Name thereof. And</hi>
Adam <hi>gave Names to all Cattel, and to the Fowl of
the Air, and to every Beast of the Field.</hi> And 'tis
reasonable to believe that he also gave Names to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46315:552"/>
Plants, Trees, Herbs, and all Celestial and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Creatures. Now, it is not to be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
that their <hi>Names</hi> were bestow'd upon them
according to their particular Nature; for this
Great <hi>Nomenclator</hi> was created perfect by God,
and endued with the Knowledg of all natural and
divine Things, and therefore in fixing certain
Names on them, he thereby signified their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
natural Qualities. And that he really did so,
is manifest from his giving a Name to his Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
Companion; as soon as God brought her to
him, he presently knew her by virtue of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Instinct and Knowledg wherewith he was
created, <hi>and said, This is now Bone of my Bones, and
Flesh of my Flesh: she shall be called Woman, because
she was taken out of Man,</hi> Gen. 2. 23. We see here
that the Name <hi>Ishah</hi> or <hi>Woman</hi> was impos'd accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the nature and condition of the Person: and
can any Man of deliberate Thoughts imagine
that the same was not done in the naming of
the Inferior Creatures? No certainly; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if we take notice of the <hi>like</hi> manner of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
this and the other Imposition of Names: for
as 'tis said here, <hi>God brought the Woman to the Man,
v.</hi> 22. whereupon he gave her her Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
so in the foregoing place it is said, <hi>God brought
the Creatures unto Adam,</hi> viz. in order to their
receiving their Names from him. Nay, this very
thing is particularly express'd in that forecited
Text, which speaks of this Action of <hi>Adam,</hi> (tho
Expositors are not pleas'd to take notice of it)
<hi>God brought them to</hi> Adam, <hi>to see what he would call
them.</hi> Where <hi>to see</hi> refers not to <hi>God</hi> (as general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Interpreters think) but to <hi>Adam.</hi> The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were brought on purpose that he might <hi>see,
i. e.</hi> that he might know by looking on them what
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46315:552"/>
their Nature was, and that accordingly he might
know how to give Names to them. For it is not
reasonable to think that this is spoken of <hi>God,</hi> as
if he himself would <hi>see</hi> or <hi>know,</hi> &amp;c. for this
would argue imperfection in him, and would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
that he knew not at that time what they were
to be called, or at least what <hi>Adam</hi> would call
them. Therefore this Interpretation which I
give of the Words is rather to be embraced than the
other. We are acquainted here with the End and
Purpose for which all Living Things were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd
to appear before <hi>Adam,</hi> viz. that he might
give them Names which denoted their Nature.
Accordingly some of them that we meet with in
Scripture give an Account of the Qualities they
are endued with. And though it is true that some
of them signify only their Outward and Visible
Qualities, yet we are to remember that it was not
easy to discover even These at the <hi>first View</hi> of the
Creatures, and therefore Man's Sagacity was tried
by it. And besides, the Primitive Significations
of many Names (as all the Learned acknowledg)
are lost, and by length of time are forgot; so that
though some of these Words whereby Animals are
express'd, seem not to set forth their Internal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Disposition, yet we cannot thence pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
infer that they did not so at first, yea
that they do not so now, though we do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
it by reason of our being unacquainted
with the Original Derivations of Words. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
then, that the Creatures were brought to
<hi>Adam</hi> to give him an early Opportunity of exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Knowledg and Wisdom in fitly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
the several sorts of Creatures by their
particular Names: and accordingly, <hi>whatever he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>all'd them, that was their Name.</hi> Thus it is clear
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:46315:553"/>
that this <hi>Nomenclatorship</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> is a certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the Insight which he had into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of these Animals: and all the <hi>Iewish Rabbins</hi>
and Commentators on the Place acknowledg as
much. And thence is that Observation of<note n="1" place="bottom">
                           <hi>In</hi> Cratylo.</note> 
                        <hi>Plato,</hi>
that there is something extraordinary and Divine
in the <hi>Antient Names of things:</hi> they arose <hi>from
a more than humane Power,</hi> he saith. It is not to be
doubted then that <hi>Adam</hi> was the <hi>First Philosopher,</hi>
and laid the Foundation of all Philosophick Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Next to him I will mention <hi>Moses,</hi> who (as
I have partly shew'd already, and shall more fully
afterwards, when I present the Reader with a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Comment on the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi>)
was well skill'd in the true Principles of Nature,
and perfectly understood the Right System of the
World. It is said of this Great Man that <hi>he was
learned in all the Wisdom of the Egyptians,</hi> Acts 7. 22.
which comprehends not only <hi>Arithmetick, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry,
Astronomy,</hi> all Parts of <hi>Mathematicks, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks,</hi>
of all which there are several remarkable
Strictures in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> but <hi>Moral Philosophy,</hi>
with which his Books are every-where fraught.
<hi>Solomon</hi> also was a most profound Philosopher, as
those Words in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 29, &amp;c, amply testify,
<hi>God gave</hi> Solomon <hi>Wisdom and Vnderstanding ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
much. His Wisdom excell'd the Wisdom of
all the Children of the East-Country, and all the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of</hi> Egypt. <hi>He spake of Trees, from the Cedar-tree
that is in</hi> Lebanon, <hi>even to the Hyssop that
springeth out of the Wall: he spake also of B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Iosephus</hi> adds, <q>after the same manner he
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:46315:553"/>
discours'd of All Terestrial Things: for he was
ignorant of no natural Things, he pass'd by none
of them unexamin'd, but philosophized con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
every one of them, and fully discuss'd
the Properties and Nature of them.</q> Thus he
was certainly the Greatest <hi>Natural Historian</hi>
that ever was: and his Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and that
which is entituled <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> abundantly inform us
what skill he had in <hi>Ethicks, Oeconomicks, Politicks:</hi>
so that we may justly stile him an <hi>Vniversal Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher.
Iob</hi>'s skill in the choicest Parts of <hi>Physicks</hi>
is evident from his excellent Discourses and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions
concerning <hi>Thunder,</hi> the <hi>Clouds,</hi> the <hi>Sea,
Chap.</hi> 26. concerning <hi>Minerals</hi> and other <hi>Fossiles,</hi>

and tame, with their chiefest Properties and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
are discours'd of in Chapters 39, 40, 41.</p>
                     <p>And here I must insert this, that the Knowledg
and Study of the <hi>Bible</hi> are absolutely necessary
in order to the Study of <hi>Natural Philosophy.</hi> It is a

                        </gap>
we have abundant Proofs of the Existence and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration

                        </gap>
so fully and demonstratively convince us of their
Being and Power as the Holy Scriptures. And the
grand Reason, in my Opinion, why so many reject
the Notion of Spirits, and run into wild and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Notions, which are the Consequent of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
is, because they are unacquainted with, and (which

them. We shall perpetually fluctuate without an
Adherence to these Infallible Records. The <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesian,</hi>
and indeed the whole <hi>Corpuscularian Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi>
depraves Mens Minds, unless it be temper'd by
these. Nay, I may say, the Study of Nature, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
from them, will lead us into Scepticism and
Atheism: for many Substantial Notions as well as
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> are utterly unaccountable without
Help from this Book. But this rectifies our Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions,
and gives us a true Account of the State
of Things, and of the Government of the World,
which is managed chiefly by Spiritual and Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Substances. This salves the most surprizing
Difficulties, by acquainting us with the Spring of
the Generality of those Motions and Transactions
which are observable in Natural Bodies. In short,
this will season and qualify our Speculations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Nature and all its Operations: for when
the Operations and Results of Matter are defective,
here we are taught to have Recourse to a Higher
Principle. Thus the Bible lays a Foundation for
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:46315:554"/>
our Study of Philosophy, and is it self the Best Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Philosophy, I mean on the foresaid Account,
because it assures us of the Existence of Spirits, by
whose Influence so many Works of Nature (and
those of the greatest Importance in the World)
are effected. This was known of old by the Name
of the <hi>Barbarick Philosophy;</hi> and 'tis frequently
call'd so by<note n="1" place="bottom">Stromat. l. 1, &amp; 2.</note>

shew'd that the <hi>Grecian Philosophy</hi> was derived from
this: Which indeed was the Confession of some

<hi>Hebrews;</hi> which is as much as to say, that all the
true Notions about God and Providence, and the
Souls of Men, and other great Doctrines in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,
are taken from the Jewish Writings, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
and Inspired Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>In the next Place, the Antiquity of <hi>Medicks,
Chirurgery, Anatomy, Embalming,</hi> is likewise disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
here: For <hi>Ioseph commanded the physicians to
embalm his Father, and the physicians embalmed</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 2. The Word here repeated is <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim,</hi>
and it is the proper Hebrew Word for Men
skill'd in <hi>Medicks,</hi> and there is no other. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Vatablus</hi> and some others are mistaken, who
fancy this Place is not meant of <hi>Physicians</hi> properly
so called, because this Term is translated <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and because they are bid to
<hi>embalm</hi> Jacob. Whence they infer that they were
not <hi>Physicians</hi> in the Sense that we use the Word in
at this day, <hi>viz.</hi> for such as take care of sick and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46315:555"/>
diseased Persons, and endeavour by their Skill and
Art to restore them to Health, but that they were
only <hi>Embalmers,</hi> that is, that their sole Office and
Employment was to take care of the dead Bodies,
and to preserve them from putrifying. But this
Misapprehension had its Rise from this, that they
judged of Physicians and their Employments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what they see now, according to the
Practice of these Days, which no Man of due Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
and unprejudiced Judgment ought to do.
For of old the Physician was both Chirurgeon and
Embalmer; yea, even in <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s time the
Work of the Physician and Chirurgion was not
different, but the very same. In Antienter times,
much more these, Professions were united, and
were the Employment of the same Person. It is
no wonder therefore that <hi>Embalming</hi> was annex'd
to it, and constantly went along with it, for the
Chirurgion or Physician (call him which you will,
or both) was the Man that had Skill to dissect Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in order to their Pollincture. He knew what
Parts to take out, and how, being acquainted with
the Situation of the Vessels: for Anatomy was first
of all practised among the Egyptians, as we may
gather from<note n="1" place="bottom">Nat. Hist. l. 19. c. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Pliny</hi> and others, who attest that the
Egyptian Kings used it to find out the Cause and
Cure of Diseases. By the <hi>Egyptian Kings using it,</hi>
is meant undoubtedly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their appointing and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
their <hi>Physicians</hi> to do it. These then knew
how to handle the Anatomick Knife: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
these Persons were skilful in Drugs, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sams,
Ointments, Aromaticks, and the Materials
that were sittest for that Business of Embalming:
wherefore this was their proper Work. As living
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46315:555"/>
Bodies were their Care, so were the dead ones;
and what they could not cure, they dress'd up for
the Tomb: those whom they could not keep alive,
they artificially preserv'd when dead. Thus it
was heretofore, and thus particularly it was with
the <hi>Physicians</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of whom this Text speaks,
and who are the first of the Faculty that are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
in Sacred History. And with this agree the
Records of the Antientest Historians among the
Pagans. <hi>Diodorus</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> relates that the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Medicines was from the Egyptians,
and particularly that some of them said that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius,</hi>
others that <hi>Apis</hi> a King of <hi>Egypt</hi> was the first
Inventer of Physick. <hi>Herodotus</hi> observes that the
Egyptians had more Experiments in Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
and chiefly in Medicks, than any other
Nation whatsoever. <hi>Strabo</hi> testifies that they were
hugely addicted to this Art, and reckon'd it among
their Sacred Mysteries: Which is confirmed by
what<note n="2" place="bottom">Lib. 29. C. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Pliny</hi> faith, that they used to deposite and
keep their choice Experiments of Physick in their
Temples. To be brief, <hi>Anatomy, Chirurgery</hi> and
<hi>Embalming,</hi> met together in these Antient Artists.
This was the triple Office and Work of the <hi>Rophim,</hi>
the <hi>Physicians,</hi> besides the more general Work of
<hi>Curing</hi> the Diseased. From what <hi>Iob</hi> faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
those that pretended to comfort him, we
may collect that there were some of this Prosession
among the Old <hi>Arabians;</hi> for otherwise he would
not have compared them to Persons of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
<hi>Ye are all Physicians,</hi> faith he, <hi>of no Value,
Iob</hi> 13. 4. Ye deal with me just as unskilful Men
in that Faculty do with their Patients, just as sorry
Quacks and Empiricks do with the Diseased: they
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:46315:556"/>
understand not their Malady, and so make false
Applications; their Medicines are good perhaps,
(as your Counsel and Advice to me are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
but they administer them in a wrong man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and without any regard to the Constitution

have to do with. Thus you deal with me, and
therefore are so far from curing my Distemper, that
you enrage it, and make it much worse. Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and were Students in this Art, whence they had
their Name, for <hi>Asa</hi> is the Chaldee Word for <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus;</hi>
and perhaps for this Reason this King had
the greater Esteem of those who were skill'd in
Medicinal Arts, and therefore put Confidence in
them so as to neglect to apply himself to God the
Sovereign Author and Giver of Health. And
from those Words in <hi>Ier. 8. 22. Is there no Balm in</hi>
Gilead? <hi>is there no Physician there?</hi> it is manifest
that there were Medicaments and Proper Persons
to apply them, for else the Prophet could not by
this Language set forth the incurable and deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
State of the Jews at that time. This way of
speaking implies that they had in that Country, in

the Balsam with Skill. This also is implied and

of its being not only the farthest Boundary of the
Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> on the West, but also of its being
the farthest Sea that they had any notice of:
Whereas if they had been acquainted with the
Wide <hi>Ocean,</hi> the <hi>Main Sea</hi> through which they
must necessarily pass to those remoter Parts of the
World, the <hi>Midland Sea</hi> would not have been by
way of Eminence called <hi>the Sea,</hi> yea <hi>the Great Sea,</hi>
much less the <hi>Vtmost Sea.</hi> But though it was but
a small River in comparison of the Vast Ocean, it
was a <hi>Great Sea</hi> in respect of the <hi>Dead Sea, the Sea
of</hi> Galilee <hi>or</hi> Genesareth, and other such like Lakes
which they were acquainted with, and which they
improperly call'd <hi>Seas.</hi> Again, <hi>Africk</hi> seems to be
the Place rather than any other to which <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
Navy was sent for <hi>Gold,</hi> there being several Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
here (as is confess'd by all) that abound with
that Choice Metal. These Reasons (besides those
offer'd in a former part of this Discourse, where I

believe that the Royal Fleet before mention'd sail'd

<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Africk</hi> is meant by <hi>Ophir,</hi> to
which that Fleet went. I offer it to the Learned to
be consider'd whether there be not an exceeding
great Affinity betwen <gap reason="foreign">

into the Latin Word is not to be wondred

of a Letter or two, especially when Words are
transferred out of one Language into another, as I
could shew in abundant Instances. Besides, this
Derivation of the Word is the more to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to, because the Common Etymologies that are
given of <hi>Africa</hi> are very sorry and groundless.
Wherefore though I have formerly asserted that
<hi>Ophir</hi> is not mention'd by Geographers, (which is

the Report among the Heathens, that the

<hi>viz.</hi> that the first Shipping of any Note was this of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> which went through the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi>
of which the <hi>Euxine Sea</hi> is a Part of Arm, (and

if we remember how the Poets are wont to

                     <p>It is probable that <hi>Astronomy</hi> also was the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Holy Man's frequent Contemplating those Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

Operations. But because there is no clear ground
for this, I dismiss it. Only this may be said, that
<hi>Astronomy,</hi> like the Sun the chief Subject of it,
had its Rise in the <hi>East:</hi> all Authors agree that
it was first known and practis'd in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> whence
a <hi>Chaldéan</hi> and an <hi>Astrologer</hi> were Terms converti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
and it is certain that the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi>
was of that Country, and was eminently stiled
by the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and was known and
distinguish'd by that Name. But that <hi>Iob</hi> (a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Arabian,</hi> and who lived, as 'tis thought by
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46315:560"/>
some, not long after <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time) was Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomically
disposed, is very clear from his univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Skill inall Points of Natural Philosophy, which
his Book is full of, and particularly from his men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning

Chambers of the South,</hi> Chap. 9. <hi>v.</hi> 9. and from other
Passages in 26 and 28 Chapters relating to the <hi>Sun</hi>
and <hi>Stars,</hi> to the <hi>Heavens</hi> and their wonderful O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations

<hi>Aholiab</hi> and <hi>Bezaleel</hi> were so famous, and on which
several Critical Remarks might be made. But I
will proceed to some other things.</p>
                     <p>Among the First Arts and Inventions, we may
reckon <hi>Skill in Arms</hi> and <hi>Warlike Feats:</hi> the first
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:46315:561"/>
Instances whereof are registred in sacred Story. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
thinks that <hi>Tubal,</hi> who was <hi>an Instructer of every
Artificer in Brass and Iron,</hi> was the first Inventer
of Arms and Military Weapons, they being made
of those Metals. A late<note n="1" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Burnet Theor. Tellur.</note> Writer was forgetful of
this when he said, <hi>There were not of old any Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that belonged to War.</hi> And how could there
be indeed, when he asserts that there were no
<hi>Metals</hi> in the Earth before the Flood? Which is
precariously said, and hath no Foundation at all to
support it; yea, it is quite contrary to the express
Testimony of Scripture, which assures us that
there were <hi>Brass</hi> and <hi>Iron</hi> in those Days. It is not
then wholly improbable that <hi>Weapons</hi> of <hi>Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>
were framed of these, and that the People of those
times went forth to Battel, though in the whole
History from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah</hi> there is no mention
of their Wars. Neither is there of some other
things, which yet we cannot but suppose to have
been, notwithstanding <hi>Moses</hi> is silent concerning
them. If we consider what are the great Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to <hi>War,</hi> viz. Lust and Passion, we have no
reason to disbelieve that there were Wars from the
beginning, tho they are not mention'd. It is
likely they were but rare then, partly because
they had not found out such expedite ways
of managing their Feuds as have been since, and
partly because the Numbers of Men were not
so great as afterwards: the Earth could bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hold them at that time than now, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
they had not occasion to quarrel about
their Territories, and to strive how they should
enlarge their Dominions. However, Hatred, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and desire of Revenge might push them on to
fall out one with another, and to proceed to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46315:561"/>
Acts of Hostility, and to bring Forces on either
side into the Field to decide the Quarrel in Battel.
But I grant there is no <hi>certainty</hi> of this, there is
nothing expresly deliver'd concerning any War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Enterprizes before the Deluge. The first that
we read of after it, is the Battel of <hi>four Kings
against five,</hi> four of <hi>Assyria</hi> and the adjoining
Parts, against five of <hi>Sodom</hi> and the neighbouring
Parts of <hi>Palestine,</hi> Gen. 14. 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after this was the Military Expedition of
<hi>Abraham</hi> and his <hi>armed trained Servants,</hi> v. 14.
whom he had instructed in Martial Affairs. This is
the first <hi>War</hi> or <hi>Battel</hi> that we read of in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
History, and is thought to have been about
<hi>A. M.</hi> 2030. It is certainly the first that is to
be read of in the World; for the <hi>Theban War,</hi> the
most antient that either Historians or Poets among
the Gentiles write of, was about six hundred Years
after this: and the <hi>Trojan War,</hi> that famous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
which Prophane Writers talk so much of,
and is one of the antientest Subjects of Humane Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
was not till <hi>A. M.</hi> 2760. or thereabouts.
Afterwards we read in the Sacred Writings of the
Wars of the <hi>Iews</hi> before and after their coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Canaan;</hi> which were as remarkable as those
of the <hi>Old Romans,</hi> and much more just and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
they were indeed generally <hi>Holy Wars,</hi> and
Battels of the <hi>Lord of Hosts.</hi> In <hi>Leviticus</hi> and
<hi>Numbers</hi> we read of their <hi>Laws of Arms,</hi> and
<hi>Councils of War,</hi> and in<note n="1" place="bottom">Jos. 8. 4. Judg. 7. 16. &amp; 20. 38. 2 Sam. 5. 24.</note> other places of their
<hi>Military Stratagems:</hi> and all along we are told
what were the <hi>Martial Preparations</hi> not only of
that Nation, but those they fought with.</p>
                     <p>From this Antient Register we are particularly

the same Hebrew Word is used that is in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
Texts, but is here rendered <hi>a Breast-Plate.</hi>
And in <hi>Ier.</hi> 46. 4. a <hi>Brigandine</hi> is our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Word for it. So that according to what may
be gather'd from this various rendring of it, it

seems to me to answer to the <hi>Cuirasse</hi> or <hi>Corslet-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi>

was chiefly designed to defend this <hi>Latter,</hi> and
thence had its Denomination. But some had it

                        </hi> the great Shield or Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,

and by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Jer. 46. 3. in both which
Places the two Hebrew Words aforesaid are
made use of. It was frequent among the <hi>Iews</hi> in
their Wars, as is manifest from 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 21. and
many other Places which are well known. Hence
<hi>David,</hi> a Great Warriour, so often mentions <hi>Shield</hi>
and <hi>Buckler</hi> in his Divine Poems, to set forth that
<hi>Defence</hi> and <hi>Protection</hi> of Heaven which he expected,
which he experienced, and which he wholly trusted

<hi>Escuage</hi> a particular <hi>Tenure</hi> or <hi>Service.</hi> The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of it we see in the Example before us, the
Great Philistian Warriour was waited upon into
the Field by his Military Squire, <hi>one bearing a Shield.</hi>
And besides this <hi>Tsinnah,</hi> this Great Massy Shield,
he was furnish'd with a lesser One, which is not
express'd by one of the foremention'd Words, but
is call'd <hi>Cidon,</hi> which we render a <hi>Target,</hi> v. 6.
and a <hi>Shield,</hi> v. 45. and was of a different Nature
from the common Shields, and (as I conceive) was
not only to hold in his Hand when he had occasion
to use it, but could also conveniently at other times
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46315:563"/>
be hung about his Neck, and turn'd behind: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis added that <hi>it was between his Shoulders,</hi> v. 6.
So I understand those Words, and truly I think
it is a more genuine and unforced Interpretation of
them, than what is usually given by the Jewish
Writers, and some others. And this <hi>Target</hi> (as
well as his <hi>Helmet,</hi> and some other Pieces of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
of which anon) <hi>was of Brass,</hi> which was
the usual <hi>Metal</hi> of which their Arms were made in
those Days, and in the Times following, as <hi>Homer</hi>
and <hi>Virgil</hi> testify, who mention Helmets, Shields,
Swords, Spears of Brass. This is evident from
<hi>Hesiod,</hi> and <hi>Alcaeus</hi> an old Poet quoted by <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus.</hi>
The like we learn from <hi>Statius</hi> in several
Places. The Arms of the <hi>Massageta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus,</hi>
were of this Composure. <hi>Lucretius,</hi>
speaking of the first Weapons that were used in
War, tells us that they were of <hi>Brass,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
of <hi>Iron,</hi>

                     <p>Lastly, the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Warriours, and all
Nations used this serviceable Weapon, to fence off
the Blows of their Adversaries, and particularly
to repulse their Arrows. The <hi>Grecians</hi> especially
affected a very large sort of Shields, which we may
gather from the Description of them in the Poets,
and from what the Lacedemonian Women, when
they sent their Sons into the Wars, used to say to
them at parting, <gap reason="foreign">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
relates that the Lacedemonians banish'd <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicolus</hi>
his Country, because he had said and writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that it was better for a Man to throw away his
Shield than himself, <hi>i. e.</hi> to perish in Battel. And from
what the same Author saith of <hi>Epimanondas,</hi> that
he asked when he was dying whether his <hi>Shield</hi> was
safe, we may infer that nothing was so dear to them
as this one Piece of Armour. And I can prove
that it was thus among the <hi>Eastern,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the <hi>Iewish Warriours:</hi> the loss of this Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
was excessively resented, as well as condoled
by them. If you ask me on what I ground this, I
answer, on 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 21. where it is a signal Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
of the Publick Mourning, that the <hi>Shield of
the Mighty was viley cast away.</hi> I apprehend this
to be the meaning of the Words; <hi>David</hi> a Man of
Arms, who composed his Funeral-Song, was sensible
how disgraceful a Thing it was for Souldiers to
quit their <hi>Shields</hi> in the Field: yet this was the sad
and deplorable Case of the Jewish Souldiery in that
unhappy Engagement with the Philistines, they
<hi>fled away</hi> (1 Sam. 31. 7.) and left their <hi>Shields</hi>
behind them: this <hi>vil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>sting away</hi>
of that principal Armour is the deserved Subject
of this Losty Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t's Lamentation. I propound
this Interpretation (or Conjecture, if you will
call it so) as preferable to any that I have met
with.</p>
                     <p>And further, it may be useful to observe that
their <hi>Shields</hi> were wont to be <hi>oiled,</hi> scoured and
polish'd, as indeed it was the Custom to use the like
Care towards their other Armour, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
from <hi>furbishing the Spears,</hi> Jer. 46. 4. <hi>and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:46315:564"/>
making bright the Arrows,</hi> Jer. 51. 11. But more
especially their <hi>Shields</hi> (which were Weapons that
they so highly valued and took a kind of Pride in, and
on which they generally engraved their <hi>Names</hi> and
<hi>Warlike Deeds,</hi> if they had atchieved any; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
those that had none of these, were call'd <hi>Blank
Shields,</hi> and were thought to be disgraceful, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that of <hi>Virgil,—Parmâque inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius

                           </gap>)</hi> these Weapons, I say, were careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
polish'd with Oil, and made exceeding Bright.
Whence two Places of Scripture may receive some
Light: the former occurs in the Chapter before
cited, where 'tis said, <hi>the Shield of the Mighty is
vilely cast away, the Shield of</hi> Saul, <hi>as if it had not
been anoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>ed with Oil:</hi> for so I render that latter
Clause, referring it to the <hi>Shield,</hi> and not to <hi>Saul;</hi>
and the Hebrew Text bears this Version best. The
meaning then is, the Shields were cast away and
trod under Foot as if they had not been made bright
with Oil, as if there had not been that care taken
about them. And that other Passage, <hi>Isa.</hi> 21. 5.
<hi>Anoint the Shield,</hi> is a plain Reference to this antient
Custom of polishing their Shields with Oil: and
therefore the Import of these Words is this, Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
and make ready that Weapon, and prepare
for Battel. I could also observe that as they anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Shields to give them a Brightness and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stre,
(for Glittering Arms were in great esteem
among Warriours) so they cover'd them with a
Case when they used them not, to preserve them
from being rusty and soil'd: thence you read of
<hi>uncovering the Shield,</hi> Isa. 22. 6. which signisies
preparing for War, and having that Weapon
especially in readiness.</p>

he calls them) these <hi>Sithed Chariots</hi> to <hi>Cyrus.</hi> But
from this (as many other things) we may discern
the Defect of these Historians, and their failure in
the Point of Antiquity. These great <hi>Iron Chariots</hi>
for Battel were much older than that Monarch.
We read of them in the Sacred History about a
thousand Years before his time; for <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots
without doubt were of this kind, which we
may infer from the great Number of them, which
was <hi>six hundred,</hi> and from <hi>the appointing of Captains
over them,</hi> Exod. 14. 7. which shews they were no
other than their <hi>Fighting Chariots.</hi> And we read
that about fifty Years afterwards the Canaanites had
got this sort of <hi>Warlike Vehicle,</hi> and used them in that
<hi>Champian</hi> Country, which struck Terror into the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46315:570"/>
                        <hi>Iews,</hi> and made them almost despair of conquering
that part of the Nation, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 17. 16, 18. I might
add that our Predecessors the <hi>Old Britains</hi> (as both
<hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> record) fought in these Chariots,
which (as they describe them to us) were fang'd
at the Ends of the Axle-trees with Iron Hooks or
Sithes. With these fastned on both Sides, and
standing out about a Yard in length, they cut down
their Enemies that came in their way. I remember
the Hebrew Word <hi>Ketzir</hi> is both <hi>Harvest</hi> and War,
(<hi>Exod. 23. 16. Isa.</hi> 9.) here we have too true an
Account of it, for with these <hi>Sithe-Chariots</hi> they
mowed Men down as some Corn at Harvest is wont
to be.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, We learn from the Scriptures that when
they were besieged of old, they made use of <hi>Engines
on their Towers and Bulwarks to shoot Arrows and
great Stones withal,</hi> 2 Chron. 26. 15. and when they
sat down before a Place and resolv'd to besiege it,
they <hi>dug Trenches,</hi> 2 Sam. 17. 20. they drew a <hi>Line
of Circumvallation,</hi> Lam. 2. 8. they made <hi>Ramparts,</hi>
they <hi>built Forts against it, and cast a Mount against it,
and set the Camp also against it, and set battering Rams
against it round about,</hi> Ezek. 4. 2. for though <hi>Carim</hi>

<hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 22. yet in this Place it seems to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to the former denotation, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Iron
Engines</hi> wherewith they batter'd down the Walls
of a Town. Of this sort is <hi>Mechi,</hi> Ezek. 26. 9.
(whence perhaps <gap reason="foreign">

War</hi> (as we render it) which they made use of to
<hi>set against the Walls</hi> (as you read there) to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish

may be this is that Military Instrument with which
they shot Stones into a City or besieged Place,

them of old instead of <hi>Mortars</hi> and <hi>Carcases.</hi>
Next I might observe that to give notice of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Enemy, and to bring the despersed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Country together to resist and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel

Place for this purpose (and which shews the
Antiquity of this Military Usage, and will give us an
Account of the first and most early <hi>Marshalling of
Armies</hi>) is <hi>Numb. 2. 2. Every Man of the Children
of</hi> Israel <hi>shall pitch by his own Standard, with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of their Fathers House.</hi> For the explaining of
which we must know that when <hi>Moses</hi> had received
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46315:571"/>
the Law and finish'd the Tabernacle, he mustered
all the Tribes and Families of <hi>Israel,</hi> and disposed
them for their March through the Wilderness.
This Great Army (as this Chapter informs us)
was divided into four Battalions or Squadrons, each
of which contain'd three whole Tribes. The first
contain'd the three Tribes of <hi>Iudah, Issachar,</hi> and
<hi>Zebulon:</hi> and every Tribe being distinguish'd by
his particular <hi>Standard,</hi> this Squadron marched un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Standard of <hi>Iudah.</hi> And it was peculiar
to this Tribe to encamp always on the East Side of
the Tabernacle, and to hold the first Place and
lead the Vanguard. The second Battalion consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Tribes of <hi>Reuben, Simeon</hi> and <hi>Gad:</hi> and
<hi>Reuben</hi>'s <hi>Standard</hi> was that which they were placed
under. These had the second Place in the Army,
and encamped on the South Side of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
The third Division marched under the <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi>
of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> to whom were joined the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of <hi>Manasse</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and they were si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
always on the West Quarter. The fourth
Squadron were rank'd under the <hi>Standard</hi> of <hi>Dan,</hi>
to whom belonged the Tribes of <hi>Naphthali</hi> and
<hi>Asher.</hi> These were placed on the North Side of
the Tabernacle, and always march'd in the Reer.
In every <hi>Standard</hi> or <hi>Banner</hi> there was a particular
<hi>Ensign</hi> or <hi>Badg</hi> by which those of that Squadron
were known. In that of <hi>Iudah</hi> which march'd in
the <hi>Van</hi> there was pourtrayed a <hi>Lion:</hi> in that of
<hi>Reuben</hi> a <hi>Man:</hi> in that of <hi>Ephraim</hi> an <hi>Ox:</hi> and in
that of <hi>Dan</hi> an <hi>Eagle.</hi> Where by the way we may
observe here the Invention of <hi>Badges</hi> and <hi>Coats of
Arms.</hi> The Tribes were distinguish'd by their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<hi>Scutcheons,</hi> which were of diverse Figures,
and ('tis not to be doubted) of different Colours.
Though truly this Invention seems to have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46315:572"/>
first of all in <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. where the several Tribes
have assigned them by <hi>Iacob</hi> their particular <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Ensigns</hi> and <hi>Armorial Cognizances,</hi> as <hi>Iudah</hi>
a Lion, <hi>Dan</hi> a Serpent, <hi>Issachar</hi> an Ass, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
were certain <hi>Arms</hi> or <hi>Badges</hi> by which they were
known and distinguish'd. In these and the forenam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Instances, <hi>Heraldry</hi> had its Original, hence it may
fetch its Pedigree. Thus that Noble <hi>Camp</hi> was dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and situated, thus the several Tribes and Princes
of them were marshall'd. Thus the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was
placed in the midst of the four Divisions of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
which pitched round about it, as a Guard to
Defend and Protect it. But I should note withal,
that the Tabernacle was more Immediately sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
by the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites. Moses</hi> and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
and <hi>Eleazar</hi> and his Brethren were lodg'd on
the East, at the Entrance of the Court of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle:
the Families of <hi>Cohath</hi> were placed on
the South, the Families of <hi>Merari</hi> on the North,
the <hi>Geshurites</hi> on the West: and all others that
were dedicated to the Service and Attendance
on the Tabernacle, were quartered near it. This
was the Excellent Order that was observ'd, the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Persons were placed next to the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
because of their Employment and Office: and
to guard both them and the Tabernacle, the whole
Host was drawn about them in a Circle. I might
further take notice that there was not a fixed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Ground from every part of the Camp
to the Tabernacle, for it was necessary that some
should be further off than others: but this was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
them, that the Limits of their travelling on
the Sabbath-Day should not be above two thousand
Cubits, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 3. 4. But by reason of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Acception of the <hi>Cubit,</hi> it is not easy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
exactly the Length of the Way which
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46315:572"/>
they were permitted to travel. If it was two
thousand Paces; it amounted to two Miles: but
most of the<note n="1" place="bottom">Buxtorf. Chald. Lex. p. 2583.</note> 
                        <hi>Rabbins</hi> agree that it was 2000 <hi>lesser
Cubits,</hi> which make a large Mile. So far the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
Part of the Israelites Camp was distant from
the Tabernacle, according to the general Opinion
of the Hebrew Doctors. This, whatever it is, is
call'd a <hi>Sabbath-Day's Iourney,</hi> Acts 1. 12. <hi>i. e.</hi> as
much space of Ground as it was lawful for the Jews
to go on a Sabbath-Day. This shall suffice to be
said concerning the Antient Situation of the <hi>Camp</hi>
of <hi>Israel.</hi> A very Curious and Excellent Prospect
it is, and worthy of our Observation, it being
the First Platform of a Military Encamping.</p>
                     <p>To close this Head, I will take notice of the
<hi>Vast Numbers</hi> which some of the Armies mention'd
in Scripture consisted of of old. That of the Jews
in the Wilderness (which I last spoke of) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Muster-Roll in <hi>Numb.</hi> 1. contain'd no less
than <hi>six hundred thousand and three thousand and five
hundred and fifty.</hi> There were enrolled about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
thousand fighting Men in <hi>Israel,</hi> and about half
as many in <hi>Iudah</hi> when <hi>David</hi> numbred the People,
2 <hi>Sam. 24. 9. 1 Chron.</hi> 21. 5. King <hi>Vzziah</hi> had
an Host of three hundred thousand and seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
and five hundred, besides a choice Band of two
thousand and six hundred, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 12, 13.
King <hi>Asa</hi>'s military Force consisted of about six
hundred thousand, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 8. And against
him came an Ethiopian Army of above a thousand
thousand Chariots, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. 9. whence we must
collect that the whole Force was much more Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
for the Chariots generally had more than
one single Person in them. King <hi>Ieroboam</hi> brought
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46315:573"/>
eight hundred thousand Men into the Field, of
whom five hundred thousand were slain, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
13. 3, 17. And other vast Numbers we read of
in the Books of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles</hi> that were
brought into the Field in those Days. Which I the
rather mention because some have questioned the
Truth of it, and have thought that it is by the
Fault of <hi>Transcribers</hi> that the Arithmetick mounts
so high. And I am sorry to find a Great Man,
whom I will not name, enclining this way. I
doubt not but if he had lived to revise his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
he would have expung'd what seems to favour
this; for so Great an Asserter of the Authentick
Verity of the Scriptures (as well as of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion) could not have done otherwise. But
this I desire may be considered by those that think
the Number of the Men in the foremention'd Armies
is mistaken by those who copied out the Bible, they
setting down (as they imagine) one Arithmetical
Figure instead of another; I desire (I say) this may
be consider'd, that the Numbers in these Sacred
Writings are set down in Words at length, and not
in Figures, which these <hi>Objectors</hi> did not think of;
and therefore those who transcrib'd the Bible did
not mistake the Numbers by writing down one Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
for another, and consequently these Mens
Conceit is groundless. Again, we are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what is said in <hi>Numb. 1. 45. they numbred from
twenty Years old and upward all that were able to go
forth to War:</hi> and so afterward they train'd up <hi>all</hi>
that were able to bear Arms unto Martial Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and Military Discipline: which if we consider, it
will not seem strange and incredible that the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those in their Armies was so great. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
the Cavil will vanish if we consult Pagan
Authors, and thence learn how numerous their
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46315:573"/>
Armies were of old. <hi>Ninus</hi> the third Assyrian
Monarch, rais'd an Army of seventeen hundred
thousand Foot, and two hundred thousand Horse,
and ten thousand six hundred Chariots of War,
and invaded <hi>Bactria</hi> with these Forces, as <hi>Diodorus
Siculus</hi> and other Good Authors relate. <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>roas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
the King of <hi>Bactria</hi> met him with four hundred
thousand fighting Men, say the same Historians.
And the foresaid <hi>Diodorus</hi> tells us that <hi>Semiramis</hi>
that celebrated Queen of <hi>Assyria, Ninus</hi>'s Relict,
carried an Army that consisted of three Millions of
Men into <hi>India:</hi> and <hi>Staurobates</hi> the King of <hi>India</hi>
encountred her with more numerous Forces, and
vanquish'd her. It is universally acknowledg'd
that <hi>Xerxes</hi> entred <hi>Greece</hi> with an Army of above
a Million of fighting Men. Thus <hi>Prophane</hi> History
may induce us to credit that which we meet with
in the <hi>Sacred.</hi> When we find such vast Numbers
mention'd in the former, we have no reason to
wonder at the like in the latter. And though, it is
true, there is a Disproportion between <hi>Iudea</hi> and
those Countries which I have named, yet if it be
remembred how Populous the one was in respect of
the others, and likewise that in time of War eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man that could handle a Weapon turn'd Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
the great inequality which some imagine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this and the others will soon vanish. This is
some Account of <hi>Martial Affairs</hi> which the Antient
Writings of the Bible give us: and though we
read since the like things in other Authors, yet
here we see the First and Earliest Instances of
them.</p>
                     <p>I might pass form Military Affairs to some <hi>Spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Diversions</hi> and <hi>Exercises</hi> which the Scripture
speaks of, and gives us the first notice of, as <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
which was the mighty <hi>Nimrod</hi>'s Sport, <hi>Gen.</hi>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:46315:574"/>
10. 9. (though, as was said before, under that
Term likewise his Tyrannical and Arbitrary Rule
is denoted to us) It is likely that he kill'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd
the wild savage Beasts that grew numerous
at that time, and became very troublesom and
noxious: for upon that signal Dispersion of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
they remain'd not together in so great a Body
as before, and thence the Beasts were more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable;
and therefore <hi>Hunting</hi> began to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to preserve themselves. But this Great Man
might follow this Employment also for Pleasure and
Recreation. So the first <hi>Hunting</hi> was for private
Delight, and publick Profit. <hi>Esau</hi> afterwards is

way for <hi>Artificial Baths</hi> aftewards among the Jews
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46315:574"/>
in their Gardens and Orchards: which, if we may
credit the <hi>Targum</hi> upon <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> are meant by
<hi>the Delights of the Sons of Men,</hi> Eccl. 2. 7. This
was the known Practice of the Persians, Greeks
and Romans, and other Nations; but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientest
and most innocent Examples are in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>viz.</hi> among the Egyptians and Hebrews. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Recreating and Pleasurable Entertainments I
had occasion to mention before, as <hi>Instrumental</hi> and
<hi>Vocal Musick,</hi> though I consider'd them chiefly as
they were used on serious Occasions. I will now
add <hi>Dancing,</hi> which also was sometimes on a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Account, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 20. where <hi>Miriam</hi>
and her Females with <hi>Dances</hi> (as well as Timbrels)
sang, and glorified God after the Deliverance
from the Egyptians. This <hi>Miriam</hi> may pass for
the true <hi>Terpsichore</hi> whom the Poets make the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter
of Dancing, she being the first famous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it. We read that <hi>David danced before
the Ark,</hi> 2 Sam. 6. 16. But it is not the Sacred but
Civil Use of this Exercise, which I am now to take
notice of. It is certain that a pleasant and decent
moving, a Graceful Agitation of the Body (help'd

the first and most natural expressions of Joy when
there was some great occasion for it. This we

of Mirth at times of solemn Feasting, <hi>Judg.</hi> 21. 19,

Comely Deportment of the Body, I see no reason

oftentimes degenerated into inexcusable Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
and Vice. The Idolatrous Jews made it
part of their mad Worship which they paid to the
Golden Calf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 19. The Amalekites af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

this is the frequent Companion of Luxury and

(yea and of the inferiour and ordinary Rank)
immoderately affect and addict themselves to this
Diversion. This Vanity seems to be part of the
Temper and rooted Inclination of the gay People
of this Age, as if the <hi>Punctum Saliens</hi> were yet in

might hope) dancing and playing it away. But
then, when we see that the Sting is rather encreased
than cured, and the Venom of Lust and Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery

cause to lament the fashionable Folly and Levity
of our Times.</p>

                        <p>We are furnish'd in the Bible with the Knowledg of the
first Vsages relating to Matrimony. Of Nuptial
Feasts; and other Antient Feasts. We have here
the first Notices of Buying and Selling, and the
Antient use of Money. We learn hence what was
the first Apparel, and what Additions there were
afterwards. The chief Ornaments of Men and
Women, viz. Crowns, Mitres, Frontal Jewels,
Ear-rings, (the occasion of wearing these at first,
and among what Persons and Nations, together with
the Abuse of them) Chains, Bracelets, Finger-Rings
and Signets. Changes of Garments.
The Antient use of White Apparel. Fullers

                     <p>THAT the Scriptures contain the Knowledg
of all the First and Antientest Usages in the
World, I will make good in the next Place
by speaking of <hi>Marriage,</hi> and several things that
have reference to it. Concerning which we have
the best Notices from this Authentick Book. There
we are told that Man was no sooner made but God
extracted a Woman out of him: and when he had
divided them, he presently joined them together,
so that a Conjugal Life became the first and blessed
State of Paradise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 21, &amp;c. The first Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that violated this primitive Law of Wedlock
was <hi>Lamech,</hi> who <hi>took unto him two Wives,</hi> Gen.
4. 19. and if we may believe<note n="1" place="bottom">Antiqu. lib. 1. c. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus,</hi> had 77
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46315:576"/>
Children by them. The Example of this first Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamist
was afterwards drawn into practice by the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and Polygamy became frequent, and <hi>Divorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
were permitted in order to the marrying of
other Wives. The first that kept <hi>Concubines</hi> was
<hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 25. 6. whose Practice was followed
afterwards by other Patriarchs, not without some
permission from God, but grew at last to a most
Scandalous Excess in <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s Days.
That there were <hi>Prostitute Harl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ts</hi> betimes we may
gather from <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. 31. and <hi>Chap. 38. v.</hi> 14, 15.
in which latter Place there are mention'd some
Circumstances whereby those Mercenary Women
were known in those times, as their <hi>Vail,</hi> their
<hi>sitting in an open Place,</hi> &amp;c. That they were <hi>vail'd</hi>
may be gather'd from the Practice of <hi>Tamar,</hi> but it
was with a proper and peculiar sort of Covering,
by which they were known from others, for all
the Sex generally in those Eastern Countries went
vail'd. It was not worn because those first Prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
were modest in respect of those since, (as some
have thought) but because they were Distinguish'd
by this from other Women. I know that <hi>Bochart</hi>
and some others attempt to infer from <hi>Isa.</hi> 47. 3.
and such like Places, that they were not <hi>vail'd;</hi> but
this, as I apprehend, is upon mistake, for those
Words have no reference to <hi>Harlots,</hi> but to <hi>Slaves,</hi>
and so the Learnedest Commentators agree. Their
placing themselves <hi>by the way side</hi> or in some <hi>open
Place,</hi> may be gather'd from the foresaid Example
of <hi>Tamar:</hi> and this was a long time afterwards
the usage among Persons of that infamous Character,
<hi>Prov. 7. 12. She is in the Streets, and lieth in wait
at every Corner;</hi> where by the <hi>Corner</hi> are meant the
chief and most eminent Places in the Streets, open
and to be seen. Wherefore we find her Seat to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46315:576"/>
be <hi>in the high Places of the City,</hi> Chap. 9. v. 14.
To this impudent Practice refer those Passages,
<hi>In the ways hast thou set for them,</hi> Jer. 3. 2. <hi>Thou hast
made thee an high Place in every Street,—at
every head of the way,</hi> Ezek. 16. 24, 25. So the
Roman Strumpets were wont to sit <hi>in triviis,</hi> in the
high Way where there was the greatest Resort
of People, as from <hi>Catullus</hi> and others might be
proved, if it were worth the while. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to our main Subject, that of <hi>Matrimony,</hi> we
see what kind of <hi>Treaty</hi> there was about it, <hi>Gen.</hi>
34. 6, 12. what the <hi>Contract,</hi> Gen. 24. 50, 51, 57,
58. what the <hi>Solemnizing</hi> of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 67. were
in those early Days. We read not of any Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in joining of Man and Woman. Mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
made Marriage. <hi>Wilt thou go with this Man?
And she said, I will go.</hi> Then when she was come
to his House, <hi>he took her, and she became his Wife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
To this some have thought those Words of the
Prophet, <hi>Hos.</hi> 3. 3. refer, <hi>I bought her for an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of Barly,</hi> as if they alluded to the antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
of Marriage solemnized <hi>per Confarreationem,</hi>
by a Cake of Bread or some Corn put into the
Bride's Hand (which here by the way I might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
was perhaps the Original of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>Bride-Cake</hi>
which hath been the constant Attendant at Nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials:)
But though that be questionable, yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that these Words have respect to the Antient
<hi>Buying of Wives.</hi> The <hi>Bridal Purchase</hi> here spoken
of by the Prophet, was partly with Corn and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with Money; for he saith <hi>he bought her to him for
fifteen Piece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of Silver,</hi> as well as <hi>for an Homer,</hi> &amp;c.
So that the <hi>Dower</hi> consisted in Money and Goods.
But we have a much earlier Example of this <hi>Dowry
or Gift,</hi> as it is call'd <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 12. where it appears
that there was wont to be given a certain Sum of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46315:577"/>
Money to the Father of the Woman who was
courted and designed for a Wife. And this may
be gather'd from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 25. for when 'tis said
<hi>the King desireth not any Dowry,</hi> it is implied that
although <hi>Saul</hi> in Craft seem'd to refuse a Dowry
for his Daughter, yet it was usual in those Days to
give it for a Wife. This is that which is call'd

                        </gap> by the Great Father of Poets and of all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

Practice in several Places of his Poems. Whence

                        <hi>they bought their Wives.</hi> And this Conjugal
Buying or Purchasing was reciprocal, <hi>i. e.</hi> it was
performed by both Parties generally, Husband and
Wife. It was the same Matrimonial Coemption
or Mutual Purchasing which prevails at this Day:
the Woman purchases the Man with her Portion
or Jointure, and he her with his Estate, or part of
it. The Simplicity of those first Ages was such
that there were then no such <hi>Ceremonial Rites</hi> in
their Nuptials as have been observ'd since. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it became partly necessary to have a Publick
and Solemn Celebration of Marriage after the
World was grown more numerous, to fix and
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>certain the Legitimacy of Succession in Families,
and to tie the Matrimonial Knot the faster in these
slippery times.</p>
                     <p>Yet this we may take notice of, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Nuptial Bonds were entered into
without Ceremony and Formality, yet they were
always attended with a <hi>Feast.</hi> Which ever
afterwards became fashionable among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

<hi>Leah</hi>'s Wedding, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 22. which lasted
seven Days, as may be gather'd from <hi>v. 27. Fulfil
her Week,</hi> i. e. stay till the seven Days of the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-Feast
be over, for so you will find it explain'd
in the next Verse. So <hi>Samson</hi>'s Nuptials were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a Festival which continued a
Week, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 14. 12. And this it seems was the
usual Term not only of these but all other great
and solemn <hi>Feasts,</hi> Esth. 1. 5, 10. And here I
might observe, that it is peculiarly recorded
that at <hi>Samson</hi>'s Marriage-Feast <hi>he put forth a Riddle,</hi>
and required the Bridal Companions to <hi>declare</hi> and
<hi>expound</hi> it some time before the Days of that Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
were ended. This was one way of diverting
and entertaining themselves at those times of Mirth,
as other Writers testify. <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi>
mention these among the Antients, telling us that
they were wont to propound certain Quaint Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems
to be solved by the Company, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
arose Battels of Wit. And from <hi>Athenaeus</hi>
we may be informed that these Enigmatical Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
were used at their Compotations. Another

                     <p>I will next enquire what antient Notices we have
from the Scripture concerning <hi>Buying</hi> and <hi>Selling.</hi>
We do not read that there was any Pecuniary Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
before the Flood, but 'tis likely that Swapping
or Bartering of one thing for another was the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46315:579"/>
Practice of those times (as it is still among the most
Barbarous Nations.) That the first way of traffick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was without Coin, was the Opinion of the Prince
of Philosophers,<note n="1" place="bottom">Aristor. Ethic. l. 5. cap. 8.</note> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>,
Before the Invention of Money Exchanging (saith
he) was in use. And even after the Flood this way
of Commerce did not cease, as when there was a
Dissention between <hi>Abraham</hi>'s and <hi>Abimelech</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
about the Well that <hi>Abraham</hi> dug, we read
that he <hi>took Sheep and Oxen, and gave them to</hi> Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,
which perhaps may denote his Bartering
for the Well, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 27. no less than furnishing
him with Beasts for Sacrifice. Whence perhaps
<hi>Kesitah,</hi> which signifies a <hi>Lamb,</hi> signifies also <hi>a
Piece of Money,</hi> Gen. 33. 19. and is so translated:
and the same Hebrew Word is used in <hi>Iob</hi> 42. 11.
and is rendred by the Syriac and Chaldee, Greek
and Vulgar Latin, <hi>a Lamb,</hi> because Cattel hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(the chief Commodity they had) was instead
of <hi>Money</hi> to them, and these they frequently
chang'd for other Commodities. Though I know
<hi>Grotius</hi> and some other Learned Interpreters think
this <hi>Kesita</hi> was that Piece of Money which was of
the Value of a Lamb, and for that Reason had the
Figure of that Creature stamp'd on it. So<note n="2" place="bottom">Nat. Hist. l. 33. c. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Pliny</hi>
tells us, that among the Romans <hi>Pecunia</hi> was so
named, because the first Money was mark'd with
the Figure of a Sheep or Ox, or some other Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.
<note n="3" place="bottom">De Re Rust. l. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Varro</hi> gives the same Reason of the Name:
And<note n="4" place="bottom">In Poplicolâ.</note> 
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> confirms this, telling us, that they
engraved on the Antient Coins the Figure of a Cow,
or a Sheep, or a Hog; though withal he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that it was the Opinion of some, that the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46315:579"/>
Reason why <hi>Pecunia</hi> had its Name from <hi>Pecus,</hi> was

                     </p>
                     <p>But to wave this, this we are certain of, that
when in process of Time Men saw that they had no
need always of one another's Wares, and so could
not change one thing for another, they invented
<hi>Money,</hi> which might be given at any time instead
of Commodities, and which was supposed to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
Exactly to the Value and Price of the things
which they bought: For, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith,<note n="5" place="bottom">

                           </gap> Eth. l. 5. c. 8.</note> there
was a necessity of having all things valued and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
by a certain Price, that so by this Means
there might be on all Occasions an equal and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd
way of Changing, <hi>i. e.</hi> Money for Goods,
and Goods for Money. Wherefore in the same
Place he saith,<note n="6" place="bottom">

                        </note> All things are measured and duly

Dictate of Reason, and the Necessities they were

way, because Goods and Wares could not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently

Ages of the Word. Yea, I gather that the use of
Coined Money was <hi>frequent</hi> in those Days, for that
is implied in its <hi>passing</hi> from one to another. And
from this time we constantly read that things were
purchased with <hi>Keseph, Money,</hi> properly <hi>Silv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

is generally translated <hi>a piece of Silver,</hi> but in Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Further, it might be observed that they <hi>weighed
their Money</hi> in those Days, as appears from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
before mention'd in <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 16. where 'tis
said, that Abraham <hi>weighed unto</hi> Ephron <hi>four b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

So you read of <hi>weighing of Money or Silver,</hi> Exod.
22. 17. <hi>Iob 28. 15. Ier. 32. 9. Zech.</hi> 11. 12. Yea,
their common Coin, a <hi>Shekel,</hi> had its Name from
<hi>Shakal, to weigh.</hi> And this was in use among the
<hi>Persians,</hi> for in <hi>Esth. 3. 9. to weigh is to pay.</hi> The
Reason of which was because generally their Money
was in Large Pieces, and very Heavy; and because
in Moneys the Accompt went by <hi>Shekels</hi> among the
Jews, and the common <hi>Pound-weight</hi> was <hi>fifteen
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:46315:580"/>
Shekels,</hi> therefore some used <hi>Great Weights</hi> to weigh
the Money which was paid to them for what they
sold: And the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ce you may understand the Meaning
of <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 5. where those are complain'd of that
<hi>made the Shekel great, viz.</hi> for their own Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and Profit. It is not unlikely that the Old
Romans had this Custom of Poyzing the Money
which they paid, or received in Paiment; whence
<hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                              <desc>•••</desc>
                           </gap>dere, expendere, appendere,</hi> are both <hi>to weigh</hi> and
<hi>to pay.</hi> Likewise hence (as I suppose) what is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Valuable</hi> and <hi>Precious,</hi> what is <hi>Choice</hi> and <hi>Worthy,</hi>
is said to be <hi>Weighty</hi> not only in the Idiom of the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> but among the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins:</hi> as on
the contrary those things are said to be <hi>Light</hi> which
are <hi>Vain, Vile, Little</hi> and of <hi>no Value.</hi> This way
of speaking (of which I have largely treated in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nother Place) had its Rise from the <hi>weighing of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>oney</hi> of old: Because their Coin went by Weight,
therefore what is very <hi>Valuable</hi> (as <hi>Money</hi> is always
reckon'd to be) is signified by <hi>Weight.</hi> But we
cannot hence infer that they did not <hi>tell</hi> their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
(as some have thought) for the same Money
that was <hi>weighed</hi> might be <hi>told,</hi> that there might be
no Cheat, especially if it were a great Sum. We
are not certain that the one did exclude the other:
but the telling of their Money, as well as the
weighing it, might be in use at the same time.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, the <hi>First and Antientest Apparel</hi> is to
be known out of this Sacred Volume. Here we are

being the Design of that Covering of Fig-leaves to
hide those Parts of the Body which by the Fall

there is no need of supposing such Instruments in

gay and trim as we go now) were clad in plain
Leathern Coats; yea she of the softer Sex, and
who was the Queen of the World, had no other
Gown to wear. This plain rude Habit, which was
to hide their Nakedness, and to defend them from
the Injury and Inclemency of the Weather, not
to adorn them, was the only Dress a long time:
but their Posterity by degrees found out other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials

                        </gap>
what we read, and that we may be confirm'd in this
Truth, (which I have so often urged) that the first
Rise of the most Antient things whatsoever is to
be derived from the Writings of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
The Head-Ornament known by the Name
of a <hi>Crown</hi> [<hi>Gnatarah</hi> or <hi>Gnatereth</hi>] was not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to <hi>Kings,</hi> but was made use of by others, as
is to be inferr'd from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 12. &amp; 23. 42. where
'tis reckon'd among the other usual Ornaments
appertaining to Women. It was worn by them at
solemn and extraordinary times only, and most of
all on the Day of their Nuptials, as the Jewish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
inform us. The better sort of these Attires
were gilt, the common ones were made of Flowers.
And that they were a Piece of <hi>Gentile</hi> Pomp and
Gaiety, might be proved from several Authors, but
I forbear. But there was a <hi>Crown</hi> which was proper
to <hi>Kings,</hi> and is frequently call'd not only <hi>Gnatere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi>
but <hi>Nezer,</hi> (which latter Name is never, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
given to the other Crown) this was the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Badg of Regal Authority among the Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 30. and Persians, <hi>Esth.</hi> 1. 11. &amp; 2.
17. &amp; 6. 8. (where the Word is <hi>Cether,</hi> and it is
call'd <hi>the Crown of the Kingdom,</hi> or <hi>the Royal Crown,</hi>
as we translate it) and among the Jews, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.
10. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 2. From <hi>Esth. 8. 15. Psal.</hi> 21. 3.
<hi>Zech.</hi> 9. 16. we may gather that this Royal Crown

by our Translators a <hi>Mitre,</hi> and sometimes a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi>

and was a Badg of Authority and Eminency, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from <hi>Iob 29. 14. Isa. 62. 3. Zech.</hi> 3. 5. The
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:46315:583"/>
Persian Kings and Priests were clad in this <hi>Cidaris,</hi>
as<note n="1" place="bottom">Cidarim Persae capitis vocabant insigne. Hist lib. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Curtius</hi> and other Historians acquaint us: and it
is not to be doubted that they had it from the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
High Priests</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> the former of which
wore a <hi>Mitre, Mitsnepheth,</hi> Exod. 29. 6. &amp; 39. 28.
and the latter <hi>Bonnets, Migbanoth,</hi> which were of
of <hi>fine Linen,</hi> Exod. 29. 9. &amp; 39. 28. (as well as the
Mitre) and are said to be <hi>bound upon their Heads,</hi>
for that is the true Import of the Hebrew Word
in the forecited Place in <hi>Exodus</hi> and in <hi>Lev.</hi> 8. 13.
which plainly shews that these <hi>Mitres</hi> and <hi>Bonnets</hi>
were of the Nature of <hi>Turbants,</hi> and so were the
same with the <hi>Tsaniph,</hi> which was a Covering rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
up in Folds, and tied about the Head, from
<hi>tsanaph, circumvolvere, circumligare.</hi> And indeed
<hi>Tsaniph,</hi> if we exactly enquire into it, will be found
to be the same Word with <hi>Mitsnepheth,</hi> only this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is with a <hi>Mem Heemantick</hi> in the beginning, and a
<hi>Tau</hi> in the End of it. If I had time I could shew
that other Ornaments were borrow'd from the
Jews, and that what God himself enjoined the
<hi>High Priests</hi> was afterwards used by the <hi>Eastern
Princes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the antient <hi>Head-Covering of Women,</hi>
I had occasion given me to speak of it when I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29. therefore now I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speak of what was <hi>meer Ornament:</hi> the most
eminent of which sort was their <hi>Frontal Iewel,</hi>
which though it was fastned on their Foreheads,
hung down lower, and thence is call'd <hi>Nezem Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aph,</hi>
a <hi>Nose-Iewel,</hi> Isa. 3. 21. <hi>Gemma in fronte pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi>
as the Vulgar Latin renders it: and St.<note n="2" place="bottom">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in Ezek. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>
tells us that the Women in his time had Rings
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46315:584"/>
or Jewels hung from their Foreheads dangling over
the Nose. Nor was this of old reputed an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
and unbecoming Ornament, for we find that
<hi>Rebekah</hi> was presented in the Name of her absent
Lover with this <hi>Forehead-Pendant,</hi> as a Pledg of his
Conjugal Faith and Love, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 22. For it is a
Vulgar Errour, yea 'tis a Mistake which I find hath
prevail'd among some Learned Writers, that Part
of the Love-Token which was sent <hi>Rebekah</hi> was an
<hi>Ear-Ring:</hi> there is no ground at all for it, for in
express Terms it is said that the <hi>Nezem Zahab,</hi>
the <hi>Iewel of Gold</hi> (as 'tis call'd in this <hi>v.</hi> 22. which
our Translators render a <hi>Golden Ear-ring</hi>) was put
<hi>gnal Aphah, upon her Nose,</hi> v. 47. or, as our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
themselves render it, <hi>upon her Face;</hi> for the
Word <hi>Aph</hi> is largely taken sometimes for the Face.
But we never find that it is taken for the <hi>Ear,</hi> and
therefore this place can't be meant of an <hi>Ear-ring,</hi> yea
our Translators themselves acknowledg as much
when <hi>gnal Aphah</hi> is rendered by them <hi>upon her Face:</hi>
wherefore there was no reason to render <hi>Nezem</hi> an
<hi>Ear-ring</hi> at the same Time and in the same Place.
Besides, the Women wore that sort of Ornament by
<hi>Couples,</hi> and consequently we may gather thence that
this Golden <hi>Nezem</hi> which was sent to <hi>Rebekah</hi> was
no Ear-ring, but a Pendulous Jewel upon her Face
or Forehead. <hi>Isaac</hi> had more of Generosity and
Courtship in him than to make an offer to his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress</hi>
of a Half-Present. The truth then of the
Matter is this, they had of old Forehead-Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as well as those that they wore in their Ears.
The plain and unquestionable Difference between
these is observable in <hi>Ezek. 16. 12. I put a Iewel on
thy Forehead, and Ear-rings in thine Ears.</hi> The <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zem
gnal Aph, the Iewel on the Forehead,</hi> or on the
<hi>Nose</hi> or <hi>Face,</hi> (for 'tis the same with <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 47.)
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46315:584"/>
is distinguish'd from the <hi>Ear-Ornaments,</hi> the Rings
and Pendants that hung at that part. Some have
thought (and St. <hi>Augustin</hi> was of that number)
that the <hi>Nezem</hi> before mention'd, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 22.
and the <hi>Nose-Iewels</hi> mention'd <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. were Rings
in their Nostrils; for, as this Father observes,
there was<note n="1" place="bottom">Mos Maurorum est ut inaures etiam in nari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a<note n="2" place="bottom">Thevenot, lib 3.</note> Modern Traveller informs us that at this Day

of the <hi>East,</hi> and particularly of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea.</hi>
Therefore we may conclude that the <hi>Nezem
Haaph</hi> was a Jewel for the Forehead, but had its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
from its hanging above or over the
Nose. So much of this <gap reason="foreign">

and that too in the forenamed Place in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
where it is plainly distinguish'd from the <hi>Ear-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament.</hi>
I thought therefore I was obliged to give
you a true and exact Account of the Original
Word. And truly if we observe what large
Searches <hi>Eustathius</hi> and <hi>Servius</hi> make into a single
Word in <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> and how busily and

upon the Words in this Holy Book, to be

part (the <hi>Ear</hi>) which is most affected and wrought
upon in <hi>Charms,</hi> and by which the Inchantment is
receiv'd. But the more particular and restrained
Word is <hi>Gnagil,</hi> Numb. 31. 50. <hi>Rotula, sphaerula,</hi>
a <hi>round Ring,</hi> from <hi>Gnagol Circulus;</hi> and the Plural

                        </gap>m were known by this Name, because they
hung at these Circles, these round Wires of Gold put
into the Ears. These then are the <hi>Ear-Ornaments</hi>
properly so call'd, being peculiar to this part alone,
and no other. It seems they antiently chose the
lower part of the Ear as the fittest Place to have
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46315:585"/>
little Incisions made in it, because it is spungy and
flexible, and will safely admit of these soft Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrations:
and indeed it seems as it were to
be made to receive some <hi>Ornament</hi> to hang there.
Yea, it is it self a king of <hi>Pendant,</hi> in respect of
the other parts of the Ear. Besides, this is a Part
in view, where Ornaments may be seen, which was
one design of wearing them. This might prompt
them at first to bore holes in this fleshy Part, and
hang Jewels in them. Likewise, the Ear is the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
of Hearing, and the grand Medium of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Discipline; it is on this account the most
Honourable Part of the Body, and therefore in
the first and innocent Ages they endeavour'd to
adorn and honour it with placing Jewels there.

                     <p>Again, from the Sacred Writings we may sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
our selves what People and Nations wore this
antient Ornament. Here we read that those of
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Race, particularly <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Family, were
decked with it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 4. By this it appears
that they retain'd the innocent Fashion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
whence they came, for it was customary with
the Assyrians to make these Apertures in their
Ears, and let the Light through them as it were,
according to that of the Poet,
<q>
                           <l>
                              <note n="2" place="bottom">Juvenal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sat. 1.</note> Natus ad Euphraten, molles quòd in aure fenestrae</l>

the antient <hi>Arabs,</hi> we cannot but conclude from
<hi>Iob</hi>'s accepting of an <hi>Ear-ring</hi> as a Present from his
Friends, <hi>Iob</hi> 42. 11. and wearing it for their sake;
for <hi>Nezem</hi> is one of the Words (as you have heard)

(which is sometimes signified by that Word)
because this was proper only to Women. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this was the usual Ornament of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
as several Historians since acquaint us. We
have a Proof of this in <hi>Num.</hi> 31. 50. where it is
enumerated among those Ornaments of the <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>
i. e. <hi>Arabians,</hi> which became a Prey to the
Jews when they slew all the Males, and took the
Women Captive. And there is another very
notable Proof of this in <hi>Iudg.</hi> 8. 24. where 'tis
recorded that the <hi>Ishmaelites</hi> (or Midianites, for
they were the same) who were a People of <hi>Arabia,
had golden Ear-rings;</hi> and 'tis added that they had
so <hi>because they were Ishmaelites,</hi> because by this means
they would take off the Imputation of Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
of being of the Race of the <hi>Bondwoman,</hi> which
some might object to them. They all made Holes
and Fissures in the tender Lobes of their Ears, and
therein wore these Ornaments to signify they were

                        <hi>Free;</hi> for this antiently was reckon'd as a Token
of Ingenious Breeding, and an Argument that the
Persons who were deck'd with them, were of some
considerable Rank and Station.</p>
                     <p>But how then came it to be a Sign of <hi>Servitude</hi>
among the <hi>Iews,</hi> for we read that they bored their
Servants Ears? I answer, this was not a Mark of
their being <hi>Servants,</hi> but it was a Testimony of
their Voluntary Subjection and Obedience to their
Masters, and a Mark whereby they might be known
to be Theirs. The Words of the Law are obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
<hi>If the Servant shall plainly say, I love my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
then his Master shall bring him unto the Iudges, and
he shall bore his Ear through with an Awl, and he shall
serve him for ever,</hi> Exod. 21. 6, 7. His great <hi>Love</hi>
to his Master made him continue in his Service,
and this <hi>Loving Service</hi> (for it was such, and not
a <hi>Constrain'd Servitude</hi>) was testified by the boring
of the Ear. The Perforation of this Part was signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant,
in that the <hi>Ear</hi> (as hath been said before) is
the Organ of Hearing, and consequently of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
<hi>To hear</hi> and <hi>to obey</hi> are synonymous, to
give ear and yield obedience are Terms convertible:
therefore the Ear was submitted to the Threshold,
and bored, to express the Person's submissive Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Hearkning to his Master. And it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that when the boring of the Ear was done,
they put some Iron or Brass Ring into the Hole, for
otherwise it would close up, and there would be
no Mark: whereas the Design was to mark the
Person, that he might be known to belong to such
a one. So that piercing the Ear was in order to
something else, <hi>viz.</hi> to have something put into
it by the Master, perhaps sometimes a Ring of
some value, if he had a great Esteem of him as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faithful Servant. This as a Visible <hi>Memento</hi> was
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:46315:587"/>
to hang at that Place, and he was distinguish'd
by it from others of better Rank, because it was in
one Ear only. This, as I apprehend, is the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Jewish Usage: and it is the more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and credible, because this Custom of boring the
Ear was used towards those Servants who were so
pleas'd with their Master and the Family, that they
would not part from them, they would live with
them continually, and be always in their Service.
The Master had a proportionable Kindness and
Love to such a Servant, and might reward him with
an <hi>Ear-ring</hi> of Silver, or it may be of Gold. This
Ornament was ever esteemed by the Antients as a
Mark of some Gentility, as a Badg of some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
and Creditable Estate in the World. Whence
the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who had no mean Opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and of their Descent and Gallantry, were
the most noted of all People heretofore for boring
their Ears, as we learn from<note n="1" place="bottom">Pertunde aures ut imitemur Arabas.</note> 
                        <hi>Petronius</hi> and others.

                        <hi>Romans,</hi> some even of the Men among them (but

                        <hi>Macrobius</hi> relates.
But a Multitude of Authors agree that 'twas the
Mode of the other Sex among them, the Wealthy
Matrons especially, to adorn that Part with Pearls
and Precious Stones: and they purposely made
their Incisions very large and wide for the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Rings and Jewels of a great Magnitude,
according to that of the Satyrist;

Furthermore, I take occasion from Scripture to
remark that this Ornament was heretofore used to
<hi>Idolatrous</hi> Ends; for else we can't give any Account
of the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Injunction to his Servants
and Houshold to <hi>put away the strange Gods that were
in their Hand, and the Ear-rings that were in their
Ears,</hi> Gen. 35. 2, 4. These two would not have
been thus join'd together, unless the latter had
been made use of in a Superstitious and Idolatrous
manner. Enchanted Rings were usual of old, as
we are informed from several Passages in History
besides that concerning <hi>Gyges.</hi> And this may be
one Reason perhaps why those Rings that were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the Ears were call'd <hi>Lechashim,</hi> (as we
heard before) <hi>viz.</hi> because they were wont to be
made use of in Enchantments. Gold Rings were a
sort of <hi>Talismans,</hi> and were used (as <hi>Petronius</hi> testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies)
by the People of the Isle of <hi>Samothracia,</hi> in a
Magical way, to drive away Diseases, and to do
strange Feats; and they learn'd this from the
Egyptians, he saith. An<note n="5" place="bottom">S. Augustin. de Doctr. Christian. l. 2.</note> Ecclesiastical Writer
upon the Place before alledged tells us, that among
the Gentiles their Ear-rings had in them the Effigies
of their Deities, and that they were made by them
the <hi>Phylacteries of their Gods.</hi> That they were used
in way of Magick, is attested by the same Antient
Writer, who reproves and condemns the<note n="6" place="bottom">Execranda super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitio ligaturarum, in quibus etiam inaures virorum in summis ex un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. in Gen. 35. 4.</note> Critick would infer, that the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46315:588"/>
Servants wore their Ear-rings (not as others
did, but) on the top of their Ears. But I conceive
there is no ground for this Inference from St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>'s
Words; for if we consult the Place, we
shall find that he speaks in general, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not of Servants any more than others. And
moreover, there may be another and more proper
Construction of <hi>summae auriculae,</hi> for <hi>summae</hi> may
be as much as <hi>extremae,</hi> and then not the upper part
of the Ears, but the lowest, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Tips of them
(where all Ear-rings are hung) are meant here.
And <hi>ex unâ parte</hi> seems to me to signify their wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Ear-rings on one Side only, not in both
Ears. This I conceive is the true and genuine Sense
of that African Father's Words. But the main
thing we observe from them is, that this sort of
Ornament was employed heretofore to wicked and
Diabolical Purposes; and thence were deservedly
call'd by this Pious Writer, in the same Epistle,
<hi>the Mark of the Devil.</hi> And this, it is probable,
was derived from that more antient Practice of
some of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Houshold before cited. As the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
used to conse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rate their Hair, their Clothes,
and things of all kinds to their Demons, so here
some of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Family engraved the Image of some
Idol on their <hi>Ear-rings,</hi> and wore them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the feigned Deities: Or perhaps the
Good Patriarch saw some ground to fear that they
would do thus, and therefore that these Ornaments
might not be serviceable to Idolatry, or (as <hi>Grotius</hi>
saith) left some Golden Calf should be made of
their Ear-rings, he bids them cast them away; and
when they had done so, he took them, and <hi>hid
them under an Oak,</hi> ver. 4. buried them and their
Gods together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:46315:589"/>
It is to be lamented that the Number of those
who dedicate their <hi>Ornaments</hi> to false Gods, and
make them serviceable to some sort of Idolatry, is
too great at this day.<note n="1" place="bottom">Lamprid, in Severo.</note> Indeed the fond Bigotry
of the Emperor <hi>Severus</hi> was reprovable, who,
when a pair of Pearls of inestimable Value was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to his Lady, order'd them to be hung at the
Ears of <hi>Venus:</hi> but there are those who wear the
richest Jewels themselves, and at the same time
devote them to this <hi>Goddess, i. e.</hi> they make them
wholly subservient to <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Lewdness,</hi> to Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness
and Luxury, and other vitious Purposes:
and when 'tis thus, <hi>Iacob</hi>'S Injunction should be put
in practice, the Choicest Ornaments are to be laid
aside, it is time now to inter these Pernicious Idols.
But those who know how to use their Ornaments
in a right manner, that is, to substract them from
all vicious Principles and Ends, to suffer them not
to administer to Levity and Vanity, to Softness and
Effeminacy, to lewd Desires and Inclinations, to
Pride and Vain-glory; these, and only these, are
the Persons to whom the using of them is lawful.
And this must more particularly be applied to that
kind of Ornament which I have been speaking of,
which seems to be no effeminate one in it self, both
because it was used by <hi>Men,</hi> and likewise because
'tis accompanied with some Hardship, and requires
some Valour to endure the piercing of the Bodkin.
They must bleed first before they wear it: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
those little Wounds are continually kept
gaping. And it cannot be thought unlawful and
vicious in its own Nature, seeing the <hi>Israelites</hi> deck'd
themselves with it, but are never reproved and
check'd for it. They are not blamed for wearing
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46315:589"/>
Ear-rings, but for making an Idol of them. The
religious <hi>Rebekah,</hi> who wore the <hi>Frontal</hi> Jewel, did
not boggle at the <hi>Auricular</hi> one; for questionless
this is comprehended in the <hi>Keli Zahab,</hi> the <hi>Iewels
of Gold</hi> which she was presented with, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 53.
Yea, Holy <hi>Iob,</hi> whose Spirit had been unspeakably
broken and mortified by his Afflictions, yet refused
not this Innocent Gift (which was of general Use
in that Country) from the Hands of his Friends.
So much of this Ornament, which was the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entest,
the most Universal, the Simplest, and the
most Unaffected of any that we read of in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Records: on which Accounts it hath the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence
of all others. But this and other Ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings,
in these licentious times, are abused by their
<hi>Commonness:</hi> whereby that Distinction which ought
to be made between the different Ranks of Persons
is taken away; and that Money is lavish'd in a
needless and unbecoming Dress, which should be
laid out in Bread.</p>
                     <p>Again, the <hi>Neck</hi> was not destitute of its proper
Decking, <hi>viz. Chains.</hi> These in great Persons
were Ensigns of Authority and Dignity (as they
are in several Places at this Day): thus <hi>Pharaoh put
a Gold Chain about</hi> Joseph'<hi>s Neck,</hi> Gen. 41. 42. and
<hi>Belshazzar</hi> did the same to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 5. 29. This
was a general Ornament of the <hi>Midianites</hi> or <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi>
as appears from <hi>Numb.</hi> 31. 50. where it is
mention'd with a great many others that were in
fashion among that People. It was used by the
<hi>Iews,</hi> as we may gather from <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 9. It was
more especially the graceful Attire of the softer
Sex, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 1O. <hi>Charuzim</hi> are Pearls on a String
orderly disposed, as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> explains the Word.
And these Necklaces of Pearl are, it is probable,
meant by <hi>Gnanak,</hi> Cant. 4. 9. <hi>One Chain, i. e.</hi> one
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46315:590"/>

<hi>Neck-Ornaments</hi> (we may call them <hi>Counter-points)</hi>
much antienter than these, is mention'd, <hi>Iudg. 5.

                     <p>The <hi>Arms</hi> or <hi>Wrists</hi> were wont of old to have
their peculiar Adorning, <hi>viz.</hi> with <hi>Bracelets:</hi> Of
which we read first of all in <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 30. these as
well as the <hi>Forehead-Pendants</hi> being presented to
<hi>Rebekah</hi> by her Servant <hi>Isaac.</hi> We find it in the
Catalogue of the Female Ornaments used by the
<hi>Iews,</hi> Ezek. 16. 11. And this was worn not only
by Women but Men, <hi>viz.</hi> such as were of some
considerable Figure in the World, as <hi>Iudah,</hi> Gen.
38. 18. and King <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 Sam. 1. 10. And from
<hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 22. it may be concluded that both Sexes
at first made use of them. As to the Nature of
them, I shall not here enquire into it: only I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
this, that from the several Distinct Names
given in Scripture to them, as <hi>Tsemidim, Petilim,
Chach, Atsgnadah,</hi> we may infer, that there were
several sorts and kinds of them. It is certain that
the first mention of them is in the Bible: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
we read of them in Profane Authors.
These tell us, that even Men, yea Martial Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
did not disdain this Finery; of which we have a
remarkable Instance in the Sabines, who inveigled
<hi>Tarpeia</hi> to betray the Capitol to them, by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to give her what they wore on their left Arms,
by which she thought they meant their <hi>Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Treason, threw in their <hi>Bucklers</hi> to boo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wherewith the poor faithless Maid was stifled and
overwhelmed.</p>
                     <p>We read of another Ornament, which was for
the <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Fingers,</hi> viz. a <hi>Ring, Tabbagnath.</hi>
This is reckon'd among other Habiliments of the
<hi>Midianites,</hi> Numb. 31. 50. and of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 21. And that it was an Innocent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
among the Jews afterwards, we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the <hi>Parable,</hi> where the kind Father put a
Ring on the Hand of the returned Spendthrift,
<hi>Luke</hi> I5. 22. And St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">

Sometimes their Rings were garnished with <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Stones,</hi> for we read of <hi>Gold Rings set with the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryl,</hi>
Cant. 5. 14. Some of them were antiently
wont to be cut and engraved, and so were made
use of as <hi>Seals.</hi> The first mention of this <hi>Chotham,</hi>
this <hi>Sealing Ring,</hi> is in <hi>Gen,. 38. I8. Iudah</hi> gave his
Daughter (whom he took to be another Female)
a <hi>Signet,</hi> as a Pawn, to assure her of something of
another nature. Perhaps some began then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth
Virgins with a <hi>Ring,</hi> and so this Pledg was a
Symbol of <hi>Iudah</hi>'s espousing <hi>Thamar.</hi> If this were
so (which I think can't be disproved) the <hi>Wedding
Ring</hi> is of greater Antiquity than is imagined. The
<hi>Seal-Ring</hi> was worn on their right Hands, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. 24. It was of great Use, and
much prized, and therefore carefully kept, as this
Place and others, <hi>Cant. 8. 6. Hag.</hi> 2. 23. import.
And not only <hi>Iews</hi> but <hi>Persians</hi> frequently used this
sort of Ring, <hi>Esth. 3. 12. &amp;</hi> 8. 8. and it was a Badg
of <hi>Authority</hi> among them, for <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> pluck'd
off his Ring from his Finger, and bestowed it on
<hi>Haman,</hi> Esth. 3. 10. and afterwards on <hi>Mordecai,

Where by the way we may observe, that<note n="1" place="bottom">Nat. Hist. l. 33. c. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Pliny</hi>
is no good Antiquary when he saith the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
knew not the Use of these <hi>Rings.</hi> And he further
shews himself deficient in Antiquity, when he tells
us, that they were not used in the Time of the
Trojan War (because forsooth <hi>Homer</hi> doth not
make mention of them): for this Instance was at

take notice that this was according to the Rank,

in succeeding times they were clad on Festival

Of this particular sort of Garments used at Feasts

                     <argument>
                        <p>Here we are informed concerning the Primitive Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Burying. Graves and Sepulchres were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
in the Fields, and without the Walls of Cities.
They usually embalmed the dead Bodies. Why they
sometimes burnt them. Burning also signifies Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming.
There was a Difference between the Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Burning of the Jews and of the Heathens. The
Manner and Time of Mourning for the Dead.
Both Vocal and Instrumental Musick used at Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.
The Antiquity of Funeral Monuments. The
old way of erecting great Heaps of Stones over the
dead. Stone-heng is a Sepulchral Monument, and
in imitation of it. Anah's Invention of Mules.
Writers borrow from one another. The Bible only is
the Book that is beholden to no other. Here is the
Antientest Learning in the World: and that of all
Kinds. 'Tis common with Authors to contradict
themselves, and one another: they are uncertain, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricous,
and fabulous. But the Divine Writers alone
are certain and infallible. How strange and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
soever some of the Contents of this Holy Book
may seem to be, they justly command our firm Assent
to them.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>HERE, and only here, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ind the first Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Burying</hi> or <hi>Inhumation;</hi> the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of which is greater than is commonly
thought. Man's Original and Interment are both
joined together, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 19. for he is told by God
himself, that he must <hi>return unto the Ground, because
out of it he was taken:</hi> and that he may be assured of
it, it is repeated in the same Place, <hi>Dust thou art,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:46315:595"/>
and to Dust thou shalt return.</hi> Man acts in a Circle,
he goes back to his first Principle, to the same
Point again, the Earth of which he was compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Here is the Primitive Law of <hi>Burial,</hi> i. e. of
committing the Body to the <hi>Earth</hi> (which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<hi>Interring</hi>): this was instituted by God, and
this is the most proper way of disposing of the dead
Body. Of this the Pious Sufferer speaks, saying,
<hi>Naked came I out of my Mother's Womb, and naked
shall I return thither,</hi> Job 1. 21. Having in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Clause mention'd his <hi>Mother's Womb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and the
<hi>Earth</hi> being as it were his <hi>Mother,</hi> he saith, he shall
return <hi>thither,</hi> as if he had mention'd the <hi>Earth.</hi>
Therefore, according to <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and some other
Expositors, his <hi>Mother's Womb</hi> is interpreted <hi>the
Earth.</hi> But there is something more than this,
which hath not been taken notice of by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
therefore the better to shew the Tenour of
the Words, I desire it may be observed, that it is
in the immediately foregoing Verse said, Job <hi>fell
down upon the Ground,</hi> grovell'd upon the bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <hi>Earth,</hi> and then he took occasion to utter these
Words, <hi>Naked came I,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had said, I
am here laid low upon the <hi>Ground,</hi> which reminds
me of my original Extraction: out of this I and
all Mankind were first taken, as we were since out
of our <hi>Mothers Wombs,</hi> and to the <hi>Ground</hi> we must
return again, which is the <hi>Mother</hi> of all. This, as
I conceive, is the true Meaning of the Words,
which could not have been discover'd without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to the foregoing Verse, to which these
have a plain Reference. This Notion hath been
entertained by Pagan Writers when the <hi>Earth</hi> is
called by them <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but none
of them mention (because they were ingnorant of)
that first and original Order of Burial, <hi>Vnto Dust
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46315:595"/>
thou shalt return,</hi> on which this is founded. Man
by these Words is appointed to be laid in the
<hi>Ground,</hi> to be buried in the Earth. In pursuance
of which Order Men have been naturally enclined
to take care of decent <hi>Burial,</hi> and to bestow the
Bodies of the Dead in the Earth. Therefore
<hi>the burying with the Burial of an Ass,</hi> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
no burying at all, is abhorr'd by Mankind,
and is threatned as a Judgment from Heaven, <hi>Ier.

                        <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> took <hi>Iehoiakim</hi>
(who is the Person to whom this is threatned) and
kill'd him, and ripping up an Asses Belly, buried
him in it, which this Writer saith is the fulfilling
of the Prophecy. It is rather to be understood of
his being not buried at all, but expos'd to the Air
and Putrefaction above ground (as Beasts are) he
<hi>being cast forth beyond the Gates of Ierusalem,</hi> as it
follows in the next Clause; and more expresly
in <hi>Ier. 36. 30. his dead Body was cast out in the
Day to the Heat, and in the Night to the Frost.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Though <hi>Burial</hi> was used from the beginning, yet
the first Instance we meet of it is that in <hi>Gen. 23.
19. viz.</hi> of <hi>Abraham's</hi> burying <hi>Sarah,</hi> to which
purpose he bought <hi>a Field</hi> with a <hi>Cave</hi> in it, wherein
he lodg'd his beloved Wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23. 17, 18, 19.
and there afterwards he was buried himself, <hi>Gen.
25.</hi> 8. and in the same Sepulchre were deposited
the Corps of <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebekah, Iacob</hi> and <hi>Leah,
Gen.</hi> 49. 31. This then we are certain of, that
<hi>Fields</hi> were the first Places of Burial, (I mean the
first that we read of) and <hi>Caves</hi> the first particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Repositories of the Dead. And thus general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was afterwards, so far as we have any Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:46315:596"/>
from these Holy Records. The Burying-Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were in the <hi>Fields,</hi> and not within Cities and
wall'd Towns. Only here I must premise that
there were some few <hi>Exceptions,</hi> as that in 1 <hi>Sam.
25. 1. they buried</hi> Samuel <hi>in his House at</hi> Ramah.
There were at that time some Persons interr'd pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately,
and then their Corps were not carried
abroad. This was the Case of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who though
he had been an eminent Person, yet chose an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
Burial. Nay, it is likely that all Persons
at first of a mean Figure and private Capacity,
were lodg'd when they were dead, in the same
Ground on which they dwelt when they were alive.
Which is <hi>Servius</hi>'s Remark on a Passage in <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                        <note n="1" place="bottom">Apud majores omnes homines in suis domibus sepeliebantur. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of this private Interment was <hi>Ioab,</hi> who
though he had been a Great Man, yet went off the
Stage in very ill Circumstances, and <hi>was buried in
his own House in the Wilderness,</hi> 1 Kings 2. 34. And
King <hi>Manasses</hi> who had been so exorbitant an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
voluntarily chose a mean and humble Grave in
the <hi>Garden of his own House,</hi> 2 Kings 21. 18. as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself unworthy of the Royal Sepulchre of
his Fathers, which was <hi>in the City of David.</hi> And
here also is remarkable another Exception, <hi>viz.</hi> as
to the Burial of some of the <hi>Iewish Kings,</hi> who
were not buried without the Walls, but in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

1 Kings 11. 43. <hi>Iehoram,</hi> 2 Chron. 21. 20.
and others. The rest had a Royal Burying-place
without the City, and King <hi>Vzziah</hi> being a Leper,
was not interred with some of the other Kings,
but <hi>in the Field of the Burial which belong'd to the Kings,
2 Chron.</hi> 26. 23. And in the <hi>Fields</hi> or Places sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from their Cities and great Towns, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
disposed of their Dead heretofore. <hi>Rachel
was buried in the way to Ephrath,</hi> i. e. <hi>Bethlehem,
Gen.</hi> 35. 19. Not to speak of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Burial <hi>in a
Valley,</hi> Deut. 34. 6. which was of God's own dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
we read that <hi>Aaron</hi> before him was buried <hi>on
Mount Hor,</hi> Numb. 20. 28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 6. and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>
after both these <hi>on Mount Ephraim on the Side

<hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Sepulchre, where our Saviour was laid, was

Place where he was crucified there was a Garden.</hi> And
that the Graves of the Jews were without the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
is evident also from <hi>Mat. 27. 52, 53. The
Graves were opened, and many Bodies of Saints which
slept arose, and came out of the Graves, and went into

This was the Law and Practice of the <hi>Greeks,</hi>
and from them the <hi>Romans</hi> borrow'd this Custom,
who (as several Authors witness) buried none

and High-way Sides: whence the Epitaphs were

                        <hi>came afore-hand</hi> in

Work which she and others of her Sex after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
came to perform to their Dear Master, by
<hi>bringing sweet Spices to his Sepulchre,</hi> Mark 16. 1.</p>
                     <p>But though committing the Body to the <hi>Ground</hi>
(in order to which <hi>Embalming</hi> was used) was the
generally received Custom of the Jews, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
but very rarely, another was practis'd by
them, and that was <hi>Burning</hi> the dead Bodies, or
some part of them at least. Thus <hi>they took the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46315:598"/>
of</hi> Saul <hi>and of his Sons</hi> from the Place where
the Philistines had hung them up, <hi>and came to</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>besh,
<hi>and burnt them there,</hi> 1 Sam. 31. 12. They laid
the dead Bodies on a Pile of Wood, and consumed
the Flesh of them to Ashes, but <hi>they buried their
Bones</hi> (which were not consumed by the Fire) <hi>under
a Tree at</hi> Jabesh, <hi>v.</hi> 13. But this was an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Case; for these Bodies had hung so long in
the Air, that the Flesh was putrified and rotted,
and partly eaten with Worms, so that the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them to Fire was the best way of Funera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at that time. There is another Instance of this
Funeral Conflagration in <hi>Amos 6. 9, 10. If there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
ten Men in one House, they shall die: and a Man's
Vncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him, to
bring out the Bones out of the House.</hi> But as we may
easily perceive from the Words themselves and the
Context, this was in the time of a great Pestilence,
which raged so furiously, that there was scarcely a
sufficient Number of Men left to bury the Dead,
and it was unsafe at such a Time to go abroad, and
carry the Corps in solemn manner to the Grave,
and perform the Rites of Funeral. In such extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<hi>Burning</hi> was a good Expedient, because after
the Carcase was reduced to Ashes, the Bones (which
being hard and solid remain'd unburnt) might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
be carried out of the infected House, and laid
in the Ground. Wherefore from this Place in
<hi>Amos,</hi> and from the foregoing one in <hi>Samuel,</hi> I
think it is evident that they burnt the Corps among
the Jews sometimes, though very seldom. There
in another <hi>Burning</hi> at Funerals which we cannot but
take notice of: so concerning King <hi>Asa,</hi> 'tis said
that <hi>they laid him in the Bed</hi> (the Funeral Bed, 2 <hi>Sam.
3. 31.) which was filled with sweet Odours, and divers
kinds of Spices, prepared by the Apothecary's</hi> (or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician's)
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46315:599"/>
                        <hi>Art,</hi> (for this King <hi>sought unto them,</hi> and is
now come under their last Hands) <hi>and they made a
very great Burning for him,</hi> 2 Chron. 16. 14. which
cannot be meant of burning his Corps, for 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
said before in the same Verse, <hi>they buried him
in his own Sepulchre:</hi> wherefore this was not a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Body in the Fire, but only an usual Piece of
State which was observ'd at the Funeral Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Kings and Great Personages. It was, it
seems, the Custom not only to <hi>embalm</hi> the Bodies
of such eminent Men, (for that is meant here by <hi>the
sweet Odours and divers kinds of Spices prepared by the
Apothecary's Art,</hi> Whose Employment it partly was
to dress Men for their Funerals) but to set up a
great Heap or Pile of this sort of Aromaticks, and
make a Bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ire of them, as Triumphal Valedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the departed. Some add that it was the
Custom to burn the Clothes, Chariots, Armour,
and other things belonging to the Dead, and that
this was in Honour of their Memory. King <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
though he died a Captive, was not denied
this last Honour and Obsequy, <hi>Ier. 34. 5. He died
with the Burnings of his Fathers, the former Kings that
were before him: so they burnt Odours for him, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
him.</hi> On which place <hi>Maimonides</hi> notes, that
the Jews did not use to burn the dead Bodies, but
that this is meant only of burning their Clothes,
and some other things appertaining to them, with
Frankincense and other Aromatick Drugs, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the deceased. But though it was no Jewish
Custom to burn the dead Bodies, yet it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that they extracted the <hi>Entrails,</hi> (as was usual
in <hi>Embalming,</hi> to which this and the former Texts
do partly refer) and consumed them in the Fire with
those Perfumes before spoken of. So that the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rephah,</hi>
the Burning which you read of in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46315:599"/>
Place was not (as is imagined by Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
generally) <hi>for Royal State</hi> only, but it was in
was of <hi>Pollincture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this Opinion was first suggested to me from
2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 18, 19. where the reason is assigned
why the People of <hi>Israel</hi> refused to pay this Funeral
Duty to K. <hi>Iehoram, He was smote in the Bowels with
an incurable Disease, and his Bowels fell out by reason
of his Sickness,</hi> of which he died: <hi>and his People
made no Burning for him, like the Burning of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
Observe it, his <hi>Bowels</hi> being rotted, and by
that means loosned, fell out, and were immediately
disposed of by reason of the Stench, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
these Parts could not be pompously laid on
the Fire with sweet Odours, as was the Custom,
and (as the Consequence of this) there could be no
<hi>Funeral Burning</hi> for him. I know 'tis generally
said by Expositors, that this Ceremony was omitted
meerly because this <hi>Iehoram</hi> was a wicked King:
and <hi>Grotius</hi> goes along with them, and adds, that
they paid a greater or lesser Honour to their Kings
when they were dead according to the Merits of
their Actions when they were alive, which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds
as a Good Custom. But though this might
be true, yet it is not the Reason that is here given
(which we are now enquiring into) why there was
no <hi>Burning</hi> for <hi>Iehoram.</hi> The true Cause of this
Omi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sion was (as this Text acquaints us) <hi>the falling
out of his ulcerated Bowels by reason of his Sickness,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it became impossible to have the usual <hi>Burning
of his Fathers,</hi> whose Bowels were entire and sound,
and so capable of being burnt in a solemn Manner
with all sorts of Spices and Odours. This was a
Concomitant of the <hi>Embalming,</hi> and so accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
in the forenamed Instances of <hi>Asa</hi> and <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>
'tis probable their <hi>Entrails</hi> were taken out
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46315:600"/>
(according to the Custom of <hi>Embalming</hi>) in order
to have their dead Bodies replenish'd with odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Compositions: and <hi>the Burning for them</hi> spoken
of in the respective Places, is meant of the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of their Intestines in the Fire with sweet-smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Gums and precious Ointments. But <hi>Iehoram</hi>
was wholly incapable, because of the unusual Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady
whereof he died, of this Fragrant Burning,
which was the Funeral Ceremony generally used at
the Deaths of his Progenitors. This I take to be
the genuine meaning of the Place: but however,
I submit this to the Judgment of Learned and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial
Criticks, who (whether this Comment be
true or conjectural only) will not disdain this free
offer of my Sentiments on this Text. It appears
from what hath been said that the <hi>Funeral Burning</hi>
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> was not of the
same kind. The former was only a committing of
the Bowels of the Dead to the Flames, the latter
was a Burning of their whole Bodies. Besides,
among the Jews their Conflagration was used to
their Kings and Great Ones only, but among the
Pagans to all. <hi>Rurying in the Ground,</hi> as<note n="1" place="bottom">Nat. Hist. I. 7. c. 54.</note>

and others, of <hi>Burning the dead Bodies;</hi> for this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had its Rise, he saith, from the barbarous and
inhumane digging up of the Carcases by Enemies:
to prevent which they consumed a great Part of
them in their Funeral Pyres, and what what was remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was preserv'd in Sepulchral Urns and Pitchers,
and deposited so deep in the Earth that they were
for the most part out of the Reach of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.
This was the Custom of the Old Germans,
<hi>as Tacitus</hi> reports: and from other Authors it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:46315:600"/>
that the Antient Galls, Spaniards, and other
Nations, were no Strangers to it. Yea, some Old

the Flaming, the Blazing Obsequies of <hi>Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
King of the Britains. This Pagan Usage was
first left off among the Romans in the Reigns of the
<hi>Antonines.</hi> And when Christianity got a firmer
Footing in the World, it was quite laid aside and
extinct, and they return'd to the old Primitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of burying the dead Bodies in the <hi>Earth,</hi>
from whence they had their Original.</p>
                     <p>Of other things relating to <hi>Funeral Rites</hi> we have
the antientest Account in these Inspired Writings:
as namely, that they used to <hi>mourn</hi> for the Dead
in a solemn manner, <hi>rending their Garments,</hi> and
<hi>putting on Sackcloth,</hi> as may be gathered from what
<hi>Iacob</hi> did, thinking his Son <hi>Ioseph</hi> was dead, <hi>Gen.</hi>

Texts, which make mention of exchanging
their usual Habit for <hi>Hair-cloth,</hi> or some such coarse

whereby they used to testify their Grief. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,

Prophet is here forbid upon the Death of his Wife
to use any such Funeral Ceremony. There was
antiently a peculiar Space of Time allotted for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
the Deceased, which they call'd <hi>the Days
of Mourning,</hi> Gen. 27. 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 50. 4. Thus the
Egyptians, who reverenced the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> as
a Prince and a Great Man, lamented his Death
<hi>threescore and ten Days,</hi> Gen. 50. 3. which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by what<note n="1" place="bottom">Lib. I.</note> 
                        <hi>Diodorus</hi> the Sicilian saith, that
the Egyptians mourned for their Kings, when they
died, seventy two Days: wherein he is either
guilty of a small Mistake of the Number, or those
People afterwards added two Days more to the
Time of Mourning. But it must needs be an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
in<note n="2" place="bottom">De Bel. Jud. I. 3. c. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Iosephus,</hi> when he saith, the Time of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Mourning among the Egyptians was forty
Days. Which Mistake perhaps was grounded on
what is said in the preceding Words of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
Place, <hi>forty Days were fulfilled for the embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
so that it is likely he mistook the time of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming</hi>
or making Preparations in order to the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
for the time of <hi>Mourning,</hi> which was distinct
from that, and was seventy Days. The <hi>Hebrews</hi>
Term of Condoleance was far short of this, for
<hi>Ioseph</hi> mourned for his Father but <hi>seven Days,</hi> Gen.
50. 10. And generally afterwards the Funeral
Mourning was confined within a Week both among
the <hi>Iews,</hi> 1 Sam. 31. 13. and the <hi>Arabians,</hi> Job 2.
13. Thus the Time of <hi>Mourning</hi> was Proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to that of <hi>Feasting,</hi> which (as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served)
lasted seven Days. Yet at some Times,
and for extraordinary Reasons, it was lengthned
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:46315:601"/>
out to a much longer Season: thus they mourned
for the Death of <hi>Aaron thirty days,</hi> Numb. 20. 29.
and so long a Time they lamented the Death of
<hi>Moses,</hi> Deut. 34. 8. And this particular Period
of Funeral Lamentation is mention'd in <hi>Deut.</hi>

                     <p>Mourning at Funerals was heretofore help'd and
advanced by <hi>Musick,</hi> and that both of Voice and

the <gap reason="foreign">

Houses of those who were deceased, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 23. For
this Musick was used before the Dead were carried
forth to Burial, but chiefly at the time of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
That this Custom was received among the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> is clear from that of <hi>Ovid,</hi>

as is deducible from <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 17. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is observable that after the Burial of the
Dead, a <hi>Supper</hi> was wont to be made: a Feast of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing
succeeded the mournful Exequies. Thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Abner</hi>'s Funerals were over, <hi>all the People follow'd,</hi>
or <hi>came to David</hi> (who was the Chief Mourner that

Funeral Banquet) <hi>to eat Meat with him,</hi> 2 Sam. 3.
35. Of this Feasting and Rejoicing after the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial

it <hi>Cos Tanchumim, the Cup of Consolation, which they

they took to comfort and refresh them when their

no Man can be backward to think that this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

This <hi>Eben Gedolah</hi> (for <hi>Eben</hi> is of the femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) this <hi>Great-stone</hi> was mention'd before in <hi>v.</hi> 15. and here in this it is call'd <hi>Abel Hagedolah,</hi> the
word <hi>Stone</hi> being here understood; or else the <hi>Stone</hi>
is call'd <hi>Abel</hi> because it was his Memorial, as we call
Statues and Pictures by the Names of those who are
represented by them. If then I should assert that
this is the <hi>Tomb-stone</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> erected in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of his murder'd Son <hi>Abel,</hi> and so was the first
Funeral Monument in the World, I am sure there
is none can disprove it. But because there is no
certainty of this, and it may be <hi>Abel</hi> in this Place
is no more than <hi>Ebel, luctus,</hi> (as that Hebrew Word
signifies) and so relates to the remarkable Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Mourning</hi> which we read of <hi>v.</hi> 19. therefore
I shall dismiss it, and propound that which is plain,
certain and undeniable. Such is <hi>Iacob</hi>'s setting a
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:46315:603"/>
                        <hi>Pillar on Rachel's Grave,</hi> Gen. 35. 20. He that
had set up a Stone for a <hi>Pillar</hi> as a Memorial of the
Covenant made between <hi>Laban</hi> and him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.
45, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and had at other times done the same upon
Religious and Devout Occasions, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 18, 22.
&amp; 31. 45. erects here another <hi>Pillar</hi> as a <hi>Monument</hi>
for his beloved <hi>Rachel,</hi> a visible Remembrance of
that Vertuous Woman, and also a Testimony of
his own Kindness and Love to her. This was
known by the Name of <hi>Rachel</hi>'s <hi>Sepulcher,</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
till the latter End (and 'tis likely a long Time
after) of <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Days, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 2. that is, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
seven hundred Years from the first erection
of it. Among the first and Antient <hi>Tombs,</hi> or <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numental
Sepulchers,</hi> we must reckon those that are
said in Scripture to be composed of <hi>great Heaps of
Stones.</hi> Such is that in <hi>Iosh. 7. 26. They raised over
him</hi> (i. e. <hi>Achan) a great heap of Stones,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
<hi>unto this Day.</hi> And the like Monument had
the King of <hi>Ai,</hi> Josh. 8. 29. <hi>They took his Carease
down from the Tree, and cast it at the entring of the
Gate of the City,</hi> (there interring it, a little without
the City) <hi>and raised thereon a great heap of Stones,
that remaineth unto this Day.</hi> And a Sepulchral
Structure of the very same Sort was set over the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of <hi>Absalom, They took him and cast him into a
great Pit in the Wood, and laid a very great heap of
Stones upon him,</hi> 1 Sam. 18. 17.</p>
                     <p>From which three Instances I observe, 1. That
this sort of Monument was made for those whose
Deaths were untimely and violent. Whence we
might be apt to infer that these were Monuments
of Infamy: and accordingly the Heap of Stones
laid over <hi>Achan</hi> and his Sons, is call'd by <hi>Iosephus,</hi>
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. But, we are not certain that this
particular kind of Monuments was appropriated to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46315:603"/>
this Rank of Persons. It might have been erected
for the Good and Vertuous as well as others, tho
the Scripture affords us no Examples of the former.
2. I observe here the Nature of these <hi>Old Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and that as to these two things; first, this
great <hi>Mass</hi> of Stones was not meerly to cover the
dead Bodies, (for from the foregoing Instances
we find that they were buried in the Earth before)
there was an Edi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ice erected over them, which
was built of these Stones, to be a lasting Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
to Posterity. This <hi>great heap of Stones</hi> was
not confusedly cast upon them, but laid in some
kind of Order by and upon one another: so that this
was a <hi>Fabrick,</hi> such as it was. This I gather from
the Hebrew Words <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which we
find used in the forenamed Texts, and which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
<hi>to raise, set up, erect:</hi> wherefore these Stones
were not cast or thrown upon, or laid over the
dead Bodies disorderly, but were a real Building.
But secondly, we may gather from their being
call'd <hi>a great heap of Stones,</hi> that they were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed
with any Curiosity or Skill, they were set
up without hewing, shaping, polishing. This
sort of Inartificial Building was sometimes without
any <hi>Cement</hi> at ali, at other times with a Careless
Use of it, but such as render'd the Pile firm, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
and durable; otherwise it could not have last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so long a Time as we have heard it did. This
is the Notion that I form of these <hi>first Rude Sepul: chers:</hi>
and you see that the Terms in which they
are exprel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s'd are a Confirmation of it. These let
us know that they were an Edifice, but very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condite
and Artless: which could not be more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
express'd to us than by <hi>raising a great heap of
Stones.</hi> And indeed this was the old Way of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombing
Great Men and Heroes among the <hi>Gentiles:</hi>
                        <pb n="282" facs="tcp:46315:604"/>
they heap'd up great and massy Stones upon one
another, and seem'd as it were to frame a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
rather than a Monument, according to that of
the Poet,
<q>
                           <note n="1" place="bottom">Lucan. Lib. 8.</note> Et regum cineres extructo monte quiescunt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Such a Monstrous Pile I take <hi>Stone-heng</hi> on <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
Plains</hi> to be, which without doubt is a very
Antient Piece. I look upon it as a <hi>Sepulchral Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument</hi>
of the primitive Order and Fashion, such
as those I have been speaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> an Indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
Artless, Formless Tomb. This Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
I prefer before any of the others which Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have publish'd concerning this Antique Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
Some think they give a true Account of
it when they tell us that it was made of Heaps of
Sand and some Unctuous Matter that lay in that
Part of the Plains, and by means of these two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporating
together this Pile of Stones was made.
Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> mentions this, and seems partly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of it, but the Examples which he produces
to confirm it are not of the like Nature, but far
different. And truly though we should suppose
some such unwonted (though natural) Coagmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Sand and Gravel, yet what sober Man
can imagine such High Heaps or Mountains of
them in that Spot of Ground, and no where else?
This therefore looks a little too Romantick. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
would perswade us that it is a <hi>Sea-Concretion,</hi>
and to this Purpose they suppose that these Plains
were once part of the Sea; but this is as Chimeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
a Notion as the other, because of the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this Place from the Sea, and because the
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46315:604"/>
shape of these Stones seems not to be natural but
factitious. Others think it was no Work of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but of Art: these affirm it to be a <hi>Temple</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
1. of the <hi>Tuscan Order</hi> (as<note n="1" place="bottom">Inigo Jones <hi>in his</hi> Stone-heng Restored.</note> One not unskill'd
in Architecture suggests) and dedicated to <hi>Coelus,</hi>
and therefore is without a Roof. He thinks it was
built by the <hi>Romans</hi> when they were Masters of this
Countrey. But supposing this was a <hi>Roman Temple</hi>
without a <hi>Roof,</hi> yet who can believe that it was
without <hi>Walls</hi> and <hi>Foundation?</hi> But such we must
fancy this to be, for neither of these can be found
here: wherefore there is no reason to believe that
it was a Building of that kind. Or 2. it was (as
<note n="2" place="bottom">
                           <hi>See</hi> Spelman.</note> others think) <hi>a Temple of Herthus</hi> or <hi>Hertha,</hi> a God
or Goddess of the Old Germans, and consequently
of the Saxons our Ancestors here in <hi>Britain,</hi> who
call'd this Deity <hi>Earth,</hi> the same with <hi>Vesta</hi> and
<hi>Terra</hi> among the Romans. But what I said before
will serve to confute this groundless Conjecture.
Only here observe how far distant the Opinions of
Writers are about it: some will have it to be a
Place dedicated to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and others to the <hi>Earth.</hi>
Or 3. (as<note n="3" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Spencer de Leg. Hebr. l. 2. c. 6.</note> another surmises) this Structure was
in imitation of those Temples of old among the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi>
which were wont to be built of unpolish'd
Stone, and without Art, because these were
thought to be most acceptable to the Gods. Of
which he saith there were many Instances, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
none; for instead of <hi>Temples</hi> he mentions
<hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>Statues</hi> made after this Fashion, as those
sacred to <hi>Diana</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> spoken of by <hi>Herodian,</hi>
and the Statue of <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Arnobius.</hi> But 'tis enough
here to recur to my former Answer, which 'tis
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46315:605"/>
impossible to evade, <hi>viz.</hi> that here are no Marks
or Footsteps of such a Building as a <hi>Temple.</hi> Or, if
you should say that there were of old, but are
now missing, it is spoken without Proof, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we need not attend to it: and besides, you must
tell us why all is not missing as well as some. These
are the Absurdities wherewith those Authors are
press'd who hold <hi>Stone-heng</hi> to have been a <hi>Temple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But those in my Judgment are in the right, and
are clogg'd with no such Inconveniences, who
hold this Great Amassment of Stones to be a <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Monument</hi>
in remembrance of some eminent
Persons laid there. The particular Occasion is
not well known, though the Common Opinion is
that this Pile was erected in Memory of the British
Lords perfidiously murder'd by the Saxons here,
upon an Interview in King <hi>Vortimer</hi>'s Reign: for
they tell us that <hi>Aurelius Ambrosius,</hi> a Roman by
Birth, but a great Lover of the Britains, came
over soon after this inhumane Slaughter to rescue
them from the Insolency of the Saxons, and then
he erected this Monument in the Place where those
treacherous Villains slew the British Nobility, and
interr'd them. Others say it was erected in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of <hi>Ambrosius</hi> himself, who expired in this
Plain, where he so valiantly fought against the
tyrannizing Saxons. But neither of these Opinions
have any sure Fonndation. The latter is rendred
very improbable by the Reasons which <hi>Iones</hi> hath
offer'd. Nor is the former (which prevails most)
attested by Authors of very good Credit, unless
we reckon <hi>Geoffery Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> (the
chiefest Writers that speak of this Structure) to
be such. Whereupon our<note n="1" place="bottom">Cambden, <hi>in</hi> Britanniâ.</note> Judicious Antiquary
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46315:605"/>
deplores this Unhappiness, that the Founders and
Authors of this Wonderful Structure are utterly
forgotten. Perhaps it was set up in Honour of
<hi>Boadicia</hi> a famous British Queen, who was kill'd
with fourscore thousand in a Batttel against the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
and Britains Romaniz'd, in <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign.
This is the Conjecture of the Author of the <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
call'd <hi>New Caesar.</hi> But neither is this founded on
any sure Basis: though 'tis true he quotes <hi>Dio</hi> and
<hi>Xiphilin</hi> who say she was bur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed very Magnificently
by the Britains. Dr. <hi>Charlton</hi> (who hath writ
against <hi>Iones</hi>) saith this Fabrick was erected in the
Reign of King <hi>Alfred</hi> by the Danes, who at that
time domineer'd in the West of <hi>England:</hi> But I do
not find that this Learned Man offers any convincing
Proof of this, I rather think that this Ragged
Pile was of much antienter Date: and that is the
Reason why we have no certain notice of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Occasion of it.</p>
                     <p>But notwithstanding this Obscurity, we have good
reason to assert that it is an <hi>Old Funeral Monument</hi>
made after the first and antient Fashion, <hi>i. e.</hi> Rude,
Unpolish'd, Artles. Nay indeed, it seems to be
a <hi>Triple Monument,</hi> for it is composed of three divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Stones at some distance from one another,
and the <hi>Ditch</hi> or <hi>Pit</hi> in which they are situated, is
the particular Place where the dead Bodies (for
whose Sake this Memorial was erected) were laid.
Not but that in other adjacent Places there were
other Bodies deposited, and hence it is that Mens
Bones have been dug up here, as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us: which is a farther Proof that this part of
the Plains was a Place of <hi>Burial,</hi> and that this
Great <hi>Stone-Pile</hi> hath relation to that, <hi>i. e.</hi> that it is
a <hi>Sepulcher,</hi> and not a <hi>Temple.</hi> Nay, I could add that
it is probable a great part of this spacious Plain was
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46315:606"/>
on occasion of some famous Slaughter turn'd into
a <hi>Burying-Place,</hi> and not only Tombs of <hi>Stone</hi> were
set up for the most Eminent Persons that lost their
Lives, but others of <hi>Clods</hi> were raised for those
of an inferiour Degree: for there are many of
these <hi>Turf-Monuments</hi> on <hi>Salisbury-Plain,</hi> which the
neighbouring Inhabitants call <hi>Berries, Barrows,</hi> or
<hi>Burrows,</hi> (whence perhaps the Towns fenced here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
with Walls of Turf or Clods of Earth were
call'd <hi>Burrows</hi> or <hi>Boroughs</hi>) which have their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
from the Saxon <hi>Byring</hi> or <hi>Buriging</hi> or
<hi>Boroging,</hi> which we now call <hi>Burying,</hi> because the
way of Interring dead Bodies among many of
the Antients (and among the <hi>Saxons</hi> themselves,
with whom <hi>Beorg,</hi> the Original of the foregoing
Words, signified an <hi>heap of Earth</hi>) was not in deep
Graves, but under Clods or Turfs of Earth made
into Hillocks.</p>
                     <p>As to the fastning and joining together these
Stones which we are speaking of, though this
hath perplexed some Mens Minds heretofore it
seems, and occasion'd them to report that they were
transported whole from <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>Merlin</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment,
(as 'tis not unusual with the Vulgar,
when they cannot give an Account of a Thing,
to ascribe it to the Devil, or some Magick Art) I
am not very solicitous to solve the manner of it:
but this sufficeth me, that 1. It was usual among
the Old Romans (as all skilful and knowing Men
in Architecture confess) to lay great and vast Stones
together by <hi>Tenons</hi> and <hi>Mortises</hi> without Morter.
And so it may be here, (which may induce us to
think it was a <hi>Roman</hi> Structure) and therefore in
vain do we endeavour to find where they are join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and fastned together. 2. I am satisfied that
they had of old ways of <hi>Cementing</hi> Stones which
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46315:606"/>
are not known or practis'd at this Day: and
they had an Art of making the Cement after
that manner that it could not be distinguish'd from
the Stones themselves which it joined together. <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
speaks of <hi>Cisterns</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> made of a sort of dug
Sand and strong Lime, which could not be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
from Stone. It is not unlikely then that
there was here used a kind of Morter that hardned
into Stone, and became of the same Consistency with
it. Nor is it improbable that this petrified Coag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
turn'd into the same Colour with the
Stones which it joined together; and then how can
we expect to discern the Difference between them?
and then why should it be thought strange that they
seem to be all of a Piece? Which puts me in mind
of the <hi>Name</hi> which this Stony Fabrick is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known by, an Account of which I will give
somewhat different from what is usually received.
If I should propound this Etymology, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>Stone-heng</hi> is so call'd from the <hi>Stones</hi> which <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brosius</hi>
is thought to have erected here, and from
<hi>Hengist</hi> the Leader of the Saxons, at whose giving
the Word they pull'd out their Seaxes and kill'd
the British Nobles, so that <hi>Stone-heng</hi> is as much as
<hi>Hengist-stone,</hi> (as this Countrey of <hi>Britain</hi> was by
the Saxons call'd <hi>Hengist-land,</hi> as some Writers

Fabrick <hi>hanging</hi> as 'twere in the Air, whence he

Account of the Name. But in my opinion, and
according to what I have already hinted, the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
simplest and most genuine Derivation of the
Word is from the <hi>Stones hanging</hi> (not in the Air,

that the Scripture gives us the True Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of things, and consequently the Antientest
learning is stored up in this Sacred Volume. I
have largely shew'd that here is the first commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

of things though they be but mean and
contemptible, to shew that no sort of Learning
and Knowledg is useless. Thus it is said, <hi>This is

                        </gap>s the Man (and let him be known to Posterity) that
not by chance; but purposely and designedly, <hi>found</hi>
this new way of <hi>Procreation,</hi> and thereby produced

                        </gap> new Species of Animals. Some <hi>Iewish</hi> Writers
have thought this <hi>Iemim</hi> was a Plant, but there is

meeting of them, but this is very flat. I
hold therefore to the plain Interpretation of the
pure Hebrew Text, which tells us that <hi>Anab found
the Mules,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> he caused the first Engendring
of Horses and She-Asses together, whence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

for so the <hi>Seventy</hi> Interpreters express his Name.
But this is the thing that I observe at present, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>
the Sacred History takes notice even of small Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences,
and thereby lets us see that it is very
full and particular in giving an Account of the first
Inventions of things. It is true, other Authors
have attempted to discover this, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

Founders of them. <hi>Herodotus, Diodorus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

give us some light into these things, but it is dark
in respect of the clear Discoveries in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.
Out of these foresaid Writers <hi>Poly done
Virgil</hi> hath given us a pitiful short Account of the
Inventers of Arts, and other useful things among
Men. <hi>Saturn, Ceres, Pallas,</hi> and other Gods and
Goddesses among the Pagans are assigned the first
Founders of them. All this is feigned Antiquity,
unless so far as it hath some reference to the Holy
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46315:608"/>
Scriptures, and under those disguised Names points
at the Persons who are mention'd in this Inspired
Book. Hence, and from no other Writings, the
first Original of things is to be had: and it must
needs be so, because all the best and antientest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have borrow'd from the Old Testament. It
is granted that Arts and Professions received their
<hi>Improvement</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> afterwards, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we cannot expect that these should be found in
Scripture; but the <hi>first Rise</hi> of them was among
the early Posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the first mention of them is found here, and
no where else. Some of these are but little and
mean things, I know, but yet 'tis certain they are
as great as the Greatest Criticks take notice of
sometimes, and spend much time about in Other
Authors. This moreover is to be said, that here
we are Certain of what we read, we are Sure the
thing is so, which we are not in Other Writers.</p>
                     <p>But before I speak of that, let me insist a little
upon This, that it is a singular Commendation of
the Authors and Penmen of the Old Testament,
but especially of <hi>Moses,</hi> that, being the First Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
they borrow from none, but Other Writers
are beholden to them. It may be observ'd, that
Writers in all Faculties have shewed themselves not
backward in imitating others that writ before
them, or, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> terms, of Filching from them.
This we may see in the <hi>Poets,</hi> all the <hi>Greek</hi> ones
take many things out of <hi>Homer,</hi> and he himself
was a Filcher no less than they, for you may descry

                        <hi>Trojan War.</hi> Nay, <hi>Suidas</hi> tells us, that he took a
great part of his Poem form <hi>Corinnus</hi> a Trojan Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
Scholar of <hi>Palamedes.</hi> And as for <hi>Aristophanes,</hi>
he borrows much from <hi>Euripides,</hi> as an observant
Eye cannot but take notice. As for the <hi>Latin</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,
they have particular Authors in whose Steps
they tread. <hi>Virgil</hi> in his <hi>Eclogues</hi> and <hi>Bucolicks</hi>
strives to resemble <hi>Theocritus,</hi> in his <hi>Goorgicks Hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od</hi>
and <hi>Aratus,</hi> and in his <hi>Aeneids Homer. Horace</hi>
writes in imitation of the <hi>Greek Lyricks,</hi> and the
he calls these <hi>Imitators servum pecus,</hi> yet he is pleas'd
to follow <hi>Anacreon,</hi> and especially <hi>Pindar: Plau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

and <hi>Tcrence</hi> are Emulators of <hi>Epicharmus</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander.</hi>
In brief, <hi>AElian</hi> and others look upon all
Poets after <hi>Homer</hi> to be but his Apes. Amongst
<hi>Orators</hi> the chiefest of them think fit to borrow or
steal from one another, as <hi>Tully</hi> from <hi>Demosthenes,</hi>
and he from <hi>Pericles,</hi> and this last from <hi>Pisistratus.</hi>
In <hi>Philosophy</hi> it were easy to observe the same, and

Among the <hi>Historians</hi> there is the same
Trade carried on: <hi>Iustin</hi> is a downright Plagiary,
taking all from <hi>Trogus Pompeius. Apion</hi> transcribes
many entire Sentences and other considerable Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
out of <hi>Polybius, Plutarch,</hi> and others, and
takes no notice of their belonging to those Persons,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:46315:609"/>
but sets them down as his own: for which Reason
he is stiled by <hi>Scaliger, alienorum laborum fucus,</hi> a
Drone that lived upon others Labours. <hi>Solinus</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
transcribes <hi>Pliny,</hi> his <hi>Polyhistor</hi> is but a Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

acknowledgeth that he gather'd his Book out
of a great Number of Authors Greek and Latin.
So in Ecclesiastical History, <hi>Eusebius</hi> took all or most
of <hi>Iulius Africanus</hi> (an Excellent Writer, and the
first Christian Chronologer) his Book <hi>de Tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>
into his <hi>Chronicon.</hi> In Canon Law <hi>Balsamon</hi> all

him very largely. If we should descend to Modern
Writers (and those very excellent ones too) we
may espy the same thing practised by them. <hi>Tasso</hi>
is beholden to <hi>Virgil</hi> for much of his Model and
Characters. <hi>Galatinus</hi> stole all from <hi>Porchetus,</hi> a
Franciscan from a Carthusian Monk. <hi>Isidore Clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
transcribes whole Pages out of <hi>Sebastian Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi>
and we know of a Learned <hi>English Paraphrast</hi>

that Bishop <hi>Walton</hi> stole from him his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyglotts.</hi>
Thus the best Authors are beholden to
one another: and indeed there is very good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it sometimes, and you cannot expect it
should be otherwise; for they find it requisite to
borrow of those who have treated of the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
both because they have said those things
which cannot be omitted on the Subject, and also
sometimes because they are naturally inclined to

                     <p>But we are speaking now of a Book and of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
where nothing of this nature can happen, for
the <hi>Old Testament</hi> (which is the Writings we speak
of) was, as to a great part of it, extant before
there were any Writers in the World, and so it
was utterly impossible to borrow from Others
This is the Peculiar Excellency of this Book, this
is the Particular Commendation of these Writings
that they were the First of all, and could not be
taken from any else. These Holy Scriptures bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
from none, unless you will say they do so from
Themselves; as the <hi>18th</hi> Psalm is taken out of
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. or this out of that. The Evangelists
borrow from one another. The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>'s
<hi>Magnificat</hi> refers in several Places of it to <hi>Hannab</hi>'s
<hi>Song,</hi> 1 Sam. 2, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes some things out
of his Epistle to the <hi>Epbesians,</hi> and puts them into
that which he wrote to the <hi>Colossians;</hi> and so st.
<hi>Iude</hi> may be said to borrow from St. <hi>Peter:</hi> but
this is not the Plagiarism which Other Writers are
guilty of, and which is an Argument of their
Wants and Defects, whereas the Holy Spirit sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the Penmen of the Bible both with Matter
and Words. In the <hi>Old Testament</hi> especially, and
more particularly in the <hi>Books of Moses,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at second hand: all is fresh and new; th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

things there spoken of were never delivered by any
Writer before. But most of the Profane Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
began when the Holy History was just ending.

and most of the Roman History takes not
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46315:610"/>
its Rise so high. Indeed the Egyptians boasted
that they had been ruled by Kings above ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Years, (as <hi>Herodotus</hi> relates) and thence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it was that one of their <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s (which was
the common Name of all their Kings) bragg'd
that <hi>he was the Son of antient Kings,</hi> Isa. 19. 11. The
Chinoises pretend to give an Account of Passages
almost three thousand Years before Christ: and we
are told by <hi>Martinius</hi> (in his <hi>Atlas</hi>) that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a continued History, compiled from their
Annual Exploits, of four thousand and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years: yea they have (if we may credit the

But these high Flights are exploded by all Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Men, and upon a View of whatever Pretences
are made by Others, they conclude that <hi>Moses</hi> was
the Antientest Writer, and that the earliest Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of Transactions and Occurrences in the
World is to be learnt from him alone. Some of
the Wisest Pagans had a hint of this, and travell'd
into the Eastern Countries to acquaint themselves
with these Records. And it was observ'd long
since by <hi>Plato,</hi> (as I took notice before) that the
Oldest and most Barbarous Tongues (meaning the
Hebrew and Chaldee) were very requisite for the
finding out the first Beginnings of things: for the
first Names of them, which are now grown obso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete

they being the antientest of all. In the

any Truth and Certainty.</p>
                     <p>And as there is the <hi>Antientest Learning,</hi> so there
is <hi>All Learning</hi> (I speak now of that which is <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
and is reckon'd the Accomplishment of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Persons) and <hi>all the kinds</hi> of it in this Book of

Here are things <hi>Profound</hi> and <hi>Mystical,</hi> and here

Hacatub,</hi> (as the Jews rightly call'd it by way
of Eminence) the most Excellent Writings in the
World, fraught with all manner of useful Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
we may afford to be without the other: for
this is a certain Verity, that if we have the <hi>Bible</hi>
we want no Book.</p>
                     <p>And more particularly I have made it appear,
that the Choicest <hi>Antiquities</hi> are to be found here.
A prying Antiquary may find more Work, and
much more to his Advantage, in the Writings of
the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> especially of the Five Books of
<hi>Moses,</hi> than in all the Mouldy Manuscripts and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
in the whole World besides. Therefore you
will find Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (as Great an Antiquary as this
last Age afforded) continually conversing with
these Sacred Records, and presenting the World
with the Noblest and most Useful Pieces of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
from thence. Here we learn what they did
in the Primitive Age of the World, how things
went before and immediately after the Flood. The
Scriptures give the Oldest Account and Discovery
of things. All Curious Observations of the First
Times, all Antient Notions and Inventions are to
be met with here. So that if you look upon the
Bible but as an Antient Book of Learning, we are
invited to study it. We are furnish'd here with
some of the most desirable Antiquities of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,
Persians, Egyptians, Arabians, Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Canaanites, Phoenicians, Jews, Greeks, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
and several other Nations. On which very
Account alone the Bible is the best Book that a
true Lover of Learning can take into his hand.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46315:612"/>
Briefly, from the whole I make this Conclusion,
that no Man can be a Consummate Scholar without
reading the Scriptures, which are the Source even
of all Humane Learning.</p>
                     <p>But as the <hi>Antiquity</hi> and the <hi>Vniversal Learning</hi>
contain'd in this Book, so the <hi>Certainty</hi> of it gives
it the preference to all others. What we meet
with here, we are sure is true: whatever is related
as said or done in so many Ages past, we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to yield a full Assent to, because the Penmen
of this Book were divinely inspired, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not err in what they deliver'd. This
we cannot say of any other Writers, for we find
them to be uncertain and lubricous, and they too
often take up Stories on trust, or invent them as
they please. As for the Writings of the <hi>Poets,</hi>
the best of them are mere Fictions. Yea, One
that knew the Nature of an <hi>Heroick Poem</hi> very well,
tells us that <hi>Fable</hi> is the chief thing in it, it is the

Writers (as <hi>Orpheus, Hesiod,</hi> &amp;c.) are fabulous
Rhapsodists. Even the Father of Latin Poetry,
whom I just now mention'd, brings <hi>Eneas</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi>
together, though he lived several Ages before
her. And many such Historical Incongruities and
fabulous Inconsistencies the Poets put us off with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of true Relations. Yea, professed <hi>Historians</hi>
are full of Uncertainties and Contradictions every
where. <hi>Xenophon</hi> avers that <hi>Cyrus</hi> the first Persian

cut off and thrown into a Vessel full of Blood.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46315:613"/>
Some tell us that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great died of Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness,
others that he was poisoned. <hi>Hannibal</hi> poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd

procured his Dissolution. The same Writer sets
down the several Opinions concerning the Deaths of
<hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> and makes this Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
that the Deaths of Great Men are uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reported. <hi>Athen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but this is contradicted by others. Some say <hi>Aristotle</hi>
drowned himself in <hi>Euripus,</hi> because he could not find
out the Cause of its ebbing and flowing: others
would perswade us, that he poisoned himself: but
some affirm he died a natural Death. There is scarce
any Philosopher but dies twice or thrice in <hi>Laerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</hi>
Nor is there almost any Life in <hi>Plutarch</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
two or three Deaths, as a<note n="2" place="bottom">Dr. Brown Relig. Med.</note> Learned Man hath

                     <p>To pass to other Historians, from whom we

6. 8, 16. <hi>2dly.</hi> He was stoned in the Temple of
<hi>Nanea,</hi> 2 Mac. 1. 15, 16. <hi>3dly.</hi> He died on the
Mountains by a Fall out of his Chariot, 2 <hi>Mac. 9.
28.</hi> There were different Reports concerning <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s
Death, but the respective Historians are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
in them all: He was killed by one of his
own Souldiers, saith <hi>Socrates;</hi> by a Demon, saith
<hi>Callistus,</hi> who wrote in Verse of the War at that
time with the Persians. It is probable that he died
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:46315:613"/>
by a Stroke which a Christian Souldier gave him,
according to <hi>Sozomen:</hi> but none knows whence
that Stroke came, according to <hi>Theodoret. Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
and <hi>Zosimus</hi> speak diversly concerning the Life
and Death of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great. <hi>Procopius</hi>
gives an Account of <hi>Iustinian</hi> contrary to what all
other Historians do. And before this we find the
<hi>Fathers</hi> differing about the Character of <hi>Nicolas the
Deacon: Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> say
he lived a chaste Life, but that being reprimanded
by the Apostles for his Jealousy towards his Wife,
he thereupon brought her out, and exposed her to
any one. But <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> affirm, that
he allowed of and practised all Obscenity and Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the promiscuous Use of Women. The
Person who goes under the Name of St. <hi>George,</hi>
was a <hi>Cappadocian Tribune,</hi> a great <hi>Hero,</hi> and at
last a <hi>Martyr,</hi> say some: he was an <hi>Heretick,</hi> an
<hi>Arian Bishop of Alexandria,</hi> say others: there was
no such Man, say a third sort. If we should look
into our own <hi>British</hi> Concerns, there we shall find
History very dark and uncertain, nothing is tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
related of this Country till <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>'s
time: and then and afterwards we are involv'd in
great Uncertainties, and we can look no where but
things are diversly reported. Great Men die se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Deaths, and the Lives and Actions of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are variously represented. King <hi>Edward,</hi> sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
<hi>Ironsides,</hi> his Death is four or five ways re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
in our Chronicles, and so is King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s.
Some Writers tell us that King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second
died of Famine by Force; others, that he volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
famish'd himself. Some say he was kill'd with
the Blow of a Poll-Ax on his Head; others, that
he escaped out of Prison, and led a solitary Life
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and there expired. Concerning King

by others, that he died of a Pleurisy; by
others, that a Palsey and Cramp took away his
Life; and there are others that considently report

                        </gap>
and foreign. All that are conversant in this way
of Study complain, and that justly, of the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Misrepresentations of Passages of all sorts
among Historians, and of our Darkness and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
by reason of these.</p>
                     <p>But no such thing is to be fear'd, or so much as
suspected in the Sacred History, because God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
speaks there: and therefore we have the sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
ground for our Faith that we can desire. There is
no Authority so firm as that which is Divine: there
is no Testimony so strong and valid as that which
is from the Holy Spirit. And such is that of the
Holy Scriptures; and consequently it most justly
challengeth, yea commandeth our Faith and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
This is the singular Pre-eminence and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
which this Book hath above all others,
that the Penmen of it were directed by the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Spirit of God. This alone is sufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
and six us, it being the most stable as well
as the most proper Basis of our Belief, even where
things that are very Improbable are propounded to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46315:614"/>
us to be assented to. Besides, as to the seeming

Historical Part of the Bible, this ought not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us from giving Credit to them. Many Persons
are wont to look upon these Passages and Stories as
Strange and almost Incredible, which they observe
are not sutable to the Manners, Customs, Arts,
and Conversation of the World, as it is <hi>at present,</hi>
and thence they are enclined to think that there
were no such things heretofore. But these Men
do not well consider, nor distinguish between those
times and these, which are exceedingly Different.
And moreover, if they suspend their Belief of some
things which they read in the Old Testament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they see other things now, things of a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Nature, they may as well disbelieve all the
Other Histories of the Antients that are extant,
which yet we see they are very backward to do.
And they have good Reason on their Side, because
the World is not now as it was then, and therefore
we must not expect that the things which we read
of in those times, should be fully conformable and
agreeable to what occurs in these latter Days. For
this Reason a very<note n="1" place="bottom">Dr. Jackson, Vol. 1. Book 1. chap. 11.</note> Solid and Judicious Writer
hath defended the Antient History of the Greeks
and Latins, (whereof whatever is strange is in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi>
and <hi>Pliny</hi>) shewing, that (though some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Narrations, and many gross Mistakes and
Errors are intermingled) the <hi>Strangeness</hi> of some
Passages which we meet with in them, proceeds
from the <hi>Diversity of Times,</hi> the Posture of the
World having much changed since those things
happened. Let us make use of the same Reasoning
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46315:615"/>
in the present case, and when we find several
Strange, Unusual and Surprizing Matters in the
Writings of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> impute this to the
<hi>Antientness</hi> of them, and the great Discrepancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
those Days and these we now live in. If
we do so, there will be no Impediment to our stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Belief of the Truth of them. Nay, if we
weigh things well, we shall see it is ridiculous to
expect that the Guises and Manners of the World
should be the same now that they were 4 or 5000
Years ago: for there must needs be <hi>new things</hi> when
the Numbers of Persons are so vastly increased;
when the Difference of Climes produces such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity
of Dispositions; when Casualty, Necessity,
Industry, Wit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the Occasions of so many
new Occurrences. Let this be remembred and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
thought of, and it will dispel our vain Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Disbelief. Or, if there be any remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the former Consideration will throughly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate
them, <hi>i. e.</hi> if we call to mind the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Scripture,
which is its peculiar Prerogative and Excellency.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>A particular Distribution of the several Books of the
Old Testament. Genesis (the first of them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the four following ones) being written by
Moses, his ample Character or Panegyrick is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tompted,
wherein there is a full Account of his Birth,
Education, Flight from Court, retired Life, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to Egypt, his conducting of the Israelites thence,
his immediate Converse with God in the Mount, his
delivering the Law, his Divine Eloquence, his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and Meekness, his Sufferings, his Miracles,
and his particular Fitness to write these Books. A
Summary of the several Heads contain'd in Genesis:
to which is added a brief but distinct View of the Six
Days Works, wherein is explained the Mosaick
Draught of the Origine of all things, and at the same
time the bold Hypotheses of a late Writer (designed
to confront the First Chapter of the Bible) are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and refuted. The Contents of the Book of Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus:
to which is adjoined a short Comment on the
Ten Plagues of Egypt. A Rehearsal of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Particulars treated of in Leviticus, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
Deuteronomy. That Moses was the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and Author of the Pentateuch, notwithstanding
what some have lately objected against it.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>To demonstrate yet further the Excellency
of these Holy Writings I will enter upon
the <hi>Third way of Proof</hi> which I proposed;
that is, I will give you a Particular Account of
the several Books contained in the Old and New
Testament, and I will shew all along the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Usefulness and Excellency of them. I begin
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46315:616"/>
first with the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> which is divided by
the Jews into three general Parts; first <hi>Torah</hi> the
<hi>Law,</hi> which contains the five Books of <hi>Moses;</hi> then
<hi>Nebiim</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which comprehends the Books
of <hi>Ioshua, Iudges,</hi> first and second Book of <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>
the first and second of <hi>the Kings, Isaiah, Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,
Ezekiel,</hi> the twelve Small Prophets; all
which make the second Volume: then the <hi>Chetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim</hi>
the <hi>Holy Writers,</hi> in which are included the
<hi>Psalms, Proverbs, Iob, Canticles, Ruth, Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah,
Chronicles;</hi> and these made the third Volume. The
Books of this last Rank were written, say the
Jewish Doctors, by the Inspiration of the Spirit,
but the Writers were not admitted into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of <hi>Prophets,</hi> because they had no Vision, but
their Senses remained perfect and entire all the
while: only the Holy Spirit stirr'd them up, and
dictated such and such things to them, which they
writ down. For you must know that the Old Jews
thought nothing to be right <hi>Prophecy</hi> but what was
conveyed in <hi>Dreams</hi> or <hi>Visions.</hi> But though this
be a Rabbinical Conceit, and hereby they strike <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and some others out of the Number of the
<hi>Prophets,</hi> who were the Chief of them; yet the
<hi>Partition of the Old Testament,</hi> as it may be rightly
understood, is not altogether to be rejected, nay
it seems to be allowed of by our Saviour himself,
<hi>Luke</hi> 24. 44. where he tells his Apostles, that <hi>all
things must be fulfilled which were written concerning
him</hi> (in the whole Old Testament, <hi>viz.) in the Law
of</hi> Moses, <hi>and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these last comprising all the other Parts of the
<hi>Hagiographa:</hi> Or you may divide the Books, as
they stand in their order in the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and <hi>Latin
Version,</hi> (and according to them in our <hi>English</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles)
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:46315:616"/>
into these three sorts, Historical, Doctrinal,
and Prophetical. The <hi>Historical</hi> Books are Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of things done, and these are fifteen, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<hi>Genesis</hi> is the first, and <hi>Iob</hi> the last. Or if you
reckon the two Parts of the History of <hi>Samuel,</hi>
and <hi>the Kings,</hi> and those likewise of the <hi>Chronicles</hi>
as distinct Books, then there are eighteen in all.
The <hi>Doctrinal</hi> Books are such as purposely and
wholly instruct us in our Devotion and a Holy Life:
these are four, the <hi>Psalms,</hi> the <hi>Proverbs, Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,</hi>
and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Song.</hi> The <hi>Prophetick</hi> Books are
those which consist chiefly in Predictions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Deliverance of the Church, the Punishment
of its Enemies, and the Coming of Christ in the
Flesh. These were written either by the <hi>Greater
Propbets,</hi> as <hi>Isaiah, Ieremiah, Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

which also appertain the <hi>Lamentations</hi> of <hi>Ieremiah;</hi>
or by the <hi>Lesser,</hi> whereof the first is <hi>Hosea,</hi> and
<hi>Malachi</hi> the last. Having thus given you a <hi>Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution</hi>
of the Several Books, I come now to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Survey of them, the first whereof is</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Genesis,</hi> which together with the other Parts of
the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> was written by <hi>Moses,</hi> who being the
First Writer that we know of extant in the World,
and being every ways so Remarkable and Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Person, I think my self obliged (before I
proceed any further) to present you with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of this Excellent Man, that in what we shall
deliver concerning this One Penman of Scripture,
you may guess how large we might be in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the rest. But because we cannot have
leisure to do so in all the others that follow, I will
offer here a Specimen of it in this First Inspired
Writer, whom we have occasion to mention. He
was born (about the Year of the World 2370)
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> of Hebrew Parents, who presently read
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46315:617"/>
in his Face<note n="1" place="bottom">Acts 7. 20.</note> extraordinary Marks of Divinity, and
therefore were unwilling to discover his Birth to
the Egyptians, that he might not, according to
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Order, be hurried into <hi>Nile,</hi> and there
drowned. However, in this River they resolve to
expose him in an Ark of Bull-rushes, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
both Him and the Care of this Little Vessel in
which he was embarked to the Great Pilot of the
World: And behold, it arrived at a safe Harbour,
and no meaner a Person than the King's Daughter
received the little Passenger into her Embraces, and
caused him to be brought to Court, and bred up as
her own Son. Here he became<note n="2" place="bottom">Ver. 22.</note> 
                        <hi>Learned in all the
Wisdom of the Egyptians,</hi> in all those Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
wherein they used to instruct their Youth,
which they chiefly designed for the Service of their
Country, <hi>viz.</hi> in Arithmetick, Geometry, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
Astronomy; for these were Sciences that
they thought were Natural to Mens Minds, and
were the first things taught not only by the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
but the rest of the <hi>Antients</hi> in their Schools.
Hence it was written in great Letters over the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Plato</hi>'s School, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
None must be admitted into this Place but such as
have been initiated into Geometry, such as have
had a taste of it at least. Therefore this and the
forenamed Arts were termed <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> i. e.
<hi>Learning</hi> or <hi>Discipline,</hi> by way of Eminency. In all
these was this young Courtier brought up, and
skilled in all Philosophical Accomplishments and
the Knowledg of Nature. Besides, he was more
especially instructed in that Abstruse and Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
Knowledg which the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were peculiarly
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:46315:617"/>
Masters of, namely their <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> Cyphers,
their Mystical Symbols and Figures, whereby they
represented the choicest Truths to Mens Minds.
This way of Symbolical Learning furnish'd them
with all kinds of Notions that were serviceable in
the Life of Man, they were taught hence the best
Rules of Morality, the profoundest Maxims in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks,
and the most useful Sentiments in Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
This was the Celebrated <hi>Wisdom of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
in which <hi>Moses</hi> was educated, being sent by
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter to the best Academies and
Schools of Learning, and committed to the best
Tutors, and having moreover the Advantage of
his own Excellent Parts and Quick Ingeny; for he
who was so Eminent as to his Bodily Features and
Proportions, had without doubt as Fair a Soul.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis time now for <hi>Moses</hi> to leave the Court,
and to add to all his other Accomplishments, that of
<hi>Travelling.</hi> And truly he was neceslitated to this,
for the Court could not bear him any longer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
He could not bear it: he every Day more and
more disliked their Manners, contemned their Gay
Follies, laugh'd at their empty Titles, and<note n="1" place="bottom">Heb. 11. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>refused
to be call'd the Son of Pharaoh</hi>'s <hi>Daughter.</hi> He was
now resolv'd to help and assist his oppressed Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
though by that Attempt he should lose the
Favour of the King, and his Royal Patroness, and
with that all Possibility of being Great, yea though
he should incur the Danger of being Miserable above
the degree of his former Happiness:<note n="2" place="bottom">Ver. 25, 26.</note> 
                        <hi>He chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to suffer Affliction with the People of God</hi> (his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Brethren) <hi>than to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin for
a Season</hi> (in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court): <hi>esteeming the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach

Treasures in</hi> Egypt. In pursuance of this<note n="1" place="bottom">Acts 7. 23.</note> 
                        <hi>he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited

groaned under their extreme Bondage and Slavery

saw them suffering wrong, and avenged the Cause of
the Oppressed, and smote the Egyptians.</hi> This made
him taken notice of by the Egyptian Lords and
Taskmasters, who presently went and represented
his Carriage to the Court, and thereupon he was
banished thence for his daring to take the part of
any of those Hebrew Bondslaves.<note n="3" place="bottom">Ver. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>Then fled</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<hi>into the Land of</hi> Midian, and was a Shepherd
there<note n="4" place="bottom">Ver. 23, &amp; 30</note> 
                        <hi>forty Years,</hi> just as many as he had been a
Courtier. This was the sudden Change of his
Condition, and he made it serviceable to the best
Ends. He went out of the World, as it were, to
come into it with the greater Vigour; for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
Life fitted him for Publick Atchievements af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
his Contemplative and Solitary way of
living prepared him for Action, his Low and Mean
Estate was the Forerunner of his being call'd to
an High one. <hi>God bestows not on a Man Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
unless he first makes Trial of him in some Small
thing,</hi> say the Rabbies; and they instance in <hi>Moses</hi>
and <hi>David,</hi> who kept Sheep. Kings were antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                     <p>Accordingly <hi>Moses,</hi> when he had been forty
Years a Shepherd, was appointed by God to feed
<hi>Israel,</hi> and to spend the remaining forty Years in
that Employment. To which purpose he was sent
back by God into <hi>Egypt</hi> to be a Deliverer to that
oppressed People, and to conduct them into the
Promised Land. Being arrived there he delivered
his Message to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and earnestly solicited him
to attend to it, and to obey the Command of the
King of Kings. Which when he (after several
Offers of Compliance) at last refused, <hi>Moses</hi> with
the Israelites<note n="9" place="bottom">Heb. 11. 27.</note> 
                        <hi>forsook</hi> Egypt, <hi>not fearing the Wrath
of the King,</hi> who they knew would soon pursue
them: and this their Valiant and Undaunted Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

                        <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and placed them out of all Danger of the
Egyptians, whom presently after they saw lying
dead upon the Shore. And this was the Man who
was their Constant Leader in the <hi>Wilderness;</hi> here
he is their only Guide, their Counsellor, their
Oracle in all their Difficulties. By his Ardent
Prayers he was wont to avert the Divine Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
when it was lighting on them, and by the
same Fervent Breathings and Cryings he procured
them the Greatest Blessings they desired and stood
in need of. This was the Person that was taken
up by God into the Mount, and had the peculiar
Favour and Honour of conversing most Familiarly
and Intimately with him; and in that had the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieminence
of all the Prophets that ever arose in
<hi>Israel,</hi> for none of them were admitted to that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
Dignity vouchsafed to him, namely,<note n="1" place="bottom">Deut. 34. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>to
know God Face to Face.</hi> He was the Man employed
by God to receive the <hi>Law</hi> for the Jews, which he
delivered to them with great Care and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
often Repeating and Explaining it, shewing
them the Reasonableness, Usefulness and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of those Constitutions and Statutes which were
given them by God, continually teaching them to
understand these Laws aright, and encouraging
them to practise them; insomuch that he hath
gain'd among all Nations the Name of a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi>
far surpassing that of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> among the

                     <p>Of this Admirable Person this short but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive

<pb n="313" facs="tcp:46315:619"/>
he that was <hi>slou of Speech,</hi> and of a slow Tongue
(for which Reason <hi>Aaron</hi> was his<note n="1" place="bottom">V. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Mouth, i. e.</hi> his
Spokesman to the People) was <hi>Mighty in Words.</hi> How
can this be? Very well. A Man may want Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and yet be a Great Orator. <hi>Demosthenes</hi>
had a natural Impediment in his Speech, and so had
<hi>Tully,</hi> and neither of them could quite conquer it
by their Art and Industry. Their Oratory lay
more in the Matter, and their wise framing of it,
than in the Words they spoke. So was it with this
Great Man, (if I may compare him with them) he
was mighty in Words, yet was no Graceful Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
he was Powerful in Speech, yet a Stamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.
This shews that there is a Rhetorick, and that
very Potent, which consists not in Readiness of
Language and Volubility of Words, but in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Great Reason and Excellent Sense, and in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which is to the Purpose. Especially the
the <hi>Words</hi> are <hi>Mighty</hi> when they proceed from an
Excellent <hi>Mind,</hi> and when <hi>Deeds</hi> follow. So that
<hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> may be thought to be a good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator
on St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> for he gives this as part of
<hi>Mose</hi>'s Character, that<note n="2" place="bottom">

                        <hi>he was of a Great Soul,
and very able and powerful in his Life.</hi> He did what
he said, he acted according to what he spoke. The
Israelites were directed to their Duty more by his
Practice, than his Words. He effectually taught
them to live well, chiefly by doing so Himself. He
set them a Pattern of all Vertues imaginable, and
then commended them all by his Exemplary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension
and Humility. Though he was one of
the most transcendent Excellencies, (the Beauties
of Body and Mind shining in him, as you have
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:46315:620"/>
heard) yet he was the Humblest and<note n="1" place="bottom">Num. 12. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Meekest Man
on the Face of the Earth.</hi> He gave an undeniable
Proof of this when<note n="2" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> he refused to contend with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi>
and <hi>Aaron</hi> about his Authority and Eminency,
which God himself had enstated him in, but which
they denied to own. He discover'd this mild Spirit
when he patiently bore all the unworthy Carriage
of the People towards him. They knew well
enough that he left the Egyptian Court and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
for their Sake, that he might be their Leader
and Deliverer: yet they forgot this his singular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to them, and often murmured against him,
and slandered and reviled him, and would have
none of his Conduct, yea and<note n="3" place="bottom">Exod. 17. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>were ready to stone
him</hi> after all his Pains and Care for them. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all these Affronts, and Injuries, and
offers of Violence, (which were almost perpetual)
he went on contentedly in the Discharge of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and forgat their ill Demeanour towards him,
and studied nothing more than to oblige them.
Or, his <hi>being Mighty in Deeds,</hi> may refer to the
Astonishing <hi>Miracles</hi> which he wrought. He out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
all the Prophets in these, say the Jewish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors;
for (if you'l believe their<note n="4" place="bottom">Manasse ben Israel Quaest. in Deuteron.</note> Computation)
there were but seventy four Miracles done by all
of them from the Beginning of the World, till the
Destruction of the first Temple, but <hi>Moses</hi> himself
wrought seventy six Miracles: so that he did more
than all the Prophets together. But this we are
certain of from the infallible Records of Scripture,
that he was Mighty in working of Miracles. The
Sacred History, which he penn'd by the Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Holy Spirit, gives us a Particular of
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:46315:620"/>
some of those Wonderful Things which he effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and at the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and in the <hi>Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
and many others are not mention'd, (as is
usual in these brief Narratives of things) but all
of them were the Operations of a Divine and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Power.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, he was <hi>Mighty in Deeds</hi> relating to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the Management of Publick Affairs
which respect either Peace or War. It was <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>'s
Judgment of old, and after him some Great
Persons liked it so well that they made it theirs
too, that it would never be well with the World
till Philosophers had the Reins of Government
put into their Hands, or till the Governours and
Guides of People were become True Philosophers.
There were notable Examples of this in <hi>Athens,</hi>
where <hi>Aristides, Themistocles, Miltiades, Pericles, Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
Alcibiades,</hi> and several others were as celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Philosphers as Commanders and Captains. They
were renowned for their Great Wit and Judgment,
and for as Great Valour and Conduct. As wife Men
they knew how to regulate themselves and their
own Manners; as skilful Rulers and Governours,
they knew how to rectify the Behaviour of others.
We are sure that <hi>Moses</hi> wanted not this double
Advantage, being versed both in the Principles of
the Best Philosophy, and the Wisest Government,
and being able to act according to both. His Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Contemplation were reduced into Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise:
he by them not only understood but practis'd
the Arts of War and well Governing. He knew
how to give Laws to the People, and knew how
to lead them into the Field: like <hi>Caesar</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
who was both Scholar and Souldier, the
Master of Eloquence and of Arms. The great
Variety of Life which he had gone through made
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:46315:621"/>
him universally Knowing, and sitted him for all
sorts of Actions. <hi>David</hi> is a like Instance in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and I know not another. He was, like <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
a Shepherd, a Courtier, a King's Favourite,
and afterwards out of Favour, a Fugitive, a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
a Ruler, a Prophet, a Writer. This Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Scenes rendered both of them Compleat
Actors: this Diversity of States furnish'd them
with Political Wisdom, which being added to that
which was Divine, enabled them to act so laudably in
those Publick Stations to which they were advanced.
And for this reason our <hi>Moses</hi> is the more Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<hi>Historian,</hi> because he was one of such vast
Knowledg and Wisdom, and had pass'd through so
many and various Stages of Life, and especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was personally engaged in most of the
things he writes.</p>
                     <p>We count it a good Qualification in those that
pen <hi>Histories,</hi> that they write things done in their
own time, and that they bore a Part in what they
describe. Thus <hi>Dictys Cretensis</hi> (if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with him) writ the Trojan War, wherein he
himself had served: <hi>Thucidides</hi> (as he tells us in the
beginning of his History) was present at the things
he wrote concerning the Peloponnesian War, and
saw and knew much of it. <hi>Xenophon</hi> was both Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
and Captain, and knew many of the Things
he transmits to Posterity. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> (as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us in the Entrance of his History) travell'd
a great Part of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> to inform himself
of the Things he relateth, and that he might be
an Eye-witness of most of them: and it appears
from what he saith elsewhere, that he went into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica.
Iulius Caesar</hi>'s <hi>Commentaries</hi> (which Name
he was pleas'd out of Modesty to apply to the best
<hi>History</hi> in the World of that sort) are an Account of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:46315:621"/>
the Military Acts of his own Army. He fought and
writ: his Battels were transcribed into his Book: his
Blood and his Ink were equally free, his Sword and
his Pen were alike famous. <hi>Iosephus</hi> accompanied
<hi>Titus</hi> to the Siege of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and knew himself
the Acts done in the War he writes. <hi>Polybius</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
to most of the Parts which he describes, and
saw those very things which he writes of. <hi>Procopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
sets down what he knew, for he was present
with <hi>Belisarius</hi> at the Wars which he treats of, and
was Eye-witness of what he relates. <hi>Herodian</hi> writ
the History of the Emperors of his own Time,
and so had the exacter Knowledg of their Actions.
<hi>Suetonius</hi> was Contemporary with the three last
Emperors, whose Lives he writes. Among the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Historians, <hi>Comines, Guicciardine, Sleidan, Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi>
are commendable on this account, they lived
at the same time when most of the Things which
they record were done, and they were themselves
actually concern'd in many of them. Now, if
these who were interested in the Matters they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
are thought to be well qualified on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for <hi>Historians,</hi> then we ought to have the
greater Regard to our <hi>Divina Writer,</hi> who was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in so great a Part of the Things which he
commits to Writing. He describes those Battels
at which he was present, and records those Passages
in which he had a Share, and that a very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
one: so that having the Relation of these things
from his Mouth, we do not only read them, but as
'twere see them. And here by the way we may
see the unreasonableness of those Mens Cavils, who
think it a diminishing of the Authority of <hi>Moses</hi>'s
Writings that he so often records his Own Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Deportment, as if they did not sound well,
nay could not be true from his own Mouth. But
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:46315:622"/>
it is certain that this very Thing commends his
Writings, and strengthens the Authority of them,
especially when we know that he was a Person
of Integrity, and would not tell a Lie. We think
not the worse of <hi>Iosephus</hi>'s <hi>Life,</hi> because 'twas writ
with his own Hand; nor of the Emperor <hi>Antoninus</hi>'s
<note n="1" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>Books concerning Himself,</hi> nor of <hi>St. Austin</hi>'s <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions</hi>
wherein he gives an Account of his own
Actions, nor of <hi>Cardan,</hi> or <hi>Iunius,</hi> or <hi>Bp. Hall,</hi>
who writ their Own Lives, nor of <hi>Montaign</hi> who
in one Book more especially makes <hi>Himself</hi> the
Subject, and relates his own Temper, Studies, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And shall we think the worse of <hi>Moses</hi>
because he sets down the Passages of his own Life in
the Books which he hath written? No: this rather
advanceth their Credit among wise and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Men, who are satisfied that none was so
fit to give an account of his own Actions as this
Author himself, both because he knew them better
than any Man, and because he was of that entire
Faithfulness that he would relate nothing but what
was exactly true. And that he was thus faithful
and impartial, is evident from those Passages which
relate to Himself, which are frequent in these
Writings, where his own Infirmities, Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Follies are registred, where his unseemly
Wrath and Passion, where his gross Unbelief and
Distrusting of God (as at the Waters of <hi>Meribah</hi>
especially) and several other Miscarriages of his
Life are set down. This shews that he spared not
Himself, and that he was not guilty of Partiality:
this shews that he was devoted to Truth, and not
led by Applause and Vain Glory. Whereas he
might have composed his own Panegyrick, and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46315:622"/>
transmitted it to future Ages, you see he chose the
contrary, and recorded his own Faults and Misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanours:
whence it is rational to conclude that
he would not falsify in the least in any other Part
of his Writings. And as for that Aphorism of
<hi>Machiavel, He that writes an History must be of no
Religion,</hi> it is here disproved and consuted: <hi>Moses</hi>
was the most Absolute <hi>Historian,</hi> and yet the most
<hi>Religious;</hi> and his being the latter, capacitated him
to be the former. For no Man can so impartially
deliver the Truth as he that speaks it from his own
Breast, and especially (as in the present Case) hath
a practical Sense of those Divine Things which he
delivers. This is that Person who was the Author
of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> that Excellent <hi>Philosopher, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,
Historian,</hi> that Captain, that <hi>Prince,</hi> that
<hi>Prophet,</hi> that <hi>Man of God,</hi> who was the Inspired
Writer of the five first Books of the Bible.</p>
                     <p>The first of which (as I said before) is <hi>Genesis,</hi>
which begins with the History of the <hi>Creation.</hi>
And I call it a <hi>History,</hi> in opposition to the fond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of those Men who read the Beginning of this
Book with <hi>Cabalistick</hi> Spectacles only, and think
there are nothing but Allegories and Mysteries in
the whole Text. But the contrary is very evident
to unprejudiced Minds: and to such as are not so, I
have propounded Arguments in another Place (<hi>viz.</hi>
when I treated of the <hi>Literal</hi> and <hi>Mystical Sense</hi> of
Scripture) to take off their Prejudces and Mistakes.
This I did, because it is necessary to be firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the Truth and Certainty of what we
meet with here in our Entrance into the Bible. It
is indispensably requisite that we believe <hi>Moses</hi> to
have delivered these things as an <hi>Historian;</hi> and
that he speaks real Matter of Fact, when he gives
us a Narrative of the Beginning of all things, and
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:46315:623"/>
particularly of the Original of Man, his Innocency
and Happiness, and after that his Fall, which was
the Source of all Sin, of the Devil's Tyranny, of
Death, of Hell, and of all Evils whatsoever. The
Knowledg and Belief of This are the Basis of all
Religion, and that perhaps was the Meaning of
<note n="1" place="bottom">Colloq. Mensal.</note> 
                        <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Saying,</hi> that the First Chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi>

and sent to subdue the Devil, and to destroy
Sin and Death.</p>
                     <p>But because this First Book begins with the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World,</hi> and is therefore by the Rabbins
call'd <hi>the Book of the Creation,</hi> I will here annex a
brief View of the several Distinct Steps of this
Great Work, as they are represented to us by this
Inspired Writer and Divine Philosopher, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us that there were six Days spent in erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this glorious Fabrick of the World. And this
will be a farther Proof of what I said before, <hi>viz.</hi>
that in Scripture is the <hi>Truest Philosophy.</hi> When
<hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>In the Beginning God created the Heaven
and the Earth,</hi> Ver. 1. he doth in these Words give
us a summary Account of all that he intended to
say afterwards in this Chapter: for <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Earth</hi> comprehend the Whole Creation. This
first Verse then is to be look'd upon as a <hi>General
Draught</hi> of the Production of all things: and the
<hi>Particulars</hi> of it follow in the next Verses, where
the several Days Works are distinctly set down.
The Product of the first Day was two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi>
the <hi>Terraqueous Mass</hi> (call'd here the <hi>Earth</hi>) and
<hi>Light.</hi> There was first of all created a Rude Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Heap, (by Profane Writers call'd the <hi>Chaos)</hi>
an Indigested Mass of Earth and Water mix'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
out of which God afterwards made all
Corporeal things which belong to this lower
World. For we must not (as some) imagine that
the <hi>Celestial</hi> Bodies were composed out of the
<hi>Earthly</hi> Chaos, that all the Vast Spaces of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Mansions owe their Rise to this Mass below,
and that the very Stars were the Offspring of the
Earth. No; <hi>Moses</hi> gives us to understand that this
Confused Lump was the Original only of the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
World: for <hi>the Earth</hi> in this first Verse is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46315:624"/>
as one Part of the new-created World, as
distinct from <hi>Light</hi> the other Part of the Creation.
As <hi>Light</hi> then (of which I shall speak next) was
the Primordial Matter of the <hi>Ethereal, Celestial</hi> and
<hi>Shining</hi> Bodies; so this Gross and Lumpish Heap
was that of which all <hi>Dark</hi> and <hi>Heavy</hi> Bodies were
compounded. This Unshapen Mass <hi>without Form,
and void,</hi> is here, by a general Name, call'd <hi>the
Earth,</hi> though it was not in a strict sense such; for
the <hi>Earth,</hi> as a distinct Body from all others, was
the Work of the third Day. In this Place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by <hi>Earth</hi> is meant Earth and Water blended
together, which made one Great Bog or Universal
Quagmire. This is the plainest and truest Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we can have of the Primitive State of the
World. And hence without doubt was derived
the Opinion of <hi>Thales</hi> and some other Antient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
that <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Slime,</hi> or <hi>Mud,</hi> (for
they express it variously) was the Source of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
whatsoever. And certain it is that this Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raqueous
Matter was the first Origine of all those
material Beings before-mention'd. Accordingly
Sir <hi>W. Raleigh,</hi> in the Beginning of his <hi>History of
the World,</hi> determines, that <hi>the Substance of the
Waters, as mix'd in the Body of the Earth, is by</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<hi>understood in the word Earth.</hi> Hitherto, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Mosaick History,</hi> Nature is in her Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes,
the World is overspread with <hi>Darkness,</hi>
which is especially said to be <hi>on the face of the Deep,</hi>
by which is meant either the whole Disorder'd
Mass, which was an Abyss, or else (as is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
the <hi>Watry</hi> Part of it; for though this and
the <hi>Earthy</hi> Parts were mix'd together, yet these
latter being lightest were generally uppermost,
and floted above all, and appear'd on the Surface of
the Earth. Therefore that Learned Knight before
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46315:624"/>
mention'd observes that the <hi>Earth was not only mix'd
but cover'd with the Waters.</hi> But <hi>the Spirit of God</hi>
(as <hi>Moses</hi> proceeds to tell us.) <hi>maved</hi> or <hi>hover'd over</hi>
this Dark Abyss, this Mix'd Chaos, especially <hi>the
Waters,</hi> (as 'tis particularly said, because these
were uppermost) and hereby the Rude Matter was
prepared to receive its several Forms, and then
the World began to throw off its Dark and Sable
Mantle, and to appear in a Bright Dress.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>other</hi> Product of this first Day (and
which indeed made it <hi>Day</hi>) was <hi>Light, i. e.</hi> some
Lucid Body or Bodies: which yet cast but a Glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering
Splendor, a Faint Radiancy in comparison
of what was afterwards on the fourth Day, when
we are told in what certain Subjects the <hi>Light</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided,
and was as it were fix'd. But now it was
feeble and vagrant, and was the first Result of
some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iry and luminous Matter which the Divine
<hi>Spirit</hi> by his powerful <hi>Moving</hi> and Incubation had
engender'd. This Bright and Glorious Matter
was the <hi>Second</hi> General Source of all Beings, that
is, out of it were made the pure <hi>Aether,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi>
and <hi>Stars,</hi> and whatever belongs to the superiour
Part of the World; but these appertain to the
fourth Day's Work. Now we are only to take
notice of this <hi>Light</hi> as it is here the Catholick
Term for the First Rudiment of the whole <hi>Celestial</hi>
Creation (as <hi>Earth</hi> was the word to express the
First Matter of the Inferiour Part of the World).
And what is this <hi>Light</hi> but <hi>Fire</hi> or <hi>Flame,</hi> that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Matter which heats and enlightens the World?

in a Continual Agitation, and which by their rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Motion and Pressure communicate Warmth and
Light, Vigour and Lustre where-ever there is need
of them in the Universe. Some refer the Creation
of <hi>Angels</hi> to this first Day's Work, by reducing
them to the word <hi>Heaven</hi> in the first Verse; but I
have suggested already that that Verse is a General
Account of the Whole Creation, and not of any
Particular Day's Production, (or else by <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Earth</hi> there is meant the First Matter or Rude
Draught of both) therefore no such thing can be
inferr'd thence. Nor are we to think that the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick Order</hi> is comprehended under <hi>Light,</hi> (as I find
some imagine, because they read of <hi>an Angel of
Light,</hi> 2 Cor. 11. 14.) for it is Material Light only
that is the Product of the first Day's Work. I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
think that <hi>Moses</hi> designed not to include <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi>
in any Part of that Account which he gives of
the Creation, for he makes it his Business to speak
of those Works of God which were visible and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
and therefore 'tis no wonder that the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Spirits are not mention'd, for they come not
within the Compass of his Undertaking.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto we have had a View of the Two Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Materials of all visible Beings in the World,
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. The <hi>Formless Mass</hi> or <hi>Chaos</hi> (whence 'tis
likely <hi>Aristotl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> derived his <hi>First Matter,</hi> which is
according to him neither this nor that, but mere
passive Potentiality, yet susceptive of any Form).
2. <hi>The Active Light,</hi> which was made to envigorate
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:46315:625"/>
the dull and inert Matter of the Chaos, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to be the Original of the Vast Luminaries of
the Celestial Part of the World. These are the
General Elements of the Mundane System; one
gross and unactive, the other subtile and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
the one the Matter of this inferiour Part of
the Universe, the other of those more spacious and
extended Orbs above. This I take to be the true
Account of the <hi>Origine of the World,</hi> though I have
but few (if any) that concur with me in laying it
down thus; for the <hi>Chaos</hi> is generally made the
Universal Source of the World. But to me it
seems to be but One Part of it, and that of this
Lower Division only, which is very small in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the other. I have only this to add here,
that it is this First Day's Work alone that in the
most proper and strict Sense ought to be call'd <hi>the
Creation,</hi> because now was made the First and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Substance out of which the Works of the
other Days were produced; though it is true in a
latitude of speaking, the Formation of the distinct
Species of Beings was a <hi>Creation</hi> also. And of these
I proceed now to speak according to the <hi>Mosaick</hi>
Method, the same with that of the Creator.</p>
                     <p>On the second Day was the <hi>Lower Heaven</hi> or <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament</hi>
made, call'd by this Divine Philosopher
<hi>Rakiang, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Expansion,</hi> or according to the
<hi>Seventy Interpreters</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, whom the <hi>Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
follows, and renders it <hi>Firmamentum.</hi> This
was produced <hi>in the midst of the Waters,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of it was to <hi>divide the Waters from the Waters,
(v. 6.) i. e.</hi> (as it follows) <hi>the Waters under this
Firmament from the Waters above it.</hi> The Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which is, (after all the wild Comments on
these Words) that whereas the Waters at first
were heap'd together very high above the Earth in
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:46315:626"/>
some Places, the All-wise Disposer began this Day
to make a Separation of them, and to frame an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion</hi>
(for that is the simple and downright Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the Hebrew Word) between the lower
and the higher Parts of the Waters: so that now
there was a <hi>Distance</hi> between them, which was
caused by the Interposition of <hi>Air</hi> between these
lower and higher Parts of the Waters. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Creator, by attenuating and rarifying these,
transmuted them into an <hi>Aerial</hi> Body, which shall
always continue so, <hi>i. e.</hi> shall remain really distinct
from the crasser Subsistence of <hi>Water.</hi> Therefore
in plain Terms this <hi>Expansum</hi> is the <hi>Whole Region
of Air:</hi> and we cannot imagine any other <hi>Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi>
or <hi>Out-spread Firmament</hi> which divides the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
from the inferiour Waters, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Clouds</hi>
from that vast Body and Mass of Waters which at
first cover'd the Earth, and soon after (as you shall
hear) were disposed of into particular Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
and were denominated <hi>the Seas.</hi> But yet in
a large way of speaking this <hi>Firmament</hi> here spoken
of is all that <hi>Extended Space</hi> (for that, I say, is the
proper Denotation of the Word) which reacheth
from the Earth to the Place of the Stars, which
was made afterwards. If it be asked why this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Day's Work hath not the same <hi>Approbation</hi>
that the rest have: I answer, the Reason is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>it was not good,</hi> but because it was but an Essay
or Specimen of the two next Days Works; for the
Waters were but now begun to be separated,
which afterwards we find finish'd on the third
Day: and this <hi>Firmament</hi> was but a Beginning or
Preparative to the Production of a higher and
nobler <hi>Expansum</hi> on the fourth Day. This
we may conceive to be the Reason why the
<hi>Epiphonema</hi> which is added to every Day's Work
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:46315:626"/>
[<hi>God saw that it was good</hi>] is not adjoined here.</p>
                     <p>On the third Day there was this fourfold Work;
1. A <hi>Compleat Separating</hi> or dividing of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
2. A <hi>Gathering</hi> of them into one Place,
which was then, and is since call'd <hi>the Sea.</hi> And
it is most reasonable to believe that on the same
Day that the <hi>Seas</hi> were made by depressing some
Parts of the Earth for the Waters to run in, the
Channels also of the <hi>Rivers</hi> were fix'd, and the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of Water let into them. For if (as some
imagine) Rivers were made afterwards by Men,
the Banks of them (or one Side of them at least)
would be higher than the rest of the Ground, by
reason of the Earth dug out and cast up. 3. A
<hi>Drying of the Land,</hi> which was a necessary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of that collecting the Waters into certain
Cavities and Channels in the Earth; for they being
drain'd and sunk down into these, the Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
dry, and had the Denomination of <hi>Earth</hi>
(properly so call'd) given to it. <hi>Virgil</hi> expresses
it thus, (for he as well as other Poets, as I have
shew'd in another Place, borrowed several things
from the Sacred Records)
<q>
                           <l>Et durare solum, &amp; discludere Nerea Ponto</l>
                           <l>Coepit.—</l>
                        </q>
And this was not only in order to render it a suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Habitation for Men and Beasts afterwards, but
to sit it immediately for <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Herbs,</hi> for <hi>Trees</hi>
and <hi>Fruits,</hi> (and more especially for the Plantation
of Paradise) which were the fourth and last Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of this Day.</p>
                     <p>The next Day was employ'd in creating of an
<hi>Etherial Heaven</hi> or <hi>Firmament,</hi> and furnishing it
with Glorious Lights. As the <hi>former</hi> Firmament
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:46315:627"/>
or Expanse was the Space between the Earth and
<hi>Aether,</hi> so <hi>this</hi> is that vast Extension which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
the <hi>Aether,</hi> and all the Luminaries placed
in it, and whatever is above it, even the Place of
the Blessed, call'd <hi>the Heaven of Heavens.</hi> The
Generality of Expositors, I grant, make the other
Firmament and this the same, and think that the
<hi>Firmament</hi> here spoken of is not mention'd as the
Product of this Day's Creation, but that here is
only a new mentioning of the preceding one. But
this Mistake hath run them into great Absurdities,
and hath made them unable to give any tolerable.
Account of the <hi>Waters under the Firmament,</hi> and
those <hi>above it.</hi> But if you quit the usual Road of
Interpreters, and take <hi>the Firmament</hi> in the <hi>14th</hi>
Verse to be different from that in <hi>ver. 6, &amp;</hi> 7. you
solve all Difficulties whatsoever, and the Texts are
clear and evident. Wherefore I distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>the Firmament of Air</hi> and that of <hi>Aether, i. e.</hi>
that wherein the <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Meteors</hi> are, and the
other which contains the <hi>Luminaries</hi> of Heaven.
And you may observe that this, in contradistincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the former, is signally stiled thrice <hi>the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Heaven,</hi> ver. 14, 15, 17. This <hi>Celestial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pansion</hi>
being fix'd, the next Work was to garnish
and adorn it. To which purpose the <hi>Light</hi> made
the first Day is now abundantly and almost infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
augmented and refined, and disposed of into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
particular <hi>Orbs</hi> or <hi>Spheres,</hi> or <hi>Vortices,</hi> which
are form'd in this upper Part of the World. As
all the formerly dispersed Light which was scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
over the whole Face of the Earth and Deep,
was (as we expresly read, <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) <hi>divided from the
Darkness,</hi> whereby one half of the Globe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned,
and the other was in the dark; (it was Day
with one Hemisphere whilest it was Night with the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:46315:627"/>
other) so now on the third Day this Wandring
Light is gather'd into the Bodies of the <hi>Sun</hi> and
<hi>Stars.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the <hi>Mosaick Philosophy</hi> concerning the
<hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Heavens;</hi> and (if it were my Business
here) I could shew that upon true Principles of
Reason it is more consistent than any Philosophical
Hypotheses of another Strain, and especially more
congruous to the Laws of Motion and the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Nature than that of Monsieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi>
who tells us, that there were nothing but Suns and
Stars at first, there were no Earths nor Planets,
but in process of Time some of these Suns were
overspread with Spots and Scum, and became opake,
and being suck'd in by their Neighbour-Vortices,
turn'd into Planets or Earth. But truly, to give
this worthy Person his due, he propounded this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a Handsome <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> a neat Philosophick
Fiction, which he thought might serve as a good
Expedient to solve some Celestial Phaenomena. But
he intended not that any Man should look upon it as
a Reality, and thereby exclude the Mosaick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
For his own Words are these,<note n="1" place="bottom">Non dubium est quin Mundus ab initio fuerit creatus cum omni suâ perfectione, ita ut in co &amp; Sol, &amp;c. Cartes. Princip. Philos. Par. 3. Sect. 45.</note> 
                        <q>It is not
to be doubted that the World was at the very
first created with all its Perfection, so that there
were then existent the Sun, Earth and Moon.
This the Christian Faith teacheth us, and even.
natural Reason perswades us to think so: for
when we attend to the Immense Power of God,
we can't imagine that he ever made a thing
which was not every ways entire and perfect.</q>
Thus he establisheth the <hi>Mosaick</hi> System, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:46315:628"/>
to which the <hi>Earth</hi> was before, not after the
Heavens; yea, as gross as it was, it was the First<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
of the Creation, and consequently the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis
about its being made by Absorption is a Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So according to <hi>Moses</hi> the <hi>Earth</hi> was the Basis
and Foundation of the World, and the <hi>Sun</hi> and
other <hi>Luminaries</hi> were placed in the <hi>Firmament,</hi>
which is said to be <hi>above the Earth;</hi> wherefore the
System that makes the Earth the Center, and not
the Sun, is founded on this.</p>

in the Six Days Works. But he mistook the
System of the World which <hi>Moses</hi> describes, and
thence was his Error. I wish it was not wilful and
presumptuous, for from several bold Strokes in
this Ingenious Man's Writings, one would be apt to
think he enclined to <hi>Alphonsus</hi>'s Humour, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that if he had been at the Creation of the
World, he could have taught God to have formed
the System of it better. But I will retain a more
charitable Opinion concerning this Author. And
I expect that he shoud shew his Charity (as I have
mine) in not censuring this my free Descant upon
what he hath publish'd to the World: for I have as
great a Regard as any Man to True and Sober <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi>

of it; but I must needs protest that I abhor the
Practice of those who exclude the Sacred Writings
whilest they adhere to their own Hypothesis, who
set up such Philosophical Principles and Conclusions
as directly oppose and contradict the Revealed
Truths of the Bible. And this is the Case now
before us, or else I should not have troubled the

                     </p>
                     <p>To proceed; on the <hi>fifth Day</hi> the Inhabitants of
the <hi>Seas,</hi> and of the <hi>Lower Heaven</hi> were form'd.
For though the chearing and warming <hi>Light,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was embodied and gather'd together into
certain Receptacles, was instrumental by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Power to produce <hi>Vegetables,</hi> yet it was not

Animals (as on the foregoing Day all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
belonging to the Sea and Rivers, and to the
Air, were created). And lastly <hi>Mun,</hi> the Top
and Glory of the Creatures, the most Elaborate
Piece of the whole Creation, was framed out of
the Dust; and, in respect of his Diviner Part es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially,
made according to the Image of God
himself. He is too Great and Noble a Being to be
spoken of by the by, and therefore I shall not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of him here. Only I will observe the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness
of the <hi>Archaeologist,</hi> who positively
avers that this last Day's Performance was not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable</hi>
to the rest, and thence condemns the
<hi>Mosaick History</hi> of the Creation. But this Dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
is either in respect of <hi>more</hi> or of <hi>less</hi> done
on this Day than on the others. If he complains
that <hi>more</hi> was done, he shews himself incon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:46315:629"/>
for hereby it appears that he takes no notice
of the Creation's rising higher and higher towards
the latter end; besides that he confines the Creator
himself. But if he complains (as I suppose he doth)
that <hi>less</hi> was done, he shews what low and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Thoughts he hath of <hi>Man:</hi> as if <hi>Mud, Water,
Earth, Clouds, Seas, Plants, Fish</hi> and <hi>Fowl,</hi> (the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
of the former Days) were much better
than Him whom God purposely reserv'd to be the
Complement and Perfection of all, Him to whom
every Creature pays a Tribute, Him for whose
Use and Benefit the whole World was made.</p>

                        </gap>, the Primitive
<hi>Works</hi> of God, and the <hi>Several Days</hi> in which they
were made. For we are not to imagine (as<note n="1" place="bottom">Philo de Allegor. Leg. l. 1. Hilar. de Trin. I. 12. S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin. in Gen. sec. literam.</note> some
do) that this Division of the Creation into so many
Parts is only set down for Order sake, but that
really all was done at once and in a Moment: for
then the Reason given in the Fourth Commandment
of sanctifying the <hi>Sabbath Day,</hi> viz. because <hi>in six
Days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and
all that in them is, and rested on the seventh Day,</hi> is
to no purpose, yea it is absolute Nonsense. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must necessarily own the Gradual Progress
of the Creation. And let us not only do so, but
observe the Wisdom and Providence of the Infinite
Architect in the Order and Method which he used.
He in creating began with the lowest and meanest
Rank of Beings, and so ascended to higher and
nobler. Simple Elements, as Earth, Water, Fire,
(or Light) Air, were produced before the more
mixt and concrete Bodies. Yea, these Elements
were placed according to the Order and Degree of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46315:630"/>
Gravity, first the <hi>Earth,</hi> subsiding in the lowest
Place of all, (for the Great and Renowned <hi>Tycho</hi>
disdains not this Hypothesis) then the <hi>Waters</hi> or
<hi>Abyss</hi> placed immediately about the Earth: next
the <hi>Air</hi> or <hi>Expansion,</hi> whose Position was above the
Waters: lastly the <hi>Fire,</hi> call'd <hi>Light,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends

<hi>Earth</hi> we mean an opake Body) they are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for at another time, and in another Place,
where it will be most proper to speak of them. It
is also observable, that things that were Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate

such as had a <hi>Vegetative</hi> Life: then things
that had <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Spontaneous Motion,</hi> and lastly
<hi>Reasonable</hi> Creatures. <hi>Man</hi> was the concluding
Work of the Creation, and his <hi>Soul</hi> was the last of
all; to let us know that this sort of Beings is much

to believe that these Glorious Spirits were

Creatures superiour to him. The Order of the

on the <hi>Creation;</hi> so now having given a brief Scheme
of this second Book, I will stay to enlarge upon a
particular Subject of it, which is very Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and Remarkable, <hi>viz.</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (as
<note n="1" place="bottom">Cedren. Hist. Compend.</note> One calls it) the <hi>Tenfold Plague</hi> wherewith God
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:46315:631"/>
testified his Wrath and Anger against the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
Ten times the Israelites were detained by
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and so many times God inflicted Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Judgments on him and his People. The first
was a severe Infliction on their <hi>Waters,</hi> that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is so useful and necessary to Man. The
Divine Displeasure began to exert it self here by
turning all their <hi>Rivers, Ponds, Pools</hi> and <hi>Streams</hi>
into Blood. The dreadful Consequences of which
were these, (as you find them enumerated, <hi>Exod<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
7. 21.) first, they had no Water to drink, and
quench their Thirst with: Secondly, their Fish
(their great and almost only Food) died; and
Thirdly, the Rivers stank, by reason of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified
Waters and dead Fish. So direful was this
Plague on their Waters, which they honour'd above
all other Elements as the first Cause and Principle
of all things in World, and especially their River
<hi>Nile</hi> was gloried in, and worship'd as a God. This
the Learned and Religious<note n="1" place="bottom">De vitâ Mosis.</note> 
                        <hi>Philo</hi> gives as the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of inflicting this Punishment. God sent a Curse
on that which they most prized and valued. That
which they excessively admired, proved a Plague
to them. God punish'd them in that which was
most regarded by them, and was indeed most ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
to them. Again, this is to be observed
that the Blood of the murder'd Infants, who had
been drown'd by one of the <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Command,
is here represented by these <hi>Bloody Waters.</hi> Here
the merciless Tyrant may see the just Retaliation of
that Crime. The Rivers being chang'd into this
Colour, accuse the Egyptians of the inhumane
Slaughter of the innocent Babes, and let them know
that their <hi>Plagues</hi> deservedly begun with these first
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46315:631"/>
of all. Yea, here we may take notice of an Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Omen: these <hi>Red Rivers</hi> were an unhappy but
just Presage of the Fate which they should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
undergo in the <hi>Sea</hi> of that Denomination. If
any <hi>Object</hi> here, How could the <hi>Magicians</hi> turn the
Waters into Blood (<hi>v.</hi> 22.) after <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had done so before them? I Answer, the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Terms used in this Relation are to be restrained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and understood with some Exception, (than which
nothing is more common in Scripture) <hi>i. e.</hi> when
'tis said <hi>all the Rivers</hi> and other Waters were stain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Blood, the meaning is that very few Places
were free from this Infection. The Magicians then
might repeat this Plague in <hi>Goshen,</hi> and some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Parts of <hi>Egypt</hi> where it had not taken effect
before.</p>
                     <p>When this First Plague was removed, God sent
a Second, <hi>viz. Frogs.</hi> Which in part tormented
the Egyptians after the same manner that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
did, for they were of an extraordinary Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
(and so we must suppose all the other <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
hereafter named to be) and infected the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
which were lately healed and recovered, so
that there was no drinking of them, or making
use of them to any other Purpose. But whereas
the former Plague was only on this Element, this
present one was every where. No Place was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
from this Croaking Vermin. They over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread
their <hi>Fields,</hi> they crept into their <hi>Houses,</hi> they
lodg'd themselves in their <hi>Beds.</hi> All Places were
filled with them, all Meats and Drinks bred them.
Certainly this must needs be a very Affrighting as
well as a Noisom Punishment whilst these Animals
were moving and living: and they were no less so
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>fterwards, when they lay dead and putrifying all
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ver the Land.</p>

                        <pb n="338" facs="tcp:46315:632"/>
When this Plague was taken away, a Third
succeeded in its room, an Innumerable Company
of <hi>Lice,</hi> which miserably infested both Men and
Beasts. What these <hi>Kinnim</hi> were we do not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
know: we have no such Creature perhaps
in these Countries. But this we know that these
Loathsom Insects were such a peculiar Sort of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that the Egyptian Sorcerers had not power
to produce the like, and therefore they signally
call'd them <hi>the Finger of God,</hi> Exod. 8. 19. This also
we know that this Crawling Vermin was excessively
troublesom, painful and tormenting: and lastly, from
this kind of Punishment we know this is to be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that God, whensoever he pleases, can give Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
even to the Least, the Vilest and most De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable
Animals to execute his Wrath on Offenders.</p>
                     <p>As appears also by the <hi>Fourth Plague,</hi> viz. <hi>Swarm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is not of <hi>Hebrew</hi> Extraction, but is an <hi>Egyptian</hi>
Word, (as was that whereby the <hi>Frogs</hi> were named)
and signifies peculiarly with them a <hi>Heap or Swarm
of Flies.</hi> The vast Number of these was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
troublesome: but that was not all, these Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of Insects were Infectious and Mortal by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of their intolerable Stench and Filth, with
which they filled the Air: whence 'tis said, <hi>the
Land was corrupted with them,</hi> Exod. 8. 24. And
this Corruption proved fatal to many, who without
doubt would have taken up <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Emploiment,
and managed it better than he did, but they were
not able, for instead of stabbing these Creatures
they were dispatch'd themselves by a more poinant
Stroke.</p>
                     <p>The former Judgments having not produced any
good Effect in this People, God sends a <hi>Fifth</hi> among
them, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Pestilence</hi> or <hi>Murrain,</hi> that destroy'd
their Cattel, their Flocks and Herds of all Kinds:
for when 'tis said <hi>All Cattel died,</hi> it is not simply and
absolutely to be understood (for some remained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as is clear in the <hi>Plague of Hail</hi> afterwards) but of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Cattel <hi>of all Kinds.</hi> These, it seems, they kept and

to make a Gain of them by selling them to other
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46315:633"/>
Nations, although they made no use of them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for Food. Though the Egyptians themselves
escape the fury of this Pestilential Distemper, yet
God punisheth them in their Beasts. These
are destroy'd, to intimate to them what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
deserv'd, who live and acted like Bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Beasts.</p>
                     <p>And now in the next Place it is worth our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
that this Plague is follow'd with the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of <hi>Boils</hi> and <hi>Blains, Botches</hi> and <hi>Swell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

both in Man and Beast; that is, the fifth
Plague was cured by the coming of the Sixth: for
the Venomous and Pestilential Humour which had
seized on the Men, (as I gather from <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 50.
where this particular Punishment on the Egyptians
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was call'd forth into the extream Parts of their
Bodies, and so was thereby evacuated and exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted.
Whence I infer these two Things, 1. That
God may think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>it to send or take away an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Calamity in an ordinary and natural Way:
and 2. That one Calamity or Plague may come in
the Place of another, and even wholly remove that
former Plague, and yet prove a very Great one it
self. Thus it was with the <hi>Boils</hi> and <hi>Impostumes,</hi>
they were a Remedy in a natural Way against the
Pestilence, but they were likewise a Grievous and
Painful Disease, and made them unfit for all Work
and Business. I will only further remark under this
Particular, that it is probable <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> (and
from him <hi>Iustin</hi> the Historian) refers to these <hi>Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
and <hi>Boils,</hi> when he reports that the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
(by whom he means the <hi>Iews,</hi> for he and other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
thought they were originally <hi>Egyptians</hi>) were
driven out of <hi>Egypt</hi> because they were infected with
the Itch, and were overrun with Scabs and Sores.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46315:633"/>
So<note n="1" place="bottom">Hist. l. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Tacitus</hi> relates; that an Epidemick Leprosy or
Scabby Disease plagued the Egyptians Bodies,
whereupon the King consulting the Oracle, gave
order to purge the Country of the Jews, and to
send them into some other Place. It seems to be
grounded on this, though he (as all other Profane
Historians when they speak of the Jews) is guilty
of mistaking and blundering in the way of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
it.</p>
                     <p>The Seventh Plague that these People felt was
<hi>Hail,</hi> which was a very Prodigious thing in it self:
for though it sometimes, but very seldom, <hi>rain'd</hi>
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet <hi>Hail</hi> was never seen before in that
Country. But moreover this was Extraordinary,
being attended with Fire and Storms, Lightning
and Thunder, which slew all the Men and Beasts
that were abroad and remain'd, and destroy'd all
Trees, Plants and Herbs.</p>
                     <p>And because their Wheat and Rye were not at
that time come forth out of the Ground, and other
Fruits of the Earth were not grown up, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
no harm by this Plague, therefore upon
<hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s continued Obstinacy another was soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
inflicted on them, that is, Troops of <hi>Locusts</hi>
and <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> (for these latter are mention'd
<hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 46. &amp; 105. 34.) <hi>such as never were before</hi>
in the World, nor <hi>afterwards ever shall be,</hi> (as 'tis
expresly recorded) invaded them, and unsuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
molested them in their Houses and closest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements,
and quickly devoured all the Fruits of
the Ground which the Hail had not touched.</p>
                     <p>When neither this nor the foregoing Judgment
had any considerable Effect upon the Hardned Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
a New one, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Darkness</hi> (which is

the Ninth in Number) is sent among them. This
was such a <hi>Darkness</hi> as put out all Fires and Lights,

were frustrated when they undertook to kindle or

Elegant Description of it. I do not know any
Profane Writer, any Classick Author, whether
Orator or Poet, that hath parallell'd that Excellent
Piece. There the Worthy Penman acquaints us
with the probable Reasons of their suffering in
that kind, and he suggests how they were haunted
with strange Apparitions in that Long and Dismal
Night, that the Terrors of their Minds and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
were equal with the Affrightments of that
Black Season, that these Dreadful Shades were but
the Representation of that Eternal Blackness and
Darkness into which they were to enter.</p>
                     <p>The last Plague was the <hi>Death of the First-born</hi>
both of Men and Beasts throughout the whole Land.
<hi>There was not a House where there was not one dead;</hi>

in their Possessions, in their Relations. Yea, for

of God's Anger. I proceed now to the other

                        <hi>Leviticus</hi> hath its Name because it treats chiefly
of the Offices of the <hi>Levites,</hi> and the whole <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Order.</hi> It gives us an Account of the <hi>Iewish
Service</hi> and <hi>Worship,</hi> of the particular Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Charges of the Ministers of the Jewish
Church, of their several kinds of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and
<hi>Oblations, (viz.</hi> Burnt-Offerings, Meat-Offerings,
Peace-Offerings, Sin-Offerings, Trespass-Offerings)
of the <hi>Consecration of</hi> Aaron <hi>and his Sons to the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
of Laws about <hi>Clean</hi> and <hi>Vnclean</hi> things, and
of <hi>Difference of Meats.</hi> Here they are forbid to
<hi>eat Blood;</hi> here they are taught how to <hi>discern the
Leprosy,</hi> and how to <hi>cleanse</hi> it. Here are Laws
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46315:635"/>
concerning <hi>Vows,</hi> and Things and Persons devoted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
There are also other Ordinances and Injunctions
concerning their <hi>Solemn Feasts, viz.</hi> the Sabbath of
the seventh Year, the Passover, the Feasts of First-Fruits,
of Pentecost, of Trumpets, of Expiation,
of Tabernacles, and many the like Usages and
Rites which were strictly commanded this People,
on purpose to keep them from the Idolatrous and
Superstitious Ceremonies of the Gentiles that were
round about them, and would be enticing them to
imitate their Practice. Besides, these Rites were
design'd by God to be Types and Representatives
of things of a far higher Nature, even of <hi>Christ</hi>
himself, and the great things which appertain to
the Gospel. There is likewise a great Number of
<hi>Iudicial Laws,</hi> as concerning the Year of Jubilee,
about the Redemption of Lands and Houses,
against taking of Usury of the Poor: as also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Servants and Bondmen. Here are Laws
touching the <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Affinity</hi> and <hi>Consanguinity,</hi>
and consequently what Marriages are lawful, and
what unlawful, may thence be inferr'd: and several
other things belonging to the <hi>Iews Civil Law.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
here are inserted several <hi>Moral</hi> Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Excellent Precepts of Natural Religion,
respecting both God and Men. Lastly, towards
the Close of all there are <hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Curses</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
the former to such as carefully observe
these Laws, the latter on those that wilfully break
them. These a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in this Book, and which have been the acceptable
Entertainment of the Inquisitive and Religious, of

                     <p>The Book of <hi>Numbers</hi> hath its Denomination
from the Numbring of the Families of <hi>Israel,</hi> as
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:46315:635"/>
we may collect from <hi>ch. 1. v.</hi> 3, 4. where we read
that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> had a special Command from
God to Muster the Tribes, and to take the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of all that were fit for War, and to Order and
Marshal the Army when it was once formed. For
now in their Passage through the Wilderness they
were like to meet with many Enemies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'twas convenient to take an Account of their
Forces, and to put themselves into a Posture ready
to engage. A great Part of this Book is <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
relating several Remarkable Passages in the
Israelites March through the Wilderness, as the
<hi>Sedition</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Miriam,</hi> the <hi>Rebellion</hi> of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
and his Companions, the <hi>Murmurings</hi> of the
whole Body of the People, their being <hi>plagued with
firy Serpents, Baalam</hi>'s <hi>Prophesying</hi> of the Happiness
of <hi>Israel</hi> instead of Cursing them, the Miraculous
<hi>Budding</hi> of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s <hi>Rod.</hi> Here also are distinctly
related their Several <hi>Removings</hi> from Place to
Place, their two and forty <hi>Stages</hi> or <hi>Iourneys</hi> through
the Wilderness, and sundry other things which
befel them, whereby we are instructed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in some of the weightiest Truths that have
immediate Reference to God and his Providence
in the World. But the greatest Part of the Book
is spent in enumerating those <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi>
(whether Ceremonial or Civil) which were given
by God, and were not mention'd before in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
Books, as some Particulars of the <hi>Levites
Office,</hi> and the <hi>Number</hi> of them, the <hi>Trial of Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy,</hi>
the Rites to be observ'd by the <hi>Nazarites,</hi>
the <hi>Renewing of the Passover,</hi> the making of <hi>Fringes</hi>
on the Borders of their Garments, the <hi>Water of
Separation</hi> to be used in purifying the Unclean, the
Law of <hi>Inheritance,</hi> of <hi>Vows,</hi> of the <hi>Cities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi>
of the <hi>Cities for the Levites,</hi> and some other
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:46315:636"/>
Constitutions either not inserted into the other
Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> or not so distinctly and plainly
set down. Thus this Book both in respect of the
Historical Part of it, and of the Addition of Laws,
(not spoken of in the foregoing Books) hath its
peculiar Use and Excellency.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> (which signifies a <hi>Second Law</hi>) is a
<hi>Repetition</hi> of the Laws before delivered. It is the
<hi>Canonick Mishnah,</hi> or <hi>New Rehearsal</hi> of the Divine
Law: Which was necessary, because they that
heard it before died in the Wilderness, and there
being now sprung up another Generation of Men,
the Law was to be promulged to them. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
Part of the People that were living at that time
had not heard the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> or any other of the
<hi>Laws</hi> openly proclaimed; or being young, they had
neglected or forgot them. That is the Reason
why <hi>Moses</hi> in this Book rehearseth them to this
new People, and withal adds an <hi>Explication</hi> of
them in many Places, yea and adjoins some <hi>New
Laws, viz.</hi> the taking down of <hi>Malefactors</hi> from
the Tree in the Evening, making of <hi>Battlements</hi> on
the Roofs of their Houses, the Expiation of an
<hi>unknown Murder,</hi> the Punishment to be inflicted on
a <hi>Rebellious Son,</hi> the Distinction of the Sexes by
<hi>Apparel, Marrying the Brother's Wife</hi> after his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease:
also Orders and Injunctions concerning <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,</hi>
concerning <hi>Man-stealers,</hi> concerning <hi>Vnjust
Weights</hi> and <hi>Measures,</hi> concerning the <hi>Marrying of
a captive Woman,</hi> concerning the Servant that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
his Master's Service, and several other Laws
not only <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> but <hi>Military.</hi>
There are likewise inserted some New Actions and
Passages which happened in the last Year of their
Travels in the Wilderness. Moreover, <hi>Moses</hi> in
this Part of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> shews himself a True Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:46315:636"/>
Pastor and Guide to that People, a Hearty
Lover of them and their Welfare in such manifest
Instances as these, his often Inculcating upon them
the many Obligations which they lay under from
God, the Innumerable Favours they had received
from him: his frequent and pathetick Exhortations
to Obedience, and living answerably to the singular
Mercies which were conferr'd upon them: his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Reminding them of their former Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
their Murmurings and Rebellions against
Heaven, and all their Unworthy Deportment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Matchless Benefactor: his compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Forewarning them of the Judgments of God,
of the Various Plagues and Punishments which
would certainly be the Consequence of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in their Sins: Lastly, his Affectionate En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
them to Obedience from the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the endearing Promises which God had
made to them, and which he would assuredly make
good, if they did not frustrate his Designs of Mercy
towards them by their own wilful Obstinacy.
These are the Excellent Subjects of this Divine
Book, and which render it so unvaluable a Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or Five Books of
<hi>Moses.</hi> And that <hi>he</hi> was the Penman of them I
think need not be question'd, though I find it is,
yea flatly denied by <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> and <hi>Pererius,</hi> and
lately by <hi>Hobbs</hi> and <hi>Spinosa.</hi> A very little Portion
of them was writ by him, saith Monsieur <hi>Simon,</hi>
who hath a new Notion of certain <hi>Publick Scribes</hi>
or <hi>Registers</hi> that penn'd this and other Parts of the
Old Testament, (which sort of <hi>Abbreviating Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
he borrows from the Egyptians, (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself) because there were such Officers in
the Egyptian Court who had a Privilege to add to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:46315:637"/>
or take away from, to amplify or abridg the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Records, he thence groundlesly infers there
were such among the <hi>Iews</hi> who made what Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
they pleased in the Sacred Writings): which
Paradox of his I have consider'd, and made some
Reflections upon in a former Treatise. This I
may truly say, that it is not necessary that we should
know who was the <hi>Particular Penman</hi> of this or any
other Book of the Holy Scripture, because the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of them depends not on the Writers of
them, but on the Holy Ghost who endited them.
They are the Books of God, that is their peculiar
Character and Dignity, and that alone makes them
Authentick after they have been delivered to us by
the unanimous Consent of the Church, so that
there is no absolute Necessity of our certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
who penn'd them. Yet this must be said, that
it cannot with Reason be denied that the <hi>Authors</hi> of
some of these Sacred Books are well known, and
particularly there are very convincing Proofs that
<hi>Moses</hi> wrote the Books which I have been giving an
Account of. This may be evinc'd from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Words, <hi>Luke 16. 31. &amp;</hi> 24. 27. where by
<hi>Moses</hi> (as is most evident) he means the <hi>Books of
the Pentateuch,</hi> and consequently thereby lets us
know that <hi>Moses</hi> was the Writer of them. And
more expresly the <hi>Book of Exodus</hi> is call'd <hi>the Book of
Moses</hi> by our same Infallible Master, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 26.
And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that when these Books are
read, <hi>Moses is read,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 19. And both our
Saviour and this Apostle distinguish between <hi>Moses</hi>
and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> Luke 16. 29. Acts 26. 22. plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
signifying that as those <hi>Books</hi> which pass under
the <hi>Prophets</hi> Names are theirs, so these that are
said to be <hi>Moses</hi>'s were written by him. I think this
is very plain, and needs not to be further insisted on.</p>

As to the <hi>Objections</hi> of those Men before named
against this, I forbear to produce them, and to
return particular <hi>Answers</hi> to them, because this is
so lately done by<note n="1" place="bottom">Prolegom. de Scriptore Pentateuchi.</note> Monsieur <hi>Clerk,</hi> and because

that <hi>Moses</hi> himself was the Author of the
Five Books that go under his Name. Wherefore
the particular Fancies of those few <hi>Objectors,</hi> and
those no Friends to the Sacred Text, are not to
be heeded by us. As to that common Scruple
which is so much insisted upon, that in the last
Book of the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> there is mention of <hi>Moses</hi>'s
<hi>Death,</hi> and some things that happen'd after it,
whence they conclude that <hi>Moses</hi> wrote not those
Books, or at least not the last of them; I take this
to be a sufficient <hi>Answer,</hi> that <hi>Moses</hi> being a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
might foresee, and have revealed to him a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Account of his own Death, and so he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
it to writing by a Prophetick Spirit: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
none can from thence prove that he was not
the Penman of all this Book. However, we will
not contend here, for perhaps the Conclusion of
this Book was affixed by <hi>Ioshua,</hi> or afterwards by

                        <hi>Ezra,</hi> who was an Inspired Person likewise, and
who revised the Books of the Old Testament, and
inserted some things into them by the same Spirit
that endited the rest. Notwithstanding then the
foresaid Objection, which refers only to a few Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
in the End of the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for either (as we said before concerning <hi>Moses</hi>) they
were written by him through a Prophetick Spirit

Years. These <hi>Iudges</hi> were Men of Heroick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
raised up by God out of the several Tribes
to govern the People, and to deliver them from
their present Dangers. They were Supream Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
but Temporary; and some of them were
<hi>Types</hi> of our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> and <hi>Deliverer.</hi> In the

their Intimate Converse with those Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
People that were left remaining in that Land,
their Approving of their Superstitious and Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Customs, and their Serving their Gods.

Here is a particular Account of the Corruption of

Practices: which occasion'd the very <hi>Heathens</hi> to

most severely Chastising them, and causing them
to groan under Tyrants and Oppressors. Here
are contain'd in this History most admirable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
of God's Displeasure against Apostates and
such as revolt from the True Religion; and here
are on the contrary as memorable Instances of his
Rewarding those that adhere to Him and his Cause,
and hold fast their Integrity in the worst and most
perillous Times. Here are most amply displayed
his Love and Care of his Church, in stirring up so
many Eminent Worthies and Champions to fight
for her, and to push them on by no less than an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Impulse of Spirit to enterprize and

<hi>Iudges,</hi> in whose time the Things were done that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46315:640"/>
are here related. Particularly a little before <hi>Eli</hi>'s
Time they happen'd: then it was, that there being
a Famine in <hi>Canaan, Elimelech</hi> and his Wife <hi>Naomi,</hi>
and their Sons went into the Land of <hi>Moab;</hi> and
there these latter were married, one to <hi>Ruth</hi> and
the other to <hi>Orphah.</hi> After ten Years were expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Elimelech</hi> and his Sons died: whereupon <hi>Nao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi>
and her Daughter-in-Law <hi>Ruth</hi> (for the other
Daughter stay'd behind) returned to their own
Country, and coming to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> were kindly
received by <hi>Boaz</hi> their Kinsman. The Particulars
of this kind Reception and Entertainment are set
down here, and the Close was, that he married
<hi>Ruth,</hi> who bare to him <hi>Obed,</hi> who was the Grand-father
of <hi>David.</hi> It is true, this is but a Private
History: yet, as it is such, it contains in it many
things worthy of our observation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Children in their Affection and Regards to
their Parents; <hi>Orphah</hi> with great Ease and Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
left <hi>Naomi,</hi> but <hi>Ruth</hi> clave unto her: the
Prudent Instructions and Wise Demeanour of that
Excellent Matron towards her Daughter the young
Widow: (Though I must needs add with reference
to <hi>Ruth</hi>'s Behaviour, that her Boldness and almost
endangering of her Chastity, are not to be Examples
to others: for <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Shamefacedness</hi> are the
proper Qualities of that Sex. Wedlock is not to
be sought after by them with such peril. And
therefore this daring Fact of this Venturous Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
is to be look'd upon as an extraordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and not to be imitated by other Females<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)
Here is remarkable the Merciful Providence of
God towards the Afflicted, the Widows, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless:
the Reward of Constancy and Obedience;
the Blessing of God upon those that fear him and
trust in him. Besides, here are observable the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:46315:640"/>
Antient <hi>Right of Kinsmen,</hi> and of <hi>Redemption,</hi> and
the <hi>Manner of buying the Inheritance of the Deceased,</hi>
with other Things of great Antiquity. Nay, this
is more than Private History; as will appear if we
consider that this Pious Woman <hi>Ruth</hi> was the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Obed</hi> the Father of <hi>Iesse,</hi> the Father of <hi>David,</hi>
of whom our <hi>Lord Christ</hi> came, and therefore you
find her inserted into his <hi>Genealogy</hi> by St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
Again, <hi>Ruth,</hi> a <hi>Moabitish</hi> Woman, of the Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Daughters of <hi>Lot,</hi> was a Type, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed an Eminent Instance of the Calling of the
Gentiles into the Church, which is a Thing of no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Concern, but of the largest Extent imaginable.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Two Books of Samuel</hi> are Publick Histories,
the former whereof contains Things done under the
two last <hi>Iudges, Eli</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and under the first
<hi>King,</hi> who was <hi>Saul,</hi> as also the Acts of <hi>David</hi>
whilest he lived under <hi>Saul.</hi> Here is a Narrative
of the Change of the <hi>Iudges</hi> into <hi>Kings,</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi>

                        </hi>
and of the Great and Many Evils which they suffer'd
as consequent upon it, all worthy of our serious
Perusal and Consideration. Here is an Account
of their New King's being deposed by God, <hi>viz.</hi>
for his rash and prophane Sacrificing, and his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
disobeying the express Command of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

<pb n="356" facs="tcp:46315:641"/>
are mixed the great Failings and Miscarriages of
that King, (which are as particularly recorded as
his other Acts) and as a Consequent of them, the
many Disappointments and Crosses he met with,
the various Judgments and Plagues which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on him and his People by God.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Books of the Kings</hi> are the History of the
Kingdoms of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> under the Reigns of
their several Kings. The first contains the latter
Part of the Life of <hi>David,</hi> and his Death; the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Prosperity of that Nation under <hi>Solomon</hi> who
succeeded him; his erecting and consecrating of the
Temple at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> his scandalous Defection
from the true Religion: the sudden Decay of the
Jewish Nation after his Death, when it was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into two Kingdoms under <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who
reign'd over the two Tribes of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi>

over the other ten Tribes that revolted from
the House of <hi>David.</hi> The rest of it is spent
in relating the Acts of four Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> and
eight of <hi>Israel.</hi> The second Book, which is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of the History of the Kings, is a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Memorable Acts of sixteen Kings of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
and twelve of <hi>Israel,</hi> and the End of both
Kingdoms by the carrying of the Ten Tribes Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
into <hi>Assyria</hi> by <hi>Salmanasser,</hi> and the other two
into <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the just Rewards

And though we know not which of these Histories,

                        <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> or the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> (I speak as to

                     <p>These Books of <hi>Chronicles,</hi> together with those of
the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> make up the Best and Choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
History in the World. Here we are abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furnish'd with such Useful Notices, Truths and
Maxims as these (all confirmed by Noted and Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious
Examples and such Instances as are Certain
and Unquestionable.) Crowned Heads are encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled
with Cares, and seldom find rest and repose:
though their Lives are more Splendid, yet they
are not less Calamitous than those of the Common
People. Good Kings are rare, and the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of them is inconsiderable in comparison of
those that are Bad. The best Kings have their
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:46315:642"/>
Faults, and some of them of a very scandalous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
There is little Piety in Princes Courts, and
as little Integrity and Honesty. The People are
easily induced to follow the Examples of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours:
and Religion and Manners too often va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
according to the Wills of Superiours. Good
Kings are the greatest Blessing, and Wicked Ones
are the greatest Curse to a Nation. Princes mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
their Measures when they either disobey God,
or oppress their People. Tyrannical Princes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their own Ruine. The Sins and Vices of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
prove fatal to their Subjects. Publick Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
are punish'd with Publick and National Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.
Kings may be known by the Ministers
they choose and make use of. Those Counsels
that are founded in Religion are most successful.
Evil Counsellours contrive their own Destruction.
Wars are the Effect and Consequence of fighting
against God. The Success of Arms depends upon
the Divine Blessing. The Church is never more
shock'd than under Bad Princes. Religion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
are never effectually promoted unless the
Great Ones have a Hand in them. Divisions and
Rents about Religion have immediate influence on
Secular Affairs: and when the Church is divided,
the State is so too. The Revolutions in both are
by the particular Disposal of the Wise Over-ruler
of the World. True Religion and Godliness are
attended with Earthly Rewards and Blessings: and
the contrary bring down the greatest Plagues even
in this World. The worst Times afford some of
the Best and most Holy, Religious and Zealous
Men. Whatever Changes and Revolutions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
in the Kingdoms of the Earth, the Church of
God remains secure. Though there are great and
frequent Defections, yet there never is a total Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46315:642"/>
of it. In a Word, the Church is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
this Rock is immoveable. And many other
Propositions and Maxims of the like Nature, which
are of great Service in the Life of Man, are to be
deduced from these Excellent Histories.</p>

Conduct of <hi>Ezra</hi> a Priest, who had been a Courtier
in the Persian Court, and was sent into <hi>Iudea</hi> by

the Penman of this Book, and who was also a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storer
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:46315:643"/>
of the Sacred Books of the Old Testament,
and collected and methodized them into certain

left of, and continues the History of the <hi>Building
of Ierusalem,</hi> and of the <hi>Deportment of the Iews</hi> in
those times, from the twentieth Year of <hi>Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes</hi>
to the Reign of <hi>Darius,</hi> about fifty Years in
all. As <hi>Ezra</hi> chiefly related the Restoring of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Erecting the Temple, so this Author
gives us an Account of the Building of the City,
and the Reformation of the Religion which had
been restored. In several Particulars he shews
what were the <hi>Abuses</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and how they were redressed, even by his
own Hand. He tells us what Methods he took of
regulating both their Ecclesiastical and Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
in short, of <hi>Reforming</hi> both Church and
State, which were even then so early corrupted.
From the whole, both here and in the Book of
<hi>Ezra,</hi> we are taught many useful Lessons, but This
above all, that the Gates of Hell shall not prevail
against the <hi>Church,</hi> that they shall never have Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

the Opinions of Authors) I will not here dispute.
Only we know that the Sacred Writings and the
Profane intend the same Person sometimes, though
they give different Names. The Story is this,
<hi>Haman</hi> a great Favourite and Minion of the King,
and advanced to great Honour by him, was highly
incens'd against <hi>Mordecai,</hi> one of the Captive Jews,
because he refused to do him Reverence, and to
Bow to him. Whereupon he resolv'd, for his
sake, to compass the Destruction of all the <hi>Iews</hi> in
those Territories, and to that end gain'd a Decree
from the King to put them all to the Sword. But
this wicked Design was happily frustrated by means
of <hi>Esther</hi> a Jewish Captive Virgin, who for her
transcendent Beauty had a little time before been
advanced to the Throne, and now prevail'd with
her Royal Husband to spare the Life of her dear
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:46315:644"/>
Countrymen. In this manner <hi>Haman</hi>'s cursed
Conspiracy was defeated, he himself advanced to a
Gibbet, and that of his own preparing, the Jews
delivered from their Fears and Dangers, <hi>Mordecai</hi>
who discover'd this Bloody Design to Queen <hi>Esther,</hi>
and who had before that discover'd another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
<hi>viz.</hi> against the King, which was record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Chronicles, and about this time read to
him, and was in a great measure serviceable by the
Divine Providence to bring about this happy Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of <hi>Haman</hi>'s Plot; this <hi>Mordecai</hi> (I say)
was preferr'd unto the greatest Honours in the
Kingdom, (and by the by let me suggest, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
from his riding the King's Horse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
being preferr'd to Kingly Dignity, the Story of
<hi>Darius</hi>'s being made King of <hi>Persia</hi> by the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his Horse had its Rise; for, as I have often
had occasion in another Place to prove, the Gentile
Historians mistook one Person for another) the
Hearts and Mouths of all the Jews in the King's
Provinces were filled with Joy, and an Annual
Festival was appointed to be kept in all succeeding
Generations in remembrance of this singular and
unexpected Deliverance vouchsafed to them. This
is the Sum of this Short History, in which there
are many Admirable and Surprizing Circumstances
which (though they could not be particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
here) commend it to the Reader. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a most Remarkable Instance of God's Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Providence and Goodness to his Church, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
and defeating the Contrivances of her
malicious and cruel Enemies, in delivering her in
her greatest Extremities, and in bringing Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and Ruine on the Heads of those who plot
her Downfal. As to the <hi>Author</hi> of this Book,
there is no Agreement among Writers; though
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46315:644"/>
one would be enclined to think that it was <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai</hi>'s
by reading <hi>ch.</hi> 9. v. 20. and <hi>ch.</hi> 12. of <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal
Esther,</hi> v. 4.</p>
                     <p>The next Penman of the Old Testament is <hi>Iob,</hi>
whose Book might have been placed next to the
<hi>Pentateuch,</hi> if it be true (as is generally believ'd)
that he lived about <hi>Moses</hi>'s time: Though<note n="1" place="bottom">Origen, Jerom, Eusebius, Selden.</note> some
are of opinion that he lived a considerable time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Israelites came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that he
was before <hi>Moses.</hi> It was writ by himself, say
<hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Suidas:</hi> but the <hi>Rabbins</hi> generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<hi>Moses</hi> the Author. Others make <hi>Solomon</hi>
the Author of this Book, discovering, as they
think, his manner of speaking in it. The most
probable Account is, that the Materials of this
Book were drawn up first by <hi>Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> himself, or one
or all of his Pious <hi>Friends</hi> that were concern'd in
the things spoken of here, and that they coming
to <hi>Moses</hi>'s Hands, (as some of the Jewish Masters
tell us) or afterwards to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, were made up
into Hebrew <hi>Verse,</hi> as we now find it. For the

and indeed is the first <hi>Poetical</hi> Book we meet with
in the Bible. Whence we may infer something

all the very Words which are set down in this
Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Men do not use to speak in Verse in
their Discourse one with another, and especially in
such a Lofty Stile of Poetry as we read here some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.
But this is true, that both their Thoughts
and Words were exactly agreeable to what is here
written, and Things actually and really happen'd
as they are here represented: only the Whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46315:645"/>
being clothed in Verse, the individual and
express Words, which they all the time used, are
not always written down, neither indeed could
be. But we must by no means attend to the Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudick
Doctors, who tell us, that this Book is not
a Relation of Matter of Fact, but writ in a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
way to exhibit to the World an Eminent
Example of Patience. Nor are the Words of the
<hi>Parisaan</hi>

History is true, but the Circumstances of it are feigned.</hi>
There is no Fiction in it, because it is as to the
whole Matter of it Real, and relates what actually
happen'd: only as to the Words and Stile, it is
Poetically composed. I might observe that this
Historical Poem is in way of <hi>Dialogue,</hi> or rather is
made up of <hi>feveral Dialogues</hi> and <hi>Colloquies.</hi> It is a
<hi>Dramatick</hi> Piece, wherein Six Persons have their
Parts; <hi>Iob, Eliphaz, Bildad, Zophar, Elihu,</hi> and
<hi>GOD,</hi> who speaks in the Close of all. Nor is this
unusual in some other Books of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
where we find that some of <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Psalms</hi>
are <hi>Dialogue-wise:</hi> and nothing is more evident,
than that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Song</hi> is after that manner: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that (as a<note n="4" place="bottom">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

some of the Other Writings of this <hi>Wise Man,</hi>
and in many Places of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epistles</hi> a Tacit
Dialogue is contain'd, whence it happens that that
sometimes is taken by unskilful Readers for an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
or an Argument which is indeed a Question
or an Objection. Indeed this <hi>Dialogizing</hi> way is of
great Advantage, and carries a peculiar Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
with it, and therefore was (as we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice)
made use of by the Antients. Drawing forth
and pressing out the Truth by way of Dialogue was
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:46315:645"/>
the <hi>Socratick</hi> Mode; which <hi>Plato</hi> also used, laying
down his own Opinion in the Person of <hi>Socrates,
Timaeus,</hi> &amp;c. and other Mens Opinions and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the Person of <hi>Gorgias,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Cicero</hi>
dealt in this way in some of his Writings. The
same likewise we find practised of old by some of
the most Eminent Writers of the Christian Church,
as <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> who sets forth the manner of his
becoming a Christian in the Platonick way, <hi>i. e.</hi> of
a Colloquy: and the whole Discourse with <hi>Trypho</hi>
is no more perhaps than the Personating of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and a Jew by way of Dialogue. <hi>Minutius Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi>'s
Debate between <hi>Octavius</hi> and <hi>Caecilius,</hi> a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
and a Gentile, is of the same Nature. It is
probable that this Antient Pract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ce of delivering.
Truth in this manner was derived from the <hi>Book of
Iob,</hi> the Oldest Dialogue in the World; and
which moreover is in way of a <hi>Disputation,</hi> where
<hi>Iob</hi> is <hi>Respondent,</hi> his <hi>three Friends</hi> the <hi>Opponents;</hi>
and <hi>Eli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>u,</hi> yea and at last <hi>God</hi> himself the <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi>
And one thing by the by I would here observe,
that it is said, <hi>ch. 31. v. 40. The Words of Job are
ended:</hi> which we must understand with reference
to this Contrast between him and his Friends; for
otherwise <hi>Iob</hi> had not made an end of Speaking,
as we find in some of the following Chapters.
Therefore the Meaning is, that his Words in way
of Contention and Controversy with those Men
were ended: and thus the first Verse in the ensuing
Chapter explains it [<hi>So these three Men ceased to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi>
Job.</p>
                     <p>The whole affords us many Excellent Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the greatest Wealth and Riches are
uncertain, that suddenly and unexpectedly they
make themselves Wings, and fly away from the
Possessors, and leave them in Want, Distress and
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:46315:646"/>
Misery: that Integrity and Holiness of Life exempt
no Man from this Changeableness of his Condition,
are no Protection against the worst of outward
Evils whatsoever, whether procured by Satan or
by Evil Men. This is taught us in the Example of
this Great Man, yea<note n="1" place="bottom">Job 1. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>the Greatest of all the Men in
the East,</hi> i. e. in <hi>Arabia;</hi> and who was as Good as
he was Great, for<note n="2" place="bottom">Ver. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>he was a Perfect and Vpright
Man,</hi> nay<note n="3" place="bottom">Ver. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>there was none like him in the Earth.</hi>
This was the true <hi>Arabian Phoenix,</hi> there was none
but he at that time. But this Person who was so
famed for his Greatness and Goodness, came at last
to be as noted for his Low and Mean Condition,
his Troubles and Distresses of all kinds, and those
too of the highest Degree; for he was bereft of
all his Dear Children by the Fall of the House where
they were, he was despoiled of all his Goods and
Estate by the Chaldean and Sabean Free-booters;
he was deprived of his Bodily Health, and smitten
with Painful and Loathsom Diseases by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Hand of the Malicious Demons; he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
scorn'd, derided by the vilest Race of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Hence we are instructed that the worst of
Temporal Evils do sometimes befal the most Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Persons. And we are taught from <hi>Iob</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
also, that the Holiest Men have their Fits of
Impatience: they are heard sometimes to complain
and cry out under their Burden, they expostulate
with God, and question the Reasonableness and
Justice of his Dealings with them, they magnify
their own Innocence at too high a rate, they are
weary of their Lives, and passionately wish for a
Period of them. This was <hi>Iob</hi>'s Case, and may be
of other Righteous Men: they may through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46315:646"/>
Frailty be for a time subject to the same Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,
and shew themselves as uneasy under their
Afflictions, especially when with this Holy Man
they are wounded in Spirit, and buffeted by Satan,
and lie under the Sense of God's Wrath, and have
no Apprehension of his Grace and Favour. But
(as the Hebrew Doctors say)<note n="1" place="bottom">Homo non capitur in hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

when he is in the Extremity of Pain and
Anguish.</p>
                     <p>But yet we are to observe likewise that this Good
Man, even in the midst of his most pressing Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
was never quite run down by them, but at
one time or other shew'd by his Words and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
that he had got the Conquest of them. <hi>You
have heard of the Patience of</hi> Job, saith St.<note n="2" place="bottom">Chap. 5 v. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Iames;</hi>
and this Patience was as eminent as his Disasters:
for we hear him<note n="3" place="bottom">Job 1. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>blessing the Name of the Lord</hi> not
only for what <hi>he gave,</hi> but for what <hi>he took away</hi>
from him: we hear him protecting, that<note n="4" place="bottom">Ch. 13. v. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>though
God should stay him, yet he would trust in him:</hi> we
hear him expressing his Foresight, Perswasion and
Assurance, that<note n="5" place="bottom">Ch. 19. v. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>his Redeemer liveth, and that he
shall stand at the latter Day upon the Earth; and tho
after his Skin Worms destroy his Body, yet in his Flesh
he shall see God.</hi> All which are most evident Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of his Patience under his Crosses, of his
Thankfulness to God for them, of his Strong Faith
and Confidence in him that he should be delivered
from them, and of his hearty Perswasion that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doth or can happen to Mankind without
God's Good Pleasure, nothing can betide us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:46315:647"/>
his Leave and Consent: which is the greatest
Comfort and Refreshment, the highest Repose and
Satisfaction to our Minds imaginable. This indeed
is one grand Design of this Book to bring the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of good Men to an even and placid Frame on
this Consideration, that God hath the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the World, and doth what he thinks fit
with his Creatures as to the outward Condition
they are liable to in this Life; that the Providence
of God orders all the Actions and Enterprizes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Men or Devils, so that nothing can come
to pass without the Divine Permission, Grant and
Superintendence. This is that which is more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
aimed at in this Book: we are taught here
not to quarrel with our Maker, not to find fault
with Heaven. This doth not become us in the
least; it is rather the Deportment of a <hi>Chinoise
Priest,</hi> who hath so much Power over his <hi>Gods,</hi>
that he is suffer'd to beat and whip them when they
don't act (as he thinks) as he would have them.</p>
                     <p>We have likewise the Wretched State of Wicked
Men and Hypocrites most graphically set forth in
these Dialogues. We have God's Infinite Justice
and Unfearchable Wisdom fully asserted and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.
We have the Mighty Power of God in
some of his Creatures described by Himself in a
Stile befitting his Majesty. In the Close of all we
have the happy Period of Innocence and Integrity:

is infinitely worthy of the Studies of the Curious
and Philosophical, of the Lovers of Learning and
Antiquity, of those that value the Primitive
Tongues, Arts and Customs: for here is an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Mixture of all these, which cannot but be a
grateful Entertainment to Inquisitive Spirits.

                     <p>The <hi>Psalms</hi> are the next Poetick Book, and

of them.<note n="8" place="bottom">Origen, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom,

he was the sole Author, but they can scarcely be
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46315:648"/>
credited in that, because the Title of the <hi>90th</hi>
Psalm and others tells us, that they were composed
by <hi>Moses.</hi> Some of them, it is thought, were
made by <hi>Asaph, Heman, Ethan, Ieduthun,</hi> who
were in <hi>David</hi>'s time: but others think these were
not Sacred <hi>Poets,</hi> but only skilful <hi>Musicians</hi> or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Quire, and did not endite these Psalms
which bear their Names, but only set them to
Tunes, and sung them. Though a<note n="1" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Dr.</hi> Lightfoot.</note> Modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is of the Opinion that <hi>Heman</hi> and <hi>Ethan</hi> liv'd
in the time of the Egyptian Bondage, and penn'd
the <hi>88th</hi> and <hi>89th</hi> Psalms on that occasion, in the
former condoling their present Distress, in the
latter prophesying of Deliverance. The <hi>92d</hi> Psalm
was made by <hi>Adam,</hi> saith the <hi>Targum</hi> and the
Hebrew Doctors generally agree to it. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and scarcely denied by any, that the <hi>137th</hi>
Psalm was writ in the time of the Jews Captivity
in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and therefore could not be made by
<hi>David:</hi> and other Psalms seem to be made after
their Return, the Authors of which are not known.
And some, it is likely, were endited by <hi>Solomen,</hi>
as the <hi>45th,</hi> which is a <hi>Song of Loves,</hi> (as the Title
acquaints us) and is of the same Strain with his
other <hi>Nuptial Song,</hi> inserted by it self into the Holy
Scriptures. It may be concluded then that the
Book of Psalms is not the Issue of One Inspired
Brain only; but yet that the Greatest Part of it
was endited and written by <hi>David,</hi> who had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Gift of Poetry and Psalmody, of composing,
making, and singing of Pious Songs. Such are
these Psalms, which, excepting a few of them,
were the Work of this Holy Man, and therefore
they are deservedly called <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Psalms,</hi> the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:46315:648"/>
Denomination being taken from the greater Part.</p>
                     <p>They are divided into five Lesser Books, which
you may know thus; where you find a Psalm end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Amen,</hi> (as the <hi>41st, 72d, 89th, 106th,</hi> and
the last Psalm) there is the Period of the Book, and
another begins. By this you may understand that
Passage in <hi>Psal. 72. v. ult. The Prayers of</hi> David <hi>the
Son of</hi> Jesse <hi>are ended; i. e.</hi> here is an End of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Book of <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms: the rest that follow
are other Collections of them. Of these some are
<hi>Alphabetical,</hi> i. e. composed according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Hebrew Letters: such is the <hi>119th</hi>
Psalm, and is stiled by the <hi>Masora</hi> the <hi>Great Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi>
the eight first Verses beginning with the first

by this Word to begin another Sentence or
Period. But another Classis of Interpreters look
upon this Word not as a <hi>Note of Musick,</hi> but of

                        <hi>Observation</hi> or <hi>Remark,</hi> and are perswaded that it

and more especially worthy of our consideration.

It is derived from <hi>sal</hi> or <hi>salal, exaltavit,</hi>

and at the same time the lifting up of the Heart, the

of the <hi>Messias</hi> in the Flesh, his Sufferings, Death,

Circumstances appertaining to these, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the Jewish Nation, the Conversion of
the Gentiles, the Wonderful Propagation of the
Gospel, and the Success of Christ's Kingdom upon
Earth. Again, some of these Psalms are <hi>Petitory,</hi>
begging with the highest Zeal and Devotion those
things which are the proper Object of our Prayers,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46315:650"/>
and thereby teaching us what we ought to implore
of Heaven, and in what manner we should put up
our Addresses. Others are <hi>Eucharistical,</hi> wherein
the Psalmist discovers the Grateful Resentments of
his Mind by an open Recognition of the Divine
Bounty to him, and by sending up continual Praises
unto the Author of all those Favours and Blessings
daily heaped upon him: at the same time teaching
us to pay the like Tribute of Devotion to the same
Bountiful Hand, and to take all Occasions (as he
doth) of testifying our Thankful Sense of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Goodness. Of this sort more especially is
the <hi>113th</hi> Psalm with the five following ones, which
are call'd by the Jews <hi>the Great Hallelujah,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> saith) <hi>the Great Hymn,</hi> which
they used at their three Chief Feasts, especially at

Some are <hi>Hortatory,</hi> with singular Earnestness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting

wicked Men to abandon their sinful Ways, and

of the most High to fear and reverence his Name,
to trust at all times in him, and to be obedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his holy Laws and Statutes. Others are <hi>Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory,</hi>
administring Peace and Joy to all that are
upright in Heart and Life, breathing nothing but
Heavenly Solace and Satisfaction to distressed
Minds, such as never came from any Mouth but
what was Inspired. Some of them are <hi>Penitential,</hi>

wherein the Holy Man with infinite Sorrow and

several of the foremention'd Heads in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
so that there is no Book of Devotion extant in the

Conditions and Occasions of Mankind, the
more fitted for the several Purposes of the Devout,
the more serviceable to all the great Ends of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

I may conclude, that there is not such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Excellent Collection of Devotions under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as This of the Pious King and Prophet. Here
are all things that are proper to beget Religion and
Piety in us, here is every thing that is serviceable
to nourish and sustain all our Vertues and Graces,
and that in the utmost height of them.</p>
                     <p>Before I pass to the next Book, I will add a few
Words concerning the Nature of the Poetry here
used. This is to be said with great Truth, that
these <hi>Poetical Measures</hi> are far different from those
which we have been acquainted with in Other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
But then it is not to be question'd, that tho
we are ignorant of the true Quality of these Poetick
Numbers, yet they are very Melodious and Lofty,
and not unworthy of the best Poets. It is not to be
doubted that there is a certain <hi>Artificial Meter</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in this Book, which renders the several <hi>Odes</hi>
and <hi>Hymns</hi> very delightful. The<note n="1" place="bottom">Animadyers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Euse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

denies (and that with some Earnestness and
Sharpness, otherwise he would not shew himself
his Father's own Son) that there is any thing like
this in this Book; though at the same time he
grants that the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and almost all <hi>Iob,</hi> are
<hi>Metrical.</hi> But <hi>Iosephus</hi> and <hi>Philo,</hi> two Learned
Jews, and who may reasonably be thought to be
Competent Judges in this Matter, attest the <hi>Meter</hi>
of these Psalms (as well as of the Books of <hi>Iob,
&amp;c.)</hi> So do <hi>Origen, Eusebius, Ierom,</hi> and some of
the most Judicious Criticks among the Moderns.
But then they confess that the Meter is not so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
as that of succeeding Poets. And who sees
not that even these exceedingly vary in their Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures?
It is not denied that <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides,
Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> write in Verse: but they can
scarcely be said to do so in comparison of <hi>Homer</hi>
and <hi>Virgil.</hi> There are some <hi>Hexameters, Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicks,
Saphicks,</hi> and other known kinds of Verses
in <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Psalms,</hi> but they are very rare, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
pure and unmix'd: but notwithstanding this,
it is easy to perceive (if we be observant and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive)
that there are several Verses together
that are <hi>Matrical.</hi> The <hi>Arabian</hi> Criticks tell us,
that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is written in a sort of Verse,
and sometimes in Rythme, but every Reader can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find this. No more can an ordinary Eye or
Ear discern the Numbers in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verse: for
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> way of measuring their Feet was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that which is in use among the <hi>Greek</hi>
and <hi>Latin</hi> Poets; yet so as we may oftentimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a certain Harmony of Syllables. And as
the Psalms are <hi>Metrical,</hi> so some of them are
<hi>Rhythmical.</hi> This is clear in the very Entrance of
these Divine Hymns;

of the Canticle or Mystical Song of Solomon
briefly set forth. It is evinc'd from very cogent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
that Solomon died in the Favour of God,
and was saved. The Books of the Four Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Isaiah, Jeremiah, with his Lamentations,
Ezekiel, Daniel, are described. So are those of
the Twelve Lesser Prophets, Hosea, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>WHO should succeed <hi>David</hi> but <hi>Solomon,</hi> as
in the Throne, so in the Sacred Canon of
the Bible? And He, like his Father, was
a Divine <hi>Poet:</hi> his three Books, <hi>viz. the Proverbs,
Ecclesiastes,</hi> and his <hi>Song</hi> being written in <hi>Hebrew
Verse.</hi> The first of these Books is composed of
Excellent <hi>Proverbs</hi> (whence it hath its Name.)
By this word <hi>Mishle,</hi> which is here rendred <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs,</hi>
sometimes are signified, I. <hi>Parables strictly so call'd,</hi>
which are no other than <hi>Apologues</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial

                        <hi>Trite and

3. <hi>Sarcastick Speeches,</hi> Gibes, Taunts, (as in 2 <hi>Chron.
7. 20. Psal.</hi> 69. 11.) are intended by this Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and this Book of <hi>Solomon</hi> is not wholly desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of these. 4. The Hebrew Word denotes
such <hi>Speeches as are by way of Similitude,</hi> Ezek. 18. 2.
of which kind there are many in this Book, as that
in <hi>ch. 11. 22. As a Iewel of Gold in a Swine's Snout,
so is a fair Woman without Discretion:</hi> and in <hi>ch. 25.
11. A Word fitly spoken is like Apples of Gold in
Pictures of Silver.</hi> This we find to be the frequent
manner of the Wise Man's speaking in this Book:
he generally illustrates and amplifies his Doctrine
by some fit Simily or Comparison, so that thereby
it is as it were twice deliver'd. 5. Sayings that
are mixed with some <hi>Obscurity</hi> and <hi>Intricacy,</hi> such
Speeches as require Sharpness of Wit and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
both for propounding and conceiving
them, are denoted by this Word in Scripture.
Thus an <hi>Intricate Question</hi> or <hi>Problem [Mashal]</hi> is
set down in <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 4, 5. and in the rest of the
Psalm there is an Answer to this Problem, a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of this Difficult Point. <hi>Proverbial</hi> Sentences

                        <hi>Enigmatical,</hi> and have a Meaning

Thus you'l find some Sayings that carry a

v. 27. It is not good to eat much Honey;</hi> and such like
Allegorical and Allusive Speeches, which contain in
them a higher Sense than the bare Words import.
This Proverbial manner of Speaking and Writing
was in great Use and Esteem among the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
and all the <hi>Eastern Countries:</hi> whence it was that
the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> came to <hi>prove</hi> Solomon <hi>with hard

Yea, this way of Speaking may generally be taken

of <hi>Antient</hi> Times. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> were
much addicted to this Abstruse way, and all their

of things. 6. By this Word we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
all Wise and Excellent Sayings, <hi>graviter

especially any Eminent Speech or Smart Saying for

Concise and Pithy Adagies, the very Extracts and

                     <p>The whole Book is divisible into three main
Parts; 1. The Inscription or Title of the Book,
which contains the Use and Scope of it, <hi>The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs
of</hi> Solomon <hi>the Son of</hi> David, <hi>King of</hi> Israel,

or (which is the same thing) Holy and Religious.
2. The Preface or Introduction to the Book, which
is a General Exhortatory to True Wisdom and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.
This is the Subject of the first Nine Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
3. The Main Body of the Book (from the
Beginning of the <hi>10th</hi> Chapter to the Close of all)
which comprehends in it several Excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
Rules and Cautions of a mixt and various
Nature, applicable to the different Circumstances,
Cases, and Occasions of Persons. These are more
signally called <hi>Mishlim</hi> the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> a Collection of

whether we look upon them in a Natural, Civil, or
Religious Capacity, whether we consider them
Alone or as Members of a Society, whether we
speak of them as they are desirous to live happily
here or hereafter, or rather as they desire both.
To all these excellent Purposes they may be plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
furnished by this Royal Author, this Great

had carefully recorded them, and in the greatest
Part of his Life had observ'd them, But whether
the Encomium of a <hi>Vertuous Woman,</hi> or a <hi>Good

are sure of, that it was dictated by Divine Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

it is observable that it is composed in <hi>Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betical</hi>
Order, <hi>i. e.</hi> according to the Series of the
Hebrew Letters, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

took notice of before.</p>
                     <p>Before I dismiss this Book, it may not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
here to observe concerning several of the
<hi>Proverbs,</hi> that they may be applied several ways.
Accordingly as we interpret the <hi>Similitude</hi> which is
made use of in them, so we may form the Sense of
the Place: and this ought not to offend any good
or wise Man. To give an Instance or two: <hi>As he
that bindeth a Stone in a Sling, so is he that giveth Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
to a Fool,</hi> Prov. 26. 8. The Meaning of which
may be, that Honour conferr'd on an undeserving
Person is thrown away and lost, like a Stone cast
out of a Sling. Or thus, he that bestows Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Dignity on such an one, doth as 'twere
Arm him against himself; he helps to do himself a
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:46315:655"/>
Mischief, because he puts him into a Capacity of
doing it. Others have a different Notion of the
word <hi>Margemah,</hi> (which is here translated a <hi>Sling</hi>)
and by it understand a <hi>Heap of Stones,</hi> and they
frame such an Interpretation as this; He that gives
Respect and Honour to a Fool, to an unworthy vile
Person, is like him that casts a Pretious Stone (for
so they limit the Sense of the word <hi>Eb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the word <hi>Margemah,</hi> telling us it is the same

Proverb thus, As he that laps up one of the Stones
in the Street in a Purple Vest, so is he that gives
Respect and Honour to a: Fool, a wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The <hi>Canticles,</hi> or <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Song,</hi> is another Piece
of Hebrew Poetry, which he writ when he was
Young, and in an Amorous Vein, and yet breathing
most Divine and Heavenly Amours. If you take
it according to the <hi>Letter</hi> only, it is King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
<hi>Epithalamium</hi> or <hi>Wedding-Song,</hi> of the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with the <hi>45th</hi> Psalm, which is a Song on his
<hi>Nuptials</hi> with the <hi>King of</hi> Egypt<hi>'s Daughter,</hi> but in
a Spiritual Sense it sets forth the Glory of <hi>Christ</hi> and
his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and the Duty and Privileges of the
<hi>Church,</hi> which is there called <hi>the King's Daughter.</hi>
Such is this <hi>Dramatick Poem,</hi> wherein are brought

of our most serious Perusal and Study. For

we not discouraged from receiving these Writings as
<hi>Canonical Scripture</hi> when we know that the Author of
them was a Damned Person? For what can He be else,
who, towards his latter end, revolted from the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and went after Strange Gods and Strange Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?
And we never read in Scripture that he repented
either of his Idolatry or his Whoredoms. Is it likely
that this Gross Apostate was inspired by the Holy Ghost?
Is it probahle that he had the Honour of being one of the
Penmen of Sacred Writ?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It is true <hi>Solomon</hi> was as great a Reproach
to the True Religion as ever any Person was, if
we consider <hi>all</hi> his Circumstances: His Sins were
of a very High Nature, his Faults were most Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
and Scandalous; and that Man is half guilty
of them that endeavours to excuse them. A most
provoking Crime it was in him that had been so
highly favour'd of God to give himself up to his
Lusts: a most horrid Offence it was, even in his
old Age, in the close of his Life, (as if now his
Years had made him <hi>Decrepid</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous</hi> too) to
bow down to Idols. But shall we think that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
bowed so low that he could not rise again,
that he fell and never recovered himself? I confess
no meaner a Man than St. <hi>Augustin</hi> seems to be of
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:46315:660"/>
this Opinion. This Hard Father of Infants was
as harsh against <hi>Solomon,</hi> pronouncing him a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
wholly cast out of God's Favour, and never
received to Mercy again: and some Other Fathers,
as St <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Prosper,</hi> question his Salvation.
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Pererius</hi> positively conclude he was
damned; but then we find<note n="1" place="bottom">Pineda, Salianus, Drexellius.</note> three others of that
Communion and of the same Order peremptorily
asserting the contrary. <hi>Maldonate</hi> declares he
doth not know what to determine. Of which
Mind it seems was that Archbishop of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But, to wave the Opinions and Censures of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Persons at present, it is generally the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> that <hi>Solomon</hi> repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and was saved. And there are such Reasons
as these to induce us to believe it; 1. There is no
absolute concluding from the Greatness of his Sins

his hearty Repentance and Turning unto God are
recorded, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13, 19. Yea, <hi>David, Solomon</hi>'s

Sins of Studied <hi>Murder</hi> (which we do not find his

<hi>the walking in the Way of</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Solomon is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd

Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> (as hath been suggested alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy)
is a plain Testimony of his Repentance. Here
he bewails his former Follies, here he makes a

Text, (though that is not necessary, for it is
not any where recorded that <hi>Lot</hi> repented of his
Incest, or that some Others, whose Salvation we
question not, were heartily sorry for their Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages)
yet there is ground to believe his Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
not only from what hath been said, but from
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:46315:661"/>
what we are able further to alledg. 5. Therefore
we must consider that this Inspired Secretary of
the Holy Spirit was of the Number of the <hi>Prophets,</hi>
concerning whom our Infallible Teacher saith, that
<hi>they are all in the Kingdom of God,</hi> Luke 13. 28. It
is not to be question'd but that those <hi>Prophets</hi> who
were made use of by God in so Extraordinary a
manner as to be <hi>Sacred Writers</hi> of the Bible, were
all admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven, and are
placed in the Mansions of Glory. Besides, such
Persons as these, <hi>who spake as they were moved by the
Holy Ghost,</hi> are pronounced <hi>Holy Men of God</hi> by St.
<hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Ep, ch. 1. v. 21. None had that Honour
but those who were of Real Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ctity, i. e. <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
of Scripture</hi> (which he speaks of in that place)
was vouchsafed to none but such. And therefore
though <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Repentance be not expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
yet when we know that he was one of the
most Eminent <hi>Penmen</hi> of the Sacred Scripture, we
have Reason to think, that notwithstanding God
suffer'd him for a time to fall into those scandalous
Sins, yet he return'd afterwards to him by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned
Repentance, and was Renewed and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and died a Holy and Righteous Person.
6. This is evident from that Promise which God
made to <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 15. <hi>My Mercy shall not
depart away from him.</hi> Which is commented upon
by the wise Son of <hi>Sirach,</hi> (speaking of this King's
Follies and Extravagancies, and the sad Events of
them) <hi>The Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>will never leave off his
Mercy, neither shall any of his Works perish, neither
will he abolish the Posterity of his Elect, and the Seed of
him that loveth him he will not take away,</hi> Ecclesiastic.
47. 22. Whence we may rationally gather, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
was not cast off by God, but still continued
in his Favour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="397" facs="tcp:46315:661"/>Some argue from his Name<note n="1" place="bottom">qu. Recollectus, Receptus, sc. in favorem Dei.</note> 
                        <hi>Agur,</hi> which they
say implies his former Failings, and his being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed.
Others think his Name <hi>Iedidiah, Beloved
of the Lord,</hi> is a good Intimation that he became a
True Penitent, and was saved. And some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that because he was a <hi>Type</hi> of the Blessed
<hi>Iesus,</hi> he could not miscarry. But, whether these
have any Weight or no, I am confident no conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Person can deny the Force of the Reasons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
alledged. We may from them alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that <hi>Solomon</hi> was not finally rejected by God,
yea that he was upon his hearty Repentance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into Favour, and is now in the Number of
the Blessed. And this was the Judgment of those
Antient and Learned Writers of the Church,

                        <hi>Cyril.</hi> Let us
then forget his Faults when we study his Books,
wherein it is certain there are no <hi>Errata</hi>'s, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Interpreter of the Holy Ghost unto us, and
when he utter'd these things being a Friend and
Favourite of God. But suppose we knew certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(which we do not, and cannot, but have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ground for the contrary) that he was at last
cast off, yet I do not see how this doth necessarily
invalidate his Writings. God might, if he pleas'd,
make use of a Bad Man to pen some Part of the
Bible, as he thought fit to call <hi>Iudas</hi> to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stleship,
and to be an Eminent Preacher of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
Therefore though we should grant that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
was an Apostate, yet this is no direct Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the Validity and Authority of his
Writings. But there being such great Probability,

an hundred Years before it came to pass.
But his Predictions concerning the <hi>Messias</hi> are the

most remarkable of all: He in plain Terms <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not only the Coming of <hi>Christ</hi> in the Flesh,

reading of this Book then we read the Gospel it

Captivity of the Kingdom of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and after
that the total Destruction of the Kingdom of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
and of the Temple. Part of this famous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
yea most of it was after the <hi>Captivity of

things of great Worth and Moment: for here wefind
this Divine Prophet laying open the Sins of
the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> with an unparallell'd Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Boldness, and reminding them of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Judgments which had befallen the ten Tribes
for the very same Offences and Miscarriages. Here
this Weeping Prophet, this <hi>Iewish Heraclitus,</hi> most
passionately laments the miserable Condition which
they were plunging themselves into, and withal
directs them how to prevent it, namely, by a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
reforming of their Lives. But at last he more
peremptorily proclaims God's Wrath and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
against them, foreseeing and foretelling the
Grievous Calamities which were approaching, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the Seventy Years Captivity in <hi>Chaldaea,</hi>
which began (as some think) with the carrying

their happy Return and Deliverance, and likewise
the Just Recompence which <hi>Babylon, Moab,</hi> the

in the Kingdom of <hi>Israel</hi> in the Days of <hi>Vzziah,
Iotham, Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and
of <hi>Iaroboam</hi> King of <hi>Israel:</hi> so that he was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
with <hi>Isaiah,</hi> as appears from the first
Verses of both Prophecies. He directs his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
wholly against the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> which
consisted of the Ten Tribes, but is by him peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
stiled sometimes <hi>Ioseph,</hi> sometimes <hi>Ephraim,</hi>

as, on the other hand, the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> is
call'd by him <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
His main Design and Business through the whole
Book is to set forth the gross Idolatry and other
flagitious Practices of that degenerate People, and
to denounce the Judgments of God against them,
and particularly to foretel their Captivity in <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
and withal to excite them to a due Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this Severity of God towards them, and
thereby to beget an unfeigned Remorse and Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in them, that they may obtain the Pardon of
their Sins, and partake of the Divine Mercy and
Favour. All which is done with a most ravishing
Ardency, Affection and Zeal. As to the Stil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
indeed, it may be observ'd, that as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was the
Obscurest of the <hi>Greater Prophets,</hi> so <hi>Hosea</hi> is of
these <hi>Minour ones:</hi> but this Obscurity and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
are countervailed by that Rich Treasure which
are hid under them, and which will prove an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

Reward to those who search into it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
themselves with the transcendent Excellency
both of the <hi>Stile</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> of this Writer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ioel</hi> prophesied in the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> before
the time of the Captivity, though the particular
Time is not (as in most of the other Prophets)
mentioned. But 'tis probable he prophesied at the
same time with <hi>Hosea,</hi> who is set immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. So St. <hi>Ierom, Theodoret, Augustine,</hi> and
other Fathers think. He foretelleth the coming
up of a <hi>Northern Army, viz.</hi> from <hi>Babylon,</hi> which
is North of <hi>Iudea:</hi> Though some interpret it of
an <hi>Army of Locusts</hi> and <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> and other such
mischievous and devouring Insects mentioned <hi>ch. 1.
v. 4, &amp;c.</hi> and consequently the Prophet predicteth
the horrid <hi>Devastation, Dearth</hi> and <hi>Famine</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi>
which should be caused by them. I am for joining
both these Interpretations together, for I see it is
the usual way of the Holy Ghost in the Scriptures
(especially the <hi>Prophetick</hi> ones) to express two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Things and Occurrences by the same Words.
Here is then a double Army spoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> that
of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> which in a short time afterwards
invaded <hi>Iudea,</hi> and laid it waste; and also that of
<hi>Noxious Vermin,</hi> which was to be sent as a just Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
and Infliction for their Abuse of the Fruits of
the Earth, and the great Plenty which they had
enjoy'd. Whereupon he most warmly stirs them
up to <hi>Repentance;</hi> and to that Purpose enjoineth a
<hi>Fast,</hi> and urgeth them to a strict Observance of it
from the Hopes of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rcy</hi> and <hi>Forgiveness,</hi> and the
Removal of all those <hi>Iudgments</hi> which they labour
under, yea from the Expectation, or rather the
Assurance of a <hi>Blessing</hi> upon the whole Church.
This is briefly, but most admirably set forth by
this Man of God. And as it refers to that direful
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:46315:667"/>
Judgment of Famine and Destroying the Fruits of
the Earth, it may be made use of as a Seasonable
<hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of Devotion and Behaviour in the
time of such a Calamity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Amos,</hi> who in his Youth had been a <hi>Herdsman</hi> in
<hi>Tekoa,</hi> (a little Country-Town a Mile and a half
off of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) is now sent to <hi>the Kine of Bashan,</hi>
the People of <hi>Samaria,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> to
reduce them to Repentance and Reformation of
Life. To which end he boldly remonstrates against
the Crying Sins which were visible among them,
but especially against <hi>Idolatry, Oppression, Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and <hi>Incorrigibleness.</hi> He spares not those of
<hi>Iudah,</hi> but frankly reproves them for their <hi>Carnal
Security, Sensuality, Injustice, Confident Boasting.</hi>
And he scares both of them with frequent <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi>
and <hi>Menaces,</hi> and is not afraid to tell them
that their persisting in their Sins will end at last in
the Ruine of the Kingdoms of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Israel;</hi>
which he confirms and illustrates by the <hi>Visions</hi> of
a <hi>Plumb-line,</hi> and of a <hi>Basket of Summer-Fruit.</hi> It
is further observable in this Prophecy, that as it
begins with Denuntiations of Judgment and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
against the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>Philistines,</hi> the <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
and other Enemies of the Church, so it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
with comfortable Promises of restoring the
Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> and erecting the Kingdom
of <hi>Christ.</hi> He prophesied in the Days of <hi>Vzziah</hi>
King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Ioash</hi> (to
distinguish him from the other of that Name, who
was Son of <hi>Nebat</hi>): so that he flourish'd at the same
time with <hi>Hosea</hi> and <hi>Ioel.</hi> But there is <hi>some</hi> Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
as to the time, for 'tis added, <hi>[two Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                        <hi>Obadiah</hi>'s Prophecy is contain'd in one single
Chapter, and is partly a Divine Invective against
the merciless <hi>Edomites,</hi> who mocked and derided
the Captive <hi>Israelites</hi> as they passed to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
who, with other Enemies (their Confederates) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
and wronged these poor Strangers, and
made a great Ravage, and divided the Spoil among
them: and it is partly a Prediction of the Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Salvation of <hi>Israel,</hi> and of the Victory
and Triumph of the whole <hi>Church</hi> over all her
Enemies. Some think this <hi>Obadiah</hi> was he that was
King <hi>Ahab</hi>'s <hi>Steward,</hi> who <hi>hid the Prophets:</hi> then
'tis certain he was before these <hi>Other Prophets.</hi> But
there is no Foundation for this. We may rather
adhere to St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Opinion, who goes upon this
Rule, that when the time of the Prophecy is not
mention'd, it is to be referr'd to the same time
that the preceding Prophecy was writ in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ionah</hi>'s Prophecy was directed to the <hi>Ninevites,</hi>
as <hi>Obadiah</hi>'s to the <hi>Edomites,</hi> and relates how that
Prophet being commanded by God to go to <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh,</hi>
but disobediently travelling another way, was
discover'd by a sudden <hi>Tempest</hi> arising, and was cast
into the Sea, and swallowed by a <hi>Whale,</hi> which,
after it had lodged him three Nights and three
Days in its Belly, disgorged him upon the dry
Land. Whereupon being made sensible of his
past Danger, and of his Miraculous Deliverance
from it, he betook himself to that Journey and
Embassy which were first appointed him; and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at that Great City, the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of all <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi>
he, according to his Commission, boldly laid
open to the Inhabitants their manifold Sins and
Miscarriages, and proclaim'd their sudden Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
if they repented not. Upon which the
whole City, by <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Fasting,</hi> and <hi>Humbling</hi>
                        <pb n="410" facs="tcp:46315:668"/>
themselves, and by Turning from the Evil of their
Ways most happily averted the Divine Vengeance,
and prevented their Ruine. A most Admirable
Instance of the Divine Mercy! A Rare Example
of Universal Repentance, and that even in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
Country! Happy had the <hi>Ninevites</hi> been if
they had not relapsed afterwards. Nor is <hi>Ionab</hi>'s
unseasonable <hi>Repining</hi> at this Dispensation of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
omitted here by him, or by whoever it was
that wrote this Remarkable History; wherein we
see the Integrity of the Inspired Writers, which
is such, that they are not backward to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to the World their own greatest Failings, or
those which the best Men are incident to. <hi>Ionah</hi>
prophesied at the same time with the foregoing
Prophets, as <hi>Ierom</hi> concludes; and he is back'd by
other <hi>Fathers,</hi> as <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Eus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Micah</hi> prophesied in the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the same Kings
Reigns that the preceding Prophets did, as appears
from the first Verse. He impartially reprehends
the Great and Rampant <hi>Vices</hi> both of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
and <hi>Samaria,</hi> and is terrible in his Denuntiations
of <hi>Iudgments</hi> against both Kingdoms, but more
particularly he foretels the approaching Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> Yet he leaves not the Church
without Comfort, for he expresly foretels the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
of her Enemies, the <hi>Messias</hi>'s blessed Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
and with him the Peace and Prosperity, the
Increase and Advancement, the Glory and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
of the Church. So that <hi>Micah</hi> seems to be
<hi>Isaiah</hi> epitomized, giving us that in brief which
the other more largely and amply insisted on. And
it may be observ'd that these two Prophets are alike
in their Stile and manner of Speaking, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sublime and towering.</p>

                        <hi>Nahum</hi> prophesied after the carrying captive of
the Ten Tribes, a little before the Captivity of
the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah.</hi> His Prophecy is rightly
call'd a <hi>Burden,</hi> that Word both in the Greater and
Lesser Prophets importing the denouncing of some
Grievous and Heavy <hi>Iudgment:</hi> and such is this
which he here threatens to <hi>Ninev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this People returned to their former evil Ways af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Ionah</hi>'s Preaching; and for this Reason another
Prophet is sent to foresignify their Overthrow by
the Chaldeans upon this their Relapse into their
former Sins. He useth no kind Invitations to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
as the former Messenger did, but he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
and peremptorily proclaims their <hi>Ruine,</hi>
and with a most passionate and melting Eloquence
(such as is not to be parallell'd in the most Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Masters of Oratory) deciphers the horrid
Nature of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Habakkuk</hi> prophesied in King <hi>Ahaz</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s
Reigns, as <hi>Theodoret, Epiphanius,</hi> and others of the
Antients, probably determine; and not after the
Captivity of the Two Tribes, as <hi>Ierom</hi> thinks, for
this was not past when this Prophet writ, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
from <hi>chap. 1. v. 6. Lo, I raise up the Chaldeans,
who shall march through the Breadth of the Land,</hi> &amp;c.
He complains of the Corrupt State of the <hi>Iews</hi> in
those times, predicting the Invasion of the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
as the just Recompence of their Misdoings.
This is remarkable in this Prophecy (which we
find not in any of the rest) that it is composed in
way of a <hi>Dialogue.</hi> First, the Prophet speaks,
<hi>chap. 1. v.</hi> 1, to the <hi>4th:</hi> then God answereth, <hi>v.</hi> 5,
to the <hi>11th.</hi> The Prophet replies, <hi>v.</hi> 12, to the
<hi>17th:</hi> God's Answer is in <hi>chap.</hi> 2, to the End. Then
follows the Prophet's <hi>Prayer.</hi> The <hi>Providence</hi> of
God in suffering the Best Men to be miserably
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:46315:669"/>
treated, and that by the Worst and Vilest, is here
vindicated; and the Certainty of a <hi>Happy Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is assured. The Prophet also by propounding
the Example of his own Singular <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
in the greatest Difficulties and Extremities, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth
the Pious to wait on God, to rejoice in
him, and to expect Deliverance from their Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and Revenge on their Enemies in due time.
The whole was designed to be a Support and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
to the Faithful in the time of their Captivity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> who was employed in the Prophetick
Office in King <hi>Ios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

little after the Captivity of the Ten Tribes, and
before that of <hi>Iudah,</hi> (so that he was Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
with <hi>Ieremiah</hi>) freely and plainly tells the
Jews what it was that incensed God's Wrath
against them, <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Contempt of his Service,</hi>
their <hi>Apostacy,</hi> their <hi>Treachery,</hi> their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> their
<hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Rapine,</hi> and other egregious Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which were observable in them and their
Princes. Such high Provocations as these rendred
their Destruction <hi>terrible, universal, unavoidable.</hi>
And then (as most of the Prophets are wont) he
mingles <hi>Exhortations</hi> to Repentance as the only
Proper Concern in these Circumstances. He adds
very severe <hi>Comminations</hi> against their Enemies,
and presageth their Downfal. He likewise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
the Godly with <hi>Promises</hi> of the certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation
of the Church, of a Release from all their
former Pressures and Grievances, of a Cessation
from all their Fears, of the Continuance of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Presence and Blessing. So that this short Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy
contains in it all the Others, and may justly
be said to be an Abridgment of them.</p>

from the Captivity, and he was sent to the
Jews on the same Message, <hi>i. e.</hi> to check them for
their Backwardness in erecting the Temple, and
restoring the Divine Worship, but especially for
the Disorder of their Lives and Manners, which
could not but derive a Curse upon them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he exhorts them to seek the Lord, and to turn
from their evil Ways, and thereby to conciliate
and obtain the Favour of God. By several Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Visions</hi> and <hi>Types</hi> he endeavours to confirm their
Faith, and establish their Assurance concerning
<hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Presence</hi> with them and <hi>Care</hi> of them, yea
and of his <hi>Whole Church</hi> to the World's End: and
as a Proof and Demonstration of this he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperseth
the most comfortable Promises of the
<hi>Coming,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Priesthood,</hi>
the <hi>Victory,</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Christ the Branch.</hi> Nor
doth he forget to assure them of the Ruine of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
which had been their implacable Enemy. And
here likewise is foretold the Great Number of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
to the Christian Faith, the successful Spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Propagating of the Gospel, the wonderful
Efficacy of the Holy Spirit in those Days, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:46315:670"/>
of the Unbelieving Jews, the utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction

by the Romans, for their rejecting and crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Messias,</hi> and other particular things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing

                        <hi>Malachi</hi> is the last of these Prophets, yea of all

when <hi>Zachary, Simeon, Mary, Elizabeth,

He prophesied about 300 Years before our Saviour's
time, reproving the Jews for their Ungrateful and
Wicked Living after their Return from <hi>Babylon:</hi>
particularly he chargeth them with <hi>Rebellion, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
Adultery, Profaneness, Infidelity,</hi> but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
he reprehends the <hi>Priests</hi> for being Careless and
Scandalous in their Ministry, which one thing was
sufficient to give Authority to others to be Vicious.
At the same time he forgets not to take notice of

St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> had what they wrote from
the relation of others. Particularly St. <hi>Mark,</hi> who
was St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Companion, composed his Gospel
by his Order and Direction, and with his especial
Approbation, saith <hi>Eusebius.</hi> Again, it is to be
observ'd that tho every Evangelist relates nothing
but the Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet no one of them relates the
Whole Truth concerning Christ's Life and Actions.
Tho the Substance of the Gospel be contain'd in
every one of these Writers, yet some Particulars
are found in one that do not occur in another:
which makes it necessary to consult them all, and
to compare them together. As for St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> we may take notice that they do not
always observe the Order of Time, and the true

other two Evangelists, they are very punctual, and
inviolably observe the Order of things as they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
excepting only that <hi>Parenthesis</hi> (for such it
is) in <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 19, 20. concerning <hi>Herod.</hi> Of all

of things: which he himself takes notice of

Vnderstanding of all things, from the very first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to

be ample, and more methodical in the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
or <hi>History</hi> than the rest, yet he is but brief in
relating things that our Saviour did till the last
Year of his Preaching, St. <hi>Matthew</hi> having been
full in them: and in some other things he hath
need of a supply from the rest of the Evangelists,
and more especially from St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> whose Gospel
(from the Beginning of the <hi>14th</hi> Chapter to the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:46315:672"/>
End of the <hi>17th</hi>) contains those Excellent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of our Saviour before his Passion, which
were wholly omitted by the other Evangelists. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that, this Evangelist, in the Entrance into his
Gospel, is more Sublime and Soaring than the
rest, (and for that Reason is represented by an
<hi>Eagle</hi>) asserting the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ against the
bold <hi>Hereticks</hi> of that time, who openly confronted
that Doctrine. And in other Places of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
he hath a Peculiar Strain and Excellency,
which<note n="1" place="bottom">Coll. Mensal.</note> 
                        <hi>Luther</hi> expresses thus, after his plain way,
<hi>Every Word in</hi> John <hi>weigheth two Tuns.</hi> Concerning
the <hi>Evangelists</hi> I may note this, that though they
do not all of them set down the very <hi>individual
Words</hi> that Christ or others spake, (for we see that
sometimes one represents them in Terms different
from the rest) yet those that do not so, deliver al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the <hi>Sense</hi> of what was said; and even that
was dictated by the Holy Spirit, which is sufficient.
And concerning St. <hi>Iohn</hi> particularly I remark
this, that seeing he was the last of all the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
<hi>i. e.</hi> he wrote his Gospel last, it is rational
upon that Account to interpret the other Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists
by him, namely, where any Doubt or Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy
arises: for he having perused the other Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
and observ'd what Exceptions unbelieving
Men had made against any Passages in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
it is not to be doubted but that he expresses
himself with greater Plainness and Perspicuity
where those Matters are concern'd. This the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
and observant Reader will find to be true
if he consults the respective Places.</p>
                     <p>It is endless to give a Particular and Distinct Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
of every one of the Evangelists Writings. This
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:46315:672"/>
only can be said here, (in pursuance of our grand
Undertaking) that these Books are the Choicest
History that ever were committed to Writing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they contain the <hi>Birth,</hi> the <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Actions,</hi>
the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>Miracles,</hi> the <hi>Sufferings,</hi> the <hi>Death,</hi>
the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> the <hi>Ascension</hi> of our <hi>Lord IESVS
Christ,</hi> our most Compassionate Saviour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer:
All of which are the most Stupendous
and Amazing, as well as the most Necessary Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
to be known in the whole World. If this
brief and summary Account of the <hi>Gospels</hi> be not
sufficient to recommend them to our Studies and
Meditations, and to beget in us the utmost Esteem
of them, nothing more largely said will ever be
able to do it.</p>
                     <p>To the <hi>Historical</hi> Part of the New Testament
belong the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> wherein there is an
Account given of what all the <hi>Apostles</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in, <hi>viz.</hi> their choosing <hi>Matthias</hi> into <hi>Iudas</hi>'s
room, their Meeting together on the Day of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at which time they were all inspired by the
<hi>Holy Ghost</hi> (according to Christ's Promise) visibly
descending upon them, their <hi>Determinations</hi> in the
<hi>Council</hi> held at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> with their <hi>Letters</hi> which
they sent to the Churches abroad, and several
other things in which the Apostles were jointly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested.
This Book contains also the History of
the <hi>first Founding</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> of its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<hi>Progress</hi> and <hi>Success,</hi> especially among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
of the <hi>Opposition</hi> and <hi>Persecution</hi> it encountred
with, of the Undaunted <hi>Courage</hi> of the Apostles,
of the <hi>Course of their Ministry,</hi> of their <hi>Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Conferences, Apologies, Prayers, Sermons, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
Discipline, Church-Government, Miracles.</hi> Here
we are informed what were the <hi>Vsages</hi> of the first
Apostolical Ages: In a word, here we may find

the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> All which are
plain Evidences of the singular Usefulness, Worth
and Excellency of this Book. But it is chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the Acts and Atchievements of those most
Eminent Apostles St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul:</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
and most largely here are related the <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Travels, Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of these; for St. <hi>

all along, and well acquainted with whatever
he did, and whatsoever happen'd to him, gives
us the fullest Narrative of this Apostle. The
whole Book is a History of about forty Years,
namely, from Christ's Ascension<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to the second
Year of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Imprisonment at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>New Testament</hi> consists likewise of several
<hi>Epistles of the Apostles;</hi> which are Pious Discourses,
occasionally written more fully to explain and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Holy Doctrine which they had delivered,
to confute some growing Errors, to compose Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
and Schisms, to reform Abuses and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
to stir up the Christians to Holiness, and
to incourage them against Persecutions. For the
Apostles having converted several Nations to the
Faith, when they could not visit them in Person,
wrote to them, and so supplied their Presence by
these <hi>Epistles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To begin with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epistles,</hi> they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
either to <hi>Whole Churches, viz.</hi> of <hi>Believing Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
(i. e.</hi> the greatest Part of them were such,
tho some of <hi>Iewish</hi> Race might be mix'd among
them) as the Epistles to the <hi>Romans, Corinthians,
Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians;</hi>
or of <hi>Believing Iews</hi> wholly, as the Epistle
to the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> Or they were written to <hi>Particular
Persons,</hi> as the Epistles to <hi>Timothy, Titus, Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="421" facs="tcp:46315:673"/>
The Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi> is made up of several
Profound Discourses on such Subjects as these, the
Prerogatives of the <hi>Iews,</hi> their Rejection notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
those Prerogatives, the Wonderful Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
of God towards the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Nature
of the Law, Justification by Faith alone, Election
and Free Grace, the Conflict between the Flesh and
Spirit, Christian Liberty, Scandal, the Use of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the chief thing which
he designs in this Epistle, is to shew, that neither
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by the Law of Nature, nor the <hi>Iews</hi>
by that of <hi>Moses,</hi> could attain to Righteousness and
Justification, and consequently Salvation; but that
these are to be obtained only by Faith in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
for whose Merits alone we are accounted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in the Sight of God. And then, to shew that
this Faith is not separated from Good Works, he
addeth Exhortations to the Practice of Holiness,
Obedience of Life, and a Religious Conversation.
So that this Epistle is both Doctrinal and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
it directs us in our Notions and in our Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
It decides some of the greatest Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
and withal it informs us about the most indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable
Offices of Christianity.</p>
                     <p>The next Epistles are to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
the chief City of <hi>Peloponne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

the <hi>Morea.</hi> And <hi>Cenchrea</hi> (which you read of,
<hi>Rom. 16. 1. Acts 19. 18.)</hi> was the Station of Ships
for this maritime City, but was a distinct Town
from it. To the Converted Inhabitants of this
great Metropolis, (famed for its Wealth, and
therefore sirnamed <hi>the Rich,</hi> as <hi>Thucydides</hi> saith)
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>to all the Saints in</hi> Achaia the Apostle here
writes. His <hi>first Epistle</hi> to them is against the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:46315:674"/>
Perswasions and Vicious Practices which he
observ'd among them at that time. His Design
was to reform them as to their Schisms and Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
their Idolatrous Communion, their Unseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Habits, their Confusions and Disorders in their
Assemblies, their Prophaning the Lord's Supper,
their Toleration of Incest, and the like scandalous
Behaviour. Besides, there are other considerable
Matters which he treats of, as Marriage, Divorce,
Virginity, eating of Meats sacrificed to Idols,
Christian Liberty, going to Law before Heathens,
Church-Discipline, Ministers Maintenance, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Gifts, especially the Gift of Prophesying, <hi>&amp;.</hi>
Some particular Cases concerning which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
with great Plainness and Dexterity, and may
be serviceable to determine our Judgments in all
Cases of the like Nature. He also admirably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scants
on the Nature and Necessity of Charity, and
he by multiplied Arguments asserts the Doctrine
of the Resurrection.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had received this <hi>First Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi>
and as soon as the Apostle was informed by
<hi>Titus</hi> what Reformation it had wrought in them,
he writ a <hi>Second</hi> to them, in Defence of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
and Apostleship, against some that labour'd to
bring him into Contempt among them. He
threatens Offenders, he encourages the Obedient,
he animates the Faint-hearted, he confounds his
Antagonists, and that by a new way of Argument,
<hi>viz.</hi> by boasting of his <hi>Sufferings,</hi> and giving a full
Inventory of them. He displays his Calamities,
he blazons his Crosses; and Victories and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
do not more elevate others than these do
him. He excellently discovers the hypocritical
Pretences of False Prophets, he vindicates his own
Person and Authority, he answers the Calumnies
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:46315:674"/>
and Aspersions of Erroneous Teachers, he clears
himself from the Imputation of Levity, Pride,
Vain-Glory, Severity, and other things laid to his
Charge: He asserts the Truth of his Doctrine, and
the Laudableness of his Actions, and exhorts to all
Holiness and Righteousness of Life. But the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Part of this Epistle is <hi>Apologetical:</hi> whence we
learn, that it is not unseemly or unchristian to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
on one's own Actions and Sufferings when
there is a necessary Occasion.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Galatians (i. e.</hi> the Christian
Brethren in <hi>Galatia,</hi> a Region in the Lesser <hi>Asia,</hi>
call'd also <hi>Gallo-Graecia,</hi> because it was of old inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by Gauls and Greeks) is directed against the
False Apostles among them, who mingled the Law
with the Gospel, Legal Works with Faith, and
made the former necessary to Justification Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he again asserts the Doctrine of Justification
by Faith; so that this Part of the Epistle is a brief
Summary of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Romans.</hi> He proves,
that these <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts need not become Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> nor observe the Law of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
or any other Mosaick Rite. But he
tells them the right Use of Circumcision and of the
Law, and bids them stand fast in the Evangelical
Liberty, and be careful that they do not abuse it,
but walk in Love and Meekness, Humility, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
and Charity, which are the Great and Noble
Vertues that are to shine in the Lives of Christians.
It is easily observable that the Apostle is more
Warm and Vehement in this Epistle than in any of
his others; the Reason of which is, because he saw
his <hi>Galatians</hi> so greatly endanger'd by their listning
to the perverse Reasonings of the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> (as some
think) or other <hi>Iudaizing</hi> Teachers that were
crept in among them, and were perswading them
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:46315:675"/>
to imbrace <hi>another Gospel,</hi> to di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>own and reject the
Principles which he had taught them, and to come
off from <hi>Christianity</hi> to <hi>Iudaism.</hi> This kindles a
holy Indignation in his Breast, and makes him with
an unwonted Keenness and Severity cry out against
them, and complain of their gross <hi>Folly,</hi> yea their
wilful suffering themselves to be <hi>bewitched</hi> and <hi>infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated</hi>
by those Impostors.</p>
                     <p>His Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians, i. e.</hi> the faithful
Christians of <hi>Ephesus</hi> the Head-City of <hi>Asia</hi> the
Less, (which was written from <hi>Rome</hi> when he was
a Prisoner there) divinely sets forth the Great and
Astonishing Mystery of our Redemption and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
the Freeness and Riches of Grace in
Christ Jesus, the Admirable Benefits and Privileges
of the Gospel, the Marvelous Dispensation of God
to the Gentiles in revealing Christ to them, the
Excellency and Dignity of his Apostolick Charge.
He adds most Pathetick Exhortations to Constancy
in the Faith, notwithstanding the Calumnies of
False Teachers, and the Peril of the Cross. He
propounds the most Cogent Motives to Love and
Unity: he urgeth the conscientious Performance
of all the Duties of Religion, and gives Particular
Rules and Precepts for the discharging of every
Christian Office; so admirable, so Entire, so Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
is this Part of the Apostle's Writings.</p>
                     <p>The Epistle to the <hi>Philippians (i. e.</hi> the Christians
of <hi>Philippi,</hi> a City of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and a <hi>Roman</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony)
was writ also when the Apostle was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
at <hi>Rome:</hi> and in it he thanks them for their
Liberality towards him in his Bonds, and for their
sending <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> (their Minister) with a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of Money to him. This Epistle is chiefly writ
to them in return to this seasonable Kindness of
theirs, and (as that to the Galatians was the Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:46315:675"/>
so this) is the Smoothest and Sweetest, the
most Endearing and Pathetick of all St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and is fullest of Paternal Affection. He here
likewise takes notice of and extols their Profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
in the Gospel, and then labours to confirm
them in it: he exhorts them to Increase and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
in the Christian Faith, to bear their Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
with Patience and Constancy of Mind, to be
Humble and Peaceable, and to be Loving to one
another. He cautions them against Seducers and
False Teachers, who bad them rely on the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>sness
of the Law;</hi> and on the contrary assures them.
that their only Trust and Dependance ought to be
on <hi>the Righteousness which is of God by Faith in Christ
Iesus.</hi> He earnestly beseecheth them to be Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
in their Conversations, and to live in the
Practice of all Christian Duties. He lovingly and
passionately Salutes them, and Prays for them: he
is every where Obliging and Affectionate; in sum,
the whole Epistle is written with a Pen dipp'd in
Oil.</p>
                     <p>In the Epistle to the <hi>Colossians</hi> (i. e. the People
of <hi>Colosse,</hi> a City in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> not far from <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eea</hi>
and <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> in the <hi>Proconsular Asia,</hi> who
were converted by the Preaching of <hi>Epaphras,</hi>
whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> had sent to them, but now is his
Fellow-Prisoner at <hi>Rome</hi>) the chief Design of the
Apostle is to Reduce those that were led away by
False Teachers, whether <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Philosophers.</hi> The
former introduced the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Ceremonies and
Observations the latter brought in Unsound No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Speculations, and both of them pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Simplicity and Purity of the Gospel. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostle endeavours to establish them in
the true Evangelical Doctrine, in opposition to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daism</hi>
and the <hi>Vain Deceits of Philosophy.</hi> He is ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:46315:676"/>
with them to adhere only to Christianity, and
to persevere in the Practice of all those Excellent
Precepts that belong to it. And accordingly first
he mentions some General, and then some Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Graces and Duties. This Epistle is of the same
<hi>Tenour, Subject,</hi> and even the same <hi>Expression</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
with that to the <hi>Ephesians:</hi> for the Apostle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
about the same time that he wrote to the Ephesians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
did so likewise to the Colossians, whilest the very
same things were still fresh in his Memory: whence
it is that he uses the same Words often to both.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>first Epistle to the Thessalonians</hi> (or rather
the <hi>Thessalonicians,</hi> for they were Inhabitants of
<hi>Thessalonica,</hi> the chief City of <hi>Macedony,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by St. <hi>Paul, Silas,</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi>) was writ
on the Occasion of the Persecutions which those
Christians felt from the <hi>Iews:</hi> and in it the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
after he had expressed his Joy for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
and Sincerity of Faith, exhorts them to
Constancy and Perseverance in his Doctrine, and
not to be discouraged by their Sufferings, but to
continue in the Practice of Holiness as well as in
the Profession of the Gospel. To encourage them
to which he reminds them of his Boldness, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
Sincerity, Affectionateness in preaching
the Gospel to them, and of his Present Care and
Concernedness for them. He gives several Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Precepts of Charity and Piety, and warns
them of Christ's Second Coming, of which he adds
a very Lively Description.</p>
                     <p>In his <hi>Second Epistle</hi> he corrects some Misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
which had been made by them of what
he had said in the <hi>first:</hi> For it seems they mistook
the Apostle concerning the <hi>Coming of Christ,</hi> as if
it were presently to happen, whereas (as he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
them) there must first be a Visible <hi>Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
                        <pb n="427" facs="tcp:46315:676"/>
and <hi>Declension</hi> from the <hi>Faith;</hi> and the <hi>Man of
Sin</hi> (whom he briefly delineates) must appear in
the World before that Day cometh. He heartens
and encourages them under their Sufferings, and
admonisheth them to continue in their Duty, from
the Consideration of the Certainty of Christ's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing:
he prays most ardently and affectionately
for them, and interchangeably craveth their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for him. These are the Choice and Admirable
Contents of these Epistles.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>first Epistle to Timothy</hi> there are many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
things treated of, namely, the Right
Use of the Law, Praying for all Mankind, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
modest Apparel, their Silence in the
Churches, the Apostacy of the latter times, the
Duty of Servants, the Gain of Godliness, the
Mischief of Covetousness, besides several other
Heads that are only glanced at. But the main
thing insisted and enlarged upon is <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Duty
as he was a <hi>Bishop,</hi> where we have an Excellent and
Compleat Character of a Faithful Ruler or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer
of the Church. Here he is directed how to
behave himself in that High Calling, how to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
all the Offices of that Sacred Function. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which Account this Epistle may justly be stiled
<hi>a Pastoral Letter,</hi> because it doth more immediately
concern those Persons who have the Charge of
Christ's Flock, and have the Honour to be Guides
and Instructers of Souls. Here they may be taught
all the Parts of their Ministerial Employment, here
they may furnish themselves with Exact Rules of
their Duty. This is the best <hi>Rubrick</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> for
this Purpose. Nor are there wanting particular
Instructions concerning the <hi>Deacons</hi> Office, and
concerning <hi>Elders.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="428" facs="tcp:46315:677"/>
And such is the <hi>Second Epistle,</hi> where in likewise
are farther Directions about the Office and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of an Evangelical Bishop: and he is exhorted
to all Vigilancy, Patience, Prudence, Faithfulness,
Diligence and Constancy in the Ministerial Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
notwithstanding the Labours and Afflictions
which accompany it, notwithstandi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>g the Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements,
Hardships and Sufferings which attend
the conscientious Discharge of it. Besides many
Other Things of great Moment there is inserted a
<hi>Prophecy</hi> concerning the Impious Seducers that
should come in the last Days, with a particular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of them.</p>
                     <p>The Epistle to <hi>Titus</hi> is of the same Nature with
those former ones, (especially the first to <hi>Timothy</hi>)
wherein he gives Directions how he ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean
himself as a true Evangelical Bishop or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor,
inserting the Lively Pourtraiture of such an
Officer in the Church. For which Reason it is more
peculiarly sitted for the Use of those who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
with that High Character in the Ministry of
the Church. But there are also Instructions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to those of another Rank, and to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in general; for they are enjoined to be <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Principalities and Powers,</hi> to <hi>live soberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously
and godlily,</hi> to <hi>maintain good Works,</hi> to <hi>avoid
foolish Questions</hi> and Controversies, and (in brief)
to behave themselves in their several Stations as it
becometh the Followers of Christ: So full, so large,
so pregnant is this Short Epistle.</p>
                     <p>The Epistle to <hi>Philemon</hi> was written by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
from <hi>Rome</hi> when he was in Prison, upon this
particular Occasion; <hi>Philemon,</hi> one of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Converts, and afterwards a Fellow-Labourer with
him in the Gospel, had a Servant who defrauded
him, and then ran away from him, and coming to
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:46315:677"/>
                        <hi>Rome</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was Prisoner there, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
by him; whereupon he sends him back
again to his Master with this Epistle, wherein he
desires <hi>Philemon</hi> to forgive his fugitive Servant,
and to be reconciled to him, and to receive him
again into his Service and Favour, and to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him as a Christian <hi>Brother</hi> rather than a Servant.
This the Apostle pursues with Expressions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Love and Compassion towards <hi>Onesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whom <hi>he had begotten in his Bonds,</hi> and with
great Tenderness and Affection to <hi>Philemon,</hi> who

that all the <hi>Legal Sacrifices</hi> were fulfill'd in

the Father for the Sins of the World. This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged

Light and Spirit as this Divine Penman was
Master of. This I may truly say, that this Part of
the Epistle to the Hebrews is the most illustrious
Confutation of the <hi>Socinian Heresy</hi> that is in the
whole New Testament. For here is plainly and
fully asserted the Efficacy of Christ's offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as a Sacrifice on the Cross for the expiating the
Sins of Mankind. In sundry Particulars this is most
demonstratively proved, that a Compleat and Full
Satisfaction was made unto God by his Death:

Doctrine: he with great Industry endeavours to
convince them of the Danger of <hi>Apostacy,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
them in the Christian Doctrine amidst all the
Persecutions and Difficulties they labour'd under.
And lastly, he is solicitous to prevent their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting
by setting before them the most Eminent
<hi>Examples</hi> of Faith and Patience. These are the
Momentous Themes which are observable in this
Epistle.</p>
                     <p>I know some have doubted whether this Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
Epistle be St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and others have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:46315:678"/>
denied that it is his, yet still allowing that
it was written by some Inspired Person, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Canon of Holy Scripture. The Learned
<hi>Grotius</hi> endeavours to prove that St. <hi>Luke</hi> wrote it.
But for my Part I have no Inclination to believe
that any other Person than St. <hi>Paul</hi> penn'd this
Epistle: for this is most clear from that one Place,
2 Pet. 3. 16. <hi>Even as our beloved Brother</hi> Paul <hi>also,
according to the Wisdom given unto him, hath written
unto you.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> here speaks to the <hi>Iews,</hi> for to
them this Epistle as well as the former was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
as appears from the Title of it,<note n="1" place="bottom">Chap. 1. v. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>To the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
scatter'd throughout</hi> Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
Asia, and Bithynia, <hi>i. e.</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> dispersed up and
down the World, who by St. <hi>iames</hi> are call'd<note n="2" place="bottom">Jam. 1. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>the
twelve Tribes which are scatter'd abroad.</hi> These, tho
they neither lived in <hi>Palestine,</hi> nor used the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Tongue, but lived among the Greeks, and
spoke that Language generally, and used the Greek
Bible, <hi>viz.</hi> the Translation of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> in
their Synagogues, and were commonly known by
the Name of <hi>Hellenists,</hi> and consequently were not
<hi>Hebrews</hi> or <hi>Iews</hi> in the strictest and properest Sense,
yet because they were of <hi>Iewish</hi> Parentage, and
professed, or had once professed the <hi>Iewish</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
they were still call'd <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and
accordingly have that Denomination here. So
that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here, and St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iames</hi>
write their Epistles to the same Persons, that is,
to the <hi>Converted Iews</hi> that were dispersed abroad,
especially in <hi>Greece:</hi> and, which is the Argument
I make use of at present, St. <hi>Peter</hi> particularly
takes notice of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Writing to these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed
Jews. But how doth it appear that he writ
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:46315:679"/>
to them? Thus all the Epistles of this Apostle
which we have mentioned before (excepting this
which we are now speaking of) were written ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Churches of <hi>believing Gentiles,</hi> or to some
<hi>Particular Persons</hi> (as hath been noted already):
whence it follows, that seeing he wrote to the <hi>Iews</hi>
or <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> testifies) he was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of this remaining Epistle which is inscribed to
<hi>them.</hi> We are certain that St. <hi>Paul</hi> writ to the
<hi>Iews,</hi> because St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us so, that is, he tell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
us that St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to those to whom he <hi>wrote<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
but St. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote to the <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Hebrews</hi> both his
Epistles, therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
and this Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> which we
now have, must be that very Epistle, because th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
is no other of his to them besides it. Wherefore
it is an undeniable Consequence that the <hi>Epistle to
the Hebrews</hi> was writ by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and by none else<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which was the thing to be proved. Again, I might
further add that what the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epistles,</hi> (or concerning the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> wherein so many <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,
Types, Allegories</hi> and <hi>Mysteries,</hi> are treated
of and applied: so that it may probably be inferr'd
hence, that this Epistle is referr'd to in particular,

it. To corrobate this, we may subjoin the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

attribute this Epistle to St. <hi>Paul:</hi> With whom
agree the <hi>Schoolmen;</hi> and all the Writers of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Erasmus</hi> and <hi>Cajetan,</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus
Vives,</hi> assert the same. Most of the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi>
are of this Opinion, though herein they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from their Master <hi>Luther;</hi> and the <hi>Reformed
Churches</hi> (as distinct from the <hi>Lutherans</hi>) are of the
same Perswasion, though <hi>Calvin</hi> be of another
Mind; which shews that there are very Cogent
Reasons for this Opinion, otherwise these Parties
would not dissent from their Masters. It may be
added, that Our <hi>English Church</hi> in the <hi>Title</hi> calls it
<hi>the Epistle of</hi> Paul <hi>the Apostle to the Hebrews.</hi> As for
the Reason of the Omission of his Name in the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi>
of this <hi>Epistle,</hi> (which is not to be observ'd
in his Others) perhaps it was (as <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,
Athanasius, Chrysostom, Theophilact,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture)
because his Name was odious to most of
the <hi>Iews,</hi> he having been once a <hi>Iews,</hi> but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
abandon'd that Religion; wherefore he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
left out his Name that it might not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
what he writ, and that the Epistle might not
be thrown away for the Author's sake. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this was the Reason why his Name is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
(as in the rest of his Epistles) I am not able
to determine: only I am sufficiently convinced,
from what St. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, that this Epistle was writ
by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> that single Testimony is Proof enough.</p>
                     <p>Here I might take occasion (having hitherto gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you a brief Account of the Excellent Matter of
this Apostle's Writings, which are so great a Part
of the New Testament) to speak something con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his <hi>Stile,</hi> or rather to add to what I have
already said of it in another Place, under this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<hi>There are no Solaecisms in the Holy Writings.</hi>
This I am the more willing to do, because some
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:46315:680"/>
have look'd upon this Apostle as a Man of no Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
yea scarcely of any Grammar and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency
of Sense: which Imputation would argue a
great Defect and Imperfection in Scripture, and
therefore I am obliged to take notice of it. It is
true, there are several things which render his
Stile somewhat dark and perplexed in sundry
Places. He brings in <hi>Objections</hi> sometimes, but
doth not intimate that the Words are spoken in
that way, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7. and other Places;
which makes the Sense difficult to those that do not
carefully examine the Context. In the <hi>4th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of that Epistle, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. a <hi>Negative</hi> is left out,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Answer to the preceding Question, which
should have been thus; <hi>No; he hath not found.</hi> And
in <hi>ver.</hi> 8. the Note of <hi>Parenthesis</hi> is omitted, as 'tis
in several other Places. Further, 'tis observable,
that the Apostle hath sometimes references to
Words and Things which he had mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but which he seem'd to have quite laid aside
in his Discourse. Thus he turns back again in
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. and refers to what was said before in
<hi>ver.</hi> 6. for those Words in the latter Place [<hi>The
Lord is that Spirit</hi>] refer to the former one, where
he speaks of <hi>the Spirit, i. e.</hi> the Gospel and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Dispensation, in contradistinction to <hi>the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
i. e.</hi> the Dispensation, of the Law. The Words
then I interpret thus, <hi>The Lord Christ is that Spirit,</hi>
he is the Blessed Author and Instituter of that Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
and Spiritual Oeconomy which we are now
under, and which brings true <hi>Liberty</hi> with it, as
he adds. Many Expositors labour to tack this
Text to the immediately foregoing one, but to
little purpose: for they thereby make the Sense
harsh and distorted, there being nothing there to
which this Passage refers. But by reducing these
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:46315:680"/>
Words to the <hi>6th</hi> Verse (as 'tis not unusual with
this Writer to allude to some certain Expression a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
a considerable Distance) the Sense of the Place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
very easy and intelligible, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ
Jesus our Blessed Lord is clearly exhibited in the
Gospel, and gives <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> with this Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Administration.</p>
                     <p>Again, it is true St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Stile is very full and
running over sometimes: his Pen is frequently in
a Career, and is not easily stopped. All that he
saith from the first Verse of the first Chapter of
the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> till you come to the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Verse, is but one single Period. And in
some other Places he spins out his Subject into a
Thread of almost the same Length. From this
Fulness of Matter it proceeds that he makes so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Excursions</hi> in his Writings, which seem some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to Persons who take no notice of his sudden
Transitions, to be very Incoherent. Thus when he
was proving the Dignity of Christ's Priesthood,
he undertakes to shew that he was a Priest after the
Order of <hi>Melchisedec, of whom,</hi> saith he, <hi>we have
many things to say,</hi> Heb. 5. 11. but yet he saith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of him till the seventh Chapter; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the fifth Chapter, and the whole sixth
being spent in a long Digression. But you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a far longer in his Epistle to the Romans,
chap. 3. v. 1, 2. <hi>What Advantage hath the Iew, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what Profit is there in Circumcision? Much every way,
chiefly because that unto them were committed the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of God.</hi> Where you see he begins to reckon
up the <hi>Advantages</hi> and <hi>Privileges</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> (and
therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as I conceive, should not be
translated <hi>chiefly,</hi> but <hi>first</hi>) and yet here he names
but One of them, for an <hi>Objection</hi> (which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes
to answer and enlarge upon) takes him off
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:46315:681"/>
for many Chapters together, and he returns not
again till <hi>ch. 9. v.</hi> 4. where he enumerates the rest
of the <hi>Privileges.</hi> And several other Instances might
be assigned of his launching out into Discourses
which seem to be foreign to his purpose, which
render his Stile somewhat abrupt, and his Sense in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate.
He had begun a Comparison, <hi>Rom. 5. 12.
As by one Man Sin entred,</hi> &amp;c. but then he strikes
in with a <hi>Parenthesis</hi> in the next Verse, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
him from finishing what he began till the <hi>18th</hi>
Verse, <hi>Even so by the Righteousness of one,</hi> &amp;c. Nay
rather, he forsakes the Comparison, and riseth
above it, finding the <hi>Grace in Christ Iesus</hi> rise high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the <hi>Condemnation</hi> that came by <hi>Adam.</hi>
Whereas he began with an [<hi>as</hi>], and should have
followed it with a [<hi>so</hi>], he turns this into a [<hi>much
more</hi>] <hi>v.</hi> 15, 17. and then at last comes about to
compleat the Comparison as he had first begun it,
v. 18. There is a plain <hi>Parenthesis</hi> from the <hi>1st</hi>
Verse to the <hi>7th</hi> in the first Chapter to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
There is another somewhat longer in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
which begins at <hi>v.</hi> 23. and lasts to the <hi>33d.</hi> So
in the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> ch. 3. when he had
said, <hi>For this Cause I</hi> Paul <hi>the Prisoner of Iesus Christ
for you Gentiles,</hi> V. 1. he presently runs into a <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi>
which continues till the <hi>14th</hi> Verse, where
he leaves off his Digression and proceeds, <hi>For this
Cause,</hi> &amp;c. Thus the Redundancy of his Matter
and Sense makes him interrupt himself, and lard
his Discourse with frequent Digressions, and divert
his Reader oftentimes from the present Subject he
is upon. But notwithstanding this, no Man that
is Master of any Eloquence himself, or understands
the Laws of it in others, can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself here out of Christian Modesty, as

Will any one say that he tells a Lie here, though
he was the Greatest Apostle, and one of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of Saints? Besides, he might not unjustly stile
himself <hi>rude in Speech</hi> in this respect, that he so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

conceal or disguise his Excellent Gift of expressing

himself in his Writings. He was certainly a Great
Master of Language and Discourse: and indeed we
could reasonably expect no other from his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which furnish'd him with all sorts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for as he was born at <hi>Tarsus,</hi> so it is likely
he was brought up in the same Place, which was

where he sat at the Feet of <hi>Gamaliel:</hi> so that he

It is a Mistake of some Learned Writers of very

In fine, no Tongue can express the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency

comprise in them all the Depths and Mysteries of

with many Florid and well Composed Periods, and
abound every where with a most Winning Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
with the Charms of a most Melting and

his Epistles his Warmest Blood seems to be the

                     <p>Besides St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epistles,</hi> which are fourteen in

<hi>Iude;</hi> all which (except the two latter of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>)
are call'd <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>General Epistles,</hi> because they

St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s <hi>Epistle</hi> was written to the Christian
Jews that dwelt in other Regions besides <hi>Iudea,</hi>
who consisted partly of the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> carried cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
by <hi>Salmanassar</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> who never,
that we read of, return'd again, and partly of the
<hi>Two Tribes,</hi> many of which still remain'd in Exile:
wherefore St. <hi>Iames</hi> sends this Epistle to the <hi>Twelve
Tribes scatter'd abroad.</hi> The two main things in it
are first concerning the Affictions and Persecutions
which were to be undergone for Christ's sake;
where he exhorts them to Patience under those
great Trials. Secondly, concerning the Necessity
of a Holy Life, where he shews them that Justifying
Faith must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Lives of Christians, especially of those that
are in Affliction and Adversity. Wherefore this

is of the same Nature with the first, exhorting the

Danger of Backstiding, he warns them against He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
Teachers and Profane Scoffers that should

He voucheth the Certainty of Christ's Coming to

of this Epistle is to urge a Godly and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Life, to convince those who are called by
Christ's Name of the Necessity of their walking
answerably to it. Indeed this Apostle was forced
(as St. <hi>Iames</hi> before was) to write on this subject,
to press Good Works and Outward Righteousness,
because some in those Days turned the Grace of
God into Licentiousness, making Faith exclude all
External Acts and Works of Holiness. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he offers several Plain <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Tokens</hi>
whereby they may certainly know whether they be
Real Christians, truly Religious, and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

with our Saviour himself (as the Evangelical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
inform us) to make his Applications to those
of this Sex, to cherish and commend their Vertues.
It is particularly recorded, that<note n="5" place="bottom">Acts 17. 4.</note>

few</hi> were St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Proselytes. And to descend
lower, we read that St. <hi>Ierom</hi> took great Pains in
instructing the <hi>Roman</hi> Ladies, and in commending
and incouraging their Study of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Yea, many of his Writings were directed
and dedicated to Noble Women, Widows and
Virgins, as <hi>Paula, Eustochium, Salvina, Celantia,</hi>
and several others that were Roman Ladies, and
of noble Extraction. Such is our <hi>Elect</hi> here, who
is the only Person of that Sex to whom an <hi>Inspired
Epistle</hi> is written. She is commended for her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
bringing up her Children, she is exhorted to
abide in the Doctrine of Christ, to perservere in
the Truth, and to be careful to avoid all Delusions
of False Teachers. But chiefly the Apostle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seecheth
this Noble Matron to practise the great
and indispensable Commandment of Christian
Love and Charity.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>third Epistle</hi> was writ to <hi>Gaius,</hi> a Converted
<hi>Iew, (or Gentile,</hi> as others think, because he hath
a <hi>Roman</hi> Name) a Man of a fair Estate, and who
had been very bountiful and hospitable to the
Saints. The Design of the Epistle is to own and
commend his Hospitality, especially his seasonable
Bene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that were Exiles for the Cause of Christianity, and
to stir him up to continue in the Exercise of the
same Charity and Liberality to the distressed Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
<hi>Demetrius</hi> is propounded as an eminent
Example of this, for which and all other Vertues
<hi>he had the good Report of all Men,</hi> yea <hi>and of the Truth
it self;</hi> that is, as he was spoken well of by every
one, so he really deserv'd it. On the other side,
he complains of the Uncharitable, Insolent and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
<hi>Diotrephes,</hi> a Prating Opposer not only of
him and his Doctrine, but of all the true Servants
of <hi>Iesus.</hi>

The <hi>General Epistle of Iude or Iudas,</hi> as we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it in <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 22. (it being the same Name
with that of the <hi>Traitor,</hi> for it is no unusual thing
for good and bad Men to have the same Names;
as in the Old Testament <hi>Eliab, Iehu, Hananiah,</hi> &amp;c.
in the New Testament <hi>Simon, Iohn, Ananias,</hi> are
Instances of this). This Epistle, I say, of this
Good Apostle with a Bad Man's Name was written
to all Christian Churches, or at least to all the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
Christians Dispersed;</hi> (the same to whom St.
<hi>Iames</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> wrote) wherein he exhorts
them to contend for the Faith, against those <hi>Dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Seducers</hi> that were at that time
crept into the Church, whose Erroneous Tenents

and from the Examples of God's Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on other Great Offenders infers the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of these Mens Ruine. In short, this Epistle
hath all the Marks of a true Apostolick Spirit, and
is of the same Argument with the second Epistle of
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and is a kind of Epitome of it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I need not be very Particular in rehearsing the
Contents.</p>
                     <p>The last Book of the <hi>New Testament</hi> is <hi>the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of St.</hi> John <hi>the Divine,</hi> which Epithet is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
given to him here, because of the Divinity
and Sublimity of his Raptures, because he (of all
the Apostles) had the greatest Communications of
Divine Mysteries. It may be referr'd either to
the <hi>Historical Books</hi> or to the <hi>Epistles;</hi> to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
because it is a Prophetick <hi>History</hi> of the State
of the Church from the Apostles times to the end
of the World: to the latter, because it is in the
Form of an <hi>Epistle,</hi> (after the three first Verses,
by way of Preface) <hi>viz.</hi> to the Seven Churches of
<hi>Asia,</hi> at first planted by, and now under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:46315:686"/>
of St. <hi>Iohn:</hi> and as it begins, so it ends

Concerning the precise time when St. <hi>Iohn</hi> receiv'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and when he wrote this <hi>Revelation,</hi> there is some
Dispute: but the most probable (if not the most
generally received) Opinion is, that he being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>

into <hi>Patmos</hi> (an Isle in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
about forty Miles from the Continent of
<hi>Asia</hi>) by Domitian, (under whom was the <hi>Second
persecution</hi>) this <hi>Revelation</hi> was deliver'd to him
about the middle of the Emperor's Reign, (but at
several times) and that he committed it to Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

themselves, I will not here particularly in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

any of them; only in general it is commonly said

Schisms and Persecutions afterwards, in the
times succeeding the Pagan Roman Emperors, <hi>viz.</hi>
under <hi>Papacy.</hi> And then the <hi>Vials</hi> tell what Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
befals the <hi>Papal Antichrist,</hi> and all the
Churches Enemies. So that the Seals, <hi>Trumpets</hi>
and <hi>Vials</hi> give an Account of the three Grand Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods
of the Church. There is great Probability
of this: but I must add, (and I will offer it to the
Reader as a thing necessary to be taken notice of
in order to the right understanding of this Book)
that the Order of Time and History is not always
observ'd here: things are not related constantly
in a certain continued Method and Series, nor are
we to understand or take them as written so. A
great and prevailing <hi>Mistake</hi> it hath been to think
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:46315:686"/>
that the Course and Order of Time are duly and
all along observ'd in these Writings. Whereas to
a considerate Person it will appear that there is no
such thing, and that the Chapters are not writ and
disposed in any Method.</p>
                     <p>This, because it may be look'd upon and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
as a New Notion, I will make good thus;
<hi>the Day of Iudgment</hi> is represented and described
three or four times in these Visions and Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as first at the opening of the Sixth Seal, <hi>ch.</hi> 6.
<hi>v.</hi> 12, to the end: where the Description of the
Last Day agrees exactly with others in the New
Testament, especially that of our Saviour in
<hi>Mat.</hi> 24. and therefore to allegorize it, where
there is no Occasion for it, is unreasonable. If it
be said, that <hi>the Disorder of the Sun, Moon and Stars</hi>
(which is here spoken of) signifies sometimes tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Judgments, as the Destruction of <hi>Babylon,
Isa.</hi> 13. 10. and of <hi>Egypt,</hi> Ezek. 32. 7. I answer,
that though it doth so, yet these Remarkable
Judgments and Devastations were Figures and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
of the Last and Terrible one, and
were so design'd by Heaven, and therefore this
may well be set forth to us by the Holy Ghost in
this manner: nay, <hi>the darkning of the Sun and
Moon,</hi> and the like Expressions, are but <hi>Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
in those former Instances, but here are Proper,
Natural and Real, and therefore ought so to be
understood in this Place. Again, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath
<hi>another</hi> Revelation of this <hi>Great Day,</hi> in the End of
the <hi>11th</hi> Chapter, from <hi>ver.</hi> 15, to the Close of the
Chapter: but especially those plain Words in <hi>ver.
18. Thy Wrath is come, and the time of the Dead that
they should be judged,</hi> place it beyond all doubt that
the <hi>Final Iudgment</hi> of the last Day is here meant.
Again, the Seventh Vial mention'd, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 17.
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:46315:687"/>
which contains the Last Plague, is no other than
the Indignation and Punishment of That Day, as
appears from the Prodigies which accompany it,
and particularly from what is said, <hi>ver. 20. Every
Island fled away, and the Mountains were not found,</hi>
which expresses the terrible Dissolution of the
World at that time. Besides that it is observable
in the Conclusion of the preceding <hi>Vial,</hi> which
made way for this last, that Christ saith, <hi>I come as
a Thief,</hi> v. 15. which manner of Expression is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
applied and made use of when the <hi>Day of
Iudgment</hi> is spoken of, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 43. 1 Thess. 5. 2, 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. And lastly, in the <hi>20th</hi> Chapter,
from the <hi>11th</hi> Verse to the end, there is <hi>another</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of this Last and General Appearance of the
World, as is universally acknowledg'd by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
and therefore we need not stand to clear
it. Now from all this it is evident, that there is
not observed in the Visions of this Book an <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Order or Course of Time;</hi> for if there were, the
General Day of Doom, which is the last thing of
all, could not be represented here three or four
times: This must have come in the shutting up of
all, when all other things were past, whereas now
we see it is represented in the Beginning, in the
Middle, and in the End of these <hi>Revelations:</hi>
Which, if it be well attended to, is one admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Key to open the Secrets of this Book, for hence
we understand that this Prophecy is not (what it
hath been thought to be) one Entire Historical
Narration of what shall be, and that first one thing
is foretold, and then what follows that in time is
next set down, and so on in order. No; the Day
of Judgement being thrice at least inserted, shews,
that the Visions of this Book end, and then begin
again, and then have a Period, and commence
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:46315:687"/>
again, and after that the same or the like Scene is
opened, and things of the same Nature are repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Which is a most evident Argument that this
Book consists of Three or Four Grand Prophecies
or Prophetick Representations of the Condition of
Christ's Church from the time when this was

more than so, to assure us of the Certain Truth
and Reality of these Events, to confirm us in this

                     <p>Thus I have attempted to evince the <hi>Perfection of
Scripture</hi> by enumerating <hi>all the Books of both</hi> TESTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS,
and giving you a brief Account of them
These Excellent and Incomparable Books are the
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:46315:688"/>
                        <hi>True Pandects</hi> indeed, the Books that <hi>comprehend
all,</hi> that treat of every thing that is necessary.
They are the most Valuable Collection of Writings
under Heaven, they are of all the Books in the
World the most worthy of all Acceptation, because
they are our Infallible Rule and Surest Guide to
Wisdom, Holiness and Blessedness, to the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the most Desirable Things here, and
of the most Eligible hereafter. If this and all that
I have said before do not prove them to be <hi>Compleats</hi>
and <hi>Perfect,</hi> I despair of ever telling you what
<hi>will.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>None of the Books of the Holy Scripture are lost: Not
the Book of the Covenant: Nor the Book of the
Wars of the Lord: Nor the Book of Iasher:
Nor the Acts of Vzziah. An Account of the Book

                     </argument>
                     <p>But tho this be a clear and demonstated Truth,
yet it is question'd and doubted of by some.
Wherefore the <hi>Fourth General Undertaking</hi>
which I propounded was this, to clear the Point of
those <hi>Objections,</hi> which are wont to be brought
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:46315:689"/>
against it, and to shew that notwithstanding these
the <hi>Prefection of Scripture is unshaken.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, Some tell us that there is a considerable
Number of Books mention'd or quoted in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as the <hi>Books of the Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Book of the
Wars of the Lord,</hi> the <hi>Book of Iasher,</hi> &amp;c. which
seem to have been once a Part of this Holy Volume,
but now are lost. Among the Fathers<note n="1" place="bottom">Hom. 9. in Matth. &amp; Hom. 7. in 1 Ep. ad Corinth.</note> St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi>
(who is followed by <hi>Theophilact</hi>) is of this
Opinion. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and several of the Papists
hold it. Yea, some Protestants acknowledg as
much: <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Musculus,</hi> and our <hi>Whitaker</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
this way. And <hi>Drusius</hi> is very angry with
any Man that denies that there any Books of Holy
Scripture missing. Now, if this be true, there
is ground to complain of a <hi>Defect</hi> and <hi>Imperfection</hi>
in the Sacred Writings, by reason of the loss of
these Books. That therefore which I am to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
here, is to shew that there are no Books men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in Scripture, as belonging to it, but what
are now to be found in it, and are really a Part of
it, and consequently that the Holy Writings are
not Defective, that the Body of Sacred Scripture
is not Maimed and Imperfect.</p>
                     <p>First, As to the <hi>Book of the Covenant</hi> mention'd
in <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 7. which some fancy is lost, it is not
any distinct Book from the <hi>Body of the Iewish Laws.</hi>
If we impartially weigh the Place, we shall find
that it is no other than a Collection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Volume of
those several Injunctions and Institutions which we
read in the foregoing Chapters (<hi>viz.</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23.)
which God delivered to <hi>Moses</hi> on the Mount. It
is the very same with the <hi>Book of the Law, De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

31. 9. That which hath caused a different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:46315:689"/>
in some is this, that these Laws are call'd
a <hi>Book:</hi> but I shall make it evident afterwards that
this Appellation is of a great latitude, and is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to any sort of <hi>Writing</hi> by the Hebrews.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As for <hi>the Book of the Wars of the Lord,
Numb.</hi> 21. 14. which is thought to be now wanting,
the Answer given by some is, that this was an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypbal</hi>
Author, and so cannot be said to belong to
the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and consequently the loss of
this Book doth not argue the <hi>Imperfection</hi> of the
Bible. But tho this way of Solution be tolerable,
when made use of as to some Other Books hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
mentioned, yet I think there is no need at all
of using it here, because it is not unlikely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Judgment of our<note n="1" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Dr. Lightfoot</hi>'s Chronicle of the Tines of the Old Test.</note> Learned <hi>English Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>i,</hi>
that <hi>Moses</hi> refers here to <hi>himself,</hi> and a <hi>Book</hi> of
his own composing; for we read that upon the
Discomfiture of <hi>Amalek</hi> God commanded <hi>Moses
to write it for a Memorial in a Book,</hi> Exod. 17. 14.
and (as it follows) <hi>to rehearse it in the Ears of</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua.
So that it may seem to have been some
Book of Directions written by <hi>Moses</hi> for <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s
managing of the Wars after him. Thus this
Learned Writer makes this <hi>Book</hi> only to be of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
use, and dictated by an Ordinary, not a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Spirit: wherefore it cannot be one of the
Books of the Bible. And if this be true, then
though it be lost, yet no Canonical Scripture is
lost hereby. But from what I shall propound, I
think it will be found reasonable to believe that the
<hi>Book</hi> in this Place mention'd is one of the received
Books of the Old Testament, <hi>i. e.</hi> it is the <hi>Book of
Iudges,</hi> which deservedly hath the Name of the
<hi>Book of the Wars of the Lord,</hi> because it recounts
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:46315:690"/>
those Warlike Enterprizes which those Hero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ck
Spirits stirr'd up by God in an extraordinary Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
were famous for. Or <hi>Milchamoth Iehovah,
the Wars of the Lord,</hi> are as much as the <hi>Great,
Wonderful</hi> and <hi>Renowned Wars</hi> (for perhaps the
Name of <hi>God</hi> is used here, as in several other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
to augment the Sense, and to express the
Greatness and Excellency of the Thing) fought by
the Valiant <hi>Iews.</hi> To any one that consults the
Text together with the <hi>26th v.</hi> of that Chapter,
it will plainly appear that this Passage particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refers to the <hi>11th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Iudges, v.</hi> 15
16, 17. But if you ask how <hi>Moses,</hi> who was dead
long before, could write this? I answer, though
he undoubtedly writ the Book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> as well
as the rest of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> yet some few Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in this and the other Books may reasonably
be supposed to be inserted afterwards by some other
Inspired Persons, as I have had Occasion to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
before. <hi>Ezra,</hi> it is likely, revising this Book,
added this of <hi>what God did in the Red Sea, and at the
Brooks of</hi> Arnon. And to give yet more ample Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to this Scruple, I desire it may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that though we translate the Text thus, <hi>It is
said in the Book of the Wars,</hi> &amp;c. yet in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
the Verb is in the future Tense, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it shall be said:</hi> and so we may look upon it as
a Prophecy of <hi>Moses.</hi> He here foretels that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it shall be commemorated how God fought
for his People. When there shall be at solemn
Times a Rehearsal of the Jewish Wars, then this
Passage shall be call'd to mind and made mention of.
And then we must look upon these two Verses,
not as cited out of the <hi>Book of Iudges,</hi> but proposed
to be inserted there afterwards. The plain An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
then is, that the <hi>Book of the Wars of the Lord</hi>
                        <pb n="455" facs="tcp:46315:690"/>
is <hi>the Book of Iudges,</hi> together with that of <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
where are related the Particulars of the <hi>Holy War,
i. e.</hi> the War of the Jews against the Infidels, and
that in one of these it shall be particularly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
and recorded <hi>what God did in the Red Sea,
and in the Brooks of</hi> Arnon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and accordingly
we find it inserted in the forecited Place in <hi>Iudges.</hi>
Thus you see it can't be proved hence that the
Church hath lost any Part of the Book of God.</p>
                     <p>Another Book said by some to be lost is the
Book of <hi>Iasher,</hi> mention'd in <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10. 13. &amp; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
1. 18. But some of the most celebrated Hebrew
Doctors say they have found it, telling us that it
is the <hi>Book of Genesis,</hi> wherein are contain'd the
Acts of <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> and other <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi>
who were by way of Excellence call'd <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sherim,
Recti, Iusti.</hi> But surely that Man is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfied who can acquiesce in this. Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot</hi>
holds <hi>the Book of Iasher</hi> to be the same with
that which I asserted <hi>the Book of the Wars of God</hi>
to be: But there is little Foundation for it, for
though the particular Narrative of <hi>the Sun's stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
still,</hi> be in the Book of <hi>Iasher,</hi> (as we learn from
the Text) yet there is no intimation that all <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>'s
<hi>Wars,</hi> or the <hi>Wars of the Israelites</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred
there. This <hi>Book</hi> was according to the

that <hi>Iasher</hi>'s <hi>Book</hi> is as much as a <hi>True Book,</hi>
a Book that is not counterfeited. It was not the
Work of any Inspired Person, but was of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Common Civil <hi>Annals:</hi> and consequently
we cannot infer hence that any Book properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> i. e. that was written
by Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, is at this Day
missing.</p>
                     <p>Again, some reckon <hi>the Acts of</hi> Uzziah <hi>written
by</hi> Isaiah <hi>the Prophet,</hi> 2 Chron. 26. 22. in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ogue
of such Books of Scripture as are lost. But
they have little reason to do so, for by tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>
Words is plainly meant that Part of the Life and
History of that King which we now have in the
<hi>Prophecy of Isaiah,</hi> for the first six Chapters are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
Relation of what was done in his Days. They
give an Account of several Passages which belong
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:46315:691"/>
to the Church and State in that King's Reign.
And <hi>Isaiah</hi> is truly said in the foremention'd Place
in the <hi>Chronicles</hi> to have <hi>written his Acts first and
last,</hi> because you will find that the Prophecy of
<hi>Isaiah</hi> begins at the <hi>Days of</hi> Uzziah, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and the
sixth Chapter relates what happen'd <hi>in the Year that
King</hi> Uzziah <hi>died,</hi> v. 1. So that something of
what was <hi>first and last</hi> in his Time is here recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
This I look upon as a very substantial and
satisfactory Answer to the Scruple about that
Place.</p>
                     <p>Also, some would infer from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 29.
that all the Canonical Books of the Bible are not
extant at this Day, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cause there is mention of
<hi>the Book of</hi> Samuel <hi>the Seer,</hi> and <hi>the Book of</hi> Nathan
<hi>the Prophet,</hi> and <hi>the Book of</hi> Gad <hi>the Seer,</hi> in which
it is said, <hi>all</hi> David'<hi>s Acts were written.</hi> But no such
Inference can rationally be made: only this we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(which is the Solution of the Difficulty) that
<hi>Nathan</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> as well as <hi>Samuel</hi> compiled the
History that goes under the Name of this last:
and because it was made by them all three, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is represented here as three different Books.
But the true Account is that those two Books in
the Old Testament which bear the Name of <hi>Samuel,</hi>
were written partly by him (the greatest Part of
the first Book relating things that happen'd in his
time) and partly by <hi>Nathan,</hi> and partly by <hi>Gad,</hi>
two eminent Prophets in those Days, and who sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
<hi>Samuel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then as to 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. 29. where we are told
that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Acts were written</hi> not only <hi>in the Book</hi>
(<hi>Hebr. Dibrim, the Words,</hi> as the Book of <hi>Chronicles</hi>
is call'd <hi>the Words of Days) of</hi> Nathan, (of which
before) but in the Prophecy of <hi>Ahijah the Shilonite,
and in the Visions of</hi> Iddo <hi>the Seer,</hi> which last are
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:46315:692"/>
call'd <hi>Midrash, the Story</hi> or <hi>Commentary of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
Iddo, <hi>Chap. 13. v.</hi> 22. And as to 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.
15. where we read also of this <hi>Book of</hi> Iddo <hi>the
Seer,</hi> and of <hi>Shemaiah the Prophet,</hi> in which it is said,
<hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s <hi>Acts were written,</hi> the Answer which I
give relating to these Books in brief is this, that
few of them, if any, are different from those of
<hi>the Kings,</hi> but are only a Part of them, though
they are here spoken of as <hi>Distinct Books,</hi> and that
for this reason, because that individual Part of the
Story, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> is
quoted, which these particular Persons here nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
wrote. You must know then that this Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Part of the Old Testament was the Work of
several Persons, it was a Collection made by sundry
Prophets and Holy Men, as <hi>Samuel, Nathan, Gad,
Ahijah, Iddo, Shemaiah;</hi> and the Books which they
wrote are called <hi>the Books of Samuel,</hi> and <hi>the Books of
the Kings,</hi> and are generally known by these Names;
but when those <hi>Parts</hi> of them which were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
inserted and written by <hi>Samuel himself,</hi> or
<hi>Nathan,</hi> &amp;c. are quoted or referr'd to in the <hi>Books
of the Chronicles,</hi> they are mentioned as <hi>Distinct
Books:</hi> the meaning of which is, that they are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Parts of such a History, and wrote by such
Particular Persons, who altogether made up that
Historical Part of the Bible. Those <hi>Books</hi> then
(for so the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call any <hi>Writings</hi>) which those
Authors above-named wrote are not lost, as some
imagine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        </gap> of the <hi>Books of Samuel</hi> and <hi>the Kings.</hi>
This Answer is grounded on 1 <hi>Chron. 29. 29. The
Acts of</hi> David <hi>the King first and last, behold, they are
written in the Book (or History) of</hi> Samuel, <hi>and in
the Book of</hi> Nathan <hi>the Prophet,</hi> &amp;c. which shews
that the foresaid Books were a Collection made by
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:46315:692"/>
several Prophets, <hi>viz. Samuel, Nathan, Gad,</hi> &amp;c.
This I think is very plain, and the foresaid Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is wholly removed by it.</p>
                     <p>Then, as to the rest of those Books which are
said to be lost, as the <hi>Sayings of the Seers,</hi> 2 Chron.
33. 19. and <hi>the Book of the Acts of</hi> Solomon, 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
11. 41. and <hi>the Book of</hi> Jehu <hi>the Son of</hi> Hanani,
2 Chron. 20. 34. or any other which the <hi>Objectors</hi>
mention, it is granted by some very Sober Writers
(not only Foreigners but of our own Country)
that these Books are really lost, but they deny that
this is any Argument of the <hi>Imperfection of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
because these Books were not absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
neither are we certain that they were Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
endited. And this was the Opinion of the
<hi>Antients</hi> as well as the <hi>Moderns.</hi> Yea St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>
and some others of the <hi>Fathers</hi> who speak of these
Books, say positively that they were not written by
Inspiration from Heaven. To this Purpose St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
hath this useful Distinction,<note n="1" place="bottom">Ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Sacred Scripture (saith he) write some things
as they are Men with Historical Care and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
other things they write as Prophets by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
from God. This then may satisfy us that
all that was written by the Prophets, and even by
those Holy Men who were Authors of some Part
of the Bible, was not <hi>Canonical</hi> and <hi>Divine;</hi> because
they writ some things not as Inspired Persons, but
as meer Historians. Some of <hi>this</hi> sort of Writings
are referr'd to in the forecited Places; and though
they be not extant now, yet the <hi>Scripture</hi> is not
hereby rendered <hi>Imperfect,</hi> because these were not
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:46315:693"/>
such Parts of it as were Essential to it, or were of
Divine Inspiration. The like may be said when in
<hi>the Book of Kings</hi> there is frequent reference to <hi>the
Book of Chronicles;</hi> those of the <hi>Bible</hi> are not <hi>always</hi>
meant, being not then penned: Besides that many
things that are referr'd unto there are not found
in these Books. Wherefore it is probable that
these were <hi>Additional Writings,</hi> not belonging to
the Body of the Canonical Scripture, nor writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Persons that were Inspired, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
though they are lost, yet the Canon of the Bible
is not impaired. And indeed we find that those of
the <hi>Protestant</hi> Perswasion (as <hi>Whitaker, Willet,</hi> &amp;c.
and among Foreigners, <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> &amp;c.) who
acknowledg the loss of these Books, do at the same
time strongly assert the <hi>Perfection of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi>
which they very consistently may do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they hold these Books to be no part of the
<hi>Canon</hi> of the Bible.</p>
                     <p>Again, if what we have said be not fully satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
this may be further added, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
of the Loss of some Books of Holy Writ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from the mistaking of the Word <hi>Sepher,</hi>
which is translated a <hi>Book,</hi> but among the <hi>Hebrews</hi>
is oftentimes no more than a <hi>Rehearsal</hi> or <hi>Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration</hi>
of something, a brief <hi>Narrative</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moir,</hi>
a setting down any thing in Writing, as

Gospel, <hi>The Book of the Generation of Iesus Christ,
Mat. 1. 1. <hi>i. e. his</hi> Genealogy</hi> or <hi>Pedigree,</hi> a brief

which is the proper Denotation of the Word <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi>

or <hi>Ciphra,</hi> a Word that is used in most Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.
Some not attending to this have fancied
that a great many Books of the Sacred Writ are
embezzled, because they do not find such Formal
Books as those of <hi>Iehu,</hi> or of <hi>the Acts of</hi> Solomon,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> now belonging to the Bible. This arises from
a misunderstanding of the <hi>Hebrew Word,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
generally any Short kind of <hi>Writing</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum.</hi>
This, with the Answer before given,
will solve all Doubts concerning the Places afore
alledged.</p>
                     <p>As to the common Objection concerning the
Loss of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Books,</hi> which are said to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 32, 33. I answer; 1. That
when some call them <hi>Books,</hi> it is more than they
can prove: it is not said that <hi>Solomon wrote,</hi> but
that <hi>he Spake of Trees,</hi> and <hi>spake of Beasts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi>
he learnedly discoursed of these several Subjects
upon occasion, and <hi>Spake</hi> such a Number of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs.</hi>
Here can be <hi>no Loss of Books</hi> then. But,
2. Suppose he committed these Disquisitions and
Discourses to Writing, and they are now lost,
(it may be consumed when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> burnt
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or by some other Means imbezzled af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards)
yet still this is nothing to the purpose,
because they were no Part of <hi>Canonical Scripture.</hi>
His Universal <hi>History of Vegetables,</hi> from the Cedar
even to the Hysop that grows out of the Wall, and
his Books of the Nature of all <hi>Animals</hi> in the Sea,
on the Land, and in the Air, appertained to <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy,</hi>
and might indeed have serv'd to have set up
a <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and have been advantageous to the
Men who are employ'd in the Study of Nature; for
these questionless were full of Admirable Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
according to that great and matchless Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:46315:694"/>
of Wisdom which God had endued him with.
Thus far the Loss of those Writings is great, but
none but Philosophers ought to bewail it. Tho
I must suggest this by the way, that perhaps there
is no ground of complaining for them neither; for
it may be these Books of <hi>Plants</hi> and <hi>Animals</hi> were
extant till <hi>Alexander the Great</hi>'s Days, and being
perused and understood by <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus,</hi>
by the Help of an Interpreter, they were
transcribed by them, and so set down as we find
them in their Writings which have gain'd them so
great Fame and Renown. This may be the more
credible, especially as to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> because we read
that he was a Great Plagiary, and burnt or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
made away those Writings from whence he
borrowed his Notions. If this be true, it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we have these <hi>Books of Solomon</hi> extant still: in
those forenamed Authors we read his <hi>Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi>
concerning <hi>Vegetables</hi> and <hi>Animals.</hi> But as
touching the <hi>three thousand Proverbs which he spake,</hi>
it is most reasonable to believe that most of them
were <hi>only spoken,</hi> not written down: and as for
those that were penn'd, we have them at this Day
in <hi>the Book of Proverbs,</hi> which is Part of the Canon
of Scripture. There we have <hi>those Proverbs</hi> which
the Holy Ghost saw to be most profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for the Church: That one would think
should content us. So as to his <hi>Songs, which were a
thousand and five,</hi> (as we read in the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Place) there is but One of them that hath
arrived at our Hands, and was thought worthy to
be inserted into the Sacred Writings, unless we
reckon the <hi>Forty fifth Psalm</hi> to be a <hi>Song</hi> of his.
This then adds to the Excellency of these Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>Solomon</hi> which we have, that they are
Choice Pieces, selected even by the Holy Ghost,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:46315:694"/>
who was the Prime Author of them. This surely
may satisfy us that the Books or Writings of this
Wise Prince, which were most Excellent, and
which were dictated by the Spirit, are transmitted
to us, and are Part of the Bible. Thus there is
nothing lost that belongs to the Canonical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Old Testament.</p>
                     <p>And whereas it is <hi>Objected</hi> that some Places are
quoted in the <hi>New Testament</hi> as taken out of the
<hi>Old,</hi> and yet are not to be found there, as <hi>Mat. 2.
23. Iames 4. 5. Iude, v.</hi> 14. I answer as to the first,
that from those Words, <hi>That it might be fulfilled
which was spoken by the Prophets, He shall be called a
Nazarene,</hi> no Man can gather that some of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
Books of Scripture are missing; because if
you take the <hi>Prophets</hi> here for Prophetick Men who
<hi>spoke</hi> only, and did not <hi>write,</hi> then there were no
<hi>Books</hi> of theirs to be lost. Or if by <hi>Prophets</hi> you
understand the Penmen of the Bible, it may be
shew'd that what they foretold is still extant in
their Writings. For though those individual
Words, <hi>He shall be call'd a Nazarene,</hi> are not found
among the Prophecies of the Old Testament, yet
the Purport and Sense of them are there, and the
Places to which they have reference are very obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as I have shewed in that particular Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Words which I have offered to the
Publick in my <hi>Enquiry into some Remarkable Texts of
the New Testament.</hi> Thence I hope it will appear
that the <hi>Objectors</hi> have no ground for what they
alledg, and also that the <hi>Iews</hi> Cavil against this
Place of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where they say he quotes a
Text out of the Prophets which is not to be found
in any of them, is void of all Reason.</p>
                     <p>Another Place which is wont to be mention'd on
this Occasion is <hi>Iam. 4. 5. Do you think that the

forced and strained, and an impartial Eye cannot
possibly see any Affinity between the two Places of
Scripture; besides that there is one Interrogation
to introduce another, which confounds the Stile.
The plain and unforced Answer is this, that St.

Scripture, as if there were such <hi>express</hi> Words in
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:46315:695"/>

that it is enclined to Envy as well as to

he means this very First Epistle he was now
writing. He refers to what he had said b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fore in

is, When I even now wrote unto you in this
Epistle, <hi>ver. 2. not to keep Company with Fornicators,</hi>
I do not mean the Fornicators of this World.
Thus St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and <hi>Theophylact</hi> interpret the
Place. But, if I may be permitted to vary from
those Excellent Fathers, I would propound one of
these two ways of understanding the Apostle's
Words. First, it may be he hath reference here
to what he saith <hi>afterwards</hi> in this Epistle, <hi>ch. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
v.</hi> 13. and again, <hi>v.</hi> 18. &amp; <hi>ch. 7. v.</hi> 2. where he
writes to them <hi>to avoid Fornication.</hi> Wherefore
upon reading over this Epistle, after he had finish'd
it, he thought good to insert this, and to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
here of what he saith afterwards; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>I have</hi> (saith he) <hi>written to y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>
in this Epistle, viz.</hi> in some of the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
against Fornication, and joining your selves to
Persons that are noted for that Vice. Or else I
conceive the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is put for <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> (the
Preterit for the present Tense, of which there are
very near an hundred Instances in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and all Men vers'd in Criticism know that
there is nothing more common). Thus <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is
used in this very Epistle, <hi>ch. 9. v.</hi> 15. [Neither
have I written these things] <hi>i. e.</hi> at this time, in
this Epistle that I am now writing. This any
Man, that consults the Context, will be forc'd to
acknowledg to be the true Sense of the Place:
whence it appears that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is equivalent with

                        </gap>. So you will find the Word must be taken
in the <hi>1st</hi> Epistle of St. <hi>Iohn, 2d</hi> Chapter: you
will see and be throughly convinced that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. is expressed by <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>
is no other than <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c.
<hi>I write unto you in this Epistle not to,</hi> &amp;c. Which that
it ought to be rendred so is evident from <hi>ver.</hi> 11.
(which is but a Repetition or Reassumption of this)
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>now I write unto you:</hi> the Adverb

                        </gap> shews that it is spoken of the <hi>Present Instant
Time,</hi> though the Greek Verb be in the <hi>Praeterit.</hi>
This then I offer as the plain Sense of the Text and
Context, <hi>I write unto you, O Corinthians, in this my
Letter, not to be mingled</hi> (so the Word properly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes)
<hi>with Fornicators, or with the Covetous, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners,
or Idolaters, for then you must needs go out
of the World</hi> (there being so great a Multitude of
them): <hi>but this is that which I mean, that you should
avoid the Company of a Brother (i. e.</hi> a Professed
Christian) <hi>if he be given to Fornication, Covetousness,
Extortion, or Idolatry. This is the Thing which I at
this time write and signify to you.</hi> So that you see
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is instead of <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>: the simple and plain
Tenour of the Words may convince any Man of
it. And therefore the true and genuine Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
both of the former and latter <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is <hi>I
write:</hi> which makes the Apostle's Sense clear and
perspicuous. I appeal to any Man of Judgment
and Sagacity, whether this Account of the Words
be not exactly adjusted to Grammar and Criticism,
to the Scope of the Apostle, and the Design of the
Context: besides that it is serviceable to the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> utterly to overthrow the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of an Epistle written to the Corinthians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this which the Apostle is here writing. If
the Learned <hi>Drusius,</hi> or the Excellent <hi>Grotius</hi> had
weighed these things which I have suggested, I
doubt not but they would have chang'd their Minds,
they would not have cried out that this Epistle here
spoken of is lost.</p>

                        </gap>mport of the <hi>Latin</hi> is not what he represents it to

by the apostle.</hi> At least there is no necessity of
making this Construction, for it may as well signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:46315:698"/>
                        <hi>an Epistle written from</hi> Laodicea <hi>by the Apostle.</hi> If
it be demanded, what Epistle this was? and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>quently,
what Epistle is here meant? The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is, that it is probable it is the <hi>first Epistle to
Timothy,</hi> that being written <hi>from Laodi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ea,</hi> as you
will find in the Close of it. Or, 3. if he speaks
of an Epistle brought to the <hi>Colossians</hi> from <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea,</hi>
it being wrote to the Christians of that Place
by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it may be the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
because <hi>Laodicea</hi> was a Church within the Circuit
of the <hi>Ephesian Church,</hi> which was the <hi>Metropolitan</hi>
of all <hi>Asia.</hi> And <hi>Ephesus</hi> being the chief City of
this <hi>Proconsular Asia,</hi> this Epistle may refer to all
the Province. As to the Ground and Occasion of
producing an <hi>Epistle to the Laodiceans,</hi> perhaps it
was this, St. <hi>Paul</hi> order'd that <hi>his Epistle to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians
should be read in the Church of the Laodiceans,</hi>
which was near to <hi>Colosse,</hi> Col. 4. 16. And we
must remember this, that though <hi>Colosse</hi> was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
City, yet <hi>Laodicea</hi> was more considerable
in that <hi>Province.</hi> But it is likely there were more
Christians in the former than in the latter; and
that moved the Apostle to direct his Epistle to the
<hi>Colossians;</hi> but withal he enjoins it to be read in
the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the chief City. Now, it
being read there, it was said to be an <hi>Epistle to the
Laodiceans,</hi> whence in time some feigned this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
which is now extant. This I conceive may be
the Cause of the Mistake and Forgery. Lastly, if
after all we should suppose (though I see no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for it) that the Epistle which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here
speaks of is lost, yet if the Substance of it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Other Epistles, or in the rest of the
Books of the New Testament which we have, the
Scripture is not maimed: and therefore the <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi>
have no Reason to cavil against it as Imperfect
and Defective.</p>

But an <hi>Objection</hi> of another Nature is shaped o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Lord:</hi> And <hi>v. 25. I have no Commandment of the

v. 17. I speak not after the Lord.</hi> From all which
Texts they gather that there is something in
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles that is not divinely dictated. He
acknowledgeth as much himself, say they, and we
ought to give credit to him. And if it be thus,
wherein doth this Part of Scripture excel any other
Writings? I will return a distinct Answer to the
several Quotations. The first speaks of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
rendering that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (<hi>v.</hi> 3.) requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Conjugal State: and the Apostle shews
the Extent of the Obligation of this Advice which
he gives about it. <hi>I speak this,</hi> saith he, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>in way of Permission,</hi> that is, I herein permit
you to do as you shall see Occasion, as you shall find
your selves disposed. If you can refrain in those
Circumstances I mention, then do so: but if not,
I allow you to act otherwise. I speak to you <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<hi>not of Commandment,</hi> i. e. in a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
way. I am not positive, I do not command
you. I have no Absolute Injunction to lay upon you
in this Matter. If you can forbear, you had best
to do so, but I have no Authority to force it upon
you. Thus the Apostle lets them see how far his
Doctrine obliges, and what Authority it hath.
And this he speaks as an Inspired Person: So
that it is ridiculous to collect hence that he was
not Inspired when he wrote this Passage in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle.</p>
                     <p>The Second Place speaks of Divorce or the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of married Persons in case of unequal
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:46315:699"/>
Marriages, <hi>viz.</hi> between Christians and Infidels.
These are the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> the <hi>Rest,</hi> which he now distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applies his Discourse to. <hi>To these,</hi> saith he,
<hi>speak I,</hi> i. e. <hi>I</hi> as an Apostle, <hi>I</hi> as a Person divinely
enlightn'd declare this, that their best course is to
live together, and not to think of parting. This is
that which I say to those who are married to Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
and I say it by immediate Revelation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rom
God. That is the true Meaning of <hi>Speak I:</hi> And
any considerate Man that well weighs the Words
cannot but discern it. It follows, <hi>and not the Lord,
i. e.</hi> God hath given us no express Command about
this: We find nothing of it in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law which
was from the Lord himself. The Apostle refers
here to what he had said before in this Chapter
about <hi>Married Persons, v.</hi> 2, 3. which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 10. and a Law
before that, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Genesis,</hi> ch. 2. v. 24. which
obligeth the Married Couple to be faithful to one
another. But here, saith he, in our present Case
<hi>the Lord</hi> hath left no positive and Absolute Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
or Prohibition. Or, it may have respect also
to <hi>Christ our Lord,</hi> and then the meaning of <hi>I speak,
and not the Lord</hi> is this, what I now deliver to you is
not from our B. Saviour directly: It is not expresly
set down in the Gospel as spoken by Him when he
was here on Earth, but I gather it from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Doctrine of the Gospel, and I make this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
and Inference by the Guidance of the Holy
Spirit, and not of my own Head. Thus what I
advise and direct you to is <hi>from the Lord,</hi> i. e. from
the Holy Ghost, though <hi>not from the Lord</hi> in that
other Sense, as if he had given any particular and
express Command concerning it. So the Force of
the Objection is quite taken of: And at the same
time also, the Distinction of <hi>Evangelical Counsels</hi>
                        <pb n="474" facs="tcp:46315:700"/>

concerning these hath. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>,
<hi>I have not a Commandment of the Lord,</hi> i. e. I
have no express Word of our Saviour concerning
<hi>Virgins,</hi> as there was concerning the Divorce of
<hi>Married Persons,</hi> of whom I spake <hi>v.</hi> 10. for our

                        </gap>
Precept of our Lord can be alledg'd; he hath no
where peremptorily commanded to marry, or
not to marry: And the more particular things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to a <hi>Single Life</hi> (spoken of here by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
are not so much as mention'd by him. <hi>Yet,</hi>
saith he, <hi>I give my Iudgment, as one that hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
Mercy of the Lord to be faithful,</hi> i. e. in an
immediate and extraordinary Manner I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this Favour, to deliver faithfully what is
dictated to me in this Affair, though there be no
express Word of our Lord about it. I am Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taught what to say, the Holy Spirit suggests
to me what Counsel to give. And therefore with
respect to this and whatever he said before, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
in the last Verse of this Chapter, that <hi>he
hath the Spirit of God.</hi> And when he saith he <hi>thinks</hi>
so, it doth not denote in the least, the Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the thing, but the Humility of the Apostle.
We are not then to imagine (as several Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,

                        </gap>matter
he treats of, and the particular Application
of this Expression. For in this Chapter his Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and he requests that they would
be very Liberal, and <hi>abound</hi> in this Excellent and
Noble Work: which yet he saith he doth not speak

                        </gap>e leaves them to their Liberty. He would have
their Charity to be free, and therefore doth not
command them. It is of the same Strain with

to enjoin that which is convenient, yet for Love's Sake I

Which ought necessarily to be added, to clear this
and the other Texts: for I do not find that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators
have fully interpreted and explain'd
these Places. Only they tell us that the Apostle
doth not command the things to be done, but leaves
them at Liberty: whereby they intimate that
what he saith is from himself, it is his Private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
But we must not harbour any such Thoughts,
because if all <hi>Scripture</hi> be endited by the Holy
Ghost, (as certainly it is) then we san't admit
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:46315:701"/>
of any such thing here as meer Private Opinion.</p>
                     <p>The last Place alledged is, <hi>I speak not after the

                        </gap>nse of the Apostle in those Places
I have spoken of, but they hugely mistake the Text,
and miserably distort the Apostle's Meaning.
Therefore my Apprehension of the Words is this,

saith he, whom some of you have such a
Kindness for, exceedingly boast of their great
Performances among you. I think I had best to
do so too, for that it is the way to gain your
good Opinion of me. I can brag and glory of
my Atchievements as much as any of them, yea
much more. Therefore <hi>as a Fool receive me, that
I may boast my self a little. Seeing that many glory
after the Flesh, I will glory also. For ye suffer Fools
gladly, seeing ye your selves are Wise.</hi> You and
your new Teachers are Masters of great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
without doubt, and it cannot but be a very
laudable Thing to imitate you, especially in
your Boasting and Vaunting. And yet when
I am forced to commend my self and vindicate
my Actions, <hi>that which I speak thus, I speak it not
after the Lord,</hi> no, by no means: I can neither
say nor do any thing that is wise or good: I
am (in the Esteem of some of you) a <hi>Fool</hi> and a

seems to be the clear Import of the Words, and it
is not the only time that St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath addressed

their Version. Some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as excessively inveigh against it. The true Grounds
of the Difference between the Hebrew Text and
the Greek Translation of the Septuagint assigned,
viz. One Hebrew Vowel is put for another: One Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant
for another, sometimes both Vowels and
Consonants are mistaken: The Difference of the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of some Hebrew Words is another Cause:
Sometimes the Sense rather than the Word it self is
attended to: Some Faults are to be attributed to the
Transcribers: Some, because the LXX are Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasts
rather than Translators; they take the Liberty
to insert Words and Passages of their own. The Greek
Version hath been designedly corrupted in several Places.
Why the Apostles in their Sermons and Writings made
use of this Version, though it was faulty. Sometimes
the Sacred Writers keep close to the Hebrew Text,
and take no notice of the Seventy's Translation of
the Words. At other times in their Quotations they
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Greek Version is to be read with Candour and
Caution: And must always give way to the Hebrew
Original. The chief Latin Translations of the Bible,

because they observe a great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi> of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the several <hi>Versions</hi> of it: And so as to
the New Testament, they see the <hi>Original Greek</hi> and

the Disagreement is seen bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and the <hi>Greek Translation</hi> of
it made by the <hi>Seventy Elders.</hi> This is improved
into a kind of Argument thus; If those Versions of
the Bible disagree with the Text, then either the
Text it self or the Versions are erroneous and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the former, <hi>i. e.</hi> in plain Terms that we have

and consequently that the Bible it self is very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective

Argument it is necessary that we enquire into, and

Scripture with the Churches of the East) and
though they were made and writ at several times,
yet they do very much agree with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> which
we have at this Day: And whenever in any Place
they vary from it, it is generally in some little
things, wherein there is no prejudice to Truth, or
the Variation is only as to the Paraphrastical Part,
where we cannot expect an exact Rendring of the
Original; and with any considerate and unbiassed

of the Original.</p>

But of all the Translations which are in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental

of this Version was the Change of the Tongue
among the Jews: They in the Time of the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
in <hi>Babylon,</hi> which lasted 70 Years, corrupted
the Hebrew Tongue, that is, they mixed <hi>Hebrew</hi>
(their own Tongue) and <hi>Chaldee</hi> (the Language of
that Place where they were) together. Yea, tho
the Scribes and Learned Men had not forgot the
<hi>Hebrew,</hi> yet the common People had, and being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

wholly to the Speech of that Countrey, they
understood only Chaldee. Wherefore that they
might have the Bible in a Language which they
understood, several <hi>Chaldean Targums</hi> were made
on the Books of the Bible, indeed on all but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
and <hi>Ezra</hi> (which were half <hi>Chaldee</hi> before)
and the <hi>Paralipomend,</hi> which were explain'd in the

by different Authors, and at diverse Times. First,
there was that of <hi>R. Ionathan,</hi> which was a Tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
or Paraphrase rather on the Prophets and the
Historical Books. He is said to be <hi>R. Hillel</hi>'s Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
and to have lived a little before our Saviour's
Nativity. Secondly, there was that of <hi>Onkelos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi>
which was only on the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> This Author
lived soon after Christ's Time: Though I know a
very<note n="1" place="bottom">Mons. <hi>Simon</hi> Crit. <hi>Hist.</hi> l. 2.</note> Confident Writer tells us, that there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to doubt whether <hi>Onkelos</hi> and <hi>Ionathan</hi> were
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:46315:703"/>
the Authors of those two Chaldee Paraphrases,
and he positively avoweth that the <hi>Time</hi> when they
were made cannot be known. Moreover, it is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted
by<note n="1" place="bottom">Is. Vossius.</note> another of as great Confidence and
Learning, that neither the Paraphrases of <hi>Onkelos</hi> nor
<hi>Ionathan</hi> are a thousand Years old, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that that of <hi>Onkelos</hi> is not so much as mentioned
by any Jew or Christian who was not after St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi>
some Ages. The same was said before by as
<note n="2" place="bottom">Morin. Exercitat. Bibl. l. 2. Exercitat. 8.</note> Positive a Man, but was never proved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we have no reason to attend to it, much less
to believe it, especially since we know the Design
of the Man, which was to beat down the Credit
and Value of all Translations of the Bible but the
<hi>Latin</hi> one. It appears from sufficient Authors, that
these two Chaldee Paraphrases are some of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientest
of the Jewish Writings on the Bible, and
it appears from these Targums themselves that they
agree with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text which is extant at this
Day. Thirdly, there was the <hi>Ierusalem Targum,</hi>
call'd so either from the peculiar Dialect of it, or
from its being first published in that place. This
was upon the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> only, and was written (as
is generally thought) by <hi>R. Iochanan</hi> after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> To these 3 Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrases
(which were of Greatest Authority among
the Jews, and were read in their Synagogues) are
wont to be added two others, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Targum of
Ionathan</hi> (the Rabbi before mention'd) on the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch,</hi>
and the <hi>Targum</hi> of <hi>Ioseph the Blind</hi> on the
<hi>Psalms, Iob, Proverbs, Esther, Canticles.</hi> And
there were other Versions of some other Books of
the Bible which were made for the sake of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed
Jews in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and were likewise call'd
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:46315:704"/>
                        <hi>Targumim,</hi> all which are unanimously acknowledg'd
by the Learnedest of the Antients and Moderns to
be faithful Translations of the Original; and none
but prepossessed Minds can find any disagreement
between them as to the Main. It is true these are
<hi>Paraphrasts</hi> rather than <hi>Translators,</hi> and therefore it
can't be expected that these <hi>Targumists</hi> should ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Hebrew Word for Word: It cannot rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
be thought that in this free way of giving the
Sense of the Original they should be exact: They
intended a Comment only in some places, and not
an exact Version.</p>
                     <p>To pass then from the Translations which have
been made in the <hi>Oriental</hi> Tongues to some <hi>Others,</hi>
I will in the next Place speak of the Greek Versi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Bible, and more especially of that of
the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> The Greek Translations of the
Old Testament are either those that were made
since our Saviour's Time, or that Celebrated One
made before it. As for those that were made since
Christ's Time, the Author of the first of them
was <hi>Aquila,</hi> who lived under the Emperor <hi>Adrian,</hi>
and was converted from Gentilism to Christianity,
and then forsook Christianity and turned Jew, and
translated the Old Testament out of Hebrew into
Greek. He was a very Morose Interpreter, even
to Superstition adhering to the Hebrew Letter,
and altogether averse from the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The next Greek Version was that of <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
in the Emperor <hi>Commodus</hi>'s Time, who was
an <hi>Ebionite</hi> or Judaizing Christian. A third was
put out in the Emperor <hi>Severus</hi>'s Reign by <hi>Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
who was first a Jew of the Samaritan Sect,
and afterwards a Christian, but an <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ionite</hi> or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing
Heretick, wherefore he is call'd <hi>Semi-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianus</hi>
by St. <hi>Ierom.</hi> These were the Authors of
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:46315:704"/>
the three first Interpretations of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that were composed after our Saviour's Days,
and you hear what kind of Persons they were.
One of these Translations was wholly Literal, the
other took a Liberty and followed the Sense, and
the third was of a middle Nature: But none of
them were ever publickly received, and read by
the Church. Wherefore there is no reason to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, and to accuse it of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
if we find that these vary from it: Though
to speak impartially, the Translations of these
foresaid Men (notwithstanding that they bear the
Chracter of Apostates and Hereticks) dissent not
from the Hebrew in any thing of considerable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
There are two other Translations mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but we know not the Authors of them. These
five with the LXX's <hi>Version</hi> made up <hi>Origen</hi>'s
<hi>Hexapla.</hi> As for the other Greek Interpretations
of the Old Testament which were publish'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Lucian the Martyr,</hi> and the
other of <hi>Hesychius,</hi> they were not (properly speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
New Versions, but only New and Correct Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> Translation, which was
purged from its Errors and Faults by these Worthy
Undertakers. So much concerning the <hi>Greek Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations</hi>
since Christ.</p>
                     <p>Our main Business is with that which was <hi>before</hi>
our Saviour's Days, that First Translation which
was made of the Bible by the Jews, that most Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Work of the <hi>Seventy Elders</hi> about 250, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
say about 260 Years before Christ's Birth. It
is true, before the LXX set about the Version of the
whole Bible, <hi>some part</hi> of it was translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Greek.</hi> viz. <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Writings</hi> in the time of the
<hi>Persian Monarchy,</hi> if we may believe <hi>Megasthenes,</hi>
                        <pb n="484" facs="tcp:46315:705"/>
who is quoted by<note n="1" place="bottom">Prap. Evang. l. 9. c. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Eusebius.</hi> And<note n="2" place="bottom">Strom. l. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Clement</hi> of
<hi>Alexandria</hi> attests, that some part of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was turn'd into Greek a little before <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Great</hi>'s Time. Which is not improbable if
we consider that from about the time that <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Great</hi> transferr'd the Persian Monarchy to the
Greeks, the Greek Tongue spread it self, and became
the Universal Language, insomuch that the <hi>Iews</hi> in
<hi>Asia, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> forgot their Hebrew, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the Greek only. But this is not the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
which I am now to speak of, which is the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
Translation of the <hi>Seventy Iews,</hi> who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the whole Book of the Old Testament into
Greek: And it seems (according to what hath been
said) there was a kind of Necessity for it, because
in the East the <hi>Hebrew</hi> was grown to be an unknown
Tongue, and the very <hi>Iews</hi> generally understood
nothing but Greek. Some have observ'd a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Disagreement between the <hi>Hebrew Text</hi>
and this <hi>Greek Version,</hi> and hereupon they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to form an Argument against the <hi>Perfection</hi> of
the Holy Scriptures; for they argue thus, There is
great reason to assert the Authority of this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,
and to believe it is True and Genuine:
Which, if it be granted, makes the Hebrew Text
to be suspected, nay it will follow thence that it is
faulty and defective, because there is so vast a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between the one and the other. If this of
the <hi>Seventy</hi> be a True Version, then the <hi>Hebrew</hi> of
the Bible which we have is not the True Original,
but is corrupted and depraved, and consequently
there is a sufficient Prooof of the <hi>Scripture's Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now because this may seem to have something of
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:46315:705"/>
Reason in it, and because the greatest Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
is about <hi>This Translation,</hi> I will insist much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
on this than on any of the others, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from the whole to evince the Truth of this
Proposition, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text is not at all faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but that it remains still in its Original Purity
and Perfection. Here first it will be necessary to
enquire into the Occasion, and into the Authors
of this famous <hi>Greek Version,</hi> and also into the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of their performing it, and from these to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of what Authority it is. <hi>Ptolomee</hi> surnamed
<hi>Philadelphus,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> about the Year of
the World 3730. erected a vast Library at <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi>
and furnish'd it with all the choicest Books
he could procure: But notwithstanding this, he
thought it imperfect till the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Bible was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to it. Accordingly by the Direction of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius
Phalereus,</hi> who was the Library-keeper, he
caused this Excellent Monument of Learning to be
deposited in it. But because he was ignorant of
the Language in which it was written, he by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
importuned the High Priest and the Rulers at
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to send him some Persons to translate it
out of the Hebrew into the Greek. Whereupon
they sent him <hi>Seventy</hi> or <hi>Seventy two Interpreters,</hi> in
imitation perhaps of that Number of <hi>Elders</hi> which
<hi>Moses</hi> was commanded to take with him when he
went up to the Mount to receive the Law. And
these Select Persons betook themselves to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
which the King set them about, and first
translated the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> and a while after the rest
of the Old Testament into Greek. This is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
allowed by the most Exact Searchers into Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
to be real Matter of Fact, as being vouched
by Writers of very good account, and whose joint
Authority in this Case we have no reason to suspect.</p>

As for some Particular Circustances which relate
to this Matter, as the Place where they met, their
Mavellous Consent in the Work, and the Time they
dispatched it in, these may be <hi>doubted of,</hi> though
for my part I see no solid ground of <hi>denying them</hi>
altogether. The whole Translation was finish'd
in 72 Days, saith <hi>Aristaeas</hi> (or <hi>Aristaeus,</hi> for his
Name is written both Ways) one that was a great
Favourite of King <hi>Ptolomee,</hi> and writ the History
of this Greek Translation of the Jewish Elders:
But this Author is thought to be spurious by<note n="1" place="bottom">De Histor. Graec.</note> 
                        <hi>Vossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
and by some other Learned Men before him.
As to the Place, <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew, <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> and
others tell us it was the Great Tower in the Isle of
<hi>Pharos,</hi> which was set up to direct the Mariners in the
dangerous Seas about <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Upon which a
<note n="2" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Gregory.</note> Great <hi>Critick</hi> turns <hi>Devout,</hi> and exerts his Fancy
very piously, observing this to be a proper Place for
such a Work, the <hi>Bible</hi> being truly <hi>a Light</hi> to lighten
the Gentile World, a Light hung out to guide all
doubting and troubled Souls in the Storms and
Tempests they meet with. And there were <hi>Distinct
Places</hi> (if you will credit some Jewish and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Writers) wherein these Interpreters separate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performed the task which they were set about.
They did the Work each of them in diverse Rooms,
say the <hi>Talmud</hi> and the <hi>Rabbins.</hi> They were put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
70 distinct Cells when they translated the Bible,
saith <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> in his <hi>Apology</hi> to the Roman
Emperor: And moreover he adds that he was at
<hi>Pharos,</hi> and saw what was left of those Cells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And with him agree <hi>Irenaeus, Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,
Epiphanius, Cyril</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.</hi>
And further, though an <hi>Arabick</hi> Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:46315:706"/>
on the Pentateuch (whom Mr. <hi>Gregory</hi> cites)
reports that the 70 Seniors disagreed in their
Translation the first time, and so were set to it
again, yet these <hi>Fathers</hi> take notice of no such
thing, but tell us that though these Translators were
separated into distinct Places by themselves, yet they
all agreed in the same very Words and Syllables.
Which they borrowed, it is likely from<note n="1" place="bottom">De vit. Mos. l. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Philo,</hi>
who had expresly said <hi>they all exactly agreed on the

(for he calls it the <hi>Chaldee</hi> instead of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>)
<hi>as if some Person stood by them and invisibly dictated to
them, although the Chaldee might be translated diverse
ways, the Greek Tongue being so copious.</hi> And he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adds that<note n="2" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> 
                        <hi>there was a Feast yearly in the</hi> Pharos,

therefore which <hi>Philo</hi> saith, seems rather to be said
on purpose to inhanse the Credit of this Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for which reason we may justly question the
Truth of it. <hi>Iosephus</hi> who purposely<note n="4" place="bottom">Antiq. Jud. l. 12. c. 2.</note> treats of
the turning the Law into Greek by King <hi>Ptolomee</hi>'s
Order, saith nothing of the <hi>Different Cells,</hi> nor
doth he represent the Interpreters as Inspired Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
And St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> who was a Searching Man,
was the first of the Fathers that opposed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
this Story, declaring that he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

                     <p>But some are not satisfied with this, but roundly
tell us that <hi>Ierom</hi> had made a New Translation of
the Bible out of the Hebrew himself, wherein he
very much differ'd from the LXX, and so he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to disparage the Cells and the Translators,
to make way for his own Translation. This is the
uncharitable Censure which<note n="2" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Mr.</hi> Gregory.</note> One gives of this

                           </gap>as</hi> he comes off

of the <hi>Cells;</hi> for this <hi>Aristaeas</hi> who is quoted
by St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> is not the genuine Author, but a
spurious one, for the Fathers quote many things
out of him which are not to be found in this Book.
But<note n="3" place="bottom">F. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Crit. Hist. l. 2.</note> Another tells us another Story, <hi>viz.</hi> that

presents us with this New Conceit, that it was
call'd <hi>the Translation of the Seventy,</hi> not from <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Translators</hi> who were the Authors of it, but
from the <hi>Seventy Iudges,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> at
<hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who authorized and approved of it.
Then, as for <hi>Iosephus,</hi> we are put off thus by Mr.
<hi>Gregory,</hi> viz. that he is wont to comply with his
Readers, and useth not to put Great and Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things on their Belief if he can help it, as appears

                        <pb n="489" facs="tcp:46315:707"/>
and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s going to Grass, &amp;c. so here
he omits the <hi>Seventy Seniours</hi> their Consenting in
that wonderful Manner in the Translating the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Bible, because it would have been incredible
to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that Persons separated and shut up
from one another should agree so exactly. To this
effect you'l <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ind that <hi>Notable Critick</hi> speaking: But
it will appear to be a very Sorry Evasion (as those
of the other Persons before mention'd are) if any
Man look narrowly into it; for upon the same
ground that he gives here, that <hi>Iewish Historian</hi>
might have omitted most of the things he relates,
because they are very <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Wonderful,</hi> and far
exceed the Belief of a <hi>Pagan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We are not then to attend to such poor Suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as these, and to swallow all that hath been rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Writers concerning the <hi>Seventy Interpreters.</hi>
Neither is there reason to disbelieve all they have
said, but in this (as in most Historical Relations)
we ought to credit what is most Probable, and to
reject the rest. We need not with <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and
<hi>Augustine</hi> hold that the <hi>Seventy Interpreters</hi> were
divinely inspired, and that their Translation of the
Bible was done in a Miraculous Manner, and that
it is of Divine Authority, which we may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ind some
Writers aiming at; but on the other hand there
is no ground to affirm that all which <hi>Aristaeas</hi> and
<hi>Aristobulus</hi> say concerning the <hi>Seventy's</hi> Version is
Fable and Fiction, as the<note n="1" place="bottom">Du Pin.</note> 
                        <hi>Parisian Professor</hi> of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi>
pronounceth, but very rashly in my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
We have no reason to deny the Chief and
General things which are related concerning the
<hi>Seventy Seniours</hi> who were employed in turning
the Old Testament into Greek; we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:46315:708"/>
to question their Skill and Ability (as to the
Main) to perform that Task, we have no reason
to deny the Authority of their Version, i. e. that
it was really Theirs, and that it is Genuine. We
are certain that it was approved of by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of all the <hi>Iews</hi> who flourish'd before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> viz. <hi>Aristaeas, Eupolemus,
Aristobulus,</hi> both the <hi>Philo</hi>'s, <hi>Iosephus,</hi> &amp;c. We are
certain that the <hi>Hellenist Iews,</hi> i. e. such as lived
among the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and read the Scriptures in this
Version, and pray'd and performed all other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in <hi>Greek,</hi> esteemed it equally with the Original,
and read it constantly in their Synagogues. We
are certain that Christ and the Apostles followed
this Translation generally: And we are sure that
the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin Church</hi> for 400 Years received
and approved it, as the most Authentick of all the
<hi>Greek</hi> Translations.</p>
                     <p>But this, you will say, makes the <hi>Objection</hi> stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
For if the LXX's <hi>Version</hi> be of such Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and yet differs from the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> then this
shakes the Credit and Authority of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
which is the Original Scripture. But I answer,
we are giving the <hi>Greek Translation</hi> of the <hi>Seventy</hi>
its due, but we do not intend hereby to wrong the
<hi>Hebrew:</hi> Yea, our design is to give unto both what
belongs to them; which I find several Learned
Writers of late are unwilling to do. When I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that the <hi>Septuagint's Version</hi> was not only here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
but is to this Day of undoubted Authority,
and is the most Authentick Greek Translation of
the Old Testament that is extant, I do not say it is
Faultless, and that it is to be equall'd with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew;
but I positively assert that it hath many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
and Mistakes, many faulty Omissions and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
many Disorders and Corruptions in it,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:46315:708"/>
and yet that nowithstanding this it is the most Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
and justly esteemed Version among all the
Antient ones, and is of great use in the Church.
It was hotly disputed of Old which of these two,
the <hi>Hebrew Bible</hi> or the <hi>Seventy's Translation,</hi> should
have the Preheminence. Some in a very high Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
extoll'd the latter, and disparaged the former;
then came <hi>Ierom,</hi> and was not content to cry up
this, but immoderately inveigh'd against the other,
and cried it down as not to be suffered. And we
have seen this Old Controversy newly started and
revived by some of late: Some on one side applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> to the Height, that they wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard
the <hi>Greek Version</hi> of the 70 <hi>Elders;</hi> others on
the other side crying up this with a vilifying of the
<hi>Hebrew Text. Ludovicus Capellus</hi> goes this latter
way, but he is outdone by <hi>Morinus,</hi> who shews
himself a Sworn Enemy to the Hebrew Text, and
at a high Rate defends the Greek Translation of
the Seventy in all things: insomuch that a Man
may plainly see he resolves to do it at a Venture,
whether there be any reason for it or no. He is
back'd by <hi>Isaac Vossius,</hi> who pretending he saw the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Text magnified and adored by some Men,
<hi>(Half-Iews</hi> he calls them) thereupon undertook to
stand up for the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> and destroy the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Hebrew Original. It will not suffice this
Gentleman to say the Greek Version of the Elders
is Divine, but from his Discourse he would have
us gather that the Hebrew Text is scarcely Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,
it being so disorder'd, so lame, so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
corrupted. These are the Extreams which
Men unadvisedly run into; that they may extol
the <hi>Greek Version,</hi> they shamefully vilify the <hi>Hebrew
Text.</hi> But I will take another Course, not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to oppose one of these to the other, but so
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:46315:709"/>
far as it is sitting, reconcile them both: Which I
will do by shewing you what is the true Difference
between these two, and whence it ariseth.</p>
                     <p>First then, the Difference which we observe to
be between the <hi>Hebrew Bible</hi> and this <hi>Greek Version,</hi>
proceeds from the mistaking of one <hi>Hebrew Vowel</hi>
for another. Though the 70 Interpreters were
sufficiently skill'd in the Hebrew, yet they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
translated it amiss because they did not make
use of the <hi>Hebrew Vowels</hi> or <hi>Points,</hi> they translated
by those Copies which had not the <hi>Points</hi> added to
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text. Some indeed have alledged the
Difference between the Hebrew and the Seventy
Version, as an Argument to prove that <hi>Points</hi> were
not antiently annexed to the Hebrew Bible; for
hence it is, say they, that there is that Variety of
Reading: The Bible was at that time without <hi>Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,</hi>
and consequently a great many Words were
capable of being read, and accordingly translated
Diversly. But this is a Fallacy, for though the
Mistakes in the Greek Version proceeded partly
from the want of <hi>Points</hi> in the Hebrew Bibles, <hi>i. e.</hi>
those Bibles which the 70 Interpreters used, yet it
doth not follow thence that no Hebrew Bibles had
Points. For so it was that all their Bibles were
not written with Points, but some Persons, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite
the writing them over, left them out. The
short is that though these were from the beginning,
(as hath been said in the Entrance of these Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
on the <hi>Scriptures</hi>) yet they were not always
used; and when they were used, they were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
carefully attended to: Whence happen'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of those Mistakes which we may take notice of
in the Version of the <hi>Iewish Elders.</hi> They either
had those Bibles which had been transcribed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Points,</hi> or they mistook the <hi>Points</hi> themselves
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:46315:709"/>
out of Carelessness or something that is worse.
The Instances of this kind are very numerous, but
I will content my self with naming a few only.</p>

thing) is the same, <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ had a <hi>Body</hi>
given him, that he assumed our <hi>Humane Nature,</hi>
that thereby he might be <hi>Obedient,</hi> and perform
the Part of a <hi>Servant.</hi> Nay, the Words themselves
are not much different, for the Hebrew Verb <gap reason="foreign">

Moreover, the <hi>Ear,</hi> which is the Organ of
Obedience and Compliance, is Synechdochically
put for the <hi>Body:</hi> nay, perhaps the Hebrew Word
<hi>Ozen</hi> signifies <hi>a Body</hi> as well as an <hi>Ear,</hi> for 'tis well

the Hebrews. I could observe to you, that it is
rendred <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> by the Septuagint, <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 16. (as well

which may convince us of the Ambiguity of the
Word. Besides, we know the Latitude of the
word <hi>Heezin,</hi> which signifies both <hi>to hear</hi> and <hi>to
obey.</hi> It might be added, that as the <hi>Opening</hi> or
<hi>Boaring the Ear</hi> signifies Voluntary <hi>Subjection</hi> or <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi>
and speaks a Willing <hi>Servant,</hi> (though not
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:46315:717"/>
this only or altogether, as I have shew'd elsewhere)
so the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> likewise denotes a <hi>Slave</hi> or <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
Person,</hi> Rev. 18. 13. Thus <hi>opening</hi> and <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
the Ear</hi> and <hi>the Body</hi> agree: and the Sense of
both put together is this, <hi>Thou hast made me Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</hi>
Thus the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> do friendly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
so that we need not say with Mr. <hi>Isaac Vossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
that the Jews have corrupted this Place to
evade the Prophecy. So in <hi>Psal.</hi> 105. 28. the Sense
was attended to, not the Express Words; for
whereas in the Hebrew it is <hi>[they rebelled not against
his Word</hi>], the Word <hi>[not]</hi> is left out in the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint,
they following (as they thought) the
Meaning of the Place, for they supposed it had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who, when
these Plagues (here spoken of) were upon them,
<hi>rebelled against God's Word.</hi> The Negative Particle
<hi>lo</hi> may here be taken Interrogatively, (as in other
Places, <hi>Isa. 9. 3. Hos.</hi> 4. 14.) and then the Words
run thus, <hi>Did they not rebel against his Word?</hi> which
is as much as to say, <hi>they did,</hi> therefore the LXX
translated it Affirmatively, <hi>they rebelled,</hi> which is
the same with our Old <hi>English</hi> Version, which we
use in our <hi>Service, they were not obedient.</hi> But if we
take [<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>] here as a downright Negative, then the
Place refers not to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but to <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron, these rebelled not against his Word.</hi> Not of
these, but of the others the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> it is likely,
understood the Text, and accordingly rendred it.
And in many other Places the Translation is not
Literal, but follows the Sense. Which is observ'd
by the Judicious Dr. <hi>Pearson</hi> in his <hi>Paraenetick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
before the <hi>Cambridg</hi> Edition of the LXX's Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
where St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Exceptions against this
<hi>Greek</hi> Version are answer'd and made void, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in several Instances that though we find not the
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:46315:717"/>
same Words there that are in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> yet we
find the like Meaning. That is sufficient, because
that was the thing the <hi>Seventy</hi> intended, for their
Business was not to tie up themselves closely to the
very Words and Phrases of the Hebrew: Which
gives us some Account of the <hi>Difference</hi> between
the <hi>Greek</hi> of the Old Testament and the <hi>Original.</hi>

                     <p>8. They sometimes insert Words without any
Ground or Occasion, Words which ought not to
be inserted. Thus though the Hebrew Text saith,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 7. Noah'<hi>s Raven went forth, going out and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning,</hi>
yet the LXX say it <hi>returned not.</hi> Here is a

the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> by saying, <hi>Noa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        </hi>'s
Raven did return <hi>unto the Ark,</hi> but not <hi>into it,</hi> but
was fed by him out of the Window. Or it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
say some, he hovered about the Ark, bringing
his Prey (Carcases floating on the Water) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
them on the top of the Ark. But this is
mere Conjecture. So the <hi>Seventy Interpreters</hi> put
in <hi>Cainan</hi> as <hi>Arphaxad</hi>'s Son, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 24. but the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> omitteth him, and puts <hi>Salah</hi> in his stead;
unless you will say with <hi>Bochart,</hi> that this and the
former Interpolation were the Fault of the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers</hi>
of the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Copies, of which before.
But further, the LXX usually add entire Sentences
of their own, when there is no need of a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
or Comment: as in the <hi>14th</hi> Psalm, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:46315:718"/>
they take several Passages out of Scripture, which
are applicable (as they thought) to that Place,
and there insert them, whence instead of seven
Verses in this Psalm, according to our last <hi>English</hi>
Translation (which follows the <hi>Hebrew</hi>) there are
eleven it it, according to the Old one used in our
<hi>Service,</hi> which follows the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> Thus in
<hi>Prov.</hi> 6. after what is said there (v. 6, 7, 8.) of the
<hi>Ant,</hi> they make bold to add something concerning
the <hi>Bee,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, &amp;c. So in
<hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and other Books, they take
a great Liberty: there are several whole Sentences
added that are not in the Hebrew, and many are
left out that are in it. To instance at present only,
in two of this latter sort, those Words in <hi>Prov. 22.

indeed unpardonable, if it be true.</p>
                     <p>9. Then, It is thought by some that in many
Places they have wilfully corrupted and perverted
the Text. It is thought at least that they did not
exactly translate some Places, because they were
loth to expose the <hi>Bible</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> This was
too rich and precious a Treasure to be imparted to
them. It would be a profaning and polluting of it
to lay it open to all Men. It is<note n="1" place="bottom">De Arcan. Cathol. Ver.</note> 
                        <hi>Galatinus</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,

Place and several others: for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the
<hi>Christ,</hi> was not come then, and there was no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy
about him; and therefore, according to my
Apprehension of things, it was too early time
of Day to misrepresent or corrupt the Bible where
it speaks of him. I rather think this was done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
namely, after our Saviour appear'd in
the World, and had been rejected by the Jews as
an Impostor. Then these Places before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and several others, began to be perverted;
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:46315:720"/>
then the Circumcised Doctors attempted to pare
off some Passages, to make some Alterations in the
Copies of the LXX which they got into their
Hands. Then it was that they corrupted the <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology</hi>
of the Bible, which was of great Use to
them. Hence it is that you find such a Difference
between the Hebrew Copies and those of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty,</hi>
about the Age of the World. It is not to
be question'd that the Jews made an Alteration in
the Years mention'd in the Pentateuch, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the Lives of the Patriarchs, more especially
those before the Flood, in that Catalogue in <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.
According to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text there were 1656
Years from the <hi>Creation</hi> to the <hi>Flood,</hi> but according
to the <hi>Greek</hi> there were about 2250. The younger
<note n="1" place="bottom">Chronolog. Sacra.</note> 
                        <hi>Vossius</hi> is a smart Advocate for the <hi>Septuagint,</hi>
and following their Computation tells us, that
4000 (wanting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ive or six) Years were expired
before <hi>Moses</hi>'s Death, and that from thence to our
Saviour's Coming were above 2000 Years, so that
Christ was incarnate at the end of the Sixth Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
or the beginning of the Seventh. The Sum
is, that according to <hi>Vossius</hi> and the LXX's Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the time of the World's Beginning anticipates
the <hi>Vulgar Aera</hi> at least 1400 Years. This length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Accompt in the Greek Bible we owe
to the Jews after the Coming of Christ, especially
after the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> They then out
of their Hatred to Christians changed the <hi>Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi>
of the Greek Interpreters, expunged the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
Aera,</hi> and introduced a larger one, <hi>i. e.</hi>
they added one thousand four hundred Years to
these Books. And their Design in doing this was
to confute the Opinion of the <hi>Messias</hi>'s Coming.
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:46315:720"/>
It would appear hence that the time was past, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the general Sense of the Rabbies. For
this Reason they made this Alteration in the Greek
Translation, though they could not effect it in the
Hebrew Copies. Hence arises the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Hebrew and Greek Computation. But
we are assured that the Sacred Chronology deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
by <hi>Moses</hi> is certain, and the Calculation true
and authentick, because the Hebrew Text is so,
(which I have demonstrated in another Place) and
consequently the Greek Version is to be corrected
by this. But this Error of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> is not
originally theirs, but is to be imputed to the latter
Jews, (I mean those soon after our Saviour's Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
who designedly and on purpose depraved the
Greek Copies of the Bible. They were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of several Interpolations, Additions, Omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Changes in the Order of the Words, and
where-ever they saw occasion to make such Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as they thought would be to their purpose.
Accordingly we find that their Translation is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
in five very considerable Prophecies, <hi>viz.
Isa. 9. 1. Hos. 11. 1. Zech. 9. 9. &amp; 12. 10. Mal.</hi> 4.
5. all of them relating to the Proof that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi>
is the True <hi>Messias.</hi> If any Man peruseth these
Texts, and compares the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the LXX's
<hi>Version</hi> together, he will easily be induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that this latter hath been corrupted by some
Jews on purpose to serve their In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>idelity and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseness
to <hi>Iesus,</hi> and that they might not be urged
by Christians at any time from the Testimonies in
this Greek Translation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> But if the present Version of the LXX be so
faulty and vicious, why is it quoted by Christ and his
Apostles, why is it followed by them generally, as was
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:46315:721"/>
before acknowledged? If the Evangelists and Apostles
who were immediately directed by the Holy Ghost quoted
this Translation, surely the Authority of it is unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> It cannot be denied that the Writers of the
<hi>New Testament</hi> often cite the Version of the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint;</hi>
yea, and I will grant moreover, that they
follow this Translation when it differs from the
Hebrew; thus St. <hi>Luke,</hi> ch. 3. v. 36. takes in <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi>
into the <hi>Genealogy,</hi> because he found it in the
LXX. St. <hi>Luke,</hi> Acts 13. 41. or rather St. <hi>Paul</hi>
in his Sermon (recited by him) retains the corrupt
Version of <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 5. The same Apostle in <hi>Rom. 3.
13.</hi> follows this Version, though it takes in four
or five Verses more than are in the Original. In
<hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 33. the same Apostle alledgeth <hi>Isa. 28. 16.
Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed,</hi> which
is not according to the Hebrew, but the Greek.
In <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 8. he quotes what <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith <hi>ch. 29.
v.</hi> 10. but not according to the Original, but the
Septuagint, though their Translation [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>]
be disagreeing with the Hebrew. In
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 15. he uses the same Words and Order
that are in the LXX, although they invert the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Words in the Hebrew, which is this in
Deut. 32. 5. <hi>a perverse and crooked Generation;</hi> but
they render it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>a crooked
and perverse Generation.</hi> So in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
that Place above-mentioned, [<hi>a Body hast
thou prepared me</hi>] although these Words disagree
with the Letter of the Hebrew, and are wholly
conformable to the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> And lastly, (to
name no more at present) when the Apostle tells
us, that <hi>Iacob worshipped leaning upon the top of his
Staff,</hi> Heb. 11. 21. it is evident (as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
shewed) that he follows the <hi>Seventy,</hi> who
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:46315:721"/>
in their unpricked Bibles read <hi>[Matteh]</hi> a <hi>Rod</hi> or
<hi>Staff</hi> for <hi>[Mittah]</hi> a <hi>Bed.</hi> Thus it is frankly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
that the Writers of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
make use of the Greek Translation of the
<hi>Iewish Elders,</hi> even when they depart from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Text. And there was good Reason for it,
because the Greek Version was at that time gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
received and approved of by the <hi>Iews:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apostles being to deal with these Men,
they prudently made use of it, and quoted it upon
all Occasions. And it was better to do so than to
give a stricter and exacter Translation of their
own, because this might be liable to Scruple and
Controversy, whereas the other was universally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
and approved of. Besides, as a<note n="1" place="bottom">

                        <hi>Christian
Rabbi</hi> observes, the <hi>Iews</hi> who were to read this
<hi>New Testament</hi> could not quarrel with the Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
because they were taken out of the Book
which was translated by those that were <hi>Iews,</hi> and
those very Eminent ones too. And then, as to
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> also, there was a necessity of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
using the LXX's Translation in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
because these understood not the Hebrew
Tongue: wherefore it was requisite to take their
Quotations out of this Translation, lest otherwise
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in whose Hands the Greek Bibles
were, observing that what the Apostles cited was
not according to These, should question the Truth
of it, and of the New Testament it self. Thus
there was a kind of Necessity of using this Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
oftentimes: but this is no Proof of its being
faultless and void of all Mistakes and Errors. The
Inspired Writers used this Version, not because
they wholly approved of it, but because in their
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:46315:722"/>
Circumstances they could not do otherwise. But
further, I answer, that though the Evangelists and
Apostles followed this Translation generally, yet
it is as certain that they did not do it always. The
Reader may see here several Places drawn up to his
View, wherein this is apparent; and among them
he will find those <hi>Five Prophecies</hi> before-mentioned,
and see that the <hi>Evangelists</hi> follow not the <hi>Seventy</hi> in
their Translation of these Texts, they knowing
that they were derogatory to the <hi>Messias,</hi> and to
the whole Gospel.</p>
                     <p>The Evangelists differ from the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

of the New Testament have occasion to quote
the Old, they sometimes keep themselves to the
Hebrew Text <hi>exactly,</hi> and have no regard at all to
the Words of the <hi>Greek Interpreters.</hi> It was long
since noted by St.<note n="1" place="bottom">De Script. Eccles.</note> 
                        <hi>Ierom,</hi> that when either St.
<hi>Matthew</hi> or our Saviour in his <hi>Gospel</hi> quotes the
Old Testament, they follow not the LXX, but the
Hebrew. Again, sometimes the Apostles follow
neither the <hi>Hebrew</hi> nor the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> but use some
Words and Expressions of their own, and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
rather than Translate. This they do to
bring the Texts they alledg closer to the purpose,
inserting such Words as give an Emphasis to them,
and shew the true Scope and Design of the Texts.
Therefore we cannot, we must not hence infe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that either the <hi>Hebrew Original</hi> or the <hi>Seventy</hi>'s <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
are corrupted; because it was not the Design
of the Evangelists to quote the very Words, but
they thought fit to use a Latitude, and to express
the Text of the Old Testament not in exact
Terms, but as to the Meaning and Import of it.

Sense and Scope of the Place, not the very Words:

Account mention'd by the Prophet, <hi>viz.</hi> its
having the Honour of being the Birth-place of our
Lord. Or if this inserting of a Negative may be
solved another way, (as<note n="1" place="bottom">Vide <hi>The Stile of Scripture,</hi> Pag. 335.</note> some have thought, and
as I have shew'd in another Place) yet still it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that the Evangelist doth not recite the very
Words of <hi>Micah,</hi> but changeth <hi>Ephratah</hi> for the

other Words and Particles varies both from the
LXX and the Original. And in many other Texts
I might shew you, that the Writers of the New
Testament do not tie themselves up to the very
Words of the Old Testament, but choose rather
to paraphrase, or give the Meaning in other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.
Thus we see the Translation of the LXX,
though it be often, yet is not always followed in
the New Testament. Likewise, although the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
in these Writings were immediately direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Holy Ghost, yet they confined not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the express Words of the Spirit in the
Original Hebrew: and we see that, though not

it was generally received, and they thought
it not fit to vary from the Translation which was
used in the Church: and we see likewise, that when
they vary from this Translation, it is no certain
Argument that they did not allow and approve of
it, for they intended not an Exact Translation
themselves, but a Paraphrase, and a rendring the
Sense rather than the Words.</p>
                     <p>The Result then of all is this, that we ought to
have that Respect and Esteem for the LXX's Version
which it deserveth: (to which purpose the<note n="2" place="bottom">J. P. Prae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> nor to depress and vilify it (as others
have done) as if it were of no Worth or Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
We ought thus to behave our selves; we must
not wholly reject it, because <hi>most</hi> of its Faults and

or Consonants, from the Ambiguity of Words,
from the Liberty which they take of Paraphrasing,
and from the Neglect of Transcribers. But on the
other hand, we ought not wholly to embrace this
Translation, because it hath fallen into ill Hands,
and hath met with some designing Men (it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
who have endeavour'd to deprave and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
it, yea and have actually done it in some
Places. We are concerned therefore to read it
with <hi>Candour</hi> and <hi>Caution;</hi> with the <hi>former,</hi> yea
the Oldest Greek Translation of the Bible that is,
because it hath been used by the Sacred Penmen of

of by us for the better understanding and clearing
the Sense of the Hebrew, and to other very good
Purposes, and because the disagreement between it
and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> may as to the Main admit of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
as I have partly shew'd, and you may
further see in the Learned<note n="1" place="bottom">Mons. Simon. Crit. Hist. Book 2.</note>

With the <hi>latter</hi> also, <hi>i. e.</hi> with <hi>Caution</hi> we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
this Version, because we know it hath justly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
the Censure of the Learned; not only of
St. <hi>Ierom</hi> the best Hebrician of all the Fathers, but
of a great Number of other Observing and Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Writers, who find that this Translation doth
frequently, and sometimes very grosly dissent from
the Hebrew, and for that Cause reprehend it with
great Seriousness. For this they all agree upon, that
where the Greek Version of the 70 is not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the Hebrew either in Words or Sense, (as
in diverse Places it is not) it is perverted and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
and where it is so, we must impeach This,
and not the Hebrew of Error and Imperfection.</p>
                     <p>That Assertion of the <hi>Younger Vossius,</hi> viz. that
the 70 Interpreters had the Authentick Copy of
the Hebrew Bible, and translated exactly by that,
but that the Hebrew Bible which we now have is
corrupted, is justly to be exploded as not only
Bold but Pernicious: wherein he extreamly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Romanists,</hi> who contend that the Hebrew
Text is depraved, that they may defend the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the <hi>Vulgar Latin.</hi> But those that are
not led by Prejudice discern that this is meer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
and that the Business of those Men is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Authority of their Church by what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
they can: Wherefore they give no heed to
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:46315:724"/>
them, and particularly in this present Matter they
despise their fond applauding of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi>
and their groundless Cavils against the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Text, and notwithstanding their impertinent Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
find reason to adhere to this unshaken
Truth, that the Hebrew Text only is void of all
Faults, Errors, Mistakes, Blemishes, Defects, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravations,
and that it is this we must ultimately
rely upon. Wherefore where there is a Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the Version of the 70 Seniours and
the Hebrew, That is to give place to This, and not
This to That. And lastly, which is the rational
Conclusion from all that hath been said, there is
no Proof of the <hi>Scripture's Imperfection</hi> from this
Disagreement between the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the <hi>Greek.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Next, I will speak of the <hi>Latin Versions</hi> of the
Bible, which even in St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s Time were so
many that they could not be numbred, as<note n="1" place="bottom">Latini interpretes nullo modo numerari possunt. De doctr. Christian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself. All the Latin Translations of the Old
Testament before <hi>Ierom</hi> were made out of the
LXX's <hi>Version,</hi> and not out of the Hebrew Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
for generally the Fathers before <hi>Ierom</hi> used
and adhered to the Greek Version. But he attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to great Skill in the Hebrew contented not
himself with these Second-hand Versions, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
and finish'd a Translation of his own,
wherein he followed the Hebrew Original. The
Chiefest <hi>Latin Versions</hi> were these three, 1. that
which was call'd <hi>Itala</hi> by St. <hi>Augustin,</hi> by St. <hi>Ierom
Vulgata,</hi> and by <hi>Gregory Vetus.</hi> This of all the <hi>Latin</hi>
Editions was the most generally received and used,
and was really the Antientest of all the Latin
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:46315:725"/>
Translations. But this was but a Translation of a
Translation, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the 70, and must have
undergone the same Censure with the Greek Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
(of which I spoke before) if it had been now
extant. But it is not, it is wholly lost: only the
<hi>Psalms</hi> remain, and as much as is found quoted here
and there in the Fathers and Antient Writers.
2. St. <hi>Ierom</hi>'s <hi>Version,</hi> for this Learned Father ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
the Errors in the several Latin Versions
(the <hi>Italian</hi> especially) which were in his time, did
(as I said before) translate both the Old and New
Testament himself: the first he wholly did by a
New Translation out of the Hebrew Original; the
second was rather a Correction and Emendation of
the <hi>Old Latin</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> Version than a New One.
The <hi>Psalms,</hi> because they were daily sung in the
Churches, and could not without offence to the
People be changed, remained the same that they
were in the Old Version. There is no occasion to
add any <hi>Censure</hi> of Ours here concerning this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,
because it agrees with the Original Hebrew.
Only we will observe that when St. <hi>Ierom</hi> had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
it, it was not presently received by the <hi>Latin
Church,</hi> but many Bishops refused it, and St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
particularly forbad it to be read in his Diocess,
so greatly did they esteem the Greek Version of the
LXX. Many that were ignorant in the Hebrew
Tongue spoke against this Translation as a meer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation,
and fell heavily upon the Author of it:
But he with great earnestness defended his Work,
and sometimes repaid the Invectives of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
with too much Bitterness. Though some
Bishops and others disliked his Translation, yet it
was authorized and approved of by <hi>Damasus</hi> (the
then Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> by whose Command it was
first undertaken) and a great Number of other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:46315:725"/>
Persons, who saw its conformity to the
Hebrew Text, and perceived it was void of those
Mistakes which the other Latin Translations aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with. whilst this Division Iasted <hi>both</hi> the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations
were publickly read, <hi>i. e.</hi> they read some
Books of the Bible in <hi>Ierom</hi>'s <hi>Version,</hi> and others in
the <hi>Italian:</hi> and this lasted till the time of <hi>Gregory</hi>
the <hi>Great.</hi> At length another Translation prevail'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> 3. The <hi>Vulgar</hi> which we now have, which is
made up of both the former, and is call'd by the
<hi>Romanists Vetus &amp; Vulgata.</hi> This by degrees got
the better of all the others in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
and was generally used by them, and is still Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick

would perswade us that both the <hi>Italian</hi> and St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's
Version</hi> and comprised in this one.</p>
                     <p>But it is evident that this is not the <hi>Old Italian</hi>
Translation which was used before <hi>Ierom</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin's</hi>
Time, for that was made out of the <hi>Greek
Version</hi> of the 70 <hi>Interpreters,</hi> whereas this differs
from it in many Places. Nor is this <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi>
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> St. <hi>Ierom's</hi> Version, because
that was exactly according to the Hebrew Text;
but this though it comes nearer to the Hebrew than
to the 70 Interpreters, yet it often varies from
the Hebrew, and adds many things to it, as in the
Book of <hi>Kings</hi> especially, and in other Places: So
that this Modern <hi>Vulgar Edition</hi> is not the Pure Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>Ierom,</hi> but mixt of his Translation and of
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:46315:726"/>
the old one which was in the Latin Church before
his Time: And this is the Opinion even of those
Great <hi>Romanists Baronius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> We
know then what censure to give of this <hi>Latin Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Bible, it is for the greatest Part of it
very Antient, and hath been used many Ages in the
Church, and is justly reckon'd to be a very Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Translation, for which reason <hi>Fagius,</hi> who was
well skill'd in the Hebrew Tongue, and <hi>Drusius</hi>
whom all acknowledg to be a Learned Critick, had
a great Reverence for this Edition, and give a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
high Character of it: and <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> prefer
it before all other Latin Translations. Yet this is
certain, it hath many things faulty in it; it leaves
the Hebrew very often, and follows the <hi>Septuagint</hi>
or the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrase,</hi> or even some <hi>Rabbin. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oas
Brugensis</hi> took notice of above six hundred Faults
in it: and <hi>Isidore Clarius</hi> a Spanish Abbot (and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>) observed eight
thousand <hi>Errata's</hi> in it. Besides that it hath many
Barbarous Words, the Sense in many Places is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and sometimes quite lost. Sometimes it
runs directly contrary to the Original Text, as in
<hi>Gen. 8. 7. non revertebatur</hi> instead of <hi>revertebatir:</hi>
And in 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 51. Omnes quidem resurgemus,
sed non omnes immutabimur;</hi> whereas according to
the Greek it should have been, <hi>Non omnes dormie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,
sed omnes mutabimur:</hi> And several Instances
might be produced of the like Nature. So far is
the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> from being absolutely <hi>Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi>
as the<note n="1" place="bottom">Sess. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> determined it to be
even before that Edition was mended. But see
how that <hi>Council</hi> baffles it self; it defines the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Latin</hi> to be the <hi>Authentick,</hi> and then orders it
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:46315:726"/>
to be Corrected, and printed again. Accordingly
the Popes set about the mending of it, first <hi>Sixtus
the Fifth</hi> put forth a mended Copy, and tied all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to that: when he was dead <hi>Gregory the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth</hi>
set about the correcting of that Edition: and
afterwards <hi>Clement the Eighth</hi> amended Pope <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>'s
in many Places. This was done after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi> had declared the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> to be the

                           </gap>ntick</hi> Copy: Which, with what we have sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested
before, is a clear Proof that it deserves not
that Epithet, but that there were and are still in it
many Corruptions. In vain therefore doth the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> prefer this <hi>Vulgar Latin Edition</hi> of
the Bible before the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek Originals;</hi>
unreasonably do the Doctors of that Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of the Defects and Errors of these, yea mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
do they urge the Disagreement between
these, especially the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi>
and thereby endeavour to accuse the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Imperfection. The Sum is (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
what the <hi>Romanists</hi> and some others that are

                     <p>Besides these 3 <hi>Old Latin Versions</hi> there are others
that may justly be called <hi>Modern;</hi> for soon after the

forth a Latin Translation of the whole Bible, for
which he is severely reproved both by Papists and
Protestants, as if it were too light and florid, too
quaint and fanciful; but if we consider the Design
of this Translator, which was to recommend the
Holy Scriptures by presenting them in a Neat and
Elegant Stile, we shall see little reason to blame
him. The New Testament was turn'd into the
same Language by <hi>Theodore Beza.</hi> And last of all,
<hi>Ianius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> did both of them jointly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate
the Old Testament out of Hebrew, and <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mellius</hi>
alone the New Testament out of Syriack: a
Work which is mightily applauded by the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

(Father and Son) though they be reckon'd

not see that it can properly be done, because they
only put forth the <hi>Antient Latin Version</hi> Word for
Word in the Old Edition, with some <hi>Corrections</hi> of
their own in the Margin, not altering the Text at

which have more or less amended the Faults of the
<hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> and have brought us nearer to the
Fountain. Upon the whole I conclude that these
several Learned Translators are all of them in their
kind very useful, some by keeping close to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
others by using a Latitude. They have
presented us, but in a Different Stile and Mode,

<hi>Preface to Pope</hi> Leo.</p>
                     <p>Having gone thus far, I will now proceed farther,
and speak concerning <hi>Our Own Translation.</hi> Our
Countrey-man <hi>Bede</hi> about 700 Years after Christ
translated the Bible into <hi>Saxon. Wickliff</hi> about
600 Years afterwards translated it into the <hi>English</hi>
Language, then understood and used by the People
of this Place. Not long after this <hi>Iohn Trevisa,</hi>
a Cornish Divine, set forth the whole Bible in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish.
In the Year 1527, <hi>Tindal</hi> translated the
<hi>Pentateuch</hi> and the <hi>New Testament:</hi> and afterwards
both he and <hi>Coverdale</hi> joined in the Work, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
the Translation of the whole Bible. <hi>Tunstal</hi>
and <hi>Heath</hi> (both Bishops) translated it anew: and
in the beginning of <hi>Q. Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign Archbishop
<hi>Parker</hi> and other Bishops made another more Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Translation, which was call'd the <hi>Bishop's Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,</hi>
or <hi>Bible.</hi> In K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Time another came
forth, which we make use of and read in our
Churches at this Day. It is certain that this last
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:46315:728"/>
                        <hi>English</hi> Translation of the Bible is in great repute
among <hi>Foreigners,</hi> and is acknowledged by them
to be the most exact that is extant. <hi>We</hi> have as
great reason to own it to be such, especially if we
take it with the <hi>Margin,</hi> where are set down the
several Senses of many Original Words, whether
Hebrew or Greek: so that where there is any
doubt of the meaning of the Word which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs,
we may take our choice. Our <hi>English</hi> Bibles
surpass all other Translations as to this, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it comes to pass that the Holy Scriptures are
faithfully and fully represented to our People, and
they are laid before them in their native Purity and
Perfection, so far as the Skill and Labours of
those Translators attain'd to at that time. And
yet I conceive it would be no Derogation to our
<hi>English</hi> Bible if it were once more revised, and the
Translation made more accurate and exact in some
Places than it is. Which leads me to the <hi>Next Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>
Part of my Undertaking, <hi>viz.</hi> the Emendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <p>I Will now, according to what I propounded in
the Entrance into this Discourse, attempt to
shew the Defect of the present <hi>English</hi> Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and at the same time to let you see how it is
to be supplied and remedied; that so this Sacred
Volume may be presented to the Readers in its
<hi>Vtmost Perfection.</hi> There is a great Number of
Places both in the Old and New Testament which
ought to be otherwise rendred, but I will <hi>chiefly</hi>
confine my self to the <hi>New Testament</hi> at present.
It is true the <hi>Margin</hi> of our Bibles doth give us <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sense</hi> or <hi>Version</hi> of the Words in many Places:
but those I shall pass by, because they are already
before the Reader's Eye. I shall take notice of
those Words only which are not otherwise transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Margin. Many <hi>Corrections</hi> of the <hi>English
Translation</hi> are attempted by that Excellent Knight
Sir <hi>Norton Knatchbull,</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi> on the
New Testament: but I have not inserted any of
them here, because I design to mention those only
which are of my own Observation, and which at
several Readings of the Bible have occurred to

                        </gap> should be rendred <hi>Swimming,</hi> for that
is the Denotation of the Word when 'tis applied
to <hi>Fishes.</hi> In the <hi>Old English Translation</hi> of the
Book of <hi>Psalms</hi> which is used in our Divine Service,
there are many things that require Correction:
but because it may be our Church retains it for the
same Reason, that when St. <hi>Ierom</hi> translated the
Bible into <hi>Latin,</hi> he did not alter the former Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> but left it entire as it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these were sung in the Publick Assemblies,
and People generally had them by Heart; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was loth to discompose so settled a piece of
Devotion; for this Reason I will say nothing here
towards the Amendment of this Translation. In
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:46315:730"/>
                        <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 13. we read of <hi>vain Oblations, the new Moons and Sabbaths;</hi> but in the Hebrew these are in the
singular Number, and therefore should be so tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated:
Particularly as to the word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> [<hi>Chodesh</hi>] the
<hi>new Moon,</hi> it will not be distinguish'd from <hi>Choda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shim,
new Moons,</hi> which you find in the next Verse,
unless you observe the Distinction between the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

<hi>Hide thee in the Dust for fear of the Lord,</hi> but not
rightly; for the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> must be
rendred either in these Words [from the Face of
the terrible Lord] or these, [from or because of
the Presence of the Lord of Terror] or thus,
[from the Presence of the Terror of the Lord],
and so it must be translated in <hi>ver.</hi> 19. where the
Words recur again. It may be some may look
upon <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> as an Expletive here, because it is so in
many Places, but we know that in many other
Places it is not; and seeing that Word here may
bear a Positive Signification, there is Reason we
should take it so. It is my Perswasion that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of the word <hi>Fury</hi> to God, in <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. 28.
<hi>Iob 20. 23. Dan. 9. 16. Mic. 5. 15. Zech.</hi> 8. 2. and
above forty times in <hi>Isaiah, Ieremiah,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
is very blameable; for the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Words <hi>Aph,
Charon, Chemah, Chamath,</hi> have no such ill Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
they only signify the <hi>Heat or Height of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
and are rendred <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> by the <hi>Seventy.</hi> But
<hi>Fury</hi> is something of another Nature, and denotes
<hi>Excess</hi> and <hi>Exorbitancy of Wrath,</hi> and even <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
it self. Therefore I apprehend our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
have done ill (though I question not their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Meaning) in attributing such a Passion to
God. Wherefore instead of <hi>Fury,</hi> let <hi>great Anger</hi>
or <hi>great Wrath</hi> be used in the Translation. Again,
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> I would be Curious I could blame our Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:46315:730"/>
for using the word <hi>Benjamite</hi> or <hi>Benjamites,
Iudg.</hi> 3. 15. (and in half a score Places more) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>Benjaminite</hi> or <hi>Benjaminites:</hi> for (as I
have hinted before) the Word being used to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> or the <hi>Sons of Iemini,</hi>
(as 'tis in the Hebrew in some Places) it must needs
have those two Letters more inserted into it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
you cannot derive it from those Words:
wherefore it must needs be <hi>Benjaminites,</hi> not <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamites,</hi>
as our English Translators have curtail'd
it. As to the Words <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Tyrus,</hi> the former
of which is to be found in <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Ioel,</hi> and the
latter in <hi>Ieremiah, Ezekiel,</hi> and other Prophets, I
conceive it were better to use one of these only,
for why should not the Name of the <hi>same</hi> Place be
express'd and written the <hi>same?</hi> Let it then be
<hi>Tyre</hi> or <hi>Tyrus,</hi> but not both. Here also I might
take notice of some Unfit and Obsolete Words,
the changing of which for others that are more in
use would render the English Version much better.

<hi>[teaching the Doctrines and Commandments of Men].
Commandments</hi> seems to be put after <hi>Doctrines</hi> by
way of Apposition. In <hi>ver.</hi> 22. instead of <hi>those

the Translation seems not to be sufficient unless

in most of this Apostle's Writings, where

but in our present English
Translation <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is absorp'd.</p>
                     <p>These are the several Places which I conceive
ought to be altered, and translated more exactly.
I say not this to impair or derogate from the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and Honour of our <hi>English Translation,</hi> much
less to condemn the <hi>Present Edition,</hi> or to expose
the Scriptures themselves; but my Design is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
them in their native Excellency and Purity,
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:46315:745"/>
and to contribute by this Critical Essay towards so
worthy an End. For it is certain that nothing can
more commend the Holy Writ than an <hi>Exact Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation,</hi>
i. e. such a one as faithfully represents to us
the Express Text of Scripture. Wherefore I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
offer the forementioned Places to the Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Learned and Judicious, and leave the
whole or part to be approved or rejected as they
shall think fit. Perhaps when our Church-Affairs
are settled, this will not seem unworthy of the
Thoughts of a <hi>Convocation,</hi> who I question not will
see that the Revising and Correcting of our English
Translation of the Bible in all or in most of those
Places (and in several others which I have not here
propounded) is very requisite. It is my judgment
that as out of the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> and the <hi>Modern Latin
Versions,</hi> one entire one might be made in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
that should be generally used in Quotations
among the Orthodox Learned, so a New <hi>English</hi>
Translation might be composed out of this <hi>Last Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
as to the main, but with such New <hi>Alterations</hi>
and <hi>Amendments</hi> as should render the Stile and Sense
in many Places more accurate, and should make it
acceptable to the most Curious English Readers.
And here I advise that the <hi>Marginal Notes</hi> of the
Present English Bible be often consulted, because
the best and most genuine Translations of Words
are frequently put there. But in the foregoing A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadversions
I have taken no notice of those dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Significations of Words which are placed
there. I have only offer'd those that have not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been observed.</p>
                     <p>In the last Place I might add something concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Division</hi> of the Bible into <hi>Chapters</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
It is not to be doubted that <hi>Moses,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Evangelists and Apostles writ their Books
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:46315:746"/>
without any such Partition, and this was the way
of all other Writers of old. But it appears that
the <hi>Books of the Prophets</hi> were divided afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Parashes,</hi> before our Saviour's Time, and this
distribution of them is often mention'd in the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muds.</hi>
This was done by the Jews for the more
methodical reading of them in the Synagogues.

                        </gap>
Books of the <hi>New Testament</hi> were thus divided:
particularly the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> was parted
into these <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>Ierom</hi> informs us.

<pb n="567" facs="tcp:46315:746"/>
from what we have at this Day. To this purpose 'tis
observable (as <hi>Heinsius</hi> and some other Criticks out
of <hi>Suidas</hi> relate) that the New Testament was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>; and so far as I can
gather from the Account which they give of these
two, the former of these was the division of a Book
into <hi>Chapters,</hi> and the latter into <hi>Verses</hi> or some such
small Portion: though at this Day there is a quite
different Sense of the Words, for the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
are the greater division, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> the lesser.
As to the Division of the whole Bible (consisting of
39 Books of the Old Testament, and 27 of the
New) into distinct <hi>Chapters,</hi> as they are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, <hi>viz.</hi> 779 in the Old Testament and 260
in the New, it was made by <hi>Lanfrank</hi> Archbishop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> about the Year 1060: others say by
<hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> who was Archbishop of the same
See in K. <hi>Iohn's</hi> Time, about the Year 1200. It
is said by others that Cardinal <hi>Hugo</hi> twenty or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years afterwards was the first that contrived
the Distinction of <hi>Chapters</hi> of the Old Testament,
for fitting the Hebrew Text to the <hi>Concordance</hi> of
the Bible, which he was Author of. The dividing
of Chapters into Verses was more lately, being
the Work of the Industrious and Learned <hi>Robert
Stephens</hi> about eightscore Years since. But whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were the first Authors of this Division of the
Bible into Chapters and Verses, it is certain that it
is not rightly made. The beginning of the <hi>10th</hi>
Chap. of <hi>Isaiah</hi> should not be cut of from the <hi>9th</hi>
Chapter, for it belongs to it, and at the Close of
the <hi>5th</hi> v. of the <hi>10th</hi> Chap. (which is so now)
the <hi>9th</hi> should end. And many other Chapters in
the <hi>Old Testament</hi> are ill divided. But especially
in the <hi>New Testament</hi> one may see that the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Chapters and Verses now in use was drawn
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:46315:747"/>
up in haste, whereby some Matters that should have
been united are severed, and <hi>vice versâ.</hi> The <hi>1st</hi>
Verse of the <hi>4th</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Colossians</hi> should
have been joined to the third Chapter: and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
of the Verses in many other Places ought to
be corrected and altered, as Sir <hi>N. Knatchbull</hi> hath
in several Instances shew'd. We may take <hi>Iunius</hi>
and <hi>Tremellius</hi> for an Example, who have alter'd
the <hi>Chapters</hi> sometimes in the <hi>Latin;</hi> and it might
be as convenient to imitate them both in the Old
and New Testament in <hi>English.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor will this Changing or any other Alteration
which I have before suggested, be any Argument at
all of the <hi>Imperfection of Scripture.</hi> This remains
entire in it self, and is not in the least changed.

                        <p>The Reader is invited to the Study of the Bible, as
he values the Repute of a Scholar and a Learned

and Diligent in searching into the Mind and
Design of the Sacred Writers: In examining the
Coherence of the Words: In Comparing Places
together: In observing and discovering the peculiar
Grace and Elegancy, and sometimes the Verbal
Allusions and Cadences of the Holy Scripture, of
which several Instances are given. He must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
be Morally qualified to read this Book, i. e. he
ought to banish all Prejudice: He must be Modest

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT remains that I conclude with a serious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress
and Invitation to the Reader, to admire
and value this Book which is so transcendently
Excellent and Compleat, to prize it above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:46315:748"/>

And shall we not think that that Sacred Volume
which contains the Laws of our Heavenly Master
and Infallible Teacher, deserves that Respect from

Scripture <hi>Mikra,</hi> i. e. <hi>lectionem,</hi> because it is to be

be someways helpful towards the understanding of

are dangerous and pernicious. Meddle with nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these: or if you have, lay them out of
your Hands forthwith, and take up the <hi>Bible,</hi> the
only Book that is Worthy of your most serious
perusal. Behold here the Book of God! There
are no Writings any where like these, none can
afford any thing comparable to them. It may be
observed that the Holy Spirit hath made use of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers

concern'd in these Messages deliver'd by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Embassadors. I have sometimes observed
that some Men of no contemptible Learning and
Reading, and who are acquainted with store of
Good Authors, have no regard for this Excellent
Book, and never think themselves obliged to look
into it. But this argues a great defect of Judgment,
(to say no worse now) for even in the Point of
Scholarship they cannot be without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of the Bible. So far as they are Ignorant
of this, they are deficient in Learning: for (as I
have demonstrated) this Book is fraught with all
Humane Learning, and gives Instructions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the choicest Arts and Sciences. Upon which
account it is of such universal use, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of them, and that daily and frequently. Let this
Holy Book be seldom out of your Hands. Though

and <hi>Directions.</hi> First, It is requisite that we furnish
our selves with other Learning to make our selves
capable of understanding the Bible. All Arts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
a Master and Teacher, even the lowest and
mechanical. All Trades and Sciences are to be
learn'd: none presumes to meddle with them till
they have been instructed in them. And yet we
may observe that all degrees of Persons pretend to
interpret the Scriptures, though they were never
instructed, never prepared, as<note n="2" place="bottom">[Sola Scripturarum ars est

to the meaning of them. But this is a gross Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
and is one cause of Mens wresting and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting
the Scriptures: They are <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, 2 <hi>Pet. 3.
16. unlearned,</hi> and <hi>unwilling to be taught,</hi> (for so the
Word imports) they neglect the means of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
they use not the proper Helps conducing to it.
Or whatever they were in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Time, we are
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:46315:749"/>
sure that now a competent Measure of <hi>Humane
Learning</hi> is required to understand these Writings:
For though they surpass all Humane Wisdom, yet
it is as true that they have strictures of all <hi>Arts</hi> and
<hi>Sciences</hi> in them, and are written in the <hi>Learned
Languages,</hi> and (as I have shew'd formerly) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in them all sorts of <hi>Words, Phrases</hi> and <hi>Idioms:</hi>
Wherefore there is a Necessity of the <hi>Arts</hi> and
<hi>Tongues</hi> for understanding this Book. In the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, of the Apostles
and Evangelists, there are the <hi>Rites, Customs, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
Opinions, Sayings, Proverbs,</hi> of almost all Nations
in the World, especially of the <hi>Antient Hebrews:</hi>
Wherefore a Knowledg of their Writings and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Monuments, a Converse with <hi>History</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities,</hi>
are absolutely requisite, especially for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
the difficult Places. And to have a true
Notion of several Passages in the <hi>Epistles</hi> of the
Apostles, <hi>Ecclesiastical History</hi> in needful, which
gives us nitice of the <hi>Hereticks</hi> of that time, or of
those concerning whom the Apostles prophetically
speak. The Writings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> are to be
consulted, and that with great application of
Mind, that we may not mistake the Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which those Learned and Pious Men give of
the respective Places of Scripture, that we may
be edi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ied by their Religious Comments, but not
imbibe any of their Errors. This which I now say
principally concerns the Guides and Ministers of the
Church, who are supposed to be Men of Learning
and Scholarship: and truly a great Part of the
Bible is more especially fitted for such. It is their
province to expound and teach this Holy Book,
which is it self a Library, and is of that Nature
that it cannot be rightly understood and explain'd
without acquaintance with the Antient Writers of
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:46315:750"/>
the Church, without skill in the Tongues, Rhetd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,
Logick, Philosophy, History, Criticism; for
as it is furnish'd with all Literature, so it requires
all to unfold it aright. As for the Apostles, tho
some of them had no knowledg in Arts and Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yet that Defect was abundantly recompensed
by the extraordinary Gifts and Endowments of the
Holy Ghost. So most of the Primitive Christians
in the Apostles Days, who were not <hi>Hebrews,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the Language in which the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was written by their Gift of Tongues. And
as for the Greek of the New Testament, it was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
known, and so was in a manner the native
Tongue both to the Jews and others of that time.
But Men are not now instructed in Strange Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
by the Spirit, nor are they born with Hebrew
or Greek, neither are they Inspired with Arts and
Humane Knowledg: and consequently <hi>Study</hi> and
<hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Long Exercise</hi> are indispensably requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site.

                     <p>Secondly, that we may read and understand the

Observing, Considerate;</hi> that we be very <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive,
Thoughtful</hi> and <hi>Diligent.</hi> This Rule may
be explain'd in several Particulars;</p>
                     <p>1. We must use great Thoughtfulness, Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and Care in penetrating into the <hi>Design</hi> and
<hi>Sense</hi> of those Inspired Writings. St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:46315:750"/>
the Rule thus,<note n="1" place="bottom">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> &amp;c. in cap. 1. ad Galat.</note> we must not only examine
the meer naked Words, and insist upon them simply
and absolutely consider'd, but we must chiefly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the Mind and Intent of the Writer. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
instead of an Absolute meaning of the Words
in Scripture, they are to be taken Comparatively,
or with Limitation, they must be restrain'd to the
Matter in Hand. As to Instance, <hi>No Man can say
that Iesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost,</hi> 1. Cor.
12. 3. <hi>i. e.</hi> no Man can say so from his Heart.
There is that Reserve implied. <hi>Where I am, ye
eannot come,</hi> John 7. 34. <hi>i. e.</hi> ye can't come yet,
but afterwards you shall. <hi>All that came before me
are Thieves and Robbers,</hi> John 1 o. 8. <hi>i. e.</hi> all False
Prophets (for he means them) are such. <hi>It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
that there is such Fornication among you as is not
so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should
have his Father's Wife,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 1. This sort of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
was not only named but practis'd among
the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> for there are several Examples in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>
Story of marrying the Father's Wife, therefore
here must be meant the more Sober Sort of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
And so in many other Places things which
seem to be absolutely spoken are to be understood
in a restrained Sense.</p>
                     <p>2. It is necessary that we be very thoughtful and
inquisitive about the <hi>Context,</hi> the <hi>Dependance,</hi> the
<hi>Connection</hi> of those Places which we search into.
We are to be exceeding mindful what the Words
refer to, what Coherence they have with what
went before and what follows. To Know the true
Sense of them we must carefully observe the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-matter:
for this is certain that Propositions
are true or not true according to this. You will
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:46315:751"/>
meet with several Instances of this in my former
<hi>Discourses</hi> on the Holy Scriptures, and therefore I
will forbear to mention any here. Only I offer this
at present as a General Rule for guiding us to the
true and genuine meaning of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>3. This Attentiveness and Care must be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd
in <hi>Comparing</hi> one Place with another, or with
divers others, if there be occasion. For (as an
<note n="1" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi>'s Priest to the Temple.</note> Intelligent Person rightly suggests) <hi>all Truth being
consonant to it self, and all being penn'd by one and the
self-same Spirit, it cannot be but that an industrious and
judicious Comparing of Place with Place must be a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
help for the right understanding of the Scriptures.</hi>
This One Rule, if well and duly observ'd, will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
us through most of the Difficulties of the Bible.
For this we may depend upon that the Scripture is
its own Interpreter, that the best Comment on this
Book is it self. Wherefore let us not be hasty and
giddy, but diligently compare the Scripture with
it self: for there are certain Texts and Passages of
the Bible that are allied to, and symbolize with one
another. The observing of this will be of great
Advantage to us. Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. The <hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi>
of <hi>Iacob</hi> concerning the <hi>Tribes</hi> receive Light
hence, and also from the particular Histories in
<hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi> concerning the Actions of the
several Tribes. This ought to be remembred that
Obscure and Difficult Places of Scripture are to be
explain'd by those that are Clear and Easy. We
must interpret those that are Uncertain by Texts
that are undoubtedly certain and plain. So as for
those that are Brief and Contracted, the best way
is to expound them by those that are Large and Full.

The Beatitudes in <hi>Luke</hi> 6. are the same, but epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized,
with those in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. and therefore there
is good reason to explain the former by the latter.
That Text of <hi>Isaiah.</hi> ch. 6. v. 9. <hi>Hear ye indeed,
but understand not,</hi> &amp;c. is contracted in <hi>Mark 4. 12.
Luke 8. 10. Iobn</hi> 12. 40. but it is at large in <hi>Mat.</hi>
13. 14, 15. and accordingly thence the Sense ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
best. And whilest we are expounding one
Place by another, we must not forget to search di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
into all the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of either, and to
consider distinctly by whom, of what particular
thing, to whom, at what time, on what occasion
they were spoken. If we be thus Industrious and
Attentive, we shall be effectually directed to the
right meaning of the Texts, and we shall find
none of those Contradictions which Unthinking
and Careless Readers through want of Collation of
Texts imagine to be in Scripture.</p>

lead us to a discovery of the singular <hi>Elegancy</hi> and
<hi>Beauty</hi> of the Sacred Stile. There are peculiar

another Tongue: or if you attempt it, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
vanisheth. Thus there is a particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and Lustre in the Phrase and manner of
Expression which the Holy Ghost useth in this
Book: it is such that it sometimes rises above the
strain of the most Eloquent Orators of <hi>Greece</hi> or
<hi>Rome.</hi> But this cannot be taken notice of by the
generality of Readers, because it is impossible to
discern it, unless with great sedulity they search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Words themselves, and by being acquainted
with the <hi>Original</hi> come to perceive the peculiar
Grace of the Words and Phrases. Thus in the
Greek of the New Testament there is in many Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:46315:752"/>
a most Remarkable Choice of Words, and a
Wonderful Accommodating them to the Matter
spoken of. Many Words in this Language are so full
and comprehensive that they cannot be express'd in
English. We do not reach the pregnancy of the

which is barely rendred <hi>Deceivers,</hi> may import the

1. Pet. 4. 15. is translated by a Pori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasis,
six Words in English for one in Greek, but
indeed this is a Compound or Double Word.
There is more in the Original, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. than
can be express'd in the Translation: We render it
thus, <hi>Take heed lest your Hearts be overcharged:</hi> But
there is a Marvellous Elegancy in the Greek which
ordinary Readers cannot perceive. For <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is
an equivocal Word, and signifies not only the <hi>Soul</hi>
and its Faculties, but that noble <hi>Visous</hi> of the <hi>Heart</hi>
well known by that Name, and also that Part of the
Body which is the receptacle of Meat and Drink,
<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Stomach.</hi> This is a Criticism not unworthy
the taking notice of, and it much inhanses the Sense
of our Saviour's Excellent Caveat here. That <gap reason="foreign">

hath this latter Signification sometimes, is evident
from the Name of that Distemper which Physicians
give to the Pain in the upper Ori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ice of the <hi>Stomach,</hi>
which being near to the <hi>Heart,</hi> affects that; whence
the Distemper is call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

It is vulgarly call'd <hi>Heart-burning,</hi> which is indeed
a Distemper of the upper Mouth of the <hi>Stomach,</hi>
and should rather be call'd <hi>Stomach-burning,</hi> which is
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:46315:752"/>
when this part of the Body is pained and disordered
by reason of some sharp and noxious Humour. The
<hi>Stomach</hi> and the <hi>Heart</hi> affecting one another by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
the former hath been call'd by the Greek
Word which is given to the latter. Thus <hi>Galen</hi>
testifies that the old Physicians used the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
in this Sense, and accordingly the <hi>Cardiac Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper</hi>
was that of the <hi>Stomach.</hi> The affinity of
these Words might also be shew'd in the Latin <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi>
and the English <hi>Stomach,</hi> which denote some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
that Great Spirit and Stubborness which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ave
their Seat in the <hi>Heart.</hi> But it most manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
(as I have shew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d) in that Language where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the New Testament is written; and St. <hi>Luke</hi> who
was a <hi>Greek Physician,</hi> and well skill'd in the Terms
of the Art, did particularly refer to this, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
uses a Word that signisies both the <hi>Stomach</hi>
and <hi>Heart</hi> properly so call'd, because this fitly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to what our Saviour saith, that they should
<hi>not be overcharg'd with Surfeiting and Drunkenness,</hi>
wherein the <hi>Stomach</hi> is mainly concern'd, nor <hi>with
the Cares of this Life,</hi> wherein the <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
are most interested: Wherefore a Word that
imports <hi>both</hi> is very elegant. A parallel Place is
that <hi>Acts 14. 17.—filling our Hearts with Food and
Gladness:</hi> where 'tis plain that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> is an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal
Term, and signifies something else besides
<hi>Hearts:</hi> for if there were not this Ambiguity in
the Word, <hi>filling their Hearts with Food</hi> would be a
very odd and unaccountable Expression. But the
Translators could not use both Senses, therefore they
set down one, and left the other to be understood:
But the Doubtful Word, according to the Subject
matter, may be applied both ways, that is, their
<hi>Stomachs</hi> were replenished with Food, and their
<hi>Hearts</hi> (as that signifies the Soul and its Affections)
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:46315:753"/>
with <hi>Gladness.</hi> And further to corroborate this
Criticism, and to shew the peculiar Excellency and
Pregnancy of the Scripture-Stile, the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
is appropriated to the <hi>Stomach in Iam. 5. 5. Ye have
nourish'd your Hearts as in a Day of Slaughter:</hi> for
here by <hi>a Day of Slaughter</hi> (as all Expositors of any
Note grant) is meant a <hi>Day of Feasting,</hi> because on
Great Festivals many Beasts were kill'd for Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and a great part of them were eaten by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificers
and their Friends, <hi>Prov. 7. 14. Isa.</hi> 22. 13.
And consequently by <hi>Hearts</hi> we are to understand
their <hi>Stomachs</hi> and whole Bodies, and by <hi>nourishing
them</hi> is meant feeding and pampering of them. The
Apostle rebukes the Gluttony and Intemperance of
the Voluptuous Men of that Age, who made every
Day <hi>a Day of Slaughter,</hi> a Day of Feasting and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling.
I could parallel this with a Passage in the
Old Testament, where <hi>leb</hi> hath the same ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Signification with <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; <hi>Comfort ye your
Hearts,</hi> Gen. 18. 5. which is spoken of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s
entertaining the Angels, and refers to the <hi>Morsel of

his Generous Provision which he made for his

several other of these <hi>Charientisms.</hi> Which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but sometimes observe likewise in other Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Writers of good Account. But that which I
remark at present is, that even the <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
Stile</hi> disdains not this manner of speaking;
which none are capable of taking notice of but
those that have some Knowledg of the Original
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:46315:755"/>
Languages in which the Sacred Text is writ. And
in several other Particulars it were easy to shew the
Gracefulness of the Holy Stile, and that singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Turn and Peculiar Air in the <hi>Original</hi> which
cannot be express'd in the <hi>Translation.</hi> There are
many Words, Phrases and Sentences which must
lose a great deal of their native Weight and Spirit
by being done into another Language. Therefore
on this, as well as on the other Accounts before-named,
we must be very Considerate and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
when we read this Divine Book.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There must be great <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Religious
Qualifications</hi> likewise: for this is the Book of God,
and therefore we must come to it with agreeable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,
Wills and Affections. Men complain that
there is a great Contention about the interpreting
of Scripture, and Different Parties can't agree:
whence they proceed to blame the Obscurity and
Uncertainty of the Scripture it self. But herein
these Persons themselves are very blameable, for
this Disagreement in the interpreting of Sacred
Writ arises not wholly from the Obscurity of it,
nor doth it proceed from the Uncertainty of it,
(as some would suggest) but from Mens Depraved
Minds and Passions. Wherefore our main Care
ought to be,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>1st.</hi> To free our selves from all <hi>Wilful Prejudice</hi>
and <hi>Perverseness,</hi> which have been the first and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Causes of misunderstanding the Scriptures.
Thus the Infernal Spirit, when he tempted our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
most perversly quoted Psal. 91. 11. and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied
it to his purpose. And from him <hi>Hereticks</hi>
and <hi>Seducers</hi> have learnt to cite and make use of
Scripture to evil Designs, <hi>viz.</hi> to uphold some Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
or Vice. What an Antient Writer of the
Church saith of one sort of <hi>Heretical</hi> Teachers,

all: their constant Practice is to strain and distort
these Sacred Writings, to construe them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their own Fancies, and to make them like an
Echo, speak what they please. Their great Work
in consulting and turning over this Volume is to
find something they may misinterpret for their own
Ends. Their Affection to a particular Cause makes
them believe and assert any thing, though never so
improbable: and then they alledg Scripture to
back it, though it be wholly foreign to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.

Those Men are to be abhorr'd that submit not
their Thoughts and Conceptions to this Sacred
Standard, who compel the Scripture to serve their
Private Opinions, who make no conscience of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a Text upon the Rack to make it speak what
it intended not, of miserably torturing it, that
they may force it to confess what it never meant.
These Persons should be reminded how great a Sin
it is to distort and deprave the Holy Writ, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signedly
to draw it to another Sense than it natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:46315:756"/>
bears. And the Penalty is as grievous as the
Crime; for, as the Apostle St. <hi>Peter</hi> informs us,
this Generation of Men <hi>wrest the Scripture unto their
own Destruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 16. Wherefore let none
presume to be guilty in this Nature, and dare to

with great <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi> Let it not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
us that some Parts of them are not level to our
Understandings. And where we cannot solve some
things, let us not arrogantly pretend to do it. It
is no Disgrace to confess our Ignorance here. I
can assure you this hath been done by the Learnedest
Heads. There is a <hi>Learned Ignorance,</hi> as<note n="5" place="bottom">Epist. 121. cap. 15.</note> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin</hi>
terms it, and we need not be ashamed to be

of this Place. That Man is impudently rash who
dares profess that he understands one single Book of the

<hi>Selden.</hi> But the contrary Temper and Spirit have
swell'd some with proud Conceits of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
some Passages of this Book, when they have
no true Apprehension of them in the least, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they have endeavour'd in a supercilious
manner to impose their crude Sense upon others,
not craving but commanding Assent to what they
have propounded. These bold Men forget what

                        <hi>It is the Glory of God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
a Matter,</hi> to speak sometimes in so dark and
hidden a manner that there is need of great search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
studying and enquiring into the things that
are said: and yet at last they remain abstruse and
unintelligible. It hath pleased God, the Wise Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the World, that the Scripture should
have Difficulties and Obscurities in it, that there
should be <hi>some things hard to be understood.</hi> But as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>
said of <hi>Heraclitus</hi>'s Writings, <hi>What he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of them was very good, and so he believed that to
be which he understood not;</hi> the like may we with
more Reason pronounce concerning the Sacred
Scriptures. The Matters which we have Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of (which are the main Body and Substance of
the Book) are Excellent and Divine; and so there
is Reason to conclude that those Parts of it which
are hidden from us are of the same Nature. There
is no occasion to find fault with the Sovereign Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, but it is our apparent Duty to lay
aside Pride, and to exercise Humility, which will
capacitate us to understand even those Great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
and Abstrusities when we have with much
Diligence and frequent Study search'd into them.</p>

Vice. For 'tis certain that a quick Brain, a subtile
Head, and a nimble Wit, are not so much required
to the understanding of Divine Truth as an Honest
Mind and a Religious Practice. To Men of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
Consciences and profane Manners the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
seem dark and mysterious, but to those of
sanctified Minds and holy Lives they are as to the
most part plain and clear. These Qualifications
render them as bright as a Sun-beam. What the
<hi>Turks</hi> are said to write on the back-side of the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,
Let none touch this Book but he that is pure,</hi> may
with great Reason and Justice be written on the
Holy Book of Scripture, and that only: for a Pure
Life is the best Commentator on these Writings,
A wonderful measure of Knowledg and Insight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
these Divine Truths which are here contain'd,
is the Effect of observing and practising the Holy
Precepts of this Book. This then we ought to
urge upon our selves, to come to the reading of
Scripture with defecate and purged Minds, with
Love to what it dictates, and with Obedience to
it. This should be our principal Care, to live
well, and to walk according to this Excellent Rule.
All our Religion, and the whole Conduct of our
Actions in this World depend upon the Scriptures:
therefore let us be directed and govern'd by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Maxims, Precepts, Promises, and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of this Book. We see Men live by Custom,
by the Dictates of Others, or by their Own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which oftentimes prove erroneous, and lead
them into unwarrantable Practices. But they would
not be thus misguided if they consulted These <hi>Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Oracles of God,</hi> this <hi>sure Word of Prophecy,</hi> if they
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:46315:757"/>
regulated their Actions by this Exact Canon. And
hereby we are certain to improve our Knowledg in
this Holy Book: for by living according to it, we
shall the better understand it; by minding the
Practical Contents of it, we shall have a full Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of its Principles and Doctrines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> That we may attain to a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the Sense of Scripture, that we may
have a due Perception of the Meaning of what is
deliver'd here, let us most earnestly invoke the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Aid and Assistance. He that reads this Book
without <hi>Prayer,</hi> can never expect to be bless'd with
a compleat Knowledg of it. For it is the sole
Work of the Divine <hi>Spirit</hi> to illuminate our Minds
effectually. There is required the special Help of
this Heavenly Instructor to direct us into Truth:
wherefore he is call'd<note n="1" place="bottom">John 16. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>the Spirit of Truth,</hi> and<note n="2" place="bottom">1 John 2. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>the
Vnction from the Holy One, whereby we know all things.</hi>
The same Spirit that endited these Holy Writings
must enlighten our Minds to understand them:
Which I find thus expressed in the Words of our,
Church,<note n="3" place="bottom">Second Homily of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note>
                        <hi>The Revelation of the Holy Ghost inspireth
the true meaning of the Scripture into us: in truth we

                        <hi>Wicked Men, however learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
do not know the Scriptures, because they feel them
not, and because they are not understood but with the
same Spirit that writ them.</hi> Seeing then a Spiritual
Illumination is requisite in order to the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
of Scripture-Truths, we ought with great
Fervour and Zeal to request it, we ought with a
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:46315:758"/>

And He that commands us to implore his

devout Supplicants. The Eyes of our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shall be irradiated with a Celestial Beam, and
we shall feel an internal Operation of the Spirit on
our Hearts, communicating Light and Wisdom.
By the Assistance of this Blessed Guide we shall not
miscarry in our Searches and Endeavours: This

some Choice Discoveries that will make us amends
