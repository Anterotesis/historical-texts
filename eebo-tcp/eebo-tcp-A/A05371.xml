            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to handle it in eight

out of holy Scripture,
that this kind of life is pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and laudable.</p>
                  <p>In the second, the same
is proued by Exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples out of
holy Scripture, and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
historyes.</p>
                  <p>In the third, the same is
conuinced by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes

                  <p>In the fourth, the same is
confirmed by Theologicall
Arguments.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth, the same is
also confirmed out of the
good &amp; commodity which
ensue of Chastity.</p>

                     <head>CHAP. I. VVherin it is proued out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that, that kind of life,
wherin some, Men or VVome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
liuing in the world, leauing of
costly apparrell, &amp; vsing plain

much the liberty of

of life is subiect vnto, &amp;
are terrifyed with more
dangers of liuing chast in
this, then in the state of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
For which cause
they may thinke it more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
to vow Chastity in the
one, then in the other. But
neuerthelesse it is to be held
as a point of faith, that this
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:8953:11"/>
State is not only lawful, but
also commendable, and of
great merit before Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God; and the same pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
not only of men, and
women, but also of youth
it selfe.</p>
                     <p>This is euidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced
out of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
wher our Lord himself
<hi>(Matth. 9.)</hi> doth openly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
this Institution. For
first when the Apostls hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the speaches of our
Blessed Sauiour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning
Marriage, answered, <hi>Si ita
est &amp;c.</hi> If such be the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man, linked vnto a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8953:12"/>
wife (to wit, that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to haue but one, neither
to be so separated from that
one, that whiles she liues he
may take another) it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not to marry, &amp; incurre
such a seruitude. To whom
our Lord replyed, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that which they had
sayd: <hi>Non omnes capiunt &amp;c.</hi>
al apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d not this speach
but only such to whome it
is giuen: for there be those
who haue made themselues
Eunuches for the kingdom
of heauen &amp;c. He who can
vnderstand this, let him
vnderstand it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="tcp:8953:12"/>
Heere our Lord spake
of single life in generall,
commending the same also
in those who liue in the
world; first, when appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the answere of his
aforesayd Apostles (who
then thought not of liuing
in Monasteryes, or being
Religious) he sayd: <hi>Non om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
capiunt &amp;c.</hi> All apprehend
not this word; as though
he should haue sayd, you
rightly infer, that it is not
conuenient to marry, but
few there be who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
a thing of so great, &amp;
high a Mystery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:8953:13"/>
Secondly, when distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
three sorts of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuches,
he sheweth, that
those do greatly please him,
who haue made themselues
Eunuches, that is to say,
who haue exempted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from Marriage, for
the Kingdome of heauen:
To wit, that being thereby
made more free, from the
burthen of such a clogge,
they may runne the faster
vnto it, and enioy it more
safely and aboundantly.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly when he saith,
He that can vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this
mystery, let him vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8953:13"/>
it: as if he should haue said,
I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straine no man, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
al, for it is a great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to abstaine from mariage
for the kingdome of God.
Therefore he who hath so
great a courage, that he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
he shalbe able to apre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
&amp; imbrace so great a
good, let him not neglect it.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore since our
Lord did not only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend
this state in generall, but
also in particuler according
to which the apostles vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
him, &amp; which might
haue been practized at that
tyme; it followeth manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8953:14"/>
that the same is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable,
and most accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
vnto God, being pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
also by those that liue
in the world.</p>
                     <p>Neither can it be said,
that our Lord spake not of
the vow of Chastity, but
onely of the simple purpose
and vse therof: for to be
made an Eunuch, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to abstaine from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
but also to bereaue
ones selfe of al ability ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and of all other carnall
pleasure; which is done in
effect also, by the vow of
Chastity. For euen as the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8953:14"/>
corporall making one an
Eunuch, cuts off all suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of carnall act, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light:
So likewise the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
making one an Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch,
which is effected by
the vow of chastity, disina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
al morall faculty so far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
that we may not vse any
such delight lawfully, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it morally impossible
(as it is incompatible with
Iustice) to do it. For what
we cannot lawfully do,
may be absolutely said, that
we cannot do, and is said to
be (iustly) impossible.</p>
                     <p>From whence it is, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8953:15"/>
holy Fathers vsually out of
this place of Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
the vow of Chastity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
a spirituall making
one an Eunuch, cannot be
otherwise effected, then by
vow. See <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in his
booke of holy Virginity,
<hi>cap. 30. S. Hierom</hi> in his book
against <hi>Iouinian,</hi> and vpon
this place of S. Matthew
<hi>cap.</hi> 19. The same is cleerly
proued out of the Apostle 1.
<hi>Corinth.</hi> 7. where he greatly
prayseth singlenes of life,
professed in diuers manners
of estate, and obserued also
in the world, and in priuat
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8953:15"/>
howses, for as then Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steryes
were not yet begun.
<hi>Dico innuptis &amp;c.</hi> I speak both
to the vnmaried, &amp; to Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
that it is good for
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to remain in that estate,
as I haue also done. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
<hi>I would haue al be as I my
selfe,</hi> that is, I desire that all
should be contine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as it wil
appeare out of that which
follows. <hi>De Virginibus &amp;c.</hi> As
for those that are virgins, I
haue no expresse commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to them from our Lord,
but I giue them Counsell
(to wit, that they remain in
their Virginity) as hauing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8953:16"/>
obteyned mercy of Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghty
God, to be faithfull,
&amp;c. And againe, <hi>Si nupserit
virgo &amp;c:</hi> If a virgin marry,
she sinneth not, but such
notwithstanding shal haue
the tribulation of the flesh,
that is to say, many troubls
cares, and afflictions &amp;c. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
<hi>Igitur qui &amp;c.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he which giueth a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
in mariage, doth well,
but he which doth it not,
doth better. Also, <hi>Beatior erit
&amp;c.</hi> she shalbe more happy
if she remaine so still (to
wit vnmarried) according
vnto my aduice, for I think
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8953:16"/>
that euen I my selfe, haue
the spirit of God. In al these
places the Apostle comends
the loue of Chastity, and
Virginity, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world
and in priuate howses, as it
was obserued at that tyme.</p>
                     <p>For in Ancient tymes,
when the faithfull were
most deuout, many follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the aduice of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
in such manner, as they
had then oportunity to do
it, as is manifest out of the
Acts of the Apostles; where
many hauing sould their
goods &amp; bestowed the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in common, imbraced
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8953:17"/>
pouerty. It is very probable
therfore, that there were a
greater nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of those who
imbraced Chastity, then
others, both because that
vertue was more noble and
profitable, and also because
there might be many poore
folks which had not goods
and possessions to sell, or if
they had, yet perhaps could
not sell them; all which
notwithstanding might
professe Chastity.</p>
                     <p>Neither is it to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but that many obliged
themselues by vow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
since they imbraced it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8953:17"/>
out of a desire of perfection
and zeale to please Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghty
God. And it is more
perfect a great deale to keep
it with an entire resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
then only with an vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and mutable purpose.</p>
                     <p>Finally also, because they
imbraced it out of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
of our Sauiours owne
aduise and commendation
therof; and that which our
Sauiour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended was the
voluntary making of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
Eunuches, which is
effected by vow, as hath bin
said before. The same is col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
also out of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8953:18"/>
1. <hi>Tim. 5. Adolescentiores
viduas &amp;c.</hi> Take none of the
younger sort of widowes,
&amp;c. which is meant that
they should not be admitted
into the function or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of <hi>diaconisses,</hi> or into the
number of the <hi>Alumnae</hi> or <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pills</hi>
of the Church. <hi>Cùm enim
&amp;c.</hi> for that, saith <hi>S. Paul,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they haue liued licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
in Christ, at last also
they will not sticke to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
frustrating their former
Faith: that is, they will
breake the vow of Chastity
which they had made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
for the word <hi>Fayth,</hi> is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8953:18"/>
taken in this place for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi>
or obligation dew by
promise: as for example, to
<hi>give</hi> ones <hi>Faith,</hi> is to giue
ones promise, to <hi>keepe fayth,</hi>
is to keepe promise, to <hi>fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
sayth</hi> giuen before, is
to breake promise, and a
promise made to God, is a
vow.</p>
                     <p>From hence it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that it was a custom in
the primitiue Church, for
Widdowes also to vow
Chastity, so that without a
mortall sin, &amp; being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of damnation, they could
not marry againe: besides
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8953:19"/>
that, euery act of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence,
yea and the very
marriage it self was iniury
against Christ; for so much
is signified in these words,
<hi>After they haue liued licentiously
in Christ,</hi> that is to say, after
they haue liued lasciuiously
and luxuriously, wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Sauiour Christ,
to whome they had bound
themselues by vow, and
were become espowsed to
him, at length also they
will not sticke to marry.
After this manner the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of <hi>Carthage</hi> the 104. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
and S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> vpon
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8953:19"/>
this place, and <hi>S. Hierome</hi> in
his epistle to <hi>Herontia de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nogamia,</hi>
and others, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
it.</p>
                     <p>This place is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
&amp; pondered of all such
as haue made vow to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God of perpetuall
Chastity, for that without
being guilty of eternall da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
they can neither
marry (especially with an
intention to consummate)
nor otherwise enioy carnal
delight, which also is the
opinion of all the Fathers,
who interprete this place
to be of promise made vnto
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8953:20"/>
God by the vow of Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>Finally wheresoeuer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture commendeth
Virginity, it speaketh in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall;
neither is it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
vnto those alone,
who liue in Monasteryes,
And all rewards and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
of Virginity there
rehearsed, belong vnto all
holy Virgins, as in the 3.
<hi>chap.</hi> of the Booke of <hi>VVise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
Faelix est sterilis &amp;c.</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
is she that is barren and

of soules that are

<hi>(sequi Agnum quocumq, ierit)</hi> to

To Eunuches which keep
Gods diuine Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is promised an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
name, and a high
place, and a degree in the
Citty of Almighty God.</p>
                     <p>Some will obiect that,
that place of the Apostle 1.
<hi>Tim.</hi> 5. saying: <hi>Volo iuniores
nubere &amp;c.</hi> I would haue the
younger sort to marry, to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8953:21"/>
bring forth Children and
keep house &amp;c. makes cleare
against that which we haue
sayd. To this I answere,
that it is not to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of all Widdowes that
are young, but only of those
which cannot liue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and are not otherwise
obliged by any vow: for it
is better that such should
marry, then liue inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
and giue scandall to
the vnfaythfull, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
insinuateth in the
same place.</p>
                     <p>Also the holy Father S.
<hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his 15. <hi>Homily</hi>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:8953:21"/>
vpon the 1. to <hi>Timothy,</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
there of such widows,
who being freed from the
yoake and gouernement of
their husbands, liue disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly,
become idle, pratlers,
wanton, curious, running
vp and down to their nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghbours
houses, &amp; the like.
And it is manifest out of the
text it selfe that the Apostle
speaketh of such, when he
sayth: <hi>Volo &amp;c.</hi> I would haue
the younger sort to marry.
<hi>S. Ambrose</hi> also in his booke
of <hi>VViddowes</hi> explicateth <hi>S.
Paul. Pro remedio suasit nuptias
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8953:22"/>
&amp;c.</hi> he perswaded Marriage
as a remedy, but not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
it as a choice. S.
<hi>Hierome</hi> in his 8. Epistle to
<hi>Saluina,</hi> asking: <hi>Cur nuptias
Paulus indulserit &amp;c.</hi> Why did
<hi>S. Paul</hi> fauour Marriage?
Presently he addeth: <hi>I am
quaedam &amp;c.</hi> Some haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
declined after Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
whereby we may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
sayth S. <hi>Hierome,</hi> that
these speaches rather signify
a helping hand to be lent to
those that are fallen, then
the reward of a crowne to
those which stand firme:
See then (sayth he) what
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8953:22"/>
these second Marriages be,
which are yet to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before the condition of
a Brothell-house: for some
haue declined after Sathan;
therefore a young Widdow
which cannot, or will not
containe her selfe, let her
rather take a husband then
the diuel. So <hi>S. Hierome</hi> Out
of which it appeares that it
is not conuenient for all
young Widdowes to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but onely such who
are subiect to the vices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
named, to wit, in
whome there is manifest
danger of Incontinency, or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8953:23"/>
which cannot liue chast,
or will not vse meanes to
do it.</p>

who liuing in the world at

free from being subiect to

&amp; this either before,
or immediatly after her
Marriage.</p>
                     <p>And truly, if before her
marriage (as it is most likely
she did, and <hi>S. Augustin</hi> in his
Book of holy virginity <hi>cap.</hi>
4. doth thinke most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
then she contracted
not marriage afterwards of
her owne accord, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moued thereunto by
diuine Reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by which
also she was assured that
there should be no danger
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8953:24"/>
to loose her virginity, and
that her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d also should
binde himselfe by the like
vow of Chastity; wherfore
she neuer consented neither
expresly, nor in effect to any
matrimoniall Act. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
that in the contract of
Marriage, there is power
giuen to the husband ouer
his wiues body, yet by this
reuelation she was assured
that it should in her neuer

But if she made her vow

the same, but in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as she referred her selfe
wholy to the prouidence
of Almighty God, relying

                     </p>
                     <p>Moreouer it is manifest
out of <hi>S. Cyprian, S. Ambrose</hi> &amp;
<hi>S. Hierome</hi> with other holy
Fathers, that there were in
those ages infinite who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated
their virginity to
Almighty God, although
they entred not into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries,
but dwelt either
in their Parents howses, or
in their owne, retayning
the vse of their proper
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8953:28"/>
goods, or els liued many
together in comon.</p>
                     <p>The same appeareth also
out of the testimony of <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus
Manichaeus</hi> in <hi>S. Augustine,</hi>
in his 30. boke against <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
the 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> where <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus</hi>
thus obiecteth. <hi>Necvidetis
hinc &amp;c.</hi> Neither do you see
heere, both your virgins to
be noted of being deceaued
by the doctrine of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
and your selues to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his Prelats, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiously
alwayes incite
them to this profession, by
your perswasions, that there
is almost now in your
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8953:28"/>
Churches a greater number
of Virgins, then of marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
women.</p>
                     <p>By which speach two
things are to be noted, that
Bishops &amp; Prelates, euery
where through the whole
world, did earnestly incite
those that were vnder their
charge to the profession of
Virginity, and that the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of those who did pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blikely
professe Virginity,
was as great as those that
were marryed. See <hi>S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
in his 30. booke of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
where he sheweth the
same most euidently.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="44" facs="tcp:8953:29"/>
Among these also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were very eminent and
wealthy, as the daughters
of Senatours, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and many of them had
wayting women to follow
them when they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
as it appeares out of
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> in his 8. Epistle
to <hi>Demetriades,</hi> where he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
warneth such Mistresses,
that, as they themselues go
modestly in their apparell,
so they should cause their
women of attenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce also to
auoyd vanity in their atty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
&amp; see that their habits
were modest and graue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="tcp:8953:29"/>
Besides many Fathers
haue written of the attyre,
and discipline of Virgins,
as <hi>Tertullian, S. Cyprian, S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,
S. Hierome,</hi> in diuers
places of their workes. All
which they directed spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
vnto such, as liuing
out of Monasteryes at their
owne gouernment, imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
virginity. And the said
holy Fathers do warne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that they should not be seen
in publique without veils,
and ciuilly accompanyed;
that they should not vse se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
ornaments; that they
should abstaine from pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8953:30"/>
and vanity in their
cloathes; that they should
auoyde vnprofitable mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
marryages and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets;
that they should giue
their almes with a pure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to the reliefe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,
and such as were in
distresse. All which things
it is manifest do belong to
such as are at their owne
disposing, and retaine their
proper substance.</p>
                     <p>Neither haue we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examples of Chastity in
single or vnmarryed folkes,
but also euen in those the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
which are marryed,

which to auoyd tediousnes

euidently, that this

professing Chastity, in the

a man incorruptible

it passeth not from our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes

being the propriety of an

also our bodyes incorrupt

&amp;c. Virgins haue before

excells marriage, by how
much heauen doth earth,
and Angells mortall men.
And againe in the 12. <hi>chap.</hi>
Humanity since it is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour

to those happy spirits
the Angells, as farre as it is

their perfection. And
how? Angells marry not,
nor take to them wiues, no
more doth a Virgin. Angels
wayting alwayes about the
throne of Almighty God,
do serne him: so doth a
Virgin. Wherefore S. <hi>Paul</hi>
calls them away from all
cares, that they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
imploy themselues
in the seruice of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

to be distracted. Againe,
<hi>chap.</hi> 37. Dare any one after
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8953:36"/>
all this compare marriage
with virginity, or but once
bring the one in presence
of the other? S. <hi>Paul</hi> suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not this, who interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
a great distance betw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eene
these two, where he

                        <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> in his first booke

is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that her Spouse

therwith. For who is it,
that hauing found so great
a good, will leaue it? For
thy Name is an oyntment
powred out, wherfore
yong virgins, and maides
haue loued thee, and taken
thee vnto them. Finally,
that is not my saying, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
those which neither

of marryed women,
with the lowest and least

                     <p>Admit (saith he further)
that some great woman
should boast of her fertility
&amp; the fruit which she hath
brought forth: by how
many the more Children
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8953:38"/>
she hath beene deliuered of,
by so much the greater haue
beene the panges &amp; paynes
which she endured. Let her
reckon the ioy which she
hath of her children, and
withall she may count li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewise
the troubles which
they haue caused her. She
marryeth and weepeth: &amp;
what wise vowes are these,

A Virgin is one to
whom God hath giuen her
to be so, and therefore she is
his guift, she is the reward
of her Parents &amp;c. A virgin
is the oblation of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by whose dayly sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

our Sauiour Christ loueth
Virgins the more, because

it is a token of greater grace

sayth: Virginall integrity
is an Angelicall portion
and a perpetuall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of incorruptibility in
a corruptible body. Let all
fertility of body giue place
vnto this, and all conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
of marryed persons
yeild vnto it; for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
is not in our owne
power, the later liueth not
in eternity. The liberty of
our will extendeth not
vnto bodily fruitfullnesse,
Matrimoniall Chastity is
not found in Heauen.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8953:40"/>
They certainely shall haue

affirme (wheras those mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

that holy Virginity

as that which is

excelleth that which is
better, and accompanyed
with ioy euerlasting.</p>
                     <p>These &amp; many other
thinges, holy Fathers haue
written in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of virginity, by which the
excellency &amp; worth therof
may be beeter knowen and
esteemed, no one vertue or
estate of life being comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8953:41"/>
with so great affection,
&amp; consent of holy Fathers,
as this.</p>
                     <p>Heereupon, especially
in former ages, an infinite
multitude haue imbraced
it, in so much that <hi>S. Ambrose</hi>
in his 3. booke of Virgins
affirmeth, That in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne
&amp; Africa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Churches,
there were more virgins
consecrated to Almighty
God, then wee haue men
borne in our parts heere.
And yet notwithstanding
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind is not therby dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
but increased. If
any one (quoth he) imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8953:42"/>
that the number of
mankind is diminished by
the multitude of virgins,
let him consider, that where
there are few virgins there
are also the fewer persons,
and where the number of
them is more frequent who
are louers and imbracers of
Virginity, there also the
number of men is more
great. Consider how many
<hi>Alexandria,</hi> &amp; al the Easterne
parts, with the Churches
also of Affrica, was wont
euery yeare to consecrate:
fewer men are heere begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
then there virgins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8953:42"/>
the reason wherof
is, that God will not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
with liberality:
but if the Parents offer him
a Child or two, he renders
them eight or ten, graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
fruitefullnes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
Childe-bearing to
such as are mothers, and
filling their howses with
his blessing. Therfore euen
as faithfull paying of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,
&amp; liberality towards
the poore, bringeth not
pouerty, since God by his
prouidence prospereth and
increaseth our substance, &amp;
maketh our fields the more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8953:43"/>
fruitfull, as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<hi>Serm. 219. de tempore;</hi>
so the loue and affection to
virginity hindreth not the
world, nor wasteth the
number of secular Persons,
but obteyneth it a longer
benediction.</p>

                  <div n="4" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. IIII. The same is proued also, by
reason.</head>
                     <p>THE errour of <hi>Iouinian</hi>
was, that Virginity
did not excell Marriage,
which he meant by virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
taken absolutely and
generally, whether it were
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8953:43"/>
professed by persons liuing
in the world or in Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
He therefore who confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
that virginity professed
in the state of Religion, is
to be preferred before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
but not that which
is imbraced in the world, is
at least halfe a Iouinianist,
because he is halfe of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion;
nay rather he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
to be altogether of
the same minde, and really
a Iouinianist, because he
denieth, that Virginity is
of it own nature better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Marryage, wherein the
whole Errour of Iouinian
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8953:44"/>
about this matter consisted.
For if of it owne proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it were better, it would
followe, that the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
also professed in the
world, would be better.
See <hi>S. Augustine Cap. 28. ad
Quod-vult-Deum,</hi> and <hi>S. Ierome</hi>
in his 10. booke against the
same <hi>Iouinian &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it were not laudable
and meritorious to vow
Virginity, liuing in the
world, either it should be
for the great difficulty and
morall impossibility of kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
their vow in that es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
or els because Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8953:44"/>
is not better then marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ag;
for no other reason can
be imagined. Not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
for it is an heresy of
the heretikes of these our
daies, who for the difficulty
therof, affirme, that such a
vow is not to be made, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
the person know that
he is peculiarly inspired
with the guift of continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
Not the latter, for it is
the errour of <hi>Iouinian</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said.
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the gift of
Chastity, it is to be held as
a point of faith, that this
gift will not be wanting
to any who will resolue to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8953:45"/>
liue chaste, if he do as much
as lyeth in him to obteine
the same of Almighty God.</p>
                     <p>If there be so great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to liue chaste in the
world, in so much that it
is not meritorious for a
man to bind himself therto
by vow; then such a vow is
of it owne nature vayne, &amp;
of no effect to him that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
it, and so he may freely
breake that which is of
such difficulty, as seemes
morally impossible. But
this kind of reasoning may
by no meanes be admitted;
to wit, that such a vow is
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8953:45"/>
of it owne nature vaine &amp;
of no effect, and that it may
be broken without a most
grieuous sin. See the aboue
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned testimony of the
Apostle 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>It is very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
&amp; meritorious for yong
men also remayning in the
world to vow chastity, yea
the Church bindeth al such
as haue taken holy Orders
therunto. Therfore if men
do it, &amp; that it be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
in them to do so; why
should it not be the like for
women, such as are yonge,
both Maydes, &amp; Widdows
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8953:46"/>
especially, since men liue in
far greater danger by means
of their greater freedome
of conuersation, and their
lesse bashfullnes, togeather
with more frequent occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of temptation. From
whence we see, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds,
that more men which
vow Chastity in the world
do offend against their vow
then women: yea there are
very few of that sexe who
vowing Chastity in the
world do violat their vow:
in so much that oftentimes
in a great citty, for the space
of many yeares, you shall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8953:46"/>
not hear of any such: which
is a signe, that it is a matter
more easy for women to do
then for men; &amp; yet we see
that men do laudably take
vpon them such vowes:
neither can they by any
meanes be excused fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
being once vndertaken.</p>
                     <p>If it be meritorious to
keep Virginity in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
why is it not also in the
World? For the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of the place alters not the
merit of the worke, but the
excellency it selfe thereof,
and a deuout will vnto it:
and this pious inclination
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8953:47"/>
may be had as well out of
the state of Religion, when
a Virgin purposeth with
her selfe to abstaine from
Marriage, and to consecrate
her virginity to Almighty
God, that she may serue him
the more perfectly, that she
may follow the counsell of
our Sauiour Christ, that she
may imitate our Lord, and
his most blessed Mother,
that she may apply all her
thoughts and affections to
heauenly things, and to the
health of her soule; for the
excellency of the worke is
equall on both sides. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8953:47"/>
there is no reason, why
the profession of Chastity
in the World, should not be
meritorious, as well as in
Religion.</p>
                     <p>It is not only commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
in Monasteryes, but
also in the world, to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good workes, as to
pray, to fast, to giue corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and spirituall almes,
to chastice our body, and to
bind our selues by vow
thereunto. Then if other
good works loose not their
worth &amp; esteem, nor their
merit before God by being
done in the world; why
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8953:48"/>
should Virginity, and single
life? Yea, as it is the more
prayse-worthyto be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
and to abstaine sitting
at a banquet, and to be able
to bridle our appetite, euen
in the very middest of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations;
so likewise may
it be a deed of greater merit
to liue chastly in the world,
where occasions of falling
are more frequent: As for
example, when there are
lawfull reasons why such
occasions might not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently
shunned, which
otherwise they would haue
willingly auoyded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:8953:48"/>
The state of being Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,
and to be shut vp in
Monasteryes, is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with the complexion
of euery one: yea a great
many, either are not apt for
this state, by reason of the
weakenes of their body, or
for other causes, or oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
their mindes are not
easely wonne to it, and that
most commonly for diuers
sufficient reasons, which
it is not necessary to reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le:
and who now should
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straine such to marry, or
to enter into Monasteryes?
Why should it not be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8953:49"/>
for them to keepe their
virginity in the world, &amp;
to vow themselues vnto it?
Is it either because they wil
not, nor cannot ascend to
the highest degree, that they
must be therfore constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to stay in the lowest, &amp;
may not keep a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
both? No man will
thinke so, except he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with the spirit of <hi>Ioui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian.</hi>
The counsells and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices
of our Sauiour Christ
are not so necessarely vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one to the other, but
that one may be followed
without another, and by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8953:49"/>
themselues, in diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
Wherfore as those
who desire to obserue the
state of Pouerty, are not
bound vnto Chastity; so
also those which imbrace
Chastity, must not therfore
of necessity keep Pouerty,
or Obedience, or shut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vp in Monasteryes.</p>

                  <div n="5" type="chapter">
                     <head>CHAP. V. The same is proued out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
which this state of
life, being prosessed, both in
the world and in Religion,
doth bring with it.</head>
                     <p>THe Cause why this
state of life is so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8953:50"/>
by holy Fathers,
as well in the one as the
other, are the manifold
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities which it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
therwith. For in both,
it is an imitation of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
life; in both it is the
making of our body as it
were a burnt-offering to
Almighty God; in both it
is a spirituall Marriage, in
which Christ is the spouse;
in both it freeth from the
irksome slauery of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and from the troubles
which belonge vnto it;
in both it deliuereth the
minde from infinite cares
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:8953:50"/>
&amp; troubles; finally in both
it maketh it free, and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to apply it selfe vnto
God, and to dwel as it were
mentally and spiritually
with the Blessed, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of heauenly things.</p>
                     <p>First it is an imitation
of Angelicall life, as holy
Fathers euery where do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer,
out of the opinion of
our Lord <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. Because
as Angells marry not, nor
are troubled with carnall
concupiscence, but are euer
attent to diuine matters, &amp;
entertaine themselues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
in them; so in like
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8953:51"/>
manner Virgins are sayd to
anticipate the glory of the
Resurrection, because mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
after the Resurrection
shall cease.</p>
                     <p>Virginity is a burnt-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering:
for as in a burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring
the thing sacrificed is
killed, and afterward all of
it consumed in the honour
of God, that no part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
remaines for humaine
vse: so likewise a Virgin
must first kill all carnall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
in her selfe, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
offer vp her body,
mortified after this sort by
the fire of Charity, to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8953:51"/>
God, and reserue
no part thereof to any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
or carnall vse.</p>
                     <p>She is a spirituall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
because by vow she is
bound vnto God as to her
husband: for as the band of
carnall marriage is not to
be loosed; neither also is
that of spirituall: yea that
of spirituall Marriage, is
much more indissoluble;
for it cannot be loosed by
death it selfe, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in all eternity. Againe,
as carnall marriage is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
for the mutuall enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and comfort of both
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8953:52"/>
persons, and the bringing
forth of children: so this
Marriage is made, that the
soule may please God the
better, and receaue help &amp;
comfort backe againe from
him, and that it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
more familiarly, and
with the greater delight
with Almighty God, as
with its Spouse.</p>
                     <p>And finally, to the end
that hauing receaued seed
of diuine grace from him,
an immortall and glorious
issue may be begotten to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
in the world to come:
wherein spiritual Marriage
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8953:52"/>
is farre more happy then
carnall; for the later is to
the end, that of impure and
corruptible seede, another
man may be begotten, and
that but to enioy a mortall
life, and thereby subiect to
infinite miseryes: but the
other is to the end, that out
of diuin seed a mortall man
should beget, not another
mortall man, but himselfe,
to an immortall and happy
life. Therefore he perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himselfe first vnto this
marriage, and afterward by
word &amp; example profiteth
others. To this may be lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8953:53"/>
added, that as in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
marriage, titles, and
dignityes, and all the goods
of either is communicated
to both: so likewise in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
the goods and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nityes
of the espoused, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
also to the Spouse.</p>
                     <p>The desire of a wife
is, that she may haue a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
who is faire, noble,
rich, powerfull, and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and if it happen that
she get such a one, she thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
her selfe happy. But
how much more happy, is
a Virgin whose husband is
the most fayrest, most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8953:53"/>
most rich, most power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
most gentle, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Lord of heauen and
earth, of Angells also, and
of men. See more of this in
S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his first booke
of Virgins.</p>
                     <p>For as much as belongs
to the benefits and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dityes
of holy Virginity,
they are generally three.
The first is, that it freeth
the mind from innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
troubles and afflictions
vnto which the state of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
either by meanes
of the wife or by meanes of
the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is subiect vnto;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8953:54"/>
which the Apostle insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. when he
speaketh in this manner of
those which are marryed:
<hi>Tribulationem carnis habebunt
huiusmodi;</hi> such shal haue the
tribulation of the flesh.
And first of all, is the serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of the wife, by reason
that she hath not power of
her owne body, &amp; is made
subiect in all thinges to her
husband, must endure his
frowardnes, his insolencies,
his banquetting, dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kenes,
iealousy, suspicion, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency,
adultery, taunts, &amp;
blowes. Also she must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8953:54"/>
him, sticke alwayes to
him, obey him and serue
him as his slaue; so that
many slaues in the world
haue a more tollerable bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
then some wiues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
marryed; whilst he
spends her wealth and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
at dice, at play, in
drinking, banquetting, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall
giuing, improfitable
bargaines, improuident co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and diuers other
wayes, which his wife is
not able to remedy.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer he leaueth
the charge of prouiding for
the whole house-hould to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8953:55"/>
her, and yet alloweth not
wher withall sufficiently to
do it; and bringeth her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentymes
euen into that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
that she groweth
halfe desperate. In the mean
tyme being oppressed and
ouercome with too much
impatience, she often cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
her husband, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
al il hap to befal him,
and desireth nothing more
then his death. Neither are
these thinges rare and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
but the whole world
is full of them.</p>
                     <p>Now if we should add
vnto all this, the troubles
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8953:55"/>
that come continually by
meanes of children, there
would arise euen a whole
world of miseryes &amp; affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
And although in
the carnall Act of marriage
there seemeth to be now &amp;
then a little pleasure: yet of
it owne nature, it is both
vncleane (as a thing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we differ not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a beast)
and also full of shame and
immodesty; &amp; in a moment
it is past, and afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with innumerable
discommodityes. For pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after Conception,
there followeth a kind of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8953:56"/>
irkesomnes, idle dreames,
giddines, vnsetlednes of the
head, melancoly, conuulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the hart-stringes, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
longings after meates,
and a generall perturbation
of nature.</p>
                     <p>Then follow the paines
of child-bearing which are
both violent to the sense,
&amp; oftentymes endure long,
and to many bring death
also; and then the Child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
borne, with what great
care and solicitude must
it be brought vp, vntill it
come to be of some strength
and perfection of nature.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8953:56"/>
How many tymes a day
must it be made cleane,
fed, made vp, apparrelled,
laid to sleepe, rockt in the
cradell, taken out againe to
giue it suck, and be held
out. How many times must
it be flattered and intreated
with faire speaches &amp; with
a thousand pretty hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and flatterings, to make
it leaue crying, or to sleepe?</p>
                     <p>These are the contynu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
exercises of such as be
Mothers, and in such they
are imployed, not on ly all
day long, but also most part
of the night, so that they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8953:57"/>
can scarce take any rest but
with often interruption.</p>
                     <p>I omit the sluttishnes,
the ill sauour, the weeping,
crying, &amp; brauling, which
they are constreyned dayly
to suffer. I omit allso the
cares and troubles, which
they haue when their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
begin to grow big, &amp;
to be exposed to diuers cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the world. What
great greefe they haue, if it
chaunce they should mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
and dye; if by euil
company they should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured
to villany and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty;
if they should proue
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8953:57"/>
stubborne and disobedient
against their Parents; if they
should spend &amp; wast their
Parents goodes at play,
drinking, or at any other
vnlawful game; if without
their Parents consent they
should marry.</p>
                     <p>To these afflictions the
whole life of all such as are
mothers, is always subiect;
for albeit the Parents be
very deuout and religious,
yet it happens oftentymes
that the children be wicked
and lewd, and with their
misdemeanours, and ill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
torment their Pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8953:58"/>
as wee haue examples in
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> in <hi>Noë</hi> and
<hi>Cham,</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Ismael,</hi>
in <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> in <hi>Iacob</hi>
and many of his sonnes, in
<hi>Dauid, Amon,</hi> and <hi>Absolom,</hi>
with infinite others: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
since sacred virginity
deliuers from all this, it is
deseruedly to be numbred
amongst the greatest bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitts
that are.</p>
                     <p>Another commodity of
virginity and single life is,
that it freeth the minde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
all cares of gouerning a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
of increasing the
stocke and wealth of their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8953:58"/>
estate, of marrying their
children, &amp; of leauing them
ample Patrimonyes; for of
these foure things all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
are for the most part
most careful &amp; sollicitous;
yea commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly their minds
are so wholly addicted and
giuen to such businesses, as
they can scarce euer thinke
seriously on God, or things
belonging to the good of
their soule.</p>
                     <p>These things they keep
alwayes in minde, in these
things they spend all their
thoughts and affections,
these things so waste and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8953:59"/>
weare out all the ability &amp;
powers of their mindes, as
they haue no strength left
to consider, or thinke vpon
things that are eternall.</p>
                     <p>Greatly therfore is the
misery of this estate to be
pittyed; for the bondage of
the mynd is more hurtfull
a great deale, then that of
the body; and the losse of
good thoughts, is a greater
domage, then the losse of
money.</p>
                     <p>The third co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of
virginity and single life is,
that it maketh the minde,
being freed from the cares
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8953:59"/>
and troubles of Marriage,
more fit &amp; prepared to serue
Almighty God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
its owne safety: and
this is the greatest good of
this life. For which cause it
is commended specially by
the Apostle the 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.
where he saith, <hi>Mulier innup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
&amp;c.</hi> A woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnmarryed,
and a Virgin thinketh on
what belongeth vnto God,
that she may be holy, both
in body and minde.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing better
nor more healthfull vnto
our soule the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to serue God,
and to endeauour the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8953:60"/>
of our soules well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.
To this purpose were
we made, &amp; adorned with
these noble faculties of our
soule, Vnderstanding, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and Will. Wee haue
not receiued these to imploy
them about transitory and
seruile matters, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
fruit at al, but to addresse
them to eternall and celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
things, for our great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifit
and aduantage. All
earthly things are to base &amp;
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptible for our minds
(which is aboue all visible
things) to fixe, and exercise
it selfe there about. The
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8953:60"/>
shortnes it selfe of our life,
togeather with the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinty
&amp; necessity of dying,
might iustly recall vs from
the care of temporall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
&amp; addresse our thoghts
to the solicitude of thinges
eternall. Whereupon the
Apostle 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. sayth: <hi>Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus
breue est &amp;c.</hi> Time is short,
it remaines, that such as
haue wiues, be as those who
haue them not; and those
who mourne, like those
who mourne not; &amp; those
who reioyce, like those
who reioyce not; and those
who buy, like those who
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8953:61"/>
possesse not; and those who
vse this world, like those
who vse it not; for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion
of this world passeth
away &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>By which wordes he
teacheth vs, that we should
be no more affected and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to transitory things,
then as if they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
vnto vs. We ought to
haue care of nothing so
much, as to auoyd eternall
punishment, and attaine
to euerlasting ioyes: for in
comparison of these, all the
good or ill of this world,
ought to be of no ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ount:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8953:61"/>
So that if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but madnes practised
in the world, this would
be the greatest, to neglect
the highest and euerlasting
thinges, &amp; to follow that
which is base and transito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
with so great hazard of
eternall damnation.</p>
                     <p>Therfore as that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of life is miserable, and
to be auoyded by all wise
men, which intangleth the
mind with care of base &amp;
earthly thinges, howsoeuer
glorious and honourable
they seeme: So on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
is that state happy &amp;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8953:62"/>
most desirously to be imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
which freeth the mind
from all these cares &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and affoardeth it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
to meditate on hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
things, and to apply
it selfe to the obtayning of
its own welfare. And such
is single life, as it hath byn
shewed.</p>
                     <p>Neither in women on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but also in men single
life hath all these effectes:
for most of those thinges
which we haue sayd before
of women, haue place also
in men: yet men in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
are most commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8953:62"/>
to more discommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dityes
and inconueniences
then women, because the
whole care of maintayning
the houshould, and of the
greatest busines lyeth vpon
him; and infinite disdaines
of the wife, offences, iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losies,
suspicions, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints,
and frowardnes are to be
endured, as <hi>S. Hierome</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuteth
it, very elegantly
out of <hi>Theophrastus</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
in his first booke
against <hi>Iouinianus,</hi> whose
words it seemeth heer good
to set downe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fertur, inquit, Aureolus &amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:8953:63"/>
Heer is brought (quoth he)
a little goulden booke of
<hi>Theophrastus</hi> written concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
marriage, in which
he asketh this question,
Whether a wise man should
marry a wife or no? And
when he hath defined, that
if she were fair, wel broght
vp, of good Parents, and if
she were healthfull &amp; rich,
with these conditions a
wise man might somtimes
marry; he presently infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:
But all these seldome
match togeather in marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
therfore it is not behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for a wise man to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8953:63"/>
&amp;c. And then he sets
down diuers reasons which
the same Philosopher alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
for his opinion.</p>
                     <p>First (quoth he) it
hinders the study of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy;
for no man can serue
his bookes and his wife at
once. There are also many
thinges which are necessary
for the vse of Wiues, as
gay apparell gold, Iewells
expenses, wayting women,
variety of houshold stuffe,
guilded horse-litters, and
coaches. Moreouer you shal
haue all the night long no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but pratling, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8953:64"/>
that this Dame
weares better cloaths when
she goes abroad then she:
This Lady, or Gentle wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is much honoured and
respected of all wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
she comes; whilest I,
poore soule, am despised &amp;
contemned of euery body.
Why did you looke so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
on my Neighbours
wife? Why did you talke
with her mayd? Are you
come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Market, what
haue yee bought? &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Her husband cannot haue
a friend or companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
straight she thinketh that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8953:64"/>
the loue of another is her
hatred. If there were a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Maister in euery town,
men should neither forsake
their wiues, nor be able to
walke with so great a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
If she be poore, it is
cost to help her, if rich, a
torment to endure her.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer there is no
choice of a wife, but what
a one soeuer you chance
to take, if she be colerique,
if a foole, if deformed, if
proud, if slutrish, what fault
soeuer she hath, we learne
that afterward. A Horse,
an Asse, an Oxe, a Dog, the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8953:65"/>
worst slaue a man can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine;
his apparell also,
his kettles, his chayres, his
cups, his earthen pots, all
these a man may proue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he buy them, only his
wife must not be shewed
before she be had, for feare a
man should so dislike her,
that he would neuer haue
her.</p>
                     <p>You must alwayes be
looking on her face, and
commending her beauty,
for feare least if you looke
on another, she thinke that
her beauty displeaseth you.
She must be called Mistresse
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8953:65"/>
and her Birth-day must be
made a Holy day: you must
sweare by her health, and
you must pray that she may
out liue you: you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
her that nurst her,
and her also that bare her
when she was a little one,
her seruant, her brother-in-law,
her little dandling,
her pretty Page, her hyred
Proour, and her Eunuch
forsooth, for the longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
and more security
of lust (vnder all which
names are prettily couched
Adulterers.) And whome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
of all these she affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8953:66"/>
he must be beloued
too, euen by those to whom
they are vngratefull.</p>
                     <p>If you commit the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
of the whole
house to her charge, you
must be her seruant. If you
reserue any part of it to
your selfe, she thinks you
wil not trust her, &amp; straight
turneth into hatred, and
scoulding, and vnles you
beware of her betymes, you
are in danger to be poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                     <p>Old women, Wisards,
brokers of Iewels and silke
apparel, if you admit any of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8953:66"/>
these into your house, you
are in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of cuckolding:
and if you forbid them,
you do her wronge to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
her.</p>
                     <p>But to what end is it
to watch her narrowly,
when a wife that is vnchast
can neuer be restrained: &amp;
if she be chast, she ought not
to be restayned; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of chastity is but an
vnfaythfull keeper. She on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is truly to be named chast
who can be otherwise if she
wil. A faire wife is a bayte,
aswell in other mens eyes,
as in his that hath her. A
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8953:67"/>
slut wil sooner desire others
then they her. It is a hard
matter to enioy that alone
which many men seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and it would be a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to haue such a one, as
no body would vouchsafe
to affect. Yet it is a lesse mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
to haue an ill fauoured
wife, then to keepe a faire
one true. There is nothing
safely possest by one, which
of euery body is wisht for.</p>
                     <p>One sollicits with his
comlynes, another with his
wit, another with his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santnes,
another with his
money: by some meanes or
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8953:67"/>
other at last the Fort will be
taken, which is on euery
side so strongely beseiged.</p>
                     <p>But it may be obiected,
that it is necessary for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to haue a wife, to take
charge of the expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ses of his
howse, or to be a comfort
to him when he langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth,
or to auoyd solitary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
To this I answere, that
a faithfull seruant obeying
the authority of his Maister,
and doing his busines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his will, dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
of matters a great deale
better then a wife, who
thinketh that her Mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8953:68"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth in doing that
which is against <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>er hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
will, that is to say,
to do that which she hath a
will to, not that which she
is commaunded to do.</p>
                     <p>And as for attending &amp;
comforting a man when he
is sicke, his friends and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
or such poore soules
as he hath made beholding
vnto him, may better do it
then she, who vpbraides
him, as it were, with the
teares which shee sheedes
for him, yea sells the very
filth and drosse therof, in
hope to be his executour.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8953:68"/>
And by this boasting of her
carefullnes, neuer leaues
him, til with her perpetual
trouble, she driues him into
vtter desperation.</p>
                     <p>But if her finger chance
to ake, he must be sicke for
it, and neuer budge from
her bed side. Or if she be a
good wife, and of a sweete
disposition (which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
is a rare bird)
he must groane with her,
whilst she is in child bed, &amp;
be payned with her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>As for the auoyding of
solitarines, a wise man can
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8953:69"/>
neuer be alone; he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
all those which are,
or euer were good, in his
thoughts, &amp; freely placeth
his mind on what he will.
That which he cannot do
with his body, he imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
with his thoughts, &amp;
if there be sarcity of men to
conuerse withal, he talketh
with God; he is neuerlesse
alone then when he wants
all company.</p>
                     <p>Besides it is a most idle
thing to take a wife, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to haue children by
her that his family may not
be extinct, or that he haue,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8953:69"/>
help &amp; ayde to his old age,
and also to know who shall
in herit that which he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
behind. For what is
one the better when he is
going out of the world,
that another is called by his
name, when as a sonne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
presently be like his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and there are an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of other men
also perhaps called by the
same name. Or what boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it to nourish those at
hom, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we hope may be
helps to vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are old,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perhaps they either dy
before vs, or become of such
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8953:70"/>
a peruerse disposition, as
they will not succour vs; or
if they themselues come to
maturity of yeares, perhaps
they thinke their parents
liue to longe.</p>
                     <p>And as for heires, our
friends &amp; our neighbours
whom we loue, are better &amp;
more sure heyres vnto vs,
being chosen thereunto by
vs freely, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those whome
wee are constreyned to
haue whether we will or
no: though indeed it be a

to make our selues our
owne heires, (by doyng
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8953:70"/>
good workes whilst we
liue, (for otherwise we do
but abuse the same) then to
leaue it, being gotten all
by our owne industry and
pains, to the vncertein vses
of any others whatsoeuer.</p>
                     <p>These reasons and the
like <hi>Theophrastus</hi> discussing,
what good Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might
he not make ashamed of
such vanities and troubles,
whose conuersation ought
to be in heauen, and who
dayly sayth <hi>Cupio dissolui &amp;c.</hi>
I desire to be dissolued and
be with Christ: as though
he who may be a coheyre
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8953:71"/>
with Christ himself, should
desire to haue man to be
his heire, and should wish
for children, and be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghted
in the succession of
his posterity whome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
Antichrist shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert;
when notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

and <hi>Samuel</hi> preferred others
before their own children.
Neither yet did they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> children whome

                     <p>Thus farre are S. <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
words, who afterward
confirmeth the same with

single life in the world is to
be preferred aboue Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,

doth deliuer a man; and
what aboundance of helpe
it affoardeth to a man, to

and obteine a high degre in

things if they should be

great also are the merits of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:8953:72"/>
enduring them: which
merits such as are virgins
cannot haue. Whence the
Apostle also 1. <hi>Tim</hi> 2. saith:
<hi>Saluabitur &amp;c.</hi> She shall be
saued, by bringing forth
children &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I answere, that Parents
may be moued with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
affection, to beget and
bring vp children: to wit,
with a meere humaine and
naturall affection, &amp; with
a spirituall or diuine. A na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
affection is, when
any one desireth children
for the conseruation of his
name &amp; family that he may
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:8953:73"/>
haue heires to whome he
may leaue his goods; that
he may out-liue his owne
death in his posterity; that
he may be honoured in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
that he may haue comfort
and help by his children.
All these are humaine res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
and affections, and
therfore of no merit, or es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeme
before God; yet of
their owne nature they are
not ill, but indifferent.
Wherfore those who out of
such affection do contract
Marriage, or beget childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
or bring them vp begotten,
merit nothing before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:8953:73"/>
God, and loose all
their labours and charges
which they are at, as far
forth as this; to wit, that
they shall not receiue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
reward for them, but
onely a temporall comfort
or comodity. For as an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
affection is not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious
before Almighty
God, no more also is the
work which followeth out
of it, although it be freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and laborious.</p>
                     <p>In like manner to loue
and follow Honours, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Magistracy, Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
and Pleasures for the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8953:74"/>
commodity, splendor and
sweetnes which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
in them, although of
it selfe it be no sinne; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
likewise is it of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert,
but rather apperteineth
to the delight of such things
as are the concupiscence of
the flesh, of the eyes, and
pride of life, and which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
out of a corrupt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
not out of the inspiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of diuine grace.</p>
                     <p>The same likewise is
to be sayd of the affections
of Parents, whereby they
wish and procure these co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
&amp; pleasures vnto their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8953:74"/>
children. For euen as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
they desire and obtayne
these things for themselues,
they deserue nothing at the
handes of Almighty God;
no more likewise doe they
when they doe the like in
their childrens behalfe: yea
this affection is not onely
not meritorious before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, but also it is
not so much as a worke of
any vertue.</p>
                     <p>For first of all, that it
not a worke proceeding
out of any diuine or infused
vertue, it is manifest, since
it may be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d also in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8953:75"/>
themselues, and the
most wicked persons that
liue. Also that such affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
proceed not out of any
morall or Philosophicall
vertue it is plaine, for they
respect not their obiects,
as they are honest and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
as the natures of
such vertues require, but as
they are delightfull &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious,
or honourable.</p>
                     <p>Whence it is, that no man
by such an affection becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
praise worthy, which
is the propriety of vertue.
As no man is worthy of
prayse, for that he loueth or
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8953:75"/>
getteth riches, honors, plea,
sures, or for louing his child
because he is fair, or because
he is like him, for singing
wel, dancing wel, speaking
well, or being indewed
with such like ciuill orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or qualityes. Al such
affections are only naturall
and indifferent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of no desert or merit in
the sight of Almighty God
before his Tribunall seate.</p>
                     <p>Therfore as he which
giueth almes to the poore
prodigally, and vayneglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to make himself ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
and esteemed the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8953:76"/>
more of men, according to
the wordes of our Sauiour,
shal haue no reward before
Almighty God, but recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
all his reward in the
prayses which he getteth of
men in so doing: So those,
which marry for respect of
pleasure or riches, those
which desire to haue chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or to bring them vp
to haue contentment, who
day and night onely take
care, how they may leaue
them a large and ample in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
that they may
promote them to honours,
offices, dignityes, or weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8953:76"/>
marriages, deserue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
before God, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
their reward in the
temporall contentements,
which by this meanes they
procure, either to themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
or to their children.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to speake
truely, their labours and
cares are all lost; neither do
they reape any fruit at all
to be accounted of from all
this; for nothing is to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
of any great valew,
but that which is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.</p>
                     <p>All temporall things
are of small account, passing
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8953:77"/>
away as shaddows, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
most vnworthy to
spend al the vigour &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
acts of our soule about
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which were ordained
for things eternal. Heerupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
holy Scripture euery where
calleth vs from the loue and
desire of riches, honours,
and pleasures, and telleth
vs that such as are poore,
meeke &amp; oppressed, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
happy.</p>
                     <p>Neither are all these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and paines of Parents
onely vnprofitable, but they
are also hurtfull, and the
originall cause of infinite
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8953:77"/>
euils. From hence it is, that
there are such an infinite
nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of men in the world,
who damne there owne
soules (which otherwise
might haue been saued) for
their childrens sake, to mak
them rich, or to promote
them to Honours. For those
that wil become rich as the
Apostle witnesseth, <hi>fall into
temptation, and the snare of the
deuill, and into many vnprofitable
and hurtfull desires, which send
them head long into damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;
destruction; for couetous desire is
the roote of all mischeife.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Marriage doth comonly
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8953:78"/>
force men headlong vnto
this desire, for al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would
make their children rich, &amp;
leaue them a large inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
so that deseruedly
also for that cause, that state
of life is not to be greatly
desired, which maketh all
our paines and cares, most
commonly, not only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
for our welfare,
but also dangerous and
hurtfull vnto vs, if it be not
auoyded. Yet it followes
not from hence, that wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke
is euill: for neither
Riches or Honnors be euil
but good, which God also
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8953:78"/>
sometymes bestoweth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
vs, for the reward of some
good deed or other; and in
tymes past haue beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
also to those few
who obserued the law: but
it is dangerous I say, to loue
such pleasures and delights,
to follow them, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
al our endeauors onely
in attayning of them, since
they are but base &amp; meane,
and do hinder the loue and
desire of things eternall, &amp;
inta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle the minde in many
snares.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, though
Matrimony of it selfe be
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8953:79"/>
good, and ordeyned by
God, yet it drawes with it
many cares and troubles,
which through humanie
frailty hinder the health
of the soule, that it leades
men secretly into many
sins, and oftentimes vnto
eternall damnation. Thus
much of the humaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
out of which many
men inclyne vnto Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
                     <p>The spirituall affection
is, when Parents desire to
haue children, to the end
that they may instruct them
in the feare of God, that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8953:79"/>
they may teach them to
serue him, that they may
increase the number of the
faithful, that by them many
deeds of deuotion may be
done, that God may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored
by them and the like:
these affections rise not
out of nature; but out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ne
inspiration, and are
worthy of a man, as he is a
Christian.</p>
                     <p>Whence I confesse that
Parents who with this kind
of affection desire to haue
yssue, and bring them vp,
as aforsaid, do merit great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before Almighty God;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:8953:80"/>
&amp; the wife also who with
such a spirit desireth Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
shalbe saued by the
bearing of children. And
in this manner the wordes
of the Apostle are to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. But yet
it seemes to be more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that the Apostle in that
place speaketh not of the
merit, but of the estate and
office of Marriage; &amp; that to
be also the meaning of this
saying, <hi>Saluabitur &amp;c.</hi> She
shalbe saued, by doing the
office of Marryage, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauouring
to haue chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
for so the Greeke text
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:8953:80"/>
doth import, as the learned
do teach.</p>
                     <p>So likewise to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<hi>cap. 4. 5. &amp; 11. Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi>
is sayd to be the Father of
those that belieue, by hauing
the foreskin or Prepuce cut
off, that is to say, by those
which are in that Estate.
And in 2. <hi>Cor. cap. 6. Per
gloriam &amp; ignobilitatem &amp;c.</hi> By
glory and ignobility, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy
and good credit, that
is to say, in prosperity and
aduersity. The same is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the words which
the Apostle addeth, <hi>Saluabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
&amp;c.</hi> She shal be saued (saith
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8953:81"/>
he) by the bearing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
if she perseuere in faith,
in loue, &amp; in holynes, with
sobriety: therefore he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth
the cause of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
fayth, &amp; to loue &amp;c. not
to the procreation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
yet I confesse also that
this very deed is meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
likewise, if it be done,
as we haue sayd, out of
spirituall affection: but it is
otherwise, if it be done out
of humaine only.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer if this estate
and the offices thereof, be
chosen &amp; performed with
a spirituall affection: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8953:81"/>
single life is much
better and more meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
both because it remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
innumerable occasions
of distractions, imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and sinnes, by which
the estate of Matrimony is
hindred in the offices of
deuotion; and also because
it affoardeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of
conuersing dayly with God
and of being attent to diuin
matters. Wherefore a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
oftentymes may merit
more in one day, then a

without pride also, or
any secular ornaments, such
as may represent the state
wherein they liue, and the
forsaking of the world: by
which euery man that sees
them, may know that they
are Virgins, and haue an
intent neuer to marry. For
by this meanes they shall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyd
all importunityes and
troubles, which suiters are

She must not only be a
Virgin really, but also she
must be knowne, and be
belieued to be such a one:
so that no man who seeth
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8953:83"/>
her who is a Virgin, may
haue any doubt whether
she be so or no. For why
should she go adorned, or
attyred as though she had,
or would haue a husband?
let her rather feare to please
any, if she be a Virgin; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let her seeke her owne
danger, since she preserues
her selfe for a better &amp; more
deuout purpose &amp;c. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought a Virgin to be
delighted with the shew of
her owne beauty, or to take
a glory in her owne person
or comlynes, since she hath
no resistance or war against
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8953:84"/>

                     <p>Afterwards he allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
for their Riches and
Nobility, for which res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects
they thinke that it is
conuenient for them to go
more richly attyred; whose
excuse he refuteth at large,
shewing in what thinges
they should imploy their
wealth.</p>
                     <p>To their habit also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
a Veyle, with the
which it is meete that a

when she goeth abroad,
least either she might see
that which were not befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
or her countenance
should be perceaued of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
For how many, I
pray you, haue there beene
in the world, who only by
sight haue either perished
themselues, or killed others?
In so much that they must
take principal heed of their
eyes. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> hath
written a particuler Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this subiect of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
veyling and couering
their heads, which he iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:8953:85"/>
to be a thing so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that he sayd: It was no
lesse then a passion of lust,
to a vertuous Virgin, euery
tyme that she exposeth her
selfe to publique view; to
wit, because that therby she
with her face open, casting
her eyes freely about to see,
&amp; to be seene, is easily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
in spirit; &amp; that the
very gazing it self is a signe
of an vnchast mind.</p>
                     <p>And againe afterward:
The desire not to be veyled
or couered is not a chast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
but admiteth somwhat
that belongeth not vnto a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:8953:85"/>
Virgin; as also the desire to
delight others inbeholding
her; for true, entyre, and
pure Virginity feareth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much, as it owne
selfe, yea it endureth not the
eyes of other women that
delight in gazing, since the
eyes of it selfe are farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from such; it flyeth
to the veyle of her head, as
to a helmet, &amp; as to a buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
which defendeth her; it
is a protection against the
blowes of temptation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the darts of scandals,
against suspitions, &amp; whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering,
and emulation, yea
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8953:86"/>
and against Enuy it selfe.
After this put on the armor
of bashfullnes, entrench thy
selfe within the bull warke
of modesty, build vp a wall
for thy sex, which keepeth
in thyne own eyes, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not the eyes of others
to enter. Thou hast marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Christ and deliuered thy
body to him, thou hast es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poused
the maturity of thy
yeares to him. Goe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
it is Christ that bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
those who are marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to veile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
much more those
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:8953:86"/>
which are espoused vnto
him.</p>
                     <p>For this purpose the
womens attyres of <hi>Brabant</hi>
are very fit, which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by them <hi>Huekes,</hi> which
the very noblest Matrons
of that Country vse, when
they would not be knowne
in any publike assembly.</p>
                     <p>Let vs now come to the
exercises which holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
prescribe to be vsed
by virgins. These are fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
prayer, reading of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
bookes, and handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke,
in the dayly vse and
variety wherof they may
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:8953:87"/>
spend all their tyme most
profitably.</p>
                     <p>Fasting is as it were the
foundation &amp; ground of al
other vertues; for by this
the roote of many tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and by consequence
of many vices, is cut of; the
minde is made more fit to
conuerse dayly with Almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghty
God, with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
&amp; fruit, from whome
it conceiueth all its good,
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence al Saints for the
most part haue deriued the
begining of a spiritual life.
By fasting, I meane not such
fasting, as should weaken
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:8953:87"/>
or impaire nature: but such
wherby the body becomes
more healthfull, the mind
more quicke, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
more subiect.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Hierome</hi> commendeth
greatly this exercise in his
8. Epistle to <hi>Demetriades, de
custodia virginit.</hi> After (saith
he) diligent taking heed
of impure thoughts, you
must put on the ornament
of fasting, and sing with

&amp; chastity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which no man shall
euer see God. It affoardeth
staires to such as wil ascend
to the top; &amp; yet if it should
be alone, it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to crowne a virgins &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>In which words it is to
be noted, that fasting is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
by <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and Chastity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vertues. It is called
Sanctification, because it
maketh others vertues flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
and works their effects
the better; and by this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
it sanctifieth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="163" facs="tcp:8953:88"/>
It is called Chastity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canse
it procureth cleanesse
of body and hart, wherin
consist all other vertues,
without which no man
shall see God.</p>
                     <p>And that this fasting must
be moderate, &amp; such as may
not weaken the body, but
refresh &amp; quicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mind,
S. <hi>Ierome</hi> warneth vs in these
words, when he saith: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I prescribe to yow
immoderate fasting, or such
abstinences, as should be
altogether without meat,
by which bodyes that are
tender and delicate may be
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:8953:89"/>
quickly brought out of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alth,
and grow sicke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they haue layde the
foundation of this holy
conuersation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> in his first book
of virgins saith, that the
sparing of meate, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
from drinke, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a man to be ignorant
of vice; for it maketh him
to be ignorant of the causes
therof. Therfore let this be
rather a fast of sobriety the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
affliction.</p>
                     <p>Prayer also, vnder which
is conteyned the meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of heauenly things, and the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8953:89"/>
mysteries of our faith, is
principally necessary. First,
because by this wee must
obteyne dayly supply of
Grace, wherby we may
both resist temptations and
fulfill Gods diuine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
and perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
to the end: wherfore our
Lord warneth vs, that we
alwayes pray, to wit, as
much as conueniently we
may, and as far forth as the
fraylty, and necessary affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
of this world will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
vs: for our perseueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
and eternall safety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth
on Prayer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="tcp:8953:90"/>
Secondly by Prayer &amp;
Meditation we list vp our
mynd to Almighty God,
we place our selues in his
sight and presence; wee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
his Maiesty, his Power,
and his Wisedome, his
Goodnes &amp; his prouidence,
his Mercy and his Iustice;
we adore him, and praise
him, we giue him thankes
and blesse him; there we
deale with him about the
busines of our Saluation,
and call to mynd all things
which he hath both done
and suffered for vs.</p>
                     <p>For this cause especially,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:8953:90"/>
a Virgin must abandone
Marriage and secularity, &amp;
imbrace the state of holy
Virginity, according to
the Apostole, to wit, that
she may thinke of these
things which belonge to
our Lord, that she may be
holy in body and spirit, that
she may behaue her selfe
worthily in the presence &amp;
conuersation of Almighty
God, that she may sticke so
close vnto him, that she
may neuer be drawn away:
and as our Interpreter tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slateth
it, that she may haue
free leaue to beseech any
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:8953:91"/>
thing of our Lord, without
hinderance.</p>
                     <p>Heere are delights and
spirituall comforts; in this
consisteth as it were the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
of our soules; by these
things our conuersation is
in heauen, and we are made
to enioy the society of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:
without these what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
we do, is dry &amp; bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
for all comfort and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
ioy proceedeth from
the attentiue consideration
of diuine matters.</p>
                     <p>From whence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
that those who apply
not themselues with great
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:8953:91"/>
loue and desire, to Prayer
and Meditation, they must
needs remaine dry, or at
leastwise they shall neuer
tast the most excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of the spirit. By Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
&amp; meditation the mind
is exercysed, and groweth
zealous in the function &amp;
habit of other vertues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the guift of grace is
more aboundantly obtey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by it, whereby the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of vertue is made more
easy and delightfull.</p>
                     <p>Hence the Royall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
saith, <hi>Viam ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c.</hi>
I haue runne the course and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:8953:92"/>
way of thy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
whilst thou dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedst
my hartwith ioy. And
why? because the vanity
of the world, &amp; the worth
of vertue, and the Charity
of God, and the reward of
life to come, are shewed
therby vnto vs. The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of all which, must
needs greatly stir vs vp to
all offices of vertue, and to a
diligent care of our owne
saluation.</p>
                     <p>Reading of Spirituall
bookes also is commended
by the holy Fathers, and
commeth very neere to the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:8953:92"/>
exercise of Prayer. For as
by Prayer we obteyne the
conuersation euen of God
himselfe; so do we it also
by reading of spirituall
books. Whereupon <hi>Isidorus</hi>
in his 3. booke of Sentences
the 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> saith: Who
alwayes wil conuerse with
God, must pray often, and
read much; for when we
pray, we speake familiarly
vnto God, but when we
read, he speaketh vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>And afterward be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
that Spirituall profit
also proceedeth from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and reading.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:8953:93"/>
Lastly handy-worke is
greatly comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, for this
is an especiall and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Exercise for three
things. The first is, therby
somewhat to release and
refresh our minde; for we
cannot alwayes attend to
read or pray, but it is
needfull to recreate our
minde by intermixing of
labours sometymes betwe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e,
least we should be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearyed:
and this is done
most conueniently by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
imployments, in
which the mind is little or
nothing at all buysied.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="tcp:8953:93"/>
Whence it followeth,
that this manner of variety
becommeth most gratefull
to our weake and changea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Nature, and hath beene
vsed in all ages by men and
women, such as were holy;
and likewise it helpeth to
auoyd idlenes, which is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
to be taken heed
of, by all such as endeauour
to attaine to the perfection
of a deuout and holy life.
For as <hi>S. Ierome</hi> in his Epistle
to <hi>Demetriades</hi> sayth, there
is nothing more hurtfull to
any deuout purpose then
Idlenes, which doth not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:8953:94"/>
only omit to get new per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but also wasteth that
which was gotten before.
And Blessed <hi>Ignatius</hi> saith,
<hi>Otium omnium malorum &amp;c.</hi>
Idlenes is said to be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of all mischiefe;
for a minde that is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
is open to all sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
and impressions of
the diuell.</p>
                     <p>Wherby sometymes it
commeth to passe, as <hi>Seneca</hi>
witnesseth, that although
the body be guiltlesse, yet
the mind being idle, falleth
into a thousande sorts of
lewdnesse. Wherfore it is
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:8953:94"/>
good to be alwaies doing
of somewhat, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
our minds about one
good action or other, that
the diuell may alwayes find
vs busy.</p>
                     <p>Lastly it is beneficiall
for the health of our body,
and to giue good example
also, and to releeue others.
For no Almes is so pleasing
to Almighty God, no guift
so acceptable, as that which
is earned by our owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
S. <hi>Hierome</hi> discourseth
at large of this point in his
epistle to <hi>Demetriades,</hi> which
for breuities sake I omit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="176" facs="tcp:8953:95"/>
It resteth now to speake
of the third, to wit of the
vse of their Riches. Holy
Fathers set downe the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
at large, how amongst
Virgins, those who are
wealthy shold imploy their
meanes; to wit, not in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
apparell, not in
banquetting and pleasures,
not in adorning their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,
not in Iewels, pearles,
rings, bracelets, not in rich
&amp; curious houshould-stuff,
not in riot and excesse of
brauery aboue their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
but in the succour &amp;
releife of the poore, and of
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:8953:95"/>
such as are seruants of God.</p>
                     <p>S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his booke
<hi>De disciplina &amp; habitu Viginum,</hi>
discourseth at large vpon
this thing: I will only al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge
one sentence for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uityes
sake: <hi>Locupletem te dicu
&amp;c.</hi> Thou boastest (quoth
he) that thou art wealthy
and rich, and thou thinkest
that it behooueth thee to
vse the riches which God
hath permitted thee to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse.
Do so, vse them, but
let it be in such thinges as
may concerne the health of
thy soule. Vse them, but in
that which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8953:96"/>
thee to vse them,
&amp; in which he hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee &amp; taught thee how
to doe. Let the poore find
thee to be rich, and those
that are needy perceaue thee
to be wealthy. Put out thy
Patrimony to vse, into the
handes of Almighty God.
Giue meate vnto Christ,
that it may be lawfull for
thee to sustayne the glory of
thy Virginity. And to the
end that it may be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by our Lord, beg it of
him by the prayers of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Lay vp thy treasures
there, where no thiefe can
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:8953:96"/>
dig them out, where no
wait-layer, or night-rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
can breake through.
Purchase to thy selfe posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
but let them be of
heauen, where neither rust
shall eate, nor hayle fall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
nor Sunne burne, nor
rayne corrupt thy fruites,
they being continuall and
euerlasting, free from the
touch of secular abuse &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>S. Hierome</hi> in his
Epistle to <hi>Demetriades</hi> sayth:
<hi>Consideremus &amp;c.</hi> Let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how wisely Wisdome
it self hath spoken: <hi>Sell what
thou hast.</hi> To whome is this
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:8953:97"/>
commanded? To wit, to
him to whome it is sayd:
If thou wilt be perfect, sell
not a part of thy goods, but
all. And when thou hast
sould them, what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?
Giue them to the poor,
not to the rich, not to thy
Neighbors who are weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
not to maintaine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
but to suffice necessity.
Whether he be a Priest, or
thy cozen, or kinsman, thou
shalt consider in him no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respect but his pouerty.
Let the bowels of those that
are hungry, not the fat ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets
of those that surfet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:8953:97"/>
thy almes &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Yet for all this it is
not the meaning of <hi>S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>
that if a Virgin entreth
not in to Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, she should
depriue her selfe, of that
which is needfull for her
selfe to liue on in good for;
but that she bestow therest
which she hath superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
for the vse of the poore,
&amp; that after the manner
which she iudgeth to be
most to the honour of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
goeth yet for ward, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to those who hauing
vowed Virginity, and are
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:8953:98"/>
very rich &amp; wealthy, thus:
But there be some rich wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
&amp; very wealthy, who
will set out, and shew their
store, &amp; say, that they must
vse their owne goods. Let
these first vnderstand, that
she is rich, who is rich in
God; that she is wealthy
who is wealthy in Christ;
that those be goods indeed,
which be spirituall, diuine,
and heauenly, which lead
vs to God, which with sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
possession remaine to
vs when we be with God.
But whatsoeuer things are
earthly, gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this world,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:8953:98"/>
and heere to remaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the world, they must be
contemned as well as the
world it self, whose pomps
and pleasures we doe then
renounce, when with a
better pace, we come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
and stir vs vp, conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
with his spirituall &amp;
heauenly voice: <hi>Do not,</hi> saith
he, <hi>loue the world nor those things
which are in the world. If any
man loue the world, the Charity
of the Father is not in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all that is in the world, is
the concupiscence of the flesh, and
the concupiscence of the eyes, and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:8953:99"/>
the ambition of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which
is not of the Father, but of the
concupiscence of the world. And
the world shall passe and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence
therof. But he that doth
the will of God abideth for euer,
euen as God abideth for euer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore eternal &amp;
diuine thinges are to be
sought after, and all things
are to be done according to
Gods will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that so we may
follow the footsteps of our
Lord, and his diuine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examples,
who did warne
vs and say: <hi>I descended not from
heauen to do myne owne will, but
the will of him that sent me.</hi>
                        <pb n="185" facs="tcp:8953:99"/>
Now if the seruant be not
greater then his Maister, &amp;
he that is made free oweth
duety to his deliuerer, we
that desire to be Christians,
must imitate that which
Christ did. It is written,
it is read, it is heard, and for
our example celebrated by
the Churches mouth. He
that sayth, he abideth in
Christ, ought euen as he
walked, himselfe also to
walke. We must therefore
walke with equal steps, we
must endeauour to follow
his paces. Then doth the
following of the Truth, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8953:100"/>
to the Faith of the
name, and reward is giuen
to him that belieueth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that which is belieued is
also done.</p>
                     <p>Thou sayst, that thou
art wealthy and rich: but
<hi>S. Paul</hi> doth obiect against
thy riches, and prescribe
with his wordes, that thy
trimming and decking is
to be moderated by an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
end. Let women
sayth he, with shamfastnes
and modesty adorne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
not in plaited hayre,
nor gold, nor pretious stons
nor gorgeous apparell, but
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8953:100"/>
as it beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth women pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
chastity by good
conuersation. <hi>S. Peter</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
doth consent with
these precepts and say: Let
there be in a woman, not
the outward decking of fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes,
or of gold, or of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
garmentes, but the trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of the hart. Now if
these men do admonish vs,
that euen those women,
who are wont to excusethe
adorning of themselues for
their husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds saks, are to be
restrained, and moderated
by religious obseruation,
according to Ecclesiasticall
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8953:101"/>
disciplin: how much more
expedient is it that a Virgin
should obserue the same?
Who deserueth no pardon
of this her trimming, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can she cast her fault,
vpon another, but she her
selfe must beare all the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</p>
                     <p>Thou dost say, that thou
art wealthy and rich: but
not all that may, ought also
to be done. Neither must
inordinate desires, and such
as spring vp out of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of the world, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
beyond the honesty
&amp; shamfastnes of a Virgin,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:8953:101"/>
for so much as it is writen:
All thinges are lawfull, but
all thinges are not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.
All things are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but all thinges do not
edify. But if thou adorne
thy selfe ouer sumptuously,
and go abroad, so as al men
may note thee, and draw
the eyes of young men to
regard thee, and make them
sigh after thee, and nourish
their vnlawfull appetite to
desire thee, and kindle their
fire to longe after thee, in
such sort, that albeit thou
perish not thy selfe, yet thou
art the ruine of others, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:8953:102"/>
shew thy selfe as a sword or
poyson to those that looke
on thee; thou canst not be
excused, as if thou wert
chast and honest in mind.
Thy wanton attyre, and
dishonest trimming doth
reprehend thee; neither
canst thou be numbred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Damsels &amp; Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
of Christ, who dost
liue so, as if thou wouldest
be loued.</p>
                     <p>Thou dost say that thou
art wealthy and rich; but
it beseemeth not a virgin
to vaunt of her riches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
holy scripture saith:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:8953:102"/>
what good hath our pride
donne vnto vs, or what
profit hath the vaunting
of riches brought vs? All
those things or past away
like a shadow. And againe
the Apostle doth admonish
vs and say: And they that
buy, let them be as though
they possessed not; and they
that vse this world, as
though they vsed it not: for
the figure of this world pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
a way. S <hi>Peter</hi> also vnto
whome our Lord c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his sheepe to feed, and
to defend them, and vpon
whome he set and founded
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:8953:103"/>
his Church, did denie that
he had either gold or siluer,
saying that he was rich in
the grace of Christ, and
wealthy in his faith and
power; by which he could
do strange and miraculous
things, and by which he
abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in spirituall goods
to attain the grace of glory.
These goods and riches she
can not possesse, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth
to be esteemed rich,
rather to the world than to
Christ. Thus far S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth is her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation,
wherein the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fathers prescribe to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:8953:103"/>
that they must auoyd
frequentation of marriages
publique banquettings, &amp;
the company and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of secular persons, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
of such are light in
their behauiour, and are
giuen vnto the world; and
that she should conuerse
with modest and deuout
women.</p>
                     <p>So saith <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> in the
place aboue cyted, <hi>Quosdam
non pudet nube<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tibus interesse &amp;c.</hi>
Some (quoth he) are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed
to be prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages,
and in that liberty of
lasciuious talke, to chatte
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8953:104"/>
with the rest, and mingle
now and then, impure &amp;
dishonest speaches; to heare
that which is not fitting to
be heard, nor lawfull to
speake againe; yea and to be
euen present at lasciuious
conferences, and drunken
banquets, by which the
fuell of Lust is kindled.
The Bride now accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to the patience of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vnchastnes, and the
Bridegrome to be the more
audacious, what place is it
then to be at Marriages, for
such a one whose minde is
neuer to be marryed? And
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:8953:104"/>
though she remaine both in
body &amp; mind a virgin, yet
by her eares, and eyes, she
hath lost part of that which
she had before.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>S. Hierome</hi> likewise in his
epist. to <hi>Demetriades<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> Decline
and auoyd (saith he) the
husbands of Matrons, such
as serue the world, for feare
least thy mind be troubled,
and thou heare either what
the husband sayth to the
wife, or the wife to the
husband, for such Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
are poyson vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Choose women that
are graue, and especially
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:8953:105"/>
Widdowes and Virgins to
be thy companions, whose
conuersation is approued to
be good, their speaches well
gouerned; &amp; their outward
modesty presages their san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
within. Auoyd the
wantonnes and immodesty
of yong Maydes, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
their heads stangely,
weare lockes at their eares,
make their skynne smooth
by art, paint, weare straite
bodies, and sleeues, must
not haue a wrinkle in their

shoes, and all this forsooth,
that vnder the name of a
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:8953:105"/>
Mayde, they may seeme the
more salable. For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
and inclination
of the Mistresse, is oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
iudged and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
by that of the wayting
woman, and such as they
keep company withal &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>S. Hierome</hi> goeth on thus:
And this likewise a Virgin
must take specially heed
of, that she neuer talke or
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerse at any tyme alone,
with any man, whether he
be secular or religious, no
not so much as with her
ghostly Father, withont
the company of others: but
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:8953:106"/>
let all things be done open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
where they may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
of others. Or if it be
necessary at any tyme to
talke with any man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
doors, let it not be done,
vnles some other be present
who may see al. For it is an
vnseemly thing for a man,
thogh be her Confessarius,
yea religious (&amp; though his
habit should make him
seeme to be euen of the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
of S. Iohn Baptist) to
be alone with a woman
in a chamber, the doore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
shut, and without any
other present; whether it be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:8953:106"/>
vnder pretense of Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or any spirituall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
whatsoeuer. Let her
remember that <hi>Thamar</hi> in
priuate, for want of presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of others, was rauished
by her owne brother. Let
her remember that for the
most part all that haue falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in this kind, haue done it
through the neglect of this
aduice.</p>
                     <p>If there were no confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in priuat, there would
hardly any dishonesty be
euer committed. Therfore
this especially is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
of a virgin, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:8953:107"/>
That she keep herselfe
vndefiled, both before God
and men</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> also in his 2. bo.
vpon S. <hi>Lukes</hi> ghospell saith:
<hi>Trepidare virginum est &amp;c.</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
ought to tremble and
feare, as often as any man
comes into their presence,
and be affrayde to speake
vnto any man &amp;c. he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
of such a one when she
is alone (for in priuate they
are fire and tow to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:)
and the diuell neuer
more imployeth all his
strength and endeauour,
then at such a tyme, for
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8953:107"/>
feare least so fit an occasion
should escape without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
vnto him. See more
concerning this matter in
<hi>S. Hierome</hi> in his 8. 9. 10. 11.
and 22. Epistle.</p>
                     <p>Of any vow of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to be made to ones
ghostly Father, I finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
written in holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
neither do I iudg it
expedient (vnlesse in some
few who are truly perfect,
&amp; are become euen maisters
as it were, in the way of
Perfection) by reason of
many discommodityes,
that may follow thereof.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8953:108"/>
Wherfore it is deseruedly
forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Rules of the
Society of Iesus, that any
such Vow should be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by any Father of that
Order. To which also may
be added the solemne decre
of the Prouinciall Councel
of <hi>Mechline</hi> which by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
I happened vpon lately,
wherein the 5. tytle the 7.
<hi>Chap.</hi> are these words. <hi>Nemo
aliquem ad perpetuò &amp;c.</hi> No

any one, neuer to confesse
his sinnes to any other then
to him &amp;c. And this Synod
declareth all such Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:8953:108"/>
or promise, though
confirmed by vow, to be
vnreasonable, indiscreet,
voyd, and of no effect; &amp;
therefore as far, as it shalbe
needfull, doth by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Decree ordeyne it to
be so. I omit also many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which may be
alleadged for this purpose.</p>
                     <p>These prescriptions of

                     <head>CHAP. VIII. VVhether single life, confirmed by
Vow, may be properly
called an Estate.</head>
                     <p>SOME seeme to make
doubt, Whether single
life co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed by vow, ought
properly to be called an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
nor do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know vpon
what grounds. Neuertheles
it may be easily gathered
out of that which hath byn
sayd before, that this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of liuing, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called an <hi>Estate,</hi> and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:8953:109"/>
that such as professe the sam
may be rightly sayd to haue
chosen, and to be of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.</p>
                     <p>For an <hi>Estate</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els, but a manner of
life, in the which it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
so to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue, that it
may not be lawfull to goe
out therof into another, as
<hi>S. Thom. 2. 2. quaest.</hi> 183. and
other Doctours, doe euery
where teach: but vowed
Chastity or Virginity is a
manner of life, wherein it
is firmely purposed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
so that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to forsake the same &amp;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:8953:110"/>
marry; therefore it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
an Estate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Henriques</hi> teacheth the
same in his 12. <hi>Quodlibet,</hi>
where he sayth, That the
estate of Virginity or wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood
is no lesse to be
accounted an Estate in the
Church of God, then the
Estate of Marriage. And
<hi>Caietan</hi> affirmeth, that this
doctrine of <hi>Henriques</hi> is true,
according to the Law, if
Virginity or Widdowhood
be kept, or professed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation
of vow.</p>
                     <p>And surely if there
be in the Church an Estate
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:8953:110"/>
of Marriage, why should
there not be also an Estate
of Virginity or widdow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?
If there be an Estate
of those which are wedded,
why should there not be
the like of those that liue
continent, especially when
S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> witnesseth; <hi>That
this is the more beautyfull part or
portion of Christ.</hi> If marriage
with a mortall man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which can continue
but a small tyme, setleth a
man in an Estate, why
should not also an eternall
marriage with Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which is neuer to haue
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:8953:111"/>
end, effect the same? Those
who at this prensent are in
the state of wedlocke, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
not longe therin, but
after a litle time by death of
the one party, must go out
of it, into the estate of such
as liue single: but such as
are now in the Estate of
thos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that liue continent,
shall neuer go out of it, but
alwayes remaine therein.
From whence it appeares
that this is rather, and more
perfectly to be tearmed an
Estate, then that of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth it auaile,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:8953:111"/>
that this vow of perpetuall
Virginity may be dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with all, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Estate seemeth not
to be firme &amp; immoueable.
First, because such a dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
may be only graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Pope himselfe,
yea is very seldome graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and that for matters of
great importance: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
such release is not of
force before Almighty God;
but that which is only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predended
vnder the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Pope may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
thought impossible to
vs, and therefore it dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:8953:112"/>
not the immobility
or remouall of this estate:
for it is sufficient, that by vs
as much as is on our parts,
it is firme and immoueable,
in so much that it cannot
be altered by vs; otherwise
Religion it selfe should not
be an Estate, since the Pope
may vpon iust occasions of
great importance, release a
Religious man from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation
of his Order, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
with his vowes, and
permit him to marry.</p>
                     <p>Secondly also, because
Marriage is an Estate, yet it
may be many wayes dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:8953:112"/>
to wit before carnall
knowledge of one another,
by entring into Religion;
and also after the knowledg
of one another by death of
the wife, or husband. Also
by the Adultery of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
the wife hath right
of a diuorce, whereby the
Marriage it selfe is dissolued
euen to euery duety &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iugall
act, as though it had
beene no marriage at all, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the habituall obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
remaine.</p>
                     <p>Finally if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
in the Estate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,
it may be dissolued,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:8953:113"/>
although it were consuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
by copulation, if so be
the one be conuerted to the
Catholike fayth, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perseuere in Infidelity.
Therefore Wedlocke is far
more easily, &amp; more wayes
dissolued, then the vow of
Virginity: and yet that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
not, but that it is, and
may be truely called an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state;
much lesse therefore
shal that power of releasing
it, which consisteth only in
the authority of the Prince
of spirituall matters, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the vow of Virginity of
being tearmedan Estate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="213" facs="tcp:8953:113"/>
Thirdly a Cleargy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
is made a true Estate
by meanes of the Vow of
Chastity, added to holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and hath sufficient fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menesse;
and yet the Pope
may easily take it away, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in a Deacon, and
giue him leaue to marry.
Therefore it followeth &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Seruitude is a
true Estate, according to al
lawes, and yet at the Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
pleasure, the seruant
may be enfranchised, and
made free: Therefore that
extrinsecal power of taking
away any obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:8953:114"/>
consisteth not in our owne
powers, doth by no meanes
impaire the assurednesse &amp;
certainty of an Estate. For
it is inough, that it is firme
and immutable on our part.
And the reason is, because
he is sufficiently sayd to be
in an Estate, who maketh
choice of a certaine kinde
of life, and settleth himself
firmely therein, so that he
cannot take any other v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
him differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnto this,
but must continue therein,
euen vnto death. But he
who imbraceth single life,
and byndeth himselfe by
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8953:114"/>
vow vnto it, chooseth to
himselfe a certaine kind of
life, &amp; so establisheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
therein, as he cannot
passe out of it, vnto the
contrary. Therefore he is
in an Estate.</p>
                     <p>You will aske perhaps,
Whether this Estate may
be called an Estate of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
I answere, that it is
not a complete Estate of
Perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but only in part,
because it is a notable part
of the Estate of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for
some Estates include more,
&amp; others lesse. An Estate of
Perfection which is entire
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8953:115"/>
and complete, includeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the vow of Pouerty and
Obedience, both which
a Virgin vowing Chastity
in the world, may also after
her manner, imitate and
supply before God.</p>

                     <p>And for as much as
all perfection of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
in abandoning and
forsaking carnal and worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly
things, &amp; drawing neer
and ioyning himselfe vnto
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8953:120"/>
God his Creatour, louing
him, fearing him, seeking
him, thinking on him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
and honouring
him in euery thing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
this can hardly be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
in the state of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
especially by wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
who hunting after, &amp; day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
following the delightes
and pleasures of the world,
are hindred thereby, for the
most part, from treading the
true path which leadeth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
thereunto. But Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
who are free from
such cares and troubles, and
haue a true desire, may with
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:8953:121"/>
great case and facility per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the same to their
great comfort.</p>
                     <p>Now, there be diuers
sorts of Widdowes. Some,
as soone as their husbands
be dead, purpose so marry
againe, for some temporall
comfort and consolation,
not hauing any diuine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
to serue God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
in that Estate, and
are in danger to offend him.
Of this sort of widdowes
<hi>S. Paul</hi> speaketh, when he
saith. <hi>I will, that the yong wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
do marry againe, &amp; become
mothers of families, not to giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8953:121"/>
to the Diuell to tempt them.</hi>
And this is not ill but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
of all. But when
a widdow will marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
for any disordinate
appetit, or because she is
very rich, or faire, or soght
after by some one that is
placed in a high degree of
Honour or State, or for any
other vicious occasion, or ill
end, without doubt this her
desire is naught, nor is she
to be reckoned, or worthily
called a widdow, as long
as she remaynes with this
desyre, although she do not
actually marry againe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="230" facs="tcp:8953:122"/>
There is another sort of
widdowes, who though
they do not purpose to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
againe at all, eyther for
that they haue no dowry,
or for feare least they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
vpon an ill husband, or
for some other secret or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
respect, yet is their
manner of life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
not like indeed vnto
widdowes: for that they
will allwayes be gadding
abroad, tatling, &amp; gossip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
euen with those who
be not reputed of the best
edification. And these,
forsooth, will be finely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled:
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:8953:122"/>
and though they
haue veyles, yet will they
scarsely couer their heades
with them; their eyes must
be rolling vp and downe,
they must go to banquets
weddings and playes, they
must tell tales, heare &amp; tell
newes, &amp; carry themselues
euen as meere secular, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
and the worst sort of
people. These are to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and shunned by all true
widdowes: and these be
those of whome <hi>S. Paul</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in another place, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>Take heed of such yonge
widdowes, for after that they haue
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:8953:123"/>
liued riotously, and licentiously in
Christ, they will marry, carrying
with them their damnation, for
that they haue broken and made
voyd their first faith. &amp;c.</hi> And
for these it were better that
they did marry againe, then
liue as they do.</p>
                     <p>Another sort there is,
who neuer intend, nor do
indeed marry againe, but
liue chastely &amp; vertuously,
both in act and desyre. But
yet they do it not for the
loue of God, but rather for
some humaine respect, as
for the loue of their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
their goods, or the like. And
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:8953:123"/>
although according to the
esteeme of the world, they
liue honestly, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
for Venerable Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and Matrones; yet
are they wholy dedicated to
the seruice of the world, &amp;
haue little feeling or gust
of spirituall things; and do
but seldome frequent the
Sacraments or sermons, fast
only but when the church
commandeth them, or doe
imploy themselues in any
other spirituall Exercises.
These I do intreat, by the
bowels of Christ Iesus, that
they will no longer imploy
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:8953:124"/>
the gifts and graces which
they haue receaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our
Lord, to the honour and
seruice of the world, to the
end they may haue their
reward in heauen, and not
on earth.</p>
                     <p>There is another sort of
widdowes also, who make
a firme purpose and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
to conserue and
keep their chastity &amp; serue
God with all their hart: &amp;
of these there are two kinds.
One who cannot separate
themselues from their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or other parents, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the charge they
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:8953:124"/>
haue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or because they
cannot so wel liue alone, or
for some necessity, or chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in gouerning their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
and these although they
be not wholy free from the
world, nor are dedicated to
the seruice of God; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
al the paynes
and labours they take, they
doe it principally for the
loue of God, of whom they
shalbe rewarded with life
euerlasting. These Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
are not any to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued,
or drawne away
from this kind of life, but
are, according to S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <pb n="236" facs="tcp:8953:125"/>
greatly to be honoured and
esteemed.</p>
                     <p>The other kind, are
those Widdowes, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
to serue God, &amp; may
commodiously separat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from their parents,
friends, or family, and be
more free to attend to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and other deuout exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
yet they will not, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
a kind of pufill ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
or little courage, or
els for compassion to their
friendes, or for some other
reason. Neither are these
to be condemned, but estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in a second, or third
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:8953:125"/>
degree from the former.</p>
                     <p>The last sort of widdow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
are the true, &amp; worthily
so called, Widdowes, who
dispatching themselues of
al worldly impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, do
attend only to the seruice
of God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templating him,
and meditating on him day
and night. And these are
placed in a more quiet and
peaceable Estate, then any
of the others aboue named,
and are entred into the
right, and direct way of
perfection.</p>
                     <p>In this Estate liued that
Holy Widdowe <hi>Anne</hi> the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:8953:126"/>
Prophetesse, recorded by
S. <hi>Luke;</hi> who is sayd to
haue serued God in fasting
&amp; prayer, remaining night
and day in the Temple. And
if such Widdowes, who
haue a desire to liue vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not match or come
neere to <hi>S. Anne;</hi> yet let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
come as neere vnto her as
they can.</p>
                     <p>So as I conclude, that the
true Widdow, is she, who
not only conserues her
Chastity in the world, but
also whatsoeuer she doth,
she doth it purely for the
honour and seruice of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:8953:126"/>
God. And for that
euery widdow doth not
know how to exercise her
selfe in the truly seruing of
God, vnlesse she know the
scope and end therof, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
heere to set downe
briefly in what manner she
is to do the same.</p>

                     <p>VVHEN a Widdow
hath well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of her Estate &amp; firme
purpose to serue God, it is
necessary, that first she vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:8953:127"/>
what is the end &amp;
scope of this kind of life,
that conformably therto,
she may addresse all her
workes and actions.</p>
                     <p>The first and principal
end then is, that not onely
Widdowes but euery Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
also ought to liue wel
and in the feare of God,
whome she must loue more
then her owne soule: and
therefore she must labour,
that by al her endeauours &amp;
actions the name of God
may be euer blessed &amp; prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
Christian fayth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
aduanced, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8953:127"/>
This belongeth
more to Widdowes then to
many others, who conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
must be mortifyed,
and of a chast and pure life.
For that they hauing lost
their carnall Spouses, they
ought to seeke for no other
but their Spouse Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.
So as a truely deuout
Widdow ought so to infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
her hart with the zeale
of Gods honour, that she
should choose rather to dye,
then that by her means, her
Spouse should be any way
dishonoured.</p>
                     <p>Secondly she ought with
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:8953:128"/>
as great zeale seek and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
her owne saluation,
considering that she is not
alwayes to remayne in this
world, because it is orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for al men once to dye,
and then of necessity, to go
either to heaue, or to intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
torments in Hell,
or Purgatory. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hauing as it were, lost
and forgone all the Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of this transitory
world, she must force her
self, to get &amp; conserue those
that be celestiall, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting.</p>

                     <p>SAINT <hi>Paul</hi> wryting to
<hi>Timothy</hi> sayth: <hi>Honour
VViddowes.</hi> He meaneth such
Widdowes who liue vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
according to the rule
of Widdow-hood, that is
to say, to gouerne wel their
families, not only their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or their kinsfolkes,
but also their subiects, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing
them in good life,
manners and vertue, and
when it is needfull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and correct them.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:8953:129"/>
Secondly he sayth, That
Widdowes ought to hope
in God, to trust in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
in him alone to seeke
for Comfort and consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
hauing dayly their
mind eleuated in God in al
humility, praying often,
and imploring his diuine
ayde to preserue them from
all euill, to forgiue them,
(and all sinners) their sins,
to replenish them with his
gifts and graces, and lastly
to guide them to eternall
felicity.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly he sayth, That
a VViddow entertayning
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:8953:129"/>
worldly &amp; carnall consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
&amp; passing her dayes
in mirth, ioylity, &amp; vanity
is accompted for dead. For
although she liue according
to the body, yet is she dead
according to the spirit; nor
can she once do any good or
meritorious work, worthy
of heauen.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
widdowes, That they
should be irreprehensible in
all their words and deeds;
that is to say, that in all
their actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they giue good
example, &amp; that they keep
themselues, not only from
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:8953:130"/>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting of mortal crims,
but euen from the least ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall
sinnes that may be.
Whence it followes, that
if they liue vertuously, hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
in feare and vigilancy,

he hath exalted the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
many, if not aboue all

with an Epistle of his to

You desire in your letter,
and humbly intreate me,
that I will answere you,
or rather write vnto you
in what manner you may
liue, &amp; conserue the crowne
of widdowhood, without
any blemish of the honour
of your good Name. My
mind reioiceth, my bowells
do daunce, my affection
doth leape, because you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be such after your
husbands death, as your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Titiana</hi> of holy memory
was a long time her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
liuing. Her praiers and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions
are heard. She hath
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:8953:131"/>
obtained in her only daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that which she possessed
whilest she liued.</p>
                     <p>You haue moreouer a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great Priuiledge of your
Ancestours, that euen from
<hi>Camillus,</hi> either none at all,
or very few women of your
stocke was married the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time: so that you are
not so much to be praised,
if you remain a widdow; as
to be detested, if being a
Christian, you perfourme
not that, which heathen
women for so many ages
haue obserued. I say nothing
of <hi>Paula</hi> &amp; <hi>Eustochiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> flowers
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:8953:132"/>
of your family, least I may
seeme to take occasion by
the exhorting of you, to
praise them. I let passe <hi>Blesilla</hi>
which following her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
your brother, in a short
space of life, fulfilled many
yeares of vertue.</p>
                     <p>And I would to God
that men would imitate the
praises of women, &amp; wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckled
ould age would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
that which volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
youth doth offer. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
&amp; willingly I thrust
my hand into the fire. Many
countenances wil frowne,
many armes will be spread
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:8953:132"/>
abroad, and angry <hi>Chremes</hi>
will rage with his foa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
mouth. Many great
personages will be incensed
against my Epistles: the
whole company of Nobles
will thunder out, and say
I am a witch, that I am a
seducer, worthy to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
from all ciuill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealthes. Let them
adde, if they will, a Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane
also, that I may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
my Lords title.</p>
                     <p>Surely, I do not deuide
the daughter from her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Neither do I say that
of the gospell, Suffer the

to bury the dead. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
beleeueth in Christ
liueth, and whosoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leueth

to walke, euen as he wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
Honour your father,
but so, as he seuere you not
from your true father. So
long acknowledg the linck
of your bloud, how long he
acknowledgeth his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.
For otherwise Dauid
will presently sing vnto
you: Heare O daughter, &amp;
see, and incline thine eare,
and forget thy people, and
the house of thy father: and
the King will desire thy
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:8953:133"/>
beauty, because he is thy
Lord, thy God, and thy
King.</p>
                     <p>O great reward of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
ones Father! The
King wil desire thy beauty:
because thou hast heard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hast seene, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hast inclined thy
eare, &amp; forgot thy people
and the house of thy father;
therfore will the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
thy beauty, and will say
vnto thee: Thou are al faire,
O my Deare, and there is
no spotte in thee. What
thing more faire then the
soule, which is called the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:8953:134"/>
daughter of God, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no forraine orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts?
she beleeueth in Christ, and
with this ambition she
goeth to her spouse, hauing
the same to her Lord, and
to her spouse.</p>
                     <p>What miseries mariage
haue, you haue learned in
marriage it selfe: and you
haue bene filled with that
which you longed for, euen
vnto loathsomenes. Your
lawes haue tryed most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
choler, you haue cast out
those sower &amp; vnwholsom
meates, you haue eased your
boyling stomake. Why wil
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:8953:134"/>
you yet throwe in againe
that which once was hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vnto you? The dogge
returneth to his vomit, and
the sow againe to her wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
in the mire. The
very brute beastes, &amp; restles
birdes, do not fall the seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

                     <p>Do you feare least the

and least your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue not a babe by
you, which may creepe in
his bosome, and beslauer his
necke? What, I pray you?
haue all which are maried,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:8953:135"/>
children? And those chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
which they haue, do
they alwaies answere to
their kinred? Yea surely <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceroes</hi>
sonne did resemble
his fathers eloquence: and
<hi>Cornelia</hi> your Auncestresse,
an example of honesty and
fecundity, had much ioy of
the <hi>Gracchi</hi> her sonnes. It is
ridiculous to hope of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
for that, which both
many haue not had, &amp; haue
lost when once they had it.</p>
                     <p>To whom wil you leaue
so great riches? To Christ
who cannot dye. Who shall
be your heire? he which is
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8953:135"/>
also my Lord. Your father
will mourne, but Christ
will reioyce; your family
will be sorowfull, but the
Angels will be ioyfull. Let
your father do what he wil
with his substance: you are
not his, by whom you were
borne, but his by whom
you were borne againe, and
who redeemed you with an
exceeding great price, euen
with his bloud.</p>
                     <p>So far, ould good S.
<hi>Hierom.</hi> Where you see what
esteeme he maketh of Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood,
yea in a young,
noble, and beautifull Lady.

And no lesse doth he in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Epistle of his to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cella,</hi>
commending the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and resolution of <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silla</hi>
a young &amp; Noble wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

writeth to <hi>Marcella</hi> of <hi>Blesil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>
her sicknes.</p>
                     <p>Abraham is tempted in
his sonne, &amp; is found more
faithfull. Ioseph is sould
into Aegipt, that so he may
feed his father &amp; brethren.
Ezechias is terrified with
his death at hand, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
into teares, hath his
life prolonged for fifteene
yeares. Peter the Apostle is
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8953:136"/>
afflicted, with our Lords
passion, and weeping bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly,
he heareth; Feed my
sheepe. Paul a rauening
woolf, and another young
Beniamin is stroken blind
in a traunce, that he may
receiue his sight: and being
compassed with a suddaine
horrour of darknes, calleth
him Lord, whom before he
persecuted as man.</p>
                     <p>Euen so now, O <hi>Marcella,</hi>
we haue seene our louing
<hi>Blesilla</hi> thirty daies continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to haue bene tormented
with the burning of an
ague, that she might learne
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:8953:137"/>
to reiect the delights of that
body which shortly after is
to be consumed with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes.
To her also came our
Lord Iesus, and touched
her hand, and behould she
arising, now serueth him.
She sauoured somewhat of
negligence: and being tied
with the bandes of riches,
she lay in the sepulcher of
the world. But Iesus gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and being troubled in
spirit, cried out: <hi>Blesilla,</hi> come
forth. Who arose when she
was called, and being come
forth, now sitteh at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with our Lord.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="261" facs="tcp:8953:137"/>
Let the Iewes threaten
and swell, let them seeke
to murder her who hath
bene raised vp againe; and
let the o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly apostles reioyce.
She knoweth, that she
oweth her life vnto him,
who did restore it. She
knoweth that she e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braceth
his feete, whose iudgment
lately she feared. Her body
lay almost dead: and death
approaching did shake her
gasping members. Where
were then the helpes of her
kinred? where were then
the wordes full of vanity?
She oweth nothing vnto
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:8953:138"/>
thee O vngratefull kinred,
which dying to the world
is reuiued vnto Christ.
Who is a Christian, let him
reioyce: he that is angry,
sheweth that he is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
                     <p>A widdow loosed from
the bond of marriage, nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
nothing but perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
But doth the course
garment offend any person?
let Iohn offend him, then
whom, amongst the sonnes
of women there was none
greater: who being called
an Angell, baptized our
Lord himselfe, for he also
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:8953:138"/>
was cladd with a Camells
skynne, and girded with a
girdle of hayre. Do grosse
meates displease them? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more grosse then
locusts. Let those women
rather offend Christian eies
who with vernish and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
paint their eies, and
cheekes: whose plaistered
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance deformed with
ouermuch shining, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
Idols. Who if they
happen for want of heed to
let fall a teare, it trickleth
downe in a furrow: whom
not so much as the very
number of their yeares can
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:8953:139"/>
perswade that they are old:
who with other folkes hair
set forth their head: and
paint out in aged wrinckles
their youth forespent: who
finally in presence of many
nephews are trimmed like
trembling girles.</p>
                     <p>Let the Christian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
blush, if shee force the
comelinesse of nature, if
she make prouision for the
flesh vnto concupiscence, in
which according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
whosoeuer are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghted,
cannot please God.
Our widow before was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
carefully dressed: and all
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:8953:139"/>
the day at the glasse she stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
what might be amisse.
Now she confidently saith:
but we beholding the glory
of our lord with face reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
are transformed into
the same image, from glory
vnto glory, as of our Lords
spirit. Then the maides did
platte her hayre, and the
harmeles head was wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with frizeled tops: but
now the vntrimmed head
knoweth this to suffice, that
it is couered.</p>
                     <p>Then did the very soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of feathers seeme hard,
and she could scarce lay in
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:8953:140"/>
the raysed bedds: now she
riseth betimes for to pray,
and with her shrill voice
preuenting the others, in
singing <hi>Alleluia,</hi> she is the first
which beginneth to prayse
her Lord. She kneeleth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the bare ground, and
with often teares that face
is purged, which before
was defiled with painting.
After prayer, there are sung
psalmes: &amp; the feeble neck,
and wearyed knees, &amp; slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
eyes, for the earnest fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of the mind, can scant
obtain any rest. The mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
gowne is least fouled,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:8953:140"/>
when she lyeth on the
ground. The course pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toffle
affoardeth the price
of gilt shoes vnto the poore:
the girdle is not beset with
gold &amp; pretious stones, but
of wollen, and most pure,
because of the simplicity,
&amp; such as may rather strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the garments, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne
them.</p>
                     <p>If the Scorpion enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
so good a purpose, and
with flattering speach per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
againe to eate of the
forbidden tree; insteed of
a shoe, let him be crushed
with a curse; &amp; whilest he
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:8953:141"/>
dyeth in his poyson let him
haue this answere: Go after
me Satan: which is as much
to say, as Aduersary; for he
is the Aduersary of Christ,
and an Antichrist, whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
is displeased with the
precepts of Christ.</p>
                     <p>I pray you, what haue
we done like vnto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
that they are so offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
They forsake their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Father with their ship
and nets: the Publican ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
from the custom-house
&amp; followeth our Sauiour:
The disciple which desired
to returne home, and bidd
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:8953:141"/>
friends farewell, is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by our Maisters voice.
The buriall of a Father is
not allowed, &amp; it is a kind
of piety, for our Lord to be
voyd of pitty. We, because
we goe not in silkes, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
Monks, because we
are not drunke, neither o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
our mouthes vnto dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
laughter, we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
graue and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
If our coate be not gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous,
we straight heare
that common Prouerbe: He
is an hypocrite, and decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
Grecian.</p>
                     <p>Let them vse euen yet
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:8953:142"/>
more rude scoffes; and carry
about with them men stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed

<hi>Blesilla</hi> will laugh, and not
disdaine to hear the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of croking frogges,
whereas her Lord &amp; Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
was called <hi>Beelzebub.</hi>

                     <p>Hitherto S. <hi>Hierome.</hi>
And there might be heer set

briefest manner we can, not

                     <p>As those Widdowes
(sayth S. <hi>Hierome)</hi> who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>As Widdowes whilest
they were ioyned to the

being ioyned to god, banish
from their hartes all vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes.</p>
                     <p>As Widdowes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
they were marryed in

nourish and pamper their

children, &amp; supporting the
burden of Marriage: so now
let them keep sobriety, and
bring their body into ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude,
and subiect the same

Let a Widdow be so

                     <p>Let her neuer be alone,

she is seen to conuerse with

especially of Widdows that

come neere vnto her.</p>
                     <p>Let her take great heed

by her vertuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment.</p>
                     <p>She must also haue a
great care of her honesty
and reputation, of which
she ought to be alwayes so
iealous, and fearefull, that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:8953:145"/>
her speach, her face, and
all the actions of her body,
yea her very garments may
demonstrate the same; to
the end that no occasion be

as to thinke the contrary of
her.</p>
                     <p>By how much more
younge she is; by so much
the more ought she to be
graue, and venerable in all
her actions.</p>
                     <p>Let her not take too
much pleasure, or delight in

                     <p>Let her alwayes haue at

                     <p>And for that, the flesh

naturall oftentymes to a

                     <p>Let her alwayes haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

God gaue to one of them so

of <hi>Holofernes;</hi> and to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to be the first widdow
who should imbrace, and
receaue the Sauiour of the

thereby made partaker of
diuers diuine secrets.</p>
                     <p>Let her consider that her
soule, is the daughter of
God, &amp; therfore she ought
not to vse any strang or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical

her body; but let all her
study and care be to adorne
her soule, as it becommeth
the daughter of God,</p>
                     <p>She must not content
her selfe to haue begon any
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:8953:147"/>
thing well, but she must
study how to end it well:
although <hi>S. Paul</hi> began to do
euill, and ended with good;
and <hi>Iudas</hi> contrariwise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to do well, but ended in
euill.</p>
                     <p>To what purpose should
there be colours &amp; vernice

Christian? Such an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the body becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
not one, that serueth
Christ, but rather one who
serueth Antichrist. And if
any looke towardes heauen

not know them, since they

haue changed that shape

                     <p>Why do we promise

And let her also think

This Humility must not

For we are all borne of the

couetousnes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice,
the holy Scripture

When a widdow hath

let her twist it, let her see

can be so pretious in the

                     <p>Let a VViddow take
heed of adorning or atty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her head with pearles,
Iewells, or pretious carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,

                     <p>The same did <hi>Chunegun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi>
wife to <hi>Henry</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
who perswaded him

                     <p>Neither must we passe
ouer in silence the most
worthy and noble example
of <hi>Galla</hi> daughter to <hi>Simma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
a Consul of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose
husband deceasing, and she
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:8953:166"/>
left a yong and beautifull
widdow, was so assayled
with infirmityes, that her
body became ful of botches
and soares. She consulted
with her Doctours, who
all agreed, that if she would
be cured, she must marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Whose counsell she
so much disliked, that she
sayd, She would rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the same all the dayes
of her life, yea death it self,
then marry againe: which
purpose she truly obserued
most Saintly in holy Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood
to her dying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>

                        <hi>Ania</hi> also another Roman
Lady, and widdow of great
worth and nobility, yong,
&amp; fayre, her husband being
dead, which he had enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but a small while, was
earnestly sollicited by her
friends to a second marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge,
which she vterly refused.
Being by them demaunded
the cause why, she said. If
(quoth she) I should marry
again, &amp; find a good huba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
like to my former, I should
liue continually in feare to
loose him by death: and
least I should cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to light
vpon a bad husband, I will
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:8953:167"/>
not aduenture vpon such
a disgrace. An act and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
surely wise, and graue,
worthy to be considered
attentiuely by widdowes,
that desyre to liue out of
danger.</p>
                     <p>As nobly and prudently
did <hi>Olimpia</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
disciple of <hi>S. Iohn Chrysostome,</hi>
and the widdow of <hi>Nebridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
Prefect of the Army, a
man of most noble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne,
who hauing byn
married but twenty mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
only, was exhorted
by <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour
to marry againe, since she
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:8953:167"/>
was both yong, fayre, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
rich, learned, and held
of euer one for a virgin. She
made this Answere. If my
Lord the Emperour (quoth
she) would haue me to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
againe, why did he so
soone depriue me of my
husband (for he was slayne
in the Emperours warres)
who was so agreable to my
nature, and myne to his?
But because his Highnesse
knows me to be vnfit for a
marryed Estate, it seemes he
hath quickly deliuered me
from that seruitude: and
made me print in my hart
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:8953:168"/>
the delight of Continency
in widdowhood.</p>
                     <p>And let no man meruaile
that the continency of wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood
is so much reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to Christian wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
seing that among the
Gentills, specially the old
<hi>Romans,</hi> the same was so gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
honoured, that when a
widdow died, her head was
adorned with a Crowne of
Continency, and to caryed
in solemne triumph to her
graue.</p>
                     <p>The said Romans did
also attribute another ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to the Continency of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:8953:168"/>
Widdowhood, which was,
That on the wedding day,
there were no women suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to come neere, much
lesse to touch the Bride, but
only such as had beene the
wiues of one husband, to
wit, such as had beene but
once marryed; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding
all that had beene twice
marryed (yea though they
were Widdowes) to keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loofe
of, as prophane, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure,
and fortelling of an
euill fortune to the happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of marriage.</p>
                     <p>They did moreouer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt
it a signe of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:8953:169"/>
in any woman,
to marry more then once.
And for this cause one <hi>Portia</hi>
a Noble Lady being in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

that one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

sayd vnto her: <hi>Madame, The
happy, and chast woman neuer
marryes but once.</hi> A saying
worthy of a most prudent
and wise Lady. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
to this was that most
laudable fact of <hi>Cornelia,</hi>
daughter to <hi>Africanus</hi> &amp; wife
to <hi>Tyberius Gracchus,</hi> who

refused a second Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage

accompting it an act of too

you, haue we had in our

set aside all pompe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

in our Iland (and the

parts of <hi>Germany</hi> vntill this
day) that in tyme of warre,
plagues, famyne, or of any
publicke necessity, there
were in many Citties and
Townes a certaine number
of widdowes ordayned to
watch &amp; pray continually,
night and day, in the
Churches, by their turnes
or courses, one or more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather:
because it was held,
that their prayers were of
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:8953:175"/>
more efficacy, and power
with Almighty God, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swage
his wrath, then the
prayers of other common
people, as persons dedicated
wholy to his seruice, by the
obseruation of Continency,
in their Chaste, and Holy
widdowhood.</p>
                     <p>Neyther is the true Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and Constancy of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout
Widdowes, in our
Countrey; lesse to be praised
and admired; since in that
kind also we haue gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
many other Nations,
especialy in these later days,
when as their noble and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:8953:176"/>
heriocall Examples heerof
haue made them famous to
posterity; whether we res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
their courage &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy
in suffering both losse
of goods &amp; imprisonment
for their faith and religion,
as glorious Confessours; or
els the sheeding of their
bloud in testimony of the
same, as triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phant Martyrs.</p>
                     <p>For vpon some of these
widdowes hath God besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
an inuincible coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
and fortitude, ioyned
with an admirable patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in suffering for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:8953:176"/>
of their bodyes,

fortunes, to their wholy
vndoing in their temporall
estates in this world, that
they might receaue a more
plentifull reward and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

And what Catholike in

                     <p>Vpon others, hath sweet

and superabundant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
bestowed a more high

losse of goods &amp; liberty
in this life; but also to seale
