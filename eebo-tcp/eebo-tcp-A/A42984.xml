         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <p>Take quick good midling Ale, and put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a ſufficient quantity of the beſt Wormwood, let it ſtand over night, the next morning take three or four Cloves of Garlick, peel them, and then prick them with a Needle in three or four places, then ſwallow them whole if you can; if not, you may cut them leſs: then drink a good draught of the Wormwood-Ale after it; and then do upon it as much Exerciſe as conveniently you can; at Dinner eat what you will of good wholſom Diet, but at night ſup not, or but very little; and at going to bed take the Cloves of Garlick again, and drink a good draught of the Wormwood-Ale after it, a in the Morning. Continue this till you are well, which uſually is in twenty or thirty days; But during the Cure, you muſt every morning and night uſe the following Bath or Fomentation: Take three Gallons of Conduit-water, and boil in it five or ſix handfuls of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and two pound of freſh Mutton-Suet (that which is next the Kidneys) skinned and ſhred ſmall, and half a peck of Wheat bran; boyl it till the Fat be throughly melted, and the Vertue of the Mallows drawn out into the Liquor; then ſtrain it into a Tub or a large wooden Bowl, and bath your feet and legs therein for half an hour or an hour, fomenting the legs with the Herbs as hot as you can endure

it. This will draw much water from the legs; for after you have taken the Garlick and Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood-Ale awhile, it will drive the humors into the legs and feet, which will be much ſwelled with it, and pit much; but the Bath will draw all the Humors and Water out of them.

                        <p>You may alſo uſe the following dry Bath: Take yellow Amber the worth of three pence, or four pence; pulverize it, and mix it with a quart of good Wine-Vinegar, then take a Brick and make it hot, but not red hot; put it into a Tub, putting ſome Aſhes under it; then powr upon the Brick the mixture of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and Amber, and hold the ſwell'd legs over the ſmoak of it, covering the Tub well with Sheets or Blankets, that none of the Smoak may come out, and immediatly the Water will come out of the Legs, and they will be cured, whether they be ſwoln with the Dropſie, or with any other bad Humour.</p>

                        <head>Certain Signs, whereby Women may know when they have Conceived.</head>
                        <p>AUthors have left many Ways for Women to know whether they be with Child or not, which proves true indeed in many Women, but not in all; Some of them I ſhall relate here.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A Coldneſs and Chillineſs of the outward parts after Conception; for the Heat retires in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to make the Conception.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The Belly groweth very flat firſt of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Womb cloſeth it ſelf together, to nouriſh and cheriſh the Seed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Breaſts begin to ſwell and grow hard, not without Pain and Soreneſs.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="298" facs="tcp:41614:161"/>4. The Tops of the Nipples look redder than formerly.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Wringing or griping pains like Cramps, happen in the Belly about the Navil.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Loſs of Appetice to Meat, and illneſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Meat, and weakneſs of the Stomack.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. The Veins of the Breaſts are more clearly ſeen than they were wont to be.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. It is a good Sign when the Veins in the Eyes are clearly ſeen, and the Eyes ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſcoloured.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Divers Longings and Appetites are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. If under the lower Eye-lid the Vein be ſwelled, and the Veins in the Eyes appear clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Eye ſomething diſcoloured, if the Woman have not her Terms at that time, nor watched the Night before, you may certainly conclude her to be with Child; and this appears moſt plainly juſt upon her Conception, and the firſt two Months. This Mr. <hi>Culpepper</hi> ſays he hath known to be true, and never to fail.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Put the Urine of the Woman in a Glaſs, and ſtop it, and let it ſtand three days, and then ſtrain it through a fine Linnen Cloth, if you find ſmall living Creatures in it, ſhe is moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly conceived with Child.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Take a green Nettle top, and put it into her Urin, and ſtop it cloſe, and let it ſtand all Night, the next Morning take it out, and if it is, full of red Spots, ſhe is with Child; if not, the Nettle will be blackiſh.</p>

                        <p n="3">3. The Child is firſt felt on the right ſide, becauſe (according to <hi>Hypocrates)</hi> the Male-Children lie on the right ſide of the Womb.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <pb n="300" facs="tcp:41614:162"/>4. The Woman breeds Boys eaſier and with leſs Trouble and Pain than Girls, and carries her Burthen not ſo heavily, but is more nimble in moving.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The right Breaſt is more plump and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the left, and the right Nipple red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. The Womans Complexion is more clear, and not ſo dull and ſwarthy as when ſhe beareth a Girl.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Let a drop of her Milk fall into a Baſon of fair Water, if it ſinks to the Bottom, ſhe bears a Girl; but if it ſwims and ſpreads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, it is a Boy.</p>

                        <head>Of the Cauſes of Miſcarriage.</head>
                        <p>The ordinary Cauſes of Abortion are the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. A weakneſs or foulneſs of the Womb; when it is weakned or offended by viſcous, ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or ſlippery, phlegmatick or watery Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, ſo that it cannot retain the Fruit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Being extreamly bound in Body, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to ſtool, forces the Child down. <hi>Hypocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> ſays the Diſeaſe <hi>Teneſmus</hi> coming upon a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with Child, cauſes Abortion. <hi>Teneſmus</hi> is a Diſeaſe when people have a great provocation to ſtool, yet can do nothing.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The Emroids or Piles many times cauſe Miſcarriage; for which I have given you ſeveral excellent and approved Remedies: which ſee in their places.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Hunger ſtarves the Child in the Womb, and Surfeiting by much eating and drinking, ſtrangles it. Fat women are ſubject to miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry becauſe of the ſlipperineſs of their wombs. Forbear ſtrong Purges or Vomits; but if you are ſubject to be coſtive, uſe gentle means to keep the Body open.</p>
                        <p>Abortion alſo is cauſed either by Blows, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Sorrow and Grief, Running, Leapings, Liftings, immoderate Exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſureſt way is to prevent Miſcarriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Child is conceived, by cleanſing and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:41614:165"/>
ſtrengthening the womb by ſuch Medecines as procure and forward Conception afterwards; And to thoſe which I have given you before for that intention, I will add theſe following.</p>
                        <p>Drink Wine wherein the Mother of Thyme hath been boiled, which is excellent for that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                        <p>The Seeds of Mandrake are ſaid to cleanſe and purge a foul womb, cool a hot womb, and moiſten a dry womb; you may take half a dram of them bruiſed in a little white Wine.</p>
                        <p>To Women with Child to prevent Miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, <hi>Culpepper</hi> recommends to drink a Draught of Sage Ale every Morning; he ſays it will do her more good than ſhe is aware of; if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know more of it, you may read his Book. He alſo recommends Tanſie-Ale, as you make Sage-Ale (a Draught being drunk in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) to be a Sovereign Remedy for ſuch Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as are ſubject to miſcarry; he doth not teach how to make it; but it is done by ſtamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sage or Tanſie, and putting it in a Bag of looſe Bolter-cloth, and hang it in a Rundlet of Ale.</p>
                        <p>He adviſes alſo Midwives to keep a Syrup by them made with the Juice of Garden-Tanſie clarified, and boiled to a Syrup with double weight of Sugar, and to give a ſpoonful of it whenſoever any Signs of Abortion appear; as alſo to ſtamp Garden-Tanſie, and ſprinkle it with Muskadel, and apply it to the Navil. It is a moſt excellent Remedy.</p>

                     <p>I Cannot forbear but I muſt make ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion here, to unfold ſome other Effects of Nature, which we ſee often, and are not leſs curious than the moſt principal which we treat of, and will ſeem to be derived from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Cauſes, notwithſtanding in many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances they depend on the ſame Principles, and in many much differing; it is touching Moles and Marks which happen to Infants, when their
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:41614:166"/>
Mothers, during the time of their Pregnancy, have longed after ſome particular things.</p>
                     <p>To proceed after my accuſtomed manner, I will fall to exemplifie.</p>
                     <p>A Lady of great Quality, which many of this Aſſembly know, at leaſt by Reputation, hath upon her Neck the Figure of a Mulberry, as exactly as any Painter or Carver can poſſibly repreſent one; for it bears not only the Colour, but the fit proportion of a Mulberry, and is as it were, emboſſed in her Fleſh. The Mother of this Lady being with Child, ſhe had a great mind to eat Mulberries, and her Imagination being ſatisfied (ſhe being under the Tree) one of them caſually fell upon her Neck, the ſanguine Juice whereof was ſoon wiped off, and ſhe felt nothing at that time: The Child being born, the perfect Figure of a Mulberry was ſeen upon her Neck, in the ſame place where it fell upon the Mothers; and every year in Mulberry Seaſon, this Impreſſion, or rather Excreſcence of Fleſh did ſwell, grow big, and itch.</p>
                     <p>Another Maid which had the like Mark of a Strawberry, was more incommodated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; for it not only inflamed and itched in Strawberry Seaſon, but it broke like an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume, whence iſſued forth a ſharp corroſive Humor.</p>
                     <p>To know the Cauſes and Reaſon of theſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous Effects, I refer the Reader to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſaid Sir <hi>K. Digby</hi>'s Book; wherein he relates alſo the following.</p>

A Lady that was my Kinſwoman (ſhe was the Neece of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſcu,</hi> the Daughter of Count <hi>Arundel)</hi> came to give me Viſits ſometimes in <hi>London;</hi> ſhe was fair, and of a good Feature, add ſhe knew it well, taking great complacency, and not only to keep her ſelf ſo, but to add what ſhe could further; thereupon ſhe was perſwaded that the Patches and Flies which ſhe put upon her Face, gave her a great deal of Ornament, therefore ſhe was careful to wear the moſt curious ſort; but as it is very hard to keep a moderation in things which depend more upon <hi>Opinion</hi> than <hi>Nature,</hi> ſhe wore them in exceſs, an patched moſt of her Face with them; although that did not much add to her Beauty, and that I took the Liberty to tell her ſo accordingly, yet I thought it no opportunity then to do any thing that ſhould give her the leaſt diſtaſte, ſince with ſo much civility and ſweetneſs ſhe came to viſit me. Nevertheleſs, one day I thought good in a kind of drolling way, (ſo that ſhe might not apprehend any Diſcontentment) to tell her of it; ſo that I let fall my Diſcourſe upon her great Belly, adviſing her to have a care of her Health, whereof ſhe was ſomewhat negligent,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:41614:167"/>
and according to the Cuſtom of young vigorous women, which know not yet what it is to be ſubject to Indiſpoſitions, ſhe kindly thanked me for my care herein; ſaying, That ſhe could do no more to preſerve her health than ſhe did, though ſhe was in that caſe: you ſhould at leaſt, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, have a care of your Child: O for that, ſaid ſhe, there is nothing that can be contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more. Yet I told her, See how many Patches you wear upon your Face, are you not afraid that the Infant in your Womb may haply be born with ſuch Marks on its Face? But, ſaid ſhe, what danger is there that my Child ſhould bear ſuch Marks, though I put them on artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally? Then you have not heard, I replied again, the marvellous Effects that the Imaginations of Mothers work upon the Bodies of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, while they are yet big with them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will reaccount unto you ſome of them; ſo I related unto her ſundry Stories upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; as that of the Black Queen of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> who was delivered of a white Boy, which was attributed to a Picture of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> with our Saviour Chriſt, which ſhe had near the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of her bed, whereunto ſhe bore great devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I urg'd another of a woman who was brought to bed of a Child all hairy, becauſe of the Picture of St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when he wore a coat of Camels hair. I re-accounted unto her alſo the ſtrange Antipathy which the late King <hi>James</hi> had to a naked Sword, whereof the Cauſe was aſcribed, in regard ſome <hi>Scotch</hi> Lords entred violently into the Bed-chamber
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:41614:167"/>
of the Queen his Mother, whilſt ſhe was with Child of him, where her Secretary, an <hi>Italian,</hi> was diſpatching ſome Letters for her, whom they hack'd and kill'd with naked Swords before her face, and threw him at her feet; and they grew ſo barbarous, that there wanted but little but that they had hurt the Queen her ſelf, at leaſt her Skin was rais'd in divers places. <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canan</hi> makes mention of this Tragedy. Hence it came that her Son King <hi>James</hi> had ſuch an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion all his Life time to a naked Sword, that he could not ſee one without a great emotion of the Spirits, although otherwiſe couragious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, yet he could not overmaſter his Paſſion in that particular. I remember when he dubb'd me Knight, in the Ceremony of putting the point of a naked Sword upon my Shoulder, he could not endure to look upon it, but turned his face another way; inſomuch, that inſtead of touching my ſhoulder, he had almoſt thruſt the point into my eyes, had not the Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi> guided his hand aright. I alledged her divers ſuch Stories to make her apprehend that a ſtrong Imagination of the Mother might cauſe ſome notable impreſſion upon the Body of her Child to its prejudice. Moreover, I pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how attentive you are to your Patches, and that you have them continually in your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for I obſerved that you have looked upon them ten times ſince you came to this Room, in the Looking-Glaſs. Have you therefore no apprehenſion that your Child may be born with
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:41614:168"/>
half Moons upon its Face, or rather that all the Black which you wear up and down in ſmall portions, may aſſemble in one, and appear in the middle of its Forehead, the moſt apparent and remarkable part of the Viſage, and may be as broad as a <hi>Jacobus,</hi> and then what a Grace would it be to the Child? O me, ſaid ſhe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that ſhould happen, I will wear no more Patches while I am with Child; thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at that inſtant ſhe pull'd them off, and hurl'd them away. When her Friends ſaw her after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards without Patches, they demanded how it came to paſs that ſhe who was eſteemed to be one of the moſt curious Beauties of the Court, in point of Patches, ſhould ſo ſuddenly give over the wearing of them; She anſwered, that her Unkle, in whom ſhe had a great deal of Belief, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her, that if ſhe wore them during the time ſhe was with child, the Infant would have a large black Patch in the midſt of its Forehead. Now this Conceit was ſo lively engraven in her Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that ſhe could not be delivered of it; and ſo this poor Lady that was ſo fearful that her Child might bear ſome black Mark in its Forehead; and ſo it happened, that it was born into the World with a ſpot as large as a ten Shilling piece of Gold in its Forehead; it was a Daughter ſhe brought forth, very beautiful throughout, this excepted.</p>
                     <p>I need not tell you of your Neighbour of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſona,</hi> who lately was brought to bed of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Monſter, exactly reſembling an Ape,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:41614:168"/>
which ſhe took pleaſure to look upon during the time ſhe was with Child; for I conceive you know the Story better than I. Nor that of the Woman of St. <hi>Maxent,</hi> who could not forbear going to ſee an infortunate Child which was born without Arms; and ſhe her ſelf was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered afterwards of ſuch a Monſter.</p>
                     <p>Another dreadful Example Sir <hi>Kenelm</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, which happened to a Woman with Child, who was ſo curious as to go and ſee the Execution of a Malefactor.</p>
                     <p>Several others he relates; which for Brevity ſake I omit to relate here. What I have ſet down is by way of Caution and Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

Liquor, and you will find at the bottom and on the ſides large and fair green Chriſtals like E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merauds; drain off all the Water clean from them, and dry them; then ſpread them abroad, in a large flat earthen Diſh, and expoſe them to the hot Sun in the Dog-days, taking them in at Night, and ſetting them out in the Morning, ſecuring them from the Rain; and when the Sun hath calcin'd them to whiteneſs, beat them to Powder, and ſet this Powder again in the Sun, ſtirring it ſometimes, and when you ſee it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly white, powder it, and fift it finely, and ſet it again in the Sun for a day, and you will have a pure white Powder, which is the Powder of Sympathy; which put up in a Glaſs, and ſtop it cloſe. The next year when the Dog-days come, if you have any of this Powder left, you may expoſe it again in the Sun, ſpreading it abroad to renew its Vertue by the influence of the Sun-beams.</p>
                        <p>The way of Curing Wounds, with it, is, to take ſome of the Blood upon a Rag, and put ſome of the Powder upon the Blood, then keep only the Wound clean, with a clean Linnen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and in a moderate Temper betwixt hot and cold, and wrap up the Rag with the Blood, and keep it either in your Pocket, or in a Box, and the Wound will be healed without any Oyntment or Plaiſter, and without any pain. But if the wound be ſomewhat old, and hot, and inflamed, you muſt put ſome of this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into a Porringer or Baſon full of cold Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:41614:180"/>
and then put any thing into it that hath been upon the wound, and hath ſome of the Blood or Matter upon it, and it will preſently take away all Pain and Inflammation, as you ſee in Sir <hi>Kenelm</hi>'s Relation of Mr. <hi>Howard.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To ſtanch the Blood either of a Wound or Bleeding at the Noſe, take only ſome of the Blood upon a Rag, and put ſome Powder upon it, or take a Baſon with freſh water, and put ſome of the Powder into it, and bath the Noſtrils with it.</p>

                        <p>Let a Chymiſt prepare you an <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> with equal parts of Niter and Allum, but be ſure he do not ſell you a common one made with Niter and Vitriol.

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:41614:183"/>
the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> being warm will ſoon diſſolve all the Biſtmuth; when all is well diſſolv'd let it cool, there will remain a few black feces in the bottom which cannot be diſſolv'd, pour it into a white baſon full of fair water leaving the ſaid black dreggs behind, and it will immediately turn it as white as milk, let it ſtand five or ſix hours until the water be very clear, and the white powder be ſetled to the bottom, pour freſh water upon it and let it ſettle as before, then pour it off gently without ſtirring the powder, and put on freſh fair water; do thus ten or twelve times that the powder may be well dulcified, and freed from all the acrimony of the <hi>Aqua-fortis;</hi> then dry it in the ſhadow between two papers ſpreading it abroad upon the paper.</p>

If you will have much Gelly, two Pippins finely Pared and whole, will be enough; you may put in more, if you will have a greater Proportion of ſubſtance to the Gelly.

Let theſe infuſe thirty or forty hours: then ſtrain it from the flowers; and either work it with yeaſt or ſet it in the Sun to Work: when it hath almoſt done working, put into it a bag of like Gilliflowers (and if they be duly dryed, I think they are the better) hanging in it at the Bung. I conceive that bitter and ſtrong herbs, as Roſemary, Bays, Sweet marjorum, Thyme, and the like, do conſerve Mead the better and longer; being as it were inſtead of Hops. But neither muſt they no more then Clove-gilliflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, be too much boyled; for the volatile pure Spirit flies away very quickly: therefore rather infuſe them. Beware of Infuſing Gilliflowers in any Veſſel of Metal (excepting ſilver) for all metals will ſpoyl and dead their colour. Glazed earth is beſt.</p>

Do then thus: Chuſe good Apples, Red-ſtreak are the beſt for Syder to keep, Gennet-Moils the next, then Pippins, let them lye about three weeks after they are Gathered; then ſtamp and ſtrain them in the ordinary way into a wooden Fat that hath a Spiggot, three or four fingers breadth above the bottom.

After twenty four hours draw off it, to ſee if it be clear by the ſetling of all the dregs, above which the ſpigot muſt be.
