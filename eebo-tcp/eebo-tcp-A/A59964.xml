         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the <hi>Corban,</hi> they evacuated this Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Piety; Justice, Compassion, and Natural

Mysteries of Religion, and nothing provoked
their indignation so much, as to be thought <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;</hi>
wherefore they so huffingly tell the poor
Man restored to his sight by our Saviour, <hi>dost
thou teach us, Ioh.</hi> 9. 34. tho by the most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Arguments, he had just before exposed
both their shameful Ignorance and Vanity; and
when St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself was tinctur'd with this lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
his brisk and generous Spirit was sadly
employed in persecuting the Church. There is
nothing more opposite to the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>undefiled</hi>
Religion, than Pharisaical Pride and Hypocrisy;
nor no kind of Pharisees persecute with greater
Violence and Spite, than that sullen and demure
Tribe that affect Domination and Tyranny, by a
counterfeit and disguised Humility.</p>
            <p>The sad Effects of such an insolent Humor, are
too sadly felt by the Clergy of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
Courts and Judicatories are as void of
the common Forms of Justice, as of Tenderness
and Humanity, the late Erection of it being in
its Frame more properly Calculated to advance
Tyranny, and tho their Agents propagate many
Stories to lessen and extenuate, and sometimes
to excuse their unaccountable Proceedings; yet
as long as they confess the shameful rabbling of
the Clergy, they acknowledge more Barbarity and
Cruelty, more Reproach to our Nation than can
easily be named: Certainly it cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that the Episcopal Clergy left their <hi>Houses,</hi>
their <hi>Livings,</hi> and some of them their <hi>Relations,</hi>
and their <hi>Countrey,</hi> for no other Design than to
tell Stories of the Presbyterian Persecution; any
Man that believes this, needs not refuse the
most monstrous Improbabilities: Men are not
so fond of Crosses and Afflictions, the Bias of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature is on the other side, they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prefer the Law of Self-preservation to the
Law of Self-denial, and the Doctrine of the Cross
has but few to follow it if they can avoid it.</p>

so tamely beat off the Stage? 'Tis true, many of
our Ministers are now made uncapable to serve
the Publick; yet by their sacred Character, they
are still obliged to serve the People, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Souls, for whom Christ died, from the
Enchantment and Enthusiasm of Seducers: I
hope they will defend the Gospel without fear,
upon all Occasions, in Season, and out of Season.
It is not a Question of Discipline, or Ecclesiastical
Government only, (though that be of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
in it self,) that is now debated: But the
Question is, Whether such Methods must be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
as expose Christian Religion? Whether
the People shall be taught from the Pulpit to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesque
the holy Scriptures, to lampoon Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and to ridicule the most grave and serious
things? Mankind, indeed, is liable to many Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and Follies, and yet no Follies debase Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature so much as those that put on the
Garb of Religion. 'Tis lamentable when Men
avouch the Authority of God for their own
Dreams, and plead a Divine Right for all their
new and fancied Opinions. The first Presbyterians
thought it enough to say,<note place="margin">Read the Preface to Dr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</note> that
their Model was allowable; and
therefore they levelled their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to prove such a Scheme
of Government was not altogether forbidden;
and it was never heard, that the Foreign Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians
would have refused the Communion of the
Church, because the ancient Government of Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
was retained in it: So we see all the <hi>French</hi>
Protestants, who have fled to <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>England,</hi>
serve in either Church as Ministers, according to
the Rites and Ecclesiastical Canons of the place
where they live: It is only the Covenanted Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriaus
(for any thing I know) plead a Divine
Right for their new Model, and their latter Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
are forward and daring on this Head. Their
Government must be founded on the express <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
of our Saviour, and therefore the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of their Discipline must be nothing less than
the Administrations of his Kingdom and Royal
Scep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>re: To contradict or despise them, is an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
to God himself; and to be sure, the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
of their Lay-Elders, and Commissioners
from Burghs, are all of them by Divine Right.
And yet all this is not so bold or ridiculous, as
when they endeavour to prove their Scheme by
particular Texts of Scripture. There is one that
calls himself the <hi>Vindicator of their Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of himself, that <hi>his Way is Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative;</hi>

Now let us calmly examine what Foundation

amongst his Disciples, as well as in all
other Societies; and therefore he directs such as
would climb to the highest Places, to take other
Methods than those that are most usual in World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Preferments; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he that deserved Preferment
in the Church, was to be the Servant of all; and

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e that would be great among his Brethren,
should in the first place appear full of Humility,
Condescention and Charity; And this T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>xt refers
to the Method of their <hi>Promotion,</hi> not to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation
of their <hi>Iu isdiction.</hi> He supposes one
would be great among them; and the true way to
attain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat Greatness, was not to aspire to it am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiously,
by Force and Violence, as the Lords of
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did; but by all the Acts of Modesty,
Humility and Self-denial. But let me ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Apostles understood this Precept of our
Saviour, in the Sense of the Presbyterians, or
not? If they did, how came they to exercise Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
over all inferior Ecclesiasticks, during
all their Life-time, in all the Churches they had
planted? Did they (who could not but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his meaning) go quite cross to the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our Saviour? The plain Truth is, there
is no Text in the Scripture can be alledged more
absurdly for the Presbyterian Parity, than this
Text, since our Saviour tells them, He did that
himself amongst <hi>them,</hi> which they were to do to
one <hi>another;</hi> and therefore the doing of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
one another, could not infer Parity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, unless they blasphemously infer,
that Christ and his Apostles are equal; for our
Saviour recommends what he enjoyns from his
own Practice, that he who was <hi>their</hi> Lord, was
<hi>their</hi> Servant; and therefore the greatest among
them were to be modest, calm, and humble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all their subordinate Brethren; and this
qualified them for Ecclesiastical Promotions. Is
it not very unlucky, that a Man shall write a
Book to prove the Divine Right of Presbytery,
and yet bring no other Proof for it than this
Text, which (if understood in the Presbyterian
Sense) degrades our blessed Saviour to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of one of his Disciples; for what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Apostles, he practised among them
himself: And this is the strong Motive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
their Obedience, that they should not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their Jurisdiction as the Lords of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
by a Spirit of Pride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Van<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
for he that was to be the greatest among them,
was to be their Servant: And certainly the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of the Church, by their Character, Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Station, by their publick Cares, Fears and
daily Labour, feel that they are more Servants
than Masters. When one was promoted among
the <hi>Iews,</hi> to higher Dignities, there was another
appointed to tell him, that upon that Day <hi>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to serve.</hi> And did not St. <hi>Paul</hi> think so of
himself, though in nothing behind the chiefest
Apostles, when the Care of all the Churches lay
upon him? And all the Fathers of the Church,
from the first Plantations of Christianity, had
this Notion of their Dignity, that they were the
Servants of all.</p>
            <p>Now when this one Text is answered, I think
his Book is answered, nor had this part of that
Pamphlet been touched here, if it had not been
commonly insisted on by others as well as by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his
Author. Now if I should yield that there was any
foundation for Ecclesiastical Parity in this Text,
it cannot be stretched so far, as to prove the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
and Classical Presbytery, it rather favours
the Congregrational Model, which always appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to me much more innocent and allowable, than
this new and unaccountable Platform of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.

               </gap>ents
of one of their Number: And therefore I
challenge any Man to let me see any one Article,
wherein he is inconsequential either to himself,
or to the received Doctrine of the Party; for as
long as the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Standard of their Sect, the Dictates of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Reason, and Texts of Scripture, must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,
as they may best promote the ends of
the Covenant; and therefore unless you let me see
something in the Book not allowed by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
it is very impertinent to say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it contains
not the Presbyterians Doctrine, for I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
distinguishes the Presbyterians of <hi>Scotland</hi>
from other Dissenters; but the bloody Principles
of the Covenant by which they over-turned the
ancient Monarchy, Sacrificed the best of Kings,
and changed a prosperous Nation into a field of
Blood.</p>
            <p>The next thing I foresee their Agents will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate
is, that tho they were guilty of many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Tricks formerly, yet now (that they
are re-established) they will act with great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
for the future: But can the <hi>Aethiopian</hi>
change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? Must
not they assert their Classical Authority and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline?
Will they so shamefully desert their
<hi>Colours?</hi> Must they not give their <hi>Testimony</hi> as
their <hi>Predecessours</hi> have done? Don't we see that
they have Male-versed more in three Years time,
than can well be repaired for twenty? Will their
Agents oblige their Meetings and Assemblies to
declare against this Systeme solemnly and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially?
No, they'll keep those Opinions, and
practice them upon all Occasions; for they are
obliged to do all they can to support the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
when they may co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Cup of cold Water, The Banders disbanded,</hi>
and several other little Pamphlets, whose Titles
I have forgot; and you shall find that this is the
common Strain by which they are distinguished
from the Presbyterians abroad, as well as from all
other Christian Churches.</p>
            <p>If Episcopacy had been a grievance to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as was tumultuously alledged, it had been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to remove those venerable Persons from
the Hel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n of Ecclesiastical Government, and then
the Affairs of the Church (by the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Principles of Presbytery) should be managed
<hi>Communi Presbyterorum consilio.</hi> All the Presbyters
by their Delegates from all Corners of the Nation
had an equal Right in this Government: But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of this we have a new Model set up and the
<pb facs="tcp:59361:5"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cclestastic Government is lodged in the hands
of a few <hi>Peevish and Tyrannical Persons,</hi> who never
sleep quietly until all the Clergy be extirpate,
who do not hold their Mission from the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.
When this is objected as an extraordinary
Solecism in Justice as well as in Government,
they answer, That tho every Presbyter has a right
to govern which he cannot part with yet <hi>pro prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senti
ecclesiae statu,</hi> the Government should be thus
modell'd; and this in plain Scotch is no more,
than that the Heads of the Faction judged it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
that none should be allowed any share in
the Government, but the sworn <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nizaries</hi> of the
Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore tho the Presbyters all
over the National Church had an equal right to
govern, yet they should be restrained from the
Exercise of Government, until the Faction got
intirely uppermost. But let me ask peaceably
and calmly, By whom are they are restrained?
Either by the remainders of the Presbyterian
Preachers, or by the Secular Power: If the
first, how can threescore Suspend a thousand Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
from the Exercise of Government? Before
whom are they cited? By what Authority is this
done? Is this done by the acknowledged Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Presbytery? But if this be done by the
Secular Power, then it seems the Presbyterians
now think and teach that the Secular Power can
intrust some few Ministers with the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Government, when others are restrained, and
which is still more absurd. they allow them in
the Exercise of the more Spiritual part of their
Ministry, the Administration of Sacraments and
Preaching of the Gospel; but they must not
meddle with the Discipline of the Church: As
if the one had not been originally intended to
shelter and defend the other. However, it is
easie to observe, that the Presbyterians love Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
(by which they secure the Interest of
this World) much better than Preaching of the
Gospel, which more immediately prepares Men
for another. But if they think Presbyters may
be thus restrained from the Exercise of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Discipline, why might not the former
Government restrain Presbyterians, as well as
the present Powers restrain the Episcopal Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
from that part of their Ministry? It is very
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad that Men are driven to such Shifts as cannot
be maintained, neither by the Principles of true
Reason, nor by the peculiar Hypothesis of the
Party. They have one Answer to all this, that
the Episcopal Clergy would endeavour the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow
of Presbytery: But what they might
do as to that, I know not, I believe there are
but few of them that are very zealous to cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the present <hi>Scheme;</hi> and perhaps the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
of Presbyterians to exclude them from
the Government, is as proper a Mean to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
Presbytery, as the Admission of them int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by Mr. Alexander Sheilds, a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
Minister of the Kirk of Scotland,
as it is now Established by Law.</head>
            <p>FROM the year 1570 and downward, the Testimony is sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and gradually prosecuted, for the Rights, Priviledges,
and Prerogatives of Christ's <hi>Kingly</hi> Office, which hath been
the peculiar Glory of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> above all the
Churches in the Earth, that this hath been given to her as
the word of her Testimony; and not only consequentially and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,
as all other Churches may challenge a part of this dignity, but
formally and explicitely to contend for this very head, <hi>The Headship
and Kingship of Iesus Christ,</hi> the Prince of the Kings of the Earth, and
his mediatory <hi>Supremacy</hi> over his own Kingdom of Grace, both visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and invisible. This is Christ's <hi>Supremacy,</hi> a special radiant Jewel
of his Imperial Crown: which, as it hath been as explicitely incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by his insolent Enemies, as ever by any that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in opposition to him, so it hath been more explicitely witnessed
and wrestled for, by his Suffering Servants in that Land, than in any
place of the World. This was in a particular manner, the Testimony
of that Period, during the Reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> the Sixth; as it hath
been in a great measure in our day, since the Year 1660. Which, as
it is the most important Cause, of the greatest Consequence that Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
can contend for; so it hath this Peculiar Glory in it, that it is
not only for a Truth of Christ, of greater value than the standing of
Heaven and Earth, but also it is the very Truth for which Christ
himself Dyed, considered as a <hi>Martyr;</hi> And which concerns him to
vindicate and maintain as a Monarch. The Witnesses of that day made
such an high account of it, that they encouraged one another to suffer
for it, as the greatest Concern; <hi>Being a Witness for Christ's Glorious and
free Monarchy, which as it is the end of the other two Offices, so the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59361:6"/>
is more Glorious to God, more Honourable to his Son, and more
Comfortable to them, than the Testimony either for his Prophetical
Office, or for his Priest-hood, because his Kingdom was specially im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned
at the time; as Mr. <hi>Forbess</hi> and Mr. <hi>Welsh</hi> writ in a Letter to
the Ministers at Court. The Corruptions and Usurpations wronging
this Truth, that they contended against, were <hi>Prelacy</hi> and the King's
<hi>Supremacy</hi> in Ecclesiastical Matters: Which will be useful to hint a little,
how they prosecuted the Conflict. When <hi>Sathan</hi> by several Instruments
and Means, both by force and frauds did endeavour to put a stop to
the Reformation, by re-introducing the Antichristian Hierarchy of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y,</hi>
when he could not reestablish the Antichristian Doctrine of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;
he left no means unessayed to effectuate it. And first he began to
bring the name of <hi>Bishop</hi> in request, that was now growing obsolete and
odious. And indeed his first Essay reached little further than the bare
Name, for they were to be Subject to, and tried by Assemblies, and
hardly had so much power as Superintendents before. But it was a
fine Court-juggle for Noblemen to get the Church Revenues into their
hand, by restoring the Ecclesiastical Titles, and obtaining from the
Titulars either Temporal Lands, or Pensions to their Dependers.
The faithful Servants of Christ did zealously oppose it. Mr. <hi>Knox</hi>
denounced <hi>Anathema</hi> to the Giver, and <hi>Anathema</hi> to the Receiver. And
the following Assembly condemned the Office it self, as having <hi>no sure
Warrant, Authority, nor Ground in the Book of God; and ordained all that
brooked the Office, to demit</hi> Simpliciter, <hi>and to desist and cease from Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
while they received</hi> de novo <hi>admission from the General Assembly, under
the Pain of Excommunication.</hi> In pursuance whereof, the Assemblies from
that time until the Year 1681. did with much painfulness and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
attend the work; until by perfecting of the second Book of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
they compleated their work, in the exact Model of <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Government.</hi> Which was confirmed, and covenanted to be kept
inviolate, in the <hi>National Covenant,</hi> Subscribed that Year by the King,
his Court, and Council; and afterwards by all Ranks of People in the
Land. Whence it may be doubted, whether the Impudence of the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prelates that denyed this, or their Perjury in breaking of it, be greater.
This was but the first brush: A brisker Assault follows. Wherein, for
the better establishment of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and not only <hi>Diocesan</hi> but also <hi>Erastian</hi>
Prelacy might be set up, the Earl of <hi>Arran,</hi> and his wicked Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices,
move the King, contrary both to the Word and Oath of God,
to usurp the Prerogative of Jesus Christ, and assume to himself, a Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
Monster of <hi>Supremacy, over all Persons, and in all Causes, as
well Ecclesiastical as Civil.</hi> But this also the Faithful Servants of God
did worthily and valiantly resist: And at the very first appearance of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59361:6"/>
it, gave in a Grievance to the King, Anno 1582. <hi>That he had taken
upon him a Spiritual Power, which properly belongs to Christ, as only King
and Head of the Church; the Ministry and Execution whereof, is only given
to such as bear Office in the Ecclesiastical Government in the same: So that
in the King's Person, some Men press to erect a new Popedome, as though he
would not be full King of this Common-wealth, unless as well the Spiritual
as Temporal Sword be put in his hand, unless Christ be rest of his Authority,
and the two Iurisdictions confounded, which God hath divided, which directly
tendeth to the Wrack of all true Religion.</hi> Which being presented by the
Commissioners of the General Assembly; the Earl of <hi>Arran</hi> asked, with
a Frowning Countenance, who dare Subscribe these Treasonable Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles?
Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> answered, we dare, and will Subscribe, and
render our Lives in the Cause. And afterward, that same Assembly
presented Articles, shewing, that <hi>seeing the Spiritual Iurisdiction of the
Church is granted by Christ, and given only to them, that by Preaching,
Teaching, and Overseeing, bear Office within the same, to be exercised, not
by the Injunctions of Men, but by the only Rule of God's Word, hereafter, no
other of whatsoever degree, or under whatsoever pretence, have any colour
to ascribe, or to take upon them any part thereof, either in placing or displacing
of Ministers, without the Churches admission, or in stopping the Mouths of
Preachers, or putting them to silence, or take upon them the Iudgement of
Tryal of Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But in contempt and Contradiction to this, and to Prosecute and
Exert this new usurped Power, Mr. <hi>Andrew Melvil</hi> was sommoned
before the Secret Council, for a Sermon of his, applying his Doctrine
to the Times Corruptions: Whereupon he gave in his Declinature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them as incompetent Judges; and told them <hi>They were too bold,
in a Constitute Christian Church, to pass by the Pastors, Prophets, and
Doctors, and to take upon them to judge the Doctrine, and to controul the
Ambassadours of a greater than was there, which they neither ought nor can
do. There are</hi> (saith he, loosing a little Hebrew <hi>Bible</hi> from his Girdle)
<hi>my Instructions and Warrant; see if any of you can controul me, that I
have past my Injunctions.</hi> For this he was decerned to be warded in the
Castle of <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> But he conveyed himself secretly out of the
Countrey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When as also a Convention in</hi> Faulkand <hi>was consulting to call home
the Papist Lords; Mr.</hi> Andrew Melvil <hi>went thither uncalled; and when
found fault with by the King for his Boldness, he answered,</hi> Sir, I have
a Call to come here from Christ and his Church, who have special Interest in
this Turn, and against whom this Convention is Assembled directly: I charge
you, and your Estates, in the Name of Christ and his Church, that ye
favour not his Enemies, whom he hateth, nor go about to call home nor make
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59361:7"/>
Citizens of these, &amp;c. <hi>And further challenged them of</hi> Treason against
Christ, his Church and Countrey, <hi>in that purpose they were about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>About the same time in a private Conference with the King, he
called the King,</hi> Gods silly Vassal; <hi>and taking him by the Sleeve, told
him;</hi> Sir, I must tell you, there are two Kings, and two Kingdoms; There
is Christ, and his Kingdom whose Subject King <hi>James</hi> the 6th is, and of
whose Kingdom he is not a King, nor a Head, nor a Lord, but a Member;
And they whom Christ hath called to Watch over and Govern his Church,
have sufficient Authority, and Power from him, which no Christian King
should controul, but assist; otherwise they are not Faithful Subjects to Christ.
Sir, when you were in your Swadling-Clouts, Christ Reigned freely in this
Land, in spight of all his Enemies; but now the Wisdom of your Council,
is Devilish and Pernicious, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the like effect, Mr.</hi> Robert Bruce, <hi>in a Sermon upon</hi> Psal. 51. <hi>gives
faithful warning of the Danger of the Times.</hi> It is not we <hi>(sayes he)</hi>
that are Partie in this Cause; no, the Quarrel is betwixt a greater Prince
and them. What are we, but silly Men? Yet it has pleased him to set us in
this Office, that we should oppone to the manifest Vsurpations that is made
upon his Spiritual Kingdom. Is there a more forcible means to draw down
the Wrath of God, than to let <hi>Barrabas</hi> that nobilitate Malefactour pass free,
and to begin the War against Christ and his Ministry? It putteth on the
Copestone, that so many of our Brethren should not be so faithful, as their
calling and this Cause craveth. Fie upon false Brethren, to see them dumb,
so faint hearted, when it comes to the Chock: not only are they as ashamed
to speak the thing they think which is a shame in a Pastor, but speak
directly against their former Doctrine. They will speak the Truth a while,
till they be put at, but incontinent they will turn and make their Gifts
Weapons to fight against Christ, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Hereafter when the Parliament 1584. had Enacted this Supremacy,
and Submission to Prelacy, to be Subscribed by all Ministers; the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
first directed Mr. <hi>David Lindsay</hi> to the King, desiring that nothing
be done in Parliament prejudicial to the Churches Liberty: Who got
the Prison of <hi>Blackness</hi> for his pains. And then when they could not
get access for shut doors to Protest before the Parliament; yet, when
the Acts were Proclaimed at the Cross of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> they took pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Documents, in name of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (tho' they were
but two) that they protested against the said Acts: And fled to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
leaving behind them Reasons that moved them to do so. And
Mr <hi>Iames Melvil,</hi> wrote against the Subscribers at that time, proving,
<hi>That they had not only set up a new Pope, and so become Traitours to Christ,
and condescended to that chief Error of Papistry, whereupon all the rest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend;
but further, in so doing they had granted more to the King, than ever
the Popes of Rome peaceably obtained, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59361:7"/>
After this it is known what bickerings the faithful Witnesses of Christ
had, in their Conflicts with this Supremacy upon the account of Mr.
<hi>David Blacks</hi> Declinature, which they both advised him to, and approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
when he gave it in, against the King and Council, as Judges of his
Doctrine. And the Commissioners of the General Assembly ordained
all, to deal mightily with the power of the Word, against the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
Excroachments: For which they were charged to depart forth of
<hi>Edinburgh.</hi> After which he added a second Declinature: Declaring,
<hi>There are two Iurisdictions in this Realm, the one Spiritual, the other Civil;
the one respecting the Conscience, the other Externals: Therefore, in so far
as he was one of the Spiritual Office-bearers, and had discharged his Spiritual
calling in some measure of Grace and Sincerity, should not nor could not be
Lawfully judged, for Preaching and applying the Word, by any Civil Power;
he being an Ambassadour and Messenger of the Lord Iesus, having his
Commission from the King of Kings, and all his Instructions set down and
limited in the Book of God, that cannot be extended, abridged, or altered
by any mortal Wight, King or Emperor; And seeing he was sent to all sorts,
his Commission and Discharge of it should not nor cannot be Lawfully judged,
by them to whom he was sent; they being Sheep and not Pastours, to be
judged by the Word, and not to be judges thereof in a judicial way.</hi> The
<hi>Interloquutor</hi> being past against him for this; the Brethren thought it
Duty, that the Doctrine of the Preachers should be directed against
the said <hi>Interloquutor,</hi> as against a strong hold set up against the Lord
Jesus, and the freedom of the Gospel; and Praised God for the Force
and Unity of the Spirit, that was among themselves. And being
charged to depart out of Town, they leave a faithful Declaration at
large; shewing, how the Liberties of the Church were invaded and
robbed: And when the Ministers were troubled upon Mr. <hi>Blacks</hi> busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and there was an intention to pull them out of their Pulpits,
the General Assembly advised them to stand to the Discharge of their
Calling, if their Flocks would save them from Violence; and yet this
Violence was expected from the King and his Emissaries. And when
Mr. <hi>Black</hi> had a Remission offered to him, refus'd it altogether, lest so
doing he should condemn himself and approve the Courts Proceedings:
And the Brethren conferring with the Counsellors, craving that some
penalty should be condescended unto for satisfying his Majesty in his
Honour, would not condescend to any how light soever; lest thereby
they should seem to approve the Judicatory and their proceeding. The
imprisoned Ministers, for declining the Council, had it in their offer,
that if they would without any confession of offence only submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to his Majesty, <hi>pro scandalo accepto, non dato,</hi> they should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to their places: But they could not do it without betraying the
Cause of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59361:8"/>
The Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> were committed to Ward, for refusing
to pray for the Queen, before her Execution in <hi>Fothringam</hi> Castle 1586.
they refused not simply to pray for her, but for the Preservation of
her Life, as if she had been innocent of the Crimes laid to her charge,
which had imported a Condemnation of the Proceedings against her.</p>
            <p>Afterwards in the Year 1600. the Ministers of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> would not
Praise God for the Delivery of the King, from a Conspiracy of the
Earl of <hi>Gowrie</hi> at that time, of which they had no Credit, nor assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
and would not crave Pardon for it neither. For this Mr.
<hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> was deprived of the Exercise of his Ministry, and never
obtained it again at <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this was nothing, in Comparison of their wrestlings for
the Royalties of their Princely Master, and Priviledges of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
against that Tyrants Insolencies, after he obtained the Crown
of <hi>England.</hi> For then he would not suffer the Church to indict her
own Assemblies. And when the faithful thought themselves obliged
to counteract his Encroachments, and therefore convened in an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at <hi>Aberdeen, Anno</hi> 1605. they were forced to dissolve: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
the most eminent of the Ministers there Assembled, were Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
Prisoners to <hi>Blackness.</hi> Whence being cited before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
they decline their Judicatory. And one of their Brethren, Mr.
<hi>Robert Youngson,</hi> who had formerly succumbed, being mov'd in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
returned: And, when the rest were standing before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
desired to be heard; and acknowledged his Fault, and Subscribed
the Declinature with the rest. And for this they were Arraigned, and
Condemned, as Guilty of Treason, and Banished. Before the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of which Sentence, Mr. <hi>Welsh</hi> wrote to the Lady <hi>Fleeming,</hi> to
this effect; <hi>What am I, that he should first have called me, and then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
me a Minister of glad things, of the Gospel of Salvation, these
fifteen Years already, and now last of all to be a sufferer for his Cause and
Kingdom? To witness that good Confession, that Iesus Christ is the King
of Saints, and that his Church is a most free Kingdom, yea as free as any
Kingdom under Heaven, not only to Convocate, Hold, and keep her Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Conventions and Assemblies: But also to judge of all her Affairs in
all her Meetings and Conventions, among his Members and Subjects. These
two points, (1) That Christ is the Head of his Church, (2) That she is
free in her Government from all other Iurisdiction, except Christ</hi>'s, <hi>are the
special Cause of our Imprisonment, being now convict as Traytors, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
thereof. We have now been waiting with joyfulness to give the last
Testimony of our Blood in Confirmation thereof. If it would please our God
to be so favourable, as to Honour us with that Dignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this, the King resolving by Parliament to advance the Estate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59361:8"/>
of Bishops again, as in the time of Popery, without Cautions, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and further to establish not only that Antichristian Hierarchy,
but an Erastian Supremacy; The faithful Ministers of Christ, thought
themselves bound in Conscience to protest. And accordingly they
offered a faithful Protestation to the Parliament</hi> Iuly 1606. <hi>obtesting,</hi>
That they would reserve into the Lords own hands, that Glory which he will
communicate neither with Man nor Angel; to wit, to prescribe from his
Holy Mountain a lively Pattern, according to which his own Tabernacle
should be formed: Remembring always, that there is no absolute and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Authority in this World, except the Soveraign Authority of Christ
the King; to whom it belongeth as properly to rule the Church, according
to the good Pleasure of his own Will, as it belongeth to save his Church by
the Merit of his own Sufferings: All other Authority is so entrenched within
the Marches of Divine Command, that the least overpassing of the Bounds
set by God himself, bring Men under the fearful expectation of Temporal
and Eternal Iudgements, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding of all opposition, Prelacy was again restored in
Parliament. And, to bring all to a complyance with the same, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries
and Synods universally charged, under highest pains, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a <hi>Constant Moderator</hi> without change: which many refused resolutely,
as being the first step of Prelacy. Upon this followed a great Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of the faithful, for their Nonconformity, managed by that
Mongrel and Monstrous kind of Court, made up of Clergy-men, and
States-men, called the <hi>High Commission Court,</hi> erected <hi>anno</hi> 1570. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
many honest Men were put violently from their Charges and
Habitations; the Generality were involved in a great and fearful
Defection.</p>
            <p>But the Copestone of the wickedness of that Period, was the Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the <hi>five Articles of</hi> Perth; <hi>kneeling at the Communion, private
Communion to be given to the Sick, private Baptism, and Confirmation of
Children by the Bishop, and Observation of Festival Days.</hi> Which were
much opposed and testified against by the faithful, from their first
hatching <hi>Anno</hi> 1618. to the Year 1621. when they were ratified in
Parliament. And against this the Testimony of the faithful continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
till the Revolution <hi>Anno</hi> 1638.</p>
            <p>The following Period, from the Year 1638 to 1660<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> continues and
advances the Testimony, to the greatest heighth of purity and power,
that either this Church, or any other did ever arrive unto. We shall
give a short deduction of the rise, progress, and end of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendings
of that Period.</p>
            <p>In the midst of the forementioned Miseries and Mischiefs, that the
Pride of Prelacy and Tyrannical Supremacy had multiplied beyond
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59361:9"/>
measure upon this Church and Nation, and at the heighth of all their
haughtiness, when they were setting up their Dagon, and erecting Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
for him, imposing the Service Book, and Book of Cannons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The Lords People were surprized with a sudden unexpected Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
by very despicable means; even the opposition of a few weak
Women; which afterwards was followed out with more Masculine fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
accosting King and Council with Pititions, Remonstrances, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations,
and Testimonies against the Innovations, and resolving up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a mutual Conjunction, to defend Religion, Lives, and Liberties,
against all that would innovate or invade them. To fortifie which,
all the Friends to the Liberty of the Nation, did solemnly renew the
National Covenant; which though in it self obligeing to the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Prelatical Hierarchy, and clearly enough confirming Presbyterial
Government, yet they engaged unto it with an enlargement to suspend the
Practice of Novations already introduced, and the approbation of the
Corruptions of the present Government, with the late places and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Church Men, till they be tryed in a free General Assembly.
Which was obtained that same Year, and indicted at <hi>Glasgow:</hi> And
there, notwithstanding all the opposition that the King's Commissioner
could make, by Protestations and Proclamations to dissolve it, the six
preceding Assemblies establishing Prelacy were annulled, the Service
Book, and High Commission were condemned; all the Bishops were
deposed, and their Government declared to be abjured in that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Covenant; tho' many had, through the Commissioners perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
subscribed it in another Sense without that application: As also
the five Articles of <hi>Perth</hi> were there discovered to have been incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with that Covenant and Confession, and the Civil places and
power of Church Men were disproved and rejected: On the other hand,
Presbyterial Government was justified and approved, and an Act was
passed, for keeping Yearly General Assemblies.</p>
            <p>This was a bold beginning; out-braving all difficulties. Which
in the following Year were much encreased, by the Prelates and their
partakers, Rendezvouzing their Forces under the Kings personal
Standard, and menacing nothing but Misery to the zealous Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
Yet when they found them prepared to resist, were forced to
yield to a Ratification, concluding that an Assembly and Parliament
should be held for healing all Grievances of Church and State. In
which Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Covenant is ratified and subscribed
by the Earl of <hi>Traquaire</hi> Commissioner, and enjoyned to be subscribed by
the Body of the whole Land, with an explication expresly concerning
the five Articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> the Government of Bishops, the Civil places
and power of Church Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:59361:9"/>
But the Year following, King and Prelates, with their Abettors,
go to Arms again; but were fain to accommodate the matter by a new
Pacification, whereby all Civil and Religious Rights were ratified.
And in the following Year 1641, by Laws, Oaths, Promises, Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of King and Parliament, fully confirmed; the King, <hi>Charles</hi> the
First, being present, and consenting to all.</p>
            <p>But the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus being thus advanced, the Glory
of the Lord did shine upon us with such Splendor, that it awaked <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and animated the Lords People there to aspire to the like Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
For advice in which, because, tho' all agreed to cast off <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,</hi>
yet sundry Forms of Church Government were projected to be
set up in the room thereof, chiefly the Independent Order: Therefore
the Brethren in <hi>England</hi> wrote to the Assembly then sitting at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
who gave them answer in behalf of the Presbyterial Government. So
from henceforth the Assembly did incessantly urge <hi>Vniformity</hi> in Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
with their Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> as the chiefest of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
Prayers and Cares. And in the Year 1643 prevailed so far,
that the <hi>English</hi> Parliament did first desire that the two Nations might
be strictly united for their mutual defence against the Prelatical Faction
and their Adherents in both Kingdoms; and not to lay down Arms,
till these implacable Enemies should be brought in Subjection; and did
instantly urge for help and assistance from <hi>Scotland.</hi> Which being
sent, did return with an Olive-branch of Peace, and not without some
beginning of a Reformation in <hi>England.</hi> And afterwards a Bloody
War beginning between the King and Parliament, with great success
on the Kings side, Commissioners were sent from both Houses to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
earnestly inviting to a nearer Union of the Kingdoms, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
assistance from this Nation to their Brethren in that their great
distress. And this produced the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi> of the
three Kingdoms, first drawn up in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and approved in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and afterward embraced in <hi>England.</hi> This is
that Covenant comprehending the purpose of all Prior, and the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of all Posterior Covenants; which the Representative of Church
and State in the three Nations did solemnly Subscribe and Swear, for
themselves and <hi>Posterity;</hi> and of which the Obligation cannot be Disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null'd,
Disabled, or Dispensed, by any Power on Earth. And this
Covenant was rigorously imposed upon all Recusants; who were wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Enemies to God, and Church, and Nation, and for their Malignancy
were then to be Prosecuted, not for their Scrupling at a Covenant,
but for their contumacious contempt of a Law. This was no violence
done to their Conscience; for as they had none, and could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to any, so they were never troubled for that, but for their opposition
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59361:10"/>
and conspiracy against the common Cause. However it went through
at that time. And that the Covenanted Reformation, in a nearer
Conjunction betwixt the united Churches, might be promoted, the
Parliament of <hi>England</hi> called an Assembly of Divines at <hi>Westminster:</hi>
And desired the Assembly of <hi>Scotland</hi> to send thither their Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners;
and they accordingly nominated and elected, Mr. <hi>Alexander Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derson,</hi>

to Propone, Consult, Treat, and Conclude in all such things as might
conduce to the extirpation of <hi>Prelacy, &amp;c.</hi> and for the settling of the
so much desired Union of the whole Island, in one Form of Church
Government, one Confession of Faith, one common Catechism, and
one Directory for the Worship of God. Forces were also sent to assist
the Parliament of <hi>England:</hi> Which were favoured with great success
in their Enterprizes, till that War was ended by the total overthrow
of the King, and all his upholders.</p>
            <p>But that Prelatical and Malignant Faction being brought much under
in <hi>England,</hi> attempted to try the Fortune of War in <hi>Scotland,</hi> under
the Conduct of <hi>Montrose:</hi> Who, tho' he prevailed for a time, yet at
length was defeat at <hi>Philliphaugh,</hi> in the Year 1645. yet certain it is
that they had Commission and Warrant from the King; as the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
that Year, <hi>Feb.</hi> 13. remonstrates it to himself: <hi>Warning him in the
Name of their Master, the Lord Iesus Christ, that the Guilt which cleaved
to his Throne was such, as if not timely repented, could not but involve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and his Posterity, under the Wrath of the Everliving God, for his
being Guilty of the shedding of the Blood of many Thousands of his best
Subjects, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>At the same time also the Assembly did zealously incite the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to a speedy Course of Justice against these Incendiaries and
Murderers, as the only mean of cleansing the Land from that deluge
of Blood then Current, and of appeasing the Wrath of God: And
solemnly and seasonably warned all Ranks to search to understand
the Language of that Dispensation; wherein many publick Sins and
Breaches of Covenant are pointed at; and the Covenant it self is there
very Encomiastically vindicated:</hi> We are so far from repenting of it
<hi>(say they)</hi> that we cannot mention it without great joy; for no sooner was
the Covenant begun to be taken in <hi>England,</hi> but sensibly the condition of
affairs there was changed to the better; and our Forces sent into that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
in pursuance of that Covenant, have been so manifestly and mercifully
assisted from Heaven, that we have what to answer the Enemy that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth
us concerning that business. <hi>These following Acts were made,

fear of Religion and Cause of God, they must now or never appear actively,
each one stretching himself to, yea beyond his power. It is no time to dally,
or to go about the business by halves, nor be almost but altogether zealous:
Cursed is he that doth the work of the Lord negligently. If we have been
forward to assist our Neighbour Kingdoms, shall we neglect to defend our own?
Or shall the Enemies of God be more active against his Cause, than his People
for it? God forbid. <hi>(And among the</hi> Enormities and Corruptions of the

grievous defection from the publick Cause, to comply with these Malignants,

Censured to be suspended from the Communion, and while they acknowledge

prescribed by the Acts of Assembly, wherein if they be negligent, they are
to be Censured. <hi>And July ult. 1648. Sess. 2. in their Declaration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the unlawful Engagement, they say:</hi> Suppose the Ends of that
Engagement be good (as they are not) yet the means and ways of Prosecution
are unlawful; because there is not an equal avoiding of Rocks on both hands,
but a joyning with Malignants to suppress Sectaries, a joining hands with a
black Devil to beat a white Devil. <hi>And Aug.</hi> 3. 1648. All Ministers that
do not apply their Doctrine to the Corruptions of the Time, which is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal
Gift, and that are cold or wanting of Spiritual zeal, Dissembling of
Publick Sins, are appointed to be Censured even to Deprivation; for forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or passing in silence the Errors and Exorbitances of Sectaries in <hi>England,</hi>
or the Defections current at home, the Plots and Practices of Malignants,
the Principles and Tenets of Erastianism; And if they be found too sparing,
General or Ambiguous in their Applications or Reproofs, they are to be deposed,
for being pleasers of Men rather than servers of Christ, for giving themselves
to a detestable indifferency or neutrality in the Cause of God, for defrauding
the South of People, yea for being Gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and strictness, in opposition to all degrees of Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

In the mean while, the Malignants in <hi>England</hi> being crushed in all
their Projects, the King renders himself to the <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>Newcastle:</hi> By
whom (because by Covenant they were not obliged to defend him,
but only in defence of Religion and Liberty, which he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying,
and they defending; because in this War he did directly
oppose and oppugn these Conditions, under which they were only to
defend him, and therefore they had all along carried towards him as
an Enemy, as he to them; And because by the same Covenant they
were obliged to discover, and render to condign Punishment all Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of whom he was the chief, and to assist mutually all entred into
that Covenant) he was delivered up unto the <hi>English,</hi> and kept under
restraint in the <hi>Isle</hi> of <hi>Wight,</hi> until he was Condemned and Executed,
<hi>Ian, 30, 164<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> Which Fact, tho' it was protested against both before and
after by the Assembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> out of zeal against the
Sectarians, the Executioners of that extraordinary Act of Justice; yet
it was more for the Manner, than for the matter, and more for the
Motives and Ends of it, than for the Grounds of it, that they opposed
themselves to it, and resented it. For they acknowledged and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
to himself, the Truth of all these things upon which that
Sentence and Execution of Justice was founded. And when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Engagement was on foot to Rescue him, they opposed it with all
their might: Shewing, in their Answers to the Estates that Year, 1648,
and Declarations and Remonstrances, the sinfulness and destructiveness
of that Engagement; that it was a breach of the Commandments of
God, and of all the Articles of the Covenant: Declaring with all
<hi>(Iuly ult.)</hi> they would never consent to the King's Restitution to the
exercise of his Power, till security should be had, <hi>By Solemn Oath under
his Hand and Seal, that he shall for himself and Successors, give his assent
to all Acts and Bills for enjoyning Presbyterial Government, and never make
opposition to it, nor endeavour any change thereof.</hi> July ult. 1648. Sess. 21.
By which it appears, they were not so stupidly loyal, as some would
make them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet there was too much of this Plague of the</hi> Kings-evil <hi>even among
good Men: For after the Death of</hi> Charles <hi>the First, in the Year 1649.
they began to think of joyning once more with the Malignants, and
taking into their Bosoms these Serpents which had formerly stung them
to Death. There was indeed at that time a Party faithful for God,
who considering the many Breaches of the Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and particularly by the late Engagement against</hi> England, <hi>did so
Travel, that they procured the Covenant to be renewed, with</hi> the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Acknowledgment of Sins, and Engagement to Duties, <hi>which was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
Subscribed and sworn through all the Land; wherein also they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59361:11"/>
regret this tampering with Malignants. Whereupon they subdued
their Adversaries at</hi> Sterling, <hi>and in the</hi> North <hi>they did also give
Warning concerning the Young King,</hi> that notwithstanding of the Lords
Hand against his Father, yet he hearkens to the Councils of those, who were
Authors of these Miseries to his Father; by which it hath co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e to pass, that
he hath hitherto refused to grant the just and necessary desires of the Church and
Kingdom, for securing of Religion and Liberty: And it is much to be feared,
that these wicked Counsellors, may so far prevail upon him, as to engage him
in a War, for overturning the Work of God, and bearing down all those in
the three Kingdoms that adhere thereto. Which if he shall do, cannot but
bring great Wrath from the Lord upon himself and Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>one, and must be the
cause of many new and great Miseries and Calamities to these Lands. And,
whereas many would have admitted his Majesty to the Exercise of his Royal
Power, upon any Terms whatsoever, the Assembly declares, That in the League
and Covenant the duty of defending and preserving the King is subordinate
to the duty of preserving Religion and Liberty: And therefore, he standing
in opposition to the publick desires of the People for their security, it were a
manifest breach of Covenant, and a preferring the Kings Interest to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of Iesus Christ, to bring him to the Exercise of his Power. <hi>And
therefore,</hi> if his Majesty, or any having or pretending Power and Commission
from him, shall invade this Kingdom, upon pretext of establishing him in the
Exercise of his Royal Power; as it will be an high Provocation against God,
to be accessary or assisting thereto, so it will be a necessary Duty to resist and
oppose the same. <hi>July 27. 1649. Sess. 27. And when the bringing home
of the King came to be voted in the Assembly, there was one faithful
Witness, Mr.</hi> Adam Kae <hi>Minister, in</hi> Gallaway, <hi>protested against it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithstanding of these Convictions, Warning, yea and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
of the Kings Malignancy; They sent Commissioners, and
concluded a Treaty with him at <hi>Breda.</hi> During which Treaty, the
Commissions which he had sent to <hi>Montrose,</hi> and his Complices, were
brought to the Committee of Estates, discovering what sort of King
they were treating with. Whereupon the Estates concluded to break
off the Treaty, and recal their Commissioners. To which intent,
they sent an Express with Letters to <hi>Breda;</hi> which falling into the
hands of <hi>Libbertone,</hi> was by him, without the knowledge of the other
Commissioners, delivered unto the King: Who then sound it his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
to dissemble. And so sending for the Commissioners, he made
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> flattering Speech to them, shewing that now after serious delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was resolved to comply with all their Proposals. Whereupon
the Commissioners dispatch the Post back with Letters, full of praise
and joy, for the satisfaction they had received.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Estates, being over-swayed more with respect to their own
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59361:12"/>
Credit (which they thought should be impeached, if they should retract
their own Plenipotentiary Instructions, to conclude the Treaty upon
the Kings assent to their Conditions) than to their reclamant Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they resolved to bring home the King. Yet they thought to mend
the matter, by binding him with all Cords, and putting him to all
most explicite Engagements, before he should receive the Imperial
Crown. Well, upon these Terms home he comes: And before he set
his Foot on British Ground, he takes the Covenant. And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of the General Assembly precluded his Admittance to the Crown,
if he should refuse the then required satisfaction, before his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by their Act at the</hi> West-Kirk, Aug. 13. 1650. <hi>Which is this,</hi>
The Commission of the General Assembly, considering that there may be just
Ground of stumbling, from the Kings Majesties refusing to subscribe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the Declaration offered to him by the Committee of Estates, and the
Commission of the General Assembly concerning his former Carriage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions
for the future, in Reference to the Cause of God, and the
Enemies and Friends thereof; doth therefore declare, That this <hi>Kirk</hi> and
Kingdom doth not own or espouse any Malignant Party, or Quarrel, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
but that they fight meerly upon their former Grounds and Principles,
and in the defence of the Cause of God, and of the Kingdom, as they have
done these twelve Years past: And therefore, as they disclaim all the Sin and
Guilt of the King and of his House, so they will not own him not his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
otherwise than with a Subordination to God, and so far as he owns and
Prosecutes the Cause of God, and disclaims his and his Fathers Opposition to
the Work of God, and to the Covenant, and likewise all the Enemies thereof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
And that they will with convenient speed take into Consideration the Papers
lately sent unto them by <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and vindicate themselves from
all the falshoods contained therein; especially in these things wherein the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
betwixt us and that Party is mis-stated, as if we owned the late Kings
Proceedings, and were resolved to Prosecute and Maintain His Present
Majesties Interest, before and without acknowledging of the Sin of his House
and former ways, and satisfaction to Gods People in both Kingdoms. <hi>A. Ker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that same day,</hi> The Committee of Estates, having seen and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
a Declaration of the Commission of the General Assembly, anent the
stating the Quarrel wherein the Army is to fight, do approve the same, and
heartily concur therein. <hi>Tho. Henderson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereupon thereafter, he encites that Declaration at</hi> Drumfermling,
<hi>Wherein,</hi> Professing and appearing in the full perswasion and Love of the
Truth, he repenteth (as having to do with and in the sight of God) his Fathers
opposition to the Covenant and Work of God, and his own Reluctances against
the same, hoping for Mercy through the Blood of Iesus Christ, and obtesting
the Prayers of the Faithful to God, for his stedfastness; and then Protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59361:12"/>
his Truth and Sincerity in entring into the Oath of God, resolving to
prosecute the Ends of the Covenant to his utmost, and to have with it the
same common Friends and Enemies, exhorting all to lay down their Enmity
against the Cause of God, and not to prefer Mans Interest to Gods, which
will prove an Idol of Iealousie to Provoke the Lord, and he himself account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be but selfish Flatteries. <hi>Then at his Coronation, the Action
commenceth with his most solemn renewing of the National and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereafter in the Year 1651. followed the Ratification of all these
preceding Treaties, Transactions, and Engagements, concluded and
enacted by the King, and the Parliament; whereby the same did Pass
into a Perpetual Law. And this Covenant, which from the beginning
was and is the most sure and indispensible Oath of God, became at
length the very Fundamental Law of the Kingdom, whereon all the
Rights or Priviledges, either of King or People, are principally bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
and secured.</p>
            <p>After this it came to pass, that zeal for the cause rightly stated was
suddenly contracted to a few; whereby a plain defection was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
carried on by the <hi>Publick Resolutioners,</hi> who relapsing into that
most Sinful Conjunction with the Malignants, did bring them into
places of Power and Trust, in Judicatories and Armies, in a more
Politick than Pious way, requiring of them a constrained and dissembled
Repentance, which Reflection did cause the first Division of that kind,
and most permanent of any that ever was in the Church of <hi>Scotland;</hi>
by reason of the surcease of General Assemblies, stopped and hindered
by the Yoke of the Sectarian Usurpers: And it has been the spring
and source of all our Reflections since. Upon this our Land was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
by <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> who defeated our Army at <hi>Dunbar.</hi> Next,
an Army being raised, according to these unhallowed Resolutions, was
totally routed at <hi>Worcester;</hi> And the King forced to hide himself in
the Oak, and thence to transport himself beyond Sea, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in <hi>Exile,</hi> till the Year 1660.</p>
            <p>Yet there was still a faithful Remnant of Ministers and Professors,
zealous for the Cause, keeping their Integrity; who in their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances
and Testimonies witnessed against both their Malignant Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and their backsliding Brethren the Resolutioners: And also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Sectarians their Invaders; whose vast Toleration and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Conscience, which they brought in to invade our Religion as
they invaded our Land, and infect it with their Multifarious Errors,
was particularly by the Synod of <hi>Fife,</hi> and other Brethren in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
that joyned themselves to them, testified against, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
to be wicked and intollerable. But in the mean time, the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59361:13"/>
Sectarian Army here prevailed, till after the Usurper <hi>Cromwell</hi> his
Death; <hi>Monk</hi> then General, with a Combination of Malignants and
publick Resolutioners, did bring home the King to <hi>England</hi> from his
Banishment.</p>
            <p>Now comes the last Catastrophe of the Deformation of the Church
of <hi>Scotland;</hi> which in a retrograde motion hath gradually been grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these 27 Years, going back through all the steps by which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
ascended, till now she is reduced to the very Border of that
<hi>Babilon,</hi> from whence she took her departure. Through all which steps
notwithstanding, to this day, <hi>Scotland</hi> hath never wanted a Witness
for Christ, against all the various steps of the Enemies advancings,
and of professed Friends declinings. Though the Testimony hath had
some Singularities, in that it hath been attended with more disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,
by reason of the Enemies greater prevalency, and Friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency,
and greater want of significant Assertors, than any formerly,
in that it hath been intangled in more multifarious Intricacies of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
and debates, and Divisions among the Assertors themselves: In
that it hath been intended and extended to a greater measure, both
as to matter and manner of contendings against the Adversaries, and
stated upon nicer points, more earnestly Prosecuted and tenaciously main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,
than any formerly; to that it hath had more opposition and
contradiction, and less Countenance from professed Friends to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
either at home or abroad, than any formerly. And yet it
hath been both Active and Passive, both against Enemies and Friends;
and <hi>in Cumulo</hi> stated against Atheism, Popery, Prelacy, and Erastian
Supremacy, and extended in a particular manner against Tyranny. And
not only against the substance and essence of these in the Abstract,
but against Substance and Circumstance, Abstract and Concrete, Root
and Branch, Head and Tail of them, and all complying with them,
conforming to them, or countenancing of them, or any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
for them, or deduced from them, any manner of way, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
or indirectly, formally or interpretatively. This is that extensive
and very comprehensive Testimony, which in all its parts, points, and
particles is most directly relative, and dilucidly reducible, to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
Witness for the Declarative Glory of <hi>Christs Kingship and Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
over All,</hi> as he is God, and as he is Mediator.</p>
            <p>The management of this Testimony was thus. King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second upon his Return directed a Letter to the Presbytery of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
declaring <hi>he was resolved to protect and preserve the Government of the
Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>as it is settled by Law, without</hi> Violation. Wherein
it was observed he spake never 8 word of the Covenant, our <hi>Magna
Charta</hi> of Religion and Righteousness, but only of <hi>Law;</hi> by which he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59361:13"/>
meant the Prelatical Church, as it was settled by the Law of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
since which time he reckoned there was no Law, but Rebellion.
This was a piece and prelude of our base Defection, that we were so
far from withstanding, that we did not so much as witness against the
Readmission and Restauration of the Head and Tail of Malignants,
but let them come in peaceably to the Throne, without any Security
to the Covenanted Cause, and by piece-meal, at their own ease, lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and pleasure, to overturn all the Work of God, and reintro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Old Antichristian Yoke of abjured Prelacy, and <hi>Blasphemous
Sacrilegious Supremacy,</hi> and absolute Arbitrary Tyranny, with all their
abominations: Which he, and with him the Generality of our Nobility,
Gentry, Clergy, and Commonality, did promote and propagate, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the Nation was involved in the greatest Revolt from, and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
against God, that ever could be recorded in any Age or Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Nay, attended with greater and grosser Aggravations, than ever
any could be capable of before us, who have had the greatest Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that ever any Church had, since the National Church of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> the greatest light, the greatest effects of matchless magnified
Love, the greatest Convictions of Sin, the greatest Resolutions and
Solemn Engagements against it, and the greatest Reformation from it,
that ever any had to abuse and affront: O Heavens! Be Astonished at
this, and Horribly afraid! For <hi>Scotland</hi> hath changed her Glory, and
the Crown hath faln from off her Head, by an unparallelled Apostacy,
a free and voluntary, wilful and deliberate Apostacy, an avowed and
declared and authorized Apostacy, a most universal and every way
unprecedented Apostacy.</p>
            <p>These Enemies of God, having once got footing again, with the
favour and fawnings of the Foolish Nation, went on fervently to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and promote their foolish Design: And meeting with no opposition
at first did encourage themselves to begin boldly. Wherefore, hearing
of some Ministers peaceably Assembled, to draw up a Monitory Letter
to the King, minding him of his Covenant, Engagements and Promises
(which was tho' weak, yet the first Witness and Warning against that
Heaven-daring Wickedness then begun) they Cruelly incarcerate them;
Having hereby much daunted the Ministry from their Duty in that day,
for fear of the like unusual and outragious usage.</p>
            <p>The Parliament convenes <hi>Ian.</hi> 1. 1661. without so much as a Protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Religion and Liberty given in to them. And there, in the
first place, they frame and take the Oath of Supremacy, Examtorating
Christ, and investing his usurping Enemy with the spoils of his rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
Prerogative, acknowledging the King <hi>only Supreme Governour over
all Persons and in all Causes, and that his Power and Iurisdiction must not

were encouraged to witness against their Ministers. By which means
(tho' many were in no hazard, thinking it commendable Prudence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended

to be silent at such a time) some faithful Ministers giving faithful and

of Treason, and Banished out of the three Dominions. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were Sentenced with Banishment, and furder were compelled to

When they had gained this Bulwark of Christs Kingdom, then they
waxed more insolent, and set up their Ensigns for Signs, and broke
down the Carved Work of Reformation with Axes and Hammers.
In this Parliament 1661. they pass'd an Act <hi>Rescissory,</hi> whereby they
annulled and declared void the National Covenant, the Solemn League
and Covenant, Presbyterial Government, and all Laws made in favour
of the work of Reformation, since the Year 1638. O horrid Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness!
To condemn and rescind what God did so signally Seal as his
own Work, to the Conviction of the World. But O Holy and
Astonishing Justice, thus to Recompence our way upon our own Head!
to suffer this work and cause to be ruined under our unhappy hands,
who suffered this Destroyer to come in before it was so effectually se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
as it should not have been in the power of his hand (whatever
had been in his Heart, swelled with enmity against Christ) to have raised
and ruined that work as now he most wickedly did, and drew so many
in to the Guilt of the same deed, that almost the whole Land not only
consented unto it, but Applauded it; by approving and countenancing
another wicked Act framed at the same time, by that same per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idious
Parliament, for an Anniversary Thanksgiving, commemorating every
29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> that Blasphemy against the Spirit and Work of God;
and celebrating tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> unhappy Restauration of the Rescinder of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
which had not only the Concurrence of the Universality
of the Nation, but (alas for shame that it should be told in <hi>Gath, &amp;c.)</hi>
even of some Ministers, who afterwards accepted the Indulgence (one
of which, a Pillar among them, was seen scandalously dancing about the
Bonfires.) And others, who should have allarmed the whole Nation
<hi>Quasi pro Aris &amp; Focis,</hi> to rise for Religion and Liberty, to resist such
Wickedness, did wink at it.</p>
            <p>Yet albeit, neither in this day, when the Covenant was not only
broken, but Cassed and declared of no Obligation, nor afterward when
it was Burnt (for which <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> would have been ashamed,
and afraid at such a terrible sight, and for which the Lords Anger is
burning against these bold Burners, and against them who suffered it,
and did not witness against it) was there any publick Testimony by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,
or Remonstrance, or any publick Witness? Tho' the Lord
had some then, and some who came out afterwards with the Trumpet
at their Mouth, whose Heart then sorrowed at the sight: And some
suffered for the Sense they shewed of that Anniversary Abomination,
for not keeping which they lost both Church and Liberty.</p>
            <p>It's true, the ordinary Meetings of Presbyteries and Synods were
about that time discharged, to make way for the Exercise of the new
power conferred on the four Prelates who were at Court. But this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59361:15"/>
could not give a discharge from a necessary Testimony, then called
from faithful Watchmen. However the Reformation being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded
and razed, and the House of the Lord pulled down, then they
begin to build their Bable.</p>
            <p>In the Parliament <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. by their first Act they restore and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish
Prelacy, upon such a Foundation as they might by the same Law
bring in Popery; and setled its Harbinger, Diocesan and Erastian Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy,
by fuller enlargement of the Supremacy, The very Act begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thus: <hi>Forasmuch as the ordering and disposal of the external Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, doth properly belong to his Majesty as an inherent Right
of the Crown, by Virtue of his Royal Prerogative and Supremacy in Causes
Ecclesiastick, whatever shall be determined by his Majesty with advice of
the Archbishops, and such of the Clergy as he shall nominate, in the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Government of the Church (the same consisting with the standing Laws
of the Kingdom) shall be valid and effectual.</hi> And in the same Act all
Laws are rescinded, by which the sole Power and Jurisdiction within
the Church doth stand in the Church-Assemblies, and all which may
be interpreted, to have given any Church-power, Jurisdiction or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
to the Office-Bearers of the Church, other than that which
acknowledgeth a dependence upon, and Subordination to the Soveraign
Power of the King as Supream. By which Prelates are redintegrated
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o all their Priviledges and Preheminences that they possessed <hi>Anno</hi> 1687.
And all their Church-Power (robbed from the Officers of Christ) is
made to be derived from, to depend upon, and to be Subordinate to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Crown-Prerogative of the King: Whereby the King is made the
only Fountain of Church-Power, and that exclusive even of Christ,
of whom there is no mentioned Exception: And his Vassals the Bishops,
as his Clerks in Ecclesiasticks, are accountable to him for all their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations;
a greater Usurpation upon the Kingdom of Christ, than
ever the Papacy it self aspired unto.</p>
            <p>Yet, albeit here was another display of a Banner of defiance against
Christ, in altering the Church-Government of Christs Institution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the humane Invention of Lordly Prelacy, there was no publick,
Ministerial, at least united Testimony against this neither. Therefore
the Lord punished this sinful and shameful silence of Ministers; when
by another wicked Act of the Council at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> above 300 Ministers
were put from their Charges; and afterwards for their Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in not countenancing their Diocesan Meeting, and not keeping
the Anniversary Day, <hi>May</hi> 29. the rest were violen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly thrust from their
Labours in the Lords Vineyard, and Banished from their Parishes, and
adjudged unto a strange and nice Confinement, twenty Miles from their
own Parishes, six Miles from a Cathedral Church, as they called it,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59361:15"/>
and three Miles from a Burgh. Yet in this fatal Convulsion of the
Church, generally all were struck with Blindness and Baseness, that
a Paper-Proclamation made them all run from their Posts, and obey
the Kings Orders for their ejection. Thus were they given up, because
of their forbearing to sound an Allarm, charging the People of God,
in point of Loyalty to Christ, and under the pain of the Curse of the
Covenant, to awake and acquit themselves like Men, and not to suffer
the Enemy to rob them of that Treasure of Reformation, which they
were put in possession of, by the Tears, Prayers, and Blood of such
as went before them; instead of those prudential fumblings, and
fistlings then and since so much followed. Wherefore the Lord in his
Holy Righteousness, left that Enemy to cast them out of the House
of the Lord, and dissolve their Assemblies, and deprive them of their
Priviledges, because of their not being so valiant for the Truth, as
that a full and faithful Testimony against that Encroachment might be
found upon Record.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless some were found faithful in that Hour and Power of
Darkness, who kept the Word of the Lords Patience, and who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were kept in and from Tentation (which carried away many into
sad and shameful Defections) tho' not from suffering hard things from
the hands of Men; and only these who felt most of their violence,
found Grace helping them to acquit themselves suitably to that days
Testimony, being thereby prevented from an active yeilding to their
impositions, when they were made passively to suffer force. However
that season of a publick Testimony was lost, and as to the most part
never recovered to this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Prelates being setled, and readmitted to voice in Parliament,
they procure an Act, Dogmatically condemning several Material parts
and points of our Covenanted Reformation, to wit, these Positions,</hi>
That it was Lawful for Subjects, for Reformation or necessary self-defence,
to enter into Leagues, or take up Arms against the King: And particularly
declaring that the National Covenant, as explained in the Year 1688. and
the solemn League and Covenant, were and are in themselves unlawful Oaths,
and were taken by, and imposed upon the Subjects of this Kingdom, against
the Fundamental Laws and Liberties thereof; That all such Gatherings and
Petitions, that were used in the beginning of the late Troubles, were unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and seditious: And whereas People were then led into these things, by
having disseminated among them such Principles as these, That it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for People to come with Petitions and Representations to the King, That
it was lawful for People to restrict their Allegiance under such and such
Limitations, and suspend it until he should give security for Religion, &amp;c.
It was therefore enacted, that all such Positions and Practices founded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59361:16"/>
were Treasonable—And furder did enact, that no Person, by Writing,
Praying, Preaching, or malicious or advised speaking, express or publish any
Words or Sentences, to stir up the People to the dislike of the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Supremacy, or of the Government of the Church by Bishops, or
justifie any of the Deeds, Actings or things declared against by that Act.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithstanding of all this Subversion of Religion and Liberty,
and restraint of asserting these Truths here trampled upon, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Men by Testimony, or before God in Mourning over these Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
done unto him, in everting these, and all the parts of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
even when it came to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Case of conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssion, Preaching and
Praying Truths interdicted by Law, few had their Eyes open (let be
their Windows in an open avouching them) to see the duty of the day
calling for a Testimony. Tho' afterwards the Lord spirited some to
assert and demonstrate the Glory of these Truths and Duties to the
World. As that judicious Author of the Apologetical Relation.</p>
            <p>But this is not all: For these Men, having now, as they thought, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the Work of God, they provided also against the fears of its
revival; making Acts, declaring, that if outed Ministers dare to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to Preach, and presume to exercise their Ministry, they should be
punished as Seditious Persons; requiring of all a due acknowledgment of,
and hearty complyance with the King's Government, Ecclesiastical and
Civil; and that whosoever shall ordinarily and wilfully withdraw and
absent from the ordinary Meetings for Divine Worship in their own
Churches, on the Lord's Day, shall incur the Penalties there inserted.
And thus none are allowed by Law to administer the Ordinances, but
either Apostate Curates, who by their Perjury and Apostatize for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulted
their Ministry, or other Hir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lings, and Prelates Journey-men, who
ran without a Mission, except from them who had none to give, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ording
to Christ's Institution, the Seal of whose Ministry could never
yet be shewn in the Conversion of any Sinner to Christ; but if the Tree
may be known by its Fruits, we may know whose Ministers they are; by
their Conversions of Reformation into Deformation; of the Work and
Cause of God, into the similitude of the <hi>Roman</hi> Beast; of Ministers into

               </gap>elings; of the Power of Godliness into Formality; of Preaching
Christ, into Orations of Morality; of the Purity of Christ's Ordinances,
into the vanity of Men's Inventions; of the Beautiful Government of the
House of God for Edification, to a Lordly Preeminence and Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
over Consciences: In a word, of Church and State, Constitutions
for Religion and Liberty, all upside down into Wickedness and Slavery.</p>
            <p>But now this astonishing Blow to the Gospel of the Kingdom, intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
such a swarm of Locusts into the Church, and in forcing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
of the People with this defection, and that so violently and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59361:16"/>
as even simple withdrawing was so severely punished by severe
Edicts of Fining, and other Arbitrary Punishments at first (for at first
they did not Imprison any for simple absenting themselves from the
Curates, and only imprisoned those who at any time shewed more than
ordinary Zeal against the Curate's Intrusion) what did it produce?
The generality of Ministers and Professors both went and Conformed
so far as to hear the Curates, contrary to many Points of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
formerly attained, contrary to their Covenant-Engagements,
and contrary to their own Principles and Practices at that same time;
scrupling and refusing to keep the Bishops <hi>Visitations,</hi> and to countenance
their <hi>Discipline</hi> and Power of <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> because it was required as a
Testification of their acknowledgment of, and Compliance with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Government; and yet not scrupling to Countenance their <hi>Doctrine,</hi>
and usurped Power of <hi>Order,</hi> required also by the same Law, as the same
Test of the same compliance and submission. Other Ministers lay alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by in their retired recesses, waiting to see what things would
turn to; others were hopeless, turned Farmers, and Doctors; others
wylie staid at home, and Preached quietly in <hi>Ladies Chambers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Faithful found themselves under an indispensable necessity to
Preach the Gospel, and witness for the freedom of their Ministry, and
make full proof of it, in Preaching in Season, and out of Season; and
thereupon as occasion offered, Preached to all such as were willing to
hear; but at first, only in private <hi>Houses,</hi> and that for the most part,
at such times when Sermons in publick surceased (a Superplus of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.)
But afterwards, finding so great Difficulties and Persecutions
for their House-Meetings, where they were so easily at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rapped, were
constrained at last to keep their Meetings in the <hi>Fields:</hi> Where testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying

on their Master's Prerogatives, and witnessing for their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

freedom, contrary to all Law-Interdictions, without any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censes
or Indulgence from the Usurper, but holding their Ministry from
Jesus Christ alone, both as to the Office and Exercise thereof; they had
so much of their Master's Countenance, and success in their Labours,
that they valued neither hazards or hardships, neither the contempt of
pretended Friends, nor the Laws nor threatnings of Enemies, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elacy, to advance ane absolute Supremacy, the King proceeds in his
Design, to pervert and evert the well modelled and moderated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of the <hi>State-Government</hi> also, by introducing and advancing ane

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bitrary Tyranny. For effectuating which, he first procures a lasting
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59361:17"/>
Imposition of intollerable Subsidies and Taxations; next a further
recognisance of his Prerogative, in a Subjection of Persons, Fortunes,
and whole strength of the Kingdom to his absolute Arbitriment, in a
Levy of Militia of 20000 Footmen, and 2000 Horsemen, sufficiently
armed, with Forty days Provision, to be ready upon the King's call to
march to any part of his Dominions, for opposing whatsoever Invasion,
or Insurrection, or for any other Service. The first sproutings of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
were cherished, by the cheerful and stupid Submission generally
yeilded to these Exorbitancies; so that generally People did not so
much as scruple sending out, or going out as Militia-men.</p>
            <p>After the fundamental Constitutions of both Church and State are
thus razed and rooted up, he contrived to frame all Inferior Magistrates
according to his Mould: And for this end appointed, that all Persons
in any Publick Trust or Office whatsoever, should subscribe a <hi>Declaration,</hi>
renouncing and abjuring the Covenant. But finding this not yet sufficient
security for this unsettled Settlement; because he well understood, the
People stood no ways obliged to acknowledge him, but only according
to the Solemn Covenants, being the fundamental Conditions whereupon
their Allegiance was founded; and well knowing, that he and his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociates,
by violating these Conditions, had loosed the People from all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to him, or deriving any Power from him, whereby the People might
justly plead, That since he had kept no Condition, they were not now
obliged to him; he therefore contriv'd a new Oath of Allegiance to be
impos'd upon all in publick Trust, both in Church and State. Strange!
can Presbyterians swear that Allegiance, which is substitute in the place
of the broken and burnt Covenant? Or could they swear it to such a
Person, who having buried the Covenant, that he might have another
Right and another Allegiance than that of the Covenant, had then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to us all Allegiance founded upon the Covenant?</p>
            <p>However, having prepared and furnished himself with Tools so
qualified for his purpose, in Church and State, he prosecutes his Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
with such fervor and fury, that at length, in the Year 1666, a
small Party were compelled to go to defensive Arms; which was occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
thus. Sir <hi>Iames Turner</hi> pursuing his Cruel Orders in <hi>Galloway,</hi> sent
some Souldiers to apprehend a poor old Man; whom his Neighbours
Compassionating, intreated the Souldiers to loose him as he lay bound;
but were answered with drawn Swords, and necessitated to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:
In which they relieve the Man, and disarm the Souldiers; and
further attacked some others oppressing that Country, disarming Ten
or Twelve more, and killing one that made resistance. Whereupon the
Country being allarm'd, and fearing Sir <hi>Iames</hi> would certainly avenge
this Affront upon the whole Country, without distinction of Free and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59361:17"/>
Unfree, they gather about Fifty four Horsemen, march to <hi>Dumfre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
take Sir <hi>Iames Turner</hi> Prisoner, and disarm the Souldiers, without any
more violence. Being thus by Providence engag'd, without any hope
of retreat, and getting some Concurrence of their Brethren in the same
condition, they come to <hi>Lanerk,</hi> where they renew the Covenant; and
thence to <hi>Pentland-Hills,</hi> where, by the Holy disposal of God, they were
routed, many killed, and 130 taken Prisoners, of which 35 were
afterwards hanged, who had much of the Lords Presence at their
deaths, and assurance of his Love, strengthening them to Seal a noble
Testimony. After this conflict many were forefaulted of their Estates,
and Intercommuned; Souldiers are permitted to take free Quarter in
the Country; to Examine Men by Tortures; to strip them who did so
much as resist the Fugitives, and thrust them into Prisons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence
we may see the Righteousness of God, how justly at that time he left
us in such a damp, that like Asses we couched under all Burdens, and
few came out to the help of the Lord against the Mighty, drawing on
them <hi>Meroz</hi>'s Curse, and the Blood of their butchered Brethren.</p>
            <p>But the King having now brought his only opposites, the few Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Witnesses of Christ, to a low pass, he went on by Craft as well as
Cruelty, to advance his own in promoting Antichrist's Interest. And
therefore having gotten the <hi>Supremacy</hi> devolved upon him by Law, he
would now exert that usurped Power, and work by insnaring Policy
to effe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tuate the End which he could not do by other means. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seeing he was not able to suppress the Meetings of the Lord's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for Gospel-Ordinances, in Houses and Fields, but that the more he
laboured by violent courses, the greater and more frequent they grew;
h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> fell upon a more crafty Device, not only to overthrow the Gospel,
and suppress the Meetings, but to break the Faithful, and to <hi>divide</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Mad-cap</hi> and the <hi>Moderate Fanaticks</hi> (as they phrased it) that
he might the more easily destroy both, to confirm the Usurpation, and
to settle People in a sinful silence, and stupid submission to all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
made on Christ's Prerogatives, and more effectually to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
what remained of the work of God. And knowing that nothing
could more fortifie the Supremacy than Ministers their homologating
and acknowledging it: Therefore he offered the first Indulgence <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
1669,</hi> signifying in a Letter, dated that Year <hi>Iune</hi> 7. His gracious
Pleasure was, <hi>To appoint so many of the outed Ministers, as have lived
peaceably and orderly, to return to Preach and exercise other Functions of
the Ministry, in the Parish-Churches where they formerly served (provided
they be vacant) to allow Patrons to present to other vacant Churches, such
others of them as the Council should approve: That all who are so indulged,
be enjoyned to keep Presbyteries, and the Refusers to be confined within the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59361:18"/>
bounds of their Parishes; and that they be enjoyned not to admit any of their
neighbour Parishes unto their Communions, nor Baptize their Children, nor
marry any of them, without the allowance of the Minister of the Parish; and if
they Countenance the People deserting their own Parishes, they are to be silenced
for shorter and longer time, or altogether turned out, as the Council shall see cause<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
And upon complaint made and verified, of any Seditious Discourse, or Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the Pulpit, uttered by any of the Ministers, they are immediately to be
turned out, and further punished according to Law: And seeing by these Orders,
all pretences for Conventicles were taken away; if any should be found hereafter
to preach without Authority, or keep Conventicles, His Pleasure is, to proceed
with all severity against them, as Seditious Persons, and Contemners of Auhtority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To salve this in point of Law, and to make the Kings Letter the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme

Council might proceed, and enact, and execute what the King pleased
in matters Ecclesiastick; He therefore caused frame a formal Statutory
Act of Supremacy of this Tenor, <hi>That his Majesty hath the Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Supremacy over all Persons and in all Causes Ecclesiastick, within
his Dominions; and that by vertue thereof, the ordering and disposal of the
External Government of the Church did properly belong to him and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
as an inherent right to the Crown; and that he may Settle, Enact, and
Emit such Constitutions, Acts and Orders, concerning the Administrating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and Persons employed in the same, and concerning all Ecclesiastical Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Matters, to be proposed and determined therein, as He in His Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Wisdom shall think fit; which Acts, Orders, and Constitutions, are to
be observed and obeyed by all His Majesties Subjects, any Law, Act, or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom

in their Act <hi>Iuly</hi> 27. 1669, do nominate several Ministers, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
them to Preach, and exercise the other Functions of the Ministry,

In the mean time, tho cruel Acts and Edicts were made against the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Lord's People, in Houses and the Fields, after all these Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitish
Wiles to suppress them; such was the Presence of the Lord in these
Meetings, and so powerful was his Countenance and Concurrence with
the Labours of a few, who laid out themselves to hold up the Standard
of Christ, that the number of Converts multiplied daily, to the great
encouragement of the few Hands that wrestled in that work, through
all humane discouragement. Therefore King and Council was put to a
new shift, which they supposed would prove more effectual; to wit, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there was a great number of Nonconformed Ministers not yet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged,
who either did or might hereafter hold Conventicles, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to remede or prevent this in time coming, they appoint and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
them to such places where Indulged Ministers were settled, there
to be confined with Allowance, to Preach as the Indulged should employ
them; thinking by this means to incapacitate many to hold Meetings
there or elsewhere: And to these also they give Injunctions and Restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to regulate them in the exercise of their Ministry. And to the
end that all the outed Ministers might be brought under restraint, and the
Word of God be kept under Bonds, by another Act of Council they
Command, that all other Ministers (not disposed of as is said) were either
to repair to the Parish-Church where they were, or to some other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
where they may be ordinary hearers, and to declare and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
upon the Parishes, where they intend to have their Residence. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this they assumed a Power, to dispose of these their Curates as they
pleased, and transport them from place to place; whereof the only
ground was a simple Act of Council, the Instructions always going along
with them, as the constant companion of the Indulgence: By all which
it is apparent, whatever these Ministers Alledge, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was but
the <hi>removal of the Civil Restraint,</hi> and that they entred into their places
by the <hi>Call of the People</hi> (a meer mock-pretence for a prelimited Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
whereby that Ordinance of Christ was basely prostituted and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused)
and that their <hi>Testimony and Protestation</hi> was a <hi>Salvo</hi> for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
(a meer Utopian fancy, that the Indulgers with whom they
bargained, never heard of, otherwise, as they did with some who were
faithful in notifying against their Encroachments, they would soon have
given them a Bill of ease.) It cannot be denied, that that doleful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
both in its Rise, Contrivance, Conveyance, Grant and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
End and Effects, was a grievous Encroachment upon the
Princely Prer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gative of Jesus Christ, the only Head of the Church;
whereby the Usurpers Supremacy was Homologated, bowed to, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with, strengthened the Cause and Kingdom of Christ betrayed,
his Churches Privileges Surrendred, his Enemies hardened, his Friends
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59361:19"/>
stumbled, and the Remnant rent and ruined. And yet a great part of
the Ministers took that Indulgence; and another part, did, instead of
Remonstrating the Wickedness of that deed, Palliate, and Plaister, and
Patronize it, in keeping up the Credit of the King and Councils <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet the Lord had some Witnesses, who pretty early did give significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of their Resentment of this dishonour done to Christ; as Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er,</hi> who having got the Legal Call of the People, and discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Duty honestly, was turned out: And Mr. <hi>Iohn Burnet,</hi> who wrote
a Testimony directed to the Council, shewing why he could not submit
to that Indulgence, inserted at large in the History of Indulgence;
where also we have the Testimony of other Ten Ministers, who drew
up their Reasons of Non-complyance with such a Snare: And Mr. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex.
Blaire,</hi> who, upon occasion of Citation before the Council for not
observing the 29<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> told the Council, <hi>That he could receive no
Instructions from them in the Exercise of his Ministry, otherwise he should not
be Christ's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ambassador, but theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But afterwards the Lord raised up some more explicit Witnesses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that defection. While the King thought he had by that Device
utterly suppressed the Gospel in House and Field-Meetings, he was so
far disappointed, that these very Means and Machins, by which he
thought to bury it, did chiefly contribute to its revival: For, when
by Persecution, many Ministers had been chased away by illegal Law-Sentences,
many had been banished away, and by their ensnaring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences
many had been drawn away from their Duty, and others were
now Sentenced with Confinements and Restraints, if they should not
choose and fix their Residence where they could not keep their Christ
and Conscience both; they were forced to wander and disperse through
the Country; by whose Endeavours the Word of God grew exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and went at least through the Southern Borders of the Kingdom,
like Lightning. O! who can remember the Glory of that day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a melting Heart? A day of such Power, that it made the People
willing to come out and venture upon the greatest of hardships, and the
greatest of hazards, in pursuing after the Gospel; even when they
could not have a probable expectation of escaping the Sword of the
Wilderness, and the barbarous fury of bloody Burrio's raging for their
Prey, sent out with Orders to take and kill them, it being now made
Criminal by Law, especially to the Preachers and Convocaters of these
Meetings. I will make bold to say, I doubt if ever there were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
days of the Son of Man upon the Earth since the Apostolick times,
than we enjoyed for the space of Seven Years at that time.</p>
            <p>Now when Christ is gaining ground by the Preached Gospel in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59361:19"/>
Plenty, Purity and Power, the Usurpers Supremacy was like to stagger,
and Prelacy came under contempt. Hence, to secure what he had pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
himself of by Law, and to prevent a dangerous Paroxism which he
thought would ensue upon these Commotions, the King returned to exert
his innate Tyranny, and to emit terrible Orders, and more terrible Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners,
and bloody Emissaries against all Field-Meetings; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
long Patience, the People at length could not endure; but being first
chased to the Fields, where they would have been content to have the
Gospel, with all the Inconveniencies of it; and also expelled from the
Fields, being resolute to maintain the Gospel, they resolved to defend
it and themselves by Arms: To which, unavoidable necessity in unsup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
extremity did constrain them, as the only remaining Remedy.
It is known, for several Years they met without any Arms, where fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they were disturbed and dispersed with Souldiers; some killed,
others wounded, which they patiently endured withou Resistance: At
length, the Ministers that were most in hazard, having a Price set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Heads to be brought in dead or alive, with some attending
them in their wandrings, understanding they were thus appointed for
death, judged it their duty to provide for the necessary defence of their
Lives, from the Violence of their armed Assaulters. And as Meetings
encreased, divers others came under the same hazard, which enforced
them to endeavour the same Remedy, without the least intention of
of prejudice to any. Thus the number of Sufferers increasing, as they
joyned in the Ordinances at these persecuted Meetings, found themselves
in some probable capacity to defend themselves, and these much endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Gospel-Priviledges, and to preserve the Memory of the Lord's
great Work in the Land, which to transmit to Posterity was their great
design. Wherefore in these Circumstances, being redacted to that
strait, either to be deprived of the Gospel, or to defend themselves in
their Meetings for it; and thinking their turning their Backs upon it
for hazard, was a cowardly deserting duty, and palpable breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-Engagements,
abandoning their greatest Interest, they thought
it expedient, yea, necessary, to carry defensive Arms with them; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an indissoluble obligation in their Covenants, to maintain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the true Religion and one another in promoting the same. And
hereunto they were encouraged by the constant experience of the Lord's
countenancing their Endeavours in that posture, which always proved
successful for several Years, their Enemies either turning their backs
without disturbance when they observed them resolve Defence, or in
their Assaultings repulsed; so that there was never a Meeting, which
stood to their Defence, got any considerable harm thereby. Thus the
Lord was with us while we were with him; but when we forsook him,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59361:20"/>
he forsook us, and left us in the hands of our Enemies. However, while
Meetings for Gospel-Ordinances did continue, the Wicked Rulers did
not cease from time to time to encrease their numerous Bands of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Souldiers, for suppressing the Gospel in these Field-meetings.</p>
            <p>But all this is nothing to what followed; when, thinking these Blood-Hounds
were too favourable, they brought down from the wild High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
a Host of Salvages upon the Western Shires, more terrible than
<hi>Turks,</hi> or <hi>Tartars;</hi> Men who feared not God, nor regarded Man; to
wast and destroy a plentiful Country, which they resolved before they
left it, to make as bare as their own. This Hellish Crew was adduced
to work a Reformation, like the <hi>French</hi> Conversions, to press a <hi>Bond of
Conformity,</hi> wherein every one Subscribed, was bound for himself, and
all under him, Wife, Children, Servants, Tenants, to frequent their
Parish Churches, and never to go to these Meetings, nor reset nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
any that went, but to Inform against, Pursue, and Deliver up
all <hi>vagrant Preachers,</hi> as they called them, to Tryal, and Judgment.</p>
            <p>Then for the maintenance of the Souldiers, there were imposed new,
wicked, and arbitrary Cesses and Taxations, professedly required for
suppressing Religion and Liberty, banishing the Gospel out of the Land,
and preserving and promoting the King's Absoluteness over all Matters
and Persons Sacred and Civil; which, under that tentation of great
Sufferings threatned to Refusers, and under the disadvantage of the
silence and unfaithfulness of many Ministers, who either did not condemn
it, or pleaded for the peaceable payment of it; many did comply with it
then, and far more since.</p>
            <p>Yet at that time there were far more Recusants in some places (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the Western shires) than Complyers: And there were many
of the Ministers that did faithfully declare to the People the Sin of it;
not only from the <hi>illegality</hi> of its Imposition, by a Convention of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed
and prelimited States; but from the <hi>nature</hi> of that imposed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
that it was a sinful Transaction with Christ's declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
a strengthning the hands of the wicked, an obedience to a wicked
Law, a consenting to Christ's expulsion out of the Land; and not only
that, but (far worse than the Sin of the <hi>Gadarens)</hi> a formal Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to assist his Expellers, by maintaining their force, a hiring
our Oppressors to destroy Religion and Liberty; and from the declared
<hi>end</hi> of it, expressed in the very Narrative of the Act, <hi>viz. To Levy
and Maintain Forces for suppressing and dispersing Meetings</hi> of the Lord's
People, and to shew unanimous affections for maintaining the King's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
as now Established by Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Yet all this time Ministers and Professors were unite, and with one
Soul and Shoulder followed the work of the Lord, 'till the Indulged
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59361:20"/>
being dissatisfied with the Meetings in the Fields, whose Glory was like
to over-cloud and obscure their Beds of ease; and especially, being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at the freedom and faithfulness of some, who set the Trumpet
to their Mouth, and shewed <hi>Iacob</hi> his Sins, and <hi>Israel</hi> his Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,
impartially, without Cloak, or Cover, they began to
make a <hi>Faction</hi> among the Ministers, and to devise how to quench the
fervour of their Zeal, who were faithful for God. But the more they
sought to extinguish it, the more it brake out, and blazed into a flame.
For several of Christ's Ambassadours, touched and affected with the
affronts done to their Princely Master by the Supremacy, and the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of its Bastard-Brood and Brat, began after long silence to discover
its iniquity, and to acquaint the People how the Usurper had inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Mediator's Chair, in taking upon him to Depose, Suspend,
Silence, Plant, and Transplant his Ministers, where, and when, and
how he pleased, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet others, and the greater number of Dissenting Ministers, were
not only deficient herein, but defended them, joyned with them, and
(pretending Prudence, and prevention of Schism) in effect homologa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that deed, and the Practice of these Priests, <hi>Ezek</hi> 22. 26. teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and advising the People to hear them, both by Precept, and going
along with them in their <hi>Erastian</hi> Course: And not only so, but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
and Censured such who Preached against the sinfulness thereof;
especially in the first place, worthy Mr. <hi>Walwood,</hi> who was among the
first Witnesses against that Defection, and Mr. <hi>Kid,</hi> Mr. <hi>King,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Cameron,</hi> Mr. <hi>Donald Cargil, &amp;c.</hi> who Sealed their Testimony after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by their blood; yet then, even by their Brethren, were loaden
with the reproachful Nick-names of Schismaticks, Blind Zealots, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it was always observed, as long as Ministers were
faithful in following the Lord in the way of their Duty, Professors
were fervent, and under all their Conflicts with Persecutors, the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and Zeal of the Lovers of Christ was blazing, and never outbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by all the Enemies boastings, to undertake brisk Exploits, which
from time to time they were now and then essaying, 'till defection de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
and division diverted their Zeal against the Enemies of God,
who before were always the Object against which they whetted the
edge of their jus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and attempted to cut him off; which failing, he then escaped,

But Justice would not suffer the Arch-Prelate to escape Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable

            <p>On the Sabbath following, <hi>Iune</hi> 1. A Field-Meeting near to <hi>Lowden-Hill,</hi>
was assaulted by <hi>Claverhouse,</hi> and with him three Troops of Horse
and Dragoons, who had that Morning taken an honest Minster, and
about 14 Countrymen out of their Beds, and carried them along with
them; but they were repulsed at <hi>Drumclogg,</hi> and put to flight, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
relieved, about 30 of the Souldiers killed on the place, and
three of the Meeting, and several wounded on both sides.</p>
            <p>Thereafter the People retreating from the pursuit, they judged it
most safe in that extremity for some time not to separate. Which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
coming abroad to the Ears of others of their Brethren, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
them incontinently to come to their assistance, considering their

               </gap>ing of the same
judgment for maintaining of the same Cause, to which they were bound
by the same Covenants. This was the Rise and Occasion of that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
at <hi>Bothwel-Bridge,</hi> which the Lord did in his Holy Soveraignty
confound, for former Defections by the means of Division, which broke
that little Army among themselves, before they were broken by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.
They continued together in amiable and amicable Peace, for the
space of 8 or 9 days, while they endeavoured to put out and keep out
every wicked thing from amongst them, and adhered to the <hi>Rutherglen Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,</hi>
and that short <hi>Declaration</hi> at <hi>Glascow</hi> confirming it; <hi>Representing
their present Purposes and Endeavours were only in vindication and defence
of the Reformed Religion, as they stood obliged thereto by the National and
Solemn League and Covenant, and the Solemn Acknowledgment of Sins, and
Engagement to Duties, declaring against Popery, Prelacy, Erastianism, and
all things depending thereupon.</hi> Intending hereby to comprehend the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the Indulgence, to witness against which all unanimously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed:
Until the Army encreasing, the Defenders and Daubers of that
Defection, some Ministers and others came in, who broke all. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59361:21"/>
of the Breach, was first, when an Overture was offered, to set
times apart for Humiliation for the Publick Sins of the Land; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
the complying with abjured <hi>Erastianism,</hi> by the acceptance of
the ensnaring Indulgence, was condescended upon among the rest of the
grounds of Fasting and Humiliation: The Sticklers for the Indulgence
refused the Overture, upon Politick Considerations, for fear of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Indulged Ministers and Gentlemen, and provoking them to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
their Assistance. And next; whereas the Cause was stated before,
according to the Covenants, in the <hi>Rutherglen Testimony,</hi> and <hi>Glascow
Declaration,</hi> wherein the <hi>King's Interest</hi> was waved; These Dividers
drew up another large Paper (called the <hi>Hamiltown Declaration)</hi>
wherein they assert the <hi>Kings Interest,</hi> according to <hi>the Third Article</hi>
of the Solemn League and Covenant. Against which, the best affected
contended, and protested they could not in Conscience put in his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
into the state of the quarrel, being now in stated opposition to
Christ's Interests, and inconsistent with the meaning of the Covenant,
and the Practices of the Covenanters, and their own Testimonies; while
now he could not be declared for, as being in the defence of Religion
and Liberty, when he had so palpably overturned and ruined the work
of Reformation, and oppressed such as adhered thereunto, and had
burnt the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereby he had loosed the People from all
obligation to him from it. Yet that contrary Faction prevailed, so far
as to get it published in the name of all, whereby the Cause was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and betrayed. And so in the Holy All-over-ruling Providence
of God, that poor handful was signally discountenanced of God, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of all Conduct, divested of all Protection, and laid open to the
Raging Sword, the just punishment of all such tamperings with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of God, and espousing their Interest. About 300 were killed
in the Fields, and 1000 and upwards taken Prisoners, stripped, and
carried to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and there sentenced with Banishment, and sent away
for <hi>America,</hi> and by the way (a few excepted) perished in Shipwreck;
and two faithful and painful Ministers and Witnesses of Christ, Mr.
<hi>Iohn Kidd,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iohn King,</hi> received the Crown of Martyrdom,
sealing their Testimony with their Blood, and many others after them
for the same Cause.</p>
            <p>After this fearful and fatal stroak at <hi>Bothwell,</hi> the Universality of the
Children of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which before espoused her Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
was partly drawn by Craft, and partly by Cruelty, from a
Conjunction with their Brethren in prosecuting the same, either into an
open defection to the contrary side, or into a detestable indifferency
and neutrality in the Cause of God. For first of all, the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
procured the emission of a pretended Indemnity, attended with a
<hi>Bond of Peace</hi> for its Companion; wherein that Insurrection was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59361:22"/>
to be <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and ane Obligation <hi>never to rise in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King, or any Commissionate by him, and to live peaceably,</hi> &amp;c.
Which were dreadful Snars fairded over with curious words and cozening
names of <hi>living peaceably,</hi> &amp;c. This course of defection carried away
many at that time: And from that time, since the taking that Bond
of <hi>peaceable living,</hi> there hath been an Universal preferring of Peace to
Truth, and Ease to Duty. And the Generality have been left to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
all Oaths and Bonds imposed since; many Ministers refusing to give
their advice when required and requested thereunto, and some not being
ashamed to perswade the People to take them.</p>
            <p>But then they not only raised more Forces to exhaust the strength and
substance of the already wasted Country, and laid on and continued
from one Term to another that wicked Exaction and cruel Oppression
of the <hi>Cess,</hi> for the same declared ends of suppressing and banishing
what remained of the Gospel, and imposed Localites for maintaining
the Souldiers imployed in those Designs; for refusing which many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
were Pillaged, Plundered, and quite Impoverished, besides the
beating and abusing them: But also they went on unweariedly with
pressing the <hi>Bonds of Peace,</hi> and dragging them like Dogs to the Prisons
that would not subscribe them, and for taking up in their <hi>Porteous Rolls</hi>
the Names of all that were suspected to have been at <hi>Bothwell</hi> Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which they gathered by the Informations of Sycophants, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
them Convict, if being summoned they did not appear, and
forced others to Swear <hi>Super Inquirendis,</hi> and delate upon Oath whom
they did either see or heard that they were in Arms, or went to Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
and such as refused suffered Bonds of Banishment. Yea, having
made it Criminal to reset, harbour, correspond or converse with those
whom they declared Rebels, they thereupon imprisoned, fined, and
ruined vast numbers, for having seen or spoken with some of them, or
because they did not discover or apprehend them when they fancied they
might, for which many Gentlemen and others were Indicted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned,
and some Arraigned and Condemned to Death. For these
Causes, the Country was Harrassed and destroyed by four extraordinary
<hi>Circuit Courts,</hi> successively going about with their numerous Train,
whereby many were grievously oppressed, and with their Oppressions
tempted with many Impositions of Conscience-debauching Oaths, and
Bonds to compear when called, and to keep the Church, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain
from going to Meetings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by these tentations involved in
Complyances and Defections. And not only were they Condemned to
Death, for being actually in Arms, or any overt Act of Transgressing
their wicked Laws, but even for their extorted Opinion of things, or
because they would not Condemn these necessitated risings in Arms to
be Rebellion and a Sin against God, which they were forced to declare
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59361:22"/>
by terrible menacings of Death; making their Arbitrary Laws to reach
the Heart, Thoughts, and inward Sentiments of the Mind, as well as
outward Actions. Whereupon this became a Criminal Question rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
many of their Lives, <hi>Was the rising at</hi> Bothwell-bridge <hi>Rebellion
and a Sin against God?</hi> And this, <hi>Was the killing of the Bishop of St</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews
<hi>horrid Murther?</hi> Which if any answered negatively, or did not
answer affirmatively, they were cruelly Condemned to Death.</p>
            <p>The Ministry then also were generally insnared with that Bonded In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
the pretended benefit of that forementioned Indemnity. For,
when a Proclamation was emitted, inveighing bitterly against Field-Meetings,
and absolutely introducing all such for the future under
highest pain, but granting Liberty to Preach in Houses upon the Terms
of a <hi>Cautionany Bond</hi> given for their living peaceably: Yet excluding all
these Ministers who were suspected to have been at the late Rebellion,
and all those who shall afterwards be admitted by Non-Conform Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters:
And certifying, that <hi>if ever they shall be at any Field-Conventicle, the
said Indemnity shall not be useful to such Transgressours any manner of way:</hi>
And requiring security that none under the colour of this favour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to Preach Rebellion. Though there seems to be enough in the
Proclamation it self to have scared them from this scandalous snare;
Yet a Meeting of Ministers at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> made up of Indulged, avowed
Applauders of the Indulgence, or underhand Approvers and favourers
of the same, and some of them old <hi>Publick Resolutioners,</hi> assuming to
themselves the name of a <hi>General Assembly,</hi> voted for the acceptance of it.
And so formerly transacted and bargained upon base, dishonest and
dishonourable Terms with the Usurper, by consenting and compacting
with the People to give that Bond, wherein the People upon an humble
Petition to the Counsel, obtaining <hi>their Indulged Minister, do bind and
oblige that he shall live peaceably. And in order thereto to present him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Majesty's Privy Council, when they shall be called so to do; And in
case of failure in not presenting him, to be liable to the Sum of 6000 Merks.</hi>
Whereby they Condemned themselves of former unpeaceableness.</p>
            <p>Many embraced this new <hi>Bastard Indulgence</hi> that had not the benefit
of the former Brat, of the same Mother the Supremacy, and far more
consented to it without a Witness, and most of all did some way homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate
it, in Preaching under the Sconce of it: Declining the many
reiterated and urgent Calls of the zealous Lovers of Christ, to come
out and maintain the Testimony of the Gospel in the open Fields,
for the honour of their Master and the freedom of their Ministry.</p>
            <p>Whereupon, as many poor People were tumbled and jumbled into
many confusions, so that they were so bewildered and bemisted in
doubts and debates, that they knew not what to do, and were tempted
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59361:23"/>
to question the Cause formerly so fervently contended for against all
opposition, than so simply abandoned, by those that seemed sometimes
valiant for it, when they saw them consulting more their onw ease than
the Concerns of their Masters Glory, or the necessity of the poor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
Hungering for the Gospel; so the more zealous and faithful, after
several Addresses, Calls and Invitations to Ministers, finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
deserted by them, judged themselves under a necessity to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
many of them, whom formerly they followed with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and to resolve upon a persuit and prosecution of Duty of the
Day without them, and to provide themselves with faithful Ministers,
who would not shun for all hazards, to declare the whole Counsel of
God. And accordingly, the Lord sent them first Mr. <hi>Richard Cameron,</hi>
with whom after serious solicitation his Brethren denied their Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and then Mr. <hi>Donald Cargill,</hi> who, with a zeal and boldness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Christs Ambassadours, maintained and prosecuted the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
against all the Indignities done to their Master and wrongs to
the Cause, both by the encroachments of Adversaries, and Defections
of their declining Brethren. And now the Lords Inheritance was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
revived.</p>
            <p>But as Christ was then displaying his Beauty to his poor despised
and persecuted People; the Duke of <hi>York</hi> came to <hi>Scotland,</hi> who did
receive him in great Pomp and Pride. Against which, the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
faithful Witnesses of Christ did find themselves obliged to testifie
their just resentment, and to protest against his succeeding to the
Crown, in their Declaration published at <hi>Sanquhair, Iune</hi> 22. 1680.
Wherein also <hi>they disown</hi> Charles Stuart, <hi>as having any Right, Title, or
Interest in the Crown of</hi> Scotland <hi>or Government thereof, because of his breath
of Covenant, and Vsurpation on Christs Prerogatives,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And declare a
War with him, and all the Men of these Practices, homologating the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
at</hi> Rutherglen, <hi>and disclaiming that Declaration at</hi> Hamiltown.
This Action was generally Condemned by the Body of lurking Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
both for the matter of it, and the <hi>unseasonableness</hi> of it, and its
apparent unfeasiblness, being done by a handful so inconsiderable, for
number, strength, or significancy. But tho' it is not the prudence of
the management, but the justness of the Action, that I would have vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
from Obloquies; yet it wanted nothing but success to justifie
both, in the Conviction of many that made much outcry against it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In these dangerous Circumstances their difficulties and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
dayly encreased, by their Enemies vigilancy, their enviers Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
and their own inadvertency, some of their number falling into
the hands of them that sought their lives. For two of the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and faithful Witnesses of Christ, Mr.</hi> Donald Cargill, <hi>and</hi> Henry
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59361:23"/>
Hall, <hi>were surprized at</hi> Queens Ferrie. <hi>Mr.</hi> Cargill <hi>escaped at that
time, but the other endeavouring to resist the Enemies, was Murdered
by them. And with him they got a draught of a</hi> Covenant, <hi>declaring
their present purposes and future Resolutions. The Tenor whereof
was an Engagement,</hi> To free the Church of God of the Corruption of
Prelacy on the one hand, and the Thraldom of Erastianism on the other: To
persevere in the Doctrin of the Reformed Churches, especially that of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and in the Presbyterian Government, exercised in Sessions, Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Synods and General Assemblies, as a distinct Government from the
Civil, and distinctly to be exercised, not after a Carnal manner, by plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of Votes, or Authority of a single Person, but according to the word of
God making and carrying the sentence: To execute Righteous Iudgement im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially,
according to the Word, and degree of Offence, upon the Committers
of these things, especially, to wit, Blasphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oppression and Malignancy,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> To reject the present Rulers; as the only speedy way of relaxation from
the Wrath of God lying on the Land: Therefore easily solving the Objectious
(1.) of our Ancestors obliging the Nation to this Race and Line; that they
did not buy their Liberty with our Thraldom, nor could they bind their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to any thing so much to their prejudice: They could only bind to that
Government which they esteemed the best for common good, which reason ceas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we are free to chuse another, if we find it more conducible for that end.
(2) Of the Covenant binding to defend the King: That that Obligation is
only in his maintenance of the true Covenanted Religion; which Homage they
cannot now require upon the account of the Covenant, which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
and disclaimed; and upon no other ground we are bound to them, the
Crown not being an Inheritance, that passeth from Father to Son, without the
consent of Tenants. (3) Of the hope of returning from these Courses: That
suppose they should dissemble a repentance, yet the Land cannot be cleansed from
their Guiltness, but by executing Gods Righteous Iudgments upon them.
Vpon these accounts they reject that King, and those associate with him in the
Government, and declare them henceforth no lawful Rulers, as they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
them to be no lawful Subjects, they having destroyed the established Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
taken away Christs Church Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And declare they shall,
God giving power, set up Government and Governours according to the word
of God, and the qualifications required, <hi>Exod. 18. v.</hi> 20. And shall not commit
the Government to any single Person, or lineal succession. And moreover, that
these Men set over them shall be engaged to govern Principally, by that Civil
and judicial Law (not that which is any way typical) given by God to his People
of <hi>Israel,</hi> especially in matters of Life and Death, and other things, so far
as they reach, and are consistent with Christian Liberty, exempting Divorce
and Poligamy. And seeing that the greatest part of Ministers, not only were
defective in Preaching against the Acts of the Rulers for overthrowing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> they declare they neither can nor will hear them. They are for a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59361:24"/>
standing Gospel-Ministry, rightly chosen and rightly ordained, and that no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
shall take upon them the Preaching of the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unless called and ordained
thereunto. And whereas separation might be imputed to them, they refell both
the Malice, and the Ignorance of the Calumny: For if there be a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it must be where the change is; and that was not to be found in them,
who were not separating from the Communion of the true Church, not setting
up a new Ministry, but cleaving to the same Ministers and Ordinances, that
formerly they followed, when others have fled to new ways, and a new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
which is like the new piece in the Old Garment. And that they shall
defend themselves in their Civil, Natural and Divine Rights and Liberties;
And if any assault them, they shall took on it as a declaring a War, and
take all advantages that one Enemy does of another, but trouble and injure
none but those that injure them. <hi>This is the Compend of that Paper
which the Enemies seized and published, while it was only in a rude
Draught, and not polished, digested, nor consulted by the rest of the
Community.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That poor Party continued together in a posture of defence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Concurrence or countenance of their Covenanted Brethren,
until the 22<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1680. Upon the which day they were attacqued
at <hi>Airsemoss,</hi> by a strong party of about 120 Horse well armed, while
they were but 23 Horse and 40 foot at most: And so fighting valiantly,
were at length routed. Several of <hi>Sions</hi> precious Mourners, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Witnesses of Christ, were killed; and among the rest, that faithful
Minister of Christ, Mr. <hi>Richard Cameron</hi> sealed and fulfilled his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
with his Blood. And with others, the valiant and much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
Gentleman, <hi>David Hackston</hi> of <hi>Rathillet,</hi> was after many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Wounds apprehended, brought in to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and there, reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
adhering to the Testimony, and disowning the Authority of King
and Council, and all their Tyrannical Judicatories, head and tail, and
for being accessory to executing judgment upon the Arch-bishop of St.
<hi>Andrews,</hi> was tortured alive, with the cutting off of his hands, and
then Hanged, and before he was Dead, Ripped up his Heart, taken
our, carried about upon the point of a Knife, and thrown into a F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re,
and afterwards his Body Quartered.</p>
            <p>Then, not only such as were with that little handful at <hi>Airsemoss</hi>
were Cruelly Murdered, but others against whom they could charge
no matter of Fact, were questioned <hi>if they owned the Kings Authority;</hi>
which if any did not answer affirmatively and positively, he was to
look for nothing but exquisite Torments and Death. And if any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
their judgment, that they could not in Conscience own such
Authority as was then exercised; or if they declined to give their
thoughts of it, as judging thoughts to be under no humane Jurisdiction;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59361:24"/>
or if they answered with such innocent Specifications as these, that they
owned all Authority <hi>in the Lord,</hi> or <hi>for the Lord,</hi> or <hi>according to the
word of God,</hi> or all <hi>just</hi> and <hi>lawful</hi> Authority, these underwent and
suffered the Capital Punishment of Treason. And yet both declining
and declaring their extorted Answers about this, they were Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as unsufferable. Maintainers of Principles inconsistent with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>But chiefly they laboured to Murder the Soul, defile the Conscience,
and only consult to cast a Man down from his excellency, which is his
integrity; either by Hectoring or Flattering from the Testimony:
which they endeavoured by proposing many offers, with many threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
in subtile Terms; And pretending a great deal of tenderness,
protesting <hi>they would be as tender of their Blood as of their own Soul,</hi> and
purging themselves as <hi>Pilate</hi> did, and charging it upon their own Head.
They would be very easie in their Accomodations, where they found
the poor Man beginning to faint, and hearken to their overtures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they would grant him his life, yeilding to him, as cunning Anglers do
with Fishes: And to perswade him to some length in complying, they
would offer Conference sometimes, or reasoning upon the Point, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
and inform his Conscience, as they pretended, but really to catch
him with their busked Hook. If they had any hope of prevailing,
they would change a Mans Prison, and take him out from among the
more strict and fervent in the Cause, that might sharpen and strengthen
his Zeal, and put him among the more cool and remiss. Sometimes
they would stage several together, whereof they knew some would
Comply, to tantalize the rest with the sight of the others Liberty,
and make them bite the more eagerly at their Bait, to catch the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>But when they had done all they could, Christ had many Witnesses,
who did retain the Crown of their Testimony in the smallest points,
till they obtained the Crown of Martyrdom. But here, as in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
the more they were afflicted, the more they grew: So that many were
reclaimed from their Courses of Complyance, and others were daily
more and more confirmed in the ways of the Lord, and so strengthned
that they chose rather to endure all Torture, and embrace Death in its
most terrible aspect, than to give the Tyrant and his Complices any
acknowledgment: Yea, not so much as to say, <hi>God save the King,</hi> which
was offered at the price of their Life; but they would not accept Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
on these Terms.</p>
            <p>Now remained Mr. <hi>Donald Cargil,</hi> deprived of his faithful Collegue,
destitute of his Brethrens Concurrence; who prosecuted the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
against the Universal Apostasie of the Church and Nation,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59361:25"/>
Tyranny of Enemies, Backsliding of Friends, and all the wrongs done
to his Master on all hands: And considering, in the Zeal of God, and
Sense of his holy Jealousie provoked, and threatning Wrath against
the Land, for the Sins, especially of Rulers; that notwithstanding
of all their Testimonies given against them, by publick Preachings,
Protestations and Declarations, remonstrating their Tyranny, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning
their Authority; yet not only did they persist in their Sins and
Scandals, but were owned also by Professours, not only as Magistrates,
but as Members of the Christian and Protestant Church; and that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
both the Defensive Arms of Men had been used against them, and
the Christian Arms of Prayers, and the Ministerial Weapon of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet that of <hi>Ecclesiastical Censure</hi> had not been Authoritatively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted
against them: Therefore that no Weapon which Christ allows
his Servants under his Standard to manage against his Enemies might
be wanting, tho' he could not obtain the Concurrence of his Brethren
to strengthen the Solemnity and Formality of the Action; yet he did
not judge that Defect, in this broken Case of the Church, could disable
his Authority, nor demur the Duty, but that he might and ought to
proceed to <hi>Excommunication.</hi> And accordingly in <hi>Sept.</hi> 1680. at the
<hi>Torwood,</hi> he Excommunicated some of the most scandalous and principal
Promoters and Abettors of this Conspiracy against Christ, as formally
as the present Case could admit: After Sermon upon <hi>Ezek 21. 25,
26, 27. And thou profane wicked Prince of</hi> Israel, <hi>whose Day is come, &amp;c.</hi>
The Persons Excommunicated, and the Sentence against them, was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
forth as follows. <hi>I being a Minister of Iesus Christ, and having
Authority and Power from him, do, in his Name and by his Spirit, Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
cast out of the Church, and deliver up to Satan,</hi> Charles <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
King &amp;c.</hi> The Sentence was founded on these Grounds; <hi>For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
great Perjury in breaking and burning the Covenant; for his rescinding all
Laws; for establishing the Reformation, end enacting Laws contrary thereunto;
For commanding of Arms to destroy the Lords People; For his granting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
and Pardons for Murderers, which is in the power of no King to
do, &amp;c.</hi> Next by the same Authority, and in the same Name, he Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
James <hi>Duke of</hi> York, <hi>for his Idolatry, and setting up in</hi>
Scotland <hi>to defile the Land, and enticing and encouraging others to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
With several other rotten Malignant Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But about this time, when some in zeal for the Cause were endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to keep up the Testimony of the day, in an abstraction from
Complying Ministers; others were left to fall into fearful extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and delirious and damnable Delusions, being overdriven with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and blind Zeal into untroden Paths, which led them into a
Labyrinth of Darkness: When as they were stumbled at many Ministers
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59361:25"/>
their unfaithfulness, so they came to be offended at Mr <hi>Cargill</hi> his
Faithfulness, who spared neither left-hand Declensions, nor-right hand
Extreams, and left him and all the Ministers, not only disowning all
Communion with those that were not of their way, but Execrating and
Cursing them; and kept themselves in desart places from all Company,
where they persisted prodigiously in Fastings, and singing Psalms, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to wonderful Raptures and Enthusiasms: And in fine, <hi>Iohn Gib</hi>
with 4 more of them came to that height of Blasphemy, that they
burnt the Bible and Confession of Faith. These were the <hi>Sweet Singers,</hi>
as they were called, led away into these Delusions by that Impostor
and Sorcerer, <hi>Iohn Gib,</hi> of which destructive way the approached Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
adhering to the foresaid Testimony, had always an Abhorrence
of. Wherefore that ignorant and impudent Calumny, of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sortship
with <hi>Gibs</hi> Followers, is only the vent of viperous Envy: For
they were the first that discovered them, and reclaimed them, and
were always so far from partaking with them, that to this day these
that have come off from that way, and have offered the Confession of
their Scandal, do still complain of their over-rigid Severity, in not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
them to their select Fellowships.</p>
            <p>Shortly after this, Mr. <hi>Donald Cargill</hi> finished his Testimony, being
apprehended with other two faithful and zealous Witnesses of Christ,
Mr. <hi>William Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Iames Beeg,</hi> who with two more were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
at <hi>Edinburgh 27, Iuly</hi> 1681. Crowned with the Glory of
Martyrdom. Then came the Day of the Remnants vexation; the
Persecution vaxing on the one hand, and a violent Spirit of defection
carrying down the most part of Ministers and Professours before it,
driving them to Courses of sinful and scandalous Conformings with the
Times Corruptions, Compearings before their Courts, Complyings with
their Commands, paying of their Cesses and other Exactions, taking
of their Oaths and Bonds, and countenancing their Prelatical Church-Services,
which they were ashamed to do before: And thereupon on
the other hand the Divisions and Confusions were augmented, and poor
People that desired to cleave to the Testimony, were more and more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
and troubled at the Ministers, who either left the Land, or
lurked in their own retirements.</p>
            <p>But the remaining Contenders fell upon the expedient of corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding
in <hi>General Meetings,</hi> to consult, inform and confirm one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
about common Duties in common Dangers; Laying down this
General Conclusion for a foundation of Order to be observed among
them in incident doubtful Cases, and emergent Controversies, that
<hi>nothing relative to the publick, and which concerns the whole of their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
be done by any of them, without harmonious consent sought after, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59361:26"/>
rationally waited for, and sufficient deliberation about the best means and
manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> as Commissioner from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
held a Parliament, in which he is declared legal and lineal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour;
and a Test is framed for a Pest to Consciences, which turned
out of all Places of Trust any that had any remaining measure of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Honesty. And to all the Cruel Acts then and before made against
the People of God, there was one superadded, regulating the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the rest, whereby at one dash all Civil and Criminal Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
was overthrown, That <hi>the Right of Iurisdiction both in Civil and
Criminal Matters is so inherent in the Crown, that his Majesty may judge
all Causes by himself, or any other he thinks fit to Commissionate.</hi> Here was
a Law for Commissionating Souldiers to take away the Lives of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
as was frequently exemplified afterwards.</p>
            <p>Against which encroachments on Religion and Liberty, the faithful
thought themselves obliged to emit a Testimony. And therefore pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
a Declaration at <hi>Lanerk, Ian.</hi> 12. 1682. Confirming the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Sanquhair,</hi> and adding reasons of their Revolt from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Charles</hi> the Second: <hi>For his arrogantly arrogated Supremacy in all
Causes Civil and Ecclesiastick, and oppressing the Godly for Conscience and
Duty; for installing a Successour, such an one (if not worse) as himself,
and framing the Test;</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And in end offer to prove, they have only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
in this to extricate themselves from under a Tyrannous Yoke, and to
reduce Church and State to what they were in the Years 1648 and
1649.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After which Declaration they were more Condemned by them that
were at ease, than ever. For which Cause, in the next General Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they resolved to delegate some of their number to Forreign
Churches, on purpose to vindicate themselves from these Calumnies;
And withal to provide for a Succession of Witnesses. Therefore by
that means having obtained access for the instruction of some young
Men, at an University in the united Provinces, in process of time,
Mr. <hi>Iames Renwick,</hi> received Ordination there, and came home to
take up the Standard of his Master, upon the ground where it was left.
Which undertaking, notwithstanding all the Rage of Enemies, and all
the Scourge of Tongues of incensed Professours, he Prosecuted by
many weary wandrings, Night and Day, Preaching, Conferring and
Catechising, until, not only was the faithful Witnessing Remnant that
joyned in the Testimony, further cleared, confirmed and encouraged,
and their number much encreased by the coming in and joyning of
many others to the Fellowship of their setled Societies; but also many
others, in other places of the Country were induced to the contracting
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59361:26"/>
themselves in the like, to the setling such Fellowships in most of the
Southern Shires.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But then the fury of Persecutors began to flame more flagrantly than
ever; not only in sending out Cruel Souldiers, Foot, Horse and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
to pursue after them, in the wildest and remotest recesses in the
Wilderness; but emitting Edicts allowing them to kill, slay, hang,
drown, and destroy such as they could apprehend of them</hi> pro libitu;
<hi>and commanding the Country to assist them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For which Cause, to
preserve themselves from, and put a stop to that deluge of Blood, and
demur and deter the Insolency of</hi> Intelligencers <hi>and Informers, they were
necessitate to publish the</hi> Apologetick Declaration, <hi>and affix it upon several
Mercat-Crosses, and Parish-Church Doors,</hi> Nov. 8. 1684. <hi>Wherein</hi> they
declare their firm Resolution of constant adherence to their Covenants and
Engagements, and to the Declarations disowning the Authority of <hi>Charles
Stewart,</hi> and to testifie to the World, that they purpose not to injure or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
any whomsoever, but to pursue the ends of their Covenants, in standing
to the defence of the Work of Reformation, and of their own Lives; yet if
any shall stretch forth their hand against them, by shedding their Blood actually,
either by Authoritative commanding, or obeying such Commands, to search
for them and deliver them up to the spilling of their Blood, to inform against
them, to raise the Hue and Cry after them, and delate them before their
Courts: All these shall be reputed by them Enemies to God and the Covenanted
Reformation, and punished as such, according to their Power, and the degree
of their offence, if they shall continue so malitiously to proceed against them:
And declare, they abhor and condemn any personal attempts, upon any pretext
whatsoever, without previous Deliberation, common or competent consent,
without certain probation by sufficient Witnesses, the guilty Persons Confession,
or the notoriousness of the deeds themselves: And in the end warn the bloody
<hi>Doegs</hi> and flattering <hi>Ziphites</hi> informing against them, to be expect to be
dealt with as they deal with them.</p>
            <p>This Declaration occasioned greater Tryals to them and trouble to
the Country, by the pressing an Oath abjuring the same universaly up
on all, as well Women as Men, and suffering none to Travel without
a <hi>Pass,</hi> declaring they had taken that Oath; and giving power to all
Hostlers and Inn-keepers to impose Oaths upon all Passengers, Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
Gentlemen or Country-men, who were to Swear that their
Passes were not forged. And Prisoners that would not take the Oath,
were according to the foresaid Act, Condemned, and Executed. And
after that, they gave Orders and Commands to the Souldiers to pursue
the Chase after these Wanderers more violently, and shoot, or otherwise
put them to Death wherever they could apprehend them. Hence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
such a slaughter and seizure of them, that common People usually
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59361:27"/>
date their common Occurrences since, from that beginning of <hi>killing
time,</hi> as they call it. Yet that Declaration was so far effectual, as to
scare many from their former diligence in informing against them, and
to draw out some to joyn with the Wanderers more publickly, even
when the danger was greatest of owning any respect to them.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of this <hi>killing time,</hi> the first Author and Authorizer
of all these Mischiefs, <hi>Charles</hi> II. was removed by Death. And the
Duke of <hi>York</hi> succeeding, immediately upon his mounting the Throne,
the Executions and Acts prosecuting the Prosecution of the poor Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
were more Cruel than ever. Now the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> having
been Arraig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed and Condemned for his Explanation of the Test, but
escaped out of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and after him several Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
being arbitrarily oppressed and troubled, upon the Act of <hi>Intercom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning</hi>
with Rebels, and for a pretended Plot against the Government
(as they called it;) and many other Gentlemen having lost either their
Lives or Fortunes, many did resort to the United Provinces. From
whence, as soon as they had provided themselves with Arms, after
the ascending of <hi>Iames</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> they returned to <hi>Scotland,</hi> under
the conduct of the Earl of <hi>Argyle,</hi> their chosen Captain. And <hi>Argyle</hi>'s
Party perceiving that their Enemies were above ten times their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
dispersed, every Man shifting for himself. The Enemies search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Country, gleaned up the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> himself, Col. <hi>Rumbold,</hi>
an English Man, Mr. <hi>Thomas Archer</hi> Minister, <hi>Gawin Russel,</hi> and <hi>David
Law,</hi> who were all Condemned and Executed at <hi>Edinburgh;</hi> and many
others who were Banished to <hi>America:</hi> And about some 20 in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
who were Hanged at <hi>Ineravie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Wanderers, tho' they did not associate with
this Expedition, upon the account of the too promiscuous admittance
of Persons to trust in that party, who were then, and since have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
themselves to be Enemies to the Cause, and because they could
not espouse their Declaration as the State of their Quarrel, being not
concerted according to the constant plea of the <hi>Scots</hi> Covenanters: Yet
against this Usurpation of a Papist, they published another <hi>Declaration</hi>
at <hi>Sanquhair, May</hi> 28. 1685. Wherein, <hi>approving and adhering unto all
their former Declarations, and considering that</hi> James <hi>Duke of</hi> York, <hi>a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
and Excommunicate Papist, was proclaimed; to testifie their Resentment
of that deed, and to make it appear unto the World, that they were free
thereof, by Concurrence or Connivance; they protest against the foresaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
of</hi> James <hi>Duke of</hi> York <hi>as King: In regard that is contrary to
the Declaration of the General Assembly,</hi> July 27, 1649. <hi>And they protest
against the Validity and Constitution of that Parliament, approving and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
the foresaid Proclamation, &amp;c.</hi> This was their Testimony against
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59361:27"/>
Popery in the Season thereof? Which tho' it was not so much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as any former Declarations, yet neither in this had they the
Concurrence of any Ministers or Professours; who as they had been
silent, and omitted a seasonable Testimony against Prelacy and the
Supremacy, when these were introduced, so now also they were left to
let slip this opportunity of a Testimony against Popery, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
of the declining and far degenerate Church of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Yea to
their shame, the very Rabble of ignorant People may be brought as a
Witness against the Body of Presbyterian Ministers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in that
they testified their detestation of the first Erection of the Idolatrous
Mass, and some of the Souldiery, and such as had no Profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
suffered unto Death for speaking against Popery, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
of the King, while the Ministers were silent. And <hi>some of the
Curats, and Members of the late Parliament, 1686. made some stickling
against the taking away of the Penal Statutes against Papists; while Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,
from whom might have been expected greater opposition, were sleeping
in a profound Submission.</hi> I cannot without confusion of Spirit touch
these obvious and dolorous Reflections, and yet in Candour cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
them.</p>
            <p>However the Persecution against the Wanderers went on; there were
more Butchered and Slaughtered in the Fields, than in all the former
Tyrants Reign; there have been more Banished to Forreign Plantations
in this Mans time, than in the others; and there have been more cruel
Acts of Parliament enacted in this Tyrants time, than the former
made all his Reign. For not only was there an Act making it Treason
to refuse the <hi>Oath of Abjuration,</hi> confirming all their procedure hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before; but an Act making it <hi>Criminal</hi> to own the Covenant, and
another Act making it <hi>Criminal</hi> for any to be present at a Field-Meeting,
which was only so to Preachers before. But a relenting abatement of
severity was pretended against other Dissenters.</p>
            <p>At length what could not be obtained by Law at the late Parliament
for taking off the Statutes against Papists, was effectuated by Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
in a Proclamation dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 12, 1687. But this was so gross,
and grievously griping in its restrictions, as to Persons, as to the place,
as to the matter allowed the Presbyterians in Preaching, that it was
disdained of all; and therefore he behoved to busk it better, and
mend the matter, in a Letter to the Council, bearing date <hi>March 31.
1687.</hi> Of this Tenor, <hi>Whereas we did recommend to you to take care, that
any of the Presbyterians should not be allowed to Preach, but such only as
should have your allowance for the same, and that they at the receiving the
Indulgence should take the Oath contained in the Proclamation; these are
therefore to let you know, that thereby we meant such of them as did not so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59361:28"/>
take the Test. But if nevertheless the Presbyterian Preachers do scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to take the said Oath, or any other Oath what soever, and that you shall
find it reasonable or fit to grant them or any of them our said Indulgence,
so as they desire it upon these terms; It is now our Will and Pleasure to grant
them the said Indulgence (during our Pleasure only) or so long as you shall
find they behave themselves regularly and peaceably, without giving any cause
of offence to us, or any in Authority or Trust under us in our Government.</hi>
But at length to take of all difformity and disparity of the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the Toleration in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Declaration for Liberty of
Conscience in <hi>England;</hi> he added a third <hi>eke</hi> to the Liberty, in another
Proclamation dated <hi>Iune</hi> 28, 1687. And this is the Royal Charter for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>curity of the Protestant Religion in lieu of all the Laws, Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Oaths wherewith it was formerly confirmed. This is the
only Patent which the <hi>Royal Dalilees,</hi> the <hi>Moderate Presbyterians</hi> have now
received to ensure their enjoyment of it <hi>durante beneplacito.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as for the poor Wanderers, while others are rejoycing under
the Bramble-shadow of it, they think it a cause of weeping and matter
of mourning, not because they do not share of the benefit of it, but
because they are afraid to share of the Curse of it. For which Cause,
they do look upon it as a seasonable Testimony for the Cause of Christ,
and the Interest of the Protestant Religion, and the Laws and Liberties
of the Country, all overturned and subverted by this Toleration, to
keep their Meetings as in former times; thinking it sinful, scandalous
and inconvenient to seem to homologate this Toleration, the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
whereof they are convinced of, from these Reasons (besides those
for which they rejected the former Indulgencies, Indemnities and Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and those which regard the Granter, as to his Principles and
Religion.</p>
            <p>For considering the <hi>Fountain</hi> whence it flows, they cannot defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with it, it being refounded on Absolute Power, proclaiming by
sound of Trumpet a Power Paramount to all Law; a Power to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
or restrain the Protestant Religion, according to his Royal Will
or Pleasure. Now the acceptance of this Grant, would imply the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance
of this power that the Granter claims in Granting it:
Which utterly dissolves all Government, and all security for Religion
and Liberty.)</p>
            <p>Considering also the <hi>Channel</hi> in which it is conveyed, they cannot
comply with it. Because it comes through such a Conveyance as <hi>Casses,
annulls, stops, suspends</hi> and disables all Penal Laws against Papists, and
thereby eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts all the Securities and legal Bulwarks that Protestants can
have for the establishment of their Religion; yea, in effect leaves no
Laws in force against any that shall attempt the utter subversion of it;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59361:28"/>
but ratifies and leaves in full rigour all wicked Laws and Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
against such as would most avowedly assert it. Hence as he hath
formerly by <hi>Absolute Power</hi> suspended all Laws made for the Protection
of our Religion, so he may when he will dispense with all the Laws
made for its establishment; and those who approve the one by such an
Acceptance, cannot disallow the other, but must recognosce a Power in
the King to subvert all Laws, Rights and Liberties.</p>
            <p>Considering the <hi>Ends</hi> of its contrivance, they dare not have any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to accomplish such wicked Projects, to which this Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
would be so natively subservient. Which Project was discovered in
the English Declaration, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>he heartily wishes that all the People of
these Dominions were Members of the Catholick Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Considering the <hi>Effects</hi> already produced thereby, they cannot but
abhor it. Seeing the Papists are thereby encouraged, all places filled
with Priests and Jesuits; yea, the executive Power of the Government
put into the hands of the Romanists: And on the other hand a T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
against Antichrist is abandoned and laid aside as unseasonable,
the edge of Zeal for the Interest of Christ is blunted, they that should
stand in the Gap and upon the Watch-Tower are laid aside from all
opposition to the invasions of the Enemy, and lulled asleep by this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching
Charm and intoxicating Opium; Ministers and Professours are
generally settling on their Lees and languishing in a fatal security.</p>
            <p>Considering the <hi>Extent</hi> of it, they cannot class themselves among
the number of them that are Indulged thereby. Whereby the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours
of Christ come in as Partners in the same Bargain with Antichrists
Vassals; and the <hi>Lords Ark</hi> hath a place with <hi>Dagon,</hi> and its Priests and
Followers consent to it, and the Builders of <hi>Babel</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> are made
to build together, under the same Protection; and a Sluce is opened
to let the Enemy come in like a Flood, which to oppose, the Accepters
cannot stand in a Gap, nor lift up a Standard against them. All which
is contrary to the Confession of Faith <hi>Ch.</hi> 20. §. 4. And therefore to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of this Toleration is inconsistent with the Principles of the
Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with the <hi>National</hi> and <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi>
and <hi>Solemn Acknowledgment of Sins, and Engagement to Duties;</hi> in all
which we are bound to extirpate Popery. With the whole Tract of
Contendings between the years 1638 and 1660. and particularly by
the Testimony of the Synod of <hi>Fife,</hi> and other Brethren in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
against <hi>Cromwels</hi> vast Toleration and Liberty of Conscience, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
related. For it is plain, if it be not to be suffered, then it is not
to be accepted.</p>
            <p>Considering the <hi>Terms</hi> wherein it is offered, they cannot make such a
shameful bargain. For by it the <hi>Matter</hi> of Preaching is so restricted
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59361:29"/>
and limited, that <hi>nothing must be Preached or Taught, which may any way
tend to alienate the Hearts of the People from him or his Government.</hi> Here
is a Price at which they are to purchase their Freedom, which yet hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can be so exactly paid, but he may find a pretence for retrenching
it when he pleases: For if a Minister shall Preach against the Kings
Religion as Idolatry, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> as <hi>Babylon, &amp;c.</hi> This
shall be interpreted to be an alienation of the Peoples Hearts from the
King and his Government. But who can be faithful, and Preach in
Season and out of Season now, but he must think it his Duty to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
thus to alienate the Hearts of the People? Sure if any Preach
the whole Counsel of God, he must Preach against Popery. And if
he think that this Indulgence, granted and accepted on these Terms,
can supersede him from this Faithfulness, then he is no more the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of Christ, but a pleaser of Men.</p>
            <p>Considering the <hi>Scandal</hi> of it, they dare not so offend the Generation
of the Righteous by the Acceptance, and dishonour God, disgrace the
Protestant Profession, wrong the Interest thereof, and betray their
Native-Country, as thus to comply with the design of Antichrist. And
it cannot but be very stumbling to see the Ministers of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whose
Testimony used to be terrible to the Popish, and renowned through all
the Protestant-Churches, purchasing a Liberty to themselves at the rate
of burying and betraying the Cause into Bondage and restraint, and
thus to be laid by from all active and open opposition to Antichrists
Designs, in such a Season. The World will be tempted to think,
they are not governed by Principles, but their own Interest in this
Juncture, seeking their own things more than the things of Christ;
And that it was not the late Usurpation upon, and overturning of
Religion and Liberty that offended them, so much as the Persecution
they sustained thereby; but that if Arbitrary Power had been exerted
in their favours, tho' with the same prejudice of the Cause of Christ,
they would have complyed with it, as they do now. Alas! Sad and
dolorous have been the Scandals given and taken, by and from the
Declining Ministers of <hi>Scotland</hi> heretofore, but none so stumbling as this.</p>
            <p>Lastly, considering the <hi>Addresses</hi> made thereupon, with such a strain
of fulsom and Blasphemous Flatteries, to the dishonour of God, the
reproach of the Cause, the betraying of the Church, and detriment o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I shall set down the first of their Addresses, and let the Reader judge
whether there be not Cause of standing also off from every appearance

who avouch an Adherence to the Covenanted Reformation, and avow
an opposition to Antichristian Usurpers (which they call <hi>promoting Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal
Principles and Practices)</hi> might not be looked upon as of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy:
For all that abide in the Principles and Practices of the
Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> (which they have deserted) would count it a Sin and
Scandal, to be reckoned of their Association who have thus betrayed
the Cause and the Country. These mutual Complements between
the professed Servants of Christ and the Vassals of Antichrist, if they
be Cordial, would seem to import that they are in a fair way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
their differences, and to accomodate their oppositions at
length: But if they be only adulatory and flattering Complements, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
only a Conjunction of Tails, like <hi>Samsons</hi> Foxes, with a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of Heads and Hearts, tending towards distinct and opposite
interests; then, as they would suit far better the Dissimulations of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians,
than the Simplicity of Gospel-Ministers, and do put upon
them the Brand of being Men-pleasers rather than Servants of Christ,
so for their Dissemblings with Dissemblers, who know their Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to be and take them for such, they may look to be paid home in
good Measure, heaped up and running over, when <hi>such Methods shall be
laid down as shall not be in the Power of any to alter,</hi> when such designs
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59361:31"/>
shall be obtained by this Liberty and these Addresses, that the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bought
Wit of the Addressers shall not be able to disappoint. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Address is such, as makes the thing addressed for to be odious,
and the Addressers to forfeit the respects and merit the indignation of
all that are Friends to the Protestant and <hi>Presbyterian Cause;</hi> as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
from these obvious Reflections.</p>
            <p>1. It was needful indeed they should have assumed the <hi>Name of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi>
and call it <hi>the humble</hi> Address <hi>of Presbyterians Ministers:</hi> For
otherwise it would never have been known to come from Men of the
Presbyterian Perswasion; seeing the Contents of this Address are so
clearly contrary to their known Principles. It is contrary to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Principles, to congratulate an Antichristian Usurper for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
Religion, and overturning Laws and Liberties. It is contrary
to Presbyterian Principles, to justifie the abrogation of the National-Covenant,
in giving thanks for a Liberty whereby all the Laws are
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>assed and disabled, therein confirmed. It is contrary to Presbyterian
Principles, to thank the King for opening a door to bring in Popery,
which they are engaged to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irpate in the Solemn League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
It is contrary to Presbyterian Principles to allow or accept of
such a vast Toleration for Idolaters and Hereticks, as is evident above.
It is contrary to Presbyterian Principles to consent to any Restrictions,
Limitations, and Conditions, binding them up in the Exercise of the
Ministerial function, whereby this Liberty is loaded and clogged: So
that they cannot enjoy it without great hazard of Sin, and incurring
the Guilt of the Blood of Souls, for not declaring the whole Council
of God, which Addressers cannot declare, if they <hi>Preserve an en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ire
Loyalty in their Doctrin,</hi> as here they promise.</p>
            <p>2. There is nothing sounds here like the <hi>Old Presbyterian strain;</hi>
neither was there ever an Address of this stile seen before from <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>
Hands. It would have looked far more <hi>Presbyterian</hi> like, in stead
of this Address, to have sent a Protestation against the new openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
introduction of Popery, and subversion of all Laws and Liberties
which they are Covenanted to maintain; or at least to have given an
Address in the usual Language of Presbyterians, who used always to
speak of the <hi>Covenants,</hi> and <hi>Work of Reformation:</hi> But here never a
word of these, but of <hi>Loyalty</hi> to his <hi>Excellent,</hi> to his <hi>Gracious,</hi> and to
his <hi>Sacred Majesty,</hi> of <hi>Loyalty not to be questioned, an Entire Loyalty in
Doctrin, a resolved Loyalty in Practice,</hi> and a fervent <hi>Loyalty in Prayers:</hi>
And all that they are Sollicitous about, is not lest the Prerogatives of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59361:31"/>
their Master be encroached upon, and the Liberties of the Church be
supplanted, and Religion wronged; but lest their <hi>Loyalty be question<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d,</hi>
and they be <hi>otherwise represented:</hi> And all that they beseech for is, not
that the Cause of Christ be not wronged, nor Antichristian Idolatry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
by this Liberty; but that <hi>these who promove any disloyal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and Practices may be looked upon as none of theirs, wherein</hi> all their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
is, that they <hi>perswade themselves from his Majestys Iustice
and Goodness, that he will not give Credit to any other information until he
take due cognition thereof.</hi> Here is a Lawless unrestricted Loyalty to a
Tyrant, claiming an <hi>Absolute Power to be obeyed without reserve,</hi> not only
professed, but solicitously sought to be the Principle of Presbyterians;
whereas it is rather the Principle of Atheistical <hi>Hobbs</hi> exploded with
indignation by all Rational Men. This is not the Presbyterian Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
to the King, <hi>in the defence of Christ his Evangel, Liberties of the
Country, Ministration of Iustice, and punishment of iniquity,</hi> according to
the National-Covenant; and in <hi>the preservation and defence of the true
Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdoms,</hi> according to the Solemn-League
and Covenant: But an <hi>Erastian</hi> Loyalty to a Tyrant in his overturning
Religion, Laws and Liberties. This Loyalty <hi>in Doctrin,</hi> will be found
Disloyalty to Christ, in a sinful and shameful silence at the wrongs done
to him, and not declaring against the Invasions of his open Enemies.
This Loyalty <hi>in Practice</hi> is a plain betraying of Religion and Liberty,
in lying by from all opposition to the open Destroyer of both. And
this Loyalty in <hi>Prayers,</hi> for <hi>all Blessings ever to attend his Person and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
will be neither conformed to <hi>Presbyterian Prayers</hi> in reference
to Popish Tyrants, nor consistent with the Zeal of Christians, nor
founded upon any Scripture Promises, to pray for Blessings to a Papists
Tyranny, which cannot be of Faith, and therefore must be Sin.</p>
            <p>3. This Address is so stuffed with sheaking Flatteries, that it would
more become Sycophants and Court-Parasites, than Ministers of the
Gospel; and were more suitable to that Popish, Prelatical, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
Faction to congratulate and rejoyce in their professed Patron
and Head, and fill the Gazetts with their Adulatory Addresses, which
heretofore used to be deservedly inveighed against by all Dissenters;
than for Presbyterians to take a Copy from them, and espouse the
Practice which they had condemned before, and which was never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
in any good Government, nor never known in these British
Nations, before <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Usurpation; Flattery being always counted
base among ingenuous Men. But here is a Rhapsodie of Flatteries, <hi>from
the deep Sense they have of his Majesties Gracious and surprizing favour;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59361:32"/>
finding themselves bound in Duty to offer their most humble and hearty thanks
to his Sacred Majesty, the favour bestowed being to them valuable above all
Earthly comforts.</hi> One would think it behoved to be a very great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
from a very great Friend, for very gracious ends: But what is
it? <hi>In not only putting a stop to their long sad Sufferings;</hi> which were some
ground indeed, if the way were Honest: But this <hi>not only</hi> supposes an
<hi>also;</hi> what is that? But also <hi>granting us the Liberty;</hi> which is either a
needless Tautology (for if all Sufferings were stopped, then Liberty must
needs follow,) or it must respect the Qualifications of the Liberty;
flowing from such a <hi>Fountain, Absolute Power;</hi> through such a convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<hi>stopping all Penal Laws</hi> against Papists; in such a Form as a <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi>
for such Ends, as overturning the Reformation and introducing
Popery. This is the Favour for which they offer most humble and
hearty Thanks, more valuable to them than all Earthly Comforts. Sure,
if they thank him for the Liberty, they must thank him for the <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
whereby he grants it, and justifie all his claim there to <hi>Absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
being that upon which it is superstructed, and from which it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergeth;
and so become a listed Faction to abet and own him in all his
attemptings, engaged now to <hi>demean themselves as that he may find Cause
rather to enlarge than to diminish his favours,</hi> which can be no other way
but in assisting him to destroy Religion and Liberty, at least in suffering
him to do what he will without controll. O what an indeliberate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
is this for Ministers, who pretend to be yet for the defence of
the Gospel, thus to be found betraying Religion, through justifying and
magnifying a Tyrant, for his suspension of so many Laws, whereby it was
established and supported!</p>
            <p>4. It were more tolerable if they went no farther than Flatteries;
but I fear they come near the Border of <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> when they say, that
<hi>the Great God hath put this in his Royal Heart;</hi> which can bear no other
Construction but this, that the Holy Lord hath put it in his Heart to
assume to himself a Blasphemous and Absolute Power, whereby he stops
and suspends all Penal Laws against Idolaters, and gives a <hi>Toleration</hi>
for all Errors: If it be capable of any other Sense, it must be like that
as the Lord is said to have moved <hi>David</hi> to number the People, or that
<hi>Rev. 17. 17. God hath put it in their Hearts to fulfill his Will, and to agree
and give their Kingdom to the Beast.</hi> But to bless God, and thank the
Tyrant for this wicked Project, as deliberate and purposed by Men, I
say is near unto Blasphemy. And again where they say, <hi>they are firmly
resolved by the help of God so to demean themselves as his Majesty may find
Cause rather to enlarge than to diminish his favours;</hi> this in effect is as
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59361:32"/>
great Blasphemy, as if they had said, They resolved by the help of God
to be as unfaithful Time-serving and silent Ministers as ever plagued
the Church of God; for no otherwise can they demean themselves so as
he may find cause to enlarge his Favours towards them, it being no way
supposable that his enlarging his Favours can consist with their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but if they discover any measure of Zeal against Antichrist, he
will quickly diminish them.</p>
            <p>Thus far I have compendiously deduced the Account of the progress
and Prosecution of the Testimony of this Church to the present State
thereof.</p>
