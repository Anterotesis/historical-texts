         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Sacrament, if he desires to receive it, in case hee professe his sincere repentance for his sins past, and promise newnesse of life for time to come, though in his own private opinion, he may chance to judge him a person unfit or unworthy to communicate? If yea, let him shew his charter for it in Scripture: This I am certain hee cannot doe: If he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage, hee cannot do it in point of Conscience, because hee should bee paraker of his sin, <hi>if he eate and drink damnation</hi> by unworthy receiving: The Apostle resolves the contrary; that <hi>hee eates and drinkes damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only to HIMSELFE,</hi> not to the Minister, or the other <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants;</hi> that he shall only beare his own burthen, and give an account of himselfe to God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 12. And the administration being onely the Ministers act, which is a holy and divine institution, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy participation the parties owne iniquity, (as is his unworthy hearing, praying <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) not the Ministers; it can no more involve the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in the guilt of it, then his unprofitable hearing; of which no Minister holds himselfe guilty, who with care and conscience faithfully dispenceth the Word unto his Auditors, <hi>Eze.</hi> 33. 1. to 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 26. 27; which <note n="(*)" place="margin">

            <p>Seeing therfore there is as much danger to peoples Soules in their unworthy, unprofitable hearing of the word, as receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; and since Ministers are and may be unto <hi>God a Sweet savour of Christ,</hi> as well in them <hi>that perish,</hi> by unworthy receiving the Sacrament as in them that are saved, by worthy participation thereof; as they are in the preaching of the Gospell, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16. I cannot discerne any shadow of reason, why any godly Ministers should over-earnestly contest for such a large or unlimited Ecclesiasticall power, to exclude their Christian Brethren from the Sacrament (when not actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated from the Church and other Ordinances) as some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to; much lesse, why any of them should resolve to give over their Ministery to which Christ hath called them, in case they cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine such a power from the Parliament, as neither Christ, nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, nor the Primitive Christians in the purest times did ever exercise; or why any shold forwardly seperate from our Church, in case such an unlimited arbitrary power be not established in our new Presbiteries, as our very Lordly Prelats never durst to claime. <hi>Moderata durant.</hi> Wherefore my earnest request to all Ministers and people shall be, to rest fully satisfied with such a limited Iurisdiction in this kind, as our Honourable, Parliament upon serious debate, shall in their Piety and Wisdom thinke meete to settle, for the prevention of scandall, Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the people, of Tyranny and oppression of mens consciences in the Presbytery; the only desirable boundary betweene these two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, which must be avoyded with all speciall care.</p>
