         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Many men blunder about this blessed Tincture which have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Learning nor any sight in Philosophy, which causeth great slander and mocking to the great rebuke of this noble and glorious Science of Grace, which Science and cunning is contained only in natural moving or circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and rotation of the Heavens above, as all natural things do in this World by pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their circuit, which the high Creator of Nature keepeth in His marvellous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power there as he beginneth and not else.</p>

But I assure and certifie you, that I have seen with mine Eyes visible like as I have afore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. And I take to witness <hi>Reymond</hi> in the 67 Chapter, where he maketh thereof an open certification to all his Friends that he and others have done and proved visible these Acts. Here I leave to write other ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral sayings of Philosophers, for I intend but only to proceed in this peculiar thing, which I know is possible to be done: But it is the hardest Science in the World to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing Man. And it is lightest after it is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54825:22"/>
understood and known; as I have proved my self by Experience of my Calces divers ways, sometime with <hi>Blood of common Vitriol,</hi> and after I have decocted it in the <hi>Vegetable Mercury</hi> ten or twelve days, and of that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I have had fine Silver after the quantity. Also I have examined this Calce of Silver and O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The second cause why I do not conclude, is part for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: for this Science requireth three things special to conclude it: One is great ingeny and a perfect reason in understanding and handling thereof: <hi>The second is many Books to lead a man from one dark saying to another that giveth Light</hi>; and the third is Wordly goods to maintain the Expences and Labour, the Substance of the two Lights which the <hi>Mercury</hi> must have to work upon, <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> for that Substance shall never be lost, though the Work-man do err in his work, but it shall be rather finer and better then it was at the beginning. Nevertheless, a man may labour against Nature and destroy and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54825:22"/>
spoyl the good Bodyes. Wherefore I advise every man not to meddle with this Science unless they be well learned and practised. Many men do boldly meddle and clatter therein saying, it is a thing cast in the Street and costeth nought, and every man hath it, as well the Poor as the Rich, and every time and place, it is in every Hill and in every Dale, and the Value at the beginning costeth not past fifty pence. All these things be true to them that truly understand them. Also they say <hi>it is a Natural Mercury</hi> which cost no Money which is the privity and all the ground of our Wisdom: And all this is no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>easing, but although it cost nought, yet it is not had of nought, and of a little substance for ye cannot have as much Wheat of a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as of a Bushel; then mark well this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: <hi>If you will have much of this Natural Mercury or privy Corruption, which is the Root and Foundation of all these wonderful things,</hi> thou must have great quantity of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, I say to thee as a Friend: If you put 20 pound weight of the Body that <hi>Aristotle</hi> declareth with <hi>

hadst seen the privity thereof, thou wouldest soon believe it, and thou wouldest marvel thereof it is so light and easie a thing, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at thy hand if thou have Grace to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>that Corruption.</hi> But thou that labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest herein must understand of <hi>two manner of Corruptions</hi> after the definitions of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers: <hi>One is Corruption alterative,</hi> and the other is <hi>Corruption dissipative.</hi> And if you be a very true Philosopher then shalt thou know these two Corruptions, as well by the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick as by the Practick, and I say to thee of a Truth that of this <hi>Corruption</hi> is a new Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that bringeth forth <hi>this blessed Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,</hi> but <hi>corruptio dissipativa</hi> shall never be brought to natural kind again, and they that labour in this <hi>Corruption</hi> shall never lose but their time for lack of good understanding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> for they may save their good Bodies ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Now <hi>Corruptio alterativa</hi> is evermore in generation, as the Philosopher doth make mention <hi>de Generatione &amp; Corruptione, unde Corruptio unius est Generatio alterius,</hi> &amp;c. And if they err in this Corruption yet shall they save all their Substance of the Bodies that shall never be the worse in Comparison in quantity but the better rather in quality, as is aforesaid. Therefore if thou be a wiseman thou shalt have thy Substance, as surely as in thy Coffer, for as he standeth in the <hi>humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

and Corruption,</hi> so long is he growing in his own natural kind. Therefore consider this Example, and understand <hi>well these Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi>: For that I have seen I testifie to you of Truth, I take God of Heaven to Witness, and advise ye well e're you begin to make <hi>thy Mercury Vegetable and flying</hi>; but first of all e're you begin I read ye know well thy Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and take them of <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Hermes,</hi> and of the fourth Book of <hi>Meteors</hi> of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and there you shall find this Principle, where he sayeth, <hi>Sciant Artifices Alchymiae spes va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae transmutari non po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Then I ask what is the first matter or substance of Sperm? I say to thee Food; as Meat and Drink. Then it appeareth, that Meat and Drink is the first Substance of Sperm, and Sperm is the very true Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and matter to bring forth man: So likewise in Mercury of white matter, and of white Substance cometh that Mercury: For so he is of a pure subtil Earth, Sulphur most clear and most subtil commixed with pure Water and with Commixtion and heat, these two Elements digesteth with Temperance of heat and so turneth into Mercury the Sperm of Metals, <hi>therefore Water and Earth is the first

matter of Mercury, and Mercury is the first mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all Mettals, and when they be put into that Water, they all melt and dissolve in him as the Ice doth in warm Water,</hi> and why do they so, because they were first Water coupled by cold, and now here is <hi>Aristotles</hi>'s Principle as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soyled.</p>
                  <p>And although there were two things first, yet nevertheless when they be resolved into clear currant Mercury, and no palpable thing of the Body seen nor felt, but passeth through the Philter clean as Water, then is it, but one thing, upon the which all Philosophers accord and ground them, <hi>est una Sola res.</hi> And here now I have shewed you more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then it hath been shewed here before.

                  <p>COnsidering the long Desires and Hopes of the Students in the Chymick Art, I will in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Treatise briefly and openly declare this Art. First therefore the Subject of the Art is to be known, in the second place, the Foundation, in the third, the Progress, fourthly and lastly, the Extraction of the Elements: Which being known, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one may most easily attain the end of the Art.</p>
                  <p>The Subject of this admired Science is <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> or rather Male and Female, the Male is hot and dry, the Female cold and moyst, and know for a certain that our Stone is not compounded of any other thing, although many Philosophers name several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, of which they speak Sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:54825:46"/>Nevertheless by <hi>Scotus, Hortulanus,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Christopher Parisiensis,</hi> and very many others, many other things for an other Cause are sophistically reckoned up, that Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Men may be deceived, because it is not fit for Fools to know our Secrets: And this is it, which I thought fit at this time to propound concerning the Subject of our Art.</p>
                  <p>The Foundation of this Art, is the Knowledge of the four Qualities, and that in the beginning of the work, Coldness and Moysture have the Dominion: For as <hi>Scotus</hi> saith, As the Sun dryeth up the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Water in Fenny and Boggy Places, after the same manner our Sulphur when it is joyned with its Water or Mercury, doth by little and little consume and drink up the same by the help of the Fire, and that by the assistance of the only living God.</p>
                  <p>The Progress is nothing else than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54825:46"/>But now all skill consisteth in drawing forth the Elements, wherefore read over that which followeth so often, until thou canst conceive and understand it; and know that no one ever spoke so plainly as I in this Place, as thou wilt find by what followeth: Therefore give thanks to the great God, and be grateful to thy Friend who communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thee this Tractate: Live also accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to God and reason, because Divine Wisdom will not enter into a wicked Soul, nor into a Body subjected to Sins.</p>
                  <p>The Extraction of the Elements is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Composition of Blackness, Whiteness, Yellowness, and Redness: And know that Natures ought to be drawn from their Root. But the Root is a certain Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Elements, consisting in Sulphur and Mercury, which they call a confused Mass. But the Natures, which are drawn forth from the Root are Sulphur and Mercury, which when they are joyned together are separated, and purified, that they may be the better mingled afterwards, and united with the Body, out of which they are drawn. And after the Colours have passed, and that which is above, is made like that which is below, and that which is below like that above, then Miracles will from thence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.

                  <p>Now remaineth the Multiplication, in which this briefly is to be noted; That the <hi>Elixir</hi> ought to be nourished out of the same things, from which at first it had its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. No Philosopher before now hath so openly declared this, as I have here done; and that for two Causes, first because from the beginning to the end of the work a long time is required, although some Philosophers do say, the Stone may be made in one day, and others in one month: But know that they speak Enigmatically, and that their words ought not thus to be understood.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless I say with <hi>Scotus</hi> that the Stone or perfect work may be made in one year. Secondly, because Man's Life is short, and he groweth Old, before he comprehendeth and understandeth what is needful to be done in the Composition of the Stone. And therefore I have here so openly explained all things, least this, so noble a Science, should be lost and perish.</p>

And when it groweth red, they call the same Gold and Ferment. But they do not vary in the thing it self, when that is always one thing only, and the same mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and always of the same Nature, in which nothing entreth which is not drawn from it, and this which is next to it, and of its Nature. And this is most true, to wit, the Stone is one, and one Medicine, and it is a Water clear, and bright, permanent, pure and shining, of a Celestical Colour. And if Water did not enter into our Medicine, it could not purifie nor mend it self, and so thou couldst not obtain thy desire: But that which doth mend it is <hi>Sol,</hi> for the Water cannot be made better without it: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Sol</hi> and his shadow a tinging Poyson can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be generated.

                        </gap> Act and suffer each from other. For Matter would flow infinitely, if a Form did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard and stop its Flux. Wherefore when the Body is a Form informing, it doth inform and retain the Spirit, that it afterwards can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not flow any more.</p>
                     <p>The Body therefore doth tinge the Spirit, and the Spirit doth penetrate the Body, whereas one Body cannot penetrate an other Body, but a subtil Spiritual congealed Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance doth penetrate and give Colour to the Body. And this is that Gummy and Olea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous Stone, proportioned in its Natures, containing a Spiritual Nature occul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>y in it self together with the Elements purifyed. Therefore the Philosophers-Stone is to be wholy reduced into this Gumminess by the last Reiteration or Inceration of a certain gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Flux, resolving all the Elements, that they flow like Wax. But when it is the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54825:48"/>
Stone, it appeareth like Copper, whereas notwithstanding it is a certain Spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, penetrating and colouring or tinging all Metallick Bodys.</p>
                     <p>From hence thou mayst easily guess, that this doth not proceed from the cras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And know that our Mercurial Water is a living Water, and a burning Fire, mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tearing in pieces Gold more than common Fire. And therefore by how much more it is better mixed, rubbed and ground with it, by so much more it destroyeth it, and the living fiery Water is more attenuated. But now when three are made one in the Form of a congealed Substance, then it hath in it a true Tincture, which can endure the Violence of the Fire. Therefore when the Body is so tinged, it can tinge another, and it hath in it self all Tincture and Virtue. And from hence all they who tinge with

                        <hi>Sol</hi> and his Shadow, <hi>(viz.)</hi> with the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that is <hi>Argent vive,</hi> do perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat our Stone, which we call the great and perfect Gumm. And know for certain that it is not necessary, that our Stone or Gumm lose its first Mercurial Nature in the Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its crude and first Spirit: for the Oyl and Gumm pertaining to this Stone are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, then the Elements themselves Mercurialized, and made equal together, shut up and coagulated, resoluble and living, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or bound in the viscosity of the Oyly Earth, and inseparably mixed. And we ought to know that that Gum or Oyl is first drawn out of the Bodys, which being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it is reduced into a Spirit, until the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous humidity of the Water be turned into Air, drawing one Element out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by digestion until the Form of Water be converted into the Nature of Oyl, and so our Stone in the end getteth the Name of Gumm and Sulphur.</p>
                     <p>But whosoever hath brought the Stone thus far, that it appear like a mixing Gumm, and suffereth it self to be mixed with all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Bodies, he verily hath found a great Secret of Nature, because that is a perfect Stone, Gum and Sulphur.</p>

this Divine Science. And first, when he saith, put into the Water, or putrifie the Earth in Water, this signifieth nothing else, then the Extraction of Water out of Earth, and the pouring of Water upon the Earth, so long until the Earth putrifie and be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, otherwise it would not bring forth its Fruit.

Judge ye your selves: For you know that Air is warm and moyst, and ye have the saying of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienus</hi> concerning the dissolution of Air, Earth, Fire and Water.

                  <p>I Salute or greet unto thee, most dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, the Glass of Alchemy, which in my heart I have figured or Printed, and out of the Books of wise-Men have drawn, in the which is contained fully all that they have gathered to the Perfection of Alchimy, I do give it unto your Person, and in the which all things which are required to this Art be here gathered together, and those which be in divers places dispersed: I shall thus answer unto your Prudence and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, all things be created of the four Elements, and they be the Roots and matters of all things, and the diversity of things consisteth in three, that is to say, Colour, Tas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e and Smell. There is not to me but three <hi>viz.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities of Elements, divers Proportions, divers Decoctions, and divers Mixtions. Wherefore if ye will one Metalline Body transform into another, ye must know the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54825:67"/>
Nature of one contrary and of another in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very diversity, and when you know this, then you may by Addition and Substraction, put to more of one Element, and the less of another, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eeth them together well or evil, and also to mix them together well or evil unto your own will and desire. And that may a Man do well in Metalls if he might know without errour, how to separate the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is to say, to reduce them to their first Matter and Root, which Root is Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone and Quicksilver or Sulphur and ☿, and then that is the Root or Matter nearest or nearer; but because the separation of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Metalls is difficult and hard, the Masters did seek how to get the Roots nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest without any labour, from Brimstone and Quicksilver, and of these they made their Separation of Elements, which they used, and said that only the Elements did cleave in Metalls, and that strange Elements of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, as the blood, Eggs and Hair, do not enter but by Vertue or by Commixtion of them, with the aforesaid Elements, drawn of the Spirits and Bodies Metalline; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we cannot resolve or separate as Nature doth, for Nature separateth without Appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of any strange thing in the space of a thousand years, and we cannot live a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years, therefore if we will make this
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54825:67"/>
Separation we must find the cunning or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by the which we may do it sooner; but this we cannot do by no ways except <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e do put unto them things divers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarious, for by his contraries ought ye to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the Elements by our Knowledge and Mastery, therefore when two contrary things be mixed together one worketh in another, and so maketh him to give of his Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Virtue, part thereof; for this cause ye must first learn to know the Complexion and Properties of all things, before you do enterprise to make commixtion together in their proper Natures, and it is needful that you know the works of Nature which you intend to do, and how much and what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing doth give, of his Nature and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, and how much, and what he lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of another Complexion and Nature, by the means of the working which you do, and by the Nature of contrary things, which you do commix together, and if you do err in any of these, to know how much and in what; for if you know this, then you do know how to rectifie any thing of the World, and to reduce any thing unto his first Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Complexion, or to any other thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your desire; then by the contrary, if you know not this you shall not enterprise to meddle, but by means of some things
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54825:68"/>
to attempt to make ingression or such like until you do know this, and this is in light or in light things, and the Philosophers do say that if any Man do know how to convert one Nature into another he knoweth all the whole Mastery: and <hi>Avicen</hi> doth say the same, that so it is, all your desire ought to be to this, for this which I have said be the beginnings or Roots of <hi>Alchemy</hi> Philosophical and Medicine. And without the Knowledge of these Roots (if you will do any work or Medicine, which is called the <hi>Elixir</hi> in this Art to transmute imperfect Bodies into <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Lune,</hi> of whatsoever the Medicine was in his Confection) you must think well of four things which I shall tell you.</p>
                  <p>The first is, that you do know how to prepare well all your things, and that you do know how to remove that which doth hurt most, and that which doth comfort your Intention, and that you know the sign when you have that which you desire to have, and that you know how to remove that which you ought to remove: For all that Man doth hath an end, and a certain Term, for according to Philosophers when Nature intendeth to destroy any thing, to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate another thing, worse or better, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to seek a certain degree which it doth not pass beyond and so standeth, and then
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54825:68"/>
another thing preparate, doth so provoke another special form which he had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>The second is, that your things preparate you do know to commix them well toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that is of sundry and divers things to make one Substance to be inseparable for ever; for if you know not how to mix your things well and naturally, so that every thing be destroyed, and so brought first unto their own primary being and proper species, and one new thing to be generated of them, it is worth nothing that you have done, and that you know the sign when your mixtion is compleated.</p>
                  <p>The third is, that you know the certain proportion, that is, the certain quantity of such things as thou oughtest to mix together, and also to know by reason why it should be so, that thereby you may be sure to find the thing that you look for: By the quantities that you know to have mixed upon your melted Bodies, it will away at the last slowly or quickly how well soever the things were prepared, without they were mixed together according to Knowledg and Nature thou hast lost all thy Labour as much as the final com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement doth contain, and that shall be well perceived in the Examination thereof, when the Body transmuted is put to Examination in
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54825:69"/>
Ashes or the Test, for there he will consume and waste away according as there was too much or too little of his Proportion at the first; but if the Proportions were rightly mixed according to Knowledg and Reason, then it shall not do so. And <hi>Rasis</hi> saith, if thou knowest how to convert <hi>Lune</hi> into <hi>Sol,</hi> thou knowest the contrary, that is to say, <hi>Sol</hi> into <hi>Lune.</hi> But to know to do this, there is a certain Term and quantity hidden, which for to know thou oughtest not a little to study, that is to say, thou oughtest thereabout greatly to study, for <hi>Rasis</hi> saith, that the wise-Men did never hide any thing but quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and weight, and we care not whether People do know it or no, for we have made and written our Books unto you that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what we mean, and to our Sons and Children. And when you know that then may you well perceive that no Author or Book doth agree or accord with other in Weight and quantity, and therefore for lack of the Knowledg thereof riseth a great errour, and it is hidden for this Cause, that none but a wise-Man and learned may compass to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the same, which doth all his things with Knowledg and Reason, of the subtil Knowledg of Natural things; for if it might be had otherwise, Men which do meddle without Knowledg and reason; but only
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54825:69"/>
through Foolish boldness might have come to the end, they would no more have cared for the Learning and Wisdom of wise-Men, than for Dogs, if that their own proper Industry and Wit could have helped them to have found or gotten it.</p>
                  <p>The fourth thing which you ought to consider, is the greatest Secret of all and mighty Wisdom, that is, that you know how to fortifie your Medicine and multiply his Vertue, and this is a work of great Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Wisdom, and if you understand this last, one part of your Medicine will not only convert ten parts of any Body melted but a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, ten thousand thousand, and much more without end, according to the several Circulations you shall make. And this which I have now said if you do understand, it sufficeth you, and I have touched all things that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and they which do understand those things, they know the Art and none other, and to speak of this Art is to speak by means as we have spoken, and to work the Art of <hi>Alehemy</hi> is to work as we have said, and to teach the Art is to teach as we have taught, and he that teacheth any other teacheth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and he that wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth any otherwise worketh nothing. For who so desireth this Art, if he do err in any of the aforesaid Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54825:70"/>
he shall never come to good end, until he knoweth the foresaid Articles, and the wise-Man saith that Glass purgeth Metalline Bodies Corrupt, and cleanseth them: For Glass maketh the Metalline Bodies of hard Fusion, soft in fusion, and this is a Secret. And with salt Bodies are calcined and dryed, for salt doth cleanse the Bodies in as much as he dryeth up the Sulphur which is in them, by the which humidity they stink and be black and burnable, for the Bodies calcined is clean suffering the Fire without stinking, and this is a great Secret; but know you that it is spoken for another Secret, which I will not show here, nor yet will write of it, for it is the Secret of all Secrets; for by that Secret, when it is well and perfectly known, a Man may come to the Secrets of all other kinds, and of this Secret, I have shewed you part, and if you know not that which resteth, I will declare no more neither by Tongue nor Pen. Now is ended the Glass of <hi>Alche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> which I have given for his Name worthy the same, for in that you may when you will, behold, and see as in a Glass contained all the Articles pertaining to this Art, which you should desire of wise-Men, I believe that the Roots were never so gathered together as they be here, for the which, understand you, and bear it in Memory according to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54825:70"/>
knowledg, and that you do both hide and open according to reason, and as it ought to be, and not to shew it to every Rybald ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lightness of the Mind, for then that shall be vile which now is precious. In all the aforesaid Articles I will make you Answer, if I have Life and Health, either by Mouth Writing or Words, so that you shall understand it if God will, and thus endeth the true Glass of <hi>Alchemy.</hi>

Then I thought with my self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon which meditated resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I gave him a Viol glass, with a small quantity of this Oyl, distilled from Sulphur Vive burning, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

how to make it as he should afterward need it; I advised him of this liquor, he should take two drops before each Meal in a small draught of Beer, and not ordinarily to exceed that Dose, nor to intermit the use of it, taking for granted, that two drops of that Oyl contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a large quantity of the fume of Sulphur, the man took my advice, and at this day in the year 1641. he is lusty and in good health, walks the Streets at <hi>Brussels,</hi> without complaint, and is likely longer to live, and that which is most remarkable, in this whole space of forty one years, he was not so much as ill, so as to keep his Bed, yea, although (when of a great age) in the depth of Winter, he broke his Leg, near to his Ancle-Bone, by a fall upon the Ice, yet with the use of this Oyl, he recovered without the least Symptome of a Fever, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in his old age, poverty had reduced him to great straits, and hardship, and made him feel much want of things necessary for the comfort and conveniency of Life; yet he lives healthy and sound, though spare and lean.

                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:54825:75"/>Thus far <hi>Helmont,</hi> which relation as it is most remarkable, so it gives the Philosophical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his advice, on which it was grounded: And elsewhere the same Author relates how by this liquor he cured many dangerous deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fevers, which by other Doctors had been given over for desperate. And in other places he commends it as a peerless remedy to asswage the insatiable thirst which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies most Fevers.</p>
                  <p>To which relation and testimony of this most learned Doctor, and acute Philosopher, I shall add my own experience.</p>

vulgar experiment, I shall pass it over, and come to those uses which are most beneficial, and desirable.</p>
                  <p>It is an excellent cleanser of the Teeth, being scoured with it, they will become as white as the purest Ivory, and the mouth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing washed with Oyl dropped in water or white-Wine, so as to make it only of the sharpness of Vinegar, it prevents the growing of that yellow scale which usually adheres to the Teeth, and is the forerunner of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Against a tickling cough and hoarsness, it is a rare remedy, not only taken two or three drops, twice a day inwardly, in the usual drink one useth before each meal, but also by gargling the Throat with it, and (so used) it is excellent against swelled Throats, <hi>Angi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s,

                     <hi>Struma</hi>'s, Palates of the mouth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, or the <hi>Vvula</hi> of the Throat, or the <hi>Almonds</hi> of the Ears, which are (usually said then to be) fallen; It is excellent also against the Head-ach, and to divert Rheums from the Eyes, to wash the Temples there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, likewise to take away <hi>Tetters, Morphew, Itch,</hi> or <hi>Scabs,</hi> this dropped in water is a pleasant, safe, and effectual remedy.</p>
                  <p>Besides which outward applications, it is a Lord internally taken, preventing corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rooting out the seeds thereof, though never so deeply concealed in the body, and upon that score opening inveterate obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eradicating old pains, and preventing otherwise usual relapses into Stranguretical, Colical, or Arthritical pains: it is abstersive, cleansing all Excrementitian setlings in the Mesaraick or Mesenterial Vessels, and so cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the original sourse, and taking away the cause of putrefactive corruption, which is the productive beginner of very many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.</p>
                  <p>On this score it lengthens the life, and fress the body from many Pains and Ailes, to which otherwise it would be subject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:54825:76"/>It is a pleasant remedy, having only a little sharpness, which to the Palate is most grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and yet this Acidity is contradistinct from that Acidity which is the forerunner of putrefaction, which it kills and destroys, as the Acidity of Spirit of Vitriol is destroyed by the fixed Acrim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Praeternatural heat and thirst in Fevers, is no way allayed so speedily, and easily, as by this, nor is there any thing that for a constant continuance may be more safely and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly taken; Spirit of Salt (such as the noble <hi>Helmont</hi> speaks of) alone may be joyned with this, for its safety, and continual use with profit, especially in Nephritical distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and the heat or sharpness of Urine.</p>
                  <p>Now as this is so noble a medicine, so there is none in the World more basely adulterated and counterfeited, our wise Doctors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending for it (<hi>quid pro quo</hi>) an adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mineral acidity of Vitriol, distilled in a Retort form vulgar Sulphur, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Chemists prepare, and sell for, and the Knavish Apothecarries use, and give to their Patients instead of this tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Most sottish is that Maxime of the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, that Spirit of Sulphur and Vitriol are of one nature, when experience teacheth, that the meer Acetosity of Vitriol (which brings over nothing of its excellent vertue) will dissolve Argent Vive, which the strongest Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sulphur, truly, and not sophistically made, will not touch, nor will that recover Beer or Wines, or preserve them, as this will do, one therefore is an unripe Esurine Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tosity, of little vertue: the other a Balsom of an Antidotary vertue, a preservative against corruption, and upon that score nothing can be used more effectually as a preservative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, or a remedy in, <hi>Contagious Fevers, Small-Pox, Measles,</hi> or <hi>Pestilence</hi> than this, nor more ridiculously than the other, which being drawn from the vulgar Sulphur, that hath an infection of malignity mixed with it (which it took from the Arsenical nature of the Minerals from which it was melted) adds nothing of vertue to the <hi>crude vitriolate</hi> Spirits, but only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

danger and hazard, but not a jot more good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than it was, when first drawn from the Vitriol; which being of it self clear, and crude, is for to deceive the ignorant (by its Colour,) tincted with some Root or Bark; Thus the credulous world is imposed on, and cheated, while instead of most noble remedies (in name promised) adulterated trifles are produced, to the Disparagement of Art, and the scandal and reproach of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors Medicine.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>My fifth and last Petition should be to move us to a Christian charity. And if that <hi>Roman</hi> Poet and Oratour, that sententious <hi>Seneca</hi> in the danger and distress of a private Friend could give in Precept: <hi>Quod amico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum necessitati magis occurrendum, quam suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currendum,</hi> that we ought rather to prevent then relieve the necessity of a Friend. Then what is to be expected at our hands in a case of so great weight and importance, as doth not only touch the credit of our Profession; but also the lives and welfare of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of our poor Christian Brethren, whereof some cannot labour, and many are without labour, and those which labour can hardly maintain themselves by their labour? Yea if we would look more narrowly and pierce more deeply with a sharp eye into the threats and terrours of these times, though Religion could wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54825:83"/>
and those which are dear unto us, that we should not stay so long until our Neighbours flames take hold of our own Houses, nor try the extremities that Hunger, and Famine may work amongst us.</p>

Then take them out, and lay them abroad upon Canvas, supported with frames, and being dry grind them with hand-mills, and they make a most white and pure meal, which either of it self, or by the mixture of one third of wheat meal with it, maketh a most fair and savoury bread. This carrieth some good sence and likelyhood of truth with it, for we find by daily experience, that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth as fair, if not a fairer starch, then our wheat.

When you would use this starch, if you desire to have your ruffs to carry a pure and perfect white colour, you must mingle some blew with the water, stirring it up and down with your finger in a Porrenger, and before the blew settle to the bottom, wet your ruff therein, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently wring it out again; then put it till it be clear, and after set it, as you do in your common starch. I do find by experience, that half the time that is lost in the other manner of starching, is here gained: For by reason that your starch is in a thin water, the Lawn and Cambrick will be soon cleared and with much less beating. And I think that a second profit will here likewise fall out by
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54825:90"/>
the way, <hi>viz.</hi> That your Lawn and Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick will last much longer: For (if I be not deceived) the continual patting, or beating thereof between the hands in our usual starching, worketh a great fretting and wearing of the same. And I doubt not, but that there be many other sorts of Grain, Pulse and Roots, which will make as good Starch as Wheat, which at this time I leave unto the studious indeavours of those that are careful for the common good. It may be that at my better leisure I may handle this subject more at large, but now the present times inforce me, to deliver that knowledg which I have. And thus much for starch.</p>

                     <p>THE Fear of the Lord is the beginning of our Work, and the end Charity, and love of our Neighbour. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring therefore with the assistance of our good God upon so divine a Work, it must be first enquired, what the subject thereof is. For as a Plough-man in vain prepares his Ground for Harvest, unless he be assured of the Seed; so also he prepares the Chymical Ground without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ny recompence, if he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54825:108"/>
knows not what he sows therein: and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in at this day many do perplex themselves, and are hurried into different opinions.</p>
                     <p>But this is not a place to discuss all these things, whilst some do seek it in the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Kingdom in Blood, Sperm, Sweat, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, Hair, Dung, Egs, Serpents, Toads, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others are with great diligence imploy'd in the Vegetable Kingdom, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Wine for the unprofitable Magistery. For though it be manifest to us, that the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Medicine of our health may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in either Kingdom, and indeed in Man, (especially in his heart) as also in Wine: for as Gold contains the vertues of all Minerals, so do these two comprehend the powers of all Animals and Vegetables as contracted into one; yet that the great work of Philosophers could be made from them, was never in the thought of any Adept, it is therefore requisit to be sought in the Mineral Kingdom. But there is also here a great company of Dissenters, so that we have need of an <hi>Oedipus.</hi> For some there be that think to extract it out of the middle Minerals, as they call them, namely, Salt, Nitre, Alom, and such other, but all in vain, because they have in them no Argent vive, into which they may be resolved; in which error even we in our primitive ignorance were also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54825:108"/>
It remains therefore to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that Metals are the Physical subject of our blessed Stone. But here also the matter is in suspence, because Metals are some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and some imperfect.</p>
                     <p>But in fine we say, that all fused Metals, but especially the not fused, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, may by the intimate depuration of their original pollution (which yet is very difficult, and by outward appearance scarce possible) be the subject of the Stone, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, saith <hi>Flamel,</hi> some have operated in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> others in <hi>Saturn,</hi> but I (saith he) have operated and found it out in <hi>Sol</hi>: and in <hi>Exercit. ad Turbam</hi> it is read, <hi>That all Metals clean and unclean are internally</hi> Sol, <hi>and</hi> Luna, <hi>and</hi> Mercury, <hi>but there is one true</hi> Sol, <hi>which is drawn from them.</hi> And the Author of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He proceeds thus: <hi>Perfect Bodies are endowed with a more perfect Seed; under the hard shell therefore of the perfect Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals lieth the perfect Seed, which he that knoweth how to extract by Philosophical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, is entred into the Royal Path.</hi> So

                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the Calcination of Bodies out of the secret Work of the <hi>Doctor and Bishop of Trent</hi> for the Philosophers Stone: Metals to be dissolved ought to be first calcined or purged in <hi>Lac virginis,</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> being most fine and subtilly filed, must be dissolved in <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and distilled rain-water in which <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> or common Salt hath been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54825:112"/>
then it must be precipitated into a most white Calx, and washed in decanted water, and the Calx must be edulcorated in other rain-water hot, that all the saltness and acrimony may be taken away, then must it be dryed, and it will be a most pure Calx.</p>
                     <p>But Gold must be calcined after this manner: Make an <hi>Amalgame</hi> with Gold (which must be first depurated by the Body of the black Eagle, that it may be made beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and glorious above measure) and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury very well purged with Salt and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and strained through Leather, put it in purified <hi>Aquafortis,</hi> that all the Mercury may be dissolved, decant the <hi>Aquafortis</hi> from the Calx of <hi>Sol,</hi> wash the Calx as aforesaid in warm water, and dry it with a gentle heat, that Calx (if artificially and lightly reverberated, yet so that it flow not) will be converted into a most beautiful <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Gold that it may be reduced into the first Matter, or Mercury of Philosophers, is thus otherwise calcined, whereof <hi>Paracelsus,</hi> in his 7th Book of <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suscitation, declares, namely; that Metal must be calcined with revivified Mercury, by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercury with the Metal into a Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, digesting them together, till an <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game</hi>
