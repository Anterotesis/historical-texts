         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT your Petitioners having with grief obſerved both the Language of many Pamphlets and perſons of late times, againſt the Miniſters of Chriſt among us, and Petitions preferred to you againſt their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent maintenance, without any regard to the ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a fitter: and theſe pretending to the relief of the impoveriſhed Nation, as if they were the very ſenſe and language of the body of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: We cannot but ſuſpect, yea diſcern that there is a party that deſire and endeavour the ſubverſion of the Miniſtrie; yet have we hitherto remained ſilent, partly in hopes that they were ſo few and inconſiderable, as not to deſerve to be publikely taken notice of, and mentioned, to the diſhonour of our Nation: partly that we might not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt your weighty conſultations, but chiefly leſt we ſhould be miſ-inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to ſuſpect your fidelitie to the Miniſtrie, and conſequently to Chriſtianity and Chriſt himſelf: which we know you muſt needs reſent as an uncharitable cenſoriouſneſs, conſidering how evident you have ſeen, and how often acknowledged with greateſt ſolemnity, the Lord Jeſus in your preſervations; and how deeply you are engaged to him above moſt men on earth, and how ſenſibly you vindicated a perſecuted Miniſtrie in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning of this Parliament, and how ſtrongly you have obliged your ſelves, not only to preſerve the Reformed Religion in Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſcipline, and Government; but alſo to promote in all theſe a further reformation where it is wanting; as alſo conſidering what a tender reſpect to a faithful Miniſtrie you have all along to this day profeſſed, and are ſtill conſulting for the Propagation of the Goſpel, and have done Juſtice on ſome oppoſers ſo near you; beſides the augmentations you have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54088:3"/>
to many places where means was wanting. We diſclaim therefore all ſuch ungrateful cenſoriouſneſs, and thankfully acknowledge all your favors to the Miniſtrie and Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus, who is eaſily able to reward you, and ſee that you be no loſers by him and his Cauſe. But yet leaſt our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſilence ſhould ſeem to ſignifie our conſent to thoſe that would undo us, under pretence of releiving us; and leſt they be thought to ſpeak our ſenſe, leſt their audaciouſneſs encreaſe while none contradict them: and leſt we diſhonour our Nation in the eyes of the Chriſtian world, whileſt they think that the voice of theſe few is the common voice: and leſt your own hearts ſhould be overwhelmed with grief, not only to ſee ſuch a degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted people living under your Government; but alſo that ſo few gain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſay them, as if the Nation had loſt their love to the Goſpel: and that after ſuch light, profeſſion and engagements; and conſequently you may think they will prove an ungrateful people to you, who prove ſo ungrateful to the Lord their Saviour; We have therefore adventured on this bold enterpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and crave your patience, while we do with more then ordinary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity beſpeak you, ſeeing it is in the zeal of the Lord, for his glory, his Church, his Goſpel, and the ſouls of our ſelves and poſterity. We know it was by Miniſters of the Goſpel, that the Lord Jeſus did ſet up his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on earth, and hath ſubdued ſo much of the World to himſelf, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kingdom of Darkneſs, Paganiſm, Idolatry, and wickedneſs: we know he granted their Commiſſion upon the reception of his plenipotencie, and upon his aſcending he gave them for the perfecting of the Saints, and the edifying of his body, till they come to his fulneſs, and that as a means to preſerve them from Seducers, and being toſſed and carryed about as children with every wind of Doctrine, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 9. to 15. and hath promiſed to be with them to the end of the world: which promiſe he hath hitherto eminently accompliſhed. It is the Miniſtrie by which Chriſt hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his Church to this day: nor do we know, or have heard of that place on earth where Chriſtianity was ever maintained in ſplendor and vigor (if at all continued) without a Miniſtrie. It was the Miniſters by whom Chriſt did waken the ſuperſtitious world, and diſcover to them the Romiſh deluſions; and by whom he begun and carryed on the Work of Reformation, by them exciting a zealous Magiſtracie; and after all their labours, multitudes of them did ſacrifice their lives in the flames. It is the writings of a learned able Miniſtrie which yet ſtand up in the face of Heatheniſh, Mahometan, and Romiſh adverſaries, to their vexation and confuſion, which they may ſooner reproach or burn, then anſwer: by which after-ages are, and ſtill may be ſtabliſhed in the truth, againſt all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till endeavours of Seducers. It is a learned, able, faithful Miniſtrie, which yet is the daunting and diſcouragement of the Jeſuits and other deceivers,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54088:3"/>
who well know, if theſe were but taken out of their way, how boldly they might dare us, how inſultingly they might challenge us to diſpute for our Religion, and how eaſily they might ſilence and ſhame us, and thereby carry away the multitude after them. For who ſhould ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Peoples hearts, and defend the Cauſe of the LORD againſt them, if ſuch a Miniſtry were down? It was a faithfull Miniſtry who revealed Gods Mercy, and the precious Truths of the Goſpel to our own ſouls, and whom God by the Cooperation of his Spirit hath bleſſed to be the means of converting, or confirming, or both, the ſouls of all thoſe of us who have attained to any ſaving knowledge of himſelf. When we remember how often, and how happily our ſouls have been revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and refreſhed by their Miniſtry, we are aſhamed of the remiſneſs of our Zeal in this Cauſe; when we think that they are our Fathers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmers in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and how they muſt preſent us to him at his appearing as their Joy and Crown, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 19, 20. and that when we have eſcaped the flames of Hell, and meet them in glory, we muſt acknowledge them Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſo unvaluable a bleſſing; we had rather there were no tongues in our mouths, then that ever we ſhould joyn with their reproachers, and had rather ſuffer greater wants then ever we yet ſuffered, then ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deny them their neceſſary maintenance, ſeeing our Lord himſelf ſaid, when he ſet them upon his Work, <hi>The Labourer is worthy of his hire;</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Who goeth to warfare at his own charge? They that miniſter about holy things, live of the things of the Temple; even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. to 15. Conſidering alſo that they are not Forreigners, but <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen,</hi> our own Brethren, and Sons that receive it from us, even that which by Law is not ours but theirs; and conſidering alſo how much more liberal Papiſts are to their Maſs-Prieſts and ſeducing Jeſuits then we are to a faithfull Miniſtry of Chriſt. And when we conſider, that if <hi>England</hi> do excell other Nations in the light of knowledge, and power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it is the Miniſtry that are herein our glory, and the means of what the People do enjoy, we cannot be ſo ungratefull to them as to ſtarve them and caſt them off; nor yet ſuch enemies to <hi>Englands</hi> happineſs and honour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Lord; and how God hath broken thoſe powers that have diſobeyed and abuſed them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15, 16, 17. and how ſeverely he hath dealt in <hi>England</hi> before our eyes with that generation of men that ſilenced, reproached, and perſecuted them; we tremble at Gods Judgements, and dare not venter into the ſame conſuming fire, whoſe flames are yet ſo freſh in our memory.</p>
            <p>Your Petitioners having as in the preſence of the Lord made this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and ſolemn profeſſion of their Judgements, Affections, and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to acquaint you how far they are from approving or conſenting to any oppoſers or underminers of the Miniſtry and Goſpel of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> do humbly addreſs themſelves, with theſe earneſt requeſts, to this Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That you will be pleaſed, not only to continue your owning of, and tendereſt care for the upholding or an Able, Godly, Faithfull Miniſtry (of which we dare not doubt) but alſo that you will ſo far countenance and encourage them in the Lords Work, and diſcountenance all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, directly or indirectly that all the World, and eſpecially the People of this Common-wealth, may ſtill ſee, and acknowledge your open and reſolved adhering to the Reformed Chriſtian Religion, and Intereſt of the Lord Jeſus: and ſeeing all the ungodly (beſides miſguided diſtempered Chriſtians) are ever diſcouragers of them, God having ſent them on a Work ſo unpleaſing to fleſh and blood, you will the more ſedulouſly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, as nurſing Fathers of the Church.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that you will be pleaſed to this end, to take ſpecial care of their competent maintenance, that we may not have an ignorant Miniſtry, while they are forced to be labouring for food and raiment, while they ſhould be in their ſtudies, or watching over their flocks; and that through diſability or unpreparedneſs, they diſgrace not the work of Chriſt, nor make it and their office contemptible, thereby rejoycing the enemy, and hindring the ſaving of ſouls; ſpecially ſeeing it is expected that they credit their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with works of Charity: And ſeeing that a dependant and beggarly Miniſtry will loſe ſo much of their Authority with the ſouls that moſt need them, and themſelves will be laid open to the ſore temptation of Man-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; beſides the probability of the ſuffering of their children, when they are dead: And if the Miniſters of this Age be never ſo reſolved to continue their work through all neceſſities, yet in the next Age the Church is like to be deſtitute and deſolate, becauſe men will ſet their ſons to other ſtudies and imployments: We therefore humbly crave, that this Honorable Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly will not take down the preſent Maintenance by Tythes (though we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s much reaſon to be ſenſible of thoſe inconveniences that it is charged with,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54088:4"/>
as others) or at leaſt, not till they, inſtead of it, eſtabliſh as ſure, and full, and fit a Maintenance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That you will be pleaſed to take into your compaſſionate thoughts, both the dark places in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> which want able godly Teachers; and the ſtate of great Cities, and populous Towns, where through the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding number of ſouls, one Miniſter hath more work then can poſſibly be done by many: whereby while they are confined to the publike work alone, all private Miniſterial Inſtruction, Admonition, and other over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, muſt needs be neglected: That therefore to ſuch very numerous Congregations, you would allow a maintenance, if not to Miniſters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the number of ſouls, and greatneſs of the work; yet at leaſt more then in ſmaller places: We offer but the ſame requeſt to you, in your places, which Chriſt hath commanded us to offer to God himſelf.
