            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

voyde, the sayd <hi>Launay</hi> fledde to the Councell,
where disguising the fact, and against all truth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
them his proceedings had beene but by

way of seisure and attachment against the English,
and by right of some Letters of Mart, for a Ship
of his which hee pretended to haue beene taken
from him some nine yeares since by some English
Piratts, which he himselfe termeth to be such, in
whose taking, he pretended to haue lost some
1200. pound Sterling, and so making himselfe
a Plaintiffe, and requiring a discharge of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and imiginary Attachment, or extent of
the same goods. Wherevpon the parties being
called, and appearing before the Councell, the
sayd <hi>Launay</hi> (to giue a better collour to his cause)
did practise, and got the sayd late <hi>Helias Frute,</hi> a
Dutch Marchant, to ioyne and interpose himselfe
to him in this cause; the sayd <hi>Frute</hi> having beene
once Master of a Dutch Shippe, whereof Sir <hi>Iohn

calling, and intituling himselfe one of the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors

might be sold for his satisfaction, and repayment

in the pretended right of <hi>Helias Fruit</hi> decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

sayd criminall proceedings, and sentence of the
Iudge of the sayd <hi>Lesnevers,</hi> to the end that <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi>
might haue a discharge or release for his owne
goods, which were seized and extended by vertue
of the sayd sentence and Iudgement: whereupon
the said <hi>Launay</hi> and <hi>Marteau</hi> got so much fauour,
that although the English did proceed in the said
Councell but declinatorely (that is to say, standing
vpon exception, and refused to bee tryed by that
Court) desiring that the cause and parties might
be sent back into <hi>Brittaine,</hi> before the naturall and
ordinary Iudges, for execution of their former
Iudgements, and in case of Apeale if neede were
before the high Court of Parliament of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
            <p>Neverthelesse, without appointing that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
should ever write or enter into any proofes in
the maine cause or principall: yea, without so
much as hearing them at all theretn, the Priuie
Councell was pleased against all formes of Iustice,
to pronounce and enact their Decree in the maine
cause, the 27. of Ianuary, 1622. which Decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarying
and contradicting it selfe, doth award that
the whole criminal proceedings, should be brought
to the office of the Councell, to doe right vnto the
parties, according to reason: and in the meane
time the former sentences of death and banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to surcease, with full leaue and power to the
sayd <hi>Launay,</hi> to reside and dwell in the Countrey as
hee might haue done before those Iudgements,
yea with a generall discharge, and freedome for all
his goods seazed by vertue of them, of which the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27883:4"/>
Commissioners or Depositaries shall make him
iust account, and giue him the residue or surplus,
and without any regard to the sayd sentence of the
thirtith of October, 1620. whereby the English had
a discharge and a release of their Barke and goods,
they did order that without any preiudice or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance
to the maine cause and principall, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
prevent the decay and perishing of the wares,
both the wares and Barke should bee sould at Saint
<hi>Malloes,</hi> to the vttermost, and the price thereof put
into the hands of sufficient Marchants, on whom
the parties should agree before the Commissioner;
who should transport himselfe in those places, and
that as well the English parties, as their sureties,
and Depositaries should be constrained to represent
the sayd Barke and goods in paine of imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Against this so extraordinary Decree, both the
said English and French parties sought their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
by petition, as well because that Decree is
all formes and custome, because they did contest;
but declinatorily, and by way of exception: a
difficulty which was first to be discussed, and yet it
doth pronounce and decide at once vpon the main
and principall. Whereupon there was yet no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation:
as also that it is wholly contrary to it
selfe. First in so much as it being ordered, that the
whole criminall cause should bee brought, that
right might bee done vnto the parties accordingly,
if followeth, that there could no right be done to
them till it had beene brought and answered. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
is there any thing more contrary to it selfe,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:27883:4"/>
then to order that without preiudice to the right
of the parties, in the principall, and to prevent the
decay and perishing of the seazed goods, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any regarde to the sentence of the thirtith of
October, by which the English had got a discharge
and release of their owne goods and Barke, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
good and sufficient sureties. Now all those
things shall be sould, and the monies issuing out of
it, sequestered into the hands of sufficient men,
and that as well the English as their Sureties shall
be forced to represent all those old goods, euen
by restraint of their owne persons, or can there be
any more hurt or preiudice done to the English,
and French parties, then to force them meere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilities,
in representing that which was sould,
and gone a whole yeare before, by vertue of their
discharge and release, or else to force them to bring
backe againe and consigne the value of their owne
goods, and that the Commissioner shall transport
himselfe so farre, with great expence for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of all this: was it not sufficient that the
English had given Sureties, and was not that equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent
to an evaluation and consignation of the
price of the sayd goods, and what greater decay and
deperishing could happen more then the costs
and expenses, for the execution of the sayd Decree,
and the great losses and damages that the sayd
English haue suffered. For the Commissioners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to the place with <hi>Launay</hi> and <hi>Marteau,</hi>
and at their suite (who for their part confined not
any thing for the iourney) finding that the sayd
Barke and goods were no more to bee found, in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:27883:5"/>
stead of contenting themselues with their former
Sureties, and of a new supply of others, offered by
the said English, whereof hee should haue made
his report to the Councell, he caused out of hand
many other Ships to be seazed and stayed, laden
with store of marchandice, belonging as well to
the sayd English Marchants, as to diverse others
of ther nation, their Chambers to bee lockt and
sealed, hindering the transport of all marchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and causing all trade and commerce to cease,
during his aboad of sixe weekes long in the towne:
yea more, caused the sayd English and French Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and their Sureties to bee arrested and impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
for not representing of the sayd Barke and
goods, so that as well to redeeme themselues and
their Sureties, from the imprisonment of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and to procure their liberties againe, as also
to haue a release and discharge for those shippes
and goods newly seazed vpon, that were constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to suffer a new rate and valuation of their old
Barke and goods, to bee made to the smmme of
1854. pound sterling, and to deposet the sayd sum
(though most impertinent) seeing the first estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of the goods alone, was 1714. pound
sterling, and that the interest of <hi>Launay</hi> in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
losse, by the English Pirate was by himselfe
claymed to be but 1200. pound sterling. Now vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this summe of 1854. pound, the Commissioner
tooke some 300. for fees and taxations, as well for
himselfe, his Clarke, and Register in the said Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
as for the Counsellors, and Atturneys of
the parties, &amp; even for those of <hi>Launay</hi> and <hi>Marteau:</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:27883:5"/>
yea, for the very Sergeents which were imployed
for the imprisoning of men, seazure and sale of the
goods of one <hi>William Baskrvile,</hi> lately deceased, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the English partners, which goods were
sould for the said consignation, by this meanes the
Commissioner caused onely the English to beare
the burden, notwithstanding all their former losses
almost inestimable, which amount to more then
5000. pound sterling, onely in this last seazure and
retention of their ships, discontinuation and cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of trade and Commerce, which rigorous kind
of proceeding did so seaze the heart of poore <hi>Bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kervile,</hi>
one of the most interressed in the businesse
among the parties, that hee dyed for the meere
griefe of it, within two dayes, as is witnessed by the
very report of the Commissioner, who vpon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of the rest of the English, had sent backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
all the parties to the Priuy Councell. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
to witnesse the lawfulnes of their iust plants,
and the whole truth of all the premises, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
haue caused the sayd criminall cause and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
against <hi>Launay</hi> and his complicies, to bee
brought, together with the report and relation of
of the sayd Commissiouer, which doth proue and
iustifie all that which is aforesayd, and shewes that
the fact of <hi>Launay</hi> and his Complices, is but a meer
robbery and pyracy, not any action of Mart or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisall,
and that the sayd Decree of the Counsell,
with the execution thereof, hath been such a great
and notorious hurt and damage to the English, as
it cannot bee coloured nor maintained. Moreover,
to prooue that this robbery cannot by any meanes
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:27883:6"/>
be cloaked with any title of Mart, or reprisall. The
English doe represent three things.</p>
            <p>First, The Peace and Amitie betweene the two
Kings, during which, and the libertie of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
and Trade; it is an absurd and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing, to talke of Mart or reprisall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They produce the Articles of Peace,
agreed vpon betweene their Maiesties, whereby
it is most specially concluded, That all Letters of
Mart and Reprisall, which before then had beene
graunted by any of the two Kings, shall absolutely
surcease, without being put to any execution, as
well of one side as of the other, and that for the
time to come, there shall not any more be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but that the Ambassadours shall respectiuely
haue warning of it before hand, and those Letters
be seene and well considered in the Councell of
both Princes, sealed with their great seales, and
generally, all the solemnities in such case required
be well observed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Launay,</hi> and his complices cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
any right of Reprisall, since they are not bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of, nor vpheld with any such Letters at all,
granted either with any of the former solemnities,
nor in any other manner howsoever, so that this
fact cannot otherwise be called, but meere robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and pyracy, for all these reasons, therefore the
sayd English doe conclude, and require by their
said Petition, that the sayd Decree of the Councell
of the twentie-seaventh of Ianuary last, and all that
therevpon is ensued, bee altogether revoked, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheired,
and disanulled, and in stead thereof awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:27883:6"/>
that the said summe of 1854. pound Sterling,
which they haue beene constrained to deposet, as
well for their liberties, and their Suerties, as for the
release of their Shippes and goods seazed, and from
them detayned, shall be wholly restored vnto them,
as well by the said <hi>Launay</hi> and <hi>Marteau,</hi> as by their
Serieants, Advocates, Attorneyes, Depositaries,
and others, which haue any wayes touched any
part of it, every one according to their severall rates
and portions, and so doing it may be ordered, that
the Depositaries and Snerties shall remaine fully
free, and altogether discharged, as also the sayd
<hi>Launay,</hi> and his complices, with <hi>Marteau</hi> and his
partners, condemned in all the cost, damage, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
of the sayd both English and French Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
and so all with <hi>Launay,</hi> and his complices
sent backe againe; before such Royall Iudges in
those places, as his Maiestie will be pleased to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt,
for the execution of their said former sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
and Iudgements, as well Criminall as Civill,
of the sayd Iudge of <hi>Lesnevers,</hi> with reservation of
Appeale, (if need be) to the high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in <hi>Brittany.</hi>
