         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He cruelty of thoſe inſatiate vultures
the Cavaliers has been ſo abundantly
teſtified through moſt part of this
kingdome, that many hundred of
poore wretches with daily execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
curſe their violence, which has in
no place been extended with more
rigour then at the two good Townes
of Abington and Alisbury, ſiſters in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity,
only Alisbury appeares the elder, having preceded
Abington ſome dayes in her misfortune. Alisbury a very Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Towne in Buckingham ſhire, ſtill loyall to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
whither about ſome five dayes ſince, a thouſand
of the Cavaliers, all Troopers, came Commiſſary <hi>Wilmot</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62863:3"/>
being their Commander in chiefe under Count <hi>Robert,</hi>
who was not there in perſon. Well, thither they came,
and billetted themſelves for that night in the beſt Innes,
and other houſes of quality about the towne, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
indifferent courteouſly entertain'd by the Inhabitants of
<hi>Alisbury,</hi> more for feare then love, they hoping by their
friendly uſage to mollifie their ſavage diſpoſition of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome
gueſts, who they knew were apt for all miſchiefes
men durſt attempt, caring neither for God nor the Divell,
But, as ſayes the Poet:
<q>
                  <l>Quo ſemel est imbuta recens ſervabit odorem</l>
                  <l>teſta Diu.—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It was impoſſible to alter the cuſtomary proceedings of
the Cavaliers, which is reſulted into a ſecond nature, their
rapine and theft, ſeeming as individuall to them, as if it were
their inſeparable eſſence.</p>
            <p>In the morning therefore theſe violaters of all divine and
humane Lawes, began to put in act all their determined pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,
and every one to fall upon the houſe that he was har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
in, which in moſt outragious and inhumane manner
was expoſed a prey to their ravenous appetites, neither the
intreaties of men, the teares and prayers of women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
being ſufficient to perſwade remorſe into theſe demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divells;
in an inſtant you might have ſeene all that good
towne in a confuſion and uproare; the money, plate, pewter,
braſſe, and all things that were of worth or portable, being
ſnapt up by their violence, and all other houſhold-ſtuffe
which was not for it's waight or bigneſſe fit to be carryed
away, being ſpoyl'd and made uſeleſſe; ſome you might have
ſeen cutting Bedſteads in pieces, ſome unripping the Beds,
and caſting abroad and trampling on the feathers that the
night before gave eaſe to their ungracious bodies, divers
hewing Tables, and pulling downe the very waneſcot which
they caſt into the Chimney, making that which before was
an ornament to the roome, a fire to warme the naked walls:
hangings which were not of much worth, running the ſame
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62863:3"/>
deſtiny, thoſe of Arras they pack'd up, intending to make ſale
of them with the next opportunity; nor did their barbarous
cruelty end here, the very cattell in the ſtalls and adjoyning
yards, as Cowes, and the like, they hough'd, or ſhot to
death with their Carabines and Petronels: divers of them in
their beaſtly and libidinous fury, offering violence to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Matrons and beautifull Virgins, but therein they met
ſtout reſiſtance, divers of the women couragiouſly reſiſting
their attemps, and ſome ſheathing their Knives and Spits
in the bowells of theſe miſcreants, more ſavage then the
Turks themſelves: the towneſmen ſeeing all things goe thus
to ruine, their houſes, goods and cattell, nay, their wives and
children undone before their faces, and of the train'd bands
comming into them from the neighbouring townes and
Hamlets, began to pull up their courages and reſiſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers,
who buſie about their prey, had no thought of being
ſurprized or aſſaulted, but they had reckon'd, it ſeemes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Hoſtes, who reſolv'd to make them pay part of the
reckoning with their lives, falling therefore upon by parties
in the ſeverall houſes where they were acting their villanies
with Muſquets, Pikes, Pitchforkes, and what weapons they
could poſſibly get, the Cavaliers amaz'd, and finding it no
buſineſſe to be ſlighted, began to draw together into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for the defence of themſelves and their unlawfull-gotten
purchaſe of Money and Plate, leaving all the reſt, as Braſſe,
Pewter, and the like; divers alſo minding their prey they
were poſſeſs'd of, more then the ſafty of their companions,
got out to their horſes, and rid away as faſt as they could; ſo
that of a thouſand of them not above foure hundred got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
into the Market-place, where the towneſmen and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagers
with their Pikes and Muſquets aſſaulted them ſo hotly,
that they tumbled above a ſcore of them from their horſes,
their Commanders ſeeing the ſervice grow hot, and that
the Countrey ſtill came in upon them, were cautious of ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any longer in that place, and therefore turn'd faces about,
and putting ſpurres to their horſes, fled out of the towne as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62863:4"/>
faſt they could, all of them not ſcaping befitting puniſhment
(if death can be a ſufficient puniſhment for ſuch Monſters)
for the men of the towne following them as faſt as they
could through the ſtreets, diſcharg'd their Muſquets with
ſo good aime, that they ſlew neere fifty more; thus God in
his great mercy delivered that good towne from the fury of
thoſe deſperate Malignants, and turn'd their miſchiefe upon
their owne heads; the greateſt damage the towneſmen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,
being in the loſſe of their Money and Plate, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was no great nor conſiderable ſumme: the wealthy
men of that towne, ever ſince the arrivall of the Cavaliers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the parts thereabouts keeping no Plate at all, or very little
in their houſes, and no more Mony then what ſerv'd for their
domeſtique expences; ſo that the Cavaliers, conſidering the
men they loſt, had no great reaſon to boaſt of their purchaſe.
While theſe miſchievous Malignants were acting this cruell
outrage at <hi>Alisbury,</hi> other birds of the ſame feather, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Belial,</hi> under the command of Count <hi>Robert,</hi> were
performing the like abominable outrages in and about the
good towne of <hi>Abington,</hi> where Prince <hi>Robert</hi> comming
with his Cavaliers, to a Gentlemans houſe of good quality
and much wealth, if I miſtake not, the Gentleman was call'd
Maſter <hi>Aſhcombe,</hi> plundred it without all mercy, uſing the
good old Gentleman very deſpiteouſly, taking away at leaſt
two thouſand pounds in money, part of which, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
Prince <hi>Robert</hi> reſtored backe to the Gentlemans
daughters, for portions, perhaps that bountie being but the
hand to ſome ſiniſter ends hee had upon their chaſtities.
From hence they came into the towne of <hi>Abington,</hi> ſixe
miles from <hi>Oxford</hi> and there billetted themſeves, where
they had moſt minde to take up their lodgings, forcing their
Land-lords to provide them what dainties their luxuries had
moſt minde to, or that the towne could yeeld them. The
poore towneſmen willing to pleaſe them, as they of <hi>Alisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
in hope their courteſie might provoke them to courteous
uſage, had the ſame deſtiny which <hi>Alisbury</hi> had, the next
morning the greedy and inſatiate Cavaliers, by the permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62863:4"/>
at leaſt, if not commiſſion from their Generall, began
their accuſtomed worke of plundring by degrees, that
ſo the miſery of the towneſmen might the longer laſt,
taking from them at firſt onely their Money all that they
could poſſible lay hands on, pretending that they wanted
their pay from the King, who had no Money, and that
it was fit they ſhould be ſatisfied of ſome body, none
fitter then they, who, as they term'd them, were Malignants
and Roundheads. The poore towneſmen being unable to
make reſiſtance, ſeem'd willing enough to part with their
moneys, thinking they would not offer to deprive them
of their goods; but when they had rioted away their
coine, loſing one to another at Dice, then they fell to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
the houſes, all the beſt furniture and ornaments, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Pewter, Braſſe, or the like being ſtraight ſeaſed
on by thoſe that had debauch'd away their money, and
carryed to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and there made ſale of: divers of the
towneſmen ſtand to compound for their goods, giving them
a conſiderable ſumme of Money in lieu of them, which
they tooke with a thouſand dammees, ſwearing not to
meddle with them, but their money was no ſooner ſpent
(and it alwayes burn'd in their pockets bottomes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Proverbe) but preſently, not regarding their
oaths and hideous proteſtations, fell preſently a rifling
againe, ſome of the owners ranſoming their goods twice
or thrice from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe thieves, at laſt were forc'd to part
with them in ſpight of their teeths; the Pewter, Braſſe,
and ſuch portable mettall commodities being all gone,
they proceeded to other houſhold ſtuffe, as Beds and
Curtaines, rugs and hangings, and the like: they made
ſpoyle alſo of Tables, Chayres and Stooles, not leaving
any Inhabitant any thing of value in their houſes but the
houſes themſelves, which if they could have made ſale of
or carried away, would not have eſcaped their all-devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
fingers; ſo that the towne of <hi>Abington</hi> is in a moſt
diſtreſſed eſtate, plundred by theſe inſatiate Cavaliers, who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62863:5"/>
like a conſuming fire deſtroy all before them whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they come; being indeed, as it was antiently ſaid by
the <hi>Italians</hi> of <hi>Attila</hi> and his <hi>Huns,</hi> the very ſcourges of
God for our offences. Heaven deliver all good people
from the hands of ſuch prodigies, and ſend them their
deſerv'd reward the Gallowes, which, according to the
Proverbe, grones for them, and then wee ſhould, no
doubt, have a faire accord betweene his Majeſty and his
high Court of Parliament, which God preſerve.</p>
