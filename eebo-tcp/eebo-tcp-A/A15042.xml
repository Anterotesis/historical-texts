            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

One of the chiefe of the seauen wonders of the world, was the sumptuous sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre of king <hi>Mausolus,</hi> which his louing wife <hi>Artimisia</hi> caused to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected: and in aduantage, she hyred with rich rewardes the most famous Poets of Grece to register his life &amp; vertues. The performing of these louing and naturall dueties is the cause, that the memory of so many famous men (long since ingraued) is at this day so fresh, and to posteritie the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to vertue so great. And to say the truth, the Cronicles of good mens actes, are the guydes of wel doing: on the other side, the blaming of vitious deedes, is the bridle of euill attempts. The noble Emperor <hi>Alexander</hi> called <hi>Seuerus,</hi> would often times say, that his firmest motions to do well proceeded of this cause, that <hi>Historiographers</hi> should write well of him, by the warrant of good desart, and furthermore hee feared to iniury any wryter, lest he should defame him through a froward and malicious disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Your Honorable Lordship in solemnising most sumptuously the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of the thrise noble Lord and your deare brother, the late Earle of <hi>Sussex,</hi> fully assureth the world, that you regarded his worthinesse farre more then his wealth. And to giue him his right, the full report of his vertues, would be a taske as troublesome, as to gase against the Sunne paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But for that in greatest things, it sufficeth to show a good will: Much moued by the passion of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sorrow for the death of so gracious a Lord, but farre more by the generall bruite of his diuine and heroicall vertues: I haue written this small remembrance of his mightie merits, no better gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, then precious stones set in brasse: protesting that I onely haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
