            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Have seldome known a Trick succeed,
and will put none upon the Reader, But
tell him plainly that I think it could
never be more seasonable than now to lay
down such Rules, as if they be observ'd,
will make Men write more Correctly, and
judge more discreetly; But <hi>Horace</hi> must be
read seriously or not at all, for else the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
wont be the better for him, and I shall
have lost my labour, I have kept as close as I
could, both to the Meaning, and the Words
of the Author, and done nothing but what I
believe he would forgive if he were alive;
And I have often ask'd my self that Question.
I know this is a Field</p>
            <p>Per quem Magnus Equos <hi>Arunci</hi> flexit
Alumnus.</p>
            <p>But with all the respect due to the name of <hi>Ben.
<pb facs="tcp:49758:3"/>
Johnson,</hi> to which no Man pays more Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than I, it cannot be deny'd that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of Rhyme, and a literal Translation
(to which <hi>Horace</hi> in this Book declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
an Enemy) has made him want a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in many places.</p>
            <p>My chief care has been to Write intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly,
and where the Latin was Obscure, I
have added a Line or two to explain it.</p>
            <p>I am below the Envy of the Criticks, but if
I durst, I would begg them to remember, that
<hi>Horace</hi> ow'd his favour and his fortune to
the Character given of him by <hi>Virgil</hi> and
<hi>Varius,</hi> that <hi>Fundanius &amp; Pollio</hi> are still
valued by what <hi>Horace</hi> says of them, and
that in their Golden Age, there was a good
Vnderstanding among the Injenious, and
those who were the most Esteem'd were the
best Natur'd.</p>

            <l>Gives us a pattern in his flowing Stile,</l>
            <l>And with rich Precepts do's oblige our Isle,</l>

               <hi>Brittain,</hi> whose Genious is in Verse exprest</l>
            <l>Bold and sublime, but negligently drest;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:49758:4"/>
               <hi>Horace</hi> will our superfluous Branches prune,</l>
            <l>Give us new rules, and set our Harp in tune,</l>
            <l>Direct us how, to back the winged Horse,</l>
            <l>Favour his flight, and moderate his force;</l>
            <l>Tho' Poets may of Inspiration boast.</l>
            <l>Their Rage ill govern'd, in the Clouds is lost;</l>
            <l>He that proportion'd wonders can disclose,</l>
            <l>At once his Fancy and his Judgment shows;</l>
            <l>Chast moral Writing we may learn from hence</l>
            <l>Neglect of which no wit can recompence;</l>
            <l>The Fountain which from <hi>Helicon</hi> proceeds,</l>
            <l>That sacred Stream should never water weeds,</l>
            <l>Nor make the Crop of thorns and thistles grow</l>
            <l>Which Envy or perverted Nature sow;</l>
            <l>Well-sounding Verses are the Charm we use,</l>
            <l>Heroick thoughts, and vertue to infuse;</l>
            <l>Things of deep sence we may in Prose unfold,</l>
            <l>But they move more, in lofty numbers told;</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:49758:4"/>
By the loud Trumpet, which our Courage aids,</l>
            <l>We learn that sound, as well as sence, persuades,</l>
            <l>The Muse's friend, unto himself severe,</l>
            <l>With silent pitty looks on all that Err,</l>
            <l>But where a brave, a publick Action shines</l>
            <l>That he rewards with his Immortal Lines;</l>
            <l>Whether it be in Counsel or in Fight,</l>
            <l>His Countrey's Honour is his chief delight;</l>
            <l>Praise of great Acts, he scatters as a seed,</l>
            <l>Which may the like, in coming Ages breed:</l>
            <l>Here taught the sate of Verses, always priz'd</l>
            <l>With admiration, or as much despis'd,</l>
            <l>Men will be less indulgent to their fauts</l>
            <l>And patience have to cultivate their thoughts;</l>
            <l>Poets lose half the praise they should have got,</l>
            <l>Could it be known, what they discreetly blot</l>
            <l>Finding new words, that to the ravish't Ear</l>
            <l>May like the Language of the Gods appear,</l>

Such as of old, wise Bards employ'd, to make</l>

            <l>Law-giving-Heroes, fam'd for taming Bru'ts,</l>
            <l>And raising Cities with their Charming Lutes,</l>
            <l>For rudest minds, with Harmony were caught,</l>
            <l>And civil Life was by the Muses taught,</l>
            <l>So wandring Bees would perish in the Air,</l>
            <l>Did not a sound, proportion'd to their Ear,</l>
            <l>Appease their rage, invite them to the Hive,</l>
            <l>Unite their force, and teach them how to thrive</l>
            <l>To rob the flowers, and to forbear the spoil,</l>
            <l>Preserv'd in Winter by their Summers toyl,</l>

               <l>Swells with the praises which he gives himself;</l>
               <l>And taking Sanctuary in the Croud,</l>

               <l>A wealthy Poet, takes more pains to hire,</l>
               <l>A flatring Audience, than poor Tradesmen do</l>
               <l>To persuade Customers to buy their goods.</l>
               <l>Tis hard to find a Man of great Estate,</l>
               <l>That can distinguish flatterers from Friends.</l>
               <l>Never delude your self, nor read your Book</l>
               <l>Before a brib'd and fawning Auditor;</l>
               <l>For hee'l commend and feign an Extasie,</l>
               <l>Grow pale or weep, do any thing to please;</l>
               <l>True friends appear less mov'd than Counterfeit;</l>
               <l>As men that truly grieve at Funerals,</l>
               <l>Are not so loud, as those that cry for hire;</l>
               <l>Wise were the Kings, who never chose a Friend</l>
               <l>Till with full Cups they had unmask'd his Soul,</l>

And seen the bottom of his deepest thoughts;</l>
               <l>You cannot arm your self with too much care</l>
               <l>Against the smiles of a designing Knave.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Quintilius</hi> (if his advice were ask'd)</l>
               <l>Would freely tell you what you should correct,</l>
               <l>Or (if you could not) bid you blot it out,</l>
               <l>And with more care supply the vacancy;</l>
               <l>But if he found you fond, and obstinate</l>
               <l>(And apter to defend than mend your faults)</l>
               <l>With silenc leave you to admire your self,</l>
               <l>And without Rival hugg your darling Book.</l>
               <l>The prudent care of an Impartial friend,</l>
               <l>Will give you notice of each idle Line,</l>
               <l>Shew what sounds harsh, &amp; what wants ornament,</l>
               <l>Or where it is too lavishly bestowed;</l>
               <l>Make you explain all that he finds Obscure,</l>
               <l>And with a strict Enquiry mark your faults;</l>
               <l>Nor for these trifles fear to loose your love;</l>

Those things, which now seem frivolous, &amp; slight,</l>
               <l>Will be of serious consequence to you,</l>
               <l>When they have made you once Ridiculous.</l>
               <l>A Mad Dogs foam, the infection of the Plague,</l>
               <l>And all the Judgments of the angry Gods,</l>
               <l>We are not all more heedfully to shun,</l>
               <l>Then Poetasters in their raging fits,</l>
               <l>Follow'd and pointed at by Fools and Boys;</l>
               <l>But dreaded and proscrib'd by Men of sense:</l>
               <l>If (in the Raving of a frantick Muse)</l>
               <l>And minding more his Verses than his Way,</l>
               <l>Any of these should drop into a Well,</l>
               <l>Tho he might burst his lungs to call for help,</l>
               <l>No Creature would assist or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pitty him,</l>
               <l>But seem to think he fell on purpose in.</l>
               <l>Hear how an old <hi>Sicilian</hi> Poet died;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Empedocles,</hi> mad to be thought a God,</l>
               <l>In a cold fit leap'd into <hi>AEtna's</hi> flames.</l>

Give Poets leave to make themselves away,</l>
               <l>Why should it be a greater sin to kill,</l>
               <l>Then to keep Men alive against their will?</l>
               <l>Nor was this chance; But a deliberate choice;</l>
               <l>For if <hi>Empedocles</hi> were now reviv'd,</l>
               <l>He would be at his Frolick once again,</l>
               <l>And his pretensions to Divinity:</l>
               <l>Tis hard to say whether for Sacrilege</l>
               <l>Or Incest, or some more unhear'd of Crime</l>
               <l>The Rhyming Fiend is sent into these Men,</l>
               <l>But they are all most visibly possest,</l>
               <l>And like a baited Bear, when he breaks loose,</l>
               <l>Without distinction seize on all they meet;</l>
               <l>None ever scap'd that came within their reach,</l>
               <l>Sticking like Leaches till they burst with blood,</l>
               <l>Without remorse insatiably they read,</l>
               <l>And never leave till they have read Men dead.</l>
