            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is not from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of ſuch worth in my
labors, that they durst
looke ſo hye. A lower Patronage
would haue ſerued an hyer work.
<pb facs="tcp:3800:3"/>
It were well, if ought of mine
could bee worthie of popular
eyes. Or if I could wring ought
from my ſelfe, not vnworthie
of a iudicious Reader; I knowe
your Highneſſe wants neither
preſents, nor counſells: preſents
from strangers, counſells from
your teachers; neither of them
matcheable by my weakeneſse:
Only duty herein excuſes mee
from preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For, I thought
it iniustice to deuote the fruite
of my labour, to any other hand
beſide my Maisters: which alſo
I knewe to bee as gratious, as
mine is faithfull. Yet (ſince euen
<pb facs="tcp:3800:3"/>
good affections cannot warrant
too much vileneſſe in gifts to
Princes) leſt while my modeſty
diſparages my worke, I ſhould
hazard the acceptation; heere
ſhall your Grace finde varietie,
not without profite. I hate a
Diuine, that would but pleaſe;
and, withall, thinke it impoſsible
for a man to profit, that pleaſeth
not. And if, while my ſtile fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it ſelfe vpon others, any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
profite ſhall reflect vpon
your H. how happie am I! who
ſhall euer thinke, I haue liued to
purpoſe, if (by the beſt of my stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
I ſhall have done any good
<pb facs="tcp:3800:4"/>
office to your Soule. Further
(which theſe times account not
the least prayſe) your Grace ſhal
herein perceiue a new faſhion of
diſcourſe, by Epistles; new to
our language, vſual to others: and
(as Noueltie is neuer without
ſome plea of vſe) more free, more
familiar. Thus, we do but talke
with our friends by our pen, and
expreſse our ſelues no whit leſse
eaſily; ſome-what more dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stedly.</p>
            <p>Whatſoeuer it is, as it cannot
be good enough to deſerue that
countenance; ſo, the countenance
of ſuch Patronage ſhall make it
<pb facs="tcp:3800:4"/>
worthie of reſpect from others.
The God of Princes protect
your perſon, perfect your graces,
and giue you as much fauour in
heauen, as you haue honour on
earth.</p>

Thoſe, that are newly come from a

               <p>Alas! what ſhall wee looke-for of

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, my tongue, my
penne, and my heart,
are all your ſeruants;
when you cannot heare
mee, through diſtance,
you muſt ſee me in my Letters. You
are now in the Senate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or in the concourſe of the City,
or perhaps (tho more rarely) in the
royal face of the Court. All of them,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3800:11"/>
places fit for your place. From all
theſe, let mee call off your minde to
her home aboue; and, in the midſt
of buſineſſe, ſhowe you reſt: If I may
not rather commend, then admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
and before-hand confeſſe my
counſell ſuperfluous, becauſe your
holy forwardneſſe hath preuented it.
You can afford theſe, but halfe of
your ſelfe: The better part is better
beſtowed; Your ſoule is ſtill retired,
and reſerued. You haue learned to
vouchſafe theſe worldly things, vſe,
without affection; and knowe to
diſtinguiſh wiſely, betwixt a Stoicall
dulneſſe, and a Chriſtian contempt: &amp;
haue long made the world, not your
God, but your ſlaue. And, in truth
(that I may looſe my ſelfe into a bold
and free diſcourſe) what other reſpect
is it worthy of? I would adore it on
my face, if I could ſee any Maieſtie,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3800:11"/>
that might commaund veneration.
Perhaps, it loues me not ſo much, as
to ſhowe me his beſt. I haue ſought it
enough: And haue ſeene what others
haue doted on; and wondred at their
madneſſe. So may I look to ſee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things aboue, as <hi>I</hi> neuer could
ſee ought heere, but vanitie &amp; vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>What is fame, but ſmoke? and
metall, but droſſe? and pleaſure, but
a pill in ſuger? Let ſom gallants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
this, as the voice of a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike
ſcholler: <hi>I</hi> ſpeake that which
they ſhall feele, and ſhall confeſſe.
Tho <hi>I</hi> neuer was ſo, <hi>I</hi> haue ſeen ſom
as happy, as the worlde could make
them: and yet I neuer ſaw any more
diſcontented. Their life hath beene
neither longer, nor ſweeter, nor their
heart lighter, nor their meales harti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
nor their nights quieter, nor their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3800:12"/>
cares fewer, nor their complaints.
Yea, wee haue knowen ſome, that
haue loſt their mirth when they haue
found wealth; and at once haue cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be merrie and poore. All theſe
earthly delights, if they were ſound,
yet how ſhort they are! and if they
could be long, yet how vnſound! If
they were ſound, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are but as a
good day betweene two agues, or a
ſunne-ſhine betwixt two tempeſts.
And if they were long, their hony is
exceeded by their gall. This ground
beares none but maples, hollow, and
fruitleſſe; or, like the bankes of the
dead ſea, a faire apple, which vnder a
red ſide containes nothing but duſt.
Euery flower in this garden either
prickes, or ſmells ill. If it be ſweet, it
hath thornes: and if it haue no thorns,
it annoies vs with an ill ſent. Go then,
ye wiſe idolatrous Paraſites, &amp; erect
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3800:12"/>
ſhrines, and offer ſacrifices to your
God, the World; and ſeeke to pleaſe
him with your baſe and ſeruile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions:
It ſhall be long enough ere
ſuch religion ſhall make you happy.
You ſhall at laſt forſake thoſe altars,
empty and ſorrowfull. How eaſie is
it for vs Chriſtians, thus to inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the worldling, that thinkes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
worthy of enuie? How eaſie to
turne off the World with a ſcornefull
repulſe; and when it makes vs the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels
proffer, <hi>All theſe will I giue thee,</hi>
to returne <hi>Peters</hi> anſwer, <hi>Thy ſiluer
&amp; thy gold periſh with thee?</hi> How eaſie
to accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t none ſo miſerable, as thoſe
that are rich with iniurie, and growe
great by being conſcious of ſecret e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils?
Wealth and honor, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it coms
vpon the beſt terms, is but vain; but,
when vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ill conditions, burdenſom.
When they are at the beſt, they are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3800:13"/>
ſcarce friends; but, when at the worſt,
tormentors. Alas! how ill agrees a
gay coate, and a feſtered heart? what
auailes an high title, with an hell in
the ſoule? <hi>I</hi> admire the faith of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:</hi>
but, preſuppoſing his faith, <hi>I</hi>
wonder not at his choice. He prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the afflictions of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to the
pleaſures of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and choſe rather
to eate the Lambe, with ſowre herbs,
then all their fleſh-pots: For, how
much better is it to be miſerable then
guilty? and what compariſon is ther
betwixt ſorrow and ſinne? <hi>If</hi> it were
poſsible, let mee bee rather in hell
without ſinne, then on earth wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
glorious. But, how much are wee
bound to God, that allowes vs earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
fauours, without this oppoſition!
That GOD hath made you at once
honourable and iuſt, and your life
pleaſant and holy, and hath giuen you
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3800:13"/>
an high ſtate with a good heart; are
fauours, that looke for thanks. Theſe
muſt bee acknowledged, not reſted
in: They are yet higher thoughts
that muſt perfect your contentment.</p>
               <p>What God hath giuen you, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to that he meanes to giue: He
hath beene liberall; but, hee will be
munificent. This is not ſo much as
the taſte of a full cup. Faſten your
eyes vpon your future glory, and ſee
how meanly you ſhall eſteeme theſe
earthly graces. Here, you command
but a little pittance of mould (great
indeede, to vs; little, to the whole):
there, whole heauen ſhall bee yours.
Heere you commaund, but as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect:
there you ſhall raigne as a King.
Heere, you are obſerued; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with your iuſt diſtaſte: There,
you ſhall raigne with peace, and ioy.
Heere, you are noble among men;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3800:14"/>
there, glorious amongſt Angels.
Here, you want not honour; but you
want not croſſes: there, is nothing
but felicity. Here, you haue ſome
ſhort ioyes: there, is nothing but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.
You are a ſtranger, heere;
there, at home. Here, Satan tempts
you, and men vexe you: there, Saints
and Angels ſhall applaud you; and
God ſhall fill you with himſelfe. In a
word, you are onely bleſſed here, for
that you ſhall be.</p>
               <p>Theſe are thoughts worthy of
greatneſſe: which, if we ſuffer either
imployments, or pleaſures to thruſt
out of our doores, wee doe wilfully
make our ſelues comfortleſſe. Let
theſe ſtill ſeaſon your mirth, &amp; ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
your ſorrowes, &amp; euer interpoſe
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues betwixt you &amp; the world.

of Nature where
Grace is; and to magnifie
Grace, where it is at once
had, and affected. It is a fault of
Nature, and not the leaſt, that as ſhe
hath dim eies, ſo they are miſ-placed.
Shee lookes ſtill, either forward, or
downward; forward to the obiect ſhe
deſires, or downward to the meanes:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3800:15"/>
Neuer turnes her eyes either back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to ſee what ſhe was; or vpward,
to the cauſe of her good: Whence, it is
iuſt with God to with-hold what hee
would giue, or to curſe that which he
beſtowes; and to beſot carnall minds
with outward things, in their value, in
their deſire, in their vſe: Whereas
true wiſedome hath cleare eyes, and
right ſet; and therefore ſees an inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
hand in all ſenſible euents, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
all things, directing all things to
their due end; ſees on whom to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
whom to thanke. Earth is too
lowe, and too baſe, to giue bounds
vnto a ſpirituall ſight. No man then
can truely knowe what belongs to
wealth, or honour, but the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
either how to compaſſe them,
or how to prize them, or how to vſe
them. I care not how manie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
wayes there are to ſeeming ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

beſides this of vertue: they
all (if more) ſtill leade to ſhame: Or
what plots are deuiſed to improue
it; if they were as deepe as hell, yet
their end is loſſe. As there is no
counſell againſt God: ſo there is no
honour without him. Hee enclines
the hearts of Princes to fauour; the
hearts of inferiours to applauſe.
Without him, the hand cannot
moue, to ſucceſſe; nor the tongue,
to praiſe: And what is honour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
theſe? In vaine doth the world
frowne vpon the man, whom hee
meanes to honour; or ſmile, where
hee would diſgrace. Let mee then
tell your L. who are fauorites in the
Court of heauen; euen whiles they
wander on earth: Yea, let the great
King himſelfe tell you, <hi>Thoſe that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
mee, I will honour.</hi> That men
haue the grace to giue honour to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3800:16"/>
God, is an high fauour: but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
men giue honour to God (as
their duty) that therfore God ſhould
giue honour to men, is to giue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hee hath giuen. It is a fauour of
God, that man is honoured of man
like himſelfe: but, that God allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of our endeuours as honour
to himſelfe, is a greater fauour
then that vvherewith hee requires
it.</p>
               <p>This is the goodneſſe of our God:
The man that ſerues him, honours
him: and whoſoeuer honours him
with his ſeruice, is crowned with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
I challenge all times, places,
perſons: who euer honour'd God,
and was neglected? VVho wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

Turne-ouer all Records;

all godleſſe plots, in their looſe,

puniſhed their Author. I goe no
further: Your owne breſt knowes,
that your happie experience can
heerein iuſtifie GOD. The world
hath noted you, for a follower of
vertue; and hath ſeene howe faſt
Honour followed you: VVhiles you
ſought fauour with the GOD of
heauen, hee hath giuen you fauour
with his Deputie on earth.</p>
               <p>Gods former actions are pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes
of his future: Hee teaches
you what hee will doe, by what
hee hath done. Vnleſſe your hand
be wearie of offering ſeruice, hee
cannot either pull-in his hand from
rewarding, or hold it out empty. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
him ſtill, and God pawnes his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3800:17"/>
honour, on not failing you. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſtruſt him, whom your proofe
hath found faithfull. And, whiles
you ſettle your heart in this right

out-reach God, and ſeize vpon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

but a foote-ſtoole to the ſeat of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement;
which care for all things
but heauen, which make the worlde
their ſtanding marke; and doe not ſo

               <p>A falſe method is the bane of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
hopefull endeuours. God bids

vs ſeek firſt his kingdome; and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

if ſhe light on God by the waie, it is
more then ſhe expects, deſires, cares
for; and therfore failes of both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe ſeekes neither aright. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
had been great, if they had cared
to bee good; which now are croſſed
in what they woulde, becauſe they
willed not what they ought. If <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
had made wealth his firſt ſuite,
I doubt he had been both poore and
fooliſh; now, he asked wiſdome, and
gained greatneſſe; Becauſe he choſe

O the bountie and fidelitie of our

The goodneſs of a priuate man is his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3800:19"/>
owne; of a Prince, the whole worlds.
Their wordes are Maximes, their
actions examples, their examples,
rules. When <hi>I</hi> compare them with
their royall Father (as <hi>I</hi> doo ofte and
chearfully) I cannot ſay whether he
bee more happie in himſelfe, or in
them. I ſee both in him, and them; <hi>I</hi>
ſee &amp; wonder, that God diſtributes
to naturall princes giftes proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

Moderator of the world knows what
vſe is of their parts: he knowes that
the head muſt haue all the ſenſes that
pertaine to the whole bodie: And
how neceſſarie it is, that inferiours
ſhould admire them no leſſe for the
excellencie of their graces, then for
the ſwaie of their authoritie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
it is, that hee giues heroicall
qualities to Princes: and, as he hath
beſtowed vpon them his own name;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3800:20"/>
ſo alſo he giues them ſpeciall ſtamps

for yong and high courages to

and that libertie, that endes not

               <p>Farre be it from mee, to do that
which my next clauſe ſhal condemn:
but, I thinke it ſafe to ſay, that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
euer thoſe yeares haue promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
ſeldom haue performed ſo much.
Only God keep two miſchiefes euer
from within the ſmoke of his Court;
<hi>Flatterie</hi> and <hi>Trecherie:</hi> The iniquity
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3800:20"/>

not his inclination.</p>
               <p>For, whether as Engliſh, or as

to faune vpon Princes: Tho, what
do I beſtow two names vppon one
vice, but attyred in two ſundry ſutes
of euill: For, <hi>Flatterie</hi> is no other
than gilded treaſon; nothing elſe
but poyſon in golde: This euill is
more tame; not leſſe daungerous.
It had beene better for many great
ones not to haue beene, then to haue
beene in their conceites more then
men. This, <hi>Flatterie</hi> hath done: and
what can it not? That other, <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie,</hi>
ſpills the blood; this, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of Princes. That takes them
from others: This bereaues
them of themſelues. That, in
ſpight of the actours, doth but
change their Crowne: this ſteales it
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3800:21"/>
from them for euer. VVho can but
wonder, that reades of ſom not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
Princes, ſo bewitched with the
inchantments of their Paraſites, that
they haue thought themſelues Gods
immortall, and haue ſuffred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
ſo ſtiled, ſo adored? Neither tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
nor ſtatues, nor ſacrifices haue
ſeemed too much glory to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their ſelfe-loue; Now none of
all their actions could be either euil,
or vnbeſeeming; Nothing could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
from them worthy of cenſure,
vnworthy of admiration: Their very
ſpots haue beene beautie, their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
iuſtice, their errors wittie, their
Paradoxes diuine, their exceſſes he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall.
O the damnable ſeruilitie of

of that which themſelues laugh to ſee
beleeued. O the dangerous credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of ſelfe-loue which intertaines

all aduantages if neuer ſo euill, neuer
ſo impoſsible. How happy a ſeruice

and ſhal teach him to take his

truth, and bend his browes vpon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsiue

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3800:23"/>
not me, nor I it; an vnquiet element,
made only for wonder and vſe, not
for pleaſure. Alighted once from
that wodden conueyance, and
vneuen way, I bethought my ſelfe
how fondly our life is committed to
an vnſteadie and reeling peece of
wood, fickle windes, reſtleſſe waters;
while wee may ſet foot, on ſtedfaſt
and conſtant earth. Lo, then euery
thing taught me, euery thing deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me; ſo ready are we to be affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with thoſe forraine pleaſures,
which at home we ſhould ouer-look.
I ſaw much, as one might in ſuch a
ſpan of earth, in ſo fewe months. The
time fauored me: for, now newly had
the key of peace opened thoſe parts
which war had before cloſed; cloſed (I
ſay) to all Engliſh, ſaue either fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues
or captiues. All ciuill occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
(as what faire Cities, what
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3800:23"/>
ſtrange faſhions, entertainement,
dangers, delights we found) are fit
for other ears, and winter euenings.
What I noted, as a diuine within the

and that to your ſelf, which haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

emptie themſelues into great riuers;
and they againe into the Sea. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
do I deſire to tell you what you
know not: it ſhall be ſufficient that I
relate ought, which others ſhall think
memorable.</p>
               <p>Along our way, how many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ſaw we demoliſhed! Nothing
left, but rude heapes, to tell the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger,
there had beene both deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and hoſtilitie. O the miſerable
foot-ſteps of war, beſides bloodſhed,
ruine and deſolation! <hi>Furie</hi> hath don
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3800:24"/>
that there, which <hi>Couetouſneſſe</hi> would
do with vs; would do, but ſhall not:
The truth within, ſhal ſaue the walles
without. And, to ſpeak truely (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
the vulgar exclaime) Idolatrie
pull'd downe thoſe walles; not rage.
If ther had beene no Hollander to
raze them, they ſhould haue fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hide ſo much impiety
vnder their guiltie roofe. Theſe are
ſpectacles not ſo much of crueltie, as
iuſtice; Crueltie of man, Iuſtice of
God. But (which I wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred at) Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
fall, and Ieſuites Colledges rife,
euery where: There is no City, where
thoſe are not either rearing, or built.
Whence commeth this? Is it, for that
deuotion is not ſo neceſſarie as Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?
Thoſe men (as we ſay of the Fox)
fare beſt, when they are moſt curſed.
None ſo much ſpighted of their

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3800:24"/>
ſo oppoſed by ours: and yet theſe
ill weedes growe. Whoſoeuer liues

Poore ſoules! they could not be fooles

               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> talked there (in more boldneſſe,
perhaps, then wiſdom) with <hi>Coſterus</hi> a

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
then ſatisfie. Our diſcourſe was
long &amp; rouing; &amp; on his part ful both
of words &amp; vehemency. He ſpake as
at home; <hi>I</hi> as a ſtranger: yet ſo, as he
ſaw me modeſtly peremptory. The
particulars would ſwell my Letter
too much: It is enough, that the
Truth loſt leſſe then <hi>I</hi> gayned.
At <hi>Gaunt</hi> (a Citie that commaunds
reuerence for age, and wonder
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3800:25"/>
for the greatneſſe) wee fell vpon a
<hi>Cappucine</hi> nouice, which wept bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
becauſe he was not allowed to be
miſerable. His head had now felt the
razor, his backe the rod: all that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conicall
diſcipline pleaſed him well;
which another, being condemned
to, would iuſtly account a torment.
What hindred then? Piety, to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
would not permit this which he
thought piety to God: He could not
be a willing begger, vnleſſe his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
muſt begge vnwillingly. He was
the onely heire of his father, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtay of his mother: the comfort of
her widow-hoode depended on this
her orphane; who now naked muſt
enter into the worlde of the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,</hi>
as hee came firſt into this; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his goods to the diuiſion of the
fraternity: The leaſt part whereof
ſhould haue beene hers, whoſe hee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3800:26"/>
wiſhed all: Hence thoſe teares, that
repulſe. <hi>I</hi> pitied his ill-beſtowed
zeale; and rather wiſhed, then durſt
teach him more wiſedome. Theſe
men for deuoute, the Jeſuites for
learned and pragmaticall, haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed
all opinion, from other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
O hypocriſie! No <hi>Capucine</hi>
may take or touch ſiluer: for, theſe
are (you knowe) the quinteſſence of
<hi>Franciſcan</hi> ſpirits. This metall is as
very an <hi>Anathema</hi> to theſe, as the
wedge of gold to <hi>Achan;</hi> at the offer
whereof he ſtarts back, as <hi>Moſes</hi> from
the ſerpent: Yet he caries a boy with
him, that takes and caties it; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
complaines of either metall or

and, by this open trick of hypocriſie,
ſuſpected more, more cloſe. How
could I chooſe? while commonly the

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3800:26"/>
of that which is loathſom in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,

The wilde deſerts (on which
it borders) are haunted with three
kindes of ill cattell; Free-booters,

Witches that haue put on the ſhape
of thoſe cruell beaſts. Wee ſawe a
boy there, whoſe halfe-face was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
by one of them neere the
village: yet ſo, as that the eare was
rather out then bitten off. Nor many
dayes before our comming, at <hi>Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>

               <p>One thing I may not omit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſinfull ouer-ſight; A ſhort, but

of butchers, of buyers; ſome knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
others bagaining, moſt talking,
all buſie. It was ſtrange to ſee one
houſe ſacred to God, and the belly;
and how thoſe two ſeruices agreed:
The Prieſt did eate fleſh, the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
ſold fleſh in one roofe, at one

it by peeces; the Prieſt did ſacrifice,

Theſe, while they fill the

the faith of ſome, and
make all men wonder. Our nature
is greedy of newes; which it will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

for their frequence. <hi>I</hi> had thought,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3800:32"/>
our age had had too many graye
hayres, and with time experience,
and with experience craft, to haue
deſcryed a iuggler: but, now <hi>I</hi> ſee,
by the ſimplicitie, it declines to his

a iuſt volume of this ſubiect, and
furniſht my ſelfe accordingly in that
region of wonders; but that I fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſurcharge the nice ſtomach of

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3800:32"/>

to an ouer long diſcourſe. May it
pleaſe you therefore to receiue, in
ſhort, what I haue deliberately reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in my ſelfe, and think I can make
good to others.</p>
               <p>I haue noted foure ranks of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
named Miracles: from which,
if you make a iuſt ſubduction, how
fewe of our wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders ſhal remaine ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to beleefe or admiration? The
firſt meerely reported, not ſeene to
be done; the next ſeeming to be don,
but counterfaited; the third, truely
done, but not true miracles; the laſt,
truely miraculous, but by Satan. The
firſt of theſe are bred of lyes, and
nouriſhed by credulitie: The
mouth of fame is full of ſuch blaſts.
For theſe, if I liſted awhile to rake
in the <hi>Legends,</hi> and booke of <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,</hi>
an ingenuous Papiſt could
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3800:33"/>
not but bluſh, an indifferent Reader
could not but lay his hand on his
ſpleene, and wonder as much that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
man could bee ſo impudent to
broach ſuch reports, or any ſo ſimple
to beleeue them; as the credulous
multitude wonders that any ſhould
be ſo powerfull to effect them. But, I
ſeeke neither their ſhame, nor others
laughter. <hi>I</hi> dare ſay, not the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi>
not the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> hath more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible
tales, more ridiculous lyes.
Yea, to this head, <hi>Canus</hi> himſelfe (a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Papiſt) dare referre many of
thoſe antient miracles reported, and
(by all likelihood) beleeued of <hi>Bede,</hi>
and <hi>Gregory.</hi> The next are bred of
fraud, &amp; cozenage, nouriſhed by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.

ſerues all this clamour, from the two

the matter, makes a miracle. If <hi>Peters</hi>

How many ſicke men haue mended,

Tho many other alſo (I doubt not) of

that miracles are wroght by Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; the

of this author. <hi>I</hi> contend not of

is no ſorcery, or this is it. All ſhall bee
plaine, if the doctrine confirmed by
their miracles be once diſcuſſed: for,
if that be diuine truth, we do vniuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impugne theſe workes as diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;

Theſe workes tend all chiefly to this

That God &amp; Saints are to be adored

not of GOD. There cannot be
any diſcourſe, wherein it is more
eaſie to bee tedious. To ende;
If prayers were but in wordes, and

wrong offered to thoſe heauenly
ſpirits, then by our importunate
ſuperſtitions to be thruſt into Gods
throne; and to haue forced vppon
them the honours of their Maker.
There is no contradiction in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
a Saint cannot allowe that an
Angell forbids. <hi>See thou doe it not,</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:3800:39"/>

and ſome of them (too eaſie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance)

or perhaps, in ſtead of him, haue after
a looſe and filthy life brought home
ſome idle Puppet in a boxe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſpende their deuotion. Let
their wracke warne you: and let their
follies bee entertained by you, with

your Honour too well to feare you:
your young yeares haue been ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
preuented with ſoueraigne
antidotes of truth and holy inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
that this infection deſpaires of

preuailing. Your very bloud giues
you argument of ſafety: yet, good
counſell is not vnſeaſonable, euen
where danger is not ſuſpected. For
Gods ſake, my Lord, whatſoeuer you
gaine, loſe nothing of the truth; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
nothing of your loue and pietie
to God; of your fauour and zeale to
religion. As ſure as there is a God,
you were trained vp in the true
knowledge of him. If either Angell,
or Diuell, or Ieſuite, ſhould ſuggeſt
the contrary, ſend him away, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance.
There you ſee and heare, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

ſtriuing and pleading for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

hath paſt ſentence fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, on our
ſide. Doe not you ſtoope ſo much as
to a doubt, or motion of irreſolution.
Abandon thoſe from your table and
ſalt, whom your owne or others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3800:46"/>
ſhall deſcry dangerous;
Thoſe ſerpents are full of inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
But, of all, thoſe of your owne
Country: which are ſo much more
pernicious, by how much they haue
more colour of priuiledge of entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Religion is the greateſt care:
aduiſes for cariage, &amp; improuement
of trauaile, chalenge the next place.
I neede not counſell you to keepe
your ſtate, with affability; and ſo to
menage your ſelfe, as that your cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie
may be more viſible, then your
greatneſſe. Nature hath taught you
this, and hath ſecretly propagated it
from your Father: who, by his ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of diſpoſition, wonne as many
hearts, as by his valour and munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
I rather tell you, that a good
nature hath betrayd many; who, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
for that in others which they
haue found in themſelues, haue at laſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3800:46"/>
complained of their owne credulity,
and others deceit. Truſt not Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
too much; with your counſell,
with your perſon: and, in your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
familiarities, haue an eye to their
common diſpoſition, and infirmities.
Thoſe natures, wherewith you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe,
are ſubiect to diſpleaſure; and
violent, in purſuit of ſmal indignities.
Yeſterday heard I named, from no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull

ſoules from the field to their place:
yet he euer as the patient in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell;
and for this, mentioned with
more then excuſe: I cenſure not how
iuſtly. This is others care: Onely
hence I argue the rifeneſs of vnkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
taken, and purſued. You ſhall
ſee, that the ſoile is not ſo diuerſe, as
the inclination of perſons: vvho,
in all Climates, though they differ in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3800:47"/>
particulars, yet ſtill agree too well in
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon falls. The Italian deepe, cloſe,
and crafty; the French raſh; the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
dull. One not forward to offer
wrongs; but, apprehenſiue of a ſmall
wrong offred: another, prone either
to take, or giue them; but, not vneaſie
to remit: another, long in conceiuing,
long in retaining. What doe I exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie?
Ther are long Catalogues of
peculiar vices, that haunt ſpeciall
places; which, if they were not noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
infamous, my charity would
ſerue me to particularize: It were pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
ther ſhould be fewer vertues, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and proper. There are good vſes
to bee made of others enormities; if
no more, by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to correct our owne:
who loathes vice in another, is in good
forwardnes to leaue it in himſelf. The
view of the publique calamities, and
diſorders of other Churches, ſhall

beſt teach you thankfulneſſe for the
better ſtate of ours: But, better vſe of
their vertues; by how much it is more
excellent to knowe what wee ſhould
doe, then what we ſhould not. You
muſt now looke vpon all things, not
with the eyes of a ſtranger onely, but
of a Philoſopher, but of a Chriſtian;
which accounts all loſt, that is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to practice. It is a great praiſe,
that you are wiſer by the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of forraine things; but, much
greater, that you are better. That you
haue ſeene Cities, and Courts, and
<hi>Alpes,</hi> &amp; Riuers, can neuer yield you
ſo ſound comfort, as that you haue
lookt ſeriouſly into your ſelfe. In vain
doe we affect all forraine knowledge,
if we be not throughly acquainted at
home. Thinke much, and ſay little;
eſpecially in occaſions of diſpraiſe:
wherein, both a little is enough, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3800:48"/>
oft-times any thing is too much. You
cannot enquire too much: that, which
in vs inferiours would bee cenſured
for da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous curioſity, in your great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
ſhall be conſtrued as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deſire of knowledge. Ask ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
men of greateſt parts &amp; reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
&amp; where you finde Fame no lier,
note &amp; reſpect them. Make choice of
thoſe for conuerſation, which either
in preſent, or in hope, are eminent:
&amp; when you meet with excellencies
in any faculty, leaue not without ſom
gaine of knowledge. What are others
graces to you, if you onely admire
them; not imitate, not appropriate
them? Lo, your equals in time growe
vp happily in the Colledge (ſo I may
tearme it) of our young, and hopefull
Court, which you haue left; and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all, that gracious Preſident of
worthineſſe and perfection: whom
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3800:48"/>
while in all other things you ſerue,
you may without reproofe emulate
for learning, vertue, pietie. My ſelfe

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3800:53"/>
if ſhee were nor fooliſh. Our feare is
from doubt, and our doubt from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe:
and whence is our vnbeleefe,
but chiefly from ignorance? Shee
knowes not what good is elſe-where:
ſhee beleeues not her part in it. Get

willing to part with earthly. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

not the other. If you would deſpiſe
earth therefore, thinke of heauen. If
you would haue death eaſie, thinke
of that glorious life that followes it.
Certainely if we can indure paine, for
health; much more ſhall we abide a
fewe pangs, for glorie. Thinke how
fondly wee feare a vanquiſht enemy.
Lo, Chriſt hath triumpht ouer Death:
hee bleedeth and gaſpeth vnder vs;
and yet we tremble. It is enough to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3800:53"/>
vs, that Chriſt died: Neither would
he haue died, but that we might die
with ſafetie, and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Thinke, that death is neceſſarily
annexed to nature: Wee are for a
time on condition that wee ſhall not
be; wee receiue life, but vppon the
tearmes of redeliucrie. Neceſsitie
makes ſomethings eaſie; as it vſually
makes eaſie things difficult. It is a
fond iniuſtice to embrace the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and ſhrinke at the condition.</p>
               <p>Thinke, there is but one common
rode to all fleſh: There are no by-paths
of any fairer, or neerer way;
no, not for Princes. Euen companie

What worlds of men are gone

Haue wee beene at ſo many

your ſelfe death is not now ſo
fearefull, as your life would then bee
weariſome.</p>
               <p>Thinke not ſo much what Death

for what. Wee receiue euen home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
meſſengers from great perſons;
not without reſpect to their maiſters:
And what matters it who hee bee, ſo

What vſe, what ſight is ther of the

What an heauen do I feele in my ſelf,
when (after many trauerſes of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation)
I finde, in my heart, a feeling
poſſeſſion of my God! When I can
walke, and conuerſe with the God of
heauen, not without an openneſſe of

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3800:57"/>
hath caught faſt and ſenſible hold of

down to it ſelfe, or rather lifts vp it
ſelfe to him; and can and dare ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
auouch, I knowe whom I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued:
When I can looke vpon all
this inferiour creation, with the eyes
of a ſtranger, &amp; am tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſported to my

ſelfe in the view and meditation of
my future glory, and that preſent

while my weakeneſſes are pardoned,
and my actes meaſured by my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
and my deſires by their ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie;
Laſtly, when I can finde my ſelfe
(vpon holy reſolution) made firme

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3800:58"/>
the good with moderate regard, the
euill with courage and patience, both
with thanks; ſtrongly ſettled to good
purpoſes, conſtant and cheerefull in

I can be thus, and pity the poore and
miſerable proſperity of the godleſſe;
and laugh at their moneths of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and ſorrow at my owne: But
then againe (for why ſhould I ſhame
to confeſſe it?) the world thruſts it

that light which ſhined to my

Then I begin to compare my

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3800:58"/>
men thus blockiſh and earthen? or,
am I alone worſe then the reſt,
and ſingular in my wretchedneſſe?
Nowe I carie my carcaſſe vp and
downe careleſly, and (as dead
bodies are rubbed, without heate)
I doe in vaine force vpon my ſelfe

I endeuour my wonted worke, but
without an heart; there is nothing
is not tedious to mee, no not my
ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thus I am, till I ſingle my ſelfe
out alone, to him that alone canne
reuiue mee: I reaſon with my ſelfe,
&amp; confer with him; I chide my ſelfe,
and intreat him: and, after ſome
ſpirituall ſpeeches interchanged, <hi>I</hi>
renue my familiaritie vvith him; and
he the tokens of his loue to me. Lo,
then I liue againe, and applaud my

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3800:59"/>
might euer continue, and think baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Thus I hold on, riſing and falling; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

can be cooler to you.
True loue is like a ſtrong ſtreame,
which the further it is from the head,
runnes with more violence. The
thoughts of thoſe pleaſures <hi>I</hi> was
wont to finde in your preſence, were
neuer ſo delightful, as now when I am
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3800:60"/>
barred from renuing them. I wiſh
me with you; yea (if I could or might
wiſh to change) I ſhould wiſh mee
your ſelfe. To liue hidden, was neuer
but ſafe, and pleaſant; but now, ſo
much better, as the world is worſe.
It is an happineſſe, not to bee a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the miſchiefe of the times;
which it is hard to ſee, and bee guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.
Your Philoſophical Cell is a ſafe
ſhelter from tumults, from vices, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
diſcontentments. Beſides that liuely,
honeſt, and manly pleaſure, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes
from the gaine of Knowledge in
the deepe myſteries of Nature; How
eaſie is it, in that place to liue free
from the common cares, from the
infection of common euils. Whether
the Spaniard gaine or ſaue by his
peace, and how hee keepes it; and
whether it were ſafer for the States
to lay downe armes, and bee at once
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3800:60"/>
ſtill and free; Whether the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
truce, with the Turke, were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
and ſeaſonable; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Venice</hi> haue wonne or loſt by her
late iarres; are thoughts that dare
not looke-in at thoſe doores. Who is
enuied, and who pittied at Court;
Who buyes hopes, and kindeneſſe
deareſt; who layes ſecret mines to
blowe vp another, that himſelfe may
ſucceede, can neuer trouble you:
Theſe cares dare not enter into that
Sanctuarie of Peace. Thence you
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee how all, that liue publique, are
toſſed in theſe waues, and pitty them.
For, great places haue ſeldome ſafe
and eaſie entrances: and (which is
worſt) great charges can hardly bee
plauſibly wielded, without ſom indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
policies. Alas! their priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
cannot counteruaile their toile.
Wearie dayes, and reſtleſſe nights,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3800:61"/>
ſhort liues and long cares, weake bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
&amp; vnquiet mindes attend light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on greatneſs. Either Clients break
their ſleepe in the morning, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of their minde driues it off
from the firſt watch: Either ſutes or
complaints thruſt themſelues into
their recreations; and Packets of
Letters interrupt their meales. It is
euer Terme with them, without Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
Their buſineſſes admit of no
night, no holiday: Lo, your priuacie
frees you from all this, and what-euer
other glorious miſerie. There you
may ſleepe, and eate, and honeſtly
diſport, and enioy your ſelfe, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
both your ſelfe and others.
And, whiles you are happy, you liue
out of the reach of Enuie; vnleſſe my
praiſes ſend that gueſt thither: which
I ſhould iuſtly condemne as the fault
of my loue. No man offers to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3800:61"/>
you, none to diſgrace you: you
could not want theſe inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences
abroad. Yea, let a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liue in the open
world, but as a looker on, hee ſhall be
ſure not to want abundance of vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
An ill minde holds it an eaſie
torment, to liue in continuall ſight of
euill; if not rather a pleaſure: but, to
the well diſpoſed, it is next to hell.
Certainly, to liue among Toades &amp;
Serpents, is a Paradiſe to this. One
ieſts pleaſantly with his Maker: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
makes himſelf ſport with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
One fills his mouth with oathes
of ſound: another ſcoffes at the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.
One ſpeakes villany; another
laughes at it; a third defends it. One
makes himſelf a Swine; another a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell:
Who (that is not all earth) can
endure this? who cannot wiſh himſelf
rather a deſolate Hermite, or a cloſe
priſoner? Euery euill we ſee, doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3800:62"/>
vexe, or infect vs. Your retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
auoids this; yet ſo, as it equally
eſcapes all the euills of Solitarineſſe.
You are full of friends; whoſe ſociety,
intermixed with your cloſenes, makes
you to want little of publique. The
Deſert is too wilde, the City too popu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lous:
the Country is only fit for reſt.
I knowe, there want not ſom obſcure
corners, ſo haunted with dulneſs, that
as they yield no outward vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
ſo no inward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment. Yours
is none of thoſe; but ſuch as ſtriues ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with the pleaſure of it, to require
the ſolitarineſſe. The Court is for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
the City for gain, the Country
for quietneſſe; A bleſsing, that neede
not (in the iudgement of the wiſeſt)
yield to the other two. Yea, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
haue we knowen, that hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a cote of thatch to hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3800:62"/>
pomp of the mighty? How much
more may thoſe which haue full
hands, and quiet hearts, pitty them
both? I do not ſo much praiſe you in
this, as wonder at you. I know many
vpon whom the conſcience of their
wants, forces a neceſſary obſcurity;
who if they can ſteale a vertue out of
neceſsity, it is well: but, I no where
knowe ſo excellent parts ſhrouded
in ſuch willing ſecrecie. The worlde
knowes you, and wants you; and yet
you are volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarily hid. Loue your ſelf

our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon mother call you forth
to her neceſſary ſeruice, &amp; charge you
to neglect your ſelfe, to pleaſure her.
Which once don; you know where to

you, I am ſure you ſhall your ſelf: and

for, either a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt haue
ſtrong hands of reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to ſtrangle it in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome;
or elſe it driues him to ſome
ſecret miſchiefe: whereas ſorrow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed,
is halfe remedied, and euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
in the vttering. Your griefe was
wiſely diſcloſed; and ſhall bee as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3800:73"/>
ſtrangely anſwered. I am glad of your
ſorrow; and ſhould weepe for you, if
you did not thus mourne. Your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
is, that you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not enough grieue
for your ſinnes. Let me tell you, that
the Angells themſelues ſing at this
lamentation; neither doth the earth
afford any ſo ſweete muſicke in the
eares of God. This heauineſſe is the
way to ioy. Worldly ſorow is worthy
of pitie, becauſe it leadeth to death:
But, this deſerues nothing but enuie
and gratulation. If thoſe teares were
common, hell would not ſo enlarge
it ſelfe. Neuer ſinne, repented of, was
puniſhed: and neuer any thus mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and repented not. Lo, you haue
done that, which you grieue you
haue not done. That good GOD,
whoſe act is his will, accounts of our
wil as our deed. If he required ſorrow
proportionable to the hainouſneſſe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3800:73"/>
of our ſinnes, there were no end of
mourning. Now, his mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
not ſo much the meaſure, as
the truth of it; &amp; accounts vs to haue
that which we complaine to want. I
neuer knew any truly penitent, which
in the depth of his remorſe, was afraid
of ſorowing too much; nor any vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant,
which wiſht to ſorrow more.
Yea, let me tell you, that this ſorrow
is better, and more, then that deep
heauineſſe for ſin, which you deſire.
Many haue beene vexed with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
remorſe for ſom ſin, from the
gripes of a galled co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, which yet
never cam wher true repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance grew;
in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce plaies at once the
accuſer, witnes, Iudge, torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tor: But,
an earneſt grief, for the want of grief,
was neuer found in any but a gratious
heart. You are happy, &amp; complaine.
Tell me, I beſeech you; This ſorrow
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3800:74"/>
which you mourne to want, is it a
grace of the ſpirit of God, or not? If
not, why do you ſorrow to want it? If
it be, oh how happy it is to grieue for
wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of grace! The God of all truth &amp;
bleſſednes hath ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe
that hunger and thirst after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi>
and, with the ſame breath, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are they that mourne: for, they ſhall
be comforted.</hi> You ſay, you mourne;
Chriſt ſaith, you are bleſſed: you ſay
you mourne; Chriſt ſaith, you ſhall
bee comforted. Either now diſtruſt
your Sauiour, or elſe confeſſe your
happineſſe, and with patience expect
his promiſed conſolation. What do
you feare? you ſee others ſtand like
ſtrong Oakes, vnſhaken, vnremoued:
you are but a reed, a feeble plant, toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
&amp; bowed with euery winde, and
with much agitation bruſed: Lo, you
are in tender and fauourable hands,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3800:74"/>
that neuer brake any, whom their ſins
bruiſed; neuer bruiſed any whom
temptations haue bowed. You are
but flax; and your beſt is not a flame,
but an obſcure ſmoke of grace: Lo,
here his ſpirit is as a ſoft winde, not
as cold water; he will kindle, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
quench you. The ſorrow you
want, is his gift: Take heede leaſt
while you vex your ſelfe with diſlike
of the meaſure, you grudge at the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.
Beggers may not chooſe. This
portion hee hath vouchſafed to giue
you, if you haue any, it is more then
he was bound to beſtow: yet you ſay,
What, no more? As if you tooke it
vnkindely, that he is no more liberal.
Euen theſe holy diſcontentments are
dangerous. Deſire more (ſo much as
you can) but repine not, when you
do not attain. Deſire; but ſo as you be
free from impatience, free from vnthankfulnes.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3800:75"/>
Thoſe, that haue tried,
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay how difficult it is to complain,
with due reſeruation of thanks. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know I whether is worſe, to long
for good things impatiently, or not
at all to deſire them. The fault of
your ſorrow, is rather in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
then in it ſelf. And, if indeed you
mourne not enough, ſtay but Gods
leiſure, and your eyes ſhall run ouer
with teares. How many doe you ſee
ſport with their ſinnes, yea bragge of
them? How many that ſhould die for
want of paſtime, if they might not ſin
freely, and more freely talke of it?
What a Saint are you to theſe, that
can droup vnder the memory of the
frailty of youth, and neuer think you
haue ſpent enow teares! Yet ſo I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
you in what you haue, as
one that perſwades you not to deſiſt
from ſuing for more. It is good to be
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3800:75"/>
couetous of grace, and to haue our
deſires heerein enlarged with our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits.
Weepe ſtill, and ſtill deſire to
weepe: but, let your teares be as the
raine in a ſun-ſhine; comfortable and
hopefull: and let not your longing,
ſauour of murmur, or diſtruſt. Theſe
teares are reſerued; this hunger ſhall
be ſatisfied; this ſorrow ſhall be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted:
There is nothing betwixt
God and you, but time. Preſcribe
not to his wiſedome: haſten not his
mercy. His grace is enough for you:
his glory ſhall bee more then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>

VVee veſſels, that haue any emptie

not. If we pardon your cloſeneſs, you
may well beare with our profuſion: If
there be any wrong, it is to our ſelues,
that we vtter what we ſhould lay vp.
It is a pardonable fault to do leſs good
to our ſelues, that we may doe more
to others. Amongſt other indeuors,
I haue boldly vndertaken the holy
meeters of <hi>Dauid;</hi> how happily, iudge
you by what you ſee. Ther is none of
all my labors ſo open to all cenſures;
none, wherof I wold ſo willingly hear
the verdit of the wiſe, and iudicious.
Perhaps, ſome think the verſe harſh;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3800:77"/>
whoſe nice eare regards roundneſſe,
more then ſenſe: I embrace ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but affect it not. This is the
leaſt good quality of a verſe; that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
any thing but muſicall delight.
Others may blame the difficulty of
the tunes: whoſe humour cannot be
pleaſed without a greater offence.
For, to ſay truth, I neuer could ſee
good verſe written in the wonted
meaſures. I euer thought them moſt
eaſie, and leaſt Poeticall. This fault (if
any) will light vpon the negligence
of our people; which endure not to
take paines for any fit variety: The
French &amp; Dutch haue giuen vs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
examples of diligence, &amp; exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiteneſſe
in this kinde. Neither our
eares, nor voices are leſſe tunable.
Heere is nothing wanting, but will to
learne. What is this but to eate the
corne out of the eare, becauſe we wil
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3800:78"/>
not abide the labour to grinde, and
knead it? If the queſtion be, whether
our verſe muſt deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or they
aſcend to it; a wiſe moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I think
would determine it moſt equall, that
each part ſhould remit ſomwhat, and
both meet in the midſt. Thus I haue
endeuored to do, with ſincere intent
of their good, rather then my own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.
For, it had been eaſie to haue

recalles euer to my thoughts
<hi>Eſops</hi> Storke, taken amongſt the

baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. He ſerued an ill maſter;
but, with an honeſt heart, with cleane
hands. The maſters iniuſtice doth no
more infect a good ſeruant, then the
truth of the ſeruant can iuſtifie his ill
maſter. A bad workeman may vſe a
good inſtrument: and oft-times a
cleane napkin wipeth a foule mouth.
It ioyes me yet to think, that his pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3800:82"/>
as it euer held friendſhip in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
ſo now it wins him friends in this

by vs. That GOD, whom hee
ſerues, will be knowen to thoſe rude
and ſcarce humane Chriſtians, for a
protector of innocence, a fauourer
of truth, a rewarder of Pietie. The
mercy of our gratious King, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion
of an honorable Councellor,
the loue of a true friend, and (which
wrought all, and ſet all on worke) the
grace of our good God, ſhal now looſe
thoſe bonds, and giue a glad welcome
to his libertie, and a willing farewel to
his diſtreſſe. Hee ſhall, <hi>I</hi> hope, liue
to acknowledge this; in the meane
time, <hi>I</hi> do for him. Thoſe Ruſsian af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
are not more worthie of your
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3800:82"/>
records, then your loue to this friend
is worthie of mine. For, neither cold
this large Sea drowne or quench it,
nor time and abſence (which are wont
to breed a lingring conſumption of
friendſhip) abate the heat of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which his kindneſſe bred, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
nouriſhed. Both rareneſſe, and
worth ſhall commend this true loue;
which (to ſay true) hath beene now
long out of faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neuer times yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
more loue; but, not more ſubtle.
For, euery man loues himſelfe in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
loues the eſtate in the perſon:
Hope of aduantage is the loadſtone
that drawes the yro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> harts of men; not

that this outwarde durance of the

Lo, that enioyes God, enioyes it ſelf,

<hi>Melancholy,</hi> hee thinkes his day
ſpent happily. And thus it muſt needs
bee; while the world is his God, his
deuotion can bee but his pleaſure:
whereas the mortified ſoule, hath
learned to ſcorne theſe friuolous and
ſinfull ioyes; and affects either ſolid
delights, or none; and had rather be
dull for want of mirth, then tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with wanton pleaſures. When the
world, like an importunate Minſtrel,
thruſts it ſelfe into his chamber, and
offers him Muſicke, vnſought; if hee
vouch-ſafe it the hearing, it is the
higheſt fauour he dare, or can yield:
Hee rewards it not, hee commends
it not; Yea, hee ſecretlie loathes
thoſe harſh and iarring notes, and
reiects them. For, hee findes a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conſort within, betwixt GOD
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3800:89"/>
and himſelfe, when hee hath a little
tuned his heart with meditation.
To ſpeake fully, the World is like an
ill foole in a play: the Chriſtian is a
iudicious ſpectator, which thinkes
thoſe ieſtes too groſſe to bee laught
at; and therefore entertaines that
with ſcorne, which others with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.
Yet in truth, wee ſinne, if
wee reioyce not: There is not
more errour in falſe mirth, then in
vniuſt heauineſſe. If Worldlings
offende, that they laugh when they
ſhould mourne; wee ſhall offende
no leſſe, if wee droupe in cauſe of
cheerefulneſſe. Shall wee enuie, or
ſcorne, to ſee one ioy in redde and
white droſſe, another in a vaine ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;

a friend; one in a Kite, another in
a Dogge; vvhiles vvee enioy the

God of heauen, and are ſorrowfull?
What dull metall is this we are made
of? We haue the fountaine of ioy, and
yet complaine of heauineſſe. Is there
any ioy, without God? Certainly, if
ioy be good, and all goodneſſe be fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
him; whence ſhould ioy ariſe, but
from him? And if hee be the Author
of ioy; how are we Chriſtians, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
not? What? doe wee freeze in
the fire, and ſtarue at a feaſt? Haue we
a good conſcience, and yet pine and
hang down the head? When GOD
hath made vs happy, do we make our
ſelues miſerable? When I aske my
heart <hi>Dauids</hi> queſtion, I knowe not
whether I bee more angry, or aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
at the anſwer; <hi>Why art thou ſad,
my ſoule?</hi> My body, my purſe, my
fame, my friends; or perhaps none
of theſe: only I am ſad, becauſe I am.
And what if all theſe, what if more?
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3800:90"/>
when I come to my better wits, Haue
I a father, an aduocate, a comforter, a
manſion in heauen? if both earth and
hell conſpired to afflict me, my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
cannot counteruaile the cauſes
of my ioy. Now I can chalenge all
aduerſaries; and either defie all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
or bid all croſſes, yea death it

abbridge vs of theſe earthly ſolaces,
which dare weigh with our diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments,
&amp; ſometimes depreſs the
balance. His greater light doth not
extinguiſh the leſſe. If God had not

bleſsings, if they delight vs not?

are, and muſt bee expected. Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
abates griefe, and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
a croſſe. Or, if your a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> not
fore-thinke your loſſe; take it equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
but as it falls. A wiſe man and a
Chriſtian, knowes death ſo fatall to
Nature, ſo ordinary in euent, ſo gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in the iſſue, that I wonder hee can
for this either feare or grieue. Doth
GOD onely lend vs one another,
and doe wee grudge when hee calls
for his owne? So <hi>I</hi> haue ſeene ill
debters, that borrow with prayers,
keepe with thankes, repay with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.
Wee miſtake our tenure:
Wee take that for gift, which GOD
intendes for loane; Wee are Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
at will, and thinke our ſelues
owners. Your wife and childe are
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3800:93"/>
dead: Well; they haue done that for
which they came.</p>
               <p>If they could not haue died, it
had beene worthy of wonder; not at
all, that they are dead. If this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
were proper onely to our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;
and friends, or yet to our cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
alone; how vnhappy ſhould we
ſeeme to our neighbours, to our
ſelues! Now it is common, let vs
mourne that wee are men. Lo, all
Princes and Monarchs daunce with
vs in the ſame ring: yea, what ſpeake I
of earth? The God of Nature, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath trod the ſame ſteps
of death? And doe wee thinke much
to follow him? How many ſeruants
haue wee knowen, that haue thruſt
themſelues betwixt their Maiſter &amp;
death; which haue died, that their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
might not dy? and ſhall we repi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
to die with ours? How truly may we
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3800:94"/>
ſay of this our <hi>Dauid, Thou art worth
ten thouſand of vs;</hi> yea, worth a world
of Angels: yet he died, and died for
vs. Who would liue, that knowes his
Sauiour died? who can be a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
and would not be like him? Who
can bee like him, that would not die
after him? Thinke of this, and iudge
whether all the world can hire vs not
to die. I need not aske you, whether
you loued thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue loſt:
Could you loue them, and not wiſh
they might bee happy? Could they
be happy, and not die? In truth, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
knowes not what ſhee would
haue; Wee can neither abide our
friends miſerable in their ſtay, nor
happy in their departure: Wee loue
our ſelues ſo well, that we cannot be
content they ſhould gaine by our
loſſe. The excuſe of your ſorrow is,
that you mourn for your ſelfe. True:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3800:94"/>
but, compare theſe two, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your loſſe or their gain be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
For, if their aduantage exceede
your loſſe; take heed, leaſt while you
bewray your loue in mourning for
them, it appeare that you loue but
your ſelfe in them. They are gone to
their preferment, and you lament:
your loue is iniurious. If they were
vaniſhed to nothing, <hi>I</hi> could not
blame you, tho you tooke vp <hi>Rachels</hi>
lamentation: But now, you knowe
they are in ſurer handes then your
owne: you knowe, that he hath taken
them, which hath vndertaken to keep
them, to bring them againe: You
knowe, it is but a ſleepe, which is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
<hi>Death;</hi> and that they ſhall,
they muſt awake, as ſure as they lie
down; and wake more freſh, more
glorious, then when you ſhut their
eyes. What do we with <hi>Chriſtianitie,</hi> if
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3800:95"/>
we beleeue not this? and if wee doe
beleeue it, why doe wee mourne as
the hopeleſs? But the matter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
is not ſo heauie as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance:
Your croſſes came ſudden,
and thicke; You could not breathe
from your firſt loſſe, ere you felt a
worſe. As if hee knew not this, that
ſent both: As if he did it not on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
His proceedings ſeeme harſh;
are moſt wiſe, moſt iuſt. It is our
fault, that they ſeeme otherwiſe then
they are. Doe we thinke, wee could
carue better for our ſelues? O the
mad inſolence of Nature, that dares
controll, where ſhe ſhould wonder!
Preſumptuous clay! that wil be check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Potter. Is his wiſedome,
himſelfe? Is he, in himſelfe, infinite?
is his Decree out of his wiſedom; and
doe wee murmur? Doe wee, fooliſh
wormes, turne againe when he treads
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3800:95"/>
vpon vs? What? doe you repine at
that which was good for you, yea
beſt? That is beſt for vs, which God
ſeeth beſt: and that he ſees beſt, which
he doth. This is Gods doing. Kiſſe
his rod in ſilence, and giue glory to
the hand that rules it. His will is the
rule of his actions; and his goodneſs,
of his will. Thinges are good to vs,
becauſe he wills them: He wills them,
becauſe they are good to himſelfe. It
is your glory that he intends, in your
ſo great affliction. It is no praiſe to
wade ouer a ſhallow Ford: but, to cut
the ſwelling waues of the Deepe,
commendes both our ſtrength and
skill. It is no victorie, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
an eaſie and weake croſſe.
Theſe maine euils haue crownes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to their difficulty: Wreſtle
now, and goe away with a bleſsing.
Bee patient in this loſſe, and you
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3800:96"/>
ſhall once triumph in your gaine. Let
God haue them with cheerefulneſſe,
and you ſhall enioy God with them
in glory.</p>

this weake diſtruſt? Go
on, and I ſhall doubt whether I write
to a Chriſtian. You haue loſt your
heart, together with your wealth:
How can I but feare, leaſt this <hi>Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
was your God? Hence was
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3800:97"/>
Gods iealouſie in remoouing it; and
hence your immoderate teares for
loſing it. If thus; God had not loued
you, if he had not made you poore.
To ſome, it is an aduantage to leeſe:
you could not haue beene at once
thus rich, and good. Now, heauen is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to you, which was ſhut before; &amp;
could neuer haue giuen you entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
with that lode of iniquitie. If you be
wiſe in menaging your affliction, you
haue changed the world for GOD,
a little droſſe for heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Let me euer
loſe thus, and ſmart when I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain.</p>
               <p>But, you might haue at once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
both. The ſtomach, that is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
muſt bee content to part with
ſome good nouriſhment, that it may
deliuer it ſelfe of more euill humors.
God ſaw (that knowes it) you could
not hold him ſo ſtrongly, while one
of your hands was ſo faſtened vpon
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3800:97"/>
the world. You ſee, many make them
ſelues wilfully poore: why cannot you
be content God ſhould impoueriſh
you? If God had willed their pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he would haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded it: If he
had not willed yours, he would not
haue effected it. It is a ſhame for a
Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſee an Heathen philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
laugh at his owne ſhipwracke;
while himſelfe houles out, as if all his
felicity were imbarked with his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
How ſhould we ſcorn, to think
that an heathen man ſhould laugh ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at our ignorance, or impotence?
ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, if we thought too highly of
earthly things; impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, if we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
them. The feare of ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
is worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſenſe. To ſpeake
ingenuouſly; I could neuer ſee, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
pouerty deſerued ſo hard a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceit.
It takes away the delicacy of fare, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſe
of lodging, gayneſſe of attyre,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:3800:98"/>
and perhaps brings with it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt:
This is the worſt, and all. View it now
on the better ſide: Lo, there quiet
ſecuritie, ſound ſleepes, ſharpe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
free meriment; no feares, no
cares, no ſuſpicion, no diſtemper of
exceſſe, no diſcontentment. If I were
Iudge, my tongue ſhould be vniuſt, if
pouertie went away weeping. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee, how the euills it brings, can
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare with thoſe which it remoues;
how the diſcommodities ſhould
match the bleſsings of a mean eſtate.
What are thoſe you haue loſt, but
falſe friends, miſerable comforters?
Elſe they had not left you. Oh ſlight
and fickle ſtay, that windes could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue
you of! If your care could go
with them, here were no dammage:
and, if it go not with them, it is your
fault. Grieue more for your fault,
then for your loſſe. If your negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3800:98"/>
your riotous miſſpence had
empaired your eſtate, then Satan had
impoueriſht you; now would I haue
added to your griefe, for your ſinne,
not for your aſfliction: But now,
ſince windes and waters haue done
it as the officers of their maker; why
ſhould not you ſay with mee, as <hi>I</hi>
with <hi>Job, The Lord hath taken?</hi> Vſe
your loſſe well, and you ſhall finde
that God hath croſſed you with a
bleſsing. And if it were worſe then
the worlde eſteemes it, yet thinke
not what you feele, but what you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue:
You are a ſtranger to your
ſelfe, if you confeſſe not, that God
fauours you in this whip. If hee had
ſtripped you of better things, and
ſcourged you with worſe, you ſhould
ſtill haue acknowledged a mercifull
iuſtice: If you now repine at an eaſie
correction, you are worthy of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3800:99"/>
Beware the next, if you grudge
and ſwell at this. It is next to nothing
which you ſuffer: what can be further
from vs, then theſe goods of outward
eſtate? You need nor abate either
health, or mirth, for their ſakes. If
you do now draw the affliction nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
then hee which ſent it, and make
a forraine euil domeſticall; if while
God viſits your eſtate, you fetch it
home to your body, to your minde;
thank your ſelfe that you will needes
be miſerable: But, if you loue not to
fare ill; take croſſes as they are ſent,
and go lightly away with an
eaſie burden.</p>
