            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For partly by the States selling my lands out of which my maintenance there arose, and partly by reason of the alienating of mens spirits from me through the distance between me and the Antagonist I here answer, I was in a great measure frustrated of my hopes.

            <p>THe fame of the dispute between Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and my self at your Chappel, <hi>Jan. 1. 1649.</hi> was at first spread over the land by Mr. <hi>Bs</hi> abusive passage in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle before his book of <hi>The Saints everlasting rest:</hi> to which I opposed an answer in my Farewell-speech to you, and that it might be communicated to the Nation printed it with some additions in my Antidote, which I intended in the first place for your use. After this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> printed a large book for Infants-baptism, framed in manner of a Sermon as inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and accordingly tendred in an Epistle to you. In which how injuriously he hath dealt with me, and how weakly he hath opposed the truth I taught you, will appear in part by reading this Forerunner to the rest of the answer that is to come after. I did presently upon my first reading of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> book in a set speech briefly shew you Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> grounds, and the reason why they were unsatisfying. Yet neither my Antidote nor that speech do I find much regarded by many of you: nor perhaps will this writing take much with you. However I have conceived it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to tender this writing to you, that it might thereby appear, how vain the excessive boastings of Mr. <hi>Bs</hi> book have been; how justifiable their receiving the truth, who have yielded to it is; and how inexcusable they are that persist in Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> way. What ever you think or speak of me, yet I do, and shall study your good, and committing my labours for you and among you, to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Lord, I rest,</p>

            <p>
               <hi>ANd in the primitive times none were baptized without an expresse Covenanting, wherein they renounced the World, Flesh and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and engaged themselves to Christ, and promised to obey him; as you may see in</hi> Tertul. Origer, Cyprian, <hi>and others at large. I will cite but one for all, who was before the rest, and that is</hi> Justin Martyr; <hi>speaking of the way of baptizing the aged, saith,</hi> How we are dedicated to God, we will now open to you. As many as being penswaded do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve these things to be true which we teach, and do promise to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, they first learn by prayer and fasting to beg pardon of God for their former sins; our selves joining also our prayer and fasting. Then they are brought to the water, and are born again <hi>(or baptized)</hi> in the same way as we our selves were born again. For they are washed with water in the name of the Father, the Lord and God of all; and of our Saviour Jesus Christ; and of the Holy Ghost—Then we bring the person thus washed and instructed, to the Brethren, as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, where the Assemblies are; that we may pray both for our selves and the new illuminated person, that we may be found by true doctrine and by good works, worthy observers and keepers of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that we may attain eternal salvation. Then there is brought to the chief Brother, <hi>(so they called the chief Minister)</hi> Bread, and a Cup of Wine <hi>(washed;)</hi> which taking, he offereth praise and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to the Father by the name of the Son and Holy Ghost. And so a while he celebrateth thanksgiving. After prayers and thanksgiving, the whole Assembly saith <hi>Amen.</hi> Thanksgiving being ended by the President <hi>(or chief guide)</hi> &amp; the consent of the whole people, the Deacons as we call them, do give to every one present, part of the Bread and Wine, over which thanks was given; and they also suffer them to bring it to the absent. This food we call the Eucharist, to which no man is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but onely he that believeth the truth of our doctrine, being washed in the Laver of Regeneration for Remission of sin; and so liveth as Christ hath taught: <hi>Apol. 2. This then is no new overstrict way you see.</hi>

Which thing as it is true of natural brethren, when they contend about civil affaires, so it is too often found true among Christian brethren, yea even in the ministery of the Gospel, when they contend about the things of Christ whether out of faction, or conscience. We need not go far for instances to prove it: this last age hath verified it too plainly in the contentions between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> &amp; <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> in <hi>Germany, Remonstrants</hi> &amp; <hi>Contraremonstrants</hi> in <hi>Belgia, Prelatist;</hi> &amp; <hi>non-Conformists, Independents</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> Among others the providence of the Lord hath made me <hi>a man of contention,</hi> as the prophet complaines of himself, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 15. 10, and that which is most

grievous to me with my brethren in the ministery and faith of Christ, with whom. I hoped for a brotherly conjunction in the work of Christ, the yoke of <hi>Prelates</hi> being removed, and about that ordinance of baptisme, which should be a bond of union between us, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 5. I with others asserting <hi>infant-baptisme to be a corruption of the ordinance of baptisme,</hi> others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouching it <hi>as of God,</hi> and the countrary <hi>a pernitious error.</hi> The season in which I appeared in this matter, the spirits of men in <hi>Old,</hi> and <hi>New England</hi> being very thirsty after reformation in worship according to the word, humane inventions every where cried down, this being taken for a maxime against Papists, and Prelates, <hi>that in Gods worship we must keep close to the institution,</hi> and an Assembly called to that end, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament with them engaged in solemne Covenant,. I taking the way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Protestant writers afore I vented any thing in publique to debare the matter with learned Ministers, and after to present my exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Paedobaptisme</hi> to a Committee of the <hi>Assembly,</hi> gave me hopes of a facile and speedy way for clearing the point. But whether it were that mens resolutions were pitched on the patternes of other Churches, or sway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with prejudice, or fear or something else, I quickly found my hopes deceived, my very dissenting from them though in this candid manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting enmity towards me, and notwithstanding my reasons presented to them, Paedobaptisme established in the <hi>Directory,</hi> and the not practising of it, and gainsaying of it made <hi>penal;</hi> which things necessitated me to print my <hi>two Treatises,</hi> and this drew down on me a storm of writers, by whom mens spirits were exasperated against me, whereby I was enforced to print my <hi>Apology,</hi> afore I could review the dispute as I intended. But my <hi>Apology</hi> not preventing my removal from that place where I had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opportunity to write, and print then sithence, yet as soone as I could settle my self and family in any sort I applied my self to review the dispute according to the order of the <hi>Examen</hi> of Mr. <hi>Marshals</hi> sermon, which I had gone through unto the third conclusion, and had some purpose of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of it by it self, because of the difficulty in printing and sale of large things: Yet afore I did it by reason of the neighbour-hood of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I imparted some sheetes about 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. to him, out of which he took notes as he pleased, and quickly returned them to me without ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mad versions on them, which I hoped he would have done of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, as the manner of Schollers of acquaintance is in such cases. After some of my Auditors beginning to enquire after the duty of being baptized, it was propounded by one to have recourse to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and by me, if they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44370:6"/>
did so, to get his arguments in writing for infant-baptism: but our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours not succeeding; I yielded to a dispute though much against my mind, presaging from the knowledge I had of Mr. <hi>Baxters</hi> quicknesse and my own slownesse in answering an argument not under my eye, the favour of the most to Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> tenet, and a verseness from mine, and other accidents; Mr. <hi>B.</hi> likely to gain the fame of a victory, and to put back the work of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of that corruption, yet hoping Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would after have imparted to me his arguments in writing, that I might as Dr. <hi>Raynolds</hi> permitted <hi>Hart,</hi> mend my answers afore printing. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> denying it, and vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the passage in his <hi>Saints everlasting rest,</hi> wherein he speaks of <hi>grosse absurdities I was driven to,</hi> I was forced to print my <hi>Antidote,</hi> since which he hath printed a large book in which he hath raised much dust to darken the truth, and to asperse my person: which I am necessitated to answer, and to stay or order the review of the dispute between my self, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and others as there shall be cause.</p>

The very first and only text which speaks a word of baptism is so plain against infant-baptisme, that <hi>Paedobaptists</hi> in their Commentaries and disputes think it enough if they can avoid the force, of it against them. Yea is not Mr. Bs. own confession contradictory to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44370:7"/>
title of his book? page 3. posit. 1. He tells us <hi>of some things plainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in Scripture, others have no such determination.</hi> And saith, <hi>Such is the case of infant-baptisme.</hi> And page 301. <hi>If the very baptisme of infants it self be so darke in the Scripture, that the controversie is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become so hard as we finde it, &amp;c.</hi> And if it be <hi>so dark in Scripture, and found so hard by him,</hi> me thinks that he might not be thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude people; he should have altered the title, and forborne to talke as he doth in his book of bringing plain Scripture-proof to them that call for them. If I might be allowed to passe my censure on him as he doth on me, I would not stick to say, that laying aside his Rhetorick, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, interrogations, admirations, expostulations, misapprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my actions and answers, invectives against Anabaptists, and two or three quirkes of wit, there's as little matter to his purpose that hath the likenesse of solidity in his book as I have met within a book so specially set forth, and so much cried up, and that he doth onely <hi>magno caenatu nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas agere, endeavour much to trifle much;</hi> and that he had done better with the <hi>Oxford Convocatior,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> (as he cites him page 301.) with many others to have rested on tradition unwritten, then to bring such impertinent texts as he hath done for infant-baptisme. But I must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I am an Antagonist. He saith <hi>he was constrained thereunto una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably by my importunity.</hi> Answer, Ti's true I was importunate to have his arguments in writing: but never that he should print them, much lesse print my answers taken onely from my mouth either relying on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pen or his own memory. Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi> dealt not so with <hi>Hart</hi> the Jesuit: nor will I think an ingenuous scholler conceive his dealing candid, who knowes the difference of answering in verbal conference, and writing where the argument is before the respondent. If I were so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate he might have conceived it was for my satisfaction, which he denies to have been manifested to him page 281. or if it were onely for my neighbours there had been some love in it if we had had them without printing them, specially with such asperity and foule descirptions of me as he makes. But now he hath printed let's look upon them.</p>

Sect. 8. and may be seen by considering how he maintained a like antiquity and necessity of giving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants the Lords Supper both in the passage cited by me in my <hi>Apology</hi> out of the first book <hi>de pecc. merit. &amp; remiss.</hi> cap. 24. pag. 82. and lib. 3. <hi>de pecc. mer. &amp; remiss.</hi> c. 4. next to that which Mr. B. cites which Mr. B. doth not rightly cut off page 162. of his book; whence I gather that Mr. B. is not to be too easily trusted in his citations of Authors. The words he cites out of <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> his Epistle <hi>ad Zenam</hi> prove nothing that is denyed. The testimony of <hi>Cyprian</hi> Epist. 59. is answered in my <hi>Examen</hi> pa. 1. Se. 7. To Mr. B. his question whether a whole Councel, and all the Church be ignorant whether infants were wont to be baptized 100. years before, when some of themselves or their Fathers were those infants? I answer, they might be ignorant, it being either not at all or very rarely in that time; nor is it known of what age the 66. Bishops of that Councel were when that Epist. was written, nor whose children they were, whether believers or infidels; nor in the whole Epistle is any thing historical set down about the ancient use of infant-baptism: but their determination of the lawfulnesse of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eighth day, which Epistle because <hi>Hierom, Augustin</hi> and others do so much alleadge as their prime testimony for baptizing infants for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of original sin, and I am taxed for calling it in my <hi>Ex.</hi> p. 1. s. 7. <hi>an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd Epist.</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>F. Rous</hi> in his late <hi>Abridgem. of the</hi> 1. <hi>Fathers</hi> hath left out that which was chiefly to have been inserted as the reason of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels determination, which <hi>Austin</hi> lib. 3. <hi>d'peccat. merit. &amp; remiss.</hi> c. 5. and elsewhere recites; I have therefore translated the whole Epistle into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and printed it in the end of this writing, not to shew the nakednesse of that Father, as I am accused but to clear the truth about the antiquity of Infant-baptism. But there is one testimony higher then <hi>Cyprian</hi> which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> urgeth with much earnestnesse as if he did triumph in it: and it is that of <hi>Pope Hyginus,</hi> who lived about the year 150. or 140. and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained something about Gossips at infant-baptism, which must needs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44370:8"/>
shew the Apostles baptized infants. To which I answer, 1. The decree in the Epistle as <hi>Osiander Epit. Hist. Eccl. cent.</hi> 2. lib. 2. c. 5. cites it out of <hi>Gratian to a word</hi> mentions not infant-baptism, though it speak of Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips which were at other times then infant-baptism. 2. Mr. B. might have taken notice, that <hi>Scultetus med. Patru. part</hi> 1. <hi>lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. saith, <hi>Of all the Epistles of the first Popes, No man that reads them attentively, but acknowledgeth them to be forged.</hi> The <hi>Contrary writers cent.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. judge the same, <hi>Osiander Epitome Eccl. Hist. Cent.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. calls the Author <hi>personatum Hyginum,</hi> and (as I remember) <hi>Rivet, Cook, James</hi> passe the like censure. <hi>Perkins preparative to the demonstration of the problems. These Epistles decretal, which passe under the names of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Evarist, Telesphorus, Hyginus, &amp; e. are all forged, and that for six reasons:</hi> yea Doctor <hi>Prideaux</hi> (whom Mr. B. alleadgeth for him) in his <hi>nineth Oration de Pseudoepigraphis Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>censures the decretal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles of the Ancient Popes as counterfeit.</hi> Lastly, Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi> in his <hi>Conference with Hart chap.</hi> 8. <hi>divis.</hi> 3. hath so fully proved in a large discourse the bastardise of them, that I could hardly have imagined any learned Protestant would ever have thus alleadged so notoriously forged a writing. So that I need not answer Mr. Bs. allegation of <hi>this testimony as by currant consent of Historians assuring us,</hi> and his questions thereor, but by telling him he hath reason to be ashamed of abusing men with this forgery after so much eviction of it by learned men, being more like to <hi>a brazen fac'd allegation,</hi> then that he so censures me for without cause: He next addes a speech of <hi>Tertullian de pudic.</hi> cap. 9. and translates it into English. <hi>Transgression in interpretation is not lesse then in conversation:</hi> which I know not why he adds but to shew the evil of my sin in interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I imagine, of Scripture: which had he demonstrated he had done more then yet hath been done by him, Mr. <hi>M.</hi> or any other. That inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation I give of 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7. 14. had sundry godly and learned Protestants, <hi>Melanchthor, Musculus, Camerarius, &amp;c.</hi> for it (whose words are printed in my <hi>Exercit.)</hi> before me, nor do Mr. <hi>B.</hi> his arguments or others take me off from it, but are answered in their place. Of my interpretation of <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. Mr. B. pag. 14. saith he will stand to most that I said of it. What I said of <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12. I intend to vindicate in its place. My way and course of interpreting Scripture hath been known where I have preached, at <hi>Oxford, Worcester, Lemster, Bristol, the Temple in London, Bewdley.</hi> If I make conscience of any thing, it is how I interpret Scripture. Mr. B. his interpretations of texts in this book are too grosse, as of <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10. <hi>Revel.</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:44370:9"/>

So farre as I am able to discern by his writings, Sermons and conference, his skill is better in reasoning and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying then interpreting Scripture, which I think he had need study better then I can yet perceive he hath done. He takes notice page 191. <hi>of an interpretation (as he is told) of mine of</hi> Mat. 11. 28. which he censures <hi>for a foule interpretation.</hi> He saith, <hi>Sure it is the guilt of sin, and accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and condemnation of the law with which persons are said to be weary and heavy laden.</hi> But I look for better assurance then Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> word. I confesse I finde nothing in the text for that sense: but the coherence with ver. 25, 26, 27. shewes ver. 28. to be an invitation to come to Christ as a Teacher, and ver. 29. is an expression of the end of coming to him, to <hi>take his yoke on them,</hi> that is, his doctrine and commands, which is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by learning of him: which is confirmed by the motive ver. 30. which is, that his <hi>yoke is easie and burden light:</hi> which can be understood of no other then his doctrine and commands, parallel to 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 3. as <hi>our translators, Beza, new Annot. Pareus, Piscator, Grotius,</hi> &amp;c. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. And he useth sundry arguments to draw them. 1. From the <hi>burdens</hi> on them, which I conceive to be rather meant (the whole context leading thereto) of such Burdens as are mentioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 3. then of sins which are not named. 2 From his <hi>mecknesse and low linesse,</hi> such as should be in a Teacher, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 24. opposed to harshnesse, superciliousnesse, disdaine, &amp;c. which is propounded rather as an encouragement to them to learne his doctrine, then (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and others) <hi>learn to be meek by my example.</hi> 3. From <hi>the rest they should find: to their soules,</hi> contrary to distraction and disquietnesse by Pharisaical doctrine. 4. From <hi>the ease of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> contrary to the rigorous impositions of those Doctors. And this interpretation seemes to me to be no <hi>foule interpretation,</hi> but so faire as that I can discerne no other in the words.</p>

Other considerations of the time of printing that book might have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned M. <hi>B.</hi> to have put that construction on my words, were he or any of my Antagonists willing to give my words or actions their due interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The other passages condemne me not till I be proved <hi>an agent for separation, seedesman of tares:</hi> which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> cannot prove, though he tells me pag. 188. <hi>he hath as good evidence that I am a Sect-Master as that I am a Christian, because I preach, dispute, talke, and endeavor as zealously to promote my opinion as I do for the Christian Faith.</hi> To which I answer, my opinion is no other then the command of Christ, and if we speak according to scripture, to preach for baptisme of believers is to preach for Christian faith. 2. Yet I deny that I preach with a like zeal for that particular point as for greater points of repentance from dead works, &amp; faith towards God in Christ incarnate, dead, risen, ascended, to come again, &amp;c. my <hi>Bewdley</hi> auditors besides others will I doubt not witnesse against this calumny. 3.

It proves we oft know an hypocrite by his actions, it is nothing at all to prove a false prophet by his evil manners. The other two

For his prooflies on this, <hi>That the yokew as put on Infants, and nothing was put on them but circumcision:</hi> but those passages speak of the ordinances of the Jewes, and with circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the legal ceremonies. If Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mean more by the <hi>yoke, Acts</hi> 15. 10. as the doctrines and commands, sure the Teachers did not put that on them till they taught them, which was not in infancy.

In his Epistle to the people of <hi>Bewdley</hi> he mentions <hi>a flame of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and discord at</hi> Bewdley <hi>blown by my breath, and that he came to quench it by the importunity of their Magistrate, Minister, and many of their people.</hi> And his words are often enforced with such aggravating expressions, as make people specially afarre off imagine, that at <hi>Bewdley</hi> there is a great schisme and discord made by my preaching; whereas there was no such discord as I know of: yea I think afore the dispute the godly did walk together in publique hearing, publique and private prayer, and conference while I was with them and since, as lovingly as in any other places. And though all do not joine in breaking of bread, some going to the Parson, others declining him as a stranger to the private meetings of the godly, and an adversary to such godly preachers as from time to time

they had gotten for the Chappel, and a temporizer with the kings party while the Town was under their power went to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to <hi>Kederminster,</hi> others being baptized have joined with me: yet all of them meet together for repetition and conference, and when I am with them I think in greater number then in my absence, and do embrace my doctrine with lesse break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into <hi>Antinomian, Familistical, Ranting</hi> errors or practises then at <hi>Kederminster.</hi> The discord of most note hath been between two men and their wives, who were by consent or connivence of their husbands baptized, and brake bread with us, till Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> book came forth: which charging us with schism for reforming our selves, and affrighting people with the danger of our way as leading to error they are kept from our soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; which is a manifest separation to avoid an imaginary, of which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is the chief author; and I may truly say if there be any such flame of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord at <hi>Bewdley,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> meanes, it is blown by Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> breath, not mine, who am conscious to my self of being as studious of unity (as I can, with preservation of truth.

               <p>THe chief points in Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> book he would have observed, in their places shall be (God willing) fully examined: For the present only thus much. My Confession that all should be admitted Church-members by baptisme, was meant of such as by their profession are visible, not of such as are visible in Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> way without profession. The repeal of the Law or ordinance for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants visible Church-membership will be easily proved when the law or ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is shewed. As yet I can find no such law or ordinance save what is injoyned concerning circumcision; which if it stand in force, we must <hi>keep the whole law, Gal.</hi> 5. 3 His first challenge is answered by another chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to shew what one church had infants visible Church-members besides the Jewes. His second is answered by shewing till <hi>Abrahams</hi> time there is nothing said about any church-frame; from <hi>Abrahams</hi> time till <hi>Christs</hi> the <hi>Jewish</hi> church-frame stood: In <hi>Christs</hi> time and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles no other are reckoned to belong to the visible Church, then professors of faith. And so it continued till infants were admitted to baptism to save them, which out of the case of danger of present dying was disswaded by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian and Gregory Nazianzen.</hi> Afterwards their baptisme was more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent through <hi>Austins</hi> urging it so much against the <hi>Pelegians,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> rightly observed long since, &amp; together with it infant-communion was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, yet not without the continuance of the old form of putting the question to infants, after which at first profession was declared, &amp; catechizing mostly afore they were baptized at certain seasons of the year till ignorance and confusion overspread the Churches. But when God began to stirre up any to reform other corruptions, there were that sought to reform this 500. years ago, according to truth, notwithstanding Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ms.</hi> or Doctor <hi>Ushers</hi> allegations: of whom I perswade my self many may be met with in heaven notwithstanding M. <hi>Bs.</hi> confident expressions to the contrary. Yet were all Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sayes true, if I put Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to the like, as to shew me since the Apostles, one that questioned keeping of an Easter, Lent fast, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-communion, Monkish profession, &amp;c. till the last age he will be hard put to it. His considerations depend upon the points in dispute: in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of which it may appear how frivolous his questions are. Infants Church-membership I find no where but in the peculiar national policy of the Jewes, no universal law or ordinance, for it; the Jewish policy is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away both <hi>de facto</hi> by the providence of God, and <hi>de jure</hi> of right by
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44370:11"/>
the declaration of Christ and his Apostles in the <hi>N. T.</hi> and by altering the way of Church-gathering and constitution. The Jewes were hainously offended at the taking away of circumcision, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he took away Churchmembership of infants, but because of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Temple, Priesthood, &amp;c in which they gloried, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 20, 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 13, 14. If it be true, that it was a known trueth, that infants were visihle Church-members, and to be admitted Disciples, and the Apostles did not admit them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 13 (which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> supposeth) then the challenge is answered, <hi>Name me away from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation till</hi> 200. <hi>years age, who did once question infants Church-member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?</hi> For after Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> dictates the Apostles did so. Let men <hi>turne over their Bibles,</hi> they will finde enough in them against infants visible Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membership in the <hi>N. T.</hi> He askes, <hi>Why the speech,</hi> Marke 16. 16. <hi>which excludes infants from baptisme, should not also exclude them from sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for want of believing?</hi> To which I answer, It is not doubted but that infants belong to the invisible Kingdome of the Elect <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 14. but how they attain salvation is not so certain: If by a seed of faith or holinesse without actual exercise, the thing is more easie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: if by actual exercise extraordinarily and immediately wrought by the Holy Spirit, then the speeches, <hi>He that believeth not, shall be damned,</hi> and the like, do exclude infants from salvation if not believing actually; if by vertue of election without any work on them, if by vertue of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant their parents believing (which some assert, but I professe to know no such Covenant) then the speeches, <hi>He that believeth not, shall be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> with the like, must be understood with this limitation, He of those to whom the Gospel is preached that believeth not shall be damned. For my part, I do much in cline to that opinion, which conceives <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 16. <hi>John</hi> 3. 18. and such like, to be understood of belief &amp; unbelief of those of years, who have the Gospel preached to them because the course of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text leads thereto. Which being premised, I answer to the question, That infants are excluded from baptisme from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 15, 16. compared together, because these texts shew that according to Christs institution, they that are to be baptized are to be Disciples or known pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed believers, and baptisme belongs onely to whom Christ appoints it. Yet these texts do not exclude infants from salvation, because either it excludes professed unbelievers, not non-believers negatively from incapacity, or it excludes unbelievers that are in no sort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, neither in the seed nor fruite, neither byordinary, nor by extraordinary operation; in one of which wayes infants
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44370:12"/>
are or may be believers, and so not excluded by that text, if belief and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief comprehend all these wayes in that place. To his question, <hi>What great comfort would follow this conclusion [that all your infants are out of Christs visible Church] that men should bend their wits so to prove it?</hi> I answer, The question might be retorted, What great comfort would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this conclusion [that all our infants are by nature children of wrath] that men should bend their wits so to prove it? 2. The answer I suppose Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would give to the one will fit us, that whether it be matter of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or discomfort, we must maintain truth. To another passage of his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, <hi>That to be visibly in the Church is all one as (to our judgement) to belong to Christs Kingdome,</hi> I answer by denying it, and doubt not to shew how this mistake hath much misled Mr. <hi>B.</hi> when I examine the 27. chap. of the <hi>first part of his book.</hi> We can prove that Christ will save his elect though no Christians in appearance, nor disciples by profession, nor visibly subjects of his Kingdome. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> talkes vainly of <hi>the judgements of Gods Ministers and Churches in all ages of the world,</hi> when as their judgement is proved by my writings to have been, and to be at this day so various about infant-baptisme; I have little hope to conceive Mr. <hi>B.</hi> by my writings, which he sleights so much as to say, <hi>That the best part of my bookes is Ink and Paper.</hi> Men not inferiour to Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and one I am sure farre beyond Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in disputes, judged otherwise. Were not Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mounted to an height of disdainful pride, me thinks he might have spied the clearing of some Scriptures, and other things more worth then the Ink and Paper. It is his uncharitable conceit of me, if he imagine <hi>I write to have the last word:</hi> it is to shew his grosse a buse of Scripture, and his fallacies of reasoning. If he out-live this answer I now am making, any time he may have the last word if he will for me, who am weary with meddling with such a distemper'd writer. <hi>I blame not Mr. B. for printing:</hi> but for printing my answers afore I had fitted them to his arguments in writing, as Doctor <hi>Rainolds</hi> dealt with <hi>Hart,</hi> which (saith he in <hi>his preface to his conference with</hi> Hart) <hi>learned men have thought to be most fit for trial of truth, not by extemporal speaking, but writing with advise the question argued of, the arguments, the answers, the replies set down, and sifted of both sides till each had fully said; in fine, the whole published, that the Churches and the faithfull all may judge of it.</hi> Such a rule was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed also <hi>in the conference at the Hague,</hi> and in all other profitable Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies about points in controversie; to all which Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> dealing with me hath bin altogether unlike. Nor is he excused by telling me <hi>he had a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of my sermon, and had conference with me.</hi> For besides other exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44370:12"/>
this excuse takes not away, it is very apparent that neither in the dispute nor in that conference his judgement about infants Discipleship and Church-visibility, and other points in his book could be discerned so as to know determinately what to oppose. Which makes me glad of the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his book however, though for the present I suffer much by it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting but I shall be able to shew the wickednesse of his writing, so as that all that are willing may see, that whosoever leanes on his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to justifie their infant-baptisme, rests on a broken reed that will run into his hands.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44370:13"/>
the dispute: I confesse the conference at Col. <hi>Taylors</hi> house 1646. and the reading of his arguments (as was said) 1647. but the conference being not written, nor the notes then in my hand, there were left onely some imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and obscure apprehensions of them in me, which in respect of giving a distinct answer were all one as if I knew them not at all: by reason of which I was very desirous to get his arguments in writing, that I might be the better able to answer them, and satisfie others; which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> not yielding to, I could not give answer, but on the sudden without premeditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the arguments being gone from me, like <hi>Nehuchad-nezzars</hi> dream, and I did imagine, and accordingly used these words in a letter, <hi>It was said, you would hide your weapon till you were to use it;</hi> In which opinion his taking hold of so many indirect ways for advantages to possesse mens minds with his opinion, and to hinder a free examination of what is said on both sides do confirme me. And that things may be apprehended nakedly as they were, I do acknowledge, that it is my disposition, be it dulnesse or weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to pause on a new argument whether in reading or conference, so that I cannot oft-times give a clear answer to an argument I have not bin used to on a sudden, no nor many times to an argument I have been versed in, when it is not under my eye, when other matters possesse my memory, when fear of speaking ineptly doth benumme me and hinder my elocution, when I have some obscure notion of a fallacy which at present I cannot readily discover. Which knowledge of my self made me unwilling to come to a publick dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute or extemporal conference with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> whom I had found in conferences I had with him to be quick in apprehension and expression, various and copious in multiplying arguments and expressions, captious of advantages, ready to expose even to contempt, with shew of disdain, those that speak not according to his mind, which made me conceive I should neither well remember, nor weigh his arguments afore I must answer, nor clear truth, nor satisfie my self or others, but occasion glorying in Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and settling people in his error. Neverthelesse presaging by his declining to argue by writing and his words in his letter <hi>Sept. 6.

By this true relation the truth of my intimation of the suddenness of the assault, my ignorance of his arguments, my speeches concerning his concealing his arguments, provoking me to dispute are verified, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of my desiring his arguments in writing, the cause of varying my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers at the dispute, and why to so weake arguments no fuller answers were then given, and why I said at <hi>Bewdley</hi> (which I still think) I preached nothing but truth to them, are assigned: about all which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to misrepresent me and my proceedings in his <hi>History of the conception of his Treatise.</hi> As for Mr. <hi>Bs. inclination now to think me a very proud man</hi> however he thought heretofore, and that I have <hi>higher thoughts of my self then was meete, because of my dissent from so many Churches and God'y Divines,</hi> and because of my answer in private to him about the reason I gave why the error of infant-baptisme being easie to be discerned was not discerned through wilfulnesse or negligence, I say 1. My dissent is not singular, nor my reasons and writings such but that such a one as my self might be allowed to hold my tenet without imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of selfe-conceitednesse, arrogance, &amp;c. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> varies from Churches and learned men about justification and faith in his <hi>Aphorismes:</hi> what he can say for himself why he should not be censured as he censures me may perhaps be my plea. I cannot alter my own judgement or others but by arguments, nor dare I say I do see what I do not. 2. As for my speech in private (which me thinks it was somewhat against the lawes of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship for him thus to publish) I know not what better answer yet to give, but to ascribe it to prejudice, or faction or some such like cause that men are so wilful or negligent as not to examine and discerne the errour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism so manifestly discernable by applying to it their own rules

and positions in reformation of Popish and Prelatical corruptions. And I do conceive the same or like answer would be given about the Lutherans holding consubstantiation, images to be retained in Temples, ubiquity of Christs body, conditional predestination, and sundry the like tenets: which may be a just censure without pride. That which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saies, <hi>[And lest my touching that controversy though at a distance might irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him to fall upon it, I never spake one word (to my best remembrance) in my congregation of it to this day, for fear of giving any occasion of difference</hi> page 209. <hi>I never preached one sentence before the dispute, nor since to his hearers or mine that I can remember on the question.</hi> Page 281. <hi>I never spake one word against his opinion in my pulpit to this day]</hi> shewes his memory retaines not all he printed in his <hi>Saints everlisting rest,</hi> preached on the Lecture-dayes at <hi>Kederminster.</hi> As page 534. <hi>We should see the promises made good to our seed, and the unthankful Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, that will not confesse, That the children of the Saints are any nearer to God or more beholding to him then Pagans, so much as for the favour to be visible Churchmembers, should by sweet experience be convinced of their errour, and be taught better how to understand that all our children are holy.</hi> Page 518. He calls the disputes about baptism <hi>perverse and fierce,</hi> which did so directly touch the controversy as might irritate me to fall on it at <hi>Bewdley,</hi> and make those that told me think he did gird at me, which he denies pag. 166. He mentions a speech of mine to Mr. <hi>D.</hi> whom he terms <hi>a godly man [that truth is not to be suspended for peace]</hi> and saith, <hi>When the times changed</hi> (which his words page 220. interpret to be meant, <hi>When the ordinance against heresies and errors ceased to be in force) I spake against Infant-sprinkling, prest them to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized again, mentioned in Sermons Mr.</hi> M. <hi>Mr.</hi> Blake, <hi>and himself, when my doctrine prevailed not (though since I have gotten above 20. rebap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized disciples, whom I often visit and confirm) that I charged them with hypocrisy, with their blood on their heads, that M.</hi> Ms. <hi>plea from circumcision for infant-baptism is heresie, that by my definition of heresy Independants must be judged Hereticks, that I sought his arguments in writing to put them in my Review of the dispute with Mr.</hi> M. <hi>and to ing age him in the Controversy; whence he gathered I was unpeaceable, set to carry on my opinion, and to make my self a party.</hi> To all this I reply. 'Tis true some conceiving Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his speeches had a fling at me, and it seeming likely to me, I did speak to the purpose Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saies I did, not imagining that a speech upon a conference in a shop without its limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and cautions should have been (as it is by Mr. <hi>B.)</hi> published and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44370:14"/>
as my error: but indeed willing only that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should know, that in my case I was not to suspend my asserting of truth for fear of losing of peace, as I alleadge in my <hi>Apology</hi> sect. 3. And I professe I wonder that such as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and others that were so earnest against <hi>Bishops</hi> and ceremonies though warres did follow, and had a great hand in putting them on, should now, the warres being so well abated, be so impatient that Infant-sprinkling is questioned. It is untruely surmifed that the change of times was the cause of my opening my self fully in the congregation at <hi>Bewdley.</hi> My first meddling with it was when Mr. <hi>Bayly</hi> had so unjustly charged me in his <hi>Anabaptisme</hi> chap. 4. page 92. with <hi>spoiling infants of all interest in the Covenant of grace, making circumcision a seale to the Jewes only of earthly priviledges, denying to the Jewish infants all right to the Covenant till in their riper years they become actual believers.</hi> Which with other fals accusations about twenty in that one page I intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by letter my dear Father-in-Law Mr. <hi>Henry Scudder</hi> to advertise him of: after that I might stand right in the thoughts of that worthy man Mr. <hi>William Hopkins</hi> of <hi>Bewdley</hi> (now with God) I shewed him how he wronged me, and then cleared my self in my cursory exposition on <hi>Ger.</hi> 17. brought his book with me into the pulpit, and read a passage of Mr. <hi>Ms. Defence</hi> part. 3. page 98. for my vindication, which was presently sent up to London. But Mr. <hi>Bayly</hi> doing nothing to right me, I wrote to Mr. <hi>Bayly,</hi> and because Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> had my letter to send to him, I wrote since to him to know what became of my letter, but have had no answer. After this I was moved to preach what I did (which was but little till <hi>December</hi> 1649.) when I found my tenet on the day of fast to be humbled for blasphemies and heresies (which was as I remember <hi>March</hi> 10. 1649.) reckoned as by others so by Mr. <hi>Obadiah Sedgewick</hi> in his <hi>Sermon before the Lords among heresies,</hi> (with which I found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>censure of 52. Ministers about London to concurre</hi> stigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing me by name as holding <hi>four pernicious errors in my Examen)</hi> and when the ordinance against blasphemy and heresie was published; which Mr. <hi>Boraston</hi> though not required, yet published at <hi>Ribsford</hi> (to which <hi>Bewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Chappel</hi> relates) that he might proclaime me an Heretick. Which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated me to speak what I did, not <hi>the change of times</hi> (it's known I spake as much in the hardest times to my opinion as since) nor <hi>unpeacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse in me,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> surmised. What I preached was in no cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourous manner (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would intimate, calling it <hi>exclaiming)</hi> but in a way of proof and answer as sober Divines do in the like case. My na ming any was when I recited their words: for which though I was reviled
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44370:15"/>
once in <hi>London</hi> when refuting Doctor <hi>Crisp</hi> I named him, and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in a letter to me, and since in print reckons as no small fault, yet I ever did, and do still think it to be necessary, when the books are in mens hands, and the Auditors are not likely otherwise to know we recite their opinion truly, nor whose error we refute. I do not believe I used those words Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sets down as mine <hi>[Let them budge at it, &amp;c.]</hi> though it's likely I might say, it's one of the chiefest signes of sincerity to embrace every truth, and hypocrisy not to receive it for carnal respects; not out of anger that men were not of my mind, but to justify my self after I had fully handled the point about baptism (which I think was either after or immediately before the dispute) I used the Apostles words, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 26, 27. nor do I deny that sith our Lord Christ doth, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. make baptisme some condition of Salvation, I think those that are taught that Infant-sprinkling is not the duty Christ requires of being baptized, and that water baptisme of men at years upon profession of faith is a necessary duty (which I had sufficiently proved at <hi>Bewdley)</hi> and yet neglect it, do hazzard their salvation living in disobedience to a manifest duty, yea the prime duety whereby they ought solemnly to engage themselves to be Christs Disciples. I have <hi>gotten no Disciples to me,</hi> and though more then 20 in <hi>Bewdley</hi> have bin baptized after profession of faith since my removal from them (whom with the whole Town I think my self bound by many ties as often as I may to visit and confirm) yet not rebaptized. It is true to shew how unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the accusation of my tenet as heresy is, I have sundry times said that Mr. <hi>Ms.</hi> position in his <hi>Sermon</hi> page 35. <hi>[That all Gods commands and institutions about the Sacraments of the Jewes bind us as much as they did them, in all things which belong to the substance of the Covenant, and were not accidentall unto them]</hi> is one of the most manifest heresies being condemned, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. For it expressely asserts that the Gentile Christians are still bound to some rule of circumcision, contrary to the Apostles deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. Nor did I <hi>frame a definition of heresie to make good what I said of Mr.</hi> Ms. <hi>tene,</hi> though I deny not the definition I gave with some explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my meaning: of which what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath in his <hi>Corrective</hi> page 259, 260. is not much short. Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> inference thereupon that <hi>by my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition Independents are Heretick,</hi> followes not. For though they erre, yet that they make a party for their error is unknown to me: although wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of alteration with Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as acquainted with his temper I replyed not. If I desired Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> animadversions on my writings, that I might see all worth answering and put it in my <hi>Review,</hi> it was no more unreasonable in me to desire then in Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to desire the like afore his reprinting his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorismes,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:44370:15"/>
nor any more folly in him to have gratifyed me then, then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersto gratifie him with the like; but had been a very friendly &amp; neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part in him to one, who was very glad to gratify him or his neighbours in any thing meet for me, as I deny not (excepting this) he and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were to gratify me. After his denial of his animadversions I think I came to his Lecture sundry times though not so often as formerly, because of my much absence from <hi>Bewdley.</hi> To conclude, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> found me not <hi>adverse to the Churches peace,</hi> but only his uncharitable surmises imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me so. And I desire the Reader to take notice that in all this he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth me with, there is no one act of separation from whence he should conclude so hardly of me as he doth.</p>

               <p>THe next part of the History is about the occasion and mannaging of the dispute, to most of which an answer may be gathered out of my letter to him <hi>Sept.</hi> 10. of which so much as is needful is printed at the end of this writing.

If I had a designe to answer his arguments in my <hi>Review</hi> it had been an honest designe, and hansomer then Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> printing my answers to his arguments afore he had them from me in writing.

                     </gap>fence</hi> was defective. I professed not a full answer to Mr. <hi>Blake,</hi> but gave short advertisements in my <hi>Postscript</hi> with reasons why I did so, which I yet count sufficient for answer to that piece, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Mr. <hi>B.</hi> imagine of it. <hi>I slubber'd over</hi> nothing (as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and one Mr. <hi>George Milward in a letter to one Capt. Freema</hi> charge me). If I do not write so quick as M. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> &amp;c. it is from my unsettled condition, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall imployments, the multitude of them that write against me, though I earnestly intreated that I might see the strength of all together, (which motion had been fit for them that were desirous to have truth take place, and not make use of advantages to hinder the cleering of it) the difficulty and charge of printing, which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> can easily perhaps have done, people being averse from the truth I hold, and willing to sell or buy or reade any thing against me, but not what is for me. That in my <hi>Sermons at Bewdley I culled out the weakest arguments,</hi> is most false: to the best of my skill I produced the best arguments I met with in their strength, and as much as I could in the Authors words. Mr. <hi>Cobbets</hi> book being a loose discourse for the most part, having many passages, and expressions proper to the way of <hi>N. E.</hi> filled with dictates unproved, much of it against <hi>f. S. H. D.</hi> &amp;c. whose speeches and arguments I am not engaged to maintain, I do not bind my self to answer. If I might be allowed to passe my judgement freely, notwithstanding Mr. <hi>Cottons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwins,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> conceits of it, I should say, that I do not perceive in the matter of it any such strength as needs much answering, and that the method and expressions are such as that it cannot well be answered without lopping off many superfluous branches, enquiring into his meaning in many of his expressions which are cloudy (which would be extreamly tedious to the answerer and reader, and liable to much exception) and reducing it into a more scholastical forme; were it by himself shaped into a succinct treatise like Mr. <hi>Nortons</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius,</hi> and should be willng to answer it, if I found any thing in it, which I had not answered before: But I would not have the Reader expect me to answer that again, which in some of my writings is formerly answered, and in which he might by reading heedfully satisfie himself: Yet I did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the chief of his arguments in those Sermons, and I intend to answer what else I meet with in them, that is opposed to my <hi>Examen,</hi> and what ever else I shall conceive is necessary to be answered. I little expected to satisfie Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who I found had prejudice in him, which was not denied by him. Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> name was used with respect onely in citing his words in his <hi>Aphorismes,</hi> which I never dreamt would be taken for an injury. His censuring mens writings and confuting them in pulpit without naming them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44370:16"/>
or citing their words as it is lesse offensive, so it is lesse edifying. Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> prosperity and my conceived failings at the dispute (which will appear to be Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> mistakes in the answer of his arguments in print) were ordered by the Almighties providence for humbling me, and discovery of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> spirit then (which must be refereed to the judgement of the hearers) and since (which Readers may perceive) yet I hope according to the strange-windings of his providence, as in <hi>Josephs</hi> case, for the advancement of the truth he opposeth. The Ministers about Mr. <hi>B.</hi> at the dispute were all of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> party sent for up and down all the Countrey, such as they were, if they may be reputed Ministers, or men that mind the things of Christ: of whom no marvel Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was cried up, I taunted with dulnesse, it serving for their ends to keep up their esteeme: one or two of better account sate further off, yet of Mr. Bs. judgement. That I did not bearken to Mr. <hi>Borastons</hi> motion for Mr. Bs. preaching, it was because I knew it would be likely to stirre up passion, and settle prejudice in the people (in which I find by that he hath printed chap. 1. 2. especially in the very beginning I was not mistaken) and I hoped to bring the dispute to writing, which is the best way to clear truth, and I suspected (as I had cause) Mr. <hi>Borastons</hi> and the then <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and those reputed godly persons</hi> devices and motions, which were then by many conceived to be contrived for the Parsons endes, the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his power and profits by keeping up that rite which ingratiates the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and formal persons to him. Whereunto that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath been sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient is the grief of many, and might well befit Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to repent of. When I saw I could not get Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> arguments in writing, I got what notes I could of the dispute from others writing or my own memory; and knowing that vauntes were given out of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> victory, I did as well as I could summe up his arguments, and answer them <hi>Jan.</hi> 20. and after went to him upon his motion <hi>Jan.</hi> 25. to confer with him, which was friendly on both sides; yet that which I hoped and I conceived he promised, that though he would not send me his arguments in writing (which I again moved) yet he would transcribe them for such as should come to him to be resolved in that point, after sundry puttings off was not obtained: But instead thereof in <hi>March</hi> the weeke afore I removed from <hi>Bewdley</hi> I met with the passage in his Epistle Dedicatory to the people of <hi>Kederminster,</hi> to which I after opposed my <hi>Valedictory Oration in</hi> Bewdley <hi>chappel</hi> March. 17. 1649. and printed the same in effect in my <hi>Antidote</hi> in <hi>May</hi> following. Now Mr. <hi>B.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadgeth <hi>he had reason for his not sending his arguments to me to keep me from erring they being not desired, for my self, but my people, I remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very confident of my self, that when I sent to him I heap'd so many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44370:17"/>
about matters of fact I knew, that he durst not answer me lest the very naming my untruths might cause me to say, he reproached or railed, that his conference was with me in private, because he thought my pride of spirit would not permit me to confesse truth openly, that he wrote the passage in his Epistle to</hi> Kederminster <hi>out of zeale for God, compassion to mens souls, my opinion and preaching being like to do more hurt against the Church of God, then drunkards and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, and therefore he had cause to be bitter in his writing.</hi> To all which speeches I reply, He had reason to conceive I desired satisfaction for my self by my desiring his Animadversions, and by my letter to him <hi>Sept.</hi> 10. If not, yet to have given them in writing, which he had as he saies before, at <hi>Coventrey</hi> preached and were ready by him, had been a neighbourly part to men that were his frequent hearers. But his prejudice against my opinion and uncharitable conceit of my pride (as heretofore Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ley</hi> interpreted my most equal motion in humility of spirit in the end of my <hi>Examen</hi> to be the challenge of a <hi>braving Goliath,</hi> so now any opposing what's determined by Synods and leading writers must be condemned as comming from pride) are a sufficient reason not to gratify me, but to do what he can against me, and this must be counted zeale for God, and his insolent bitternesse justifiable, as being in pretence against a pernicious sin not yet proved, but indeed against a truth discovering an error, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the prime ordinance of Christianity is miserably corrupted. He speaks of a <hi>fearful passion a feaver of passion I was in when I first read the passage in his Epistle against Anabaptists, such as he would not be infor all my revenues, if I had not a free vent for my spleen in pulpit and presse he doubts it might have spoiled me.</hi> 'Tis true when I first read it unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly in Mr. <hi>Ds.</hi> house, I was stirred in my spirit out of the sense of the wrong done to me and the truth by it, and not meeting with the book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I wrote out the passage: but that by word or carriage I shewed such passion as he speaks of I am certain is his tale-tellers addition, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science may perhaps one day tell him of his ill Offices in opposing truth, and nourishing differences between me and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath a jerke at <hi>my Revenues,</hi> by which he would have the world believe it is very great, and such as were desirable for himself: whereas his outward estate consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his being an unplundered, or not much plundered single young man heir of a good estate in Land, besides his sequestration is more likely to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice his uses then my estate my uses, though I blesse God it is better with me through the favour of some eminent persons sensible of my hard usuage, then it would have been if the party opposite to me had prevailed, and I could

reasonably hope; when for no other cause but the publishing of my <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> my remove from the <hi>Temple</hi> in <hi>Londen</hi> with my wife and children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a hundred miles in the middest of winter was necessitated.

He tells me in print of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Parson of Rosse, Vicar of Lemster, Preacher of Bewdley, Master of the Hospital of Ledbury, besides meanes of my own, and yet complaining of want I and my family might be put to in my bookes,</hi> and he addes, <hi>You made so light of having no lesse then four market-townes to lie on your shoulders as if it were nothing, and then sath Pious sober men think it his duty to say what he did.</hi> To which I reply. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> is taken for a <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sober man,</hi> yet in his <hi>Defence</hi> of his <hi>sermon</hi> page 3. he accused me most deeply of a <hi>Socianian plot of questioning all conclusions inferr'd by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from scripture;</hi> the injury of which I shewed in my <hi>Apology</hi> sect. 11. yea his own words in his <hi>Defence</hi> pag. 205. <hi>You neither there nor here deny this argument from a consequence to be sufficient for practice of some things in the worship of God, which are not expressely laid down in the N.

The like may I say of Mr. <hi>Robert Baillee of Glas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow in Scotland</hi> notwithstanding his false criminations before mentioned, and my writing to him about them. How Mr. <hi>Geree</hi> used me is shewed in my <hi>Apology</hi> sect. 6. yet his <hi>Vindiciae vindiciarum</hi> was presently after published without any shew of remorse of conscience for what he did. And now Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells me, <hi>pious and sober men advise him to say</hi> that which as he puts it down is false and exceeding injurious to me, to wit, <hi>that I had foure market-townes on my shoulders,</hi> which every one will interpret to be 4. beneficial places under my charge together, <hi>besides meanes of my own, and yet complain in my bookes of want I and my family may be put to.</hi> Whereas the truth is, there are no words that have a shew of complaint (which yet indeed are not querulous but onely narrative) but those in the close of my <hi>Examen</hi> and <hi>Apology,</hi> and neither of them, when I enjoyed any thing at <hi>Lemster, Bewdley, Rosse or Ledbury;</hi> but the former was <hi>anno</hi> 1644. when all my estate was in the enemies power, and my small stipend at <hi>Eanchurch</hi> withdrawn by reason of my not practising Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme; the other when I was to leave the Temple for publishing my <hi>Examen anno</hi> 1646. when the Counties to which I had relation, were but newly reduced to the obedience of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And then I assay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to returne to <hi>Lemster,</hi> where I had been almost totally plundred <hi>anno</hi> 1642. and yet so great was the Antipathy of some men against me, that I could neither get reparation for my losses, nor allowance for building

'Tis true some pittying my condition gave me the rent of the rectory of <hi>Rosse</hi> anno 1646. which having a Vicar endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Rectory leased out with the Rectors house, they gave it me with expectation of preaching only some sermons there as I could; but being invited to <hi>Bewdley</hi> I accepted of the invitation, and though the maintenance were but finall, and the years dear, and my charges great in refurnishing my house and study, yet I rested contented therewith till the Deane and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Worcesters</hi> landes being to be sold, out of which the best part of my maintenance did arise, the providence of God cast on me the Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Hospital of <hi>Ledbury,</hi> which doth not tie me to the charge of soules, much lesse puts the market-towne on my shoulders. and then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently I yielded up my interest in <hi>Rosse</hi> though some of the godly there were very unwilling I should. And when my pay ended at <hi>Bewdley</hi> the Lord opened a way for my returne to <hi>Lemster,</hi> and provision was made for me there.

And for his conjecture it may be answered by another conjecture, that it seems rather <hi>Berengarius</hi> did at first discerne the vanity of infants baptisme as arising from <hi>Austins</hi> errour about the necessity of it, and not much used till after his daies: yet finding the opposition of the corporal presence in the Eucharist too hard a businesse being forced to recant by <hi>Pope Nicholas,</hi> it's likely he concealed his opinion of infant-baptisme; to which conjecture <hi>Cassanders</hi> conceit in his preface to the <hi>Duke of Gulick and Cleve</hi> before his <hi>Testimonies for infant-baptisme</hi> is somewhat like, <hi>That though he overthrew baptism of little ones, yet he brought it not into publique, because as</hi> Guitmund <hi>saies, He knew, That the eares of the worst men would not brook that blasphemy.</hi> I also related a speech of the same <hi>Cassander</hi> concerning the <hi>Albigenses,</hi> besides which in my <hi>Exercitation</hi> I alleadged the words of <hi>Lucas Osiander</hi> accusing the <hi>Albigenses</hi> as agreeing with <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists.</hi> And to shew that there was some reason for what I averred, to wit that there were others that made head against infant-baptisme before <hi>Baltasar Pacimontanus,</hi> I alleadged <hi>Bernard Serm.</hi> 66. in <hi>Cantica.

is by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself page 265. stiled a <hi>pious man. Petrus Cluniacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> was though a zealous Papist, yet thought fit by <hi>Illyricus</hi> to be reckoned among <hi>Witnesses of Truth</hi> in his <hi>Catalogue.</hi> They are as impartial Authors (specially <hi>Bernard)</hi> as that age yielded; if these be not taken for witnesses of things in their times, I know not how Protestants will make up their Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of witnesses for them in all ages. Protestant writers do frequently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge these very Authors for other things. <hi>Mornay</hi> in his <hi>Mysterie of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity progress.</hi> 46. cites these very writings against Papists. I conceive Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> think they said true, when <hi>Bernard</hi> charged them that they <hi>derided prayer for the dead, invocation of Saints, Purgatory:</hi> and <hi>Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacensis</hi> that they <hi>excepted against Altars, adoring of Crosses, the Masse, chanting inquires, praying for the dead.</hi> If they be to be believed in so many, why not in this, which they put first? <hi>Lucas Osiander Epit. Hist. Eccl. Cent.</hi> 12. lib. 3. cap. 3. <hi>anno Christi</hi> 1158. cites <hi>Clunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censis</hi> for the same thing. <hi>Eckbertus</hi> saith when he was <hi>Canou at</hi> Bon <hi>he with his Companion</hi> Bertoly <hi>did often speak with them whom he refutes,</hi> sayes <hi>in his Sermon that they alleadged against Infant-baptisme Mat.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 15, 16. Though I make no question but that they bely them at least some of them in other things, some upon report, as <hi>Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacansis,</hi> that <hi>they denyed some of the Scripture,</hi> it may be saith <hi>Osia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, because they denyed the Apocryphal writings,</hi> or perhaps <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they denied arguments valid from the rites of the old Testament;</hi> some upon false inferences, which is a frequent thing in writers to make the consequences they gather from their writings the tenets of the Authors they impugne; some it may be out of that abuse of charging those tenets and practises upon all of the same profession, which is too true of some, as that all Christians did lewd practises, because the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> did so, that all Anabaptists are wicked because those of <hi>Munster, Copp,</hi> and some others proved so, in which way Mr. <hi>B.</hi> walkes page 138. &amp;c. (for which the Lord forgive him) yet it seemes utterly unlikely to me, that in this <hi>Petrus de Bruis and Henricus</hi> and their followers should be belied, when so many of chief account in their time from several places charge them with denying infant-baptisme, and rebaptizing, <hi>Petrus Cluniacensis</hi> writes to 3. <hi>Bishops of France, and Bernard</hi> to the <hi>Earle of St. Gyles</hi> of purpose against them for this reason, <hi>Bernard and Cluniacensiis</hi> put it for their prime error, <hi>Petrus Cluniacensis and Eckbertus</hi> produce, and take on them to answer their allegations against infant-baptisme, but not so (as I remember) any allegations against the Scriptures or Marriage,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44370:20"/>
which they charge them to deny, and therefore it's likely they wrong them in these, not in that. As for the <hi>Albigenses</hi> and <hi>Waldenses,</hi> it might be true that some might be against Infant-baptisme, yet others not, some fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> others <hi>Waldus;</hi> as it was in the reformation, when some followed <hi>Luther,</hi> others <hi>Zwinglius</hi> in the points of the Eucharist, Images, &amp;c. or it may be that they all at the beginning held so, but after left it, which seemes to be the conceit of <hi>Cassander ubi suprà.</hi> And yet in the old book wherein their doctrince is cited by <hi>Illyricus</hi> in his <hi>Catalog. test. verit.</hi> printed <hi>Argentinae</hi> 1562. <hi>pag.</hi> 3, 4. there are some speeches, which <hi>Illyricus</hi> is faine by glosses to free from the opinion of Antipaedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme: But whether the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were Antipaedopatists or no what I did alleadge was rightly done, not with a <hi>brazen face</hi> or <hi>seared conscience,</hi> or <hi>out of a desire to take up any slaunder</hi> or <hi>joine with any party to defend my cause,</hi> as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> doth most unbrotherly insinuate, yea in my <hi>Examen</hi> part. 2. sect. 2. before I cite <hi>Bernard</hi> and <hi>Cluniacensis,</hi> I have these words: <hi>Now although he charge them with denying marriage &amp; abstaning from meates, yet you may smell out of his own words that this was but a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny:</hi> but because by the reasons given I am induced to conceive not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding Mr. <hi>Ms.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> allegations that <hi>Peter de Bruis</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricus,</hi> and other godly persons and societies were 500. yeares ago Antipae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptists; yea I conceive as good a catalogue of Antipaedobaptists may be made almost in all ages as may be made for Protestants against many Popish corruptions, and better then Antiprelatists can make against Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy. And this I dare still to do, and marvel Mr. <hi>B.</hi> dare bring such railing accusation, to which I onely returne, <hi>The Lord rebuke him.</hi> The other <hi>untruth</hi> if not <hi>malice</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> chargeth me with, is concerning my dealing with himself, when I had in my <hi>Valedictory Sermon</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote</hi> shewed how impertinently the 2. monsters in <hi>New England</hi> were brought as evidences of Gods judgements against Anabaptists I added in my Sermon, one of the errors condemned in <hi>New England</hi> is the 21. <hi>[To be justified by faith is to be justified by works]</hi> which <hi>I moved to be considered whether it were not near Mr.</hi> Bs. <hi>doctrine Aphorisme</hi> 73. of <hi>Justific.</hi> and in my <hi>Antidote</hi> sect. 8. page 24. said <hi>it is near to it.</hi> Hereupon Mr. <hi>B.</hi> adjudgeth <hi>this dealing so grosse, as he never found in any Jesuite, a shamlesse charge,</hi> and page 190. <hi>the vile ebullition of rancor and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in a most evident falshood, that hath left no roome for blushing.</hi> And then cleares himself from the sense in which the Antinomists held it, and then addes. Now <hi>what doth Mr.</hi> T. <hi>but bring this as the same tenet with mine? when it is even directly contrary.</hi> To which I answer, Mr.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44370:20"/>
                  <hi>B.</hi> page 189. in these words <hi>[Your language about the absolutenesse of the Covenant is too like many of the tenets of the Antinomists in N. E.]</hi> useth the same dealing with me, which he chargeth me with towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. For he doth or might know when I say with many Divines the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is absolute, I meane it as they do in respect of the first promise, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 10. <hi>I will write my lawes in their hearts,</hi> which Doctor <hi>Twisse</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other prove must be absolute or else <hi>the grace of God must be given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mans desert</hi> as the <hi>Pelagians</hi> held, which thing I expresse plainly in my <hi>Examen</hi> page 164. whereas the Antinomians make it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in respect of justification, in which I am assured that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> knew by conferences with me that I was against them, and yet he chargeth me with symbolizing with them. But recrimination is no purgation. 2. It is not true that <hi>I bring it as the same tenet with Mr.</hi> Bs. <hi>but neare it:</hi> which is so true, that however their in tent and his were contrary, yet their words are the same. For Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Aph. 76. and in the <hi>first edition of the Saints everlasting rest</hi> page 11. saith, <hi>Doubtlesse the Gospel takes faith for obedience to all Gospel-precepts, of which the workes,</hi> James 2. 16. <hi>of giving food or clothing to a brother are a part:</hi> which if true, he that is justified by faith is justified by works, and so Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> proposition is the same with the Antinominians, however he used it to a contrary end: it's the same <hi>medium</hi> though Mr. <hi>B.</hi> prove one conclusion by it, and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians another, and I think is condemned by the censure of them of <hi>N. E.</hi> in Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> sense as well as the Antinomians. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> goes about to clear himself from <hi>error</hi> in it and <hi>singularly,</hi> and then saith, <hi>How can Mr.</hi> T. <hi>have ground to think that no Minister in England is of my judgement?</hi> and then <hi>challengeth me to confute the doctrine of his book, or leaves to judge whether I be not a meere empty calumniator.</hi> And addes, that <hi>these words of mine [I am sure in his letter to me, he saith he was hissed at from all parts of the Kingdome] are a relation like the rest from a bitter roote so most falsely, when I had his letters, which might have directed me to speak truth, that the words [from all parts of the Kingdome] are my addition, which is become ordinary with me.</hi> Then mentions <hi>the occasion of the passage in his letters, my offer of help to him for dividing ends, but he thought he had no need of my help, and was resolved not to engage with a renter of the Church.</hi> To which I answer, 1. My exceptions against his doctrine in his <hi>Aphorismes</hi> have been sent to him afore his death, though not to answer his challenge, yet at the motion of his <hi>Postscript.</hi> I conceive he erres, 1. in making justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44370:21"/>
by faith to be onely in law title. 2. In making a first and after continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed justification. 3. In making it, a continued, not instantaneous act. 4. In making obedience to all Gospel-precepts an essentiall part of justifying faith, and not a fruite onely. 2. I did no where say that <hi>I thought no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in</hi> England <hi>is of his judgement,</hi> though I said <hi>I thought he had not made one Minister of his judgement.</hi> 3. to the crimination of my speaking falsely I will set down his own-words in his letter to me, <hi>[That pamphlet of justification I well knew was likely to blast my reputation with most Divines, and the issue hath answered my expectation: I am now so hissed at by them, that I feele temptation enough to schisme in my discontents].</hi> I had hot his letter by me when I spake those words not out of a bitter roote but to answer the prejudice against me as conceived singular. But there was no falshood in my speech <hi>[by most Divines]</hi> and <hi>[from all parts of the Kingdome]</hi> being equipollent. And if this be to adde false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our Lord Christ will be found to adde falsely <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 8, 9. &amp;c. my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of helpe to him in what we agreed was not <hi>for dividing ends,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his complaint of weaknesse of body and want of time for study. It seemes he accounted me a <hi>renter of the Church</hi> afore my preaching at <hi>Bewdley</hi> the many Sermons on <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. against Infant-baptisme, for discovering of the error of it in my bookes without other practises. It appeares thereby that even then when he seemed to be most friendly he had hard thoughts of me, and however he protest of his love, yet his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreting so many of the things I have done or said to him, and at last casting up his accusations in his book in charging me with frequent <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths, schisme, pride, worse then the Devil in accusing my own children,</hi> with bitter scoffes, and insulting tauntes, with other aggravations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions beyond brotherly and neighbourly respects, yea I may I think say, a sober minde are undeniable evidences of want of love to me, and candour towards me, if we may judge what is in a man by his deedes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then by his words. As for his pretence of <hi>zeale for God, the peace of the Church, and the duty of brotherly reproof,</hi> were he never so much in the right, and I never so much in the wrong for my judgement, yet these could not justifie his carriage to me. And if other Ministers deale with me as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Mr. <hi>Baillee,</hi> Mr. <hi>Geree</hi> have done without doing me right after their false criminations of me, I shall have temptation to think that they have learned a principle like the Jesuites, to think it no sin to say as bad as may be against a supposed Anabaptist for the Paedobaptists cause.</p>

               <p>I Have now gone through Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> Epistles and History, vindicated my self and the truth from many objections. There are many other things which are scattered in his answer to my <hi>Valedictory Oration</hi> and <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> of my <hi>Antidote</hi> which are somewhat besides the dispute it self, which I shall rather point at then insist on because many are scarce worth the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of, but for the esteem Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and his book have gotten with men. Page 165. what he speaks of <hi>my exceeding high and passionate dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> was but his misdeeming likely upon misinformation, neither my words nor carriage shewed it. Page 166. what the <hi>supposed girds</hi> were is set down before out of his now printed book, whereby it seems my <hi>few disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> (as he miscalls them) are at least excused, and no notorious falshood chargeable on them: That which he saith, <hi>I forced him to the disputation</hi> I conceive is not right; how it came to passe is shewed above; that there were <hi>thousands of people there</hi> I think is overlasting: the tale of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute is made to prepossesse men with prejudice. I told him before that such a dispute was not fit to satisfy, and I gave him my reasons, and I propounded the way used at the Conference at the <hi>Hague,</hi> judged best by Dr. <hi>Raynolds:</hi> but the way Mr. <hi>B.</hi> took he liked best, and his carriage of it looks like an artifice cunningly contrived to please the common sort of Schollers and others of which few can discerne between sleight and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid proofs. But I doubt not my answer will prove Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> arguments to be meer trifles. The <hi>untruths</hi> charged on me page 167. are upon his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the words written before him. I said not <hi>[to be used by Mr.</hi> B.] but by others mentioned next before. That his passage was <hi>like to be the beginning of a schism among those of</hi> Bewdley was no jest, but a conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture which the event hath proved true: how he misrepresents my words of <hi>charging their blood on them, and hypocrisy to them</hi> is before shewed: it's not true <hi>I had been long time working a fearful schisme,</hi> unlesse by accident, it being true which Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> and Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> say <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement to the Reader,</hi> pag. 27. <hi>scarce truth or error can now adaies be received but in a way of schisme.</hi> His lines were <hi>likely to be the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44370:22"/>
of a schisme,</hi> in that it was taken as if Anabaptists and with them my self were adjudged hereticks by him: which if it were an untruth, yet it is so like a truth, that I think he that shall read in one period what Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sayes of Hereticks, <hi>that they end in wicked lives,</hi> and in the next find the instance in Anabaptists, and after me named as one of them will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he called them and me hereticks. And however he protest he doth not, yet his asserting me a <hi>Sect-Master</hi> page 188. and his inclining to <hi>Vossius,</hi> &amp;c. their definition of an Heretick page 171. and his words page 259. make me think he comes not much short of counting me an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick. To his allegations of my speeches concerning Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents I have answered before. I may say the doctrine was one of the first heresies, yet not censure the men that hold it as heretical; it's one thing to be formally an heretick, and another thing materially, to hold that which denominated a party heretical. In my <hi>Examen</hi> I tell Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and now Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that I think none of those glorious lights mentioned held Mr. <hi>Ms.</hi> position. I do not <hi>judge all hereticks that be against my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but that they may be more justly stiled heretiques then my self. Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> quicknesse in replying afore he weighed my speeches or perhaps my scantnesse in expressions out of warinesse what I said to him (whom I found very captious) hath I perceive created me these hard censures. That which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saies page 172. <hi>he dare say of me</hi> I dare say is false. The inference which he calls <hi>strange</hi> is none of mine: the passage and time of writing it do still prevaile with me to conceive that he wanted a spirit of love through ill surmises of me. Page 174. Infant-sprinking or pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water on them will not be proved baptisme. I shall not <hi>ease sinners that own their infant-sprinkling as baptism by my assertion:</hi> that <hi>I tell them they never sinned against their baptisme and engagement</hi> is a fiction of <hi>Mr. B.</hi> in which he hath a pretty art. I said not <hi>Mr. B.</hi> gave us a title to make us odious, but <hi>[that might make us odious]</hi> which imports the term might make us odious, not that <hi>Mr. B.</hi> had that purpose in using it. Page 175. He hath a discourse <hi>from the end of the accuser and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of justification to accusation and condemnation</hi> to prove, <hi>That it is proper language to say he accuseth another, who denies a supposed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to be due to him.</hi> By the same reason the accusers accusation may be said to be condemnation, and execution too, for that is the end of the accuser. I had thought <hi>[accusation]</hi> noted the accusers act, not his end; that justification is opposed to accusation and condemnation shewes they are distinguished, the one being the charging with a fault, the other passing sentence. I must confesse I yet understand not his language of accusing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44370:22"/>
without charging with a fault, nor do I think any law-dictionary doth so define accusation. I do not think the non-visible churchmembership of infants is poenal, or deprivation of a mercy now, it being only by the alteration of the Church-frame. Whether the not acknowledging infants visible churchmembership be a <hi>denying a mercy reall</hi> or imaginary, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be <hi>injustice, scorne,</hi> or any error in my tenet about it, is to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in answering his book. What I do hold I do it not <hi>without natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection to my children,</hi> out of conscience of maintaining truth. The very same he chargeth upon me for denying infant-baptisme might <hi>mutatis mutandis</hi> by the same reason be charged on him for denying infant-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. I do judge this Rhetorical or Satyrical passage of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to be a meer trifling in a serious matter. That which is said page 176. of <hi>my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting my children out of the Church by denying them to be visible Church-members</hi> is Mr. <hi>Bs</hi> mistake in <hi>defining visible Church-membership</hi> as I shall shew in examining the 27. chap. of the first part of his book. It's not true I deny all <hi>infants to be in Covenant with the Lord their God, or that title to salvation which upon promise they have in point of law.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> conditional Covenant gives no title till the condition be put, which he will not say is true of any infants but the elect, who alone are children of the promise in the Apostles language, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 8. pag. 177. he saith, <hi>I do all I can to keep infants out of the visible Church,</hi> but I deny that to hinder their baptisme is to keep them out of the visible Church, or that to baptize them is to bring them in. If it be, why have they not the communion according to that which we reade, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13? Are Janizaries who were baptized children of Greek Christians therefore visible members of the Christian Church? Mr. <hi>B.</hi> though he had the Copy of my Sermon, yet misrepresents my words. I said not, <hi>that it is the Devils part to say that the infants of believers are members of the visible Church,</hi> but my words were <hi>[it being an error, and such pernicious effects following, that people think therefore they are Christians because baptized,</hi> (which opinion of theirs is confirmed by Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> words. <hi>For they are visible Christians that are baptized into the name of Christ, if they have not since by word or workes renounced him) and rest therein, and are thereby held in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal presumption, we ought rather to think those that maintain infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme play the Devils part]</hi> which expressions of mine being added, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> arguings will appear. That which he hath page 178. <hi>[that it is no more thankes to me then to Satan, that I keep not God from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king promise to his people]</hi> which intimates I would do it if it were in my power (for if there be no more thanks to me then Satan, it is because
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44370:23"/>
there's no more hindrance in me from doing it then in Satan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and so the same will) is a suggestion that exceedes all moderation, as if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> were bent not onely to rake up all the dirt he can to cast in my face, but also to put an ill construction on all I say. My answer was a faire answer to a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent charge. In 2. senses I conceived it might be said that <hi>Infants are disputed out of the Covenant of Christ:</hi> the one as if my dispute made Christ not Covenant to them, the other as if it made them not Covenant to Christ. I said, neither was true. What saies Mr. <hi>B.?</hi> 1. <hi>Election is not a Covenant.</hi> Nor did I say it was. And then addes <hi>[nor are they in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant because elected]</hi> which speech is most false, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 8. where <hi>[the children of the promise]</hi> is all one with <hi>[the Elect]</hi> as the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysis</hi> shewes, as may be seene in the Authors cited by me in my <hi>Examen</hi> part. 3. sect. 4. Besides whom more may be produced. I will add two now. Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> in that piece of his which is the exactest of his workes. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercit. Apol.</hi> 2. c. 2. <hi>num.</hi> 7. <hi>Soli electi dicuntur in Scripturis foederati, filii &amp; haeredes promissionis,</hi> Rom. 9. 8. The elect alone are said in the Sctiptures to be in Covenant, children, and heires of the promise, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 8. and Mr. <hi>Norton in resp. ad Apollon.</hi> c. 2. pag. 30. <hi>Objectum foederis gratiae sunt soli electi.</hi> The object of the Covenant of Grace are the elect alone. Next he saith, that I deny <hi>that God Covenanteth with our infants to be their God in Christ, and to take them to be his peculiar people, which is the Covenant he formerly made with infants, and which he now affirmes.</hi> What he affirmes distinctly I cannot well tell: he doth so confusedly expresse himself in his bookes. He distinguished between an absolute and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Covenant of Grace. The absolute he saies belongs onely to the elect, but this he will not be thought to meane when he speakes of infants of believers being in Covenant, or baptism's sealing of it: yea he blames me often for so conceiving of him, and page 223. he disputes against that tenet as my fifth error. The conditional is a Covenant of justification and salvation upon-condition of faith: this he saith is sealed by baptisme, not the other, and this he makes belonging to all the posterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> elect and reprobate. And this it seemes most likely he meanes, when he speaks of infants of believers being in Covenant, because it is that which baptisme seales, and they that are in Covenant are to be sealed thereby. But according to this conditional Covenaat either all are in Covenant with God whether elect or reprobate, infants of believers or unbelievers, or else <hi>none till they performe the condition,</hi> which is faith, and so not all infants of believers. [Mr. <hi>B. in his additions</hi> to the <hi>Saints everlasting rest,</hi> part. 3. sect. 3. prop. 2. <hi>A conditional promise puts nothing in being, till the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44370:23"/>
performance of the condition; nor gives any certainty, but of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.]</hi> As for any Covenant of God or Christ besides these containing onely the promise of visible Church-membership, or such like imagined priviledges in the New Testament to infants of Gentile believers I take to be a phantasme, and when I come to examine Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> opinion of infants visible Church-membership (which I could not do till I had his book) I doubt not to make it appear to be so, that not one text he hath brought proves such a promise, and that he hath not proved more to belong to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants by promise then I acknowledge, and yet neither visible Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membership, nor right to baptisme in infancy ordinarily will follow thereon. As for that he saith in general termes, that I deny <hi>that God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanteth with infants of believers to be their God in Christ, and to take them to be his peculiar people,</hi> is said like a Calumniator, my words being so plaine to the contrary in that very place. In a word, I have said that the Covenant or promise of regeneration, sanctification, forgivenesse of sins, adoption, and eternal life is not made to all the natural children of the most godly believers, no not of <hi>Abraham</hi> himself, or to any bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because they are their children, but because elect, or believers in their own persons, which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Geree</hi> in their answers to me confesse to be true, as being expresly delivered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 8. and by the streame of Protestant writers maintained. But I deny not that many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of believers are in the Covenant of Grace: nor dare I say that no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of unbelievers are in the Covenant of Christ in this sense: I onely say I neither know which of the one or the other are thus in the Covenant of Grace. As for the arguings that he <hi>that denies Infants baptisme doth deny them to be in the Covenant of Grace,</hi> they are built on these fancies that to <hi>be a seale of the Covenant of Grace is of the essence of baptisme, that there is a certain connexion between being in the Covenant of Grace and right to be baptized:</hi> which with other <hi>hypotheses</hi> of Paedobaptists I shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine in my <hi>Review.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> addes, That <hi>I flatly deny infants Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God,</hi> whereas my words were farre from such flat denial being onely these <hi>[for my part I know not how any person should Covenant with Christ till he promise,</hi> &amp;c.] which were not such a peremptory or flat denial as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saies they are, and they are true, it being against all experience, that infants do so Covenant: but on the contrary when they are baptized cry and shew their unwillingnesse, as <hi>August.</hi> lib. 1. <hi>de remiss. et mer.</hi> pecc. c. 23. <hi>flendo et vagiendo cùm in eis mysterium celebratur ipsis mysteriis vocibus obstrepunt.</hi> Then Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saies, <hi>I disswade parents from so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging their children in Covenant, and promising in their names, which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44370:24"/>
yet they ever did in the Church before Christ, and it was their duty to do, as Deut.</hi> 29. and other places shew. But in which words I perswade parents not to do (as he saies I do) he doth not shew, my words are there all assertory of what I conceive infants cannot do in their own persons, not a word of perswasion or disswasion to the parents or any other. And for that which is added <hi>[then it seemes you know not how a Father should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his child by covenanting in his name]</hi> and after <hi>[you would have no parents to engage their children solemnly to God in Christ by Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their names]</hi> there is not a word of it in that place. 'Tis true in my <hi>Sermon</hi> intituled <hi>Fermentum Pharisaeorum,</hi> I gave a little touch against the use of sureties at baptisme according to the Doctrine of the catechisme in the common prayer-book, that they did <hi>promise that they should believe,</hi> &amp;c. which I conceived onely belongs to Christ as <hi>surety of the better Covenant, Heb.</hi> 7. 22. But I never denied, that the Elders of a Nation may engage solemnly the posterity even the unborne to take the Lord for their God (but this I rather take to be an adjuration under a curse if they do not, then a promise for them that they shall) nor that a parent may engage his child by a promise of his own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that he shall; and that the child is engaged thereby: but not by vertue of the Fathers promise, but by vertue of the obligation of the thing promised, the Fathers promise is an incitement to do it the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but makes not the child bound to do it of it self, but onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the thing is a duty, which he were bound to did the Father promise for him or not. But I deny, that this makes a visible Church-member, or that in nature or law as his childs act according to the Gospel for his being admitted a visible Church-member. Now Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hastily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering me jumbles things together, and as one impatient of considering what I say, chargeth me with what I avow not, and then concludes scoffical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>And I pray you how well do you free your self from this charge?</hi> Should I imitate him I should cry <hi>shamelesse foul dealing,</hi> &amp;c. But I am resolved to examine his writing, not to follow his fashion Pag. 179. He saies, <hi>I did not distinguish of disciples, or yield infants disciples in any sense,</hi> &amp; <hi>If I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them disciples in any sense, I should speak out.</hi> To which I say, I put in those words in my Sermon <hi>in that sense, Christ appointed disciples to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> to intimate that I did not deny, but infants might be disciples by the immediate secret work of Gods spirit, though not in the ordinary &amp; mediate way of preaching the Gospel, about which the rule <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. is set. As for Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> sense of a <hi>disciple of Christ without learning Christs do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of a servant of God without service actively or passively, a disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44370:24"/>
remotely by the Fathers being a disciple</hi> it is nothing like the use of the word [disciple] in the New Testament or the terme <hi>[servant of God]</hi> as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipollent to <hi>[a disciple]</hi> and no marvel I should mistake Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who used termes in a sense I never met with in the New Testament, and I still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be a piece of new gibberish. And when he saith, <hi>he took servant, and disciple according to their relative formal nature, and not either with the accidental consideration of active or passive,</hi> it is no marvel I should be at a stand what to answer him using termes in such an uncouth non-sense acception as I never met with before. <hi>(For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to battel?)</hi> And it seemes to me a grosser absurdity which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath in those words, then any of those he chargeth me with, to take disciple and servant in their relative formal nature without learning or service active or passive; whereas Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himselfe page 92. where he saies, <hi>the relation of a servant, disciple, souldier, husbandman, trades-man remaines when the act ceaseth for a time,</hi> yet expressely saith, <hi>the relation and so the denomination is from the act of service, learning,</hi> &amp;c. and yet he would have infants to be denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated disciples and servants of God without their act of learning or service, or capacity of actual learning or service in an ordinary way: and he is not ashamed to call learning or service actively or passively <hi>accidental to the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or denomination of a disciple or servant.</hi> Which is a monstrous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity to make a denomination without the forme denominating, yea to count it accidental to conceive a relation without the foundation, which is all one as to call one a Father without begetting, a Lord without domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, a signe without signification, not unlike the riddle <hi>vir non vir, percussit non percussit, avem non avem, lapide non lapide, super arbore non arbore,</hi> or rather <hi>absurdorum absurdissimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oppositum in apposito.</hi> And yet this notion of a disciple never proved is the ground work of Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> first. argument, and therefore if I may use Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> words, <hi>they are very tractable soules that are led by his notions.</hi> page 180. He thinks <hi>strange that a man of my parts should know of no separation to God but by election or calling, he questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whether election be proper separation,</hi> he saies <hi>that the Jewes first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne were seperated by a law, and men now by dedication separate goods to God, that he meanes separation neither by election nor extraordinary or ordinary call, but by the law or Covenant of God.</hi> To which I reply, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> still abuseth me by leaving out my words <hi>[as the case now stands]</hi> which were put in as remarkable, to exclude that way of separation to God, whereby the first born, Priests, goods, &amp;c. were holy as separated to God. Election is, alwayes with seperation, that is, differencing one from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44370:25"/>
another, and as election is said to be <hi>according to purpose,</hi> Rom. 9. 11. so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise separation, <hi>Paul</hi> was separated <hi>from his mothers wombe,</hi> Gal. 1. 15. according to Gods pleasure and purpose, that is by his election: And with this separation infants may be said to be sanctified, as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ch. 1. 5.

As for infants of believers whether elect or reprobate outward federal holinesse I know no such, there's no law or Covenant se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates every child of a believer to God.

A law or Covenant of God se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating all infants of believers barely for their parents faith to be visible members of the Christian Church is Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> dream, as I shall shew with Gods assistance in examing his second argument.</p>

of men that are infants the <hi>species;</hi> yet other Logicians usually call [man] the lowest <hi>species</hi> or kind, and say, <hi>age and sex make not another kinde.</hi> 2. But allowing Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> their language, I say, <hi>the dispute is not about the</hi> species <hi>or kind, to wit, infants as infants,</hi> but infants of believers, who are particular persons, and the question as it was rightly stated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> was, <hi>Whether the infants of believers were to be baptized with Christs baptisme by a lawfull Minister according to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rule without extraordinary revelation or direction?</hi> And if Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobaptists will maintain their practise, they should make good this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, <hi>That all the infant-children of professed or inchurched believers are to be baptized with Christs baptisme by the law full Minister ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ordinary rule.</hi> Though Mr. <hi>Baillee</hi> and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> for some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage set down this as their proposition to be proved, That <hi>some infants are to be baptized.</hi> M. <hi>B.</hi> saies <hi>he had proved our priviledges greater then the Jewes, and that I deny it not, and that this</hi> (to wit, to be Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants) <hi>was not peculiar to them.</hi> Whereas I had proved the contrary from ver. 55. and the whole chapter is about lawes peculiar to the Jews, and ver. 38, 39, 40. going before, shew plainly that this law was peculiar to the Jewes, that they and their children should return from servitude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they were for poverty, at the year of Jubilee, and ver. 45, 46. plainly restraines it to the children of Israel, allowing them to take the children of strangers so journing among them, and therefore proselytes, as an inheritance. And therefore in whatever sense it is meant that they are Gods servants, it is meant onely of <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 2. is expressed. I do not conceive, nor any interpreters that I meete with do expound this of a proselyte, but onely of an <hi>Hebrew</hi> borne. If <hi>Cornelius</hi> had children they had not been Gods servants in the sense there meant: which is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that they were his servants in this respect only in that place, in that they were to be disposed of not as men would, but as he onely would, who had right to them by his purchase in bringing them out of Egypt, and therefore <hi>none can get soveraigne Dominion over them</hi> (no not by their voluntary selling themselves) to <hi>prejudice his,</hi> as <hi>Deodat. annot.</hi> in <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 42. Whence I infer, that it is a most grosse abuse of this Scripture in Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to urge it to prove that the infants of Gentile believers now are servants to God, related to him as a peculiar people, separated to himself from the world: which is spoken meerly in respect of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> children, and their corporal servitude, which was to be at Gods disposing by reason of his redemption of them out of Egypt.

As for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion and argument as he sets it down page 182. I think it was not ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the dispute, and I have proved that <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. 42. is meant onely of <hi>Hebrew</hi> children, not of Gentiles, nor in the sense Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would prove that they are relatively separate to God from the world in the sense as [Gods servants]. is equipollent to a disciple of Christ.

believe that it is better that infants are no Christians, then that they were. But believe him that list for me.</hi> To which I say, I will not do as he often deales with me, charging me as <hi>playing the Devils part, and worse,</hi> but this I say, I know not what to conceive of these words, but that either by Gods judicial act of leaving him to himself, out of addicted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to calumniate, or extream ill opinion of me, or which I much feare not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all his protestations out of disdainfulnesse of his Antagonist and delight in Satyrical quips he vented this passage. He cannot shew where ever I used such an impious speech: all I have said is onely this, It is a mercy that our children are not visible Church-members as the Jews were, because it brought a heavy bondage, and the Christian Church-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of voluntiers is better, nor do our children lose any thing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of such visible Church-membership. Yet if I had said so, that I would say so for the time to come who can say but God? Might I not have repented and altered my speech? Then he goes on to answer my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing against his allegation of <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. to prove infants disciples, and calls it <hi>silly grounds, insipid arguing,</hi> according to his usual Rhetorick, whereas the sillinesse (if any) is in his own inconsideratenesse of the strength of it. That text serves not Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> turne unlesse it could be proved, that the very act or action which these false teachers did were the cutting with a knife the little skin of the privy member, for no more was done to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in actual circumcision, nor were they passive subjects of any other action. Now Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> argument is from what was done to infants by false teachers that infants are meant by <hi>[disciples, Act.</hi> 15. 10.] But it is manifest that the false teachers did not cut off that little skin, but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of the infants as Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> text shewes, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 21. and the same text ascribing the contrary to <hi>Paul</hi> to that which the false teachers did, shewes it was teaching that was their putting on the yoke: which is more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 1. where what is said v. 10. <hi>they put the yoke on the necks of the disciples,</hi> is ver. 1. <hi>they taught the brethren:</hi> the disciples then are the brethren, and the putting on the yoke is the teaching them. My argument is this, that the false teachers did no other thing but teach, now the act there is ascribed to the false teachers onely, not to the parents of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, none are blamed but they, they are spoken of and to, not the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; therefore the putting on of the yoke was not actual circumcision, which was the parents act, not the false teachers: they neither did it, nor by any instrument attempt to do it themselves, though the one might follow on the other. And I dare still appeale to any that are of common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, whether that which the false teachers, did <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. were to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44370:27"/>
infants or parents. And for Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> exceptions, To the first, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes my confession, I confessed they did not put the yoke eternally, but onely endeavoured it, because though they taught them the necessity of circumcision, yet their doctrine was not received, but I never said to my remembrance, that the phrase of putting on the yoke noted barely their intent or attempt, but the act they did though <hi>sine effectu</hi> on the disciples: my words are plaine as they are printed, in which it is manifest the putting on of the yoke was by the teaching of the false teachers. As for Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> instances they serve better for me then himself. He that teacheth people to be subject to the <hi>Turk,</hi> though thereby he inslave their infants by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, yet the subject recipient of his act are onely the people taught, nor doth any man in that speech understand the infants; and so it must be said of <hi>Moses</hi> subjecting the children of Israel to his law, though by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent infants were circumcised, yet in this speech <hi>Moses</hi> subjected (by teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or commanding) the children of Israel to his law. The terme [children of Israel] notes onely, or as Logicians speake <hi>supponitly</hi> parents onely. The act of Gods calling Christ out of Egypt is a complex act, noting the sending the Angel; the command to <hi>Joseph,</hi> his carrying Christ, whereof Christ was the object or <hi>terminus,</hi> not onely of the command. But the false Teachers Act. 15. 10. was formally the single act of teaching not circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, they neither acted it nor attempted it in their own persons, and therefore could have no other subject recipient, but those that were taught, not infants. Page 187. He calls my speech <hi>[that I think Mr.</hi> B. <hi>cannot shew in any one place where the word [holy] is taken in his sense for a state or person</hi> (I do conceive I said for the state of a person) <hi>separated to God in that way he would have a person separated to God neither by election nor outward calling, nor any other way that I know of in which holinesse is used for a state separated to God] a new crotchet of the nature of the rest,</hi> and answers it with a quaver, and a jest. His quaver is, <hi>Is it not enough that I prove it alwayes taken for a separation to God, but I must shew that the word signifies a separation by this or that way or meanes effected?</hi> His jest follows, <hi>A man was out of love with his wife, &amp;c. and is not this the same kind of reasoning with yours?</hi> To which I reply, It is not enough. For 1. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sayes, that <hi>holinesse is alwayes taken for a separation to God.</hi> 2. I am sure that it is taken for chastity, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 3, 4. and Mr. <hi>B.</hi> denies it not page 255. onely saies it is a part of sanctity, though ver. 3. <hi>Beza</hi> translates it, <hi>id est, ut abstineatis à fornicatione,</hi> which shewes the holinesse there is no other then chastity, or at least chastity in the first place, which is plain from ver. 4. where it is, <hi>to possesse the vessel,</hi> that is, the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44370:27"/>
body in <hi>holinesse,</hi> that is, chastity, which the opposition <hi>to the lust of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisence,</hi> ver. 5. and <hi>uncleannesse,</hi> ver 7. do shew. And this acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Illyricus in his clavis Script.</hi> on the word <hi>Sanctus, Piscator in his scholie</hi> on 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 4. and others which I shall produce in my <hi>Review.</hi> 3. Then it must needs follow according to Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> position, that to be chaste is to be holy in a state of separation to God. But I suppose Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not say every chaste person is in a state saparated to God which may intitle him to baptisme, therefore it is not enough for Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> purpose to prove a person any way holy or in a state separated to God, that thereby he be intitled to baptisme: but he must shew the way how he is holy, and that this intitles to baptisme.

I further add, that in his general sense <hi>[Legitimate]</hi> might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so signifie a state separate to God, as being that onely posterity he allowes of according to his institution of marriage, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. which is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called <hi>holy</hi> by Divines. And therefore letting passe his jocular tale, my exception or answer to his reasoning from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. deserves a better refutation then he hath yet given. Then he makes me say, that no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture speakes of holinesse in his sense, whereas my words (as above) were more wary, Mr. <hi>B. I think cannot shew, &amp;c.</hi> And then tells me, that the <hi>Jewes infants are called the Holy seed, and that by covenant or law, which is his sense, and then chargeth me with laying by conscience and common modesty, having little tendernesse of conscience in accusing his will in charging him with a grosse falshood, that he was willing to carry things in generals, and not to tell distinctly how infants are holy and in a state separated to God, whereas he told me he meant holy by law or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</hi> Notwithstanding which I may yet conceive him willing to carry things in generals, sith this very explication is in generals, the law or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, as he calls it, being not distinctly named and shewed where it is, and upon what conditions that state of separation to God which infants have is ascertained, whether upon their own act or parents, and if upon parents whether immediate or mediate, whether to the truth and reality or profession, nor wherein that state of separation to God consists, or what is the benefit of it: all or of some which perhaps I apprehend Mr. <hi>B.</hi> rightly in now, yet not till I had read over his book again and again, and pickt out his meaning by comparing many passages together: which because
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44370:28"/>
he did not then, nor since in his printed writings put together as others do in their <hi>theses</hi> they maintaine. I guessed he was willing to carry things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the general, and if I did say so (which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and I must take on his Scribes word) in my Sermon without any caution, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> might have imagined that I meant it with this caution (which is ordinarily allowed in constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of such speeches, where thematter leades us to conceive them intended) that I conceived him unwilling: which might be the more allowed to me in that speech which I had not a word written when I spake it; which of all other Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is least fit to except against me for, having in print offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this way in worse manner, page 185. But to the matter now we conceive his meaning, I still say the same, that I think he cannot shew one place, where [holy] is taken for separated to God in his sense. He alleadgeth that the <hi>Jewes infants are called the holy seed:</hi> though he name not the text, (which had been fit) yet I guesse by his words page 83. he meanes <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 2. in which place onely and <hi>Isaiah</hi> 6. 13. I find this terme in Scripture. But <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 2. doth not speak of infants, but such <hi>a holy seed as mingled themselves with the people of the land,</hi> which was in marriage, which will not be said of infants; nor is <hi>[holy seed]</hi> there meant of a state sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to God in Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> sense by Covenant promising it to believers, that their infants should be visible Church-members: For this holinesse was a state of difference or separation onely by legal descent from Israel, not by the faith of next parents, and it did intitle them to a peculiar priviledge of being reckoned in the genealogy of Israel, or in full communion with the Common-wealth of Israel in respect of inheritance, marriage, &amp;c. though they fell to Idolatry, as <hi>Jeroboam, Ahaz, Manasseh,</hi> &amp;c. did. But proselytes though believers were not <hi>the holy seed</hi> there meant, they were not forbidden to marry the daughters of the people of the land. Yea the children of the holy seed begotten upon prohibited women, as the daughters of the Nations there mentioned, were with their mothers to be put away as unholy according to the law, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 3. contrary to the reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution af the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 12, 13, 14. which evidently shewes that the Jewes are called <hi>the holy seed</hi> by their descent according to the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and that the term <hi>[holy seed, Ezra</hi> 10. 2.] is all one with <hi>[Legitimate]</hi> and if the Apostle did allude to that place in <hi>Ezra</hi> it serves more for my sense then Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> and the sense may be conceived this, <hi>If the unbelieving husband were not as sanctified to his wife so as that they might lawfully live together, then the children should be unclean, that is illegitimate, as those in</hi> Ezra: <hi>but now, that is it being determined that the law of</hi> Moses <hi>concerning prohibiting marriage with some people is voided, and unequal
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44370:28"/>
marriage is not dissolved, your children are holy that is legitimate.</hi> His evasion page 188. about a judgement of charity will be found insufficient to avoid my exception against his exposition, which is mistaken by him; nor will it at all smite me, my exception being not as he imagines, that upon a judgement of charity concerning the sincerity of a persons profession he is not to be taken for a real believer: But that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> determining <hi>that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer is sanctified onely to the believer, who is not onely such according to the judgement of charity, but also really such before God; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles consequence including this Proposition according to his exposition, that the children of such onely are holy, that is, after Mr.</hi> B. <hi>visible Church-members and baptizable, of necessity all other by his exposition are prohibited to be baptized; and therefore of necessity he that will follow the rule according to Mr.</hi> Bs, <hi>exposition must know the reality of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents faith, which being impossible to be known without special revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he may baptize none without it.</hi> Now Mr. <hi>B.</hi> answers not at all to the main thing, how by his exposition a man can go upon certainty that he doth his duty: but how without respect to his exposition a man may take a person for a sincere believer, and so baptize him. But this serves not his turne in this case. For it is the duty of the baptizer to baptize onely visible Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members: this Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will not deny: now of infants who can make no profession, their visible Church-membership is known onely by their parents believing; but according to Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> exposition of the Apostle, those infants onely are visible Church-members whose parents are real believers before God: no hypocrite if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> rightly expound the Apostle can make his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant a visible Church-member, and baptizable, for his children are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane. But it is not possible for a baptizer to know the parent to be a real believer before God without special revelation, and therefore without it he cannot be certain he doth his duty according to Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> suppositions; yea he may be certain he doth not his duty: For he may be certain he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not observe the rule of baptizing onely the infants of those that are real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers before God, it being certain some in the visible Church are hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and he is not to baptize the infants of such, if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> rightly expound the Apostle, they being unclean, that is, no visible Church-members, nor baptizable, and therefore he may be certain in baptizing promiscuously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of visible professors that he doth not his duty, if Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> exposition be good, but sins against the Apostles determination, in baptizing those that are not baptizable by the Apostles determination as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> expounds him, and if he be intelligent against his own light: but cannot be certain he doth his duty, because he cannot know which are baptizable, those infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44370:29"/>
onely baptizable according to the Apostles resolution as expounded by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> who are the children of believers not onely so accounted in the judgement of charity, but also really such before God, which he cannot know without special revelation.</p>

upon such mistaken grounds, 1.

His extreame bitternesse or uncharitablenesse towards me and those he termes Sectaries. 2.

He changeth [them] into [it] and so leaves it doubful what he meanes that I compare with the falling of the house: But I imagine he meanes the monstrous births, because he addes that the <hi>falling of the house might easily come from a natural cause.</hi> But the truth is, I did not make any comparison between the one and the other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as if the one were no more observable then the other, but onely gave an instance to prove, that it is not safe to determine of a doctrine whether pleasing God by an accident: sith that accident in appearance to them was as evident a providence of God as could be, that while they were debating the matter it should then fall on one side where married Priests were, and not on the other side, where were Monkes. And in respect of the time it was in shew a more likely evidence of Gods disproving marriage of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, then the monsters in <hi>New England</hi> of disproving Mr. <hi>Wheelwrights</hi> doctrine, they not happening at the time of his preaching, or the <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi> sitting at <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New England, August</hi> 30. 1637. or the Courts proceeding against them, <hi>Oct.</hi> 2. 1637. but at another time and place though near them, and not in so open a manner to publique view as that was, though after evidenced sufficiently at the taking up of Mrs. <hi>Dyers</hi> child. And though the fall of a roome might come from a natural cause, yet it falling at such a time on one part, and not on another, I believe if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had been then present he would have been apt to take it as an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary providence of God against married Priests, as Doctor <hi>Gouge</hi> in his priented Sermon, and many others did the fall of the house at <hi>Blackfriers on Drury, Redyate</hi> Popish Priests, &amp;c. <hi>Oct.</hi> 26. 1623. against the Papists. 3. <hi>That I disswade from judging of doctrine by such accidents.</hi> To which I answer, My words are plain, I conceive no safety of judging what doctrine is true or fals, but by going to the law and testimony, and trying thereby, and therefore bid men take heed how they follow Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his direction, and of so adhering to the voice of God in monsters or other providences as bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon them to judge a doctrine to be false. And this I still think good advice, 1. Because the Scripture is the sufficient and onely rule which now we have to judge doctrines by whether they be true or false 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. 2. It is the command of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the doing of a signe or wonder, yet to look to the doctrine of a prophet.

The like is <hi>Isai.</hi> 9. 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 29, 31. yea <hi>John</hi> 5. 39. Christ referres them to the Scriptures notwithstanding his miracles. 3. Because though true mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are never to be distrusted, yet Christ hath foretold us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24. There shall arise false Christs and fals Prophets, and shall shew great signes and wonders, insomuch that (if it were possible) they shall deceive the very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, and the like is foretold, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 9, 10. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13. 13, 14. 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause true miracles themselves do not testifie immediately concerning the doctrine, but the person that he is sent of God, and consequently of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>John</hi> 3. 2. and then they are wrought by the person himself. As for other providences or real wonders if not wrought by the person, but on him, though they should be dreaded and observed as Gods workes, and when we have examined the doctrine by Scripture they have great influence on us either to confirme or unsettle in an opinion, yet they are rather discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Gods judgements of men and their practises, then their opinions; and yet therein we may mistake thinking Gods judgement may be against one when it is against another, and thinking them worse then others contrary to our Saviours doctrine, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And in the relation of such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents there is not alwayes that certainty that may settle a person as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the mistakes of many, and many such are invented and related with much art and confidence so as to deceive credulous people frequently. In a word, I conceive Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself saith in effect as much as I say, <hi>I know wonders that are not miracles are not to be interpreted or trusted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word, for Satan by Gods permission may performe them, and Antichrist may do lying wonders.</hi> 4. He excepts against me that <hi>I say, God would rather have us judge that they are stumbling blocks, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should not receive the truth,</hi> and most of his invectives are against this Answ. Nothing is so well said but may be depraved when a mans words are misinterpreted. My words are, We may think we ought to determine, that God may order accidents so, as to become stumbling blocks, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple should not receive the truth rather then by any accidents to determine a truth to be an untruth. Which are different from that which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sets down as my words, 1. He recites my wordes thus [they are] as if they spake of the accidents next mentioned, whereas my words are [God may order accidents so] which note onely accidents possible. 2. Whereas my words were comparatively spoken to this purpose, that accidents are so far from being a rule to determine of truth, that God sometimes orders them to become stumbling blocks, which is the same with that of <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>The Lord your God proveth by signes and wonders of the false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to know whether you will keep his coommandments.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> recites
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44370:32"/>
them thus <hi>[We are to judge they are</hi> (meaning such accidents) <hi>stumbling blocks that people should not receive the truth]</hi> as if I had spoken posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively of those particular accidents forementioned, that God did order them to that end, whereas I onely to give reason of my advise of warinesse set down my observation comparatively, and spake of accidents that might be not of what were. Which being thus stated, Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> exceptions are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and shew either his inconsideratenesse in what he saies, or proneness to misconstrue what I speak. That which he puts in by the way of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concerning the sin against the Holy Ghost, <hi>as if it did lie much in an infidelity against the convincing testimony of miracles, and of the not believing true miracles, and of Gods ordering some wonders, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents in</hi> New England, may be allowed him, yet makes nothing to prove that remarkable providences of God are a safe rule by which to judge what doctrine is true, and which is false. As for his words of me <hi>[that it seemes if I had seen the wonders of Egypt, I would not onely have been hardened as</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>but judged God laid them as stumbling blocks]</hi> I leave others to judge what spirit they proceed from, and do resolve that though he paint me as an incarnate Devil or worse. I shall take him for a Saint though a very distemper'd one. Page 198. the Scribe hath written in my words [or none of them] in stead of [or to them onely.]</p>

Then he askes me, <hi>But what real Horeticks can Mr.</hi> T. <hi>name that had holy lives?</hi> It is hard to answer his question, because of the difficulty to determine who is a real Heretique, some onely making him an heretique that holds an error against the foundation, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers any error against the doctrine of Christ, some make it necessary that it be held with pertinacy, some with a party, some against self-convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> speeches shew he is not fully resolved. Nor is it easie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine who erres, nor what degree of holinesse is necessary to a holy life, or how it may be known.

But however (saith Mr. <hi>B.) the best have made nothing to sacrifice the unity and peace of the Church to their fancy, and rent it in pieces to strengthen their party:</hi> whence Mr. <hi>B.</hi> seems to infer they had not holy lives, but were wicked. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, if any man of purpose do so, I cannot think him to live holily; I know <hi>the wisdome from above is peaceable,</hi> Jam. 3. 17. Yet holy men thinking their fancy to be Gods truth, may out of zeal to their opinion rend the Church, and yet be holy men. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith in his <hi>Epist.

In charging them with the evils of sundry who were never of their society. 2. In charging the evils of some few Apostates upon all the Churches, though they expressely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the persons, and declared even publiquely in print against their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principles and practises, yea have been the first and almost the onely
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44370:33"/>
men who have so declared, though many more then ever were of their Churches have fallen into the wicked Ranting wayes besides <hi>Copp,</hi> and some others termed Anabaptists.

To which I say, Who are carried to one side or other in judgement and conscience, it's impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to determine, and therefore such an estimation as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> propoundes is not feasible: it's known many have been wicked on both sides: <hi>Copps</hi> and his followers madnesse is disclaimed by the Churches in <hi>London</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der baptisme in their <hi>Heart-bleedings for professors abominations,</hi> and therefore by <hi>Austins</hi> rule should not be charged on the Churches. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hacket</hi> or any other were as wicked, who knowes but God? The evil carriages of the men have risen from their opinion of high enjoyments of God in the spirit, when they left ordinances, as was observed in the <hi>Levellers,</hi> not while they kept to baptisme and Church-communion. Mr. <hi>Weld</hi> observed in his <hi>Story of the Antinomians</hi> page 40. <hi>that conceit of special revelations was the original of Mrs.</hi> Hutchinsons <hi>miscarriage,</hi> and the like is conceived of the Anabaptists in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the like tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy was neare acting in <hi>New England</hi> as there. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I still judge does ill to aggravate so farre the actions of those in <hi>Germany</hi> and some in <hi>England,</hi> as if no miscarriages of others were comparable. I am sure it is no rule to judge a doctrine false by this, that the professors miscarry, but only to make men wary and fearful. If it be, he must judge the same doctrine false by reason of some mens miscarriages, and true because of others god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly living. Page 200. <hi>he excepts against my Logick, for saying it is not</hi> idem per idem <hi>to know a false Prophet by his false doctrine. For what is a false Prophet but one that preacheth false doctrine?</hi> I answer, A false Prophet is one that is not sent by God, as a false Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 13. is one that is not an Apostle of Christ, and it is no trifling repetition of the same, but the sure note that Christ gives, to say a false Prophet is known by his false doctrine. <hi>Ball</hi> Trial of grounds for separation chap. 13. page 312. If we look into the Scriptures of the old and New Testament, we shall never find the Prophets called true or false in respect of their outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but in respect of their doctrine. When Mr. <hi>B.</hi> interprets [likely] by [ordinarily, or for the most part, or usually] as our ordinary sense of that phrase, I think he mistakes in the meaning and use of the word, and that [probably] doth better answer to it then [usually.] However, sith he dare not say that constantly all false doctrines end in wicked lives, Christs dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

as he makes it <hi>[to know false Prophets by their wicked lives, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily though not constantly they end in however they begin otherwise]</hi> is a very blind one for his people of <hi>Kederminster</hi> to make use of, sith they cannot by it discerne an Antinomian or Anabaptist to be a false Prophet to beware of them, till they have observed the end of a whole party proving wicked, which perhaps will not be till they are dead that are tempted by them.</p>

               <p>PAge 201. To deterre his hearers from Anabaptistry Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had said, <hi>Where hath there been known a society of Anabaptists since the world first knew that proved not wicked?</hi> A direct answer to this question thus propounded can hardly be made, nor is it necessary. It can hardly be made, it being a question that depends partly upon much reading of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories in former times both about the doctrine and manners of men compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively obscure and contemned. Whereas Historians speak little but of eminent societies, and occurrences that make a remarkable change in the affaires of their time: and of things done in those ages in which Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are but few, and not of the best note, when greatest darknesse was on the Church, and hardest censures of the best: partly upon an exact intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the affaires of the present Churches of so called Anabaptists in many Countreys, who have been so depressed by the opposite party as that it is somewhat hard to learne where they be. All the intelligence I can get of them is by bookes for the most part of them that are their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Besides, it is very difficult to passe a censure upon a society, which is not a consistent but a flowing body, some members coming in, some cast out, some dying, same sound, some rotten, some removing dwellings, subject to change of Ministers, opinions, &amp;c. whether in the end they have proved wicked or not, it being usual that some in such societies do prove wicked, and others prove well. And what man is there that wants not either age to see the beginninig and end of such a society, or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44370:34"/>
to know the state of all or most of such a society, or judiciousnesse to conclude whe her they proved wicked or not, it being certain that men may fall foully and yet die in Christ, and there being no fixed rule for us to judge who dies wicked, who not. The wisest Divines do advise cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in judging the final estate even of selfe-murtherers that have died with horrible speeches in their mouthes not long before their death. I thinke God onely fit to judge of mens final estate, and therefore think him fit onely to resolve Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> question. If I should aske Mr. <hi>B.</hi> where hath there been known a society of Antiprelatists, that have not in the end pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wicked, I think it would be as hard a thing for Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to give answer to it, as for me to give answer to his question. When men speak of men they speak as they are affected, some magnifying whom others debase, some counting that wicked which others count pious, he's canonized as a Saint, a Martyr by some who is judged a Traitor, Malefactor by others. They that passe such a censure must trust much to informations, which whether they be partial or impartial, true or false who can tell? Nor is it necessary to answer Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> question. For to what end? Is it thereby to conclude against me the doctrine they held? But what may be known by the certain rule of Scripture without this uncertain sign. And therefore I conceive of this question not unlike the artifice of the Jesuites to deterre people from the plain doctrine the Protestants hold by calling for Catalogues of Protestants in all ages, demanding where was your Church before <hi>Luther?</hi> As if we must not own a manifest truth we find in Scripture, unlesse we can produce teachers of it in former dayes, and societies of professors of it that were not wicked. Yet I gave for answer some instances of some societies now in <hi>Londor,</hi> 500. years ago in <hi>France,</hi> and some later in <hi>Germany.</hi> As for those now in <hi>London,</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saies, 1. <hi>They are not yet come to the proof; when they have reached to the end of what they are tending to, then it will be seen what they will prove, if they do not return and repent.</hi> Answ. What he meanes by the end of what the societies in <hi>London</hi> under baptisme (I mean) are tending to I know not. If he mean Levelling, or Ranting, or universal grace, they have as much for their number and quality opposed them as any other in <hi>London;</hi> if he know any other dangerous end they aime at, it were fit it should be named, that their designe may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: if not, who can interpret this speech of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> but as from a man out of a settled hatred to the opinion unwilling to hope well of the persons, against the rule of charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. which hopeth all things in them for the future whom he knows not for present to be desperately bad, which he wil not say of the Churches of Anabaptists in <hi>Germany,

Holland, England,</hi> of whom Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his book against Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> page 310. saith thus: <hi>Yea what will you say to all the Churches of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists in</hi> Germany, Holland, England, <hi>&amp;c. Have none of them grace till baptized? Are you sure so many thousands are all unpardoned, or that God is not wont to pardon them and give them grace? I dare not think so uncharitably of them.</hi> And after <hi>Who dare think that it is</hi> (of the Anabaptists) <hi>such an error as excludeth them from grace?</hi> There have been societies of them for a great while, though somewhat latent afore these times, and of them many of the leaders are fallen asleep in the Lord, many remain unblameable in respect of their faith and life. And therefore why Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should so forebode as he doth the wicked end of the societies remaining I know no reason but his ill opinion of them. But should God in his just judgement let it fall out so that they should prove wicked, as some Churches, yea the most famous, as the seven in <hi>Asia</hi> have done, which have begun well and ended ill, it is no certain evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their doctrine, sith their miscarriages may come from other causes, whereof here and <hi>Examen</hi> part. 2. sect. 5. some are assigned by me, and are such as have befallen others as well as they. 2. Saith Mr. <hi>B. It is hard with your cause when you cannot name one society of them that ever lived in the world that proved not wicked, except those now alive whose ends we yet see not.</hi> Answ. 1. It were not hard with our cause though we name no society or person before our selves that were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipaedo baptists as long as we have the Scripture for it. 2. If I could not name one society, yet there may be many, we have but obscure intelligence of many Churches in the East and other places. The Georgians children or the Christians children of <hi>Cholcis</hi> say <hi>Heylin</hi> in his <hi>Geography</hi> in the description of <hi>Armenia,</hi> out of <hi>Brerewood, Alex. Rosse</hi> in his censure of <hi>religio medici, &amp;c. are not baptized till they be eight years old:</hi> How they live, what they be we have no clear intelligence probably ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest though poore Christians. The certain state of them in <hi>London</hi> is not known to many, much lesse the state of those farre off. 3. We have seen the ends of many of the societies to have been blessed: and how otherwise we now alive should see the end of a successive society, I do not well conceive, until is be quite dissolved. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> addes. 3. <hi>If I were never so able to answer this, yet as the world goes it is not safe to speak all or half the wickednesse of the Anabaptists now living, which the history of this age will speak to posterity.</hi> Answ. 1. Why it should not be safe for Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to speak half the wickednesse of the Anabaptists now living, I cannot divine, except it be, because if he or others speak of them while
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44370:35"/>
they live they may be convinced of lying, as <hi>Beza</hi> did the tale of his dying a Papist. They are not so many, nor so formidable in power, or so spiteful in spirit that it should be unsafe for Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to tell the worst he knowes of them. However me thinks of any man Mr. <hi>B.</hi> being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his declaration of himself in such expectations of death as neare, and so resolute to speak truth, should not be moved by the unsafenesse of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth. Yea if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should speak all he could, I think he should not more exasperate them then he hath done part. 2. chap. 14. Those that sit at the sterne I cannot yet learne have such hard thoughts of them as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> And he that reades Mr. <hi>Edwards Gangraena,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baillee his Anabaptism,</hi> and other writings, may imagine that if there were worse matters to charge them with, they would not be spared in this age, especially by those that are out of their reach. After-Historians may relate as partially as the present, and therefore I shall not think it lawful to condemne them upon such dark intimations as this, but think the better of them till their wickednesse be laid open. 4. Saith Mr. <hi>B. Yet if you had named that society that are not guilty of schisme and demolishing the Church by division and contempt and reproach of the godly. Ministery and disobedience to those in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, further then they please them, and covenant-breaking, and neglect of the Lords day, &amp;c. you would credit the particular society if you make it good. In the meane time I see them rolling down the hill so fast that I think many have but one step lower to go.</hi> Answ. Schisme was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Protestants by Papists, for their not joining in their corruptions with them, by Prelatists to non-conformists, for not yielding to ceremonies of Bishops. <hi>Covel</hi> in his <hi>preface to his answer to</hi> Burges, <hi>accused the most moderate of them as making a rent in the Church, and breaking from the Bishops</hi> (even in that where in they were very passive) <hi>choosing rather to for sake their function and calling then to yield conformity to the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church.</hi> Allen <hi>and</hi> Shepherd <hi>answer to Mr.</hi> Ball page 27. <hi>Advert. to the Read.</hi> say truly: <hi>Scarce truth or error can now adaies be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived but it is maintained in a way of schism.</hi> I confesse it is too true, that it is hard to name any society of Anabaptists or Infant-baptists that are not in a schisme, and commonly both parties guilty of making the breach. I am conscious to my selfe of using what meanes I could for reformation without schisme, if possible: but I find (it as mens spirits are) impossible: yet Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is not ashamed to tell the world in print, that he hath as good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that I am a Sect-Master, as that I am a Christian. I made to Mr. <hi>M.</hi> in the <hi>Epilogue</hi> of my <hi>Examen</hi> as faire notions as I could devise, yea such as a holy sweet-spirited man and understanding did much rejoice to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44370:35"/>

He would not, but prints in a way that proclaimes to the world, that he loo es on me and all the soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties of Antipaedobaptists as persons intolerable. Infant-baptisme we see to be a manifest corruption, we know it hath no precept or example ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse or virtual in Scripture, that it with infant-communion began some ages from Christs birth upon the conceit of necessity to save an infant from perishing: we know it is a duty to be baptized, yea by Christ made a concurring requisite to salvation with believing, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 16. and so a fundamental by Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> rule in his addition to the preface of the second part of his <hi>Saints everlasting rest,</hi> where he defines Fundamentals <hi>Those things which God hath made the conditions of salvation.</hi> Infant-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers will not baptize believers, yea they inveigh, abhorre both the opinion and practise we conceive a necessary important duty. We can scarce come to their meetings, but we must heare the truth bitterly declaimed against, persons that hold it reviled, error published, infant-baptisme practised; if we be silent we are judged to consent, if we speake it makes an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare: we are painted out so deformed as that men are almost afraid to have speech with us, or to hear us, or to joine in communion with us. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates are by writings and Sermons incited against us. I know not what we can do lesse then be baptized as Christ appoints, and receive the Lords Supper. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> page 341. <hi>counts the error of the old and new Socinians denying the continuance of baptisme as a standing ordinance in the Church, nothing so bad as my opinion, upon a frivolous pretence as if I made void the end of baptisme in that where in the true end of baptisme is preserved, which is that the baptized engageth himself to be Christs disciple.</hi> So that even as the rigid Lutherans for their Consubstantiation had rather joine with Papists then Calvinists, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is more willing to comply with that Antichristian, and I had almost said Atheistical way of living above ordinances, then favour Anabaptists. In this case if there be schisme in our practise, let all the world judge whether we be not passive rather then active, and whether the true cause of it be in us, or Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives and actings against us. We make not schisme, but suffer it: Mr. <hi>B.</hi> by this last book hath done more to promote it then any Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist I know, and how farre the wayes of other Antagonists have been from peace, the intelligent will perceive though I be silent. <hi>Contempt and reproach of Godly Ministers</hi> by men of opposite parties, is very frequent and mutual. I have often endeavoured, but cannot expresse it: yet that

societies of Anabaptists as they are a body do so I do not find. As for <hi>obedience to Governours further then they please them,</hi> the moderne so called Anabaptists in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> may vye with their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The accidents of this year in <hi>England</hi> which I am unwilling to mention, may serve to wipe away the reproach of Anabaptists in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect. <hi>Covenant-breaking</hi> till instance be given wherein is so general a charge that an answer cannot be given. I know men are taken to break Covenant who conceive they keep it. <hi>Neglect of the Lords day</hi> I think cannot be charged on the societies of Anabaptists, however it may be on some members. Some of the leaders of them appear sound in this point. Mr. <hi>Blackwood Apostol. bapt. The Jewish Sabbath being put to an end,</hi> Col. 2. 16. <hi>we observe the Lords day from the Apostles example, and the morality of the fourth Com. which requires one day in seven. Mr.</hi> Edward Harrison <hi>Paedobapt. oppugned</hi> page 4. <hi>makes the rule for one day in seven moral and natural, and the altering the day simply Evangelical from Apostolical example, which having not meerly temporary reason is enough to prove an institution from Christ, which sort of proof we have,</hi> Acts 20. 7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1, 2. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> knowes the Protestant Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond-sea more guilty of loosenesse in opinion and practise about the Lords day then English Anabaptists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When Mr. <hi>B.</hi> speaks <hi>of their rolling down the hill so fast in placing their religion in full mouth'd oathes and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, &amp;c.</hi> it is very hard for Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to charge that upon them, which is the act of some particular persons whom they condemne, and warne others of, and whereof not a few have been of other societies then theirs. My second instance 500. years ago I have vindicated before.

To Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> charging of me <hi>of untruths, and covetousnesse, and malice, and contempt of my brethren</hi> page 202, 203. there is an answer made before and after where speeches and practises to prove these are objected. He chargeth me <hi>with pride in my usual way of putting off the authority of their arguments and judgements with a contemptuous smile, or wonder at the sillinesse of them.</hi> But therein there is no despising of their persons, but onely of their arguments: which if I know to be weak I dare not make shew as if I counted them strong: that were to put darknesse for light, and if I do shew dislike with a smile or wonder (though others rather say I do reject them with anger mistaking my earnestnesse in speaking for that passion) this is usually lesse offensive then alteration of wordes. And if I use wondering at their sillinesse, I am sure Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is not behind me in this book, whose frequent exclamations of sillinesse, &amp;c. are to be seene where he had little or no cause but the defect of his own apprehension, as shall appear in the examining his book, and therefore if for this I be judged proud Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should do well to search him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self who differs from the most learned and godly in the world in more things then I do, and I imagine with more peremptorinesse and lesse evidence then I bring from my adversaries own confessions. <hi>Perfidiousnesse he chargeth me not with: it is a great question in this age whether it be a sin.</hi> Answ. I think it is no question whether breaking of Covenants and oathes be a sin: but whether the not setling uniformity according to the advice of the Assembly at Westminster, the not conjoining with the Scots, the engagement to the present government, &amp;c. be perfidiousnesse or no Wherein if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hold the affirmative, it's very probable there will be found some to encounter with him, when his arguments are seen in writing. What he tells me, <hi>that my not reproving the prophaning the Lords day, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing my self from resolving the question concerning its morality hath no good savour,</hi> is a charge which I imagine comes from some tale brought Mr. <hi>B.</hi> whereby he is abused. I have spoken against prophaning the Lords day as I have judged meet in the places I have preached: my judgement about its morality is succinctly set down <hi>Examen</hi> part 2. sect. 8. At <hi>Bewdley</hi> I did often in my prefaces before I began morning-exercises at the chappel on the Lords day presse them to the observation of it, and in my Cursory
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44370:37"/>
Exposition of the three first chapters of the Revelation on publique fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, and of <hi>Genesis</hi> on the Lords day, delivered my self more fully in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 10. And when the question was propounded in the weekly meeting we had to edifie one another, <hi>Whether the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every first day of the week as a Sabbath, be of Divine institution?</hi> I resolved it at the next meeting <hi>affirmatively.</hi> And after I had in one or two Lectures (for so I may call my dictates at <hi>Bewdley</hi> in resolving their hard questions) cleared the termes, 1. Concerning the measure of the first day of the week, examining whether precisely 24. houres, and when to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and when to end, are necessary for the account of the time, resolving it to be measured for observation as we do other dayes for working, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing time for necessities. 2. Concerning the observation of a Sabbath, what is requisite thereto; wherein I resolved that it is to be observed by rest and holinesse, about both which I resolved many cases. At the next time I drew the substance of my proof into this one syllogisme. If solemne worship of God in full congregations be required of God, and fixed dayes be necessary thereto, and observed by all or most Nations even Heathens, nor belongs it to any but God to appoint it to his service, and God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a seventh day Sabbath from the beginning, and commanded it in the fourth Commandement a mong the morals, and the Apostles distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from other dayes the Lords day by title, precept and example, as appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to God, and Christians with common consent so took it, and used it after their dayes the Jewish Sabbaths being abrogated, then the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every first day of the week as a Sabbath is of Divine institution. But solemn worship of God, &amp;c. <hi>Ergo.</hi> The sequel of the Major I stood not long in proving, supposing some morality of a Sabbath being infolded in the first institution and the fourth Commandement and the Apostles fixing that on the Lords day, is a sufficient declaration of Gods mind to have it observed. But the Minor I proved by parts. And after I had proved the two first Propositions, by reason first of the failing of the meeting through some sad accidents, and then the removing of my dwelling &amp; books, and my seldome being with them, I did not prosecute it till one moved that I would resolve them about that question, whether it were to tempt me or otherwise they know who had a hand in it. I told them what I had done already, and that of what I had begun I had not any breviate about me, but I conceived that in my study I had, and therefore I desired their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite till my next comming to them, that I might by reviewing what I had done and adding some further reading fit my self to resolve them: in which they seemed to rest, but it's likely some or othertold Mr. <hi>B.</hi> of this, who
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44370:37"/>
I perceive wanted not tale-bearers, and he <hi>in imagine</hi> sticks not to interpret this my respite (which he calls an excuse from resolving the question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the morality of the Lords day, though I had long before resolved it, but had not fully confirmed my argument) as having some ill savour of licentiousnesse, though about a moneth after I repaired to them, and so fully confirmed the other seven Propositions, that the company (who were as many of the best-affected and intelligent there as the roome could hold) declared themselves satisfied thereabout. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> also page 258. saies of my exceptions against one story in the book of <hi>Gods judgements on Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breakers, he is jealous lest it be from no good will to the doctrine of the morality of the Christian Sabbath, as being against the scope of the book,</hi> though the occasion shew it was onely to prove the uncertainty of relations, that men may not rest on them as proofes of a truth. But I perceive as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is very prone to have hard thoughts of me, so both he and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> seek advantage to create prejudice against me about this point of the Lords day, which makes me more full in my clearing my self in this thing, and in other things, not so much regarding my own personal esteeme, as desirous to prevent that indirect way of wounding the truth through my sides. I would have no man adhere to my tenet because it's mine, nor would I have any to reject it because it is mine. I know too much evil by my self, yet not in the things in which I am accused, at least not in that degree in which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> accuseth me. Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> telling me in print this manner of crimes not proved, but imagined is no whit justified by the rules and examples he brings: his ranking me with seducers I defy, and know that I shall better be able to prove it against him, then he against me.</p>

The first and second will be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be no absurdities in examining the first part of his book chap. 6. The third is no absurdity, understanding it of visible membership by profession of their own, in which notion I said in the dispute I understood visible Church-membership, as commonly Protestant Divines do. Upon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion the fourth and many other of them were spoken by me (if they were spoken by me) I cannot remember, nor what limitations or explications I then used, but this I conceive was my meaning, that infants of the Jewes were not visible Church-members in the wildernesse in that manner they were when they had circumcision, that is, by their visible particular note or mark, and yet then they were visible in the lump, the whole congregation being then Gods visible Church: in which sense they were then visible, and so the women too who were not circumcised. And when I said no infant can be said to be a visible Church-member without some act of his own: I meant it of visibility according to the note of visibility in the Christian Church. Which things being rightly understood, there was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther absurdity, nor contradiction in my speeches, nor any thing against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, nor deserving such derision as was in Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and his collegues, though perhaps through distraction of thoughts chiefely occasioned by Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> concealing the notion in which he used the terme [visible] which I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in vain assayed to understand from him, or forgetfulnesse, or scantnesse of words I did not expresse my self clearly. This is answer sufficient about the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, nineth, sixteenth pretended ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities. The tenth a candid man would have conceived rather to have been <hi>lapsum linguae,</hi> a flip of speech, then <hi>errorem mentis,</hi> a fault of mind,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44370:39"/>
and that however a mistake might slip from me (a thing very incident to the most learned in the heat of dispute, yea sometimes in preaching, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and writing) yet I meant [visibility] to be the adjunct, and the persons visible to be the subject. The eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no absurdities, the Church-visibility of infants then being from that imperfect Church-frame, which was to continue onely till Christ came, and was clogged with many burdens, which by Christs coming all were mercifully freed from, as, to go up to Jerusalem thrice a year, &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any losse of mercy to infants, though it were for a time a mercy to them: which will be morefully cleared (God assisting) in answering Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment p. 1. chap. 6. The fourteenth is no absurdity, as I then to my best remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance expressed it, though Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> juvenility thought fit to make sport with it, that the elect people of the Jews were natural (not as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sets it down naturally) that is according to nature, in that they were descended from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> (the roote of the Church of believers) by natural generation, and so natural branches, yet not by nature, that is, natural abilities or works of their own, but by grace as the efficient cause, <hi>Rom,</hi> 11. ver. 5, 6. To conceive it, the olive there notes a race of men who were the Church of believers, which because after <hi>Abraham</hi> the roote it was first in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Nation, is called their own olive: ver. 24. Of which <hi>Abraham</hi> is ver. 16, 18. made the roote bearing two sorts of branches, some ingraffed who were the Gentile believers, some natural the Jewes, and he is a roote under a double habitude, one as a natural Father, and another as Father of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Both sorts of branches are by the Apostle made to stand in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the roote as branches of the Church of believers or the invisible, the one natural in that they were not proselyted or ingraffed, but came of <hi>Abraham</hi> by natural generation, the other proselyted or ingraffed by believing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, besides the natural way of descent from <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet both united in <hi>Abraham</hi> the common roote of believers, and in the olive-tree the Church of believers, as particular branches thereof: yet neither by nature, that is, by vertue of natural generation, as the Apostle deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 8. but by election of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 5, 6. And whereas Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells me, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 24. sayes both, he is mistaken. For 1. it is not said that any was a branch of the roote <hi>Abraham</hi> by nature, but that the ingraffed branches were antecedently to their ingraffing in the olive wild by nature: nor is it said of the branches from the roote that are called na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, that they were branches in the true olive by nature, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would have it to prove them of the visible Church by nature: but that they were branches of that olive or race of men who were not wilde by nature, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44370:40"/>
is Gentiles bringing no fruit to God, but of that olive which was descended from <hi>Abraham</hi> by natural generation, which was the Church of God till broken off. 2. Whereas the translation turnes <gap reason="foreign">

The book of divers questions of the Holy Scripture unto King</hi> Antiochus; <hi>for therein great</hi> Athanasius <hi>is cited.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>M.</hi> or his friend hath these words <hi>ubi supra. These wordes then which are safe and sound, grounded upon tho same Scripture which I have much insisted on are read in the works of</hi> Athanasius: <hi>where the question is about infants dying requiring a resolution, that might clearely set whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they go to be punished or to the Kingdome. The answer is, seeing the Lord said, Suffer little children to come unto-me, for of such is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven. And the Apostle sayes; Now your children are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (observe the Gospel-ground the same that I build upon) it is manifest that the infants of believers which are baptized do as unspotted and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enter into the Kingdome. This assertion is owned by all the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches]</hi> But had Mr. <hi>M.</hi> or his friend recited the words fully then it would have appeared how impertinently the words are alleadged to prove
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44370:40"/>
the baptizing of infants by vertue of federal holines from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. &amp; that none of the Reformed Churches would own the doctrine of that Author, being built on no Gospel-ground, but Popish opinion of <hi>Limbus infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> For the entire words are these <hi>Qu.</hi> 114. <hi>ad Antiochum, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go dying infants to punishment or the Kingdome? and where are the infants of believers dying unbaptized disposed, with the believers or unbelievers?</hi> Answ. <hi>The Lord saying, Suffer little children to come: for of such is the Kindome of heaven, and again the Apostle saying, But now are your children holy, it is manifest that the infants of believers baptized go into the Kingdome as unspotted and believing: but the unbaptized and Heathenish neither go into the Kingdome nor into punishment: for they have done no sin.</hi> Which answer plainly determines that infants of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers if baptized enter into the Kingdome: but neither the unbaptized infants of believers or Heathens enter into the Kingdome or punishment: for they have done no sin. Not a word of federal holinesse, but the plain Popish doctrine that infants dying unbaptized go to <hi>limbus infantum,</hi> but the baptized into the Kingdome of heaven: which is the same with the doctrine father'd on <hi>fustin Martyr.</hi> qu. 56. <hi>ad orthod.</hi> Now this is contrary to what the reformed Churches assert even from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. that the children of believers are federally holy afore baptisme, and go into the Kingdome though they die unbaptized. Nor doth the alleadging 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. prove that the Author observed the Gospel-ground (more truly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tievangelical or Jewish) which Mr. <hi>M.</hi> buildeth on. For the holinesse in that Author is meant either of holinesse in possibility in being likely to be baptized, because believing parents would likely breed them up in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity and they be baptized, in which sense <hi>Tertull. de anima</hi> c. 39. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundes the Apostle as calling them holy not in act barely by descent from a believer, but because <hi>designati sanctitatis,</hi> or as <hi>Hierome Epist.</hi> 153. <hi>ad Paulinum</hi> alledging, <hi>Tertullian de monogamia, quod candidati sint fidei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et nullis idololatriae sordibus polluantur,</hi> which <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his glosse on <hi>Hierom,</hi> renders thus, <hi>quodvelut ambiunt et exspectant baptismum;</hi> or else of actual holinesse in being baptized, believers being wont to baptize their infants when neare danger of death not by reason of Covenant-holinesse, but the giving of grace by baptisme, and the necessity of it to save an infant from perishing. I am still confident that neither Father nor Interpreter preceding the sixteenth century did interpret 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. of holinesse of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to God as visible Church-members by Gods Covenant to them: Nor doth <hi>Chamier panstras.

Nevertheless I find it used above an hundred times in the New Testament, in <hi>Matthew</hi> 10. and 6. of them it is traslated authority, and in most places where it is transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power, it might be translated authority, and if it be used for liberty in any of these places, yet it is no where used for a veile but one, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. and I doubt not but it is used for authority, or power, or liberty many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of times in the Lxx Greek of the old Testament, though I have not a Greek Concordance of the old Testament, to number them by, and therefore there is neither absurdity, nor untruth in any speech any more then in that <hi>John</hi> 21. 15. though I conceive there is scarce need of an hyperbole to verifie it, but am sure Mr. <hi>B.</hi> trifles in putting this into the score of my ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities to which I was driven. To the nineteenth I do not remember <hi>I said, the Corinthians doubted whether their living together were fornication.</hi> My resolution and exposition of the Apostles words will be made good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this exception, in answering Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> fifth argument c. 29. of the first part, which I intend to fit for the presse with as much speed as I can. To the twentieth I have in my <hi>Examen</hi> of Mr. <hi>Ms. Sermon, Exercit.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44370:41"/>
Antidote and Review</hi> shewed a ground of necessity to take the Apostles words, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. in my sense, not in Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> the reply to which made by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will appear to be insufficient upon the examination of chap. 29. of the first part of his book. The one &amp; twentieth absurdity which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would fasten on my arguing <hi>as most absurd, and like a right A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptist</hi> (in his scoffing language) is meerly from his mistake of my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, as if by <hi>present prayer</hi> I meant prayer coexistent and continued during the use of the thing sanctified: whereas my meaning was to exclude an habit of prayer without the act, and actual prayer interrupted in its course, through lapse into such sin as <hi>Davids</hi> adultery, in which time things are not sanctified to real believers till repentance restore their sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying exercise. And so the two and twentieth and four and twentieth absurdities which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> makes so <hi>horrid,</hi> are also answered, nor was the three and twentieth an absurdity. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself page 98. limits the speech <hi>[all things are pure to the pure] that is, all things good and lawfull;</hi> and is not this all one as to say <hi>[some things are pure;]</hi> nor is it unusual to limit such universal termes, as the matter requires, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. &amp; 10. 23. &amp;c. The twentiefith and twentiesixth were no absurdities, but fit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to so trifling arguments. For the terme [disciple] importing one that hath learned, it is but trifling to argue [infants of believers are disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples] without proving they have learned; and the reason why they have not learned is because they are untaught; and if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had further asked why they are not taugh, I would have answered, because ordinarily uncapable, and God both not extraordinarily shewn them this mercy: But because I perceived he was about to leave the plain way of proving them disciples, by shewing that the notation and use of the word disciple (which himself page 92. confesseth to come from the act of learning) did agree to them, never imagining that ridiculous sense in which he takes the word [disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple] page 14. as a relation without a foundation without actual learning for the present, or so much as an assay, intention or capacity to learn, and making actual learning the end of an Infants being a disciple, who hath no thoughts of it, and that he sought to winde about an intangling discourse about Gods mercy to Infants, which though it were but frivolous in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the thing to be proved, to wit, the appliablenesse of the word [disciple] to Infants, yet being popular and pausible, would be taking with the Auditors (which I quickly perceived he affected). I conceived on the sudden the answers I gave fittest, and so still do think. The last in number is no absurdity, but if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> put in [actual] used by him in the dispute, and understand it of circumcision as acted barely, not as taught,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44370:42"/>
and put in the terme [yoke] it is Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> absurdity to maintain the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as is proved above.

My <hi>arguing to prove the repeale of infants Church-membership</hi> was onely <hi>lamentable,</hi> in that it met with such a contemptuous respondent, who judgeth that <hi>idem, per idem,</hi> which was rationally thus. The repeale of Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bership was proved from the altering the Church-state from Jewish natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to Christian personal, this proved from the different call, this proved from the different way God took to gather his Church in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Old, by preaching not authority of superiors as when he brought the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Jewish Nation into Covenant. What the Ministers (so called) which sate next Mr. <hi>B.</hi> judged I passe not. They were much deceived in their judgement about my arguing, and my being mated and puzzled then. What ever puzzling I had was in the beginning, when I was almost at a stand what to answer, and therefore varied my answers by reason of my not understanding where that ordinance of infants visible Church-membership unrepealed Mr. <hi>B.</hi> speakes of is, and in what sense Mr. <hi>B.</hi> called them visible Church-members and disciples under the Goipel, which then I understood not, nor did he explaine so as that I could clearly understand him, nor so fully since by his book, but that by much diligence I am fain to pick it out by comparing one passage and expression with another. It is untrue <hi>that not knowing what to say I was resolved to say something, lest if I were silent the people should think I were worsted,</hi> or that <hi>I requested him to name my absurdities: or that by private confessions or by my own confession I was conscious of absurdities I was driven to.</hi>

For, 1. However <hi>the motion was not sudden, nor the yielding to it sudden, yet the assault was sudden,</hi> without any rules for orderly mannaging the dispute, or notaries on both sides to take it, &amp;c. which I imprudently ommitted, not expecting such a solemne meeting as I found, and because of the opinion I had of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> as more candid in taking my answers, and explaining himself, and yielding to other things which might sift the truth, then I found him. 2. It is not true, <hi>I forced Mr.</hi> B. <hi>to the dispute.</hi> The words of my letter dated <hi>December</hi> 27. 1649. foure dayes before the dispute were these. Sir, <hi>my message was this, sith I intend on the next Lords day to prosecute what I have begun in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the</hi> Hypotheses, <hi>upon which the argument from circumcision for infant-baptisme (which is the Paedobaptists</hi> Achilles) <hi>is built, I was willing to invite you to be a hearer, and if you judged it meet to oppose what you should think good in a Logick way without Rhetorick: Yet if you choose to come over either Munday or Tuesday, I shall be ready to justifie my doctrine openly, or privately by word or writing as it shall be judged convenient.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> choosing <hi>Tuesday Jan.</hi> 1. a seat was provided for him with some kind of State, Ministers and Schollers (such as they were) sent for over the Countrey, placed on each side Mr. <hi>B.</hi> which with Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> carriage in the beginning to propound that question (which I had not then meddled with in my Sermons or printed books) about the manner of baptizing, and in that manner as served for no other purpose but to create prejudice, besides his fallacious disputing in the beginning, did cause appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions in me of the designe of bearing down me and the truth by indirect wayes, which before I dreamed not of: which if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> were not privy to yet was he instrumental to promote, which I confesse did not a little perplex me and streightned my thoughts and expressi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons. 3. That Mr. <hi>B.</hi> did <hi>conceale his arguments</hi> me thinks he should not deny, who denies not that he would not give me animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions on my written notes, nor let me have his arguments in writing. To the rest of his questions answer enough is already given. 4. It <hi>is no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth that I had scarce time afforded me to repeale his arguments:</hi> yea at first it was expressely denied me till Mr. <hi>Good</hi> informed Mr. <hi>B.</hi> that it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44370:43"/>
was the rule of Schools the Respondent should repeat the arguments. And it was once confessed ingenuously that Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> syllogismes were so long as that they could not be easily repeated: which was very true of some of them, contrary to the use of Schools being hypothetical syllogismes to prove an hypothetical proposition. It is true that Mr. <hi>B. would open his termes,</hi> viz. the chief terme [visible Church-member] when I asked him by what note he meant Infants were discernable as visible Church-members, he did not tell me his note to my best remembrance, and when I did distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of visible by profession, or some other way, because I did not express the other member of the distinction (though I could not do it till he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained what other way he conceived as being a visible Church-member besides profession) he derided me. 6. It is true also <hi>that he checked me with Satyrical quips, as that he could not help my memory, when I did not repeate rightly</hi> his long syllogisme, <hi>hat he came not to be catechized,</hi> when I asked him of his meaning about the terme [visible]. His speech of my defying the armies of Israel, and calling, give me a man to dispute, &amp;c. for my uncircumcised opinion is conservant with Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ley</hi> their unjust and false charges of me to which I answered in my <hi>Apology</hi> sect. 7. and Mr. <hi>Bs</hi> insulting speech thereupon is not without shew of vain glory. Page 211. <hi>He blames me for desiring his arguments in writing, though not denying the validity of any one of his reasons against writing, many mens writings being yet unaswered by me, my answer to Mr.</hi> Ms. <hi>Defence being weak, that I have done him great injury in forcing him to write.</hi> Answ. The desire I and others had to see his arguments in writing, was because we could not otherwise well judge of them, which he might easily have done being those as he saith he preached at <hi>Coventrey,</hi> and had written in his book at the dispute, and therefore might have been easily communicated to us. His reasons against writing I took to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses of his unwillingnesse to gratifie us in our request, and that they were meer excuses his printing proveth, to which he <hi>was never ferced by me,</hi> as he falsely pretends in his title page, and if he be injured it is by himself, whose own minde, or some others designe using him as their instrument, carried him to it; and though I am glad to see his arguments in writing, yet I take it for the greatest injury that ever I received from man, that he hath so unworthily abused me and the truth, (which I pray God forgive him) expecting also if he live both righting me and the truth. Of answering Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> I have said enough already, Mr. <hi>Church,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords</hi> are in effect the same with Mr. <hi>Ms.</hi> and others: by overthrowing in my Sermons the <hi>Hypotheses</hi> of the Covenant, seal, Baptismes succession

to Circumcision they were answered. Mr. <hi>Drew's</hi> main argument page 23. though his book by the <hi>Author of the lawfulnesse of obeying the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent govenrment be judged to be written with sharp reasons and mild lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> yet either there are foure termes in it, or else it concludes we are to circumcise. The dispute of Mr. <hi>Baily</hi> had been shewed to be very fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious, if my letter to the press had found one willing to print it. I desired to have Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> arguments in writing besides these, because he was better known to those of <hi>Bewdley.</hi> I compare not my self with men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in writing, nor do I think I used the terme <hi>[silly people]</hi> though Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> notary so wrote it, page 212. How unseemly Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> language was I have said afore. I conceived it necessary Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should explain his termes to satisfie the people, who could not judge of his proof without knowing his meaning, which might have been done, and yet strict disput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing observed: which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> denied, though this were or should have been the end of the dispute, and the occasion of it led him to it. If [for peace] and [for fear of scandal] be equipollent (as I take them to be in these speeches) then [Truth must not be lost for fear of scandal] and [no truth is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed so as to be lost for peace] differ not as much as truth <hi>from a most destructive falsehood, as Mr.</hi> B. <hi>saith</hi> page 215. <hi>Austin</hi> I think hath the words I cited in that Sermon, my <hi>book of scandals</hi> page 273. and in my <hi>Apology</hi> page 5. though perhaps I am mistaken, and the speech be <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories,</hi> whose words in his seventh <hi>homily</hi> on <hi>Ezech.</hi> are thus cited by <hi>Aqu.</hi> 2. 2. q. 43. art. 7. <hi>Si de veritate scandalum sumitur ut tilius nasci permittur scandalnm quam veritas relinquatur.</hi> My tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in my pulpit, mentioned page 217. was nothing but citing his words, which was not frequent, nor is it, if rightly done, any injury when the book is published.

Mr. <hi>B.</hi> opposeth it, as if I meant a <hi>man must not suspend any truth of the Scripture, no not though a total breach bringing bloodshed, ruine, &amp;c. follow;</hi> yea by his last argument he would insinuate, as if it would follow on my tenet, <hi>that every one that doth but think it is a truth that Christ is not God, that there is no God, &amp;c. that he will think himself bound to reveale it to the world, though it turne all to confusion, and after his</hi> satyrical veine saith, <hi>He that had rather see the Church in this case then his doctrine of Anabaptistry should be concealed, is good for nothing but to make an Anabaptist of that I know.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, my meaning in that speech of mine was this, that no truth of God that a person is certain is such, and can demonstrate so to be, which concernes the faith or practise of Christians, through concealing of which they shall erre and sin, is to be concealed when a person may perceive by circumstances, that if he conceale it at such a time the contrary will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished, and so truth be lost in the eye of reason, though much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble follow thereon. And this I resolved heretofore in my book of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals chap. 4. sect. 20. not that I know of excepted against by any ground on <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 5. avouched by many Divines, and without which the Waldenses, Hussites, Protestants will be condemned for oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Monkish profession, halfe communion, &amp;c. though warres fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thereon. And our present and former non-conformists will be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guilty of sin in opposing the Prelacy, ceremonies, canons, &amp;c, which hath been one cause of the great troubles of the land, which have proved greater then any raised by the Anabaptists. And so far as many prudent men can discerne, many of the Presbyterian Ministers of the land, do as little regard the peace of this land at this time, through discontent that they want the establishment of discipline after their mind, as any Anabaptist heretofore did. And I presume they that sit at the sterne do find the so called Anabaptists as faithful to the publique cause as their opposites.</p>
               <p>As for the two next errors about others then Ministers baptizing and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring the Lords Supper, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> delivers as much himself as the errors preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded affirm in these words page 221. <hi>In a case of necessity (as if people were in the</hi> Indies) <hi>where no Ministers can be had, if any fay that it is better a

private man baptize and adminster the Lords Supper then wholly omit them, I will not deny it;</hi> and he gives two reasons. But faith he, Mr. <hi>T. speaks it in reference to our ordinary case in</hi> England. Concerning which I answer, that for baptizing it is true I speak in reference to the case in <hi>England;</hi> all or most of the Ministers ordained <note place="margin">Tertullian. l. de baptismo Laicis jus est baptizandi.</note> being against baptizing of persons of years sprinkled in infancy, and there lying upon them that see infant-baptisme a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption a necessity to be baptized upon profession of faith, there is a necessity that they be baptized by persons not ordained by laying on of hands of the Presbytery, though I do conceive laying on of hands an ordinance in force from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 23. and 4. 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 2. Nor do I like the argument from <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. 10. to prove that non-preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elders may lay on hands conceiving no Mosaical ordinance concerning any positive ceremonial rite belonging to the Jewish service is a rule to us now, and therefore do wish there were either by authority or consent of Churches some way of restoring it; till which I see a necessity that persons not ordained yet preachers of the Gospel do baptize. But for admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the Lords Supper though I acknowledge it most fit in many respects it should be received some Minister ordering it, not so much for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating of the Elements (as they call it) by vertue of office, as for the comely and edifying dispensing of it by prayer and exhortation, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance being holy, and to be performed with much reverence, to which none are so fit as a Minister that is set apart for the word and prayer: yet whereas it is claimed as a part of the Ministers office to be Minister of the Sacraments, or (as they call them) seales, and it is aggravated as if it were the sin of <hi>Uzzah</hi> or <hi>Uzziah</hi> for any else to do it, and too much I think is ascribed not onely by Papists, but also by others to the power of order, and many require it as a Ministers duty to give them the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> doctrine be good in his treatise of the Saints rest page 651. Their being baptized persons or members of the universal Church, is sufficient evidence of their interest to the Supper, till they by heresie or scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal blot that evidence, Ministers cannot deny it them without instustice, and hereupon many perplexities are in Ministers about giving the Lords Supper, and perplexities in receivers from whom they receive it, it being taught that they do justifie their Ministery, and own them as their Ministers, who receive the Lords Supper from them; and it is taught that Ministers have a power to deny some the seals, and this is made a chief part of their government, I have I confesse said and I think it still true, that a company of believers though they have no Minister ordained in case of want of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44370:45"/>
Minister may some one or more in holy and seemely manner by giving thanks, praying, and declaring the end and use of that rite, and guiding the action, remember the Lords death in breaking bread, and this may be truly a Sacrament as it is called, and acceptable to God if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with a holy heart. And my chief ground is, because whereas it is made one of the chief disorders in eating the Lords Supper at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20, 21. that <hi>in eating every one took his own Supper before other,</hi> this could not have happened if they had been wont to receive it from a Minister that distributed to all; and when the Apostle to rectifie the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse sets down <hi>what he received of the Lord,</hi> ver. 23. he speaks not a word of a Ministers duty to regulate them, or of Christs appointing it as a part of his office to distribute it, nor gives any direction to that end: but only ver. 33. that they <hi>tarry one for another, and not eat till they came together,</hi> whereas if it did then belong to the Minister to distribute, the direction should have been given to him not to distribute till they came together. If it be said (as <hi>Saravia</hi> against <hi>Beza)</hi> that there were then Presbyters at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, though I conceive it not likely, but the contrary rather manifest from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 7. &amp; 6. 4. &amp; 12. 28. &amp; 14. 29. Yet it serves the more to confirme my opinion, that then it was not counted the Ministers office to deliver the Lords Supper, and that it might be without a Minister ordained, sith they did receive it then, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. yet I acknowledge that it is very antient that the Minister called the President did order the Lords Supper, as I gather from <hi>Justin Martyrs Apolog.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Antoninum</hi> where he sets down the order of the Christian service in his time. And I am against the altering it because of the antiquity of the use, and the confusion likely to follow on the alteration. But being urged by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and others in the manner abovesaid, it is necessary that the point be examined. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> argues thus, 1. <hi>He that administreth the Lords Supper (in breaking the bread, delivering it to all, bidding them take, eate, &amp;c.) must represent the Lord Jesus, who did all this at the institution. But onely Ministers and no private men are persons who should represent the Lord Jesus in Church-administrations.</hi> Therefore <hi>onely Ministers and no private men may administer the Lords Supper.</hi> To which I answer, 1. [in <hi>Church-administrations]</hi> in the Minor is added which was not in the Major, and so there are four termes, and the argument faulty. 2. But waving that exception, because it may be quickly rectified, I deny the Minor understanding as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> doth by a Minister a Presbytery or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by laying on of hands. For to speak of the Ruling elders Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>administrations, or the preaching of persons not in office (of which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44370:45"/>
anon) It is certain that Deacons have Church-administration, who are not Presbyters; yea it is manifest out of antiquity, that the Deacons did deliver the Elements in the Lords Supper, and <hi>Rogers</hi> on Article 23. <hi>of the Church of England,</hi> prop. 3. saith, <hi>at Geneva the elder (a lay-man) ministreth the cup ordinarily at the Communion,</hi> and therefore Ministers did and might represent Christ at least in that part of Church-administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> goes about to prove the Minor thus. <hi>Ministers onely are called his Embassadors, Stewards of his mysteries, and beseech in his stead,</hi> &amp;c. Answer, 1. I think that those mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 4, 5. of whom <hi>Philip</hi> was then onely a Deacon, as many of the Antients hold, not onely <hi>Apollos</hi> but also <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> Acts 18. 26. <hi>Frumentius</hi> that converted the <hi>Indians,</hi> and the captive maid that brought the <hi>Iberians</hi> to the faith, were Embassadours of Christ, and Stewards of his mysteries, and might beseech in his stead. 2. But were it granted that Ministers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are called Christs Embassadours, &amp;c. how is it proved that they onely should represent Christs person in breaking the bread, delivering it to all, bidding them take, eate, &amp;c. Doth the Embassage of Christ, dispensing of his mysteries, beseeching in his stead, &amp;c. consist in breaking bread, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, bidding take, eate, &amp;c? If it do, then a non-preaching Minister who doth these things may yet be an Embassadour of Christ, and Steward of his mysteries, then the breaking bread, &amp;c. is a converting ordinance, as Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> held, which Mr. <hi>Gillespy</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> deny. For my part I think to be an <hi>Embassadour of Christ, and to beseech in his stead,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. <hi>to be a Steward of the mysteries of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 1. are all one as to preach the Gospel, and that the Assembly did misallege the text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. as they have done the other, to prove that neither Sacrament may be dispensed by any but a Minister of the word lawfully ordained, Confession of faith chap. 27. sect. 4.

                  <hi>usurpari pro ipso rei sacrae signo profectò imposturaest.</hi> But Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells me. <hi>It is a silly answer of Mr.</hi> T. <hi>that Sacraments are not called mysteries of God.</hi> For the word <hi>preached neither is not the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it self, but a revealing and exhibiting that mystery, and so are the Sacraments. The one revealeth them to the eare, and the other to the eye.</hi> Answ. Sure if the answer be silly, the refutation is no better. For if the word preached be not the mystery it self, then neither is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much lesse the breaking the bread and delivering it, and so to be Steward of the mysteries of God is not to be breaker and deliverer of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44370:46"/>
bread and wine in the Lords Supper. But however Mr. <hi>B.</hi> grants that though the word preached be not the mystery it self, yet it is the revealing and exhibiting of the mystery, and that the sense undoubted of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Stewards of the mysteries of God,</hi> is revealers of the mystery of God by preaching the word. But then saith Mr. <hi>B. the Sacrament reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the mystery of God to the eye.</hi> I reply, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith so, but not one text of Scripture saith so: nor is it true. The mystery containes not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the thing done by Christ, but the end, use, reason of it: but this is perceivable onely by the understanding, and the Sacrament abstractively from the word declares it not, no not so much as a picture: and therefore the Sacramental actions of themselves are not revelations of the mystery of Christ, nor ever so called in Scripture: and therefore I conclude, that the text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. doth not prove that it is the peculiar office of an ordained Presbyter to Minister the Lords Supper by breaking bread, delivering it to all, bidding take, eat, &amp;c. And though the title of Minister of the Gospel be used in the New Testament, yet the title of Minister of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments is a made title. 2. Saith Mr. <hi>B. If there be no command or example in Scripture of any but Ministers administring the Lords Supper, then no other may do it; But there is no command or example in Scripture of any other doing it; they that say there is, let them shew it.</hi> Answ. I find this command, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Let a man examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup,</hi> and this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17. <hi>The cup of blessing which we blesse, is it not the Communion of the blood of Christ? the bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the body of Christ? For we being many are one body and one bread: for we are all partakers of that one bread.</hi> But for command or example that an ordained Presbyter onely should administer the Lords Supper by breaking bread, &amp;c. let them that say there is, shew it. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> goes on. <hi>But by this time you may see whither Mr.</hi> T. <hi>would reduce the Ministerial office,</hi> 1. <hi>Others may baptize.</hi> 2. <hi>And admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the Lords Supper.</hi> 3. <hi>And then preaching is all or almost all that is left (for he gives them far lesse in government than I do.) And how well he defended the Ministerial privilege of publique preaching in his disputes with Captain</hi> Bray <hi>is too well known. And what need the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple allow so much of their meanes then to maintain Ministers? is not this next to the utter extirpation of them acoording to the doctrine of their learned Martin-Marpriest.</hi> Answ. Pastors and Teachers or Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to teach and govern the Church of God I am assured are a Divine institution, and a very merciful gift of Christ, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.

If any go about to extirpate them let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed as an enemy to Christ and his Church. The railing bookes of <hi>Martin-Marpriest,</hi> and such like on the one side; and the slanderous books of Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baillee,</hi> &amp;c. on the other side I abhorre. Yet I fear more danger to the Ministry by the pragmaticalnesse of the Ministers, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their meddling with State matters, then either by <hi>Martin-Marpriests</hi> libels, or my assertions. Would Ministers keep to their studies and the work of Christ in preaching in season and out of season, it would better establish their maintenance and Ministry, then the asserting such a juridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal government and power of dispensing the seales (as they are called) as they do. I ascribe as much to the Ministry as the Scripture gives them. Though the office of preaching whether publique or private be proper to the Minister so as to be his constant imployment, and he ought not to be hindred in it, sith he is to be accountable to God for it: yet publique or private preaching I do not annex to ordained Presbyters as a peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to them, so as none else may be said to be sent or called of God to preach in Scripture sense but they. Notwithstanding what Mr. <hi>Thomas Hall</hi> in his <hi>Pulpit guarded, or my quodam</hi> scholar and worthy friend Mr. <hi>Giles Workman, in his</hi> better temper'd book intitled <hi>Private men no pulpit men,</hi> have said, I still conceive that not onely for trial of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctants, but also upon other occasions persons not ordained may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, yea desired to preach in the pulpits. I find these words in <hi>Bilsons Difference between Christian subjection and Antichristian rebellion, part.</hi> 4. <hi>Strangers also if they were in place were suffered both to teach and blesse in the Church, as well as others that were tied to their cures, by reason that many were sent by the Apostles and by the Holy Ghost to visite the Churches and comfort the Christians as they travailed, and such were according to their knowledge and gift not onely permitted, but also desired to exhort the people, and to give thanks to God in other mens charges, Grot. annot. in</hi> Mat. 4. 23. <hi>Mansit is mos aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu in Ecclesia Christiana ut concessu Episcoporum Scriptur as interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur non presbyteri tantum aut diaconi, sed &amp;</hi>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44370:47"/>
ablest men to vent their peculiar conceits, and oft-times their pernicious errors, not reguarding to preach to the ignorant the clear truths of faith and a holy life in places where they have no Preacher, but to new converts to pervert them, and withdraw them from their able Teachers, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet them and their congregations by frivolous exceptions. And for this reason I was unwilling Captain <hi>Bray</hi> should preach at <hi>Bewdley</hi> when I was there, and when he would preach and bent himself to assert a liberty to all that had Gods sanctifying spirit, and could expresse their minds, to take upon them to teach publiquely what's the meaning of the Scripture, and what doctrines are true and what false, without any skill in arts, yea though he taught error, I did oppose him. Which if it were not so skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and happily done as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> better acquainted with such mens way might have done, yet me thinks my good will might have been accepted. But I see very little I do is well taken, and therefore see it necessary to wait patiently on God till my words and actions though intended for the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of reformation and good of the Ministry, in my <hi>Examen</hi> part. 2. sect. 7 in my <hi>Apology</hi> and elsewhere, be better resented and considered.</p>
               <p>The fourth and fifth error Mr. <hi>B.</hi> chargeth me with as dangerous, and the <hi>root of my error about baptism,</hi> will more fitly come into the body of the dispute, in which I doubt not but I shall shew that both himself and Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> (however he esteem his writings) do recede from the Scripture and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approved authors in their making the New Covenant common to elect and reprobates, in making reprobates interest in the Covenant a fruit of Christs death, denying the absolute promise to be most fitly called the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, hold that a person may not be baptized that is not known to belong to the Covenant of Grace, that God actually seals the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace to reprobates, with sundry other mistakes about Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in general, as if their essence were in being seals of the Covenant of Grace, and deriving thence a right to baptism for believers Infants, though the Covenant be conditional and common to all.</p>
               <p>The fith error of mine he confutes is about the <hi>Magistrates not being an officer of Christ as Mediator.</hi> And he excepts against me for saying in pulpit at <hi>Bewdley it was of dangerous consequence</hi> which he held, though he named not me at any time, and he wrote to me, and I would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it with him. To which I answer, It is true, preaching on <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. the argument leading me to it, I did oppose that doctrine, that the <hi>Magistrate is an officer of Christ the Mediator,</hi> and because Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> book was in some of my Auditors hands, did reade the passage in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorismes page 273. and said it was of dangerous consequence. And
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44370:47"/>
indeed I think it so still. For I think it will follow, that except a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate can shew his commission from Christ, that he is an usurper, and then none is bound to him but to suppresse him, then no infidel is a lawfull Magistrate who denies Christ, and it will be questionable whether this will not extend to a non-churchmember or an excommunicate person, then a Magistrates doing of right to an infidel against a believer, or to one beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever against another, as putting him to death, is an act for Christ as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and if because all power is given to him in heaven and in earth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore magistracy, so as that all power must be derived from Christ as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, then a Fathers power over his child, but sure that is in a Father by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor do I think it any part of the curse; then ruling Presbyters should do the acts of civil Magistrates as having plain title to rule under Christ. Nor do I think Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath answered these arguments or the rest, but that however he proves Magistracy to be from Christs appointment, and to be subordinate to his laws, and accountable to him, and ought to act for him, yet not that the commission of every lawful Magistrate is from him as Mediator. I think it will follow if Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> position be true, that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Christ had not been Mediator, there had been no lawfull Magistrate, and that <hi>Dominium fundatur in gratia,</hi> which was heretofore denied. And sith Christ is heir of all things, and believers onely are Christs, and all theirs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. it would be considered whether by parity of reason the Saints might not intitle themselves to all power, and all mens estates, which was charged on Anabaptists at <hi>Munster.</hi> But I find I digresse, and therefore stop till more liberty draw me to a fuller handling of it.</p>

in my <hi>Exercit.</hi> sect. 18. and cleered in my <hi>Apology</hi> from Mr. <hi>Rogers.</hi> his latter glosse, nor the opinion of Mr. <hi>Bedford,</hi> who judged with the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, <hi>that the Scripture gives us proof onely of the reasonableness of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptisme,</hi> as I gather by Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> I answer to him page 305. Dr. <hi>Field of the Church, fourth book chap.</hi> 20. <hi>The fourth kind of inadition is the continued practise of such things as are neither contained in the Scripture expressely, nor the examples of such practise expressely there delivered, though the grounds, reasons, and causes of the necessity of such practise be there contained, and the benefit or good that followeth it. Of this sort is the Baptism of Infants, which is therefore named a tradition, because it is not expressely delivered in Scripture that the Apostles did baptize In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, nor any expresse precept there found that they should so do. Yet is not this so received by bare and naked tradition, but that we find the Scripture to deliver unto us the grounds of it. Doctor,</hi> Prideaux <hi>fasci. Controv.

To all which I will adde the words of <hi>Theophilus Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyriaco Loucardiensis,</hi> that is Mr. <hi>Young,</hi> as I am informed, an eminent man in the late Assembly, and Mr. <hi>Marshals</hi> friend that holp him in the first part of his <hi>Defence,</hi> in his <hi>Dies Dominica</hi> lib. 1. c. 10. page 54. where he confesseth ingenuously thus. <hi>Anabaptistas Paedobaptismo oblainan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes apertis testimoniis ferire non possumus, vesaniam his teles comprimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> 1. <hi>ex parallelo praecepto de Circumci sione.</hi> 2. <hi>ex praxi Apostalica: quae quum aliquanda fit obscurior, consuetudinem totius Ecclesiae à pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maevis &amp; historicis temporibus adjicimus: juae; licet praefractos Anabop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistas non movebunt; apud prudentes, morigeros, &amp; aejuos renum aesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matores valebunt.</hi> So that according to him, the main weight lies on the custome of the Church, which is falsely imagined to have been from the Apostles, as in some measure is proved in my <hi>Examen</hi> part of the first, not yet shaken by Mr. <hi>Ms. friend</hi> with all his insight Antiquity. From which I inferre, that the Antients and learned afore <hi>Zuinglius</hi> did account In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptism to have been an unwritten tradition, having reason from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, not evident of it self, but to be received for the determination of the Church, and that because it was not fully perfect, therefore Confirmation was added, which was retained in the English Liturgy as necessarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the Lords Supper; nor do many of the best learned Protestants speak much otherwise out of the heat of dispute against Anabaptists. They
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44370:49"/>
are farre from Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> audaciousnesse to assert it as having <hi>plain Scripture proof for it.</hi> The very hesitant resolution of the most learned and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is enough to represse his vain attempt, and to awaken those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on his proofes, and rest on their Infant-sprinkling, and neglect the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of being baptized after profession of faith, being so expressely enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture as a prime important duty for their salvation.</p>

I let passe his jerkes <hi>about my health, and my grievance of removing from</hi> Bewdley, <hi>his way to heaven and mine.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> page 242 would vindicate his passages I cite in the Epistle to the people of <hi>Bewdley:</hi> but he passeth over that which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before in my Epistle, and makes no answer to any of these three things, 1. That he assignes no sufficient note whereby to discerne the visible Church-membership of Infanrs of which he speaks. 2. That there is no connexion between his visible Church-membership of Infants and the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial seal, without institution of the rite to be so used. 3. that in the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive rites of the New Testament, there's no reason to be a rule to us, but the appointers will in some precept or practise. And to shew the precept to be against him his own words are alleged and that rightly, however he interpret or interlace them. His interpretation agrees not with his own passage <hi>Appendix</hi> page 56. which saith, <hi>neither are the seals usefull till the accepting and entring of the Covenant,</hi> where he placeth accepting before entering the Covenant, and in both his passages speakes of accepting and entering with consent, which Infants cannot do, page 243. he saith, <hi>I seem to speak as if I had some of my old Episcopal ceremonious spirit, though he hoped and believed verily that I did not turn meerly to the times, though with the times.</hi> To which I answer. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> was a stranger to me till a little afore these times, and therefore is not fit to charge me
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44370:49"/>
with an Episcopal ceremonious spirit. Were it worth while to trouble the world with it, I could shew how I examined, as well as at those years, I could the points in difference about which I was to subscribe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and however I was carried away with the stream, yet my sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription was according to Doctor <hi>Burges</hi> his explication, and my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity upon Mr. <hi>Spruits</hi> grounds, I was no promoter of either, and in the worst time I think none can say but I stuck fast to the main, the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Gospel and Conjunction with the Godly. And my opposing the Bishops began with the soonest afore this Parliament began, as soon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I deprehended the Bishops to be wholly for their own rule, and adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the preaching of the Gospel. And for my non-conformity, reasons were given with some of the first in a Sermon at a visitation at <hi>Lemster, November</hi> 24. 1641 since printed. And what I said the ceremonies were more excusable then Paedobaptism is true, 1. They were not at first urged otherwise then as indifferent things, Paedobaptism is urged as of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment, and yet the chief principle of non-conformists doth more strongly plead against it then the ceremonies. 2. Paedobaptism not withstanding the palliating salves of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I find farre more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious then the ceremonies; it being, 1. The great occasion of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destroying presumption whereby a great part of men perish, and the genuine hinderance of the reformation of the Lords Supper and Church-communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. it quite perverts the end and use of baptism, which the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies did onely in some sort disorder. I justifie not the ceremonies, and therefore I need not answer the men he names, but their writings yield strong arguments for me against Paedobaptism, and better for me then for themselves. Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> questions page. 243. are upon a mistake, as if I counted all Pedobaptists meer formal teachers: whereas what I speak was in tendernesse to <hi>Bewdley,</hi> lest they out of averseness to my doctrine should rest in a meer formal teacher, which I had reason to fear was the aime of some, whom perhaps Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may find (though I wish he may not) he hath mistaken for godly men. Who perhaps might tell him what was not true, <hi>that the power of godliness is much diminished since my comming to them, and their profitable converse turned into heart-burnings, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies and fruitlesse contendings.</hi> His argument pag. 244. is vain: for were it supposed that <hi>Infants of believers were Church-members</hi> (which his whole book proves not) and it were true that <hi>baptizers cannot otherwise have knowledge when those that are piously educated begin to be Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members,</hi> yet the practise of baptizing the children of Christians ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily at years of discretion overturnes not the true end of Baptism. For whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44370:50"/>
the true (to which he addes <hi>principal</hi> in a <hi>parenthesis,</hi> as if true and principal were all one) end of Baptism be to be Christs sign for solemn ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Church-members or Disciples, or to be an engaging seal as elsewhere; yet both these ends are preserved if they be baptized many years after their being Disciples. It is untrue, <hi>that it is my usual artifice to work on the affections, of people when I mistrust my strength to work on mens understandings;</hi> it may be more truly said of himself, who usually fills up the vacuity of proofs with childish exclamations, admirations, &amp;c. What I said and preached from <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 23. is right, people do indanger <hi>their being cut off from Gods people,</hi> who disobey Christ, in not being baptized when their duty is told them, as the <hi>Pharisees and Lawyers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected or made void the Counsel of God against themselves, being not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of</hi> John <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 30. I preach against popish necessity of Baptism, and yet hold a necessity of precept for believers to be baptized, yea and an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary necessity of means according to Christs doctrine, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 16. I threaten no man for not yielding to my opinion, but not yielding to a plain command of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. and his Apostle, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. &amp;c. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all my Antagonists (except Socinianized) from which Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> observations concerning the backsliding of some cannot acquit him. Were my words of any weight with him, I should advise him, more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to consider whether this his writing be <hi>not a perverting the right wayes of the Lord.</hi> Page 245. that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> did not at <hi>least mainly direct the passage of his Epistle against me,</hi> he will hardly believe that takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the passage, the time when, the texts produced, the accusation it self, the naming me, yea or his own words so often in his book, as page 167. <hi>that he used the speeches to preserve his friends from the danger of my error, that being a dying man he might have no opportunity after to warne his people, that a fire being at</hi> Bewdley <hi>he had reason to provide for</hi> Kederminster. And what though it were intended against all that take my course, yet it might be <hi>directed mainly against me,</hi> whom he singled out for commendation, but yet in such a manner, as I may say with <hi>King James in his answer to Cardinal Perons oration, I defie the prayses</hi> that ascribe <hi>ability and moderation to me,</hi> and charge me not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>grosse absurdities, but also with little tender conscientius fear of erring, playing the Devils part,</hi> besides other imputations, which if not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected against me solely, yet he might have conceived would be taken as chargeable upon me with others. By officiating Priest I meant not any other then meer reading Ministers, by whom most were baptized, and it was not <hi>scornfully</hi> used by me, nor like <hi>the language of Martix-Marpriest</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:44370:50"/>
(which I abhorre) but to in imate that in that respect, as well as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of sprinkling and defect of profession of faith, the Anabaptists so called had reason not to content themselves with Infant-baptism. It is true, our English prelatical Divines do account Baptism sufficiently administred that is so done, yea though it were by a popish Priest or a Midwife, and I think Presbyterians and Independents do agree with them: for they do not question their Baptism, nor seek any other, though it's likely many have been so baptized. Yet I find <hi>Spondanus</hi> in his <hi>Auctar. Chronol. ad annum</hi> 1604. reporting that in <hi>France,</hi> at <hi>Vapincum</hi> in the <hi>Daulphinate,</hi> a Synod wherein famous <hi>Chamier</hi> was President, determined according to a former <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Poictiers, that Baptism administered by expectants of ordination was of no value, and to be iterated by Ministers themselves.</hi> Whether this relation be true or not, yet my end in my expression being to give reason why Anabaptists content not themselves with their pretended Infant-baptism, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> doth ill to interpret my words as <hi>scornfull.</hi> I do now professe as I did not long since at <hi>Coventrey</hi> to Mr. <hi>William Swayn</hi> (who I perceived since upon his misconstruction hath also alleged this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in the end of Mr. <hi>Stephens</hi> book intitled <hi>a precept for Baptism of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants out of the New Testament,)</hi> that I do reverence many Paedobaptists as godly Ministers of the Gospel farre beyond my self. Yet still I say, that they most injuriously inveigh against Anabaptists for being baptized at years of discretion, and thereby necessitate them to associate themselves, when the Baptism of Infants is confessed by the most considerate not to have cleer proof without help of Tradition unwritten; which yet learned men contradict, the sprinkling they have received is not Baptism, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Christ, nor the person adminstring it to many Infants a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Gospel, and many learned men have made Baptisme of Infants imperfect without Confirmation, and Churches have thought it necessary to retain it, yea Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would have something like it (which but for the dipping in cold water is to the same purpose as rebaptizing) page 119. 120. which to me discovers the imperfection and insufficiency of Infant-baptism to its end; and though Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in answer to Mr. <hi>Bedford</hi> holding <hi>baptizing but once onely a tradition unwritten,</hi> undertakes <hi>to prove it fully from Scripture</hi> page 305. (whose performances I find very short of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings) yet <hi>Theophilus Philokyriaces</hi> in the book forenamed page 54. sayes, <hi>sacrum baptismum non repetendum semper statuit Ecclesia: de quo tamen interdicto in sacris tabulis nihil occurrit,</hi> and therefore unless I will speak against my conscience, I must needs say that it is ignorance or wilfulness holds Ministers and people in their stiffe asserting and practise
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44370:51"/>
of Infant-baptism, and the violent opposition they make to their practise who are baptized or baptize believers upon so great reason. He tells me it is <hi>an untruth that he</hi> said <hi>[dipping in cold water is murther and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery]</hi> about which I not contend, whether he used those very termes onely, but so farre as my memory retaines, and the notes I could get relate, those words were used by him without addition of <hi>[the ordinary practise]</hi> or <hi>[naked.]</hi> But my meaning in my denial of his speech, was to justifie dipping as used by those termed Anabaptists, whose baptizing so farre as I have known it, hath been seemly with coverings fit to be quickly put off when they come out of the water, and with meet provision for the health of persons, not tying persons to cold water in the open aire or any other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient thing to health and modesty, but onely requiring the person to be under water resemhling Christs burial and resurrection according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. as the stream of the expositors do conceive the allusion. And therefore I cannot be of opinion that <hi>the ordinary practise of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing by dipping the whole body in cold or warme water openly or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly is either a breacb of the sixth or seventh Commandment,</hi> unless he condemne Christ and his Apostles as appointing and practising a rite contrary to Gods commands, and be of an opinion, which is refuted by frequent experience of aged weak persons men and women baptized in cold stormy times in the open aire in cold running water without detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their health to mine one knowledge. Neverthelesse were it that any person did conceive, that he ought to be baptized <hi>naked, as vossius Thes. Theol.</hi> and <hi>Hist. disp.</hi> 1. <hi>de baptismo thesi</hi> 6. 7. 8. shewes in the first ages men women and Infants were, yet he may find there how provision was made against immodesty and murder, &amp; I wonder that either Mr. <hi>B.</hi> or any other considerate man that knows how persons go into bathes frequently, should imagine so evil of a persons going into the water but once in course habit in a penitent form not without grave company, not staying a minute in the water, that it could not be performed without such danger as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would possesse people with, in the second part of his book chap. 12. 13. His satyrical I had almost said scurrilous quips I let passe. I did not charge Mr. <hi>B.</hi> with endeavours <hi>to drive me or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of the land, or destroy us,</hi> but I think the instigators to the ordinance against Heresies, have had such minds. And whereas he saith page 247. <hi>I tell him of his danger</hi> and elsewhere that <hi>I threaten him,</hi> is a suggestion that I cannot yet ghesse whence it should arise. The cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of his book sect. 3. of my Antidote was to shew M. <hi>B.</hi> para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrased <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, to like purpose as I do. That the untruths he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44370:51"/>
chargeth me with page 248. 252. were not such is shewed before. The matter of the fourth, fift, sixt, and seventh sections being argumentative, is to be referred to the first part of his book. Page 257. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> applies that to one term of calling some Sects which I said of the rest of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, especially <hi>the accusation of societies proving wicked,</hi> that it hath a manifest tincture of reviling. He chargeth my <hi>conscience as having a flaw for insinuating that he called all Independents a Sect, and that for denying the power of a Synod to excommunicate, whereas he plainly limited his speech to that Independency which gives the people to govern by vote, which is the same with separatism.</hi> To which I reply, I took it, and do still, that in the books of Independents it is their received tenet, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating however it be not without officers, yet is in the people, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. but that whence they are named Independents by Mr. <hi>Her'le</hi> and others, is from denying superiority of Synods in governing, and appeales to them, and if a Sect then from thence as their distinguishing tenet. However for the tenet <hi>of the peoples governing by vote,</hi> I know no reason why they should be called a Sect rather then their opposites. The excommunication which the Scripture speaks, of so farre as I discern, is no where made a part of government, or of the Elders office any more then the Peoples. In antiquity it's apparant out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> &amp;c. that the people had a great hand in Elections, Excommunications, Absolutions. Nor is a person a Separatist for that tenet, but for dividing practises: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things in that section are answered before; To that page 259. of my logick, I say he is mistaken in it. I know this water to be cold because I feel its coldnesse, this person to be a false teacher because I hear from him false doctrine. The subject is not the <hi>suppositum</hi> as a substance but as a substance with its adjunct. I prove not a wall to be a wall by its whitenesse seen, but a white wall, and this is not <hi>idem per idem.</hi> The Apostle shews the evil lives of Hereticks for better prevention of their practises, not to prove them Hereticks <hi>[A ravening wolfe]</hi> signifies nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther error of doctrine, nor visiousnesse of life, but the effect or end of the persons described, to wit, destroying souls, often also lives and estates. That the <hi>false Prophets have sheepes clothing,</hi> that is, fair shews, though <hi>inwardly are ravening wolves,</hi> overthrows Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> interpretation he pleades so much for, except he think they can have <hi>sheeps clothing,</hi> that is fair shewes of a good life, who are openly wicked, so as <hi>by the fruits of their wickedness</hi> they may be known, which me thinks comes near a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> often sayes, he <hi>takes me not to be an Heretick nor a meer Anabaptist except they divide the Church.</hi> But he taking me
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44370:52"/>
for a divider of the Church, for my error must of necessity take me for an Heretick if he stand to the descriptions he there saith he likes, so that I cannot nor any Anabaptist or Independent long look to be out of his black roll of Hereticks. Page 260. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> saith, <hi>I make his questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an affirmation,</hi> and so doth he himself that tells us it speaks <hi>what a rarity it is according to his reading that any society of Anabaptists hath not proved wicked.</hi> But I make it <hi>a peremptory determination, where as it is neither omnino dubitantis, nor yet determinantis, but provo cantis.</hi> Nor did I say it was a most peremptory determination, but, <hi>no man will I think take his interrogation for any other then a most peremptory deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> which I think is true, the words carrying a plain shew of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory determination, and being written to the people of <hi>Kederminster</hi> were not likely to be a provocation of Anabaptists to look over their own intelligence, but a resolute assurance, that there hath not been known a society of Anabaptists since the world first knew them, that proved not wicked. And therefore I put no false sense on his words, as he falsely chargeth me, nor do I as he saith, <hi>call him dog,</hi> I onely say, like a right-English mastive he flies in the face, &amp;c. not comparing him to a dog, but his bold act to the manner of English mastives boldness, whereby he is no more called dog, then Christ is thief, when he saies, I come as a thief, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 3. To that which he saith page 261. <hi>of my cheat,</hi> I have answered. To his question, <hi>Did no body contradict Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism for so many hundred years? and yet is it an innovation.</hi> I answer yes: and I think Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will say of keeping an <hi>Easter, Lent-fast,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-communion, Monkish profession, Episcopacy, at least some of these are innovations not contradicted for so many hundred years. For his testimonies page 262, 263, 264. for the antiquity of Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, to the chiefest of them answer hath been made, that the eldest of them is not till the third age, that they onely urge it and practise it in case of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident danger of present death to save from perishing; that the conceit of peculiar privilege to Infants of believers is a late innovation: some of them are meerly impertinent without Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> vain infernece, some Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish rites of expiating Infants are unseeming Mr. <hi>B.</hi> to allege, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Satan. My testimonies page 264. of <hi>Bernard, Petrus Clunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censis, Eckbertus,</hi> are vindicated before, <hi>Strabo</hi> doth not say <hi>that afore Austins time, Infant-baptism was not,</hi> but onely, <hi>in the first times,</hi> nor is it likely that he did mistake <hi>Austins</hi> age 10 years. That the Copies put 25. for 35. Nor do I think he was mistaken in the reason of <hi>Austins</hi> deferring his Baptism, but that the reason he gives was one though not the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44370:52"/>
sole reason of it, and the testimony of <hi>Walafridus Strabo</hi> though later then <hi>Augustine,</hi> yet he giving himself to search out and to write of antient rites, is of more credit concerning the Antiquity of Infant-baptism then <hi>Augustines,</hi> who as I shew <hi>Apology.</hi> sect. 6. and elsewhere, did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inconsiderately call that an Apostolical tradition, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly observed in his dayes within the compass of his acquaintance. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians</hi> speech if it be rightly brought by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will prove all still-born Infants to be lost, being not of the visible Church Catholick. That which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> page 266. saith, <hi>fully satisfies him,</hi> part of it is false, the rest so frivolous, that I can impute his satisfaction to no other cause then his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerateness. The very same or like plea will serve for communion of young children in which yet Mr. <hi>B.</hi> is not satisfied. But to me it is very good satisfaction that baptizing of Infants is but an innovation, neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with the institution of Christ, nor the Apostles practise, nor known till it began to be conceived necessary to give grace and to save from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, yet then disswaded and not practised but in case of iminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death, nor maintained on any other ground till <hi>Zuinglius</hi> his dayes. What the Churches of Anabaptists so called have done <hi>in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should so much <hi>lament,</hi> till I know what it is I take to be a Calumny. That Anabaptists have been in danger by the instigations of Preachers and writers it is a marvel to me, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> should not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, who can hardly be ignorant whence the ordinance against blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies and heresies came. That any <hi>of my Antagonists are turned out of house and home is unknown to me,</hi> surely not for non-conformity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptizing, most certain, that if any such thing hath been done it was never by my procurement, nor I think any of the Churches of Anabaptists. That which Mr. <hi>B.</hi> page 267. saies, that the <hi>same men that subscribe the Anabapiists confession have many of them written other kind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine elsewhere.</hi> I doubt whether it be true, I find him onely naming <hi>Paul Hobson</hi> page 147. and citing some passages of his, of which that which is most liable to exception Mr. <hi>B.</hi> himself gives us this excuse in his <hi>Saints evelasting rest</hi> part. 2. chap. 1. sect. 2. page 169. <hi>not understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they affirm and deny the same thing in several expressions:</hi> so that however his expressions be dangerous, yet it is probable he held not the <hi>Socinian</hi> opinion, which he contradicted in the subscription to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, but onely discovered his weakness. And yet Mr. <hi>B.</hi> I think is not ignorant, that so holy &amp; learned a man as M. <hi>Pemble</hi> near the beginning of his <hi>Vindicae gratiae</hi> hath a like conceit of <hi>Gods never hating the elect, but being reconciled from eternity,</hi> taking reconciliation for an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44370:53"/>
act in God: which as I imagine Mr. <hi>B.</hi> would excuse in Mr. <hi>Pemble,</hi> so might he with a like charity excuse the other in <hi>Paul Hobson.</hi> What he cites out of <hi>Cyprian</hi> I wish Mr. <hi>B.</hi> had Englished it, and that both Anabaptists and their opposites would learn it. Page 268. he saith if my book of <hi>scandals were read, men may perhaps receive a preservative from my own hand from the danger of my opinion,</hi> to which I say, I wish my book of <hi>Scandals</hi> were more read, nor do I fear that my doctrine will be the lesse embraced for reading it, if my interpretation of my own words justified even by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> be received, as I shew before. Page 269. he tells us <hi>the Levellers were Anabaptists,</hi> but I cannot yet learn of any of them he names except <hi>Den</hi> that was so: though I deny not but there might be sundry of them such, likely of the Free-willers disclaimed by the seven Churches in <hi>London,</hi> and that they were but few in comparri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the rest: by the Newes-books I gather the Levelling businesse was carried on by such as were in no gathered Church, but lived above ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. As for Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> dark criminations I can give no answer to them, unlesse I could plow with his heifer and find out his riddle: But my hope is those great instruments of God to break the enemies of those that are termed Sectaries, though Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> words seem to forebode and misdeem evil of them, will and do prove better then he discribes them, though I imagine they be not Anabaptists. Nor do I like Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> obscure satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal criminations, they having some shew of a malevolent mind. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Mr. <hi>B.</hi> may conceive of the danger of the Anabaptists way in other things, I am sure if they would keep themselves onely to this to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized upon profession of faith, they should be in a safe way, even in the way of Christ.</p>

Church, though the thing be so manifest, to wit, that the Christian Church was otherwise gathered then the Jewish, that I see nothing but meer wrangling in the questions Mr. <hi>B.</hi> propounds. And to his words page 279, 280. <hi>Sir, if you were my Father, I would tell you that when you say, Christ makes no one City, Countrey, Tribe, his Disciples, you speak most malignantly, and wickedly against the Kingdome and dignity of my Lord Jesus.</hi> I answer, I meet so often with Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> high charges, upon palpable mistakes and weak proofs, that I fear his misguided zeal or natural distemper hath brought him to an habit of ill-speaking. My words were not as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> sets them down, but thus <hi>[no one Countrey, or City, or Tribe together, were gathered by the Apostles or other Preachers into the Christian visible Church, but so many of all as the Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to call by his word and spirit]</hi> which hath neither wickedness nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancy against the Kingdome and dignity of the Lord Jesus; but a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest truth expressely taught in the Holy Scripture as congruous to the glory of God and the Lord Jesus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26, 27. 28, 29. <hi>Not many wise men, &amp;c. Ergo</hi> not the whole Nation, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>out of every Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Ergo</hi> not the whole Nation, as he did the Jewes in the Wilderness. The relations in the Gospel and Acts of the Apostles plainly prove it true, that by <hi>John Baptist,</hi> Christ, the 12. and 70. Disciples was no entire Nation, City, Countrey or Tribe gathered into the visible Church-christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but parts of them, and those fewer then the adversaries, who in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place were so numerous (when the Christians are counted at some few thousands) as that even at Jerusalem and elsewhere they prevailed to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse Christians by persecution. Nor do Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> questions prove, <hi>that into the Christian visible Church any one whole Countrey, City or Tribe, young or old, men and women, are gathered by the Apostles and other Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> did gather together the Jewish Nation, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. But saith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> 1. <hi>Hath he noi commanded to Disciple Nations?</hi> I answer, yes: <hi>to make Disciples of all Nations by Preaching the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to every Creature,</hi> as it is, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 15. but no where by civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to gather a whole City, Countrey or Tribe, and to draw them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a National or City Covenant together, old and young, but to offer Christ and to baptize so many as are willing to embrace him. 2. Saith Mr. <hi>B. Hath not the Father promised to give the Heathen or Nations for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession,</hi> Psal. 2. <hi>and that Nations shall serve him?</hi> Answ.

into Covenant all the Jewish Nation, but as the Apostle speaks <hi>by mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the Gospel,</hi> Rom. 15. 16. the Gentiles, that is believers among them, are an <hi>offering to God, glorifie God, ver.</hi> 9. <hi>praise him, trust in him,</hi> ver. 11, 12. so as it was foretold <hi>in Abraham all Nations should be blessed,</hi> which is expounded <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17, 18. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers of all other Nations as well as Jews. 3. <hi>And that the Kingdoms of the world shall become the Kingdomes of the Lord and his Christ?</hi> Ans. I reade those words <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 15. but I find the time of fulfilling to be when the seventh Angel hath founded, which some say is not till the world to come. So Mr. <hi>Seager of the world to come,</hi> part. 1. sect. 8. And this is not improbable from ver. 18. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 10. 6, 7. <hi>The New Annot,</hi> faith thus, <hi>Antichrist is weakened, and Christ hath begun to take the Kingdome out of his hand, and shall have a visible Church like an Empire in all the known world, and that to the end, but that it is not yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 4. <hi>And do you not see it fulfilled before your eyes? Are not</hi> Bewdley, Kederminster, <hi>&amp;c. and</hi> England <hi>(till of late) as fully Christs Disciple, and so Church-members, as the Jews were in Covenant with God, and so Church-members?</hi> Answ. If by <hi>[it]</hi> be meant the prophecies <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 8. and 72. 11. I see them fulfilled, though not in Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> sense: but the prophecie <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 15. I see not yet fulfilled. I see at <hi>Bewdley, Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derminster, in England,</hi> people who generally are called Christians, but I do not see that all, old and young, are Disciples or Church-members, or ought to be so accounted, or that they were ever brought into such a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as the Jews, or-ought to be accounted. Church-members by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of such a Covenant. There is not a word in my writings to that effect. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> chargeth me <hi>[that I would not have Princes and Masters do what</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Moses <hi>did, in bringing the people of Israel into 'Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God]</hi> but I say, that should they do so, yet the Infants are not thereby to be accounted visible Church-members in a Christian Church. The commission to gather the Christian Church was not given to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, but Apostles. The Apostles, it is true, were sent to proselyte them that were no Chuch-members, and yet. they were sent to proselyte, or in the phrase of Scripture to Disciple, the visible Church-members of the Jewish Church as well as the Gentiles. What I said, I still say, that the different Church-call of the Jewish and Christian Churches is enough to shew a different Church-state, and consequently the argument is not good from the Jewish Infants visible Church-membership to ours. If Mr. <hi>Bs.</hi> judgement be <hi>not so commandable,</hi> as to assent to what I say, it is so much the <hi>lesse commendable.</hi> The speech of Mr. <hi>Herle,</hi> and the jest out of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44370:54"/>
                  <hi>Matthiolus</hi> are misapplied. When he saith, <hi>why may we not write plainly against one anothers judgement by a loving consent?</hi> He may know that it was my desire it should have been so, that it was not so, was from himself. He that believes he hath <hi>shewed love</hi> in this his writing, is very credulous. For the rest, if Mr. <hi>B.</hi> will have the patience and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of judgement which is meet, he may see an answer to his allegations about Gods mercy to Infants, and the repeal of their visible Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. If he remain in his opinion (which I much fear, knowing him so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as I do) and I in mine, we must leave our writings to others to judge, &amp; especially to that <hi>day which shall declare every mans work being revealed in fire.</hi> In the mean time (sleighting his vain curse, which is page 217.) my prayer for him as my self is, that we <hi>may do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</hi>

               <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and the other Collegues which in the <hi>Council</hi> were present, to the number of <hi>66.</hi> to brother <hi>Fidus</hi> greeting.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MOst dear brother,</hi> we have read thy letters, in which thou hast sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified concerning one <hi>Victor</hi> a Presbyter, that <hi>Therapius</hi> our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue <hi>in a time not ripe, and with overmuch haste, hath granted him peace, before he had done full penance, and satisfied the Lord God, against whom he had offended.</hi> Which thing hath enough moved us, that he hath departed from the authority of our Decree, that before the allowed and full time of fatisfaction, and without the asking and privity of the common sort, no infirmity urging, nor necessity compelling, peace should be granted to him. But upon counsel weighed long with us, it was enough to chide <hi>Therapius</hi> our Collegue in that he rashly did this; and to have instructed him; that for hereafter he do no such thing. Yet we have not thought, that the peace however once granted by a Priest of God should be taken away; and for this cause we have permitted <hi>Victor</hi> to use the Communication granted to him. But for what belongeth to the <hi>cause of Infants, whom thou hast said should not be baptized within the second or third day in which they were born; and that the law of antient Circumcision is to be considered, so as that</hi> thou shouldest not think <hi>him that is born should be baptized and hallowed within the 8. day;</hi> it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44370:55"/>
farre otherwise to all in our Council. For unto this which thou thoughtest should be done, none of us have agreed, but all have rather judged <hi>that the mercy and grace of God is to be denied to none that are born of mankind.</hi> For when the Lord in his Gospel saith, <hi>The son of man came not to destroy mens souls, but to save them,</hi> as much as in us lies if it may be, no soul is to be lost. For what is wanting to him, who is once formed in the wombe by the hand of God? For to us and in our eyes they which are born do seem to receive growth according to the course of secular dayes: but what ever things are made by God are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the Majesty and work of God the Maker. Lastly, the faith of Divine Scripture declares to us, that <hi>there is one evenness of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine gift to all, whether Infanrs or elder in age. When</hi> Helisaeus upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant son of the <hi>Shunamite widow</hi> which lay dead so laid himself when he prayed to God, that head was applied to head, &amp; face to face, &amp; the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Helisaeus</hi> spread over were joyned to each of the members of the little one, and the feet to its feet; Which thing if it be thought on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality of our birth and body, an Infant cannot be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to a person grown and come to full stature, neither could he close and fit little members to greater: But their Divine and Spiritual evenness is expressed, that all men are even and equal when they are made By God, and our age may have difference in increase of bodies according to the world, not according to God: unless if the grace also which is given to the baptized be given lesse or more according to the age of receivers: where as the holy Spirit is equally given to all, not by measure, but out of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and fatherly indulgence. For God as he accepts not a person, so neither doth he accept of age, sith he affordes himself alike to all with a ballanced equality for the obtaining of heavenly Grace. And for what thou hast said the footstep of an Infant made in the first dayes of his birth is not clean, because every one of us as yet is afraid to kiss him, neither do we think this to be a hindrance to the giving of heavenly Grace: for it is written, all things are clean to the clean; neither ought any one to be afraid to do that which God hath vouchsafed. For although the Infant is yet new from the birth, yet it is not so that one in giving grace and granting peace ought to be afraid to kiss him, sith in the kiss of an Infant every one of us according to his religion ought to think of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hands of God as yet fresh, which we in some: sort kiss in man now form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and newly born, when we embrance that which God hath made. For as for what was observed in Jewish carnal Circumcision the 8. day, is a Sacrament foregoing in a shadow and in an image, but is now compleat
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44370:55"/>
in the truth, Christ being come. For because the day in which the Lord should rise and quicken and give us Spiritual Circumcision was the 8. day, that is, the first after the Sabbath, this 8. day, that is, the first after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Sabbath and the Lords day went before in an image, which image ceased, the truth after <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ing upon it, and the Spiritual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision being given us. For which reason we think none ought to be hindred from obtaining the grace of Christ, nor that the Spiritual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision ought to be hindred by the carnal, but that every man altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be admitted to the grace of Christ, sith <hi>Peter</hi> also speaks and sayes in the Acts of the Apostles, The Lord hath said to me, none is to be said to be common and unclean. But if any thing might hinder men from the obtaining grace, more grievous sins might hinder grown men and commen to full stature &amp; elder in birth. But moreover, if to most grievous offenders, and those that sin much before God, when after they believe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins is given, and no man is withheld from Baptism and from grace, how much more ought not an Infant to be withheld, who being new born hath sins no whit, but that being born according to <hi>Adam</hi> carnally he drew on him in his first nativity the contagion of death of old: who in this respect doth more easily come to receive remission of sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause not his own sias but anothers are forgiven him? And therefore most dear brother, this was our sentence in the Council, that none by us ought to be prohibited from Baptism, and the grace of God, who is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifult and kind and tender to all. Which as it is to be observed and held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Infants themselves and newly born, who in this respect do deserve more of our help and 'Divine mercy, because in the first beginning their birth presently crying and weeping they do nothing else but pra We wish to thee most dear brother alwayes health.</p>

            <p>Sir, some of my neighbours conceived it would be their best way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve their doubts about Baptism to know what arguments you could bring for Infant-baptism, and against their being baptized, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pretended Baptism they had in Infancy.

And howsoever you conceive of my advantages, you may if you will, and perhaps do know, that you have such advantages in your ready wit and speech, and the favour and general acclamation to any thing that is said for the superstition of Infant-baptism as to bring things so to passe, that the event shall be crying down truth and disgrace of my person. Nor have your disparaging speeches of my writings without animadversions on them communicated to me, or your carriage at or not long after the receipt of my letter, encouraged me to hope for all candour from you in this matter.
