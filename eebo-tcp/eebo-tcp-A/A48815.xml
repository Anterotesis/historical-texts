            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nay, you are within a little of leaving no Churches to which you might be kind. For what is a Church without Authority?

               <p>The contrary Doctrine never wants maintainers, when there is occasion; neither are they the less numerous, or the less considerable, for making the less noise: whereof the reason is the eagerness with which the Pope espouses an opinion so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to him, which hinders us from being willing to do any thing which we think he would take ill. And so we let people talk as they please, till there be a necessity of declaring plainly what we think. And then it plainly appears that the sence of the world is very different from the thoughts of those writers how much soever they be cryed up. Neither are the maintainers even among writers so few, as you imagine. I am sure in our Nation there have been more Catholick Writers against it than for it. Thirteen eminent men subscribed a loyal profession to Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> even alter the Bull of <hi>Pius</hi> the 5th. came o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when <hi>Campian, Sherwin,</hi> and some others gave evasions instead of answers to the Questions, about the Power of the Pope and Queen, one <hi>Iohn Bishop,</hi> a man devoted to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> (says Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi>) wrote against them, and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved that that constitution of the <hi>Lateran Council</hi> obtruded under that name, upon which the whole authority of absolving Subjects from their Allegiance, and deposing Princes is founded, is no other, than a Decree of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3d. and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver admitted in <hi>England.</hi> Yea that the said Council was no Council at all, nor was any thing at all there decreed by the Fathers.</p>

               <p>I know not what credit I have to persuade you, but I tell you nothing but what I certainly know. Pray cast your eye a while on our Neighbors the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> no Fools in matters of Government. They make a shift to allarm us with fears of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, which being an odious thing, they think proper to cause jealousie among us, and serve their ends; but their actions manifest that they believe nothing less. They have a greater number of Papists than we have. They are a considerable part of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, equal if not superior to any one party. Whatever the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> say to amuze us, they are so far from being disquieted with fears of Popery themselves, that they take the very Priests into the protection of the Magistrate, and give the rest a comfortable indulgence: not out of carelessness, but because they are secure. For while the Papists have no pinching dissatisfactions to make them wish to change, they see well enough that they will not think of embroiling things, and upon uncertain hopes of a condition which cannot be much happier than the present, hazard to make themselves very unhappy by losing the present. So that till the Papists can convert the whole Nation one by one, the States see their Religion will never be in other terms than it is, and that is so unlikely, that she never has the least suspicion of it. For this desire to make Proselytes, which is common to all as well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Experience shews the progres of either side is inconsiderable, and the benefit to the State very much. The Papists upon many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions having been found as faithful to the State, as any of their fellow Subjects. Even at this time, while they have War with a powerful Enemy of that Religion, and who has lodg'd a powerful Army in the bowels of their Countrey, they find the Papists as fast to the interest of the State, as the best, and as earnest oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of a Forreign Power, though likely to introduce their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if it should prevail.</p>

They allways examine it themselves, and if they think it conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they receive it, and that reception makes it binding; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, no man regards it, or thinks himself obliged by it, and perhaps would be punished if he should. The Discourser menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the Canon Law, which here we our selves do not wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and when we do, must undo Doctors-Commons. Now I understand not that the Cannon Law is obliging farther than it is received, or that any Country is obliged to receive it, farther


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93523:11"/>
then as they find it for their convenience. Every Nation is at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do what appears best for themselves And therefore we see what is binding in one place, signifies nothing in another. And since <hi>England</hi> is now free from the Cannon Law, more than she finds for her benefit, assure your selves Papists would be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to part with that freedom as Protestants. We love not to thrust our necks into Yokes more than other people. I think in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if any decrees for the advantage of our Country were sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> we should not refuse a benefit, meerly because it came from thence. But we do not believe that what comes from thence, is obliging purely because it comes from thence; but only, when after due examination, by due authority at home, it is by that authority made obliging. And this holds, not only in decrees of Popes, but of Councels too, though never so general. Nations admit them as they like them, and so either receive all, or part, or none. Every body knows that no inducements have yet been able to prevail with the <hi>French</hi> to receive such Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> as concern manners. For which reason no man there is obliged to these decrees or any such, but where they will oblige themselves.</p>

               <p>What you say is really considerable. But I fear it does not quite do the Business. There is a great difference betwixt Laymen, and Clergimen. The Layety may be well enough affected to the peace of their Country, to which they give their Wifes and Children for Pledges; but the Clergy have no such hostages to give, and besides are so tyed by Education, and, if they aim at any preferment that is considerable, by Oath to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> that we cannever be secure of them. Shall I deal freely with you, and tell you an unwelcome truth? 'Tis for the Clergies sake, that we are the more jealous of you all. We could believe the Laiety honest enough. But considering the influence the Clergy has o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them both by the respect which you bear them, and by the ty of Confession, by which they are enabled to do even what they please, we can never be secure of one, unless we were secure of both. Now for your Regular Clergy, your self acknowledges the immediate dependance they have on the Pope by means of their exemptions. But we know besides, that all particulars vow obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Superiors; which obedience passes for the greater


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93523:11"/>
vertue and more sublime perfection by how much the more blind it is. These Superiors are subject to one another, till all comes at last to the General, to whom the whole Order is absolutely subject. This General both lives at <hi>Rome,</hi> and is many ways sure enough to the Pope. So that if any one of the whole Order dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please him, the General presently takes his part, and enforces the obedience vow'd to himself, to whatever the Pope desires. And as we see in reason this must needs happen, so we find by experience that it does; as in the case of <hi>Walsh, Withrington,</hi> and others. Your secular Clergy, as you call them, indeed have not the same dependance, and were they left to their native liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might do well enough. But the Pope has found out an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to bring them to his bow, and requires such an Oath both from Bishops and other Dignitaries, that those who take it must needs be more his Subjects than their own Princes. Wherefore pray consider whether we can in any reason have a confidence in men who, though they be well disposed themselves, are govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by such as we know are tyed to the Popes interest.</p>

               <p>The more I should think it is for your interest to allow us such as are of good Principles, and of whose fidelity and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the interest of their Country you might be assured. You know as well as we that, we cannot be without Priests, and that whatever hazard we undergo, whether of estate or life, we must have some. So that unless you banish or hang us all up without more ado, while there is a Papist in <hi>England,</hi> there will be a Priest. Now while you hinder us from having men brought up in such principles as might be free from jealousie, 'tis not possible for us to do otherwise than we do: for we are forc'd to take such as we can get; and if they prove otherwise principl'd than you would have them, the fault is none of ours. As for the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that vow of obedience which Religious take, reaches no farther then to the better performance of the duties of that kind of life which they have chosen, and is so understood, and not otherwise, by those among them who are understanding. And if you apprehend any danger in it 'tis very easie to make provision against it.

there is not on one (at least Lay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) Catholick in ten thousand that ever heard of it. I will not question the truth of what you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ay, because I do not mistrust you; and besides 'tis an easie matter when I can meet with a Pontifical to see what is there. But I must still remain of my former opinion, that 'tis not generally in use, though perhaps it may be in the Popes own territories. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pontifical is no proof as to that point. For other countreys have their Pontificals and Liturgies of their own fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and that may be in the Roman Pontifical which perhaps is no where else. That 'tis of no ancient standing, is clear by the Oath it self, which mentions the Congregation of the Sacred Council, and every body knows that that Congregation was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted since the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>; and every body knows too tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be 'tis a clear case that being made by the Pope none can be more obliged to take it, than to receive his other Decrees, which as we have discourst already, no Nation is oblig'd to do, but by free consent, as far as they find them beneficial to themselves. Wherefore as I said before, allow us Ecclesiastical Ministers, of whose fidelity you may be assured, and we will be careful enough, you may be sure not to run rashly and ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Recourse, which is now had to him, I believe was occasioned by the frequent abuses which happened in promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and which is thought so far from necessary even now, that, if I mistake not, the Canons are still in force, which order that unless he provide for a vacant Sea, within a time limited, and that no long one, the three next Bishops shall make one without more ado. However this collation of Bishopricks by the Pope, is plainly by Canon Law, and subject to the contingencies and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of other Canons.</p>

               <p>I cannot tell what the design of the Author was. 'Tis in the number of unknowable secrets, and we ought still to judge favourably of things we know not. But his Book seems apt to stir animosities, which if he judge seasonable, <hi>I</hi> should think not so charitable. Neither can I understand why the moderate share we had in the late Indulgence, should occasion so much Zeal against us, and none against others who were more largly

Which is all the Indulgence allow'd us. Sure tis no part of the goodness of your Church to hinder others from being as good as they can; and the worse our Religion is, the more need we have of praying to make us better. Again let the Pope claim what power he pleases, and that power be as inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient as that Gentleman pleases; private prayer will not therefore be inconvenient, or you receive any harm from what passes in private. Against seditious Doctrines, such as those are declared by Catholicks to be, I hope the Laws takes Order, and they are excepthd by the very declaration. 'Tis the name of Abby Lands and Vbby-Lubbers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the rest of the inconveniences he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; private prayer certainly will never pray them in, and were there any danger of them, we should help you to our powers to keep them out. His Topic of Auricular confession, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion might have been spared in respect to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which is far from disaproving such Confession. And however e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body must needs see that there are Nations, who use it, as careful of the honours, of their Families every jot as the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, and something more jealous.
