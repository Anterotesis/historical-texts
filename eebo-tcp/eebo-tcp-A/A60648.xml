            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39175:8"/>
And they Observe one Day in a Week for their Worship, and a few Hours in that Day to perform it; and they have an Hour-glass (many of them) and that is their time of Preaching; and their Eye will be oft towards the Glass, to see when it is Run, because it is a long Hour to them; and when the Glass is Run, they tell their People the time is now spent, or words to that purpose and what hath been spoken, that must suffice for that time; and this is not the Practice of Christs Ministers.</p>

               <p>The true Ministers of Christ, have their Power and Authority in God, and that is their Foundation; they take no Tythes, nor Sue any People at Law for maintenance, nor cast any into Prison; they do not love filthy lucre, neither make their Belly their God; they Preach the Word faithfully, and do not limit the Holy One, either to Time, Place or Person; they are meek and gentle

               <p>Yes Child, there is so, even as much as is betwixt that which is true, and that which is false; or betwixt light and darkness: For the false Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are of the Earthly Wisdom, and the true Ministers are endued with Wisdom from above.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, the false can speak of the Name of Christ (as the true do) but they want his Power.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how may I then know which is true, and which is false by their words, seeing words may be the same?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Why, they that are false, Preach Christ without, and bid People believe in Him, as he is in Heaven above; but they that are
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39175:9"/>
true Ministers they Preach Christ within, and direct People to wait to feel him in themselves, and so to believe in him, as he makes himself manifest in them; and this is true Doctrine that brings people to mind that Principle of God in their own Consciences, which comes down from Heaven, and goes thither again; and such as are in the Earthly Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, they do not know Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>This is a great difference in their Doctrine, for one to preach Christ</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, <hi>and another preacheth him</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, it doth make a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and hath no more fellowship together, than the East hath with the West.</p>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and it vvill not deceive thee, but vvill certainly give thee an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39175:10"/>
understanding, vvhereby thou maist discern them both; and if thou wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in the measure of the Light of Christ, thou wilt be able to try all things, and so come to chuse that vvhich is good.</p>

               <p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, for the Scriptures vvere given forth from the Spirt, and it is the Spirit that tryes vvhether the things be true or false, good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>The Scriptures are a true Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of vvhat the Saints were made vvitnesses of; but the Spirit is the Rule from which the Scriptures were given forth; and it vvas the Rule un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that gave forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and they had the Spirit before they spake the Words; and they spake the words as the Spirit moved,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39175:10"/>
so that the Spirit was before the Words, and was their Rule that spake the Words, and it changes not, but is the same for ever.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is the service of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures if they be not a Rule, and for try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al af things that are spoken?</hi>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>They are of great service, child, and are to be read and believed; and they become comfortable, when in the same Spirit that gave them forth, they are fufilled, and truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Scriptures are to be owned and believed, as a true Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of what the Saints were made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of in that day.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, they are to be owned and believed, and they that do not so, they are to be denied: but thou must take heed, child, of giving more unto the Scriptures than unto them belongs, least in so doing thou di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish from the glory of Christ, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39175:11"/>
so give it to another. And if thou look'st upon the Scripture to be for a Rule, and for trying, thou givest that unto them which belongs unto Christ, for he is the Rule, and leads his people, and he alone searches the heart, and tryes the reins, and not the Scriptures.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how then must Spirits be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if not by the Scriptures? Must one Spirit try another?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>The Spirit of God must try all spirits; for it knows the spirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of God, and if not, it discerns them, and judgeth infallibly of them; and if they be of God, it receives them, and embraces them with joy; and this is not the spirit of a man, to try the spirit of a Man, but the Spirit of God that tryes all mens spirits.</p>

               <speaker>C.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then I perceive it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit alone that I am to mind in all things.</hi>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, child, for by minding of the Spirit alone in all things, thou wilt come to a good understanding in all things, and be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and put a difference betwixt that which is true, and that which is false.</p>

               <p>That which discovers to thee the body of corruption, that is the Light of Christ: and when thou first seest thy self in it, thou canst see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but corruption standing; but by obeying, and believing in it, thou

               <p>Yes, child, that is the light of Christ, and with it are they all made manifest, and thou canst not hide any thing from it; when thou art in secret, it is with thee, and there shews thee what thy thoughts are, it sorts thy words and deeds, and lets thee see whether they bee good or evil: if thy Thoughts be after vanity, it discovers them, and reproves thee in thy own Conscience for them; and thy thoughts thou canst not hide from it; if thou speakest vain words, or dost any evil deeds, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns thee in thy self, and thou canst not fly from the Judgement of it; and this is the pure Light of

               <p>Why that is the Light of Christ that lets thee see all that ever thou hast done, and also what is present with thee, and what thy life is in; and what thy love is after: And if thou mindest, thou wilt see what ever riseth out of the darkness, and what the Prince of Darkness tempts thee to do; so that thou wilt find that the Light of Christ will make manifest every evil in the appearance of it, and will call thee to abstain from it; and if thou obeyst, it will keep thee from joyning to it. And I shall in

               <p>It is very dangerous, child, and it is the way of the old Serpent, and such a Profession never makes a Christian, nor brings forth a pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but forms up a shew of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness out of the Power.</p>

               <p>Nay, their Doctrine is after the Tradition of men, and not after Christ; and they get their Doctrine by their Arts and Languages that they have learned at Schools and Colledges, and then read it, or speak it forth in their own wills that are corrupted, and there is no soundness in it.</p>

               <p>Why child, they that seek Honour one of another, they do not believe in Christ, the power of God, which is honourable in all men, and is to be honoured where it appears in any; and this seeks not the honour <hi>below,</hi> or to have the <hi>Hat</hi> put off, or the <hi>Body</hi> to <hi>bow</hi> and <hi>cringe,</hi> or the <hi>feet</hi> to <hi>scrape</hi>; it neither seeks such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor can give such honour; for it is a beggarly honour when it is compared with that honour that comes from God alone, and where it is sought and expected it is from below; and that which answers the Expectation is the same: and so men seek honour one of another, and they give it one to another with their <hi>Hat</hi> and <hi>Kee,</hi> And, <hi>Your humble Servant Sir:</hi> And such are not in the power of God, but in the vain customs of the <hi>Heathen</hi>; and so it is got in a

Custom to put of the <hi>Hat,</hi> and <hi>bow,</hi> and <hi>cringe,</hi> and <hi>scrape</hi>; and Women to <hi>Curtisie</hi> and <hi>Droop</hi>; And this is sought for and expected one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and they receive it one of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: And these are the Apostate Christians, that are out of the Power of God that is Honourable, and so seek honour one of another, and are respecting one anothers Person; and the Rich and the Proud they get the Honour; and the Poor and the Needy they are not regarded.</p>

               <p>Nay Child, such Honour doth not belong to them, neither are they Honoured when in is done so unto them; for <hi>true Honour</hi> is from the <hi>Heart,</hi> and not from the <hi>Hat</hi>: And where any thing of God appears in Magistrates and Men in Authority, that is Honoured with the <hi>Heart,</hi> and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:39175:27"/>
it doth not expect the <hi>Hat</hi>: And this is true Honour, Child, and it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto whom it is due.</p>

               <p>Thou must be careful, Child, how thou Reason'st about it, lest thou run'st into Transgession; for if thou respect'st Persons, thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittest sin, and the Law of God will convince thee of Trangression: Therefore mind the Lord and his Teachings; and if men be offended because thou obey'st the Lord, thou wilt not be guilty of the offence; but the Wo shall be unto that in them which would be Honoured with thy <hi>Hat,</hi> from whence the offence comes.</p>

               <speaker>F.</speaker>
               <p>Nay: The Lord requires it not, but the pride of man's Heart seeks it; for the Lord requires that thou shouldest Honour all men in him; and that is, to give <hi>Honour</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom <hi>it is due</hi>; but unto a <hi>proud, heady, high-minded Man,</hi> there, is no <hi>Honour due,</hi> though he may be great in the World, and be in Place to Rule; but in the Power of God the Pooor is as Honourable as the Rich, and the Beggar as he that Rules; and the Honour is given as due unto the Power, and not unto any man's Person.</p>

all that have been guided by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God without respect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; And we do not read of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was spoken by the Holy men of God unto any person, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a King, or any in Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him; for the Spirit of Truth leads into all Truth, and <hi>Thou</hi> to <hi>One</hi> is the Language of Truth <hi>without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</hi> and the Spirit of Truth teaches to speak it, and not another.</p>

               <p>Yes, When thou hast occasion to speak <hi>to One</hi>; And do not respect the Person of any Man or Woman; for it is as true to the Rich as to the Poor; and the Spirit of Truth will teach thee to speak it if thou mindest and obeyest it; and if thou dost not, it will reprove thee.</p>

               <p>Whatever men require of thee, Child, thou must mind what the Lord requires of thee; and if men require that of thee which the Lord forbids thee, thou must obey God: And Christ Jesus hath forbidden all Oathes, and it is not lawful to <hi>Swear</hi> upon any account, though men may require it; because Christ hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>not to Swear at all</hi>: and if thou lovest him, thou wilt keep his Commandments, and not Transgress against him, because men require thee to do otherwise; but do thou mind the Spirit of Truth, and it will teach thee to speak truth in what thou art called unto, and thy <hi>Yea</hi> in the Truth, will bind thee to perform faithfully what thou Testifieth or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth to: And so in all things thou art called unto, speak the truth from thy Heart, as in the sight of God,

               <p>They that bring Scriptures to plead for <hi>Swearing</hi> in this day, they do not understand the Scriptures; for He who is Lord of all, saith, <hi>Swear not at all, neither by Heaven nor by Earth, nor by any other thing; but let your</hi> Yea <hi>be</hi> Yea, <hi>and your</hi> Nay Nay, <hi>for what is more comes of Evil</hi>: And thou art to obey Jesus Christ whose Doctrin is true, and who ends the Dispensation of Oaths where strife was; and in that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, when they did <hi>Swear,</hi> and were not to forswear themselves, it was not an Oath formed in words,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:39175:31"/>
and then imposed by the laying a hand upon the <hi>Bible,</hi> and <hi>kising it,</hi> but was solemnly spoken from their own mouths, and what proceeded out of their mouths, that they were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto the Lord; And this was the Oath commanded in that Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, as thou mayest read, <hi>Num.</hi> 30. <hi>If a man vow a Vow unto the Lord, or Swear an Oath to bind his Soul with a Bond, he shall not break his word, he shal do according to al that proceedeth out of his mouth:</hi> (now Mark Child) This was the thing the Lord Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in that Dispensation, and it was no more but the word that was to proceed out of their own mouths, and were not to break, because it was the Soul's bond; therefore they were to do according to all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded out of their mouths; so that it was to proceed out of their own mouths, and not to be imposed in formed words, which binds not the

Soul: And there is no Scripture that mentions any other way of <hi>Swearing</hi> in that Dispensation; but now Christ Jesus, who Ends all the Changeable things, He saith, <hi>Swear not at all; but let your Yea be Yea</hi>; And it is without Exception, or putting any difference betwixt <hi>vain Oaths,</hi> and <hi>solemne Oaths</hi>: He saith, <hi>Not at all,</hi> nor <hi>by any thing</hi>; For, what is more than <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> comes of <hi>Evil</hi>: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Child, obey thou Christ's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, what ever men may Require of thee; and if thy <hi>Yea</hi> will not be taken to the Truth of thy word, let nothing else be done by thee, lest thou fall'st into Condemnation.</p>

            <p>NOw is Salvation come from the most High, and the God of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> is over all; he is confounding the Wise men in their Wisdom, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the strong men in their strength, he is breaking the Idols of silver, and the Idols of gold, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

carved work he is throwing down, and his eye beholds the way of every man, and he sees their work of what sort it is; he is the searcher of the heart, and he passeth by and beholds the intents thereof; hidden things he brings to light, and by the gift of his own Spirit he shews to every man his thoughts, this is his perfect gift to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, a manifestation thereof all men have, that they thereby might profit; and though a measure of this Spirit hath a being <hi>in All,</hi> and makes its self manifest <hi>in all,</hi> and is the true light that doth enlighten <hi>all that come into the World,</hi> yet all do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, nor come to be guided by it so walk in the flesh, and cannot please God, neither can perceive the things of God, and what is performed by such as a <hi>Service</hi> or <hi>Worship</hi> to God, he doth not require it at their hands; and though they make many prayers he will not hear, for they have no U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

with his Spirit; and this tryes all people, and their works in a true <hi>Discerning,</hi> and gives true <hi>Judgment</hi> upon all according to their doings; and who have not this Spirit of Christ they are none of his; but all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and have Union with it, they walk not in the flesh, but in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in which they see the <hi>Shapes</hi> and <hi>Forms</hi> of every <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeness,</hi> and the ground from whence they do arise; and no false birth can have a hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-place, but from the least to the greatest they are discovered, and the fairest <hi>covering</hi> that any have cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves withal is seen through, and all the formed likenesses which appear this day amongst the sons of men in what they do profess of God, they are all seen to be of the flesh, and their <hi>Root</hi> and principle is of that part and nature that is earthly, from which no good thing can arise; and it brings forth a birth in its own likeness, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:39175:36"/>
of its own nature, which by the Spirit is truly discerned, and every work of the flesh is manifest to the Spirit, for the Spirit searcheth all things, &amp; truly judges all things, for the Spirit is truth: And though this may seem in many of your eyes to be rash judgment, and you may call it so, yet it will stand a witness against all that are satisfying the flesh. For there is not any thing so hardly received as that testimony that strikes at the life of another, and that which deals plainly and simply with all, and desires the good of all, that meets with the least entertainment in the hearts of people; but that which flatters, and cryes peace when the bonds of Iniquity stand, that is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thing unto the minds of all who walk in the flesh; and that which coms to rip them up, and discover their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness to their shame, that, they kick against, and will not own nor receive it for truth; for there is not any
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:39175:37"/>
people would come to shame for what they do; and that which opens secrets, and brings any thing to light, by which shame may come upon them, they turn against that and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, though the thing be really true which is witnessed against; and so there is no work of the flesh that would come under the spirits Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though it be truly discerned and judged as it is, and the Discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Judgment stand in the truth; but those concerned in it will not own it, but cry out, Who made you a Judge? And why are you so rash to judge, as if all were to be condemned but your selves? How do you know the hearts of people? And why may not others be as right as you for what you know? So every <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Likeness</hi> would save its own Life by putting off the Judgment, as if none could Discern it; and no false birth that would have its Nakedness to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:39175:37"/>
lest it should come to shame thereby: And thus People harden themselves against the Spirit's Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which in it self is the searcher and tryer of Hearts and Reins, and none can hide their Councel from it. (Mark) Is not this the Judge that stands at the door and knocks? Doth not he discern when Evil rises in your Hearts? And doth he not there Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove you?

And what Thought can you think (amongst all your Thoughts) that he doth not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern?

to the truth declared; and all that have received the Spirit, and are born of the Spirit, they have an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing given them, by which they are able to Discern the flesh, &amp; all the works of it, and give true Judgment upon it without respect of Persons; not judging according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit, and sees to the Root and principle from which all things spring up and grow; and they do not judge according to the outward appearance, but judge Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgement; for such as <hi>Discern</hi> no further than what outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and then judge according to that, Others from the same ground may draw as true a Judgment against them: And here, people are not to Judge, lest they be Judged; which is a place much alleadged against true Judgment; but whoso Judges one of another, it is not in the Spirit of Truth which doth Discern through
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:39175:38"/>
all Appearances; but it is in the flesh which cannot perceive beyond what doth appear: And so all the false Births give Judgement one against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and cannot bear the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one another; then they are provoked and angry one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and run into confusion and Distraction, Warring and Fighting, and Destroying one another about their formed Religion; none being come to the Spirit that gives a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning through what appears, and gives true Judgment in the ground: but all born of the Spirit have true Union with it, and the flesh and the deeds of it, are subdued under it; and they are no more in the flesh, but in the Spirit; and have received Christ Jesus the Lord, and walk in him, and are Spiritual, and the Spiritual man judgeth all things, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is judged of no man: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you can receive it or no, you are

all truly tryed and judged not in the flesh, but in the Spirit; and your <hi>ROOT</hi> and <hi>FOVNDATION</hi> is seen and Discerned, and is not found to be that which was in the beginning, but that which the Subtility generated since the beginning, and so doth he rule over you, and blind your minds, that you cannot see, nor discern fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than what appears; and the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Kingdom is hid from your eyes, and you run into the Words with your carnal Minds and earthly Wisdom, and from what is Written draw something to your selves, and form up a <hi>Likeness</hi> in your conceivings, and bring that forth in the strength of your own Wills; and this is your Foundation, and the first principle of your Religion; and so the <hi>HARLOT</hi> hath brought forth many children, which in her Womb have all been conceived, and yet are not formed one like another, but all

differ in their <hi>Shape</hi> and <hi>Likeness,</hi> and then strive one with another, and yet are all children of one House, and all of one Kingdom; but no Love, nor Unity found amongst them; but Envie, Hatred and Malice, and all one against another, and divided into Heads and Parties, which is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Testimony of the Ruine &amp; Fall of your House and Kingdom; For, <hi>A House divided against it self, cannot stand.</hi>

            <p n="3">3 Man thus considered in himself,

            <p n="4">4 When thy mind is thus turned to the light of Christ Jesus in thy own Conscience, and that thou begin to yield unto it, and to obey its testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, then in the light a holy thing is conceived, and by operation quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and being conceived and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the life, it breatheth and thirsteth after life, and the life doth nourish it by giving more life unto it, and so prepares it for the day of its bringing forth, which in fulness of time doth come to pass; and this is the birth which is born not of flesh, nor of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>

of God, for in that is life, and there thou wilt discern when any passion riseth, or any extream worketh, and when the life moves by operation, and raises thee up in the power of it self, and makes thee fresh and living with its own virtue, then yield thy self to be disposed by it, so will no false height ensnare thee, nor any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation entangle thee, but the life will preserve thee in it self, and lead thee in the feeling of the love in which is the true temperance, that gives do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all inordinate affection; and here thou wilt come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that it is God alone that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all thy works for thee, and so thou wilt be brought to cease from all thy own labour, and to wait upon God in a single dependency, to feel his movings, drawings and leadings, whereby thy way will be peace, and thy path pleasantness, and the Lord thy God will give thee the Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy in his own love, by which

thou wilt be comforted in thy travel, and be made strong to persevere unto the end, and then what thou hast seen afar off thou wilt come to inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and what thou hast breathed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou wilt come to enjoy, and so thou wilt know that the life which quickned thee, the same will satisfie thee in the lot of thy inheritance, for mercy and peace is unto thee who art subjected to the wil of God; and thus doth God alone bring to pass the councel of his heart for his seed sake; therefore let all flesh be silent, and keep in silence, for time is with the Lord, and his own time is the best time, who in time begins his work, in time prospers it, and in time perfects it and so in time quickning, in time nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, and in time bringing forth the birth of his life; and this can no man do for himself with all his own labor, therefore feel thou the Lord who art quickned by him, and cast all thy care upon him, for he careth for thee, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:39175:46"/>
in humility he will exalt thee, in wants he will supply thee, in poverty he will enrich thee, in nothingness he will fill thee, in distress he will comfort thee, and in his love and life he will give thee all things freely, and so in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, simplicity and uprightness in the seed of God thou wilt walk with God in the Paradice of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>Now learn a parable, the vine is a tender plant, and all extreams are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its nature; therefore in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it neither blossoms nor bears fruit, but the seed of its nature retires into its root, and there preserves it self in the extreamity of cold, and violent storm, but when the temperate Spring comes the seed assendeth, and fills every branch with its virtue, whereby the branches shoots and spreads abroad, and the grapes they multiply &amp; grow in clusters, and this comes to pass in the Spring time, when the Sons tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate heat breaks forth, and the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:39175:46"/>
Clouds moderate dew and showers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, even so is all born of God. So thou that art tender in the life, wait for thy growth in the same, and when the life moveth by its own power, do not quench it by reasoning, for though it work in its power, and may dispose thee by its power, yet is the moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, temperance, and pure wisdom in it, and all extreams of passion are subdued by it, and so thou sitting in the life, thou sits over all deadness, and also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all unruliness, and in the pure tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of the life, thou feelst Gods presence, his vertue and goodness, by which thou art made fresh and green and fruitful, and in that state the Lord hath pleasure in thee; so it is a weighty matter to understand the true place of temperance, for it lyes beyond the comprehension of the deepest reason in the fall, and through Faith is found in the life which reason cannot compass, for where it will it bloweth, and when it will it worketh, and by its working
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:39175:47"/>
enliveneth, and so by its motion dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the mind in the pure tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of its own nature and property, in which there is no contrariety by any composition, &amp; therfore the motion of the life cannot be truly called a passion or an extream, though it may dispose the mind contrary or beyond what the wisdom below can fathom or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>
            <p>So every Babe of life, hold fast that which in the life thou hast received, &amp; what thou mayest further see in the Prophesie unto which thou art not yet attained; wait in patience and let pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience have its perfect work in thee, and the life will draw thee and bring thee into its selfe in its own time, and what thou hast not yet seen, be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive to know, but live by Faith in the measure of the life which thou hast received, and unto which thou art at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and let not thy reason search into the secrets of God; and being sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:39175:47"/>
in the Faith unto God, and holding fast that which thou hast received in the life, and in the drawings of the life keep thy way; that which thou hast not yet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, God will give thee in his time, and what thou hast not yet seen God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it unto thee, and so by the life thou wilt be preserved in the feeling of the life that is present with thee, and in the vertue of it thou wilt grow from one degree to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and so in due time come to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and intire therein, and in thy place where thou art travelling in a measure of the life, thou wilt feel perfect union with God, and with all the Lambs and babes born of God in what degree soever they stand in the life, and thou wilt also feel u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with every motion of the life, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in babes, strong men or ancients, and the life will conform thee unto what is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by its own motion, and so thou wilt hold the true form in unity as from the life it is moved, observed, and practised, which being less or more it is but one in all, and doth perfectly agree in it self both in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:39175:48"/>
