            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Who by their meanes casting indeed but nets and chaines, and invisible bands about that person, whom most of all he pretendeth to serve, he shutteth up his Prince in a prison most sure, though sweet and senselesse.</p>

                  <p>This did all these in the Roman Empire, who rose from subjects to be great Princes, and to put downe Emperours.

and singular.

And then judge you whether her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty that now raigneth (whose life and prosperity, the Lord in mercy long preserve,) have not just cause to feare, in respect of these things onely; if there were no other particulars to prove his aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring intent besides?</p>

                  <p>I know not whether I doe expound or declare my self well or no; but my meaning is, that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as every Prince hath two points of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Considering then upon that which hath beene said and specified before, how that my Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> hath possessed himself of all the strength, powers and sinewes of the Realme, hath drawne all to his own direction, and hath made his party so strong, as it seemeth not resistable: you have great reason to say, that her Majesty may justly conceive some doubt, for that if his will were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his power, most assured it is, that her Majesty were not in safety.</p>

Which if you please to have the patience, to heare a Scholars argument, I will prove by a principle of our Philosophy.</p>

should please him. In which kinde, seeing my Lord of <hi>Leycester</hi> hath so much to encrease his feare, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath beene shewed by his wicked dealings: it is not like, that ever hee will put himselfe to another mans courtesie, for passing his audict in particular reckonings, which he can no way answer or satisfie: but rather will stand upon the grosse Sum, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Quietus est,</hi> by making himselfe chiefe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour, and Master of all accompts for his owne part in this life, howsoever he do in the next: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of such humours have little regard. And this is for the nature of ambition in it selfe.</p>
                  <p>The second argument may bee taken from my Lords particular disposition: which is such,<note place="margin">The second argument. <hi>Leycesters</hi> particular disposition.</note> as may give much light also to the matter in question: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a disposition so well liking and inclined to a Kingdome, as it hath beene tampering about the same, from the first day that hee came in favour.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Leycesters</hi> disposition to tamper for a Kingdome.</note> First, by seeking openly to marry with the Queenes Majestie her selfe, and so to draw the Crowne upon his owne head, and to his posterity. Secondly, when that attempt tooke not place, then hee gave it out, as hath beene shewed before, how that he was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily contracted to her Majesty, (wherein as I told you his dealing before for satisfaction of a stranger, so let him with shame and dishonour remember now also,<note place="margin">I meane the noble old Earle of <hi>Pembrooke.</hi>

                     </gap>hat his privy contract might be denied more easily, then he able justly to prove the same, after her Majesties decease: he had a new fetch to streng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hen the matter, and that was to cause these words of (<hi>Naturall issue</hi>) to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Statute of succession for the Crowne, against all order and custome of our Realme, and against the knowne common stile of Law, accustomed to bee used in Statutes of such matter: whereby hee might be able after the death of her Majesty, to make ligitimate to the Crowne any one bastard of his owne, by any of so many hacknies as he kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, affirming it to bee the <hi>Naturall issue</hi> of her Majesty by himselfe. For no other reason can bee imagined why the ancient usuall words of <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full issue</hi> should so cunningly bee changed into <hi>Naturall issue</hi>; thereby not onely to indanger our whole Realme with new quarrels of succession, but also to touch (as farre as in him lyeth) the Royall honour of his Soveraigne, who hath beene to him but too bountifull a Princesse.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when after a time these fetches and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices began to be discovered, he changed straight his course, and turned to the Papists and Scottish faction, pretending the marriage of the Queene in prison. But yet after this againe, finding therein not such successe as contented him throughly, and having in the meane space a new occasion offered of baite; he betooke himselfe fiftly to the party of <hi>Huntington:</hi> having therein (no doubt) as good meaning to himselfe, as his Father had by joyning with <hi>Suffolke.</hi> Marry yet of late, he hath cast anew about, once againe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And albeit in right title, and discent of bloud (as you say) hee can justly claime neither Kingdome nor Cottage (conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring either the basenesse or disloyalty of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours:) if in respect of his present state and power, and of his naturall pride, ambition, and crafty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, received from his Father, hee hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how to put himselfe first in possession of chiefe rule, under other pretences, and after to devise upon the title at his leasure.</p>
                  <p>But now to come to the third argument:<note place="margin">The third argument.</note> I say more, and above all this, that the nature and state of the matter it selfe, permitteth not,<note place="margin">The nature of the cause it selfe.</note> that my Lord of <hi>Leycester</hi> should meane sincerely, the Crowne for <hi>Huntington</hi>; especially seeing there hath passed betweene them so many yeares of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and enmity: which albeit, for the time and present commodity, bee covered and pressed downe: yet by reason and experience we know, that afterward when they shall deale together againe in matters of importance, and when jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie shall bee joyned to other circumstances of their actions, it is impossible that the former mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like should not breake out in farre higher degree, then ever before.</p>

                  <p>First,<note place="margin">The first reason.</note> it is common and a generall rule of our English lawes, that no rule, Ax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ever so generall) can touch or bind the Crown, except expresse mention bee made thereof in the same; for that the king and crowne have great priviledge and prerogative above the state and affaires of subjects, and great differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces allowed in points of law.</p>
                  <p>As for example,<note place="margin">The rule of thirds.</note> it is a generall &amp; common rule of law, that the wife after the decease of her hus<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>band,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56134:69"/>
shall enjoy the third of his lands: but yet the Queene shall not enjoy the third part of the Crowne, after the Kings death: as well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by experience, and is to be seene by law, <hi>Anno</hi> 5. and 21. of <hi>Edward</hi> the third;<note place="margin">Tenant by cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie.</note> and <hi>Anno</hi> 9. and 28. of <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt. Also it is a common rule, that the husband shall hold his wives lands after her death, as tenant by courtesie during his life, but yet it holdeth not in a Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, it is a generall and common rule, that if a man dye feased of Land in Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simple, having daughters and no sonne, his lands shall be divided by equall portions among his daughters,<note place="margin">Division among daughters.</note> which holdeth not in the Crowne: but rather the eldest Daughter inherite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h the whole, as if she were the issue male. So also it is a common rule of our law,<note place="margin">Executor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> that the executor shall have all the goods and chattels of the Testator, but not in the Crowne. And so in many other cases which might bee recited, it is evident that the Crowne hath priviledge above others, and cannot be subject to rule, be it never so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, except expresse mention be made thereof in the same law: as it is in the former place and a statute alledged: but rather to the contrary (as after shall be shewed) there is expresse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for the prerogative of such as descend of Royall bloud.</p>
                  <p>Their second reason is, for that the demand o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tance as is meant in the statute.</note> forbidding aliens to demand heritage within the allegiance of England: and that for two respects. The one, for that the Crowne it selfe cannot be called an heritage of allegiance, or within alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, for that it is holden of no superiour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, but immediately from God himselfe:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56134:69"/>
the second, for that this statute treateth onely and meaneth of inheritance by descent, as heyre to the same, (for I have shewed before that Aliens may hold lands by purchase within our Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and then say they,<note place="margin">The Crowne a corporation.</note> the Crowne is a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate, and descendeth not according to the common course of other private inheritances: but goeth by succession, as other incorporations doe. In signe whereof it is evident, that albeit the King be more favoured in all his doings, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny common person shall be, yet cannot hee avoyd by law his grants and letters patents by reason of his nonage (as other infants and common heires under age may doe) but alwayes be said to be of full age in respect of his Crown even as a Prior, Parson, Vicar, Deane, or other person incorporate shall be, which cannot by any meanes in law bee said to be within age, in respect of their incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h thing maketh an evident difference in our case, from the meaning of the former statute: for that a Prior, Deane, or Parson, being Aliens and no Denizens, might alwayes in time of peace demand lands in England, in respect of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, notwithstanding the said statute or common law against Aliens, as appeareth by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny booke cases yet extant: as also by the statute made in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, which was after the foresaid statute of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the third.</p>

This man (I say) so broken both within &amp; without, is it possible that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and her wise Councell should feare?
