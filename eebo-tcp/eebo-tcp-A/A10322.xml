         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to the author living,

the church of God by other
mens woorks, who am not able to doe it
by myne owne: have moved me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe
this learned treatise, which Doctor
<hi>Rainolds</hi> left (as many other exquisit tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
of his) shutt vp in the closett of some
private frends as in a fayre prison.</p>
            <p>Because my testimonie (or any mans
I know) is of much lesse waight then the
onely name of the author to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the

perhaps yeeld him more admirable to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teretie,
which without envie of his person
shal view the marks of thies graces in his
writings, or take them by storie.</p>
            <p>Touching the argument I will onely
say, that it seemeth the more woorthy
such a mans resolution, by how much it
hath bene formerly, or prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly is contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
amongst the learned. And if anie
man be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie minded to this, which is
the common iudgement of the reformed
churches, he (above others) shalbe my
debttor, for helping him to so good a mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes

more sparingly, there hath a doubt arisen: and diverse men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from
the primative churches time have bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diverse minds.</p>
            <p>For many of the fathers have gathered therevpon, that if a
mans wife committed whoredome &amp; fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he might not
onely put her away, but marrie another. Some others, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge
them namely S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> have thought that the man
might put away his wife but marrie another he might not.</p>
            <p>The Schooledivines of latter years, &amp; the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ists, as for the
most parte they were adicted comonly to S. <hi>Austins</hi> iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nt,
did likewise follow him herein &amp; the Popes mainteining their
doctrine for Catholique, have possessed the church of Rome
with this opinion. But since in our dayes the light of good
learning both for artes &amp; tongues hath shined more brightly
by Gods most gracious goodnes then in the former ages, and
the holy scriptures by the help thereof have bene the better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstoode:
the Pastors and Doctors of the reformed Churches
have percieved &amp; shewed, that if a mans wife defile her self with
fornication, he may not onely put her away by <hi>Christs</hi> Doctrine
but also marrie another. Wherein that they teach agreeably
to the truth, and not erroneously, as Iesuits &amp; Papists doe falsly
and vniustly charge them. I will make manifest and prove
(through Gods assistance) by expresse words of <hi>Christ,</hi> the truth
it self. And because our adversaries doe weene that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie
hereof is strongly proved by sundrie arguments and obiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which two of their newest writers <hi>Bellarmin</hi> the Iesuit &amp;
a namelesse author of an English pamphlet, have dillige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly laid
together: For the farther clearing therefore of the matter, and
taking away of doubts &amp; scruples I will set downe all their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections
in order, first out of the scriptures then of fathers, last
of reasons, and answer everie one of them particularly. So shall
it appeare to such as are not blinded with a fore-conceived
opinion and prejudice, that whatsoever shewe of probabilities
ate brought to the contrarie, yet the truth delivered by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<hi>Christ</hi> alloweth him whose wife committeth fornication
to put her away and marrie another.</p>
            <p>The proofe hier of is evident if <hi>Christs</hi> wordes be weighed in
the niententh Chapter of S. <hi>Mathews</hi> gospell. For<note n="e" place="margin">Math. 19. 3.</note> when the
Pharises asking him a question, whether it were lawfull for a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16007:5"/>
man to put away his wife for everie cause, received answer that
it was not, and therevpon saide vnto him, <hi>Why did</hi> Moses <hi>then
commande to give a bill of divorcement and to put her a way: Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
sayde vnto them;</hi> Moses <hi>suffered you because of the hardnes of
your harte to put awaye your wifes: But from the beginning it was not
so. And I say vnto you, that, whosoever shall put away his wife, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be for whoredome, and shall marrie another, doth commit adulterie:
and who so marrieth her that is put away, doth commit adulterie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this sentence, the clause of exception [<hi>except it bee for
whoredome</hi>] doth argue that he commiteth not adulterie, who,
having put away his wife for whoredome marrieth another.</p>
            <p>But he must needes commit it in doing so vnles the band of
marrirge be loosed and disolved. For who so marrieth another
as long as he is<note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vers 2</note> bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to the former,<note n="g" place="margin">vers, 3.</note> is an adulterer. The
band then of marriage is loosed &amp; dissolved betwene that man
and wife who are put assunder and divorced for whoredome.</p>
            <p>And if the band beloosed, the man may marry another: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it is written<note n="h" place="margin">1, Cor, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This argument doth firmly and necessarily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude the point
in question, if the first parte &amp; proposition of it be proved to
be true. For there is no controversie of any of the rest: beinge

committeth not adulterie, who, having put awaie his wife for

they doe bring soudry answers and evasions. The best
of all which as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> avoucheth, is, that those words [<hi>except

<hi>ment those words</hi>

&amp; shall marrie another doth commit adulteric. Whereby it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
that he is an adulterer who having put awaie his wife without

I know not: vnlesse it be to shewe that he can wrangle, and

his adversarie, when in trueth he doth not. Or perhaps, though
he durst not say for the particular, that it is taken here as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versative,
which he coulde not but most absurdly: Yet he
thought it policie to breede a surmise thereof for the generall,
that shallower conceits might imagin another sence therein,
they knew not what; and they whose brasen faces should serve
them thereto, might impudently brable, that our sence is not

an opposition and contrariety vnto that sentence agaynste
which they are brought in Now, the sentence is, that <hi>who so put

            <p>Wherefore, hee by consequent, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitteth not adulterie who
doth so for whoredome: If the particle bee adversative, and
must have words accordingly supplied, &amp; vnderstood to make
the sence percttt. Thus the shift and cavill which <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
hath drawen out of the double meaning of the Greeke worde,
is either idle and beateth the aire; or if it strike any, it striketh
himselfe, &amp; giveth his cause a deadly wound. Yea that which
he principally sought to confute, hee hath confirmed thereby.</p>
            <p>For sith the worde hath onely two significations exceptive,
and adverstive, neither durst he say that it is vsed here as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versative.
it foloweth he must graunt it to be as an exceptive: &amp;
soe the place rightly translated in our English (agreeable to the
other in the 5. of <hi>Mathew) except it be for whoredoe,</hi> which as in
their authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ticall latin text also doth out of controversie betoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
an exception.</p>
            <p>Having al passages therefore shutt againste him for scaping

            </p>
            <p>And this (<hi>he saieth</hi>) sufficeth for the maintenance of S. Austins
answer. For when it is said, whosoever shall put away his wife, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

the cause of woredome may be excepted, either because in that

            <p>The next trick of Sophistrie, whereto as to a shelter our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries

to the former branche of putting away the wife onely. To the
which intent, they say that there are some words wanting in
the text which must be supplied and perfected thus; <hi>Whosoever
shall put away his wife (which is not lawfull except it be for whoredome)
and marrieth another, doth commit adulterie.</hi> This devise doth <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>

of negation and negative exception. But our English Pamphlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to have shewed greater skill herein then <hi>Bellarmin.</hi> But men

            <p>The onely reason of adversaries remayning to bee answered,
stood vppon, and vrged by them as moste effectuall, and for
cible to the contrarye, is an example of like sentences: from
which, sith the like conclusion (say they) cannot bee inferred,
as wee inferre of this, the inferrence or this is faultye. And
faultie (I graunt) they might esteeme it iustly if the like con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clusions

            <p>But lett the examples, which they bring for proofe here of be
throughly sifted: And it will appeare that either the senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are vnlike, or the like conclusitons may bee inferred of
them. For of three sentences proposed to this end, the
the firste is out of Scripture in S. Iames Epistle<note n="d" place="margin">Iame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> had sinne: meaning by
this Phrase, as himself expoundeth it, <hi>that their sinne remained,</hi> that
is to say, continued and stoodt firme &amp; setled. The custome of
the Greeke tongue wherein <hi>S. Iames</hi> wrote, doth geve this Phrase
that sense, as also the <hi>Syriaque</hi> (the language vsed by <hi>Christ</hi>) tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slating
<hi>Christs</hi> words after the same manner: &amp; the matter tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
of doth argue that he meant not generally of sinne, but of
sinne being &amp; cleaving to a man in spetiall &amp; peculiar sort. For
as<note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 12, 47</note> 
               <hi>the servant that knew his Maisters will, and did not according to it,
shalbe beaten with many stripes: but he that knew it not, and yet did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt

whereto the punishment auswereth <hi>he that knoweth how

But he that knoweth not how to doe well, &amp; doth evill, hath not sinne
sticking to him, his sinne remaineth not, hee sinneth not so greatly &amp; grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously.</hi>
Wherefore when <hi>Bellarmin</hi> draweth out of that sentence
such a conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as if <hi>S. Iames</hi> in saying there is sinne to him, had
simply meant, hee <hi>sinneth; Bellarmin</hi> mistaketh the meaning of
the sentence; which if the text it self cannot informe him,<note n="g" place="margin">Tho Aquin Hugo Card et Guilliand. in Iacob. 4</note> his
doctors well considered may. But take the right meaning &amp; the
conclusion wilbe sound. <hi>Whosoever doth not good and honest things,
except it he of ignoraunce, he sinneth desperatelie &amp; mainely. Therefore
whoso of ignorance omitteth to doe them, he sinneth not desperately.</hi> And
thus our conclusion drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Christs</hi> sentence is rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed

            <p>The first sentence then alleaged by S. <hi>Austin</hi> and after him
pressed by our adversaries out of the scripturs, is soe farr from
disprooving, that it prooveth rather the like conclusions from

are not like to <hi>Christs.</hi> For <hi>Christs</hi> is from Heaven, full of truth

might have disputed as fitly to their purpose, and prooved it as

marrieth her that is put away, even for whoredome too, doth committ
adulterie. The band then of Marriage is not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>solved and loosed by
her putting away: but company debarred onely. For hee that marrieth
her should not commit adulterie vnlesse shee were bound yet to her former
husband.</hi> And thus farr <hi>Bellarmin</hi> sayth well; but superfluou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly.
For the words may not bee generally taken, sith they have
relation to the former sentence, whereto they are coupled; and
that sentence speaketh of her which is put away <hi>except for whore
dome.</hi> Their meaning then must n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edes bee that hee who mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rieth
her which is so put away doth commit adulterie. Neither
could <hi>Bellarmin</hi> bee ignoraunt hereof, or doubt with any likely
hoode, but that this is our iudgment, and would bee our ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.
Wherefore his two forked dispute about the words, was a
flourish onely to make vs a frayde: as if hee fought with a two
hand sword, which would kill all that came in his way. But
now hee goeth forward vpon his enemies pike, &amp; layeth about
him on the other side. <hi>If the words must bee taken with the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
then hee that marrieth a whore put away from her husband,
committeth not adulterie. And consequently the whore is in better
case then the innocent and chaste. For the whore is free and may be mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ried,
wheras the innocent that is vniustly put away, can neither have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:16007:14"/>
her former husband, nor marrie another. But this most absurd, that
the law of Christ beeing most iust, would have her to bee in better case
and state, that is iustly put away, then her that is vniustly.</hi> For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
vnto which reason of <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> I would spurr him a ques<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,
whether by the Popes law, which forbiddeth a man that

&amp; admitteth on thereto that hath kept or happely keepeth

man: and if a whoremonger bee so by the Popes law,<note n="i" place="margin">c, Quia circa</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wee ought to iudge that this is most absurd or noe. Here
if hee should answer mee that the Popes law is not most iust and
therefore noe marvell if it have some such things as were most ab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>surd
to bee imagined by <hi>Christs</hi> law: I must acknowledge hee
spake reason. Well, I would spurre him then another questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
whether hee thinke that I am in better case then any Iesuit, yea,
then the best of them all. Phy hee will answer, there is noe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.
The best? nay the worst of them is in better case then
I am: Yet I may marry if I list: and none of them may because
of their vowe. Belike this Vow-Doctrine was not established
by the law of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is most iust, but by<note n="k" place="margin">Extra. c. me minimus. Quiclerici velvoventes.</note> the Popes lawe
rather. Or it is most absurd that a poore Christian should bee
in better case, then the proudest Iesuit. But heere peradventure
the man will say rather that wee are Heretiques, and they Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liques,
and the meanest Catholique is in better case, even for
his faiths sake, then any Heretique whatsoever: which if he doe
as it is likely, neither can hee say ought with probability but to
this effect, then hath hee confuted and overthrowen his own argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For by this answere hee cannot chuse but graunt that
the simplest woman being put away vnjustly from her husband
is in better case for her chastities sake, though shee may not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
then whatsoever whore that may. And I hope hee wil not
say that the stewes and curtizans at Rome are in better case then
honest matrons there, divorced from their husbands. Yet may
none of these, while their husbands live bee ioyned to others:
whereas the curtizans are free to marrie whom they will, if any
will marrie them, who are soe free. Howbeit, lest any place of ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>velling
bee left him, and of pretending a difference betweene
those, who having had the vse of marriage lose the benefit of it,

Yea, this should of reason have greater force and weight
then <hi>Bellarmins</hi> of the same spinning. For he sayth that <hi>Marke</hi>
did not write his Gospell to add ought to <hi>Mathew.</hi> Which

that I have woven after <hi>Bellarmins</hi> patterne, it is contrariewise;
that <hi>Esay</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> did not write to add ought to the Psalmes or

colour to prove that their sayinges should not bee absolutely
true, and not depend of exceptions mentioned so long after,
neither meane to bee ioyned to them: Chiefly for alianes from
the Common-wealth of Israell, such as they that heard <hi>Iob</hi> and
<hi>Ionas</hi> were, who lived not to read the Doctrine of <hi>Christ</hi> in
his Prophets and Apostles. Wherefore seeing <hi>Bellarmin</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced

this on generall sentences of <hi>Iob, David, Salomon,</hi> that an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite,

must acknowledg that S. <hi>Paul</hi> meant, the band is not comonly
loosed but by death, not that it is never at all loosed otherwise
absolutely and simply. <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to frustrate and avoyde this
answere, sayth that it may bee proved by foure reasons: which
hee bringeth forth poore, vnarmed, weake ones of his owne
mustering, and with a strong hand putteth them to flight:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16007:20"/>
that soe men imagining these are all that can be alleaged on our
side for the proofe thereof, might thinke that our whole force
is quite discomfited and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath wone the feilde. I
have heard say that <hi>there is cunning in daubing.</hi> Surely there is
cunning in this kinde of dealing. Neither is it for nothing that
<note n="c" place="margin">Birstow, Motive. 31.</note> one of their Glorious Champions doth vaunte that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon

In deede they would beare the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sorte in hand, that their
learned men in handling of questions and controversies of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
doe set downe all obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that can be made of our parte.
And I graunt, they set downe more then ofte tymes themselves
can soundly answere. Yet they vse discretion therein by their
leave: and many a strong reason which would trouble them
fowly if it came in place, they are content to winck at and say
nothing of it, whereto they joyne this policy now and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also,
that they take vpon them to bee as it were our proctours and at
turneys, in shewing what may bee sayd for vs. Vnder which
pretence they bring in such things as having a ready solution
with the obiection, and proving vnsound, may turne to out
causes discredit and to ours. So the Iesuit here his argument
being grounded vppon two places, the one to the Romans, the
other to the Corinthyans, wee countermyning the whole with
one answere: hee sayth that our answere may bee proved by
foure reasons, which hee gathereth out of circumstances of the
former place, all such as the later hath neither any kinred with,
and discoverceth them to be of no valew. But of the reasons,
which I have brought to prove our answere fitting both the
places, and partly confirming that S. <hi>Paule</hi> might well meane
the same in these, which in the like hee meant; partly demonstra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting
that certaynly hee did soe, because it were not true els that
hee teacheth of the libertie of <hi>Christians</hi> forsaken by the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers;
these reasons <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth, not touch. No marveil:
for they are too hot. And it is likely that he studied not what
might be most stronglie said in our defence, but rather what
most weakely: that so he might seeme to ioyne battaile with vs,

Finally, concerning that for the vpshoote hee vrgeth

the man and wife can not bee made free from the <hi>band of Ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage</hi>
by any seperatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but by death onely, because while the law

goe no farther then the drift it self of the samilytude, which <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>larmin</hi>
doth vrge, if it requier absolutely that the band of Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage
may bee no way loosed but onely by the husbands or the

wives death: then neither is it loosed, if the vnbeleever doe for
sake the Christian: neither if the husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d become a Monke or the
wife a Nunne; neither if the Pope see cause to dispence with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them. And will not this fansie of his about that drift
drive him into greater inconvenience yet: to weet, that every
woman, whose husband is dead, ought to marry another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Iewes were bound to become Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s after the death
of the Lawe? or of the other side, that the Iewes are not bound
vnder payne of damnation to become Christians, because no
widowe is bound vnder payne of death to take another hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band?
or (if these absurdities bee not great enough) that dead
men ought to marry, because<note n="v" place="margin">Rom 7. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The Iewes by duty should bee vnto

to whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, should rather not beleeve in <hi>Christ,</hi>
because<note n="x" place="margin">1, Cor. 7. 8.</note> he wished widowes rather not to marry? Of the which
consequences if some bee esteemed erroneous by Papists some
not esteemed onely, but are so in deede, the most have impious
folly ioyned with vntruth: Let <hi>Bellarmin</hi> acknowledg that simi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>litudes
must not bee sett vpon the racke, nor the drift thereof
bee stretched and pressed in such sorte, as if they ought iust in

are resembled. It sufficeth if in a generall analogy and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the principall poynt wherein things are matched, and
compared together, they bee eche like to other, and both agree
in one qualitie. Which here is observed in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> compariso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the state of Marriage, with the state of man before and after

that they should bring forth <hi>fruite (the fruites of the Spirit)
vnto God.</hi> And thus seing neither the drift of the similytude,
nor the iudgment of the Fathers, nor the playnnesse of the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
so oftentymes repeated, doe disprove our answer and expo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sition
of the place: our answer proved by Scripture standeth
firme and sure and therefore the third place vrged by our adver<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>saries,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:16007:23"/>
is sutable to the former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So is the fourth &amp; last; taken out of the first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the Corithians
the seaventh Chaptera</hi> To them who are Married, it is not I that
give commandement, but the Lord: Let not the wife depart from her
husband: but if shee depart too, let her remayne vnmarried. or bee recon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciled
vnto her husband. Wherein <hi>(as Bellarmin reasoneth)</hi> the
words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> If, shee depart, and so forth are meant of a woman,
which parteth from her husband vpon a cause of iust divocement,
as namely for whordom, haeresie, and the rest whatsoever they be, &amp; not
of her which parteth without any such cause. But concerning her of
whom the words are meant, S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth most playnely shee may not
marrie another. Therefore even a cause of iust divorcement looseth
not the band of Marriage neither is it lawfull for married folckes to mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
others, although they beesevered and put asunder by iust divorceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</p>
            <p>And of this argument <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth say that it is altogether
insoluble. In saying whereof hee seemeth to confesse that none
of the former arguments were so, but might bee answered and
confuted. His confession touching them hath reason with it:
I must needs approve it. But his vaunt of this is like that of<note n="b" place="margin">1 King. 20. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>Ben
hadads that the dust of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Samaria would not bee enough to all the people
that followed him for every man an handfull. To whom the King
of Israel sayde, Let not him that girdeth his harnies, boast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as hee that putteth it off. Bellarmin</hi> hath skarcly girt his harneis
yet, &amp; that which hee hath girt, is vnservisable bad harneis too.</p>
            <p>For the formost parte thereof, his proposition a vouching
that the words <hi>If shee depart, and so forth, are meant of her onely which
parteth from her husband vpon a iust cause of divocement, as namely
for whordom heresie, and such like,</hi> is faulty sundry wayes: seing
they are neither meant of her onely which parteth for a iust
cause; and though<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they bee also meant of her which parteth
for any other iust cause, yet not of her which for whoredom.</p>
            <p>Moreover the conclusion knitting vpp his argument with
<hi>Therefore even a iust cause of divorcement looseth not the band of Mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riage,</hi>
is guilfully sett downe: being vttered in the forme of a par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ticular,
and true so, taking divorcement as hee doth; but inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to carry the force of a generall, so by fraude and faulshood
to beare away the poynt in questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Of both the which to treat
in ordre, his proposition hee presumeth of as most certayne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16007:23"/>
in (his iudgment) <hi>Paule would not have sayde of her who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
without some such cause, Let her remayne vnmarried, or bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
vnto her husband; but hee would have sayde, Let her remayne
vnmarried till shee bee reconciled vnto her husband, &amp; let her come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
vnto her husband in any case.</hi> And why doth <hi>Bellarmin</hi>
thynke so? His reasons follow. For <hi>Paul</hi> could not permitt <hi>an
vniust divorcemnt agaynst the expresse commandement of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, <hi>if in the same Chapter</hi> Paul <hi>permitteth not the man and wife to
refrayne from carnall company for prayers fake, and for a tyme, except
it bee with consent: How should bee permitt the wife to remayne sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from her husband agaynst his will, without any cause of iust divorce<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
In deede if it had lyen in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> power to stay &amp; refraine

               <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himself saith that
there can no certaintie be gathered out of their sayings, when
they agree not among themselves. It is a thing graunted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by
our adversaries that the <hi>Fathers</hi> have not strength enough to
prove ought vnlesse they all consent in one. But the fathers do
not all consent in one about the point wee treat of, as it shalbe
shewed, Our adversaries therefore must graunt that the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which they holde in this point, cannot be proved by <hi>Fathers.</hi>
Nay they are in danger of being enforced to graunt a farther

circumstances which may breed doubt both particularly, of

principall point remayning to be shewed, namely that the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
consent not all in one for the Papists doctrine,</hi> is most cleare and
evident out of all controversie. In so much that many even of
them also whom <hi>Bellarmin</hi> alleageth, and the Pamphletter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, as making for it, make in deed against it: and those of
the chiefest and formost rankes spetially, in the first, the second,
the third, the fourth hundred yeares after <hi>Christ.</hi> All the which
agree and teach with one consent that the man forsaking his
wife for her adulterie, is free to marrie againe: save such of them
onely, as in this very point of doctrine touching, marriage are
tainted with, error by the iudgement and censure of Papists
themselves. A token of the vanetie and folly of our adversaries
<hi>Bellarmin</hi> and the Pamphletter: who by naming one at least
in everie age, would needes make a shewe of having the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of all ages with them, whereas it wilbe seene hereby, that
in many we have the most and best; and they, either none at all,
or none sound. For in the first hundred yeares after <hi>Christ</hi> all
that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> sayth they have, is the testimony of <hi>Clemens</hi> in

handleth, and cause that he geveth thereof doe lead vs to this

it followeth that the Byshops who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

what errour so absurd that may not be defended by perverse

to take other wives while the former live, though adulteresses.
But this giving of advise is in truth an argument that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
iudged a man no adulterer, if hee tooke another wife. Els
would they have given not advise and counsail, but charge and
commandement to refraine from it; and (as it is likely) restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

(as it seemeth) those who being vnder the care of their

that the amerciement should be taken away because some would
doe men iniurie of purpose to fulfill their lusts with paying of a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16007:51"/>
shilling or two. But the <hi>Roman</hi> governours tooke contrarie order,

trespassing by sharpnes of the punishment to be inflicted on them

of adultery: And then should <hi>Bell.</hi> mouth be the sooner
stopped for his fourth reason. Which yet in the mean while doth

wives may not marry againe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vserers &amp; extortio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ers procuring

            <p>The fifth &amp; last is, that even among the Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too, where good
