         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Whole Duty of
Prayer,</hi> having met with
so good a Reception in the
World, I have, at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
and Importunity of some Friends,
recommended to the Press this remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tract, bearing the Title of the
<hi>Whole Duty of Meditation,</hi> by that
Reverend and Worthy Author of the
<hi>Whole Duty of Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Subject I need not commend, for
it carries its Worth along with it; and
to every Christian will appear both
pleasant and profitable: For by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
the truly Religious may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with the Almighty, and from
the Throne of Grace find Help and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in time of Need; to those which
are Aery, and are the Darlings of
<pb facs="tcp:109758:3"/>
the World, this Gift may procure
a well-compos'd Mind. For if he
who by often looking on a Ring
with a Death's Head, at last
grew sober; who knows but by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Meditating, their Hearts may be
brought into a more serious and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
frame?</p>
            <p>The Royal Prophet stiles Meditation
the Food of the Soul, <hi>Psal. 63. 4. My
soul shall be satisfied as with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and fatness, while I meditate
on thee.</hi> The Heart never willingly
fixeth upon Heaven, till the Almighty
is the <hi>Treasure</hi> of it; for where any
Man's <hi>Treasure</hi> is, there will his
<hi>Heart</hi> be also. Now, it cannot easily
meditate, but where it doth delight.
<hi>Psal. 119. 97. Love</hi> is the Weight of
the Soul; it readily moves to its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Object. <hi>Mary</hi> will not depart
from the Sepulchre where Christ had
lain, before she had made Enquiry
where she might see him whom her
Soul loved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:109758:3"/>
It is the Duty of every good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
to observe the Prophet Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's
Rule, <hi>Psal. 16. 8. to set the
Lord always before him,</hi> that he
may be in his <hi>fear all the day
long.</hi> There is nothing more unsted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast
than the Mind of Man; and
therefore nothing can so well compose
it, as True Sanctity; which brings
such great Advantages, that with
holy <hi>Job,</hi> it makes the Soul both se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and willing <hi>to acquaint it
self with God, that it may be at
peace,</hi> Iob 22. 21. He is the
Rest of the Soul; and the more it
knows of him, the more desirous it
is to reside with him, that it may
know more: The more it tasteth of
his <hi>Favour,</hi> the more it longeth after
his <hi>Glory,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> did, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.
17, 18.</p>
            <p>What the <hi>Philosopher</hi> said of all
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> is true only of the
<hi>Knowledge of God;</hi> that it is
<hi>Quies Intellectus.</hi> And therefore
<pb facs="tcp:109758:4"/>
our Saviour calleth it <hi>Eternal Life,</hi>
Iohn 17. 3. in which alone the
Soul doth rest. Now, one excellent
Means of fixing the Heart on God,
is <hi>Meditation;</hi> whereby the highly
Pious summons together <hi>all that is
within them, to bless his Name,</hi>
Psal. <hi>103.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meditation</hi> is the Wing of the
Soul, which carrieth the Affections
thereof to Things Above. By this,
with <hi>Moses,</hi> it goeth up <hi>to the
top of Mount</hi> Pisgah, <hi>to take a
Prospect of the Promised Land.</hi>
It is, as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi>
saith of Prayer, <hi>a Conversing with
God.</hi> And as St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
saith of <hi>Faith,</hi> so may we of <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi>
it makes <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi>
and <hi>Precepts,</hi> and <hi>Promises,</hi> ours,
by giving us a fuller Possession of
them.</p>
            <p>Hereby we hold fast what we
have learned; we awaken our <hi>Faith,</hi>
inflame our <hi>Love,</hi> strengthen our
<pb facs="tcp:109758:4"/>
               <hi>Hope,</hi> revive our <hi>Desires,</hi> encrease
our <hi>Joys</hi> in God; we furnish our
Hearts, and fill our Mouths with
Materials of Prayer; we slacken
our <hi>Affections</hi> from the <hi>World,</hi>
we <hi>pre-acquaint</hi> our selves with
those Glories which we yet but hope
for, and get some knowledge of that
<hi>Love of Christ which passeth
Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Necessity, Excellency,</hi> and
<hi>Usefulness</hi> of this Christian Duty, the
Reverend Author of this Tract hath
Elegantly described; which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
worthy Perusal of such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to acquaint and furnish them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with so excellent a part of
Christian Skill, whereby we may
be filled with the Fulness of God,
and be always able continually to say,
<hi>My Heart is fixed, O God, my
Heart is fixed; I will sing, and give
Praise.</hi>

DIVINE
MEDITATION.</head>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <head>SECT. I. What Meditation is.</head>
               <p>FIRST, <hi>Divine Meditation</hi>
differs from <hi>Occasional,</hi> by
these Examples: When you
hear the Hour of the Day
or Night, think with thy self, <hi>What
Thoughts, O my God, have I had of thee,
this Hour? I am now nearer the silent
Grave, and know not how soon I may be
arrested by the Hand of Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE are like Ejaculatory Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
which tho' they are as Parenthesis
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109758:6"/>
in our Worldly Employment, yet they
signifie more than all the rest of the
Business we are employed in; but Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
is of longer Duration than
solemn Prayer upon Ordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>II. SECONDLY, It differs from
Study: For Study consists of those
things that are most knotty and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
and generally such as afford lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Spiritual Nourishment; but the
Subject of Divine Meditation, concerns
our Eternal Happiness: The End of
Study is Knowledge, but the End of
Meditation is Sanctity.</p>
               <p>III. THIRDLY, It differs from
Contemplation: For Contemplation
is applicable to the Beatifical Vision,
where the Angels behold the Face of
the Almighty: Now Meditation is like
Fire kindling; and Contemplation, the
flaming of it when fully kindled: The
one is like the Spouses Seeking of Christ;
and the other, like her Enjoying of
him.</p>
               <p>IV. FOURTHLY, To conclude;
<hi>Meditation</hi> is, a a serious and solemn
considering of Heavenly Things, to the
end we may understand how much
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109758:6"/>
it concerns us, and that our Hearts
thereby may be raised to some holy Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Resolutions. Now there
are Four kinds of Solemn Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
according to their several Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>V. FIRST, Some Solemn Meditations
are, upon the hearing of Sermons: which
is a very useful and necessary Practice
amongst Christians; and it is better to
hear one Sermon, and meditate on it,
than to hear two, and meditate of
neither. Now, to prescribe a Method for
Meditating on Sermons, is neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
nor possible; since the Methods
of Sermons are various, therefore the
Mediatours are to observe the Method
of the Sermon they meditate upon;
and the Fruits of such Meditations, is
to work those Truths, Advices, and
Motives, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon our Affections,
that are propos'd to us in the Sermon.</p>
               <p>VI. THE Second kind of Solemn
Meditation, is, when upon some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
Occasion, spiritual Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
or Temptation, we retire, and
pour out our Souls in Prayers, Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which connot but in a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109758:7"/>
very large sence be styled Prayer, being
mix'd of such variety, as sometimes
speaking to the Great Majesty of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and humbly acknowledging how
we stand affected to Him and his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances;
sometimes we examine our
Soul, chiding, encouraging, or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
it; sometimes we reason with
our selves, what holy Resolutions we
design to put in practice, and what we
intend to supplicate the Almighty.
Many Instances of this nature you may
find in <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. and other Psalms
which cannot properly be called Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but Solemn Meditations.</p>
               <p>VII. THE Third kind of Solemn
Meditation, are those that are upon
Scripture, which is the Word of God,
and <hi>his words are pure, even as the silver
tried seven times in the fire,</hi> Psal. 12. 6.
Our Saviour's Precept, is, That we
should <hi>search the Scriptures,</hi> Joh. 5. 39.
And St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids us <hi>prove all things,</hi>
1 Thes. 5. 21. And if we meditate on
God's Word, which is the Golden Rule
of all our Devotions, we shall acquire
that Peace to our Souls, which the
World cannot give, nor none upon
Earth can take from us; for all his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109758:7"/>
                  <hi>Promises are Yea, and Amen,</hi> 2 Cor.
1. 20.</p>
               <p>VIII. THE Last kind of Meditation,
is, upon some Practical Truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
which is, the planting and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
of all true Vertue among Men;
to <hi>grow in grace,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. to <hi>cleanse
our selves from all filthiness both of flesh
and spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. And endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to take hold of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s pressing
Argument to his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to <hi>be
stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding
in the work of the Lord;</hi> then this Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
will infallibly appertain to us,
That <hi>our labour shall not be in vain in
the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 58.</p>

               <p>THAT <hi>Isaac</hi> did not neglect So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Meditation, is evident, by
reason he went out into the Fields to
perform it; and to shew that it was a
Set-Duty, 'tis said, that <hi>he went ont to
meditate.</hi> And God commanded <hi>Ioshua</hi>
to perform this Duty, as a chief means
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109758:8"/>
for the keeping of the Law, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 1. 18.
And indeed we ought not to forget so
important an Exercise; for the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Sin, is the want of Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and not want of Knowledge:
<hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 3. For, who is there, almost, in
the World, that knows not but that he
must die, but how few are they that
consider it? <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 29.</p>
               <p>II. NEXT, The Necessity of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is very material: For none can
enter into a State of Conversion, who
thinks it insignificant. To confirm
which, we have it recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the Story of the Prodigal Son,
who listed himself in Harlots com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;
but upon his submissive return,
was receiv'd again into his Father's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
Now, this is the Method of the
Converted: First, He hears the sacred
Truth of God's Word, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
by it. Secondly, He considers
and meditates upon it, and sees how
much it concerns himself. Thirdly,
He is affected with them; and being
thus affected, it raiseth holy Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of better Obedience.</p>
               <p>III. BUT some will object and say,
I am Illiterate, and cannot attain to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109758:8"/>
it, and therefore I must relinquish it,
and leave it to the Learned, who is
best able to perform a Duty of so great
Importance. To which I answer, as in
the Mathematical Science; He that is
a rational Man, and does but improve
his Reason, though he hath neither
Tongues nor Arts to assist him, may
understand and grow to an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Excellency in any Art<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he has
God's Assistance, and does but exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and improve it, he may reap the
Benefit and Fruit of Meditation.</p>
               <p>IV. OTHERS will object, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
It is a very hard Duty. To
which my Replication is this; That
the harder any thing seems, it is the
more excellent when it is attained;
but the Obstacle is apparent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrs
it not to be consonant to our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
Wills and Affections; and the
more dissonant any thing is to that
which is Evil, the more congruous it
is to sublimer Actions: For it cannot
reasonably be expected that any Duty
should be performed at the first, with
much facility. For Example; the
Seven Liberal Sciences, which are of
great Excellency in Temporal Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109758:9"/>
are not so easily attained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sollicitation and Sedulity.</p>
               <p>V. NOW the reason is evident; for
this Duty is powerful in mortifying
Corruptions: dulcified things nourish
and pamper the Body, and bitter things
gives a purgation: Therefore, if you
will only perform those Duties that are
pleasant and delectable, they will only
nourish, not purge out Corruption.
Therefore implore the Almighty to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
your Hearts with his divine Love;
and then this Duty will not only be
facile and delightful, but will so affect
the Undertaker, that it will be very
difficult to avoid a Duty of so great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;
for it is as great a difficulty
to take our Affections off from what
we admire, as it is to place 'em upon
what we abhorr: For, bid the covetous
Person forsake his Gold and Silver, and
bid him entertain the Thoughts of
Things Celestial, and he'll find an
equal Difficulty in both.</p>
               <p>VI. INDEED, the Love of the
Almighty, and Desire of Spiritual
Things, are acquired by Meditation;
and when once our Hearts are inflam'd
by that Exercise, then our Meditations
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109758:9"/>
are inflam'd by Love: For, as Sparks
of Fire <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is first blown up before the
Flame encreases; so the Difficulty of
Meditation appears at the beginning,
when there is but, as it were, a Spark
of divine Love in the Heart, it will
require some Pains, by Meditation,
to blow it up to a Flame; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Heart will be so fervent
with these Conflagrates of Love, that
it will so inflame all the Thoughts,
and create in us not only Facility,
but a Necessity to meditate on Things
Spiritual.</p>
               <p>VII. Now some will object, If it be
a Duty so Necessary, how comes it to
pass, that it hath been so geeerally
Neglected by most Christians? To
which I answer; That it hath been
practised by many in ancient Times,
and by many modern Christians. The
Sacred Scriptures inform us, and it is
evident that the Psalms of the Royal
Prophet, are frequently digested into
Meditations: But this being a Private
Closet-Duty, the Omission nor Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of it could not be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of; and so the Omission of it
could not be reprehended, nor Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109758:10"/>
observed. Lastly, The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
and Instructions for Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
have been generally very abstruse
and intricate.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="section">
               <head>SECT. III. Rules and Directions for Meditation.</head>
               <p>AS to the Place, that must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
remote from Society and
Disturbance; the Patriarch <hi>Isaac</hi> went
into the Fields, our Blessed Saviour
into a Garden; and the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
adviseth us to <hi>enter into our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and be still,</hi> Psal. 4. 4. And Christ
commands us, to <hi>enter into our Closet,
and shut the door.</hi> Now the reason of
the Privacy is this, that we might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no Interruption, or any Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
nor be forced to break off abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before the Duty be ended; next,
that we may be recluse from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of all Mortals that we may
neither be heard nor seen; for there
are divers Gestures and Expressions,
which are not requisite or necessary for
any but God and the Soul to be privy
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109758:10"/>
to: Now what Place soever you find
to be necessary for this important
Duty, be sollicitous to make choiee of.</p>
               <p>II. As for the Time; the best Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
is in the Morning: for the
First Fruits of the Day being Holy, all
the rest are Sanctified. Moreover, our
Thoughts being then not polluted with
worldly Affairs, they are not so liable
to distraction: and the Body it self is
more serene than after Meals; and this
Duty requires a vacuity in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;
not only because the Head will
be more perspicuous and apt for Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but also, because many Passages
of Meditation require so much Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Mind, and Fervency of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
that they do hinder Digestion:
And this Duty being performed in the
Morning, it will have an influence upon
the whole Day. But this Rule is not
universal; for we read, that <hi>Isaac</hi> went
forth in the Evening to medirate,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63. And if the Subject of
your Meditation be a Sermon, then
perhaps the properest time is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after the hearing of it, before
your Affections cool, or your Memory
fail you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:109758:11"/>
III. FOR the Duration; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Parts of Meditation are so
many, as Preparation, Considerations,
Affections, Resolutions, and the like:
And not one of these are to be past
slightly over; for Affections are not
quickly raised: nor are we to cease
blowing the fire, if it flame, until it be
well kindled; Half an Hour may be
reckon'd to be the least for Beginners,
and an Hour for those that are Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
in this Duty.</p>
               <p>IV. But in this Particular, there is
Two Rules especially to be observed:
First, That as we ought not to desist
from our Prayers before that temper
and frame or heart is wrought, which
is suitable to the Requests of our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions;
so we should not desist in our
Confession of Sin, till our Hearts are
truly sensible, and humbled for Sin;
neither should we slacken our Praises,
until our Hearts are filled with holy
Admirings, and inflamed with the Love
of the Almighty. Now, the End of
Meditation, are Affections and Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
therefore we should not desist
till those are effected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:109758:11"/>
V. SO in Private Prayer, when we
find our Hearts enlarged by the Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Spirit of Supplication upon
us, we are not to desist, unless by our
persisting in that Duty, we omit ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to which we are more particularly
obliged at that juncture; so in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
when we perceive the Heart
affected, we are to continue it: But
this Caution must be observ'd, That
in our Enlargements, we must not
continue them longer than while they
flow freely, without much Straining
and Compulsion: for Honey which
comes freely from the Comb, is pure;
but forced by Heat and Pressure, is not
so well relish'd. Now, if the Heart is
dead, we must use our utmost dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to awaken it; and when once
our Hearts are inflamed, and enlarged
by holy Affections in an extraordinary
manner, 'tis but an impediment to our
Affections to return to the Meditation
of those Points that raised them.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="section">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:109758:12"/>
               <head>SECT. IV. Of the Subject and Method of
Meditation.</head>
               <p>FIRST, Avoid Controversie, for
that will convert Meditation into
Study; and nice Speculations, for they
are sapless without Nutriment: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
being so light, they fluctuate in
the Brain, and want ponderosity to
sink them down into the Heart; and
inddeed, were they admitted, they are
so insignificant, as the Heart, by its
reception, could acquire no Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But let the Subject of your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
be the plainest, powerfullest,
and usefullest Verities of the Almighty,
as <hi>Death, Iudgment, Hell,</hi> and <hi>Heaven;</hi>
the <hi>Mercies of God,</hi> our own <hi>Sins,</hi> and
the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of a <hi>crucified
Saviour,</hi> Contemplate on that which
is most suitable to your Spiritual
Wants; as in the time of Desertion,
meditate most of the Love and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God, and thy own Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:109758:12"/>
II. NOW the Rules for Meditation
are these Three: <hi>1st.</hi> Preparatory.
<hi>2dly.</hi> For the Body of the Duty. And,
<hi>3dly.</hi> The Conclusion. In our Duty
of Preparation, besides the choice of
the Subject, we are to be convinced and
affected with the Presence of the
Deity, and to use fervent Prayer for
the Divine Assistance. Secondly, For
the Body of Meditation, it consists of
Three Parts: The First is, Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
which is, the convincing our
Hearts of several Verities appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to that Subject whereof we me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>III. IF the Subject of our Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
be</hi> Death, <hi>the Considerations may
run thus:</hi> Alas, O my Immmortal
Soul! the Manner, Time and Place
where we shall expire, we are ignoraut
of; generally Mens Lives come to a
period sooner than they expect; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, whensoever that Hour or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
approaches, we must bid adieu to
Honours, Pleasures, Riches, Friends,
and at last, our own frail Bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second Part, is, Affections;
whether it be Love of God, Christ, or
Spiritual Things; despising of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109758:13"/>
World, admiring of the Omnipotency,
or any other Spiritual Affection. The
Third Part, are, Resolutions to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
that which is agreeable to God's
Command, and to desist from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Evil.</p>
               <p>IV. NOW that this is the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and genuine way of Meditation,
evidently appears: First, Because it
is not Artificial, and such as requires
Learning, as those Instructions are
which advise us to consider the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
Final, Formal, Material Cause of
Defunction, with the Adjuncts, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants,
and Concatenations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which though they, perhaps, may
please the Learned, yet such difficult
words astonish the Ignorant. Now,
this is the Method by which every one
that is brought home to God, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
               <p>V. AND the first thing in Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
is, our being convinced of some
Truths; which Conviction raiseth Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:
For if the Verities of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Omnipotence end in Conviction,
and go no further; nay, if they end in
Aflections only, and never arrive to
Resolutions of shunning Evil, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109758:13"/>
performing of Good, Conversion can
never be perfected. As for Example:
One is convinced that he is a miserable,
undone Wretch, by reason of Original
and Actual Abomination: Upon this
Conviction, Fear and Sorrow are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited;
yet if these do not operate in
us a fixed Resolution of forsaking those
Sins, we are yet in our Sins, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted.
Thirdly, There are several
things for the concluding of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which I shall treat of in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
order.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="5" type="section">
               <head>SECT. V. Of being affected with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Presence.</head>
               <p>WE are to consider, God is present
in all places, as really and Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
as he is in Heaven: For, Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
did not create Heaven for his
Confinement, but to manifest his
Glory; for <hi>the Heaven of Heavens are
not able to contain him;</hi> neither is
the Almighty included by, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from any place: And though
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109758:14"/>
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> said, <hi>Surely the Lord was in this
place, and I knew it not,</hi> Gen. 28. 16.
yet we must not imagine that <hi>Iacob</hi>
was ignorant of the Verity of it, but
did not actually consider it; but the
the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> in the 139th. Psalm, is
perspicuous in explaining and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Omnipresence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
               <p>II. NEXT, we must consider, That
the Almighty doth more peculiarly
observe his Servants, while they are
performing of heavenly Duties: Yet
this is to be understood, not as if God
observ'd us more at one time than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in respect of his Omnisciency;
but we may inferr That God is much
more offended with us, if our Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Frame of Heart, be more
irreverent and unholy in the Duty of
Prayer and Meditation, than in the
Duties of our particular Calling.</p>
               <p>III. WE may consider with our
selves, That Christ doth actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
us, especially in these Duties of
Sanctity: For it is not the remoteness
of Place that doth obstruct Christ's
Omnisciency, and exact observing of
us. Little did <hi>Nathanael</hi> think that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109758:14"/>
Christ saw him under the Fig-Tree:
<hi>Nathanael</hi> did not perceive Christ,
neither then was he corporally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
yet Christ beheld <hi>Nathanael</hi> when
he prayed. So Christ beheld St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>
before the Heavens were opened,
and the opening of the Heavens was
not; that thereby Christ might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
the better to behold St. <hi>Stephen,</hi>
but that this holy Proto-Martyr might
thereby be the better enabled to discern
that Christ looked on him.</p>
               <p>IV. AND without all controversie,
the Almighty observes and knows with
what Reverence, Faith, and Love, we
address our selves to him; for else our
Prayers would be fruitless, and our
Faith ineffectual: For, how could he
distribute to us according to our Faith,
if he knew not the extent of it? If
the inferiour frame of our Hearts were
not observed by Omnipotency, we
may then inferr, that an Hypocrite
which can utter extraordinary Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
should acquire more by his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
to the Almighty, than a true
<hi>Nathanael,</hi> in whom there is no guile.</p>
               <p>V. Suppose that thou hadst lived in
that Age when Christ was upon Earth,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109758:15"/>
or that he were corpotally present now,
near thy Habitation; consider with
what Joy, Reverence, Alacrity, and
Assurance, thou wouldst address thy
self to him for the Pardon of thy Sins,
or for any other Mercy thou stoodst
in need of: After the same manner
thou mayst now address thy self; his
remoteness from thee, in respect of a
Corporal Presence, doth not diminish
his Power to discern thy Wants, or
give an Audit to thy Petitions; nor his
being now glorified, doth not derogate
his Benevolence to grant thy Requests,
than if he were corporally present, in
the Room with thee in the form of a
Servant, as he was once at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. THE Glory of Christ doth not
slacken his Love and Goodness; for
Christ is the express Image of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and God's Attributes are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant:
The Majesty of Heaven doth
not set Limits unto his Goodness, and
make that finite; nor doth his Bounty
make his Omnipotency less glorious:
His Goodness makes his Deity more
amiable, and his Omnisciency makes
his Mercies more wonderful; so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109758:15"/>
doth the Exaltation of Christ, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
him to abate or diminish his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to any that serve him, according
to his divine Precepts.</p>
               <p>VII. BUT if in any method his Love
is mutable, it is by an Augmentation:
For when our blessed Lord was in the
flesh, you must have approached him
by Faith, or expected no Mercy; and
by Faith, though he is inthroned in
Heaven, you may obtain Mercy in
time of need. Thus you may ponder
upon any of these Considerations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
your Heart be so convinced of, and
affected with the Presence of God, that
you thereby may be the better fitted
for the carrying on the Duty of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
more effectually.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:109758:16"/>
LORD, my design, at this time, is
not to be sequestred an Hour from
worldly Enjoyments, for that were
to be guilty of a Cessation, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the number of my Sins, not my
Graces; but my Sollicitation, at this
time, is, to be so convinced and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with those spiritual Verities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in thy Sacred Word, that I may
fully resolve, by thy Strength and

is illuminated, yet without
thee my Affections cannot be enflamed:
I can neither know, resolve, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
any Good without thee; for
from thee proceeds both the Will and
the Benefit of thy good Pleasure. Lord,
I humbly implore <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to replenish me
with thy Grace, that I may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious

negligently, and inconsiderately. And,
Lord, do thou illuminate me, and
convince me with thy Sacred Truths,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109758:16"/>
and so affect my Heart with the Love
of Sanctity, and a Detestation of all
Sin and Wickedness, that I may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be fully and firmly resolv'd (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all the Oppositions that
the Flesh, the World, or the Devil
can procure) to run the ways of thy

               <p>III. AND, Lord, grant that when
thou hast operated in me the Will so

of my Resolutions. but to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
gracious Assistance of thy holy
Spirit for the Performance of those
Duties that through thee I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to pursue. Grant this, O holy
and blessed Father, even for the Merits
of thy dear Son, who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to approach to thee in
his Name for any Mercies I stand in

               </p>
               <p>IV. THIS or the like Prayer thou
art to send up to the Throne of Grace:
But this must be done with thy whole
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109758:17"/>
Heart; for thou must believe, that it
is by the Strength which thou shalt
acquire from God, by Prayer, whereby
thou shalt be enabled to perform this
or any other Duty profitably; for it is
he that teaches us to be Proficients.
Now, he that begins a holy Duty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God, will end it without him also.
It is a pernicious thing to imagine that
we can by our Natural Parts, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or by the strength of Grace already
received, without the Almighty's fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Assistance, perform any thing that
can please him, or edifie our own
Souls; for though our Mountain be
made strong, yet if he withdraws the
Light of his Countenance, we are in
Obscurity.</p>
               <p>V. WE may with much more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
declare, Now the Sun is in his full
Meridian, and the Air is so serene,
that now we can transact well enough
for a space, though that Solar Luminary
be eclipsed; than to testifie, though our
Hearts be never so much inflamed with
the Love of the Almighty, now we are
so supplied and inflamed with his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Love, we can subsist by our own
Strength, and for the present we want
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109758:17"/>
not God's further Assistance; afford us
but Subject Matter to meditate of, and
we shall be of Ability to continue and
encrease our Flames. Do not possess
thy self that it is a Burthen, but a
Mercy and Privilege, that Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
hath necessitated and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thee always to extract Strength
from Him.</p>

               <head>SECT. VII. Of Consideration.</head>
               <p>FIRST, Our Considerations must
be plain, not intricate and abstruse;
for the main Scope of Meditation being
the affecting of our Heart, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
of our Lives. Next, they
must be certain and evident, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversial
and dubious; for the Effect
of Meditation is not peculiarly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
our Knowledge, but to improve
it. Neither let Considerations be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and nice Speculations: Neither
make choise of those Books to assist
thee, in this Duty, which are embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
with Rhetorical and Eloquent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109758:18"/>
Expressions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which appear, in the eye
of the World, to be witty, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
very empty: for Verity, indeed,
is many times lost in those Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and entangles the Mind, by
disingaging of it, from serious Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:
As many Dishes become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury,
by having too much Cost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed,
and so lose their Vertue before
they reach the Stomach.</p>
               <p>II. THE Bee fixes not upon the
freshest coloured Rose, or fragrant's
Smell; but on the Herb Thime, which
is of slender beauty. Besides, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in this Duty, may please some
Persons, as Pictures in Books please
Children, who while they gaze upon
them, neglect their Learning; even
so, while we are affected with Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
of Speech, we stray from the
performance of conveying the Verity
of what we ponder of, to our Hearts:
As in the Disease of the Bladder, the
skilful Physician, to perform a Cure,
administers those Remedies which may
soonest reach the Part affected; for if
they meet with any Obstruction, they
lose their vertue, and are insignificant:
so if our Understanding should expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:109758:18"/>
the Eloquence, or search out the
Meaning or Certainty of the Verity it
considers, any long season, the Heart
will prove cool and unaffected; and
be under the same Circumstance with
those Musicianers that were to play
ther Consort before a great Emperour,
but were so long a Tuning their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments,
that he would not stay to
hear 'em.</p>
               <p>III. THE next Rule, is, If any
doubt ariseth upon an evident Truth,
in which the Devil is apt to cast in
Scruples; then act as the Arch-Angel
did with him, enter the Lists; and
perhaps when you have examined the
Matter, the Cloud may vanish, and the
Sun shine in its full Meridian; by
which resistance Satan will take flight:
but if he still persist, and your Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are not removed, then dispute no
more, but use the Arch-Angel's words,
<hi>The Lord rebuke thee, Satan.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
'tis requisite to be well grounded in
the Verity of God's Word, which is <hi>the
Sword of the Spirit,</hi> by which our Saviour
silenced Satan in all his Temptations:
We must not dispute with that Enemy
by Humane Reason, but we must <hi>put on
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109758:19"/>
the whole Armour of God,</hi> if we will be
able to stand in the Day of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and when all is done to stand.</p>
               <p>IV. OUR next Rule, is, Not to
over-multiply our Considerations; but
when, by considering the Truths of
God, we find our Hearts ardently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
then we are to make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.
But this Caution is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
That when we find our Hearts,
never so little affected, we must desist
in our Considerations: The Bee will
not leave the Flower, while any Honey
is to be extracted. And it is a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
which Christians ought to take
notice of, That Satan is ready to make
us hastily pass over Duties, before we
have extracted half the strength of
'em: For when we are confessing our
Sins, and our Hearts begin in the least
measure to be humbled, they are often
filled with such Joy, as may be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to proceed from him, or our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Hearts.</p>
               <p>V. CORN, when it springs too fast,
and grows rank, the Husbandman cuts
it down. A Corrosive applied to eat
dead Flesh, must not be removed when
it begins to smart: And Wheat in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109758:19"/>
stony Ground soonest springs up. Our
Considerations must take deep root,
and not entertain Affections and Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
when the Heart has newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
any Impression: But this we
must remember, that if our Affections
be much inflam'd when we begin our
Considerations, we are to yield to the
Inspirations of God, and be guided by
it: for this Method here proposed, is
not to limit the extraordinary Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of God's Spirit; but if our Hearts
be only a little excited, we must not
leave blowing the fire so soon as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to kindle; for green Wood will
suddenly extinguish, unless it be
throughly kindled.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="8" type="section">
               <head>SECT. VIII. Affections and Resolutions.</head>
               <p>WITHOUT Knowledge, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consider: and Consideration
raises Affections; and Affections pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
Resolutions; and the Effect of
Resolution is Action, and a through
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109758:20"/>
Reformation of our Lives and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
Now, our Affections may vary
according to the Subject of our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:
for sometimes we admire the
Goodness, Majesty and Wisdom of
the Almighty; another time we are
amazed at our own Folly and Madness,
in living so contrary to our own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
and that those sacred Truths
revealed in God's Word, which we
might improve to our Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
should be laid by, as useless; as
if one should have in his possession an
excellent and effectual Receipt for
the Stone, and yet lock it up, and
make no use of it.</p>
               <p>II. SOMETIMES we despise the
World, and with <hi>Iob,</hi> abhorr our selves
in Dust and Ashes: sometimes we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Sorrow, Joy, Love, Fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which
we may be furnish'd out of the Book
of <hi>Psalms,</hi> which were indeed but <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
Meditations, though not in this
Method. Now, when our Affections
are much excited, we may make a
progress to Resolution.</p>
               <p>III. NOW your Resolutions must
be fixed; not vain and frivolous, but
serious and resolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Purposes. Say not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109758:20"/>
with thy self, I am assured the Wrath
of God comes upon the <hi>Children of
Disobedience,</hi> and I must embrace Hell,
or forsake taking of the Name of God
in vain; the Offence is great, which
I commit in Swearing, and I could hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
wish I could omit it: but instead
of this, argue thus with thy self, I am
solemnly resolv'd, by the Blessing of
the Almighty, to forsake all Sin, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
what I am most guilty of; for
God will not be mocked, neither must
I give a faint denial to Sin.</p>
               <p>IV. WHATEVER thy Resolutions
are, put them presently in practise,
and drive them not off to futurity.
Art thou addicted to Drinking? Do
not resolve and say, This Sin I intend
to forsake, but for the present I am
engag'd to meet Company where I
must appear sociable; but that being
finish'd, I design to prosecute my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.
This is one of Satan's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
and is cast in thy way as a
Stumbling-block, which, if not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
will prove pernicious.</p>
               <p>V. NEXT, Let not thy Resolutions
be only against Sin, but against the
Temptations and Allurements to it.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109758:21"/>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not say to the Adulterer,
Thou may'st discourse a Harlot; but,
<hi>Be not enticed by her words to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
He will not permit thee to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her House, or by her Door; <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 8.
And when he disswadeth the Drunkard
from that Vice, he advises him not to
<hi>look</hi> upon the Wine; for as the Beauty
of a prostitute Harlot, so the Colour
of Wine will inflame our Desires after
it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 31. After this method
<hi>Iob</hi> resolv'd, <hi>I have made a covenant
with mine eyes, why then should I look
upon a maid?</hi> Job. 31. 1.</p>
               <p>VI. NEXT, You must observe this
Caution: If you find your Heart ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so much resolving against, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
of any Sin, yet be very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
that you confide not upon the
strength of Resolution, but earnestly
deprecate the Almighty, that he would
enable you by his Divine Power; and
that as he has given you the Will, so
he would give you his Grace to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="9" type="section">
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:109758:21"/>
               <head>SECT. IX. Of Vows.</head>
               <p>AS your Resolutios are, so let your
Vows be; rather against the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of Sin, than against Sin it self.
In things Indifferent beware of making
any Perpetual Vow, but rather let it
be Conditional. As, First, That you
will abstain from such a thing, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what you design'd, unless you
shall be otherwise advised by some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screet,
sober Person. Secondly, Add
this Caution, if thou art guilty of
Drinking, <hi>viz.</hi> If I think of it, I will
not drink Wine this Month. Now, if
a Breach of this Vow be made, though
you did not think of it, you sin if your
Vow be absolute.</p>
               <p>II. THE next Caution concerning
Things Indifferent, is this; Add a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
upon the Breach o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> your Vow;
which may be to this purpose: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to set a-part one Hour in the Day,
in Prayer for the Church, to the End
of this Month; or else give Alms to
the Poor. In such a case, if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109758:22"/>
either, we sin not: And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of our Penalty, is, because some
Inconveniences may arise which may
prove very prejudicial to us; and then
we have liberty to take the other part
of our Vow, <hi>viz.</hi> To give so much to
the Poor.</p>
               <p>III. NOW, this Penalty we inflict
upon our selves, must not be too light
and trivial, but of such consequence as
may be obligatory; yet not of that
ponderosity to be prejudicial. For a
rich Man to vow he will bestow a small
Matter on the Poor, is inconsiderable;
yet, perhaps, by a poor Man, the same
Value may be of too large an extent:
But let your Penalty be according to
the Rules of Scripture and Reason,
and opposite to those Sins which are
most prevalent in thee. For Example,
If Covetousness reigns in thee, exercise
thy Penalty in Alms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If Voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Prayer and Fasting, or abstaining
wholly, for a time, from thy greatest
Delight and Recreation.</p>
               <p>IV. LASTLY, Let your Vows be
rather against the External than the
Internal Acts of Sin; rather against
Speaking angrily, than being Angry:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109758:22"/>
For though External Acts of Sin are
worse, yet we have not so much do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over them. If your Vows ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the Performance of Holy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
let it be as to the Time, not the
Quantity. For Example: Should'st
thou bind thy self to read such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Chapters, perhaps thou art
tempted to read them too hastily over;
whereas if thou dost allot thy self so
much Time, thou art not so liable to
this Temptation.</p>

               <p>FIRST, Thou must earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
the Almighty to give thee
Strength to perform whatever thou
hast resolv'd to act in his Service. This
must be perform'd fervently, though
briefly and humbly, from an earnest

               <p>OMNIPOTENT God, my
Sins ever appear in my sight,
and are a Torment unto my
Mind; every Day I think of thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
because Death threatens me
every Hour. And when I remember,
<hi>I must appear before the Iudgment-seat
of Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. then I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
my whole Life, and find it is
altogether Vanity; my Actions are
vain, my Words profane, and my
Thoughts unprofitable. If the shadow
of some Vertue appears, it is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
because Original Sin, and my
vitiated Nature hath polluted it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:109758:24"/>
II. IF <hi>all our righteousness are as
filthy rags,</hi> Isa. 64. 6. what can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
our Unrighteousness should be?
Our Saviour tells us, <hi>When ye shall have
done all those things which are commanded
you,</hi> say, <hi>we are unprofitable servants,</hi>
Luk. 17. 10. And if we are so unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
in our Acts of Obedience, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
we are abominable in our Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.
St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> in his <hi>Morals,</hi>
tells us, A diminutive Light may shine
in Obscurity; but being set in the Sun,
is darken'd. Wood not measured, may
appear strait; but applied to the Rule,
is found oblique. The Impress of a
Seal may appear perfect in the Eyes of
the Spectators, and yet be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
in the Eye of the Artificer. So
that which glitters in the Estimation
of the Performer, is often-times sordid
in the Discretion of the Judger. For,
the Thoughts of God are different from
the Thoughts of Men, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 8.</p>
               <p>III. THE Memory of many Sins
affrights me; and yet there are divers
I am ignorant of. <hi>Who can tell how oft
he offendeth? O cleanse thou me from my
secret faults!</hi> Psal. 19. 12. I dare not
look up to Heaven, because I have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109758:25"/>
offended him which inhabits there. In
Earth I enjoy no Refuge, expecting
nothing from the Creatures, because I
have offended the Lord of the Universe.
My Adversary the Devil accuseth me to
the Almighty, and desires him the most
Just Judge to condemn me to Chains
of Darkness, for my Sin, that would
not lay hold on the Means of Grace.</p>
               <p>IV. NEXT, The Four Elements,
in their order, accuse me: And, First,
The Heavens acquaint me, they have
supplied me with Light, to my Joy and
Comfort. The Air whispers me, I have
given thee all manner of Fowl my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
affords, to be at thy Command.
The Water violently speaks, I have
given thee all manner of Fish to eat.
And the Earth opens her Mouth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I have given thee Corn, Wine and
Oyl to nourish thee; but how hast
thou abused these Mercies, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and Dishonour of our Creation?
Therefore let our Benefits redound to
thy Punishment; let the Fire consume
thee, the Water overwhelm thee, the
Air fann and winnow thee, the Earth
swallow thee up, and Hell devour
thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:109758:25"/>
V. THE Holy Angels which were
appointed by the Almighty to minister
unto me in this Life, and to be my
Comforts in the Life to come, they
accuse me: for by my Sins I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
my self of their Ministry in this
Life, and Hope of their Fellowship in
the World to come; the Voice of
God's Divine Law accuses me; either
I must fulfil it, or perish; to perform
the one, is impossible; and to undergo
the other, is intollerable.</p>
               <p>VI. GOD, the most severe Judge,
and potentest Executer of his Eternal
Law, accuses me: Him I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
who is Wisdom it self; from
him I cannot fly, who is Power it self,
and reigns every where. <hi>Whither then
shall I fly?</hi> Psal. 139. 7. Even to thee,
O Blessed Jesu, my alone Redeemer
and Saviour. I hear a Voice which
bids me hide my self <hi>in the clifts of the
rock,</hi> Cant. 2. 14. Thou art that Rock,
and thy Wounds are the Clefts; in
them will I hide my self against the
Accusations of all the Creatures.</p>
               <p>VII. My Sins cry aloud, even unto
Heaven; but <hi>thy blood which was poured
forth for my sins, cryes louder,</hi> Heb. 12. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

My Sins are potent to Accuse me, but
thy Passion is effectual to Defend me;
the Unrighteousness of my Life is
powerful to Condemn me, but thy
most perfect Righteousness is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller

from the Throne of thy Justice, to thy

in the highest Heavens, underwent all
this for lost Mankind: He felt the
Pains of Hell, and cry'd out, <hi>My God!
My God! Why hast thou forsaken me?</hi>
Mat. 27. 46. So great was his Agony
and Anguish, that he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109758:27"/>
Angels, stood now in need of
one to comfort him.</p>
               <p>III. IF this happens to the Just,
what shall become of wretched Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?
What measure shall the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
take with us for our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
who is so wrathfully displeased
with his well-beloved Son for the Sins
of the whole World? O God of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Mercy, take from us these stony
Hearts of ours, and give us Hearts of
Flesh, that we may tremble at thy
Word, and melt at thy Judgments.
Lord, let us not forget thy Acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Tears: Thou cryedst from
the Cross, Behold, O ye Sons and
Daughters of Men, what I suffer for
you! Was ever Grief so great? or
any Sorrow like unto my Sorrow?
But O Thou whose Property it is to
have Mercy, convert our stubborn
Hearts unto Thee.</p>

               <head>MED. III. Of the Fruits of Repentance.</head>
               <epigraph>

                  <q type="sub">Bring forth therefore fruits
meet for repentance.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THE Foundation of a Holy Life, is
True Repentance; and where
that is acquired, Remission of Sins,
and Eternal Life succeeds. Why then
do we deferr our Repentance, and
procrastinate it from day to day? To
Morrow is not in our possession; and
to Repent sincerely, is not in our
power; but when the Judgment-Day
is approach'd, we must render an
Account not only for one Day, but
for our whole Lives.</p>
               <p>II. ACKNOWLEDGE and bewail
thy Sins, so shalt thou find God in
Christ appeased towards thee. <hi>I, even
I am he that blotteth out thy transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi>
saith the Lord, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 25. infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
our Sins are enrolled in the Court
of Heaven. <hi>Turn away thy face from
my sins,</hi> begs the Royal Prophet,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 9. Demonstating that our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109758:28"/>
Iniquities are in God's sight. <hi>Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
unto us, O God,</hi> prayeth <hi>Moses:</hi>
therefore <hi>our sins do separate us from
God,</hi> Isa. 59. 2. <hi>Our sins have answered us,</hi>
complaineth <hi>Isaiah,</hi> ver. 12. and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
us before God's Tribunal. <hi>Cleanse
me from my sins,</hi> is the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 2. Concluding, our
Sins, in appearance, are sordid in the
Eye of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>III. SIN is the Distemper of the
Soul: which moved <hi>David</hi> to cry out,
<hi>Heal my soul, for I have sinned against
thee,</hi> Psal. 41. 4. It is for Sin, that we
are blotted out of the Book of Life.
So said the Eternal, Whosoever shall
sin against me, <hi>I will blot him out of my
book,</hi> Exod. 32. 32. We are cast off
by the Almighty for our Sins: which
made <hi>David</hi> deprecate, <hi>Cast me not
away from thy presence,</hi> Psal. 51. 11.
Sin torments the Mind, and dries up
the Moisture, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd,
<hi>Restore me to the joy of thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
Psal. 47. 12.</p>
               <p>IV. Sin is infectious, says the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Prphet,
<hi>Isa. 24. 5. The earth is defiled
by the inhabitants thereof, which have
transgressed the law.</hi> Our Sins press us
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109758:28"/>
down to Hell, else the <hi>Psalmist</hi> had
not broke out, saying, <hi>Out of the deep
have I cried to thee, O Lord; Lord, hear
my voice.</hi> 130. 1. Sin is the spiritual
Death of the Soul. So says the Apostle,
We were sometimes <hi>dead in our sins,</hi>
Ephes. 2. 1. By mortal Sin, Man
loseth his Creator, who is the infinite
and Incomprehensible Good: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to be deprived of him, is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and incomprehensible Evil. And
as the Almighty is the chiefest Good,
so Sin is the chiefest Evil.</p>
               <p>V. CALAMITIES and Punishments
are not absolutely Evil; for many
times from them Good is extracted:
Nay, they may properly be called
Good; because they are God's Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
and proceed from him who
is the Fountain of all Goodness. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
they lead us unto the chiefest
Good, even Life Everlasting. Christ,
by his <hi>Passion, entered into his Glory,</hi>
Luk. 24. 26. And Christians, by <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations,
enter into Life Eternal,</hi>
Act. 14. 22. And consequently, Sin
is the chiefest Evil, because it draws us
from the chiefest Good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:109758:29"/>
VI. THE Sinner is accused by his
Conscience, which he hath defiled;
by his Creator, whom he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
by the Sins he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
by the Creatures he hath abused;
and by the Devil, who hath seduced
him. How saving then is Repentance,
which frees us from such Accusations!
Let us haste then with speed to such a
soveraign Catholicon. If thou deferr
thy Repentance till Death, thou do'st
not forsake thy Sins, but they forsake
thee; and it is very difficult to trace
out an Example of sincere Repentance
at the Hour of Death, except that of
the Thief upon the Cross.</p>
               <p>VII. <hi>FOVRTEEN years have I
served thee,</hi> (said <hi>Iacob</hi> to <hi>Laban,</hi>) <hi>it is
time now that I should provide for my
own house,</hi> Gen. 31. 41. And if thou
hast pursued the World, and chased
after the Vanities of it so many Years,
it is now high time to provide for thy
Soul. Every Day, nay, every Hour
and Minute, we accumulate Sin; Oh,
let the Spirit, every Moment, wash it
away with Tears of Repentance. The
Almighty infuses not the Oyl of
Mercy, but into the Vessel of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109758:29"/>
Heart: He first mortifies us by
Contrition, and then quickens us by
his Spirit of Consolation: He leads us
into a deep abyss of Grief, and brings
us back by his Restraining Grace.</p>
               <p>VIII. <hi>Elias</hi> first heard a vehement
Wind, overturning Mountains, and
cleaving Rocks; and after the Wind,
an Earthquake; and after the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,
Fire, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 11. At length
there followed a still, small Voice,
<hi>ver.</hi> 12. From whence we may inferr,
That Terrour is the precursor of the
Love of Omnipotency, and Sorrow
precedes Comfort. God binds not up
any Wounds that are laid open by
Confession: He Pardons and Justifies
none, except they Acknowledge and
Condemn themselves: He Comforts
not, unless they first Despond. And
this is the sincere Repentance which
God, by his Holy Spirit, operates
in us.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>WHY art thou perplexed, O my
Soul? and why art thou dubious
of the Mercy of God? Remember
thy Creator, who created thee without
thy Assistance; who <hi>formed thee in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
in the lower parts of the earth,</hi>
Psal. 139. 15. He who took care of
thee before thou wer't born: Will his
Providence neglect thee, now thou art
fashioned after his own Image? To
Thee, the Great Creator, does thy
unworthy Creature address himself:
Though my Nature is infected by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and wounded by Thieves, which
are my sinful Corruptions; yet my
Creator liveth.</p>
               <p>II. HE which made me, can renew
me: He that created me without any
Evil, can chase all Evil from me; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hath gain'd admittance by the
Devil's Suggestions, <hi>Adam</hi>'s Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109758:30"/>
or my own Actions; yea, though
it hath over-spread my whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
The Almighty never hated
his own Workmanship: We are before
him, like Clay in the Hands of the
Potter. Had he hated me, certainly
he would never have created me when
I was nothing: <hi>He is the Saviour of
all men, but especially of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
1 Tim. 3. 10. He created me
wonderfully, and redeemed me mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously;
but his Love was never so
highly expressed, than in his Wounds
and Passion.</p>
               <p>III. SURELY we were indulgently
belov'd, for whose sakes the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Son of God is sent from the
Bosom of his Father. Dear was the
Price of our Redemption, and great
was the Mercy of our Redeemer: To
make us Rich, he embraced Poverty;
for he <hi>had not where to lay his head,</hi>
Mat. 8. 20. To make us the Sons of
the Most High, he condescends to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Man; and doth not, after he had
accomplish'd our Redemption, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
us, but <hi>still intercedeth for us,</hi>
Rom. 8. 34.</p>
               <p>IV. LET my Sins, Satan, and all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109758:31"/>
the Powers of Darkness accuse me, in
Jesus my Mediator will I trust, who is
Greater than my Accusers. Let my
Weakness affright me, yet in his
Strength will I glory. For the Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
of my Merit I am familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted,
my Merits is not sufficient;
it suffices me, that he is propitious
against whom I have sinned; and
whatsoever he hath decreed not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
will be perform'd; and all Guilt,
with the Price of his most precious
Blood, shall be done away.</p>
               <p>V. LET it not then perplex me,
that my Sins, though many, and of
such a magnitud<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> discomfort me:
For were I not oppress'd, and heavy
laden with Sins, what need I earnestly
request Christ's Righteousness? Had
I no Distemper, I had no necessity to
implore the Physician's Help: but I
am spiritually sick; and He who is the
Lord our Righteousness, is both our
Saviour and Physician. Lord, I am
Sick, a Sinner, and Condemned; and
upon the Grand Inquest of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,

in the days of thy youth.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IT was both seasonable and profitable
Advice, and one of the elegantest
and choicest Expressions in the Royal
Preacher's Sermon. For, who is he
which is now Young and Vigorous,
that is certain he shall live to be Old?
And yet that potent Voice which
loudly proclaims to all the World,
and whose Sound will remain till Death
shall be expired, is scarce aucible in the
Ears of thousands.</p>
               <p>II. 'TIS one of this divine Chanters
harmonious Lessons; and yet the
World thinks it too harsh a Note, and
is very much displeased with the
Tune. 'Tis strange, and an amazing
Wonder, That the Sweetest and Wisest
of Preachers should have so slender a
Train of Followers, being his Oratory
is so Rhetorical and Divine: And yet
it is so weighty a Text, which though
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109758:32"/>
they shun to hear, understand, or
read, they cannot evade the seeing;
for the whole Universe is but a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on it; every Creature we behold,
preaches this useful Doctrine, which
we so supinely sleep out with our Eyes
open.</p>
               <p>III. NATURE her self carries this
<hi>Memento</hi> in her Forehead; and the
very Bruit Beasts, in this Philosophy,
can reason with us: And it is strange
madness, that Man should forget his
Maker, did he but remember himself.
But alas, blooming Youth affects not
to be put in mind of Heaven, which
he is not acquainted with; 'twould
impair his Memory, and make him
think of his Prayers too often: Piety
will but chill his Blood; Religion
makes him look wither'd; the
Thoughts of Heaven, and a Future-State,
will make him sager than his
years requires: his Blood informs him,
he is not yet qualified to turn Divine;
he may serve his Creator time enough,
when he is more at leisure.</p>
               <p>IV. THUS these Temporal Objects
of Vanity and Pleasure chase away
our Thoughts from Heaven, and its
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109758:32"/>
Celestial Raptures: We can spend the
Flower and Beauty of our Years in
Vice, and think the Almighty will be
well enough pleas'd with the Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of decrepit Age: We can sport
and revel our Piety and Time in vain
and frivolous Delights, and conclude
our selves potent enough to compel
Heaven, and become Religious, when
we are bowed down with Infirmities,
and have nothing left us but Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and a Tomb.</p>
               <p>V. WE are so highly pleas'd with
the Sweetness of Sense, that we are
negligent of any greater Felicity; and
so extraordinary much delighted with
the Happiness of Sinning freely, that
we could willingly embrace that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which tolerates Vice most: We
place all our Devotion, with the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Epicure, in the Riots of Nature:
Jolly Meetings are our best Religious
Exercises; a Sermon is as troublesom
and melancholy to us, as a Funeral;
and to hear of our Latter-end in the
mid'st of our Pleasures, sounds like a
Lecture of Death, the unwelcome and
faint Eccho of the Grave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:109758:33"/>
VI. LET the Preacher instruct us
never so earnestly to remember our
Creator, we rather chuse to follow Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's
Doctrine, to enjoy this World
as long as we can, and entertain
Thoughts of Heaven at our leisure.
And shall the Lusts of this vain World,
O Lord, be greater in my Soul than
the Love of Thee? Shall the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
Allurements of Sin eclipse the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of thy Glory? My Life, I know,
is but a Span; and yet, I beseech thee,
abreviate that, rather than it shoud be
spent in a neglect of Thee: better this
Earthly Tabernacle of my Body be
dissolv'd, than become a Theatre for
Sin to revel in.</p>
               <p>VII. LET me pay unto Nature the
due Debt I owe her, sooner than per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
she would summons it, rather
than run deeper in score with thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
'Tis far better I should die, and
be lost in the memory of the World,
than to forget thee: Thou broughtest
me, at first, from nothing, not to sin,
but to serve and fear Thee; and has
impressed in me a Ray of thy blessed
Self, that I might not seek my own
perverse Will, nor pursue this vain
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109758:33"/>
World, but heavenly Mansions: inure
me therefore to Thee, that I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
those solid and ravishing Joys and
Consolations that is in serving of Thee;
what Tranquility accompanies thy
Grace; that so I may no longer follow
my own depraved Sense, but my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>VIII. IT is none of the least Sins of
our Youth, that we are negligent and
forgetful of Thee our Creator. And
no wonder we are ignorant and insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of the Joys to come, that live in
such a constant and continued neglect
of Heaven. Make me therefore, O my
God, seriously to consider, that had I
the perfect Fruition of all I could wish
or long for here, I should not only be
unsatisfied, but, in the end, find how
miserable he is that fixeth his Heart on
any thing but Thy Self. Teach me
therefore so to enjoy the World, that
I lose not Thee, nor the Memory of
that Blessed and Eternal Reward Thou
hast promised to them that Honour and
Fear Thee.</p>

are evil.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>EVERY Day Death approaches
thee, and then follows Judgment
and Eternity. Therefore, think often
how thou may'st be able to Answer,
in that most strict and severe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Look circumspectly unto thy
Thoughts, Words, and Actions; for
at that great Tribunal thou must ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
up an exact Account, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 14.
Every Evening and Morning entertain
thy Thoughts of the pale Messenger,
and deferr not thy Repentance till the
next Day; for the Morrow is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
but Death is certain, and waits
no Person's leisure.</p>
               <p>II. NOTHING is more opposite to
Piety than Procrastination. If thou
contemnest the inward Voice of the
Holy Spirit, thou will never attain to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:109758:34"/>
a sincere Repentance. Make it thy
business and study to walk in the Law
of the Lord. In thy Conversation be
Affable and Courteous to all, Perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to none, and Familiar with few:
To God live Piously, to thy self Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently,
and to thy Neighbour Justly:
Shew Favour to thy Friend, Patience
to thy Enemy, thy Good-Will towards
all, and thy Bounty to whom thou
art able. Always call to mind Three
things past, the Evil committed, the
Good omitted, and the Time pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And ever bear in mind Three things
present, the Brevity of this present
Life, the Difficulty of being saved, and
the Paucity of them that shall be
saved.</p>
               <p>III. LET thy Evening Prayers
ascend, and humbly confess the Sins
of the Day past, and think how many
are in danger of Hell-fire. Let the last
Day of the Seven correct and amend
what Enormities thou hast committed
the whole Week: Shew Obedience to
thy Superiours, give Counsel and Aid
to thy Equals, and Defend and Instruct
thy Inferiours: Subdue thy Body to
thy Mind, and thy Mind to the Will
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109758:35"/>
of God: Heartily bewail thy past E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and set not thy Affections on
Temporal Enjoyments, but fix them
on that which is Eternal: Mourn for
Sins, upon remembrance of them;
and often remember Death, that thou
may'st cease from Sin: Let the Justice
of the Almighty keep thee in Fear,
and his Mercy preserve thee from De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair.</p>
               <p>IV. WITHDRAW thy self, as much
as thou can'st, from the World, and
addict thy self wholly to God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
In Pleasures and Delights, be
vigilant of thy Chastity; in Riches,
exercise thy Humility; and in worldly
Affairs, neglect not Piety: Be stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
in pleasing none but thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
neither fear to displease any but
Him: Deprecate Him always, that his
Will may be done on Earth, as it is in
Heaven; and beseech Him to forgive
thee what is past, and to guide and
govern what he has wrought in thee,
for the future.</p>
               <p>V. ABANDON all Hypocrisie; for
God judgeth not according to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
appearance, but according to the
Heart. In thy Words, <hi>take heed of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109758:35"/>
vain repetitions,</hi> Mat. 6. 7. because <hi>for
every idle word thou must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in the day of judgment,</hi> Mat. 12. 36.
Let thy Words, Works, and Actions,
be good or evil, they pass not away,
but remain as Seeds of Eternity. And
the Apostle assures us, <hi>If thou sowest
to thy flesh, of the flesh thou shalt reap
corruption; but if thou sowest to the
spirit, of the spirit thou shalt reap life
everlasting,</hi> Gal. 6. 8. Neither Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
Riches, Pleasures, or Vanities
of this Life, can attend thee, after thy
Glass is run out. Set a low value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what thou possesseth, but esteem
highly what thou wantest.</p>
               <p>VI. LET Holy Meditation produce
in thee Knowledge; and Knowledge,
Compunction; and Compunction, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Devotion. The Silence of the
Mouth creates Peace in the Heart;
and, and the more thou separates thy
self from the World, the more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
thou art to the Almighty. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thou requestest, ask it of God;
and whatsoever thou enjoyest, resign
up freely unto him: for he that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
for what he has received, is
unworthy of receiving more; and the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109758:36"/>
Gifts of Heaven cease to descend, when
the Incense of our Thanks leave off
ascending.</p>
               <p>VII. WHATEVER happeneth to
thee, convert it to a good use; as in
Prosperity, bless and praise God, and
exercise Charity according to thy Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
So in Adversity, exercise thy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for what Enormities thou
hast committed, which thou can'st not
but imagine to be the Efficient Cause
of what thou sufferest. Let Humility
keep thy Heart in Subjection, that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy
may get no possession of thee.
Judge God to be a Father, for his Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
Power, and Gentleness; a
Lord, for his Discipline, Severity, and
Justice. Love him piously, as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for his Mercy; and fear him,
and trust in him, who abhors Sin in
the least degree. Ever humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

               <head>MED. VII. The Whole Duty of Man.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Eccles. xii. 13.</bibl>
                  <q> Fear God, and keep his
commandments, for this is the Whole
duty of man.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>FEW there are which perform this
Lesson; which yet should not so
much appear our Duty, as it ought
to be our Delectation. He that hath
but once acquired the habit of adoring
his Maker, will assideouslsly confess
Religion the highest of Pleasures; and
that Legislative Power which seems
so formidable and disgustful to the
World, will prove but recreative to
his Immortal Soul. But alas, how
little is there of the Royal Prophet's
Piety now among us, when instead of
delighting in God's Law, we obliterate
it more; and are so far distant from
meditating in it either Day or Night,
that we never in the least think or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of it at all.</p>
               <p>II. 'TIS become a Custom, now, to
Sin with Audacity; and a Syllogism of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109758:37"/>
much Valour, to exile this timerous
Religion, or fearing either the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
or his Law, which he hath
given us. The Royal Preachers edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Doctrine is as obsolete, and worser
than a Paradox; a meer Apocrypha,
and a Heresie to revive it. To instruct
us in our Duty, is to scurrilize the
Times, whil'st we officiously unhinge
Religion; and it is no amazing won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
there are such swarms of Atheists:
but indeed, there never was such a time
to generate them, as now; trace Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
to its primitive Rise, and this
Age cannot be parallell'd.</p>
               <p>III. THE World never encreased so
much in Sin: abominable Sects, and
disaffected Parties, like Colonies, new
cultivate the Earth; Profaneness is
grown Hereditary, and sprouts out by
Propagation; so that in process of
time, Posterity may perhaps become
Ethnicks. Were the Divine Wisdom
and his Promise mutable, a Deluge
would prove but a slender Penalty.
We not only sin, but exult in it more;
whil'st some, not satisfy'd to be occult
and silent Atheists, proclaim it aloud,
and are fierce of acquiring the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:109758:37"/>
as if we could not render our
Ingenuity enough, without Denying
our Maker.</p>
               <p>IV. NO marvel Religion is out of
Tune, when a Harmony in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticks
is wanting; or that Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
bears so faint a Sound, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Morality is not heard. And yet
it is a Lesson which we cannot learn
too well, a Tribute we cannot pay too
often. We owe our Breath to the
Bounty of his Hand; what Homage
then can we better pay than that,
which by magnifying of him, we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
an Immortal Crown for our
selves? Tell me, ye stupid Chasers of
the World, what ye aim at in all your
Pretences? Ye that scoff at Heaven,
and make Divinity a Garment for Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness?
That with the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee,
embrace Formality for your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and make an external Piety
your Duty?</p>
               <p>V. ALAS, Heaven is not gain'd by
pious Fraudulency, gilded Crimes, or
fortunate Transgressions; nor the Eye
of the Almigty to be deluded with a
gaudy Zeal. 'Tis not a pretended San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,
that can invest us with Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109758:38"/>
nor a modish Devotion only, that
will conduct us to Heaven. How mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
is he who idolizes the World,
and embraces that Religion, to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
his Creator! Therefore let us
make that inquest of the Voice within
us, and then invoke the Almghty in
these or the like Expressions.</p>
               <p>VI. <q>O GREAT <hi>Iehovah,</hi> what
did'st thou bestow our Reason on us,
but to diligently listen unto the Voice
of thy Law, that the Celestial Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick
of thy Word, might at least
attract from us an ignorant Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?
Shall Ethnicks, that had no
other Scope, no other Recompence
for their Sanctity, than some vain
Applause, or the internal Triumphs
of their Spirits, for their good Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
outvie us in the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
of a Moral Life; and we that
have sublimer and purer Hopes, be
scarce Obedient for Thy sake? Shall
they that are ignorant of Thee, be
more passionately Just, than we that
have traced out Heaven, and expect
Eternity to succeed?</q>
               </p>
               <p>VII. <q>THOUGH it was not in
Man's Power to find Thee, till Thou
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:109758:38"/>
did'st reveal Thy Self in a Crucify'd
Jesus; yet now having so richly, and
in that Plenitude expressed to us the
Treasures of Thy Love, shall we not
be excited to perform something for
Thy Glory? Incite us, we beseech
Thee, to consider well the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
that are in Thy Service, the
Felicity that accompanies Obedience,
and thae Crown which is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
of Faith; that so our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
being mortified unto these
fading Objects here Below, they
may be enliven'd only with Desires
after those Eternal Excellencies that
are in Thee, in Thy Heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</q>

is subject to Vanity: whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

VVhy doth mundane, ambitious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

               <p>II. HE that is Extoll'd yesterday,
perhaps, to a high degree, by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauses
of Men, may be levell'd to
morrow by Dis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>race. VVhat is mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Man the better, for gaining a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of a greater value than others,
if he is disesteem'd in the sight of God?
Our blessed Saviour being sought for
to receive a Kingdom, fled from it;
but to be ignominiously Crucified, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered
himself. He that despises not
the VVorld, to follow Christ, how
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109758:39"/>
will he be qualify'd to lay down his
Life for him? Therefore there is no
passage to true Happiness, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
the Pomps and Vanities of
this wicked and fading World.</p>
               <p>III. CHRIST, that blessed Pattern,
taught us how we should value the
World: For, if He who is Glory it
self, rejected Temporal Glory, why
should we, to our prejudice, embrace
it? What availeth the Praises of Men,
if the Voice within accuseth us? Or,
what signifies a Bed of Gold, to one in
a burning Fever, unless the State or
Pomp could abate the Torment? It is
only the Testimony of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that admits of any Duration.
But why do'st thou chase so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Riches? He is too covetous, unto
whom the Almighty is not sufficient.
This Life is the Path to our Eternal
Countrey. What doth transitory things
profit us: They do but rather over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load
the Traveller, as too much Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
doth a Ship.</p>
               <p>IV. THE Majesty of Heaven is the
Riches of his Servants; then why
should'st thou not seek after that which
will compleat thy Happiness? Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109758:40"/>
Riches produce Labour and Toil
in the getting, Fear in the possessing,
and Grief in the losing: and, which is
most deplorable, the Labour of the
Covetous not only perisheth, but it
brings them also to the same Destiny.
<hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, which was turn'd into a
Pillar of Salt, yet preaches unto us
this Doctrine, Not to look back on
the Splendour of the World, but with
speed to hasten to our heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
And why do'st thou so eagerly
pursue after Pleasures? They are but
Vanity, and in the end, <hi>Vexation of
Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. O THEN, let the remembrance
of a Crucified Saviour, banish from thee
all Pleasures; and let the remembrance
of a Fire Unquenchable, extinguish all
inordinate Concupiscence. Compare
but the short Moments of Pleasure
with Eternal Punishments, and thou
wilt relinquish one to evade the other.
Worldly Pleasures, if really considered,
are brutish; and they that are involved
in those Allurements, assume the shape
of wild Salvages. The Sweetness of
Heavens Kingdom pleases not that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
which daily feeds upon Husk
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109758:40"/>
with Swine. Let us then prepare,
with the Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> and offer
up to the Almighty, as an Oblation,
this our beloved Son, even our darling
Sins which have so long invaded us.</p>
               <p>VI. LET us consider, the Way to
Eternal Mansions, is not strewed with
fragrant Roses, but with Thorns and
Thistles. The External Man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
is surrounded with Pleasures;
but the Internal must press through
many Tribulations. Let the Fear
of Omnipotency then, macerate thy
Flesh, that the Affections thereof
may not delude thee. Retain always
in mind the approach of the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
that the perverse Judgment of thy
sensual Appetite may no way enslave
thee. Be not allured by the flattering
Face of the Serpent, but remember the
Sting he craftily conceals. Always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
the Almighty to strengthen thee
with his Grace, that at the last thou
may'st receive a Crown of Glory.</p>

               <p>THE Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> had no sooner
fixed upon a Stone for his Pillow,

That filial Obedience which attended
him from his Father, on a Journey to
<hi>Syria,</hi> became a nobler Conduct, and
directed him the Way to Heaven:
Those Angelical Travellers ascending
and descending before him: Happy
Solitariness, and glorious Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

The Uneasiness of his Lodging was

Prospect; when the God of Heaven,
the Lord and Governour of the World,
appeared unto him, refreshing him
with the graciousness of his Promises
and Providence.</p>

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:109758:41"/>
II. WHEN I view the Figure of
this humble Sleeper, I cannot forbear
wondring at the folly of those, that
expect Visions from Above upon their
soft Beds, and seek for Revelation in
the plenitude of their Pleasures: Their
wanton Spirits would wax sick, and be
out of humour with Piety, should it
molest or oppose their Quiet: How
apt would their Devotion be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
an Ague, should they, with the
Psalmist, rise up at Midnight to invoke
the Almighty? God distills not his
Miracles into the Lap of the Wanton;
nor communicats the Excellency of
his Glory, but to those who resign
themselves to Him.</p>
               <p>III. St. <hi>IOHN</hi> must be exil'd to
<hi>Patmos,</hi> before he can be admitted a
Divine; and have converse with none
but Angels, if he would be a fit Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
for Heaven. Those devout Men,
who were retir'd from all Company,
but Solitude, and their Devotions,
could not have merchandized so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
with Heaven, had they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
all Correspondence with the
World; and unvesting themselves of all
Temporal Felicities, obtained an higher
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109758:42"/>
degree of Grace, and became living
Monuments of Celestial Grandeur.</p>
               <p>IV. OUR devout Patriarch enjoyed
here no-Canopy but the serene Air; no
other Tapers to illuminate his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but the Lamps celestial; and
the vigilant Angels move to and fro,
as it were, to guard and preserve him.
Oh, how securely doth he rest, that
lays down his Head in the Bosom of
Providence, and makes that his Soul's
Receptacle! Repose thus Beatifical,
denotes a Sanctuary: Nor need he fear
any Disturbance in his Rest, that has
the Almighty for his Keeper; or that
his pious nocturnal Thoughts shall be
molested with frightful Dreams.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>IACOB</hi> had no sooner prepared
to sleep, but those holy Messengers
unlock the Heavens, and invite him
to ascend. But 'tis by a Ladder. Heaven
is not to be clim'd up to in a moment:
The Path to Happiness is trod by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
and, as our Saviour informs us,
'tis very <hi>narrow.</hi> Every Vertue is a
step to Eternity; and he is so much
onward of his Journey, that daily
tramples upon his Vices. We cannot
prove too good Proficients in a Life of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109758:42"/>
Sanctity, or imagine that in the least
Acts of Piety we have enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
us to Happiness. 'Tis not a few
Paces, but a constant Progress, that
conveys us thither. Oh, how bad then
is he, that thinks himself too good to
be made better!</p>
               <p>VI. <q>O LORD, the Promises of
Thy Glory are immensible; and yet
how negligently do we embrace'em!
Thou hast directed us the Way unto
Thy Self, and yet we are not only
reluctant, but even weary of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Thee! Alas, Is the Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of Thy Kingdom not worth
approaching to? Can we propose
to ascend Thy Throne by a feeble
and dronish Devotion? How actively
do we run after the Vanities of the
World, but in Thy Service pretend
faintness? We can chase after the
fading Pleasures of this Temporal
Life, but neglect our progress in the
Way Thou prescribest us to walk in.</q>
               </p>
               <p>VII. <q>QUICKEN us, O Lord, we
beseech Thee, and make us more
ardous and zealous in Thy Service;
and as Thou hast sent Thy dearly
beloved Son, and our Redeemer, to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:109758:43"/>
summon us to Thy Self, so do Thou
likewise send Thy Holy Spirit to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
us for Thy Self, that we may,
by Thy heavenly Grace, become a
peculiar People, zealous of Good
Works: And we, who of our selves
are unworthy to approach Thy Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
will, by Thy Divine Assistance,
run the ways of Thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
so that at last we may attain
our End, even the Saivation of our

Gladness in the Day of the Lord

in awe of the Checks within thee: for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109758:43"/>
the Internal Testimony is of more
Efficacy than the External. Thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that Angel-Guardian, which

which will be opened at the Great Day,
as is testified by St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Rev. 20. 22.</p>

The Second is, the <hi>Book of

into Heaven's Imperial Court. The
Third is, the Book of Holy Writ; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which Golden Rule, our
Faith and Good Works shall be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured.
The Fourth, contains the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the Indigent, whom we
have defrauded or relieved. The Last
Book contains the Internal Testimony
of the Voice of Conscience; wherein
all Offences are noted: and indeed,
the Volume must be large, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
written by the Finger of Truth.</p>
               <p>III. SINNERS, in that Day, will
be fully convinced by the Terrour
within 'em; and they can no ways
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109758:44"/>
shun so just an Accusation. A Mind
undefiled, is the Crystal-Glass of the
Soul; and is so transparent, that she
evidently, by the Opticks of Faith,
beholds the Idea of the Almighty: for
a sordid Eye cannot view the Splendor
of a true Luminary. As a well Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion'd,
and good Featur'd Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
is esteem'd in the Eye of the
World; so an unspotted Conscience is
acceptable in the sight of the Almighty.
But that Conscience which abounds
with Putrefaction, generates that Worm
which continually, Vulture like, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes,
but never dies.</p>
               <p>IV. O THEN let us, while it is Day,
with a true Remorse, have a sense and
feeling of this never-dying Worm, and
diligently labour to use all Arts to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
it; and let us not indulge it by
any means, lest it abide with us to all
Eternity. VVhat can it advantage
thee, if thou wer't a Proficient in all
the Arts and Sciences in this Microcosm;
nay, though thy Skill did extend so far,
as to number the Stars, and to trace
out the ways of the Planets, and did'st
enjoy no Peace within to comfort
thee. Let it be thy care to square
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109758:44"/>
the Actions of thy Life according to
that Rule prescrib'd by the Holy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.
Let Purity reign in the Centre
of thy Heart, Verity possess thy Tongue,
and embrace Justice, that it may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
thee in all thy Proceedings. All
which will evidently demonstrate whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thy Life be Good or Evil.</p>
               <p>V. ALL the Applause and Breath
of the VVorld is insignificant, if thy
Bosom Friend, thy Conscience, accuse
thee? And what can all their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
prejudice thee, if she defend
thee? This potent <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>udge thou car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest
about thee, is sufficient to Accuse,
Testifie, and to Condemn thee: This
Justice holds the Balance even, and
will not be bribed with unjust Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards;
never will she be mollified with
fruitless Prayers, but she indefatigably
follows thee whithersoever thou goest,
and will attend thee where-ever thou
art, carrying about her that Charge
which thou hast committed to her
custody, whether it be good, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be evil.</p>
               <p>VI. AND as the Testimony of thy
Conscience evidences against thee, such
Judgment must thou expect from the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109758:45"/>
Judge of all Men. Sinners themselves,
at last, shall become their own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers,
though no other Testimony ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
against them. For Instance,
The Drunkard, when he is overwhelm'd
with VVine, or Strong-drink, hath no
sense of the Prejudice he hath receiv'd
by his Intemperance; but having slept
away his Drunkenness, the charm of
sensuality is fractur'd, and he feels the
smart of his own Imbecillity.</p>
               <p>VII. So Sin, that Diabolical Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
whil'st it is agitating, darkens
the Mind, and, like a condense Cloud,
obscures the Lustre of perspicuous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but at length the Voice within
is rouzed up like a Lion, and rendeth
more vehemently than any other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser.
Oh, let us all, betimes, mortifie
this Worm, by the fervour of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion,
that it may not gnaw upon
us, to our Destruction, and lead us to
Eternal Horrour. Extinguish this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Fire by thy Prayers and Tears,
that so thou may'st enjoy Heaven in the
Cool of the Day. VVhich God of his

which for ever secludes and interdicts
them from it. It is no surprizing won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that many imagine there is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
Place like this; for its Torments
are not to be parallell'd.</p>
               <p>II. FIERY Furnaces, Stakes, Grid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irons,
or <hi>Phalarus</hi>'s Bull, are but Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles,
to this greedy Vulture. Tortures
of the modernest Invention, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
Penalties, compar'd to this
Crulty: Those inhumane dying
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109758:46"/>
Miseries, do but inrage and stupifie
Sense; whil'st this vital Death, this
destroying Life, exercises its Malice
on a more Celestial Object; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to demolish and ruine an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Part, makes Death it self a
Principal, and gentle Murtherer to it.</p>
               <p>III. CROAKS of Ravens, Shrieks
of Owls, and Houls of Wolfs, that
adds Obscurity to the dismal Night;
Groans of departing Souls that invade
the Ear, and fill the Apartment with
trembling Epitaphs, transcribed in
Characters mournful as the Grave and
Silence; are well-tuned Harmonies,
to the dying Elegiacks of a wounded
Spirit, that vents nothing but bloody
Satyrs against it self. Behold how,
with the disconsolate Psalmist, it goes
mourning all the Day and Night, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd
with Sorrows, and surrounded
with dismal and fatal Idea's, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
his Bed into a Bath, which those
weeping Fountains of Tears, his Eyes,
have distilled! and instead of splendid
and gentle Airs, evaporates nothing
but dark and trembling Accents! which
busie Satan labours to retort in doleful
and despairing Eccho's.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:109758:46"/>
IV. HOW contritely doth it expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulate
with Heaven; My dearest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
is that amiable Attribute of
thy Mercy lost? Is the Fountain of it
dried up from a poor and wretched
Sinner? And wilt thou be a Jesus of
Mercy to the whole Universe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
none to me? Oh, let me descend
from the loftiest Precipice, and for
ever dwell in noisom Dungeons, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by none but loathsom Toads,
Snakes and Serpents, beyond the reach
and sight of all the World, so I may
but enjoy the Light of thy Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance!
Let me live more poor and
despicable than patient <hi>Iob</hi> upon his
Dunghill, perplex'd with Boils, and
and in a naked and dejected Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
so I may but conceal my
<hi>Leopard's Spots,</hi> and place a Beauty in
my Soul, which may invite that All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
Eye, whose radient Beams can
comfort all Mankind!</p>
               <p>V. TAKE heed, thou Sensualist,
that now revellest and riottest in the
World's Theatre, and counter-charms
Damnation: Wer't thou but sensible
of the terrible Agonies of Guilt, the
Horrours of a murdering Sin, and the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109758:47"/>
cursed Stings thy Pleasures leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them, how speedily would'st
thou list thy self in nobler Services,
and employ thy Time in better
Thoughts? Wer't thou now to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
thy Breath, how would the Guilt
of an evil Life appale thee, when every
Sin would represent it self a Messenger
of Horrour, and the deluding World
prove but an infernal Comforter.</p>
               <p>VI. SHEW me in a Glass that
Champion Conscience, that will not
undertake, at length, to conquer that
frozen Soul, whose Flashes will not
liquefie and blast again, that <hi>Atlas</hi>-Sinner,
whom gentle Burdens will
not, at last, numerously depress. The
VVorld is unquainted with a Misery
equivolent; the Terrours of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcom
Grave are inconsiderate to it:
which, could it but relieve the guilty
Soul, and its tenebrous and silent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
promise an Immunity from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Miseries, how readily would it
purchase its Peace with Death, and
implore its keenest Dart for a swifter
Passage? Loss of Friends, Fortune,
or Reputation, nay, Crosses which
penetrate the Bone, are but slight
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:109758:47"/>
Scratches, to these gaping VVounds.
Procure me a Schedule of the deepest
Afflictions; and there is none, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
except this, which is not tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to be dispensed with: <hi>But a
wounded Spirit, who can bear?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. <q>O LORD, how Ponderous
is the Load of a VVounded Spirit!
How Formidable are the Stings of a
Guilty Conscience! and the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of Thy Fiery VVrath! And
how Deplorable is he that involves
himself in Sin, and becomes insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of his Guilt, till the <hi>Memento</hi>
of his heinous Crimes display it:
And when Mortality remembers him
of a Future-State, nothing is his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
but his erroneous Life.
Oh, Omnipotency! Thou hast fixed
an impartial Register in our Breasts
which no fawning Practice can
bribe, nor Fountain of vulgar Tears
silence from recollecting us of Thy
Justice; and yet what numbers are
there whose Consciences, like the
great <hi>Leviathan,</hi> snap in sunder the
Silver Cords of thy Divine Law, like
Threads of Flax? and are so back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
from Confessing their Crimes,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:109758:48"/>
that they are become obdurate in
their Impenitence? But, Lord, do
Thou teach me, as I commit Sin, so
inspire me with Thy Grace daily,
that whenever I shall approach Thy
Presence, I may have no other Sins
to testifie against me, than those
which I possess; which if not
throughly crucified, yet, at least,
sincerely repented of with hearty
Contrition.</q>

                  <q> Be ye cloathed with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;

               </epigraph>
               <p>IF thou do'st but seriously consider
the miserable State of Mankind,
thou wilt easily shun the Temptations
of an arrogant Spirit. <hi>Man,</hi> the Lord
<q>of all Below,</q> though he assumes to
himself that Pride of Heart, yet he is
Vile in his Ingress, Miserable in his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109758:48"/>
Progress, and Lamentable in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress:
He is often assaulted, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
by Satan's Temptations: He is
allured by Delights and Pleasures, cast
down by Tribulations, entangl'd by
Accusations, disrobed of Vertues, and
ensnar'd into evil Habits and Customs.
<hi>Why then art thou proud, O Earth and
Ashes?</hi> Eccles. 10. 9. VVhat wast
thou in thy Conception, but sinful
Corruption? VVhat in thy Life, but
a Lump of Flesh? And what after
Death, but Food for VVorms? If
there be any spark of Goodness in thee,
it is not thy own, but the Almighty's,
who is the only Donor of it.</p>
               <p>II. THOU can'st claim nothing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to thy self, but Sin which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd
thee into the VVorld; and
therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if Divine Omnipotence hath
inspired into thee any measure of His
heavenly Grace, give Him the Glory
to whom it is most due. If thou wilt
be Christ's Disciple, observe His Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
<hi>Learn of me, for I am meek and
lowly of heart,</hi> Mat. 11. 29. And he
that observes this Lesson, will at length
attain to be a Proficient in the School
of Humility. Our Saviour, the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:109758:49"/>
of Humility, stiles Himself, <hi>the
Lilly of the Vallies,</hi> Cant. 2. 1. Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
That He is the most imbellish'd
of all Flowers; and springs forth, not
in the mountainous and lofty proud
Hearts, but in the low Vallies of the
contrite and humble Spirits.</p>
               <p>III. AND the Royal Psalmist tells
ye, <hi>God dwelleth on high, and yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth
the things that are</hi> humble, <hi>both
in heaven and earth,</hi> Psal. 113. 5. If
we contemplate with our selves, we
may soon come to this result, That
we cannot approach unto that Great
Being, unless we tread in the Paths
of Humility; for he that appears vile
in his own Eyes, is valuable in the Eyes
of the Almighty. VVeakness and
Frailty is entail'd upon Humanity,
and none can pretend to boast of such
an Imbecillity. <hi>The twenty four Elders,</hi>
(Rev. 4. 4.) <hi>cast down their Crowns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Throne,</hi> (ver. 10.) and <hi>render
unto God all praise and glory.</hi> And <hi>the
Seraphims cover their faces, before the
face of the most Highest,</hi> Isa. 6. 2. VVhat
then should Man do, who is the vilest of
all Creatures, the worst of Sinners, and
so unthankful to his Creator.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:109758:49"/>
IV. CHRIST, the Everlasting Son
of God the Father, wonderfully
descended from Heaven in great Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
and miraculously condescended
to take our frail Nature upon Him,
and stooped so low as to be crucified
for us: And what should poor Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
answer for so high an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
who is gone so far astray from
his Maker? Behold, thou aspiring
Soul, with what wonderful Humility
thy Saviour hath allayed thy Pride!
And do'st thou still swell with Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
By the Path of Humility, and
his bitter Death and Passion, <hi>Christ
entered into his Glory,</hi> Luk. 24. 26. And
dost thou imagine ever to reach Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-Gates,
by wallowing in the haughty
way of Pride: <hi>Lucifer,</hi> for his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
was expell'd Heaven; and our
First Parents, for Diabolical Pride,
was cast out of Paradise: And dost
thou think to arrive at Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
through a Sea of Pride?</p>
               <p>V. OH, let us rather demean our
selves, with an humble jesus, to wash
the Feet of others, than to seek ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously,
with Satan, for the highest
Place. Let us humble our selves under
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109758:50"/>
the Mighty Hand of God, in this Life
present, that we may be exalted, in
due time, in the Life to come. Fix
not thy Heart upon what thou hast,
but consider seriously what thou want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est.
Mourn for those Graces that are
absent, rather than extoll those Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
thou hast acquired. Conceal,
with all humility, what good Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
thou do'st enjoy; but confess
those Sins thou daily committest.</p>
               <p>VI. AS Fire is preserv'd by covering
with Ashes, so Charity is secur'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Guard of Humility. <hi>Pride</hi> is
the Seminary, Parent and Nurse to all
Sins: Exercise therefore thy Vigilance
and Care against any Elevation, lest
by the precipice of thy Folly thou be
cast headlong into the deep abyss of
Sin and Misery. And now having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd
the Detestableness of this Sin of
Pride, and the Amiableness of this
Virtue of Humility, let us earnestly
endeavour to abandon the one, and
embrace the other; and with all San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,
invoke the God of all Spirits to
infuse into us his heavenly Grace, that
this Tumour of Pride may be asswag'd
in us; that his Meekness and Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

               <head>MED. XIII. The Proud Pharisee.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Luk. xviii. 11.</bibl>
                  <q> The Pharisee stood and
prayed thus with himself, God, I thank
thee, that I am not as other men are,
extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or
even as this publican.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>SEE how Ingratitude is radicated in
this proud Pharisee, that he so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periously
thanks Heaven! How pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiously
hath Pride metamorphos'd
him! He that accustom'd himself to
prolix Prayers, intends now to use bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity:
His devoutest Posture is, Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and he comes not to Pray, but
to Boast; not to Worship his Creator,
but to Extoll himself: He is not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd
to be highly Pious, being so opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionated
and transported with his own
Virtues, that he is destitute of either
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:109758:51"/>
Time or Patience to remember the
sole Author, whose Benignity he
would pretendedly seem to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but 'tis so luke-warmly, 'twere
better he were ungrateful still.</p>
               <p>II. TRUTH had a lucky chance,
to proceed from such graceless Lips.
He did, indeed, far excell others, even
to the Superlative degree of Auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness:
But had he been acquainted
with himself better, he would have
proved more Grateful, and not so Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant.
How amply doth he disturb
the Ear of Heaven with these Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his singular Value; but for
his Pride and Arrogancy, makes not
the least Apology. Indeed, he Thanks
the Almighty; but 'tis after a modish
Carelessness, and rather an airy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement,
than a solid Prayer.</p>
               <p>III. HE may plead Ignorance; but
be found guilty of the breach of the
Second Commandment, in the First
Table. For he knows he is forbid to
Worship Idols, or Images; yet thinks
it no Sin to Idolize himself: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
dares presume to offer to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
a Schedule of his own Merits.
How many apt Scholars is there in the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109758:51"/>
World, that hath perfectly learn'd this
Lesson, and imprinted it in their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory?
See how the Roman Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees
charm and puff up themselves
with Pride, by their sanctimonious
Acts of Supererogation, and think to
scale Heaven by a Ladder of their own
forming; magnifying a superabundant
Piety, and triumphing in a merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
superfluity of performing more
than their appointed Task.</p>
               <p>IV. WITH how much Agility do our
trembling Enthusiasts follow their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
Path, in a sanctimonious Pride,
by a supercillious Purity of Intention;
presuming it their Prerogative to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Universe, and create it again
a-new? That Canonize themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their mode; and with the
proud Pharisee, not only thank the
Almighty, but tell him positively they
far excell other Men; That outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
and loudly proclaim them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the great Luminary of the World,
and in a devout lunacy, wou'd croud
in new Notions, extravagantly decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Religions but their own?
These malecontented Pretenders im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure
themselves a-part from others;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:109758:52"/>
and by a morose Piety, are become so
prodigiously Divine, that they have
always extinguish'd their Humanity.</p>
               <p>V. NOW, if the Pharisee were not
as other Men, yet these resemble him,
having been such exact Proficients in
his Nature and Religion. <q>So apt
and prone, O Lord, are we to be
seduced, even in our best Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,
and (whil'st we vainly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
our selves not only to excell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
but so meritorious in Thy sight)
as to be elevated into Presumption.
Tis Humility must Crown all our
Graces, and put a Lustre on our
Requests, whil'st the presuming As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of our own Merits does not
only deface, but seclude us from
Thee.</q>
               </p>
               <p>VI. <q>TEACH us therefore, O Lord,
with such Expressions of Gratitude,
to use Thy Gifts, that we may not
be stupified, so as to be forgetful of
our selves or Thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whil'st others
arrogantly boast themselves in meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Acts of Supererogation, let
us earnestly endeavour humbly to

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109758:52"/>

which hunger and thirst after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
are freely invited. He that
tasteth not, is not sensible of the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this Divine Banquet; and he
that has lost his Appetite, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
a Guest at this Table. If thou
believest on the Lord Jesus, obey the
first Summons, and approach with
chearfulness to this Royal Repast.
None can acquire a Credulity, unless
with Contrition he confess his Sins,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:109758:53"/>
and repent of the same in Dust and
Ashes. And as Contrition is the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Hunger of a Soul surrounded with
Sin, so Faith is the spiritual Food that
revives and nourishes it to Everlasting
Life.</p>
               <p>II. GOD gave the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the
Wilderness, <hi>Manna, the Food of Angels,</hi>
Exod. 16. 15. And in this Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the New-Testament, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
exhibits to us the Celestial
<hi>Manna;</hi> yea, he is there present him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who is that <hi>spiritual bread which
came down from heaven to give life unto
the world,</hi> Joh. 6. 51. <hi>He which had a
desire to see his Field, refused to come,</hi>
Luk. 14. 18. From whence we may
inferr, That they which set their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
on the Pleasures of this Life,
cannot approach to this Holy Table.
When the rich Gallant, in the Gospel,
heard that he must forsake all his
Goods of Fortune, for Eternal Life, <hi>he
went away sorrowful,</hi> Mat. 19. 22.</p>
               <p>III. CHRIST, the Celestial <hi>Elisha,</hi>
infuses not the Oyl of his Loving-kindness
but into <hi>Vessels</hi> which are
<hi>empty,</hi> 2 King. 4. 4. And his Divine
Love never inspires any Soul, except
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109758:53"/>
the Love of the World be extracted
from it, whereby it may become a fit
Receptacle for so Divine a Guest: For,
<hi>where our treasure is, there will our
heart be also,</hi> Mat. 6. 21. Temporal
Enjoyments hath its attrrctive Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but Divine Love hath that
Energy to unite us to the Deity. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Treasures consists in the Goods
of Fortune; but in these the Soul can
acquire no Satisfaction, for it is beyond
what this World can afford, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seeks for far greater Excellencies
than transitory things.</p>
               <p>IV. DID we but seriously consider
the Duration of all Temporalities, we
would not fix our Hearts so fervently
upon them: For upon our Bed of
Mortality no Relief can be expected
from 'em; and what an absurdity is it
for us to place our Affections on those
things which are so frail and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant!
Our First Parents, when they
rebelled against the Most High, would
have attempted the <hi>Tree of Knowledge
of Good and Evil;</hi> but before they could
accomplish their Designs, were <hi>driven
out of Paradise,</hi> Gen. 3. 6. So may we
expect, it that Immortal Part, our
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:109758:54"/>
Souls, should forsake him who hath so
dearly purchas'd 'em, and cleave unto
the World; but that we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the same, if not a worse Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>V. THEY which neglect our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
candid Invitation of, <hi>Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, all ye that labour and are heavy
laden,</hi> shall not avoid hearing of him
pronounce that Sentence of, <hi>Go ye
cursed into everlasting fire,</hi> Mat. 25. 41.
The <hi>Sodomites</hi> were <hi>consumed with fire,</hi>
Gen. 19. 24. for refusing to hear <hi>Lot</hi>'s
Doctrine. and without a speedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
the Fire of God's Anger will
consume them which have despised his
Gospel, and rejected all Reproof. The
five Foolish Virgins who neglected
trimming their Lamps, were excluded
the Bridegrooms Presence; so those
whose Hearts are not inspired with
Celestial Oyl, must expect to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd
the Participation of Eternal
Joy and Comfort.</p>
               <p>VI. CHRIST internally calls to us,
by his Holy Spirit, and secretly affords
us Motives to holy Desires, devout Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and pious Cogitations; and
happy is he whose Soul is invested with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109758:54"/>
these Ornaments. When thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivest
the least spark of the Divine
Goodness in thee, which doth excite
thee to the performance of any good
Duty, then labour to cherish it, that
it may break out into a flame; and
take heed that thou quench not the
Spirit, and by that means extinguish
the Operation: And the Apostle af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms,
<hi>If any man defile the Temple of
God, him shall God destroy,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 17.</p>
               <p>VII. THE Heart of a Man, is the
living Temple of the Lord; and he is
guilty of the Destruction of it, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth
to give place to his Holy Spirit.
The Prophets, in the Old Testament,
diligently hearkned unto the Word of
the Lord; and were prophetically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired,
as a Reward for their-Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And in the New-Testament, the
Disciples and Apostles were punctual
in preaching the Gospel, and they were
inspired by the Holy Ghost; and were
at last Crown'd by the Merits of Christ,
as a Recompence for their Labours;
and to those which shall imitate such
good Examples, blessed are they which
shall hear and persevere in such good
Performances.</p>

               <head>MED. XV. True Contentment.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Phil. iv. 12.</bibl>
                  <q> I know both how to be
abased, and I know how to abound:
every where, and in all things I am
instructed, both to be full, and to be
hungry; both to abound, and to suffer
need.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>NONE but this happy Apostle,
such a divine Saint as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
was, could become a Proficient in this
Lesson. How few is there, that have
desired to learn it? 'Tis a Lecture
the World hath long ago been weary
of: not so much, because 'tis so hard
a Task, but because 'tis so unpleasant
a Theme. Were the Way to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Happiness strewed with Roses
of Pleasure, for our sensual Appetites
to range and revel in, 'twould quickly
become a frequented and an easie
Walk. Were there no Difficulties, no
skilful Trials to be past through, who,
of a Mortal, would not become a Saint?
The Crown of Eternal Glory would be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:109758:55"/>
as common as a Garland of Flowers,
did not that of Thorns carry the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence.</p>
               <p>II. THE World values not a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which disanuls all Splendour,
whose strict Discipline abrogates all
Pomp and Pleasure; and instead of
all Temporal Delights, which affects
the Senses, preaches Temperance, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
and the Judgement to come.
This Doctrine possesses us with an
aguish Fit, and then we, like <hi>Felix,</hi>
fall a trembling, and desire to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
from so piercing a Duty. He
that invites us to see Heaven first, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, That to desire Temporal
Enjoyments, is the Wish of an Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick:
<hi>For after all these things do the
Gentiles seek,</hi> Mat. 6. 32. And shall
Christians follow the Examples of
Heathens? and aim not at sublimer
Things than what this sublunary World
can afford? Shall they who can, by
the Eye of Faith, take a prospect of
Eternity, look down upon this Lower
World with Affectation?</p>
               <p>III. AND was that the Occasion of this
Invitation we gave the Most Highest?
Did He which made the Heavens bow
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109758:56"/>
them, come down, and unthrone him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to convey us thither, and do we
lie wallowing in our Sins for ever?
How Vile, Base, Vain, and Senseless a
Creature is that Person, that winds up
his Felicity in the fruitless Enjoyments
of this Life, and eagerly resigns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to sordid Sense! But tell me,
O Thou that reignest in Plenty, and
obscurest Heaven in Oblivion, should
the two bright Luminaries be invested
in their Purple Robes, and transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Lustres, like bleeding Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors,
change their Rays into Crimson
Streams; were the Air now crouded
with Sounds of the last Trumpets,
ecchoing audibly in our Ears an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
Judgment; How prodigious
would that Mutation appear! What
vast and horrid Consternations would
the remembrance of thy Profane and
Atheistical Plenitude then strike and
amaze thee with!</p>
               <p>IV. INDEED, these Mundane En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
are so trivially poor &amp; empty,
that he which fixes his Hopes in their
Fruition, will speedily find himself but
an eternal Mendicant, a wretched, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
and deplorable <hi>Dives.</hi> And
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109758:56"/>
yet such is the apparent Sanctity of the
whole Universe, to scoff at Religious
Poverty, and deride the Exigencies of
a Devout Life, as an Adversary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
He is ignorant of the Joys of a
Future State, and of an Expected
Eternity, that thinks there's no Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
beyond this Hands Breadth, no
Happiness beyond this slender Span.</p>
               <p>V. WERE we but sensible of the
glorious Reward which shall Crown
the World, for that which she terms Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,
that Felicity that attends on the
most suffering and dejected Devotion,
we should glory in our Wants, be
affected with Hardship, and inure our
selves to Poverty with Delight; we
should be willing, not only to depart,
but to live Martyrs; rejoyce even in
the lowest State, to purchase Heaven;
and chearfully learn that Art, with the
holy Apostle, to suffer Want here, and
to labour how to abound in that Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
which is infinite.</p>
               <p>VI. <q>AND yet how hard a Task
is it for us to endure even the pettiest
Affliction, for Thy sake, O Lord?
So senseless are we of Thine abundant
Goodness, so wilfully forgetful of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109758:57"/>
Thy Omnipotency, that we not
only, in our greatest Necessities,
arraign and condemn thy vigilant
Providence, but are ready even to
turn Pagans in our unhappy Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.
Open Thou our Eyes,
O Lord, that we may behold the
Vanity of this transitory World, and
the Deceitfulness of our own Hearts;
that the alluring Pleasures of it may
neither swallow us up, nor the Los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of it overthrow our Hope, or
discourage our Obedience. Let that
illuminated Glory which Thou hast
freely promised to those that van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish
the World for Thy sake, be
ever in our sight; that in whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
State we are in, we may still
be found triumphing in Faith, and
at last receive, as a Recompence
of Reward, a Crown of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</q>

               <head>MED. XVI. Of Divine Faith.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Heb. xi. i.</bibl>
                  <q> Now faith is the substance
of things hoped for, the evidence of
things not seen.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>LET us now consider the Efficacy
of Faith, and offer up an Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Praise and Thanksgiving unto
him who is the only Giver of it. It is
that alone which ingrafts us into the
Body of Christ; and as Branches ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
their Sap from the Vine, so from
him proceeds Life, Righteousness, and
Salvation. <hi>Adam,</hi> in his pristine State,
fell, and lost his Divine Image, by his
Incredulity; but we are restor'd again
by Grace; and the Image of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
by Faith, is renewed in us.
By this Faith, Christ dwells in our
Hearts; and where He inhabits, there
His Grace resides, and an Assurance of
an Inheritance of Eternal Life.</p>
               <p>II. AND as the Effects of Faith
are Wonderful in their Operation, so
they are Exemplary in their Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:109758:58"/>
For, <hi>By Faith, Abel offered
unto God a greater sacrifice than Cain,</hi>
Heb. 11. 4. So, by Faith, we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to offer Omnipotency <hi>spiritual
Sacrifices;</hi> that is, <hi>the Fruit of our Lips,</hi>
Heb. 13. 15. And, <hi>by Faith, Enoch
was translated,</hi> Heb. 11. 5. So that
Vertue withdraws us from the Society
of the World, and invites us to <hi>place
our Conversation in Heaven,</hi> Phil. 3. 20.
<hi>By Faith, Noah prepared an Ark,</hi>
Heb. 11. 7. So we, by that Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Virtue, are received into that
Church wherein our Souls are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
amidst all the Storms and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests
which happen in the World.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>BY Faith, Abraham left an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Land, and went into a strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
in Expectation of the Promised
Land,</hi> Heb. 11. 8, 9. So by the
Energy of that Vertue, we depart
this World, forsaking all that is near
and dear to us, expecting to arrive at
that Celestial <hi>Ierusalem</hi> which God <hi>hath
prepared in the Heavens,</hi> Rev. 21. 2.
We are Strangers and Pilgrims on this
side Heaven, and travel, by Faith,
unto a heavenly Countrey. <hi>By Faith,
Moses chose rather to suffer Affliction
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:109758:58"/>
with the People of God, than to enjoy the
Pleasures of Sin for a season,</hi> Heb. 11. 25.
So Faith animates us to contemn the
World, and to despise the Glory, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
Riches and Pleasures of it; and
excites our Minds to Eternal Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>VI. <hi>BY Faith, Israel kept the Passo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
Heb. 11. 28. So we, by the Eye
of Faith, celebrate the Lord's Supper;
where Christ is the Paschal Lamb,
whose <hi>Flesh is meat indeed, and whose
Blood is drink indeed,</hi> Joh. 6. 55. <hi>By
Faith, Rahab was saved,</hi> Heb. 11. 31.
So, in the universal Conflagration of
this World, we shall be saved from
Destruction. <hi>By Faith,</hi> the Fathers
<hi>overcame Kingdoms, stopt the Mouths of
Lions, and quenched the force of fire,</hi>
Heb. 11. 33. So we, by Faith, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Kingdom of the Prince of
Darkness, escape the Treacheries and
Rage of the infernal Lion, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd
from Hell's implacable Malice,
and everlasting Burnings.</p>
               <p>V. NOW, <hi>Faith</hi> is not a naked
Opinion, and slender Profession; but
a true and lively Apprehension of
Christ propounded to us in the Gospel,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109758:59"/>
a full Assurance of his Grace residing
in us, the Tranquillity of our Souls,
which relies only upon Christ's Merits.
This Faith is fructified of the Seed of
the Sacred Word, whereby the Holy
Spirit and this Vertue is united. Now,
<hi>Faith</hi> resembles a spiritual Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for our Hearts are illustrated by
its Splendor, and the Rays of a Life of
Sanctity shines forth: Evil Actions are
the Works of Darkness; and, <hi>What
communion</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is there
between light and darkness?</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 14.
Deeds of Darkness are the Seeds of
Satan, but a lively Faith proceeds from
Christ; and, <hi>What communion is there
between Christ and Satan?</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 5.</p>
               <p>VI. LASTLY, By <hi>Faith,</hi> our Hearts
are purified; but no Internal Purity
can center where the Words and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Actions are defiled. St. <hi>Iohn</hi>
tells ye, That <hi>Faith is the victory which
overcometh the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 4. Now,
there cannot be a true Faith fixed,
where the Flesh vanquisheth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and leadeth it away Captive into
the Law of Sin. No impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that persevereth in his Sins, can
be Partaker of Life Eternal; neither
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109758:59"/>
can he, without true Repentance, claim
any Privilege or Share in the Merits of
Christ Jesus. <q>Kindle in us, O God,
the Light of True <hi>Faith,</hi> that by the
Vertue of it, and Thy alone Merits,
we may obtain Eternal Salvation,
and reign with Thee for evermore,
in Thy Kingdom of Glory, World
without end, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <head>MED. XVII. The Canaanitish Woman's Faith.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Mat. xV. 28.</bibl>
                  <q> And Iesus answered and
said unto her, O woman, great is thy
faith: be it unto thee even as thou
wilt.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>BEHOLD this Canaanitish Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
how fortunate and happy
she was, to be found worthy of so
great an Expression! Her Female
Weapon compensated for the Guilt of
its past Follies; having now, by its
seasonable Answers, merited so Divine
an Eulogy. Poor Female! how en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:109758:60"/>
was she, in whose Bosom was
concealed a Treasure, which Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
Kings and Princes, compared to
her, are Indigent: All the <hi>Holy Land,</hi>
with its precious Balm, and odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
Spices, could not furnish her
with a sufficient Antidote to revive her
Darling, and charm away the Infernal
Spirit from tormenting her. Behold
these Miracles of Faith, that at once
could save two Souls, the Mother's,
and her Daughter's!</p>
               <p>II. SO miraculous and potent is
solid Faith, that even the least grain
of it can remove lofty Mountains,
level steep Hills, and smooth the most
aspert and ambitious Soul, into a meek
and fructifying Valley. 'Twas this
that calmed the Surface of the foam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ocean, that made the boisterous
Waves an easie Path, and turn'd their
furious Rage into a pleasant Walk for
St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Feet. 'Twas the Centurion's
Faith, that gave his Servant a Respite
from the Hands of Death, which all
his Guards could never have prevented:
'Twas by Faith, that the Blind Man was
restored to his Sight; which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Skill of Art and Nature to
perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:109758:60"/>
III. ALL the Admirations of the
Gospel were always concluded with,
<hi>Thy Faith hath saved thee:</hi> And yet
that Faith which then operated so
many Miracles, is now grown the
greatest Miracle it self. Whil'st some
take the Symbol for the Thing, they
fix the Magnitude of their Faith on the
Greatness of their Works; and have
so candid an Opinion of themselves,
that they imagine it Faith enough,
only to do well: Others expect to be
Canoniz'd for their Doctrines, though
not for their irregular Lives, they scoff
at all Religious Duties, and imagine
to tread the Path to Heaven only by
their Faith.</p>
               <p>IV. OBEDIENCE, hearty Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Sin, that amiable Robe of a
perplexed Soul, and the Royal Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of our Spiritual Warfare, are but
vacant Ceremonies, and both these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
Belief are of their own forming. But
Heaven is not purchas'd only by Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation:
He that fixeth his Faith in
his empty Skull, and imagines Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
hath not its Attendant, may,
like <hi>Moses,</hi> view and discourse of the
<hi>Promised Land</hi> at a distance, but never
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109758:61"/>
approach to it. Our Obedience must
cry out louder than our Pretensions.
'Tis not our Noise and Nonsence, that
will create us Saints; 'tis not our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Shew of Profession only, but
our daily Practises too, that must
proclaim us Heralds of this Faith.</p>
               <p>V. ALTHOUGH our Merits can
never reach Heaven, yet our pious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
may, if they are sincere; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is a Mercy hangs over our
Heads, that will pardon our Deficiency.
All the Blossoms and Buds of our
Piety spring forth from this Stem;
and he that either believes or loves his
Saviour that died for him, cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
he is too much industrious to live
well. This was the Female Sex's Faith
here; and she had scarce effus'd it out
with floods of Tears, when the Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Fiend, in a Consternation, forsakes
his hold, unable to endure the Eccho
of that Sound which was repeated by
the diviner Accent of our Redeemer's
Lips; and this Faith must be a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative
against Sin; and by its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner
Charms, chase Satan to his Chains
of Darkness. 'Tis this, that prepares
Heaven for us; that makes us survive
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:109758:61"/>
our Monuments, become Immortal
in our Graves, and promises Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to our Dust and Ashes: 'Tis
this that consummates our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and will safely arrive us, where
the Blessed Jesus shall receive us into
His Glory.</p>
               <p>VI. <q>O MOST Divine Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
Thou sentest Thy Son Christ
Jesus to die for us, that by Believing
in Him, we might attain to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Life. He, under whom Thou
hast put all things in Subjection, was
pleas'd to condescend to level Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with them; and dethron'd Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to undergo a Crucifixion for our
Souls, that we might receive the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of His Death and Passion, and
be Partakers of His Glory. Oh, let
not those Miseries of our depraved
Nature, which petitioned Thy Mercy
and Compassion, make us uncapable
of it: Let not those that plead Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Thee, but by Thy Miracles,
be more ardous in acknowledging
Thine abundant Goodness, than we
who by the Manifestation of Thy
Love claim an Interest in Thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Blood.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:109758:62"/>
VII. <q>BUT grant, O Lord, that
we may live in a perpetual Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
to Thy Merits, who camest
down from the Bosom of Thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to purchase and save our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Souls: To this end; do Thou
inspire into us that Faith, without
which it is impossible we should
please Thee, and with which Thou
annexes all other Graces. Teach us
so to rely on Thy Mercies, that we
may not neglect the Means, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that a dead Faith will conduct
us to that Life which Thou hast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to none but them as work out
their Salvation with Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</q>

               <head>MED. XVII. Of Love and Charity.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>2 Pet. i. 7.</bibl>
                  <q> And to brotherly-kindness,
charity.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>TRUE and Sincere Love is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
Property of a Pious
Person. No Christian can subsist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109758:62"/>
Faith; and where that Vertue is,
Charity is not wanting. Where the
Lustre of Charity is extinguish'd, the
Heat of Faith must consequently be
quenched. Thou may'st as well rob the
bright Luminary, the Sun, of his Light,
as deprive Faith of the Gift of Charity.
<hi>Charity</hi> is the External Act of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life of a Christian. <hi>The Body
is dead without the Spirit, and Faith is
dead without Charity,</hi> Jam. 2. 26. He
is not a Member of Christ, that is not
inspired with his Spirit; and he is not
endued with his Holy Spirit, that is
destitute of the Gift of Charity.</p>
               <p>II. THIS Theological Vertue, is <hi>the
fruit of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 22. And by
the Goodness of the Fruit, the Tree is
demonstrated. <hi>Charity is the bond of
Christian perfection,</hi> (saith the Apostle,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 14.) As the Bodily Members
are united together by the Spirit, so the
true Members of the Mystical Body are
united by the Holy Spirit in the Bond
of Charity. <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Temple was all
covered <hi>with Gold, within and without,</hi>
1 King. 6. 21. So our Bodies and
Souls, which are the Almighty's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Temples, ought in like manner,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109758:63"/>
both within and without, to be beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with Love and Charity. Let this
regent Vertue exercise its Efficacy in
moving thy Heart to Compassion, and
thy Hand to Contribution: For one,
without the other, is not effectual.</p>
               <p>III. FAITH receiveth all from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the Fountain of all Goodness; and
from that Stream, Charity, as a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
conveys it to her Neighbours. By
Faith, we are made Partakers of the
Divine Nature, who is <hi>Love,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 8.
Therefore, where Charity manifesteth
not Externally, Faith Internally doth
not inhabit. No Man believes in the
Lord Jesus, which doth not express
Affections of Love to Him; and none
can fulsil that New Commandment,
except he loves his Neighbour. None
can really apprehend the Benefits of
Christ, with a Heart unfeigned, which
has not Bowels of Compassion to the
distressed.</p>
               <p>IV. CHARITY is the Seminary of
all Vertues; and nothing can be of
good growth, which proceeds not from
that Root. And this Vertue truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated,
is the Soul's Spiritual Relish;
for unto it alone are all things dulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:109758:63"/>
all Adversity, Pain, Anguish,
Trouble, nay, even Death it self: And
And the Wise Man confirms this, That
<hi>Love is as strong as Death,</hi> Cant. 8. 6.
And indeed, I think I may invert the
Wise Man's Text, and with Assurance
proclaim, That <hi>Love is stronger than
Death:</hi> For Love brought down a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
to die for us Sinners, that the
Sting of Death might be removed from
us: He, when he had <hi>overcome the
sharpness of death, did open the kingdom
of heaven to all believers.</hi> Oh, let us
then embrace this Love, and die unto
Sin daily, that we may live unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</p>
               <p>V. ALL the Works of the Most
High proceeds from this lovely Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
even Punishments, Denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Judgments: The Two
great Luminaries, and the Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Heaven, illuminate not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but us wretched Creatures.
Fire, Air, Earth, and Water, were
created for our Necessity: The Beasts,
Herbs, Plants, Trees, Birds, Fish,
and Fowls, were all for our Use. And
as God has been so gracious to give
thee Plenty of these Blessings, so do
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:109758:64"/>
thou distribute to thy Neighbours ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Necessities. And this
must be done freely, with true Amity,
Affection and Compassion, else all our
Charity is nothing worth, but will
prove like <hi>sounding Brass, or a tinkling
Symbal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. <hi>CHARITY</hi> is <hi>patient,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 4.
For no Man is easily enraged with those
whom he truly affects. <hi>Charity</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
is <hi>bountiful:</hi> And he who has
been so liberal, as to resign his Heart
to his Friend, will, without all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
not with-hold from him any
temporal Enjoyments for the Relief of
his Necessity. <hi>Charity</hi> envieth not; it
thinketh no Evil, is not puffed up,
and behaveth not it self undecently:
Next, she seeketh not those things
which are her own, neither is she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
to Anger; she imagineth no
Mischief, nor rejoyceth not in iniquity;
but she beareth all things, believeth,
hopeth, and endureth all things: she
refuseth not to do unto others, as she
desires them to perform unto her.
Tongues and Prophecies shall cease,
and Arts and Sciences be destroyed, but
<hi>Charity</hi> shall never be extinguished.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:109758:64"/>
VII. LET us then study this Lesson
of Love and Charity; and howsoever
thy Friend or Neighbour be qualified
towards thee, yet remember Christ
vouchsafed to lay down his Life for
him: Therefore, refuse not to relieve
that Soul whom Christ hath so dearly
purchas'd. Let us not, while upon
Earth, live in Discord; but observe
the Psalmist's extolling of Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
<hi>Behold how good and how pleasant a
thing it is, for brethren to dwell together
in unity,</hi> Psal. 133. 1. We are all the
Servants of One Lord, all Members of
One Body: we have all One Father
that Created us, One Saviour that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
us, and One Holy Ghost that
Inspires us. Should thy Neighbour
prove thine Enemy, yet love him;
for in so doing, thou obeyest the Will
and Pleasure of the Almighty.</p>
               <p>VIII. TAKE no cognizance of what
Trespasses Man commits agrinst thee,
but consider what thou standest guilty
of against Omnipotency: Observe not
what Injuries are offer'd to thee, by thy
Enemies; but remember the Benefits
conferr'd on thee, by thy Redeemer,
who commanded thee to love thine
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:109758:65"/>
Enemies. We are Neighbours, by the
State of our Earthly Nativity; and
Brothers, by the Hope of our Celestial
Inheritance. Let us therefore fervently
love one another: <q>And do Thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
in us, O God, the Fire of Love
and Charity, by the Inspiration of
Thy Blessed Spirit.</q>

               <head>MED. XIX. An Act of Divine Lov.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Luk. ix. 57.</bibl>
                  <q> Lord, I will follow thee
whither soever thou goest.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>HE was not ignorant, but knew it
was the happiest Resolve he ever
entertain'd: Nor can any check him
for his Confidence, when it was his
Glory to have been so presumptuous:
he might have travell'd longer, and
far remoter, and not have happen'd
with such Celestial Company. Now
the Query is, Whether his Boldness,
or his Love to Christ, prompted him
to this Heroick Action? Behold, with
how devout an Importunity he salutes
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:109758:65"/>
Him whom perhaps he had never
known, seen, or heard of before, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
by his Miracles only! And that
Purity of Life which so amaz'd the
Eyes of the Universe, could not but
attract his Eyes, and inure his Heart
too: And therefore thinking it no great
Presumption to use all Arts of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
himself, nor willing to let slip
so fair an Opportunity of being Happy;
ambitious of an Admission into his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
he breaks out into Raptures,
without any other Oratory than a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
humble Earnestness, resolutely gives
Him this Salutation, <hi>Lord, I will follow
thee whither soever thou goest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. NOR could our Saviour's Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,
obstruct or deliberate his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
or dishearten his Purpose;
being not only satisfied, but ambitious
to partake of the Afflictions of so good
a Master, in whose very Necessities he
should find a Felicity beyond all Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Enjoyments. And is not this
Person a fit Example for the whole
World to imitate? <hi>He</hi> that will not
run after Jesus affectionately, yet let
him not be so scandalous, as to permit
a <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Publican</hi> to circumvent him
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:109758:66"/>
in the Journey. Are the Felicities of
Eternal Bliss of so small a Value, that
they are not worth approaching too?
Or shall we imagine every step too
tiresom, that conveys us to Everlasting
Glory?</p>
               <p>III. Were the Path to the New <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
but spread with fragrant Roses,
or millions of odoriferous Scents and
Pleasures to prevent Carnality, the
bruitish Sensualist would divert him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
constantly, and strive to be a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursor
in those Walks. The Miser
cannot follow a Crucified Saviour, for
his extortionated Lumber; and rather
than relinquish it, will make no Essay
towards it. The riotous Epicure will
not embrace that Religion that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
him to Temperance; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though,
perhaps, sometimes, Prayer
may be agreeable to him, in case of
Necessity, yet Fasting is a Stranger to
his Constitution.</p>
               <p>IV. THE Celestial Way is too
streight for proud Ambition, whose
lofty Edifice affects not to be squeez'd
in its full carreer, but must post it
away swiftly in a Road of as vast
an extant as the Universe, or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:109758:66"/>
Pit can provide him, wherein his
Troops of sinful Splendours may, as
his Concomitants, attend him in a
rank. So difficult a Task it is to
abandon the World, even for Celestial
Mansions; and contend against the
Adulation of Sense, for an Inestimable
Bliss; as if all our Hopes, all our Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
were wound and wrap'd up in
Transactions of this Life only, and no
future Expectation for us besides the
Delectablenes on this side Mortality.</p>
               <p>V. AND yet how numerous are
they that imposterously pretend to
follow Christ! but must plead Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to his Divine Steps, that pursue
Causeys not of his proposing, but of
their own shallow seeking: that beaten
Path which so many Persons of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity
have walked before us, is too
Vulgar, too Atheistical for them to
trample in; they have, by their indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable
and diabolical Industry, found
out a nearer Way of their own; and
imagine they shall arrive at the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
Countrey sooner, by shunning of
that Way they think so difficult: So
inauspicious is that eclipsed Zeal which
hotly pursues an <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:109758:67"/>
misguides 'em; and scorns the legal
steps to the Sacred Temple, but shrinks
it self in the obtuse and obscure Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths
of Enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>VI. THE Way to the Heavenly
<hi>Canaan</hi> is not thorough dark Corners;
and how streight soever it is, its Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to all Believers is kept open: 'Tis
a serene Path, from whence may be
viewed a Prospect of Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
nor need he be timerous of losing
his Way, that doth not absurdly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it. The poor sinful Mortal here
mention'd, in an Ecstasie hastes to
Jesus; and joyning Humility to Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
will admit of no Denial; but
in a Mendicant Petionary style, and
fortify'd with Confidence, thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims
his Mind, <hi>Lord, I will follow
thee whither soever thou goest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. AND now, who would not
run with Alacrity, through Adversity,
wild Woods, Desarts, and Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses?
nay, even wade thorough Seas
of Blood, to arrive safe at the Port of
the Heavenly <hi>Cannaan?</hi> He that
strives to follow after Jesus, shall
never repent his undertaking so happy
a Journey: He shall acquire such infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:109758:67"/>
Treasures in religious Poverty,
such multiplicities of Celestial Joys
and Satisfaction in the apparent Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of a Life of Sanctity, that he will
not require any great Perswasions to
excite him to this Resolution, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to forsake all, and follow Jesus
whither soever he goeth.</p>
               <p>VIII. <q>BUT 'tis Thou alone, O
Lord, that can'st raise our Souls from
the World, and make them ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
in searching after Thee and
those Things which are Above. Thou
art ascended to Thy Throne of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
in glorious Splendour; attract
our Souls after Thee in Divine Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Amity, and Spiritual Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that we may effectually make
the Vertues and Perfections of Thy
Life, the Golden Rule of ours: And
grant that we may not be so allured
with transitory things, as to be void
of Affection for Thy Glory; but
enable us to walk with Alacrity in
that Path which Thou hast trod,
and fix'd before us; that as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinally
live by Thy Goodness, we
may live to Thy Glory; and as
we move in Thee, we may inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigably
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:109758:68"/>
be ever moving towards
Thee, till we shall enjoy the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness

Kingdom, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Rom. xii. 1.</bibl>
                  <q> I beseech you therefore,
brethren, by the mercies of God, that
ye present your bodies a living sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
holy, acceptable unto God, which
is your reasonable service.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>HE that would be entertain'd a
Disciple of Christ, must wear his
Livery of Sanctity and Chastity: For,
God is a Spirit of that infinite Purity
and Chastity, that no unclean thing
must presume to approach his Presence.
It was the Opinion and Saying of a
wise Person, That the Chastity of the
Body, and the Sanctity of the Soul,
are the two Keys of Religion and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
Now, if the Body be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
pure and immaculare from all
Sordidness, the Soul cannot be ardent
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:109758:68"/>
in Supplication: <hi>Our Bodies are the
Temples of the Holy Ghost,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 19.
And therefore we must be very vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
and sollicitous, that we defile not
this Body, which is the Habitacle of
so great a Comforter.</p>
               <p>II. OUR Members are the Members
of Christ: Let us not then make 'em
the Members of an Harlot; but let us
cleave unto the Lord with Fidelity and
Continency, that we may be one Spirit
with him, and be pure as he even is
pure. The swinish <hi>Sodomites</hi> were
smitten with Spiritual and Corporal
Blindness, and their burning Lust was
punish'd with an Element proper to
their crying Sins; and the Almighty
will inflict the same Punishment on
all obscene and incontinent Persons,
with a Fire not to be extinguished:
<hi>For the smoak of the torments ascendeth
up for ever,</hi> Rev. 14. 11. Nature hath
taught us, not to be guilty in the Eye
of the World; and shall not the
Checks of our own Consciences impede
us from committing Enormities iu the
Eye of Heaven.</p>
               <p>III. DENS, Caves, nor Corners, can
exclude ns from the Divine Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:109758:69"/>
All Hearts are open to his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisciency,
all Desires are known, and
from him no Secrets can be concealed:
His Omnipresence is of that potency,
that the Voice within us, upon the
Grand Inquest, will bear Testimony
against us; and our own Enormities
being empannell'd, will condemn us
upon the Verity of the Verdict. And
who would not relinquish this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
sensual Pleasure, to evade
everlasting Burnings? If the Smoke
of that concupiscible Fire ascends up to
the Nostrils of the Almighty, nothing
can purge the Odiousness of it, but
infernal Flames.</p>
               <p>IV. OH, let then the Remembrance
of a Crucified Saviour. crucifie in thee
all inordinate Affections; and the
Thoughts of a tormenting Hell, quench
in thee all the fiery Darts of the
Wicked: Let Fountains of Tears,
spring from a sincere Repentance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
in thee this conflagrating Car<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nality;
and let the fear and dread of
the Almighty mortifie that concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscible
Enemy, that the Allurements
of it may not delude thee. Consider
with thy self the ill Consequents which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:109758:69"/>
are its Concomitants; it is full of
Anxiety and Folly, Abomination and
Ignominy; and without Repentance,
must partake of everlasting Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>V. LOOK not on the fawning out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of this Temptation; but flie from
it, as you would from a Serpent.
Check the first Motions of it; for if
you once fall to reason aud article with
it, it will prove like the Element of
Fire, if not quench'd in due time,
grow too great to be conquer'd. Next,
flie Idleness, which is the native Soil
for these abominable Weeds to grow
in; and be always employ'd in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
lawful Vocation or Business
God hath been pleas'd to allot thee;
that when the Tempter comes, he
may find thee fortify'd against Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
'Twas Idleness allured <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
to Adultery: Had he been busied
as <hi>Ioseph</hi> was, he had withstood the
Temptation.</p>
               <p>VI. THINK often of Death's Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and that his cold Hand will
one day chill that Blood which was so
apt to be inflam'd; and then tell me,
whether Mortification is not more
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:109758:70"/>
suitable to Death-bed Thoughts, than
Sordidness and Obscenity. Be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
in Prayer, and bring the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Spirit to Christ, that he may
cast him out. And to your Prayer,
add Fasting; for this Kind goeth not
forth, but by Prayer and Fasting. And
indeed, Temperance is a great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
against this Sin of <hi>Sodom;</hi> for
many times our Tables become a Snare
to us: for in pleasing our luxurious
Palate, we make Provision for the
Flesh, to fulfil the Lusts thereof. And
by Epicuring of it so here, what can
we expect when we depart hence, but
the rich Glutton's Fate, even to want
a drop of Water to cool our Tongues.</p>
               <p>VII. REMEMBER, <hi>thou must give
an account for every idle and unprofitable
word,</hi> Mat. 12. 36. And how much
more then will thy Account extend to
obscene Speeches, and sordid Actions?
Of what Continuance thy Life hath
been, while brought to a Period, and
what multiplicity of Sins soever thou
hast committed, thy Accusers and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations
will be equivalent: Then
those secret Thoughts which thou ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
resented'st, will apparently prove
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:109758:70"/>
thee obnoxious before the great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal:
From thence thou can'st not
flie, nor deceive the Omnipotence
with vain Excuses; neither can'st thou
appeal from that Sentence which will
be pronounced against thee; for there
will be Verity in the Inquisition, and
Severity in the Execution.</p>
               <p>VIII. THEREFORE, whil'st thou
art on this side the Grave, endeavour
to adorn thy Immortal Part with the
fragrant Rose of Charity, the dulcified
Violet of Humility, and the innocent
Lilly of Chastity. When thou enter'st
the List to conquer this formidable
lustful Enemy, if the Fight seem dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
animate thy self with this Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
That the Conquest will be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious:
Thou must vanquish it as thou
would'st a sturdy Beggar, give it a
positive Answer, and it is vanish'd:
but shew it Encouragement, and it will
prove like the Snake in the Fable, when
warm by the Fire, to fall a hissing. If
thou would'st not have this Enemy to
rule over thee, entertain it not in the
least corner of thy Heart, but earnestly
beseech God to keep thee in Sanctity
of Life, and Chastity of Body.</p>

to imitate your Seraphick Example
here, that he might resemble you in

Joys, such as the Heart, in all his

the imposterous and perfidious Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this Transitory World allure
our Hearts, and divest us of the Hopes
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:109758:71"/>
of this Celestial Glory, the Fruition of
this splendid Vision?</p>
               <p>II. A Magnified Vision! in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
whereof, the Regalities of this
Lower Orb, the Trophies and dazling
Splendors of the Optick Nerves, and
the Lustre of the whole Universe, is
not worth the gazing at! A Vision,
which no mortal Eye ever was Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of; but shall not be excluded, if it
don't obscurely lose it self on Inferiour
Objects here Below. No Ear did ever
audibly hear its true Description; but
may be admitted to the divine Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and heavenly Halleluja's of it,
if it incline not to the Syrenical Charms
of Sin, and the bewitching Musick of
sordid Carnality.</p>
               <p>III. 'Tis a Vision, whose bright Idea
cannot be delineated by the most ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
and contemplative Speculations
of any Metaphysical Brain, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so Angelical: 'Tis not a sublime
Fancy, but true Sanctity, that can
reach it. The Divine Apostolical Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher,
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> though lately there,
could not exactly give us a Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it; and Sacred Scripture di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinly
characters it out, but in Parables
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:109758:72"/>
and Simitudes, to demonstrate how
infinitely transcendent is that Glory
which is so unexpressible, and beyond
all comprehension. Were all the Pearls,
Rubies, Saphires and Diamonds the
Earth produces, muster'd to a Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
they would not equallize the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minitivest
Glance of the radient Beams
of <hi>Sol</hi>'s bright Eye; and yet that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Luminary, surrounded with
so many attending Constellations that
derive their Lustre from him, is but a
Spark to his shining Countenance.</p>
               <p>VI. WHO then would offer up
that Part an Oblation to the World,
which might be render'd the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of so much Felicity? and suffer
the Profuseness of his wanton Blood
to revel there, where sublimer Passions
and Flames should triumph? He that
would be an Inhabitant among the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the Just, must discipline his own
to the same Uniformity, and convert
his Body to a Temple, where his Heart
must be both Altar and Sacrifice; or
rather, an Emblem of the <hi>Sanctum
Sanctorum,</hi> for those excellent Graces
of the Spirit to inhabit in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:109758:72"/>
V. THE stately Mansion-House of
Life must be converted into a Mansion
of Divine Love; and the magnificent
Palace of Heroick Spirits, into a Royal
Court of peculiar Graces; and then
that Part which (as Natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors
observe) which lives first, and
dies last, shall become purely Vital,
and not be liable to Mortality. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a thrice Glorious Trinity
can satiate this Triangle, which must
be shaped to the purest Figure, and
taught in all its Pulses to palpitate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Heaven and Eternity.</p>
               <p>VI. OUR Bosoms must be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Closets of Devotion; and our
Hearts to Cabinets of immaculate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
and fervent Prayer; embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
with that sparkling Diamond,
a lively Faith, the Lamp at which all
our minor Graces, as Tapers, light
themselves, and like Stars, borrow
their Lustre from this Luminary. 'Tis
not a Heart that can chime to the airy
Sound of any tinkling Religion, and
pretends a Sanctity fix'd in its Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
that makes Affectation his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
and Moroseness of Humour,
Tenderness of Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:109758:73"/>
VII. NO, 'tis a Heart adorn'd with
the White Robe of Humility, crown'd
with the Diadem of Love, fumigated
by Prayers, the odoriferous Scent of
Chastity, and the Fragrancies of a
Life of Sanctity, that couches it self
within the embracing Arms of our
Saviour's Spouse, and stiles himself a
Mourner in her Persecutions; that looks
upon the VVorld as the Enemy of its
Glory, and had rather embrace Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
than prove a Rebel against Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
'Tis such a Celestial Heart that
must be a Preparative for this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendant
Vision, and happy is he that
arrives to that Purity.</p>
               <p>VIII. <q>Fortifie us therefore, O
Lord, against the Pomps and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of this wicked VVorld, and
elevate our Thoughts to the sublime
Contemplations of Thy Glory. Level
in us every arrogant Thought that
dares exalt it self against the Potency
and Purity of Thy Law; and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
us for Thy Self and Service,
that the Practick Part of a Life of
Sanctity may be our chiefest Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
that when we are sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to depart hence, we may be
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:109758:73"/>
accepted of Thee; and being fled
from the Eye of this Lower Orb,

Eye hath seen, Ear heard, nor Heart
can conceive, the Glory Thou wilt
impart in the Fruition of Thy Self.</q>

               <head>MED. XXII. Against Covetousness.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Heb. xiii. 7.</bibl>
                  <q> Let your conversation be
be without covetousness.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>COVETOUSNESS is the Root
of all Malignity; and he that is a
Slave to Riches, his Mind is always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent;
he is tugging continually at
the Oar, and accumulates worldly
Dross; but (as the Psalmist says) <hi>he
knoweth not who shall gather it,</hi> Psal. 39. 6.
And as he is impoverished in his Mind,
so he is miserable in his Station; for
Bounty and Goodness are Strangers to
himself and others; and Charity with
him is so frozen, that the Poor, instead
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:109758:74"/>
of recompenceing him with their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
are more ready to attend him with
their Imprecations. Fix not thy Trust
in uncertain Riches, but place thy
Mind on what is certain. 'Tis certain,
the Hour of Death will come, and
then what will all thy Wealth avail
thee? They cannot assist thee in a
true Repentance, nor plead thy Cause
in the Court of Heaven: They cannot
procure thee an easie Passage hence,
nor give thee Assurance of Eternal
Happiness.</p>
               <p>II. THEREFORE, lay aside this
bitter Root, and graft new Plants of
Liberality and Charity. Make haste,
with speed, and undertake this Task,
lest thou offend the Almighty, and
endanger thy own Soul. The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Person must needs allow this
Maxim, That he lives without God in
the World. And our Saviour informs
us, <hi>we cannot serve God and Mammon,</hi>
Luk. 16. 13. For he that wholly sets
his Heart upon transitory Treasure,
must of necessity unfix it from God,
and Eternal Glory; and is uncapable
of performing that Duty which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by the Almighty.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:109758:74"/>
III. SEE with what eagerness the
Covetous pursues Riches; and is
greedy as a Lion after his Prey. All
Opportunities of Gain are readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced:
Prayer, and all Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
are laid aside, to accomplish and
attend it. So prone is frail Mortality
to this Sin, that he leaves nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attempted
to answer his sordid Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice:
nay, it is often apparent, that
Unlawfulness and Fraudulency is used
by the Covetous to that degree, that
many Families have suffered Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
though it were to the utter
Ruine of the Souls and Bodies of the
Misers themselves. And now, what
can these Men expect for the Cruelties
they transact, but to be excluded from
Happiness, and to receive that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
of <hi>not inheriting the Kingdom of
God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 10.</p>
               <p>IV. THEY which hoard up Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial
Treasures, resemble those that
place their Fruits in low and moist
places, not considering they are inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to Putrefaction. Oh, how infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
are they then, which indulge
themselves to that which is liable to
Corruption? For, how can that which
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:109758:75"/>
is Temporal, satisfie the Soul which is
Eternal? The Animate Part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
all Corporal Things, by virtue
of its Spiritual Nature, that it cannot
be distended and filled by any Quantity.
All things, the higher they soar towards
Heaven, the less they cark and care to
hoard up: This may be attested by
<hi>the Fowls of the Air, which neither sow
nor reap,</hi> Mat. 6. 26. So it is with that
Immortal Part, the Soul, the more it
is elevated to its Creator, the more it
withdrawn from Temporal Riches.</p>
               <p>V. LET Contentment be the Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritious
Man's Catholicon to purge out
Covetousness. This will make him a
Proficient in the Almighty's Court,
and wholly to depend upon His Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Then he may contemplate,
That <hi>God cloatheth the lillies of the field:</hi>
And if so, much more will He cloath
them which depend upon Him. Think
on the Providence of thy Creator; and
if thou reliest upon Him, thou may'st
assure thy self, that <hi>none ever trusted
in him, and was confounded.</hi> He is too
guilty of Avarice, that chargeth the
Almighty with not granting him his
Heart's Desire; and he is too ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109758:75"/>
that expresses not his Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for those Mercies he daily, nay,
hourly receives from him.</p>
               <p>VI. CONSIDER this, now ye that
take too much Pains for Riches, what
an imprudent Choice ye use to apply
your Diligence: Ye that add House to
House, and Field to Field, a lesser
Compass at last must entomb ye;
why then do you perplex your selves
so much, and appear such busie Grasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the World; early you rise to
gripe the World, and late go to rest,
but can find no ease; your Mind is so
fix'd on uncertain Riches, that you are
perpetually loaded with Care and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
And why all this, poor Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Wretches! but to undoe others,
and lose your Souls? Did you but
wisely love your selves, you would
pursue alone your own true Happiness:
you would not become such wilful
Fools; and preferr a short vexatious
Vanity bfore an Eternal Joy and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</p>

               <p>THIS Text works no Effects
upon the Covetous; for they
had rather lose their Souls, than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
their Riches. He, for whom the
whole Creation was made, makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wretched and miserable, in chasing
after Vanity: disrobing Himself of all

Transformation, inhumes the Divinity

II. GIVE Ear, thou aspiring Meteor,
whose haughty Ambition, with <hi>Icarus,</hi>
soars to that heighth, that thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
the Wings of thy immoderate
Desires! Thou that wilt with eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
adore Satan, for a Kingdom; and

worth Ten thousand Worlds, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal

Flames!</p>
               <p>III. BE attentive, O thou indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable
Wanton, whose Soul is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable
as brutish Animals; that pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates
after Pleasure, beyond the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melion's

swimmest in iniquity, and plungest
Morality in Seas of Vice; bathing thy
self in those amorous Streams that

Play, or a melancholy Romance! and
scoffest at Heaven, and its Creator, as
if Infinite Eternity were but an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Fancy!</p>
               <p>IV. STOP not thy Ears, O thou
wretched Miser, whom the deluding
Rhetorick of Bags cram'd with Silver
Coin can invite to Hell! and art ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deously
allured to throw thy self into
the Arms of Satan, at the Musick of
tempting Gold! That can'st assist thy
weak Eyes with Spectacles; and gaze
thy self almost blind, at the Splendor
and Curiosity of a rich Gemm; and
imprecateth Geography, for defining
Riches beyond thy Sphere; earnestly
wishing thy self an <hi>Indian,</hi> that thou
might'st lead the remnant of thy Life
among the choicest Treasures; and
converse with the richest Mines, till
the Hair on thy Head were all Silver;
till thou thy self wer't all transmuted
to Ore, and every Bone turn'd into a
Wedge of the purest Gold.</p>
               <p>V. LISTEN, ye tender Gallants,
that are so attracted with the Mode of
this World, that ye have have lost all
Conceptions of a better! Ye that dwell
upon Earth, only to delight your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:109758:77"/>
Appetites; and supply your Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury

It was the elegantest Speech
the ancient Orator ever deliver'd, when
he utter'd, <hi>He would not buy Repentance
so dear.</hi> 'Twas but an Extemporay
Oration; and yet all Silver-tongu'd
Rhetorick could never parallel it: That
one Note exceeded all his Eloquence,
and will survive the Dexterity of his
Pen.</p>
               <p>VI. COULD we out-live the Lives
of Patriarchs, even beyond the Age of
old <hi>Methusalah,</hi> or of Time it self;
and with the Pleasures of the greatest
Epicures: Could we, like <hi>Cleopatra</hi>
the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Queen, dissolve a Pearl
into a Golden Cup, and drink the
Riches and Pleasure of a Kingdom at
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:109758:78"/>
a Draught; or Command all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the Universe, as positively as
ever the Centurion did his Servants:
Had we all the delectable Enjoyments
we can either wish, fancy, or chase
after, and whatever can satisfie the
Ambition of the most profuse and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Appetite: Were the whole Universe
turn'd into a Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> or a
perpetual Spring adorn the Surface of
our Mother Earth:</p>
               <p>VII. COULD we, like the <hi>Eagle,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
our Age, and not grow Old, but
still continue in our pristine Health;
or if in Years, be insensible of the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that attend the Aged: Could we
unravel, untwist, or unwind Time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
reverse and retrograde its Wheels
again; stop the swift Celestial <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
the nimble Posts of Heaven, in
their full career; and set the great
Clock of the World backward to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute:
Nay, were our Bodies of that
durability as our Souls, that we could
survive Time it self, and be a Spectator
when the World receives its Period:
Yet what shall we extract, if after all
our vain and imaginary Felicities, and
flippery Contentments, we become an
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:109758:78"/>
Oblation for Hell, enroll'd in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable
Catalogue of the Infernal Crew,
a Victim for sulphurous Eternal
Flames, banish'd to Perpetuity from
God and Heaven: Then inform me,
whoever thou art, and ask <hi>Dives</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
that necessary Question, <hi>What is?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>VIII. <q>O Lord, what is there in
this World, that should attract our
Hearts, to tire our selves in fruitless
Desires, and indulge our selves to the
Pleasures of this Life, as our chiefest
Felicity? How difficult is it for him
that is unacquainted with thy Law,
to perceive the Evacuity of those En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
he hath so long rouled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in, to resist the enticing Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
of Sin; and disesteem the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Flashes of this Life, for that
Lustre of Glory Thou wilt impart.
My God, instruct me so to use the
World, that I forget not Thee. Let
the Blessings Thou showerest down,
quicken and encrease, not stupifie my
Devotion. Elevate my Obedience,
not overwhelm my Thankfulness;
that so the Follies of the World may
become my Derision; and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Heaven, my only Ambition;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:109758:79"/>
that I may never, for a fading Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in this World, hazard both my
Soul, and thy Saving-Grace together.</q>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THIS Prayer was effectual; and
all Petitions are answer'd by the
Almighty, if deliver'd with a sincere
Faith, and a good Assurance. Let us
now be upon the Grand Inquest; Is
not Sin a Leprosie? Then every Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ought to make the same Depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He that had been a Spectator of
the Leper's Body, would not have been
amaz'd at his Prayer: and yet, could
he but have inspected his Soul, might,
perhaps, have beheld Objects more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
and horrible; the Corruption
of his Blood, which had lost its Vigour,
and proved but an useless help to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
every part without Vitality, by
so nauseating a Nutrition, instructed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:109758:79"/>
his Tongue this necessary, though dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
kind of Confident Prayer; <hi>Lord, if
thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. CHRIST, whose Bounty and
Compassion never fails to demonstrate
that the Fountain of his Love was as
large as his Power was potent, would
not reject such a Suit wherein his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Mercy was so much concern'd: and
those Members which might have been
sooner immers'd, than bath'd into a
Cure, re-assume new Vitality and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
by the liberal Bounty of a
Touch. Thus the Leper receives a
new Body; but we read no Lecture
of any Operation upon his Immortal
Part, which, perhaps, effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
it: But his Successor, who was
Bed-rid, was in a far greater state of
Happiness; for his Sin and Disease
were both healed together.</p>
               <p>III. HOW many be found, that,
like the Leper, view no higher than
their Corporeal Substance, whole Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
Part is all their Principles of
Religion; whil'st the Immortal Part,
that Spring of Life, lies all neglected
under Epidemical Infection: Our Blood
shall enjoy all the Delights that Art
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:109758:80"/>
can reach, or the most Chymical Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury
can extract, to supply its Flames;
whil'st our splendid Part, the Divine
and Celestial Fire which inspires us, lies
all extinguish'd, and bereft of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Aliment, and can reserve no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a dull and hectick Lustre to
its Maker.</p>
               <p>IV. THE Anguish of a Limb, can
attract us to more Devotion in one
Hour, than all the Concernments of
our Souls can produce in a Year: and
the deformity of the meanest Part, will
appear an Object of more Disgrace and
Dolour to us, than those pallid and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
Forms that attend Sin, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure
Heaven in us. Of all Pestilences,
this is the grandest, and yet least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded:
as if Hell were but a Trifle;
Everlasting Damnation, a Pleasure;
and the Eternal Misery of our Souls,
a Diversion. Shew me that exquisite
Beauty that is not Leprous; that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
which is so perspicuous, that
it is Immaculate; that Pattern of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity,
which may become a Saint; that
Infant, Man or Woman, which is a
Stranger unto Sin; and then I shall be
hold an Amazing Wonder.</p>

V. DID our curious Veins excell the
fragrant Violet, whose Odour perfumes
the Chymistry of the Air, the Dew of
the blushing Morn: Were our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestor,
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, an Alien to our
crimson Blood; and the Day of our
Nativity, as perspicuuous as the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didst
Morn, immaculate as the new-blown
Rose: yet the Pollution of our
irregular Lives would soon discipline us
in this Prayer; and the blackness of our
occultest Thoughts would silently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
our own Deformity; and be
ready to join with the Leper in this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
<hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst
make me clean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. AND yet, was there not to be
found, in those Days, a Generation of
Vipers, that were righteous and clean
in their own Eyes, that justify'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their own Impurity, and
reckon'd all the World but Lepers to
them? Was not the lofty <hi>Pharisee</hi> a
greater Leper than the poor <hi>Publicane,</hi>
though so ambitiously he display'd his
proud Plumes? His soaring Pride car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rry'd
more contagious Infection along
with it, than the other Persons Sins
could e'er pretend too. He that trusts
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:109758:81"/>

may infallibly lose Heaven, and those
Eternal Joys which an humble Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
doth procure.</p>
               <p>VII. <q>O LORD, though I am not
so vile as some; yet I am so vile in

a Pattern of Perfection, to my imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Soul; <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Corps a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume,
to my ulcerated Heart: yet
were I far more impotent and fractu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
than the poor Cripple of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesda;</hi>
more spotted with Leprosie
than the Nine Unthankful Lepers
which were cleansed, whose Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
was more odious than their
Disease; were those Legions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal
Spirits, ejected by Thy Sacred
Word, infused in me; and were
I as execrable as Satan could wish to
make me; yet I know Thy Paternal
Goodness, and I do not despond of
Thy Almighty Power: for, <hi>Lord, if

               </epigraph>
               <p>SINCE Sin must be destroyed, who
then would make choice of that for
his Felicity, which shall perish with
himself; whose End is not only
Death, but Hell; and will be his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
not only now, but hereafter?
Indeed, were there no hopes that our
Reliques should resuscitate again, or
the Ruines of our Frame resurrect to
a politer Shape, we might well plunge
our selves in Enjoyments here, and fix
our Felicity in delectable Pleasures:
Every Person might then be tollerated,
without Sin, to become an Epicure; and
he that could project new Modes of
Luxry, would not only pass for being
Ingenious, but be esteem'd Fortunate.</p>
               <p>II. GOOD Morality would appear
all Vice; and yet Vice it self would be
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:109758:82"/>
held no more a Crime, but our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness:
not to be Lavish, then, were a
Sin against Nature; and he that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Brutality, would be render'd most
Rational: Legal Proceedings would
then be a grand Enemy to Humanity;
there could be no Sociableness, but in
Confusion: and were there no Heaven,
nor Hell, we should pleasantly mingle
to a Chaos, and obey no other discipline
but Riot: every Person might then be
Atheistical, without Scandal: To be
without the Almighty, and his Grace
in the World, would be render'd no
Misfortune; for then every Man might
depend upon his own Merits, without
Blasphemy.</p>
               <p>III. Could they which inhabit the
Earth, die like Bruits and Animals,
and revive no more; the Hopes of not
being Damn'd, would be a greater
Comfort than the Delights of Sin. But
alas, he that enters the Grave now,
must live<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> again, that his Life may be
remember'd. Nor yet is it so much
the Terror of Death, as the Horrors of
a Guilty Conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the formidable
Prognosticks of a Future Etetnity, that
affrights the departing Soul: The
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:109758:82"/>
Pangs and Anguish of expiring Nature
are insignificant to those Stings that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Memory of our Crimes: The
deep Sorrows of the Grave, and our
being Extinct here for ever, are Joys,
to the Miseries which remain behind,
but will certainly come.</p>
               <p>IV. INFORM me now, thou that
art so indulgent to the World, and
hunts for Paradise in a Park of Sins;
thou that makest Terrestrial things thy
Treasure, and foldest up the Riches of
thy Hopes in the Bosom of Old Time,
or the Compass of a Span; when those
lucid and swift Guides of Life, thine
Eyes, shall wax dim with Age, or
tired with Pain; when every Member
shall become Sorrow's Object, and
those Parts which were so employ'd in
the Operation of Sin, shall become In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments

V. CAN those transitory Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that allured away thy Immortal
Part, restore it in convenient time?
Can those Pleasures which bereft thee
of Heaven, recover it again before
Death puts a period to thy Life? Can
thy Pomps and Vanities asswage or
allay thy deep Sorrows? or the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi>
of thy Sins, the Destruction of
thy End? Where's that soft Musick,
whose select Airs, like <hi>David's</hi> Harp,
might charm the Cries of a Guilty
Conscience; and by its skilful Strains,
drop a pleasant Harmony that might
pacifie the Trouble of thy anguish'd
Soul?</p>
               <p>IV. WHERE are those expanded
Trophies of empty Glories, thy Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
has purchas'd at the easie Rate of
only sinning for greedy Honour, for
which thou hast traffiqu'd and sold
Heaven? That Sovereignty for which
thou enslavest thy self, and lost the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Freedom of thy Immortal Soul?
Cannot all thy Grandeur excite thee
up a little; and by a fumy Power, once
so formidable and applauded, reprieve
thee from the unsatisfy'd Grave, or a
more Eternal Prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:109758:83"/>
VII. Where are those Goods of
Fortune thou hast forfeited thine Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
for, whose transporting Lustre
deprived thee of thy Eye-sight, and
render'd thee dimmer than themselves?
Can they, by their utmost Skill, neither
bribe nor purchase thy Pardon? Or will
the silent Grave require no other Fee
than so rich a Miser? Where are all
those fine Diversions that divested thee
of thy Piety, and the Thoughts of thy
Creator? those pleasing deluding Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
that swept away all sense of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and fore-sight of thy Future State?
Are all shrunk into a Tomb, and an
unwelcom Period? Are all thy Jocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities
terminated in the Confines of a
Sepulchral-Urn; and no other Objects
left for thy Concomitants, but thy
Crimes, and those Terrours thy Guilt
presents?</p>
               <p>VIII. BEHOLD now, and stand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd,
ye Adorers of the World more
than of the Almighty! and view the
Portraiture of your End, those Ruines
you have so smoothly built on! Try
if your imaginary Felicities are Proof
against this Arrow; or can protect
you from this Invader, the only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:109758:84"/>
of the World, whose general
Prison is but a Reserve for a worse, and
its Execution here, but a Reprieve for a
more durable and yet vital Mortality.
He that reign'd in Pleasures, must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
in Flames; and having long revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it
in Sin, must expect to riot it in
Torments; and the misery is, that
wishing not to live, he can never die.</p>
               <p>IX. AND yet, how foolish and vain
are our Desires still after the World?
How easie and alluringly, O Lord, are
we led by the counterfeit and transitory
Pleasures of this Life, from Thee? We
cannot plead Ignorance, but fully attest,
That <hi>the Wages of Sin is Death;</hi> and yet
how absurdly do we preferr its Service
before Thine, whose Recompence of
Reward is Life and Immortality? But
The Period of Profaneness is Eternal
Destruction, and the Delights of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
end in Confusion; and yet we ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
embrace the fawning Proffers of
Sin, before the never-failing Promises
of Everlasting Glory.</p>
               <p>X. <q>Have Pity, O Holy Jesu, upon
the weak Frailties of our Humane
and Corrupt Natures: And we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
implore Thee to pardon and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:109758:84"/>
forgive the profuse Irregularities of
our whole Lives. Grant unto us,
O Lord, a perpetual Supply of noble
and ardent Defires to run after Thee,
that the Pomps, Vanities, and Tinsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of the World, may become Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of our Scorn and Derision; and
that the bright Splendour of Thy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Glory, may create our Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to serve Thee all the Days we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
here; that we may not, for a
present temporal Enjoyment in this
transitory Life, lose the blessed Hopes,
and future Inheritance of the Saints
in Light, but at last, having finished
our Course here, we may arrive with
Joy and Gladness at Thy Heavenly
Kingdom.</q>

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>2 Cor. v. 10.</bibl>
                  <q> For we must all appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the judgment-seat of Christ, that
every one may receive the things done
in his body, according to that he hath
done, whether it be good or bad.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>IT is an Axiom, confirm'd by woful
Experience, That the generality of
them which bear the Name of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
and pretend to fight under
Christ's Banner against the Enemies of
the Apostolick Faith, are, by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate
Impieties, the greatest Scandal to
that glorious Profession: They live in
such a Universe of Wickedness, as if the
Redeemer of the World descended from
Glory, not to subvert, but to establish
the Empire of Sin; as if the main De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of their State, in this World, were
only to fulfil that voluptuous Maxim
of the Licentious Epicure, <hi>Let us eat
and drink, for to morrow we mst die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. BUT if these Proficients in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism
had a serious <hi>Memento,</hi> That
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:109758:85"/>
there is a Deity inthron'd in Heaven,
<hi>who is of purer eyes than to behold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi>
and so jealous of his Honour,
that he will not remit the least Guilt
with Impunity: could they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to devote a few Minutes of the
Time which they consume away to
finish their Debaucheries, to a solemn
Reflexion upon that inevitable Account
which will be exacted from them at the
General Resuscitation; when not only
their Words and Actions, but the most
occultest of their Cogitations shall be
brought to Judgment; it were impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for them, unless given over to a
reprobate Sense, to perpetuate under
the Dominion of their Carnal Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
and Infections.</p>
               <p>III. THE very Apprehension of the
Vengeance to come, would fright 'em
into an immediate Repentance; and
produce such an admirable Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that living <hi>soberly, righteously, and
godly in this present world,</hi> they might
be found Unblameable in the Great
Day of the Lord Jesus. And what a
Day will that be! at whose Appearance
<hi>the Sun shall be turned into Darkness,
and the Moon into Blood,</hi> Act. 2. 20.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:109758:86"/>
When <hi>the Heavens shall be rolled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

melt with fervent hert,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 10.
and this magnificent imbellish'd Struc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Material Creation must
perish in a Conflagration.</p>
               <p>IV. When the ecchoing Sound of
the Last Trumpet will be loud enough
to astonish drowsie Mankind out of the
sleep of Mortality; and all those innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
Bodies, which for so many
past Ages have inhabited the vast Re-Regions
of Forgetfulness, shall arise
from their Beds of Dust, and appear
before the Aweful Tribunal of the
Great and Impartial Judge! The
Books will then be open'd, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments
read, and every Man's
Works shall be produc'd at the Barr,
and Evidence given, either <hi>for</hi> or <hi>against
him.</hi> No Title of Honour, or Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Place; no Preheminence of
Nativity, or Excellency of Natural
or Acquired Endowments, will, in this
Court of Equity, be admitted, as a
sufficient Demurr, to an immediate
and impartial Tryal: but the High
and the Low, the Rich and the Poor,
the Noble and the Mean, the Learned
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:109758:86"/>
and the Ignorant; he that sits on the
Throne, and he that stands behind the
Mill; even from the Swayer of the
Scepter, to the Drawer of Water, must
be equally impleaded; and without
respect of Persons, receive a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
proportionable to their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>V. IN this Great Day, the Lord of
the Harvest will gather his Wheat into
Heaven's Granary, bat the Chaff shall
be thrown into Fire Unquencheable;
He shall separate his Fine Gold from
the Dross, and distinguish Right Jewels
from False and Counterfeit Sparkles:
The <hi>Sheep will then be separated from
the Goats,</hi> and True Believers mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
known from Formal Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites.
But what Tongue! not that
of Angels, can express the Joy of
those vigilant Servants, whom their
Lord, at that time, will find diligently
employ'd in the Performance of their
Duties! All that formidable Pomp,
and dreadful Solemnity, which shall
precede and attend the Advent of the
Judge, will but contribute to their
Comfort, and enhance their Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
For they shall know, that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:109758:87"/>
He, who appears with such ineffable
Majesty, to keep his General Sessions
of Righteousness, is the same <hi>Iesus</hi>
which was crucify'd for their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>VI. THEN that Exalted Saviour
will accost <hi>his Followers in the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi>
Mat. 19. 28. with these or
the like transporting Expressions:
<q>
                     <hi>you</hi> my beloved Disciples, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
all that the World call'd
Grandeur and Generosity, for the
sake of your Crucify'd Lord and
Master, and despis'd the present En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
of Flesh and Blood, in
Expectation of a Future and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
State of Felicity. <hi>You,</hi> who
who retain'd your Obedience, in
the mid'st of a Rebellious Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and embrac'd Vertue, in an
Age of Impiety and Prophaneness.
<hi>You,</hi> who subdu'd your sensual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
by the Austerities of Self-denial,
and conform'd them to the
sublimer Dictates of Reason and
Religion. And <hi>You,</hi> who rejoyc'd
in the Day of Tribulation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
the Doctrine of the Gospel
by an exemplary Patience in the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:109758:87"/>
Day of Adversity: This is the Day
wherein you shall receive a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
for all your Sufferings; a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
so incomparably Glorious,
and of such Sublimity, that it will
at once create and accomplish your
Beatitude.</q>
               </p>
               <p>VII. <q>Your Troubles were Finite,
and expired in a Moment; but the
Duration of your Bliss will be Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and Eternal: You shall now
enter into that Heavenly Kingdom,
where all your Tears shall be wiped
from your Eyes; and those Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal
Drops which you plentiful shed
in the Prosecution of your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
shall be congeal'd into Pearls,
to enrich your Diadems, and imbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
your Robes of Immortality:
There no Deluge of Sorrow shall
disturb the Serenity of your Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
no Anxiety or Perplexity, no
Discontent or Vexation shall intrude
within the Limits of your Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but you shall securely bathe
in Oceans of unmix'd Pleasures,
and feast upon Delights which know
no period.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:109758:88"/>
VIII. BUT, while these Fluctuations
of the Divine Mercy will consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
a Beatifick Calm in the Breasts
of the Righteous, what irresistable
Tempests of Consternation shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciate
those impenitent Wretches,
who chose their Portion on this side
Heaven; and preferr'd the Dung and
Miseries of a transitory World, before
the Real Joys of a Solid Eternity?
Now, they shall in vain invoke the
Mountains to bury them beneath their
perpetual Ruines; that by a more
tolerable Destruction, they might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the Fury of that Almighty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
ready to overwhelm them.
But what will attribute them, in these
inextricable Exigencies, that they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
the Quintessence of the Earth;
that they were splendid in Wealth and
Honour; that they inhabited Palaces
of Cedar, and took their Repose under
Canopies embroider'd with Gold; that
they were homag'd by Crouds of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasites,
and grew Famous in Popular
Applause; that they were the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
of Crowned Heads, and the
Darling of the Multitude; that all
things past currrant according to their
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:109758:88"/>
Desires, and were not molested by the
Misfortunes of other Men: when those
illustrated Accommodations did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
but to render 'em the more
magnificently Miserable; when they
vanish'd like a visionary Dream of the
Night; but the <hi>Memento</hi> and Guilt
of their Absurdity, will, like venomous
Snakes and Serpents, cling to their
Consciences, and become their remorse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Executioners for infinite Ages.</p>
               <p>IX. THEN the Eyes of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
will be opened, which the
Fascinations of Sin had kept long
clos'd; and they shall perceive the
Folly and Frailty of those impertinent
Trifles which they courted with so
much Passion and Eagerness; and for
whose unsatiable Fruition they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
their Immortal Souls, forfeited
their Title to a blissful Immortality,
and subjugated themselves to those
tremendous Extremities which are the
inseparable Concomitants of an inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Damnation. What heaps of
Treasure then would they give, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enjoy
one Minute of that inestimable
Time which they profusely expended
in the unprofitable Works of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:109758:89"/>
that for so inconsiderable a space,
they might be but within a Possibility
of Salvation? What Presidents of
Mortification! What Miracles of Piety?
What inimitable Examples of Vertue
and Goodness would they appear to
Mankind, were they to renovate the
Lease of their Lives! How would they
disesteem all those magnificent Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
and glittering Annihilations,
which the idolizing Worldling so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterously
admires; and esteem the
unmatchable Treasure of a Pacifick
Conscience, unspeakably beyond the
most transcendent Terrestrial Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments!</p>
               <p>X. BUT alas! 'twill be then too
late for Repentance; and they who,
in the Day of their Visitation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd
the repeated Proposals of a
Redeemers Reconciliation, shall, at
this Juncture, with Tears of Blood,
supplicate for Mercy, and be refus'd
it: and the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> who would
have been their Saviour, and so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
extended his compassionate
Arms to receive them into Favour,
if they would but Believe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
will, as their inexorable Judge,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109758:89"/>
utter this direful Sentence against them,
<hi>Depart from me, ye cursed, into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
fire, prepared for the Devil and
his Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XI. O IRREVERSIBLE Decree!
from whence there can be no Appeal!
and which no sooner pronoun'd, but
those Condem'd Wretches must be for
ever exil'd from the Ecstatical Presence
of the Almighty; and by Legions of
apostate Spirits, haled away to the
dismal Place of Horrour and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
where they shall languish under
the pressure of intollerable Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and, by Wonder of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
shall in Torrents of Fire, endure
Extremity of Frigidity; and in Rivers
of Ice, be tormented with perpetual
Burnings: There they shall feed the
<hi>Worm that never dies,</hi> and transude in
those Flames which cannot be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd.
And the Consideration of the
Perpetuity of those Supernal Felicities
which they rejected for Vanities, and
of the infinite Continuation of their
infernal Tortures, will shipwreck all
their Hopes in the formidable Gulf of
Desperation, and plunge them into the
bottomless Abysses of the lowest Hell.</p>

Sinners who despise the Offers of Thy
Mercy, shall become the Victims of
Thy implacable Vengeance, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
Thee in unimaginable Pains;
since Thou hast appointed a Season,
when an Eternity of Felicity, or
Misery, shall be the Reward of our
Actions; and we must either stand
or fall, according to our handy
Operations: Vouchsafe, that the
Contemplation of these weighty
Verities may be such a prevalent
Inducement to the Amendment of
our Lives, that we may <hi>work out
our salvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
Let not the pernicious Allurements
of this fraudulent World make us
negligent of the Wrath to come;
but let us walk with that aweful
Care, and vigilant Circumspection,
that we may appear with Joy, in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:109758:90"/>

part of mis-call'd <hi>Christians</hi> shall be

               <p>ETERNAL Death is the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
State of the Damned; by
which they are not only depriv'd of
the Presence of the Almighty, but are
also tormented with perpetual Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both in Soul and Body. Oh, how
horrid is it then, to incurr the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of the Divine Omnipotence!
How strangely infatuated are ye, O
senseless Sinners! to run on so swiftly
in the Ways of Sin! Tell me, Can
you freely receive your Wages, which

               <p>II. COULD we but obtain, by Divine
Permission, a Visionary Prospect of
that incorrigible Miscreant and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<hi>Iudas;</hi> what a Scene of Horror
would that be, to behold him, violently
dragg'd by Infernal Spirits, and loaded
with Chains of Fire; his Diabolical
Countenance, pale and Wan; the
Voice within him, his Conscience,
Worm-eaten; his Pestilential Skin,
cover'd with Leprosie, from whence
issues out Stinks not to be endured;
his Limbs and Body, wounded and
tormented; and his Tongue filled with
bitter Lamentations and Execrations;
What a dreadful Apprehension will
the Vision of so deplorable a Spectacle
create in thee!</p>
               <p>III. SHOULDST thou, in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
fix that dire Object before
thine Eyes; and upon a strict Disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
examine him, saying, <q>Tell
me, O thou perfidious <hi>Iudas!</hi> what
Griefs, what Pains and Torments
are these thou undergoest? What
number of Years has thou reign'd in
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:109758:91"/>
sulphurous Fire? And how many
Centuries of Ages must thou yet
remain buried in Flames, and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among the Infernal Crew?</q>
His guilty and amazing Conscience
would soon reply, <q>The Pains which
which I endure are intollerable; no
intermission for Relief is here to be
found, but the Torments thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inflicted
are perpetual: The least of
our Miseries far exceed all Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which either the Justice of
God, or the Cruelties of Men upon
Earth, did ever execute: Despair is
our continual Associate, and there
is no vacant Place for Hopes of ever
to be freed for these unexpressible
Torments: You upon Earth, take
your Ease, you Eat and drink in full
Bowls; whil'st we want Water to
cool our Tongues, which are tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
in these Flames.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IV. Let the Thoughts of Hell's
Terrors ever put me in a Method to
escape their Fury. Consider the
Damned in their fatal Circumstances;
their Life is, to die without expiring;
and their Death is, to live in perpetual
Punishment: There the Tormentor is

never wearied, the Fire never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes,
and the Torments never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.
And this Decree is according
as the irrevocable Sentence requires;
the fulfilling of the Justice of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
and the Reward due to wilful
Impenitents, and obdurate Offenders;
that they should never want a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
measure of Punishment, who
were continually glutted, and never
ceas'd from Sin.</p>
               <p>V. There, the least Sin has its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Punishment, wonderfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of its own Sordidness: The
Salacious shall inhabit in unextinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

The Epicure and Ebrious

to cool their Tongues: The Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and Passionate shall snarl like

Uncharitable shall corrode their own
Entrails: The Wealth of the Misers
shall be as Goads in their Sides; and
the Arrogant and Ambitious shall be
hurried down from the Precipice of
Scorn, to the Bottomless-Pit of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
The Infatuated shall miserably

               <p>VI. BUT, O what strange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions
shall fasten on their Spirits,
and vulnerate and search the utmost
of their Souls! When they shall with
Amazement behold themselves eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
bereft of the illuminating Vision
of the Most Highest! When they shall
behold themselves eternally exil'd from
the joyful and amiable Presence of
Jesus; that Omnipotence who created
'em to inherit His Kingdom; that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
who purchas'd 'em to reign with
Him in Glory: then shall they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate
the Hour of their Nativity, and
those sordid Associates that enticed
them to Ruine! They shall exclaim
against the Folly of the fraudulent U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse;
and belch out, with a raving
Distraction, Are these the Products of
those infatuated Desires, whose empty
Enjoyments we esteem'd our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness!
Alas! what will our loose Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
and those fond Delights we
so eagerly chas'd after, now yield us?
What Happiness receive we from those
fleeting Honours, and transitory Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:109758:93"/>
we so highly valued? They are
all fled away as a Vapour, and past
away as a Morning-Cloud.</p>
               <p>VII. BUT the Sting and Torment
perpetually endures, and plagues our
Vitals with Everlasting Anguish. Thus
shall they roar out; but all is deaf to
their Complaint: Thus shall they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but no Compassion shall relieve
them. O dismal Spectacle of a wicked
Life! O terrible Sequel of a destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Death! perpetually to wish for
what they never can obtain! perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
to undergo that which is inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table!
<q>O magnify'd be Thy Divine
Omnipotence, that with such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
Affection gives us timely
Notice of our Ruine! Save us, O
blessed Lord! from all Impieties:
Oh, save us, for Thy Own dear sake!
Quicken our Minds against the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of Sin! and with Thy Fatherly
Corrections chastise us often, that
at last the Terrors of Hell may force
us into Thy Heavenly Kingdom!</q>

               <head>MED. XXVIII. Upon Heaven.</head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>Psal. lxxxvii. 2</bibl>
                  <q> Glorious things are
spoken of thee, thou City of God.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>BUT all the most exalted Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums
are infinitely below thy
deserved Lauds and Praises: For, What
Humane Understanding, What created
Tongue, can be able to comprehend
or express thy ineffable Excellencies?
If this Inferior Orb, the Place of our
Exilement, and a Theatre of inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Miseries, be so wonderfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful,
that our Eyes are entranced
with the Variety of its Objects, and
can never sufficiently admire the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
they behold; if the Firmament,
which is but a Foot-cloth for the Saints
to tread on, be enamell'd with so
many Starry Jewels, and imbellish'd
with such radient Planets, and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Constellations: How transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent!
how superlatively Magnificent
are the Inner Appartments and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of that Emperial Palace where
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:109758:94"/>
the Adorable Deity does vouchsafe to
communicate his Essential and Ecsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Glories?</p>
               <p>II. O DESIRABLE Mansion! One Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute's
Residence in thy Celestial Courts,
will make us more than Recompence
for all the Afflictions we can possibly
suffer in this Valley of Tears: And
And how conceivably will our Reward
be, when, by a Miracle of Divine Mercy,
we shall be admitted to an Everlasting
Participation of thy Immense and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible
Felicities! It was the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Hope of thy Enjoyment, which
animated the Primitive Martyrs to
sustain the most fiercest Tortures with
an undaunted Constancy, and to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
in the mid'st of their Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>III. THE comfortable Expectation
of thy Fruition, was the Grand Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
which induced the Magnanimous
<hi>Ignatius,</hi> when threatned by his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
with Extremity of Torments,
to make this Heroick Replication;
<hi>Fire, Gallows, Beasts, Breaking of my
Bones, Quartering of my Members,
Crushing of my Body, all the Torments
of the Devil together; let them come
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:109758:94"/>
upon me, so I may enjoy my Lord Iesus
Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. IT is an undeniable Axiom,
That all Secular Felicitities are built
upon brittle Foundations. The most
sublime Terrestrial Pleasures, even in
their greatest Complacencies, are but
transcient Vanities, and conclude in
Vexation; but the Objects of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Habitations are refined to such
an extraordinary degree of Perfection,
that they will be able to satiate the
most extended Desires of our capacious
Souls: There we shall possess, in lieu
of a living Mortality, which moves us
towards the Grave, a Vitality glorious
beyond Imagination, durable as the
Ages of Eternity, and whose Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will entitle us to excessive and
inexplicable Satisfactions.</p>
               <p>V. IF we admire Beauty: Our
ravish'd Eyes, in lieu of Corporeal
Objects, shall behold those Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Glories which flow from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Uncreated Light, and shall be
permitted to contemplate that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Clearness which proceeds from
the Beatifical Visage of the Supreme
Creator. If Riches be the Center of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:109758:95"/>
our Affections: Gold, Pearls, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
Rubies, Jewels, and whatever
we account most precious and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Universe, are but faint Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors
to describe the Inestimable
Treasures of the Supernal World.</p>
               <p>VI. IF Honour be the Subject of
our Ambition: What are Scepters and
Crowns, but Illustrious Miseries? What
are the Grandeurs upon Earth, but
gaudy Shadows, in comparison of those
Incorruptible Diadems, those perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and Substantial Dignities which
flourish Above. If we delight in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick:
There we shall hear the Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrical
Anthems of the Seraphick
Choir; and shall bear a part in the
solemn Celebration of that Almighty
Being, whose only Presence will be
sufficient to replenish us with immea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable
Felicity.</p>
               <p>VII. TO Conclude: Nothing can be
 ded to that Immensity of Beatitude
which we shall there enjoy; but we
shall be as perfectly Happy, as the
immediate Vision of the Incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensibly
Glorious Trinity, the Society
of Angels, the Conversation of Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Spirits, and the inexpressible
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:109758:95"/>
Accommodations of a blissful Heaven
can possibly make us.: And to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate
our Felicity, all our Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
shall be invested with Eternal
Glory.</p>
