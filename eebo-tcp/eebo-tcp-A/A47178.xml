            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>2 Cor. V. 14, 15.</bibl>
                  <p>For the Love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus Judge, that if one Died for all, then were all Dead. And that he Died for all, that they which Live, ſhould not henceforth Live unto themſelves, but unto him who Died for them, and Roſe again.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I Shall not take up much time to Explaine the Words of the Text, they being plain enough to ordinary intelligent Chriſtians, only I intend to take notice of the force of the Greek word that is here Tranſlated <hi>Conſtraineth,</hi> which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is variouſly Tranſlated in the New Teſtament; and tho' I find no fault with the Tranſlation of it, as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:66442:5"/>
it is in the Text, yet there is more underſtood by it, than what either the word <hi>Conſtraineth,</hi> or any other one word of the Engliſh Language can expreſs. A Learned Author Tranſlates it thus, <hi>The Love of Chriſt,</hi> nos totos poſſidet, i. e. <hi>Poſſeſſeth us whole</hi>; doth as it were, fill our Hearts up to the top, that there is no room left in them for the love of Sin.</p>
            <p>The ſame Greek word I find in St. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.45. where it is ſaid, <hi>The multitude Throng thee, and Preſs thee, and ſayeſt thou, Who Touched me?</hi> Again, in St. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.63. I find the ſame Greek word, where it is ſaid;, <hi>The Men that held Jeſus,</hi> i. e. That kept him Priſoner, <hi>Mocked him, and Smote him.</hi> And in St. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.43. there is the ſame Greek word, where it is ſaid, by our Saviour, who Propheſied concerning <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and was accordingly fulfill'd, <hi>For the days ſhall come upon thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that thine Enemies ſhall caſt a Trench about thee, and compaſs thee round, and keep thee in on every ſide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in St. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.38. where it is ſaid. Simon'<hi>s Wives Mother was taken with a great Fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Laſtly, to mention no more at preſent, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am in a ſtrait betwixt, two,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In all theſe places there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is the ſame word, or theme in the Greek, and in all the ſeveral Significations of it; in the places mentioned, it may be underſtood here, as importing the great influence that the Love of Chriſt hath upon ſincere Believers, and then had upon St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his Brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:66442:5"/>
               <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> i. e. It taketh the whole poſſeſſion of our Souls, and leaves no room empty, to receive the love of Sin. The love of Chriſt doth ſo throng and preſs upon us, that there is not acceſs for Satan, or the World, to prevail againſt us.</p>
            <p>The Love of Chriſt doth hold us, and make us Priſoners, putteth us in her Chains, that we cannot get out, no more than a Man can get out of a ſtrong Priſon; they are very Bleſſed, who by Experience witneſs ſuch a State, that the Love of Chriſt hath ſuch a powerful Influence, and ſuch mighty Effects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; thus to fill them; thus to throng and preſs in upon them; thus to impriſon them, and captivate them; ſuch Captivity is the greateſt and moſt perfect Freedom; thus to Beſiege and Compaſs them round, and keep them in on every ſide, that they cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily get to their old Lovers, their formerly belov'd Luſts, that the Love of Chriſt, like a Coelestial Fire, doth take hold of them (as a Fiery Fever taketh hold of ſuch as are afflicted with it) and raiſeth a vehement thirſt in them after Holineſs, and thoſe Divine Conſolations which are to be found in Chriſt: Such ſort of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Burning, or Fever, had the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.5. That is the Church, and every Faithful Soul that is very inwardly and deeply touched and affected with the Love of Chriſt, when ſhe ſaid, <hi>Stay me with Flaggons, comfort me with Apples, for I am ſick of Love.</hi> As when one is very Thirſty, it is not a little Drink
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:66442:6"/>
that will quench, or ſatisfy his Thirſt; no leſs than Flaggons will do it. Theſe, and the like things, are the experiences of faithful, well-grown and advanced Chriſtians; and they are Bleſſed who find it ſo to be with them; and all ſhould endeavour to attain to ſuch a State, and Growth.</p>
            <p>There are Three things, which I shall (God willing, and aſſiſting me) particularly take notice of, unto you, from the Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The High and Excellent Priviledge, and Dignity of a Chriſtian, that he is called unto; and his <hi>High Calling,</hi> as it is called, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. And <hi>Holy Calling,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. And <hi>Heavenly Calling,</hi> Heb. 3.1. The which is held forth in the words of the Text. 1. <hi>Negatively, That we ſhould not henceforth live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelves.—</hi> 2. <hi>Poſitively,</hi> and <hi>Affirmatively, But unto him who Dyed for us, and Roſe again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Author, by whome we are, called, and made capable to attain unto this high Dignity, <hi>viz.</hi> The Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who Dyed, and Roſe again, who is both God and Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Means by which he calleth us, and enableth us to attain unto it. 1. By his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> 2. By his <hi>Love,</hi> which was the moving and impulſive Cauſe, that moved and conſtrained him to Dye for us: As his Love to us ought to conſtrain us to Live to him, who Dyed for us, ſo his Love to us did conſtrain him to that undertaking; as he ſaid,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66442:6"/>
               <hi>Luke</hi> 12.50. <hi>I have <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Baptiſm to be Baptized with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed!</hi> Here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain is the ſame Greek word, as is mentioned both in the Text, and in the other places above recited; this was the Baptiſm of his Death and Sufferings, whereby he was Baptized, as with his own Blood, that he might waſh us with the ſame; as it is ſaid of him, <hi>That he hath loved us, and waſhed us from our Sins in his own Blood,</hi> Rev. 1.5. His being thus ſtraitned until this his Baptiſm of Sufferings ſhould be accompliſhed, doth ſignifie his exceeding great deſire, out of his great love to us, to ſuffer Death for us; as alſo, when he ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.15. <hi>With deſire I have deſired to eat this Paſſover with you before I Suffer</hi>: For then it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Paſſover, that he was to Inſtitute the Holy Memorials of his Death and Paſſion, to wit, the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> which was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue until his laſt coming.</p>
            <p>This Love of Chriſt, we are to conſider it as a two-fold Love, the one of his Godhead, the other of his Manhood; for as Chriſt had, and ſtill hath, a two-fold Nature, diſtinct, but not divided; and a two-fold Will, the one as God, the other as Man; ſo he had, and ſtill hath, a two-fold Love towards Men, called, the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropie, Tit.</hi> 3.4. i. e. His <hi>Man-Love,</hi> or his <hi>Love to Men,</hi> not only as he was, and is God, but as he was, and is Man, yet one Chriſt, in two diſtinct Natures, but undivided, and moſt Gloriouſly, and Inſeparably United for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:66442:7"/>It was an Ancient Hereſie, moſt juſtly Condemned above Twelve hundred Years agoe, by the Orthodox Fathers, That Chriſt had but one Will; from which they were call'd <hi>Monothelites,</hi> i. e. ſuch as did hold that Hereſie, That Chriſt had but one Will.</p>
            <p>They were alſo call'd <hi>Eutychians,</hi> from <hi>Eutyches,</hi> the Author of it. They conceited, that Chriſt's Manhood-Nature was tranſmuted, or melted into his Godhead-Nature; and conſequently, that the Will of his Manhood was tranſmuted, or melted into the Will of his Godhead, which is an abominable Error; for the Tranſmutation of any one Created Subſtance, into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Created Subſtance, is impoſſible; then ſurely as impoſſible is it, that the Subſtance of Chriſts Manhood can be tranſmuted, or changed into his Godhead.</p>
            <p>It is to be fear'd, that too many do not well Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, nor well and duly Meditate upon this two-fold Love of Chriſt, ſo as to have their Thoughts fix'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that it may have the greater influence upon them. If ye rightly underſtand, and conſider, and deeply ponder this two-fold Love of Chriſt, the one where with he loves you as God, (and that love of his is one and the ſame in nature with the Father's Love) and the other, wherewith he Loves you as Man, as he is now Glorified in Heaven, in the true intire Glorified Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, conſiſting of a Glorified Soul and Body, the ſame for Subſtance he had on Earth, tho' won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully changed in Manner and Qualities, yet no ways
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:66442:7"/>
changed in his Love towards Man, but rather heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened and increaſed, that will have a double force and influence upon you, much greater than if ye ſhould conſider his Love ſingly, either as he is God, or as he is Man.</p>
            <p>As they have not a right knowledge and belief of Christ, who only believe that he is God, and do not believe that he is Man alſo, and will not allow that his Manhood, having a created Soul and Body, is any part of him, whereof he conſiſteth, as the intire Chriſt, and Saviour: Nor have others a right knowledge and belief of Chriſt, who only believe that he is Man, and not God alſo, both ſuch ſorts of men have not the true Faith, but Err greatly, concerning the Faith; and too many of both ſorts are now in this Nation; ſo they have not a right knowledge and belief of the Love of Chriſt, who do not believe it in both reſpects above mentioned.</p>
            <p>Thus then we are with true Faith, Love, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, to conſider our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his two-fold Nature, as he is both God and Man; and as each Nature acted its part in the work of our Redemption, and that it behoved ſo to be, that the Author of our Eternal Salvation, ſhould be both God and Man: Had he not been Man, he could not have died for us, which the juſtice of Gods Law required, that he who ſhould be our Saviour ſhould dye for us, and undergo the Curſe that was due to us for our Sins, as accordingly he did; and had he not been God, his Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66442:8"/>
had not been of that Merit and Value before his Father, for our Reconciliation and Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>But yet more particularly, I think to lay before you how, and after what manner the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt, and alſo how, and after what manner the Love of Chriſt, are the effectual means whereby he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth true Believers to this high Dignity and Priviledge, and High, and Holy, and Heavenly Calling, not to live unto themſelves, but <hi>unto Him who Died for them, and Roſe again.</hi> His Death and Reſurrection are only expreſt in the Text, but by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> of the part put for the whole, his whole Active and Paſſive Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is underſtood, from his Deſcent and Conception in the Virgins Womb, to his Aſcenſion, and Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Heavens: But his Death, being a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part, that is it; which here, and elſewhere, is moſt frequently mentioned in Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Death of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, was an effectual means to advance us to this high Dignity above mentioned, that it was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Attonement for us, wherein he made a full and plenary ſatisfaction, to Divine Juſtice for our Sins; and did purchaſe and procure, by way of Merit, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, <hi>Having made Peace through the Blood of his Croſs, and having Reconciled us in his Body of Fleſh through Death, to preſent us Holy, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreproveable in his ſight,</hi> Col. 1.20, 21.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66442:8"/>
And by the Merit of his Death, having obtained the Remiſſion and Pardon of our Sins, for he dyed in our ſtead, the Juſt ſuffering for the Unjuſt; and being our Surety, he paid our Debt, and became a Curſe for us.</p>
            <p>But this is not ſo to be underſtood, that any are act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually Pardoned, Juſtified, or Reconciled unto God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Faith, and Repentance, and a real work of Converſion is wrought in them, but the Pardon was then purchaſed for all, tho' it is not given unto any, until they be actually Converted, and ſincere Faith and Repentance is wrought in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the Merit of our Saviours Death, and ſhedding of his precious Blood, did procure and purchaſe to us the Holy Spirit, with the ſaving and ſanctifying Graces thereof, by which he applieth to us the vertue and efficacy of the ſame for our Converſion, Regeneration, Juſtification, and Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>Now it was neceſſary that what Chriſt Did and Suffered for us, ſhould be done in Love, as accordingly it was done, in the higheſt Love, both to God, and alſo to us. As it was this his exceeding great and high Love, that made it ſo acceptable unto the Father, ſo it is the ſame that doth moſt effectually work upon our Hearts and Souls, to Love him, and to Live unto him <hi>who Died for us, and Roſe again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Apoſtle adds to Chriſt's Dying, his Riſing again, doth Inſtruct us, That his Reſurection was as neceſſary as his Death: If Chriſt had Died, and had
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66442:9"/>
not Roſe again from the Dead, he could not have been our Saviour; <hi>He was delivered for our Offences, and Roſe again for our Juſtification.</hi> He behoved to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Death, by riſing from the Dead, and not only by his Riſing, but by his Aſcending to the Father, he gave full evidence that what he Did and Suffered for the Sons of Men, was fully accepted by his Father; and that he was a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſmell unto God.</p>
            <p>But what ever Vertue, Merit, or Efficacy Chriſt's Death, and the Love which moved him to dye for us, hath before God, in order to procure or purchaſe our Reconciliation with God, Pardon and Juſtification, and the Grace of Sanctification, yet it hath not that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon us, or any, to cauſe us to live to him, and to God through him, but as his Death and Sufferings, and Love, which moved him to dye for us, are made known to us.</p>
            <p>In the time of our Ignorance of this great Myſtery, how <hi>God ſo loved us, that he gave his only Begotten for us; the Word to be made Fleſh, and God manifeſt in the fleſh</hi>; and how <hi>Chriſt ſo loved us, that he gave himſelf for us</hi>; who, as he was the Father's Gift, was alſo his own Gift to us; he gave himſelf for us, to redeem us from all Iniquity: Before this Love, and the great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, upon our bleſſed Lord, were made known to us, we felt not that influence of it upon our Hearts, to move us to live to him; but while we were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of thoſe things, we lived to our ſelves, and to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:66442:9"/>
World. Life and Immortality was to be brought to the Light of our Knowledge; the Kindneſs and Love of God our Saviour, was firſt to appear to us, and come to our knowledge, before we could be gained upon to Love him, and to Live to him, <hi>who Died for us, and Roſe again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the next thing that is to be Enquired, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved is, How this great Myſtery of Chriſt's Death, and his great Love, that moved him to lay down his Life for us, is made known to us.</p>
            <p>This Queſtion I ſhall Anſwer in the following Particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Chriſt's Death, and Love, wherewith <hi>he ſo Loved us, that he died for us,</hi> is made known to us by the Doctrine of the Goſpel, more eſpecially as it is Preach'd to us, and alſo as we Read, or hear it Read to us out of the Holy Scriptures, <hi>Life and Immortality is brought to light by the Goſpel,</hi> 2. Tim. 1.10. The Myſtery which was hid in God, before the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, came to be gradually reveal'd; after <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, firſt more obſcurely; and implicitly, but afterwards more clearly, and explicitly, by the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26. And Laſtly, moſt clearly and explicitly, by the whole Scriptures, both of the Old and New Teſtaments, all which are given by Divine Inſpiration, and are able to make us Wiſe unto Salvation, through Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16. Both conſiſting in excellent Harmony; and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:66442:10"/>
the New Teſtament being both a Fulfilling and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Old Teſtament.</p>
            <p>The great deſign of the Scriptures, both of the Old and New Teſtament, is to ſet forth the great Love of God to Men, in giving his Son for their Salvation; and alſo the great Love of Chriſt, who gave himſelf for the ſame: The way and manner how it is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, how this Love is the Love of the whole Trinity, and how each Perſon is concerned in the work of our Salvation, jointly and ſeverally; and of the Duty that Men owe to God, for that great Love, and to Chriſt, conſidered not as God only, but as God Incarnate, i. e. as both God and Man, having two Natures, as above mentioned, but one Perſon, one intire Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</p>
            <p>This commends to us the Holy Scriptures, Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably above all Writings of Men, above all Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Books of the greateſt Natural and Moral Philoſophers, whether Greeks or Romans, or of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever other Nations, whatever true things they Taught or Writ, either from true Reaſon, or common Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, aſſiſting and ſtrengthening their Reaſon, that might be, and were uſeful to Mankind, yet they fell ſhort of the diſcovery of this great Myſtery, <hi>That Chriſt ſo loved us, that he Died for us; and that he Died for us, that we might not Live to our ſelves, but to him who died for us.</hi> Nothing but <hi>ſpecial Revelation,</hi> ſuch as he gave to his holy Prophets from time to time, from the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66442:10"/>
of the World, in the gradual diſcoveries of it, and which are Recorded in the holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, could have given us this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and for this cauſe it is, that we ought highly to value the Holy Scriptures, as a ſpecial Treaſure, of greater worth incomparably than all the Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and Wealth and Riches of the whole World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſame is made known to us by the Holy Spirit's internal Illumination and Inſpiration, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us of the truth of the Holy Scriptures, and of thhis great Myſtery, <hi>That Chriſt ſo Loved us, that he Died for us,</hi> that is ſo fully Recorded in the Scriptures, and alſo opening our Underſtandings to underſtand it, and give us to ſee the great Riches, Glory, and Beauty of the wonderful Love, Wiſdom, Power, and Holineſs, and other the Glorious Attributes of God in the way of our Salvation, in all the various ſteps of it. God hath ſo appointed it, that by his Words as Outwardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by the Holy Prophets, by Chriſt, when he came in the Fleſh, and by his Holy Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, which are now on Record in the writings of the holy Scriptures, and by his Holy Spirit Inwardly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening and Inſpiring us, we ſhould be both Taught, and Helped to Believe and Underſtand Savingly, the great Myſtery of our Salvation; according to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 59.21. The words which God gave unto Chriſt, Chriſt hath given them to the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, and they have faithfully Recorded them; and by theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Holy Scripture, they are given to us, while
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:66442:11"/>
we daily hear them in Preaching and Reading, <hi>John</hi> 17.8, 20. And for this cauſe it is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Goſpel, <hi>The Power of God to Salvation, to every one that Believes</hi>; For that the Power of the Spirit of God accompanies the Doctrine of the Goſpel, to whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is Preached, to enable ſuch who hear it, both to Believe and Underſtand it; Faith is thereby offered unto them; and the Holy Spirit accompanying the Doctrine, offers his help to All who hear it; tho All do not receive it, yet many do, and ſhall. Chriſt ſtands at the door of your Hearts and knocks, as he ſaid to them of <hi>Laodicea, If any Man will hear my Voice, and open unto me, I will come in to him; and will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> This calling and knocking of Chriſt at the door of your Hearts, is both Outwardly by the Goſpel, as outwardly Preach'd, or Read; and Inwardly by his Spirit: The Word Outwardly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, is as the Hammer, but the Spirit Inwardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying, is the Hand that moves it.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould bring the ſtrongeſt Arguments to prove the Scriptures to be True, and of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſuppoſe they ſhould be as Demonſtrative as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Theorem in a natural Science, yet all this could produce no more than an Humane Aſſent, or Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit work together with the Word and Doctrine, Inwardly to ſeal to the Truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and work a Divine Faith in us of the Truth of them. For true Saving Faith is the gift and work of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:66442:11"/>
Gods Spirit and Power; It is by the Spirit's working, together with the written Word Preach'd, or Read, that we know the things that are freely given us of God.</p>
            <p>If any Object, What need of both? If we are Taught by the Word and Doctrine Outwardly, as delivered in the Holy Scriptures, what need we to be Taught by the Spirit Inwardly? Or if we be Taught by the Spirit Inwardly, what need we be Taught by the Word and Doctrine Outwardly? Is not the Inward Teaching of the Spirit, or Light within, ſufficient, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing? So ſome do Argue.</p>
            <p>To this I Anſwer, It is one thing what God could, or can do; it's far another thing what he is pleaſed to do. He could Teach us all without the written Word, as well as he Taught the Apoſtles, before the Word was committed to Writing, but he hath not ſeen meet ſo to do; he hath a regard to our Weakneſs: A School-maſter that is able, can Teach his Schollars without Books, but they cannot ſo well Learn without Books; therefore he Teacheth them with, and by Books, to condeſcend to their weak Capacity. When God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſpake from Heaven, by an Audible Voice to the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were ſo affraid, that they prayed that God would not Speak to them, <hi>viz.</hi> immediately, they were not able to bear it; but that God would ſpeak to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by <hi>Moſes</hi> to them; which was granted. Many who pretend to the ſame Inſpirations in Prophecy that the Apoſtles had, ſhould God Inſpire
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66442:12"/>
them, as he did them, in that Extraordinary and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous way and manner as he did the Prophets of old, they ſhould find, they could not be able to bear it; Such Miraculous &amp; Extraordinary Inſpirations that God gave to the Prophets, would be like new Wine in their old Bottles, that would burſt and break them aſunder. What God hath joyned together, we ought not to put aſunder; he hath ſo ordered it, moſt Wiſely and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, that the Spirit of God, as the principal Agent, ſhould Teach us, and work all Saving Knowledge and Faith in us, by the Written Word Preached, or Read, as his Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Death of Chriſt, and his Love in Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, is made known to us by the Holy Spirit, his Inſpiring and Imprinting into our Hearts a ſenſe of his Love; <hi>He ſheds abroad his Love into our Hearts by the Holy Spirit that he has given us</hi>; according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. Chriſt in his Prayer to his Father, St. <hi>John</hi> 17.26. Prayed in behalf of all that ſhould Believe in him to the end of the World, even for us, as well as for them who were then with him, <hi>That the Love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou haſt Loved me, may be in them, and I in them.</hi> It ought greatly to affect our Hearts, to conſider and think, that he had us in his Heart and Thoughts at that very time, when he prayed this Prayer to his Father; and he ſtill hath us in his thoughts, <hi>who ever Lives to make Interceſſion for us,</hi> that the Love wherewith the Father hath Loved us may be in us, and he in us: Not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66442:12"/>
that the Love wherewith the Father Loved the Son could be (ſtrictly and properly ſpeaking) contained in us, or comprehended by us; for that being an infinite Love, how could, or can it be contained in us, who are poor finite Creatures; or comprehended by us? How can a Finite thing contain that which is Infinite? But the Holy Spirit, which is called in Scripture, <hi>The Spirit of Love,</hi> worketh ſome Inward ſenſe and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Love of God and Chriſt, in the Soul, whereby the Soul that has this Inward ſenſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion may know it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Love of Chriſt is made known to us, and hath its Influence upon us, by his Infuſing and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring into our Hearts and Souls (If we be true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers) a vigorous and active Principle of Love and Charity, that becomes in us a Principle of a Holy and Vertuous Life, mightily inclining us to Love both God and Chriſt, and alſo to Love our Neighbours, and all Men, even our very Enemies, after the example of our Saviours Love. And we being acted by that Principle of Love, we are thereby enabled, with great freedom and readineſs, with great joy and chearfulneſs, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our reſpective Duties both to God and Man. This Principle of Charity Infuſed, or Inſpir'd into the Soul, is all one with that which is called, <hi>The Grace of God in the Soul,</hi> the Grace of Sanctification, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the Vertues in it; and tho' the Operations be various and manifold, yet they all proceed from one
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66442:13"/>
Root, Seed, and Principle. This Principle of God's Grace ſome do not diſtinguiſh it from the Holy Ghoſt, but hold it to be one and the ſame therewith; but this is a great Error, and dangerous. The Holy Ghoſt is one and the ſame God with the Father, and with the Son; the Grace of God, and the God of Grace, are diſtinct, as the Effect and the Efficient, the Gift and the Giver; Grace is weaker or ſtronger, greater or leſſer, hath its ſeveral meaſures; therefore it cannot be God himſelf, which is <hi>an Infinite Being,</hi> and hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Parts nor Paſſions, to whom nothing can be added, and from whom nothing can be diminiſhed. This Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Love that is in Believers, inclining them to Love God and Chriſt; it is, ſo to ſpeak, the reflection, ſhadow, or image of the Love of God, and of Chriſt, towards us; As when we look into a Looking-Glaſs, the Glaſs reflects the image, or ſhadow of the Face back again upon the Beholder, the which image hath a likeneſs to the Original, but is as far ſhort of it, as a ſhadow is to the Body, or Subſtance, whoſe ſhadow it is: Or like the Echo, which is nothing but the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Voice, or Word of the Speaker. Therefore it is that St. <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>We Love him, becauſe he hath Loved us</hi>; our Love to him being the reflection of his Love to us, and as it were, the Daughter; and his Love to us, as the Mother.</p>
            <p>But to the end that his Love may work this power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful constraint upon us, it muſt not only be known by us,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:66442:13"/>
but after it is known, we muſt (by the help of the Holy Spirit which is given to us) frequently Meditate upon it, and upon the Death of Chriſt, which his Love conſtrained him to undergo for us; that by frequent Meditation thereof, we may have it fixed in our Hearts, and become as a burning Fire in us, according to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.4. <hi>My Heart was hot within me, while I was Muſing</hi> (i. e. Meditating) <hi>the Fire Burned.</hi> This is alſo clear from the words in the Text; <hi>The Love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge.</hi> 
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>God Almighty is pleaſed to work upon our Hearts by his Goſpel Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and by his Spirit Inwardly, as we are Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creatures, enabling us to form a ſound and firm Judgment of things, both of Cauſes and Effects; and to view and conſider the excellent Order and Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, that the Wiſdom of God hath appointed. Had God only infuſed a Spiritual and Supernatural Principle of Grace into our Hearts, mightily inclining us to Love and Obey him, without affording us cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Arguments and Reaſons, Convincing and Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Reaſonable Underſtandings why we ſhould ſo do, on that ſuppoſition our Love and Obedience had not been ſuch a rational and free Love and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſuiting our rational Nature and Faculties, as now it is, he having given us moſt excellent Arguments and Reaſons why we ſhould ſo do; the greateſt of which are taken from theſe words, which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Text, <hi>Becauſe God ſo Loved us, that he gave
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:66442:14"/>
his Son for us unto Death</hi>; and Chriſt ſo Loved us, that he gave himſelf to Die for us; therefore we ought to Love him, and Serve him, and Live to him, <hi>who Died for us, and Roſe again</hi>; and alſo to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, through him, and with him. Chriſt's Dying for us, is ſuch an Argument why we ſhould be wholly his, and wholly Love him, and Live to him; That it is our Duty ſo to do, not only in point of Gratitude, but in point of Juſtice; and this both St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> did argue, with them to whom they writ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>For ye are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God in your Body and in your Spirit, which are God's.</hi> And v. 19. <hi>Ye are not your own.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>For as much as ye know ye were not Redeemed with Corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, from your vain Converſation, received by Tradition from your Fathers, but with the precious Blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without Blemiſh and without Spot.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Who his own ſelf bore our Sins in his own Body, on the Tree, that we being Dead to Sin, ſhould Live unto Righteouſneſs, by whoſe Strength ye are Healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Love and Bounty of God in our Creation and Preſervation, and all the Bleſſings of this Life, are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments very convincing and perſwading, why we ſhould Serve and Glorifie God; and the conſideration of his Glorious Greatneſs, and Power, in his Creating all things, and Upholding them, and of his moſt Wiſe, and Juſt, and Powerful Providence, in the Government of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66442:14"/>
the World, obvious and apparent to the Eyes of all Mankind, ought greatly to move all Men to Fear, and Reverence him, as well as to Love and Serve him, to their utmoſt ability and knowledge. But the Light of the Goſpel, wherewith God has been pleaſed to enlighten us Chriſtians, not only furniſheth to us all theſe Arguments, taken from the Power, Wiſdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Juſtice of God, and other his Glorious Attributes that are clearly to be ſeen by his works of Creation and Providence, obvious to Heathens, both more clearly and abundantly out of the Holy Scriptures; but with greater Arguments than theſe, taken from the great work of our Redemption, by Chriſt's Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It moveth us to Love and Fear God, and Live to him, and to Chriſt who Died for us; and is both his own, and the Fathers Gift unto us, moſt freely given, for our Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>But that the Argument taken from the Death of Chriſt may be the more effectual to perſwade us to Live to him who Died for us, let us Conſider the excellent way of the Apoſtles Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here in the Text, which he doth from the Extent of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>we thus judge, that if one Died for all, then were all Dead.</hi> There are ſome that ſay, <hi>Chriſt Died not for all, but for ſome</hi>; to wit, ſuch only as ſhall be Converted, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, to the end of it; and by <hi>his Dying for all,</hi> they ſay, muſt be meant <hi>Genera Singulorum,</hi> but not <hi>Singula Generum</hi>; i. e. all kinds of Men, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks, Scythians</hi> and <hi>Barbarians,</hi> Noble and Ignoble, Bond and Free; but not all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals of Men. But this cannot be the meaning here, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Apoſtles Argument would not be Convincing, <hi>Becauſe Chriſt Died for All, therefore All were Dead</hi>; The word <hi>All,</hi> in the Propoſition, muſt have the ſame Signification with the word All in the Concluſion, which is deduced from the Propoſition, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argument would not be Logical, and ſufficient. Now the word All in the Concluſion, ſignifies all Individuals of Mankind. All are Dead in <hi>Adam</hi>; Death both Spiritual and Temporal is come upon all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, by his Sin and Fall,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66442:15"/>
which the Apoſtle here proves from this, That Chriſt Died for All, for if All had not been Dead in Sin and Tranſgreſſion, as well as ſubject to Bodily Death, Chriſt had not Died for All, for it was not needful that he ſhould Die for them, who were not Dead.</p>
            <p>It is a good Rule in Divinity, That the words of Scripture ought to be underſtood in their proper and full Signification and Extent, except ſome neceſſary Reaſon can be given to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which cannot be given in this caſe. But divers ſtrong Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can be given, why they ſhould be underſtood as above mentioned: By Chriſt's Dying for All, an offer is made unto All, to whom the Goſpel is Preached, to receive that high Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Priviledge to which they are called, and without this Univerſal Offer to All, who have the Goſpel Preach'd unto them, a ground of Doubt would be laid, whether this Love extends to us, if it doth not extend to All; as it is ſaid in the 17th Article of the Church of England, <hi>We muſt receive Gods Promiſes in ſuch wiſe as they be generally ſet forth to us in Holy Scripture.</hi> But to teach, that Chriſt Died not for All, is (I think) ſome hinderance for us to receive Gods Promiſes in ſuch wiſe as they be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſet forth in Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>It is true, all have not Salvation by Chriſts Death, even to whom it is Preached; but who have it not, it is their own fault. Nor are the Benefits of Chriſts Death equally extended to All. And tho' I believe, according to the Holy Scripture, That there is a Predeſtination to Life, yet I no where find in Scripture, that God by any abſolute Decree hath made Salvation impoſſible to any part of Mankind; for ſuch an abſolute Decree were utterly inconſiſtent with Chriſts Dying for all Men. The Decrees of God, ſome are Abſolute, and ſome are Conditional: I mean Conditional, not Subjectively, but Objectively, i. e. Not that there are two Wills or Decrees in God, the latter depending upon the former Conditionally, but by one and the ſame Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Act of Gods Will and Purpoſe, he hath Decreed ſuch an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Cauſes and Effects; and of ſome things to follow after
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66442:15"/>
others Conditionally, that will, or will not come to paſs, as the Conditions do, or do not goe before; as Plowing and Sowing, before Reaping; Repentance and Faith, before Remiſſion of Sins, and Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhown, That the Death of Chriſt, as having Died for All, will be the more effectual to work upon us, by the Grace of God, to move us to Live to him who Died for us; That we believe he Died for all, and Conſequently for us; and that in Love to all. Let me a little yet further ſet forth his Love to us, that it may have its Influence upon us: <hi>Greater Love hath no man than this,</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>that a man lay down his Life for his Friends,</hi> John 15.13. <hi>But God commended his Love to us, in giving his Son to Die for us, who were Enemies,</hi> Rom. 5.8, 9, 10. If you ask, How were we Enemies, when Chriſt Died, ſeeing we were not Born many Years after that Chriſt Died? I Anſwer, We were Enemies as in the Loins of our Forefathers; Not only up to them who were then Living, but up to our Forefather <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Scripture teſtifieth; <hi>That in</hi> Adam <hi>all are Dead; and by the offence of One, Condemnation is come upon All.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Love of Chriſt towards Men, exceedeth all Examples; as <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s Love, <hi>It exceeded the Love of Women.</hi> It may be ſaid of Chriſts Love to us Men, Sinners and Enemies, it exceedeth all Examples, either in Scripture or elſewhere, as of that Grecian <hi>Zaleucus,</hi> King of the <hi>Locretians,</hi> who, both to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Juſtice of the Law, and ſhew his Love to his Son, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with one of his Eyes, that his Son might not loſe both his Eyes, which was the Penalty that the Law required for his Sons Crime of committing Adultry. As alſo that Example of <hi>Codrus</hi> King of <hi>Athens,</hi> who being told by the Oracle, That if he was Kill'd by the <hi>Peloponeſians,</hi> who had Beſieg'd <hi>Athens</hi> with a mihg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Army, the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſhould Overcome; and that by his Death they ſhould Live: Whereupon he put off his Royal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, and put on the Habit of a Common Souldier, and ruſhed into the Battel where it was hotteſt, and was Kill'd; after which, according to the Oracle, the <hi>Athenians</hi> had the Victory, and the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:66442:16"/>
Enemy was Routed. This he did out of Love to his Subjects, as what the other did was out of Love to his Son; but what our Bleſſed Lord Did and Suffered, was out of Love to his Enemies; who being in the form of a God, and counted it no Robbery to be Equal to God, but made himſelf of no Reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He did not (properly ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) denude himſelf of his Glory, that being impoſſible, being Eſſential to him as God, but he hid it within the Vail of his Fleſh, and gave up himſelf moſt willingly and freely to Suffer for us; ſuch was his Love to us, that conſtrained him thus to Die for us; and therefore his Love ought to conſtrain us to Live not to our ſelves henceforth, after that his Love in Dying for us is made known to us, <hi>but to him who Died and Roſe again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place I intend, as Briefly as I can, to ſhew you,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What it is not to Live to our Selves. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> What it is to Live to him who Died for us, and Roſe again, according to the words of the Text, which I ſhall deliver in the following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not to Live to our ſelves, is, not to Live to any Beaſtly Luſts of Uncleanneſs or Senſuality.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not to gratifie our Outward and Bodily Senſes in things that are materially Lawful, ſo as to make that gratification the end of our Living, which makes Men no better than ſome more tame and innocent ſort of Beaſts; and yet how many do ſo? As if they liv'd only to gratifie their outward Senſes, as their Sight, in pleaſing it with Viſible Objects, as fine Houſes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, and Gardens; their Hearing, with delightful Muſick; their Taſte, with delicious Meats and Drinks; their Smelling, with odoriferous Perfumes and Smells; their Feeling, with Soft Raiment, and ſoft Beds of Down, which are commonly the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of ſome that are Rich in this World, as if they were born, and did live in the World only to gratifie the Senſual Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Not to make the higheſt gratifications of our Reaſons in the higheſt Knowledge of Natural things, our End and Felicity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Not to make our higheſt Knowledge, even in Spiritual
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66442:16"/>
Things and Myſteries, our Objective Happineſs and Felicity; for that is to put our Knowledge in the Place of God himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his Gifts in the room and place of the Giver, which ought not to be, for it is a ſort of Spiritual Idolatry: Our formal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs doth indeed partly conſiſt in the knowledge of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun here, and perfected hereafter, and in the fruition of him by Love and Joy; but we muſt not make either of them the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Happineſs, but God alone, in, and through, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Jeſus Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit, our ſupreme and higheſt Good.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Not to make our own Will and Pleaſure our End and Aim, but wholly to ſubmit our Wills to the Will of God, in all things; and wholly to truſt in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To Live to him, who Died for us, is</p>
            <p n="1">1. To Live a Life of Love to God and Chriſt, and from that Love to Serve and Obey him, in all his Commandments, with all ſincere Reſolutions and Endeavours to keep and obſerve them all our days, by our continual endeavouring to attain more and more to a Conformity to him, imitating his Vertues and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons daily more and more, like a Schollar, that every day Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after his Copy, Writeth better and better, tho' ſtill he comes not up to the perfection of his Copy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To Live to God and Chriſt, is to live a life of Communion and Fellowſhip with God and Chriſt, and in a true and real En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Life was manifeſted, and we have ſeen it, and declared it unto you,</hi> (which Life is Chriſt, both God and Man) <hi>that ye may have fellowſhip with us; and truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and the Son.</hi> The which Fellowſhip and Enjoyment is actually begun here, and tobe perfected here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, in the World to come.</p>
            <p>The Fellowſhip that the Faithful have with God and Chriſt here in the Mortal Body, and the Enjoyment they have of God and Chriſt, tho' it is not either in that immediate, or clear and perfect manner as it ſhall be in the World to come, yet it is a true and real Fellowſhip and Communion with God and Chriſt,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66442:17"/>
and alſo with the Holy Spirit; and a real Divine Enjoyment, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording an incomparable inward joy, ſweetneſs, and ſatisfaction to ſuch who really have it. Nor ought the Falſe and Counterfeit Pretences of too many, who boaſt they have it, and yet their Vile Errors and Unchriſtian Practices ſufficiently prove they have it not, make any to disbelieve ſuch a thing, that is ſo great a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and Priviledge to the Faithful.</p>
            <p>The which Divine Enjoyment, and Communion with God, and Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit, is by an Inhabitation of the Holy and Bleſſed Trinity in the Faithful, as God hath Promiſed, <hi>I will Dwell in them, and Walk in them</hi>: And by real inward operations and communications of Grace, Vertue, and quickening and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Influences, generally given and imparted to the Faithful, in the frequent and diligent uſe of the ordinary means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Word and Sacraments, Meditation, Prayer; and in the daily and continual courſe of our Obedience to all Gods Commands; by theſe means, as by Conduits and Pipes, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Waters, i. e. Life and Vertue, flow into the Souls of the Faithful from Chriſt, and from God in Chriſt, in whom the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs dwells, and of whoſe Fulneſs we all receive, and Grace for Grace.</p>
            <p>The Beatifical Viſion, i. e. To ſee God in the ſame Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Clearneſs, and Perfection, as the Glorious Saints ſee him in Heaven, is reſerved for the Life to come; as God ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Thou canſt not ſee my Face and Live,</hi> our State of Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is not capable of it.</p>
            <p>The way and manner of Gods ſhewing himſelf to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in this ſtate of Mortality, is as <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.9. <hi>He looketh forth at the Windows, ſhewing himſelf through the Lattice</hi>: [That is] all the uſual and ordinary means of Grace above-mentioned; <hi>we ſee here but darkly, as in a Glaſs; for we walk by Faith, and not by Sight</hi>; i. e. Such a clear ſight as we ſhall have in the Future State.</p>
            <p>The Prophetical Viſion, even of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any others, did not amount to the Beatifical Viſion; but was preſented by ſome Mediums, ſometimes External, and ſometimes Internal, to their outward, and inward Senſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:66442:17"/>The which Communications of the Spirit, being generally received in the uſe of the Word and Sacraments, and other Holy Duties; as Wine, or any other Cordial, is received into the Mouth by ſome Veſſel, yet the Veſſel goes not into the Stomach to nouriſh the Body, but the Wine, or Cordial; ſo it is the Life and Vertue that is conveyed by the outward Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that Nouriſheth and Feedeth, Refreſheth and Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth the Soul; and is like the Bread and Water that the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> received by the Angel, in the ſtrength whereof he was to go Forty Days. The like inward Comfort and Strength the Reverend Hearers of the Word, and Worthy (i. e. duly Qualified) Receivers of the Lords Supper, do experience, which will abide with them for many days, and for ever.</p>
            <p>I do therefore recommend to you, the Diligent and Frequent Uſe of all the means of Grace, with earneſt Prayer to Almighty God, for his Grace, and help of his Spirit to make them effectual. Hear the Word with Reverence, receive it with Meekneſs and Love; Meditate upon it, and after ye have heard it in Publick, recollect, and call it to remembrance in Private. And ye that are Maſters of Families, call your Children and Servants to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what they remember of it, that it may be more deeply engrafted and rooted in all your Hearts, and bring forth fruit in you. And thus going on, and walking in a continual courſe of Holy Duties, and Holy Living, we ſhall go from Strength to Strength, until we appear before God in Zion, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heavenly Zion above, where God is to be ſeen Face to Face.</p>
            <p>And may we all feel the Love of Chriſt, more and more to <hi>Conſtrain us to</hi> Love him, and <hi>Live to him, who Died for us,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we come to be with him, where he is, to behold his Glory, and have a full Enjoyment of him. Which God grant, for Chriſts ſake. Amen.</p>

However this their Cheat and Abuſe hath this Service, That thereby they declare, in the face of the Nation, that they are ſtill chargeable with theſe Errors, and that Uncharitableneſs, which, I thank God, I have Retracted. And it is an evidence, that their Cauſe and Caſe is bad, when they have no better Weapons wherewith to fight againſt me, but the Errors which I have Retracted, and which they ſtill hold, with many more, and much greater, whereof I never was guilty, and which I have proved them guilty of, in my Fourth Narative, Printed this preſent Year 1700, in above Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Fifty Quotations, faithfully Collected out of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd Authors, to which they have given no Reply, nor are ever like to give to any purpoſe, nor to divers others I have Publiſh'd againſt them.</p>
            <p>What Blindneſs, and Hardneſs of Heart, and Obſtinacy hath befallen them, who inſtead of Retracting their own Errors, or ſeeking to clear themſelves thereof, ſeek to Defame and Abuſe me, for my Retracting mine! But the Abuſe and Shame they caſt out againſt me, falls upon themſelves.</p>
