            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This Poem was calculated only for the Meridian of some private friends, not daring to gaze in the face of the World, because it's neer kin to truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to danger. Nor did the Author desire so to strumpet his Muse, as to prostitute her to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of every one, being not ambitious of the airy title of a Poet. Neither let it present it selfe to your eye the lesse worthy, because now martyr'd by the Presse, though it be become now so adulterated with false and scandalous <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> that it is a dishonour for a legitimate phantasie to derive a title from thence. My humble request to your Worship is, that you will vouchsafe to inrich

               <l>BUt an unbias'd reason may suppose</l>
               <l>Which side, by th' Sword, does prove victorious;</l>
               <l>Will so insult o're his inslaved foe,</l>

               <l>Of leaning to't, though in it selfe most good,</l>
               <l>Will without Law or Reason be withstood.</l>
               <l>Which side soe're doth rise by to'thers fall,</l>
               <l>Will still remain too great, and that too small:</l>
               <l>And such a victory it selfe will be</l>
               <l>A greater war, a longer miserie.</l>
               <l>For should the King prevail, 'tis to be fear'd,</l>
               <l>We justly are from Parliaments cashier'd:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61184:31"/>And without those what can we look for, lesse</l>
               <l>Then an untrue, or else a slavish peace?</l>
               <l>So while we pole away his naturall power,</l>
               <l>He's periwig'd with greater, then before.</l>
               <l>'Tis the best conquest, when the Prince is Lord</l>
               <l>Of's peoples hearts, by love, not by the Sword.</l>
               <l>For what's the King with a full pow'r to sway,</l>
               <l>When there are left no Subjects to obey?</l>
               <l>And if the war to th' States a conquest brings,</l>
               <l>Have at Prerogatives, and pow'r of Kings.</l>
               <l>For when the Realm is in confusion run,</l>
               <l>(As it must be, when ere the war is done,)</l>
               <l>The people, being victors, we shall find,</l>
               <l>As various in desires, as they're in mind:</l>
               <l>They'l be controlling still, and still aspire</l>
               <l>To limit Legall Pow'r, not their desire:</l>

               <l>From b'ing contented with't, as now they are.</l>
               <l>Both King and Magistrate must look to raign</l>
               <l>No longer then they do their wills maintain:</l>
               <l>And that <hi>Great Councell</hi> (if they did intend)</l>
               <l>Can't bring the stubborn people so to bend</l>
               <l>T' authority, that any King shall sway</l>
               <l>By fixed Lawes, they loyally obey;</l>
               <l>No more then Pilots on the stormy seas,</l>
               <l>Can guide their cap'ring vessells, where they please.</l>
               <l>So we (like fooles) while we do <hi>Scylla</hi> shun,</l>
               <l>Do headlongly into <hi>Charybdis</hi> run.</l>

               <l>HOw sad our Case is now! how full of woe!</l>
               <l>We may lament, but cannot speak, or know:</l>
               <l>Our God, in whom our peace, our plenty lay,</l>
               <l>In whom we liv'd, on whom we fixt our stay.</l>

               <l>That are our Gods, our Kings, our Kingdomes foes.</l>
               <l>And we're involved in so many evills,</l>
               <l>That men turn Souldiers, and the Souldiers devills:</l>
               <l>'Tis he that all this variance did bring,</l>
               <l>The King 'gainst us, and we against the King.</l>
               <l>A King, so good, so gracious, so divine,</l>
               <l>That (if 'twere possible) he doth out-shine</l>
               <l>The glory of his Ancestors, yet he</l>

               <l>Better ten thousands of his Subjects fall,</l>
               <l>Then he whose life's th' <hi>Enchiridion</hi> of all.</l>
               <l>Our Councell's thwarting, and our Clergy heady,</l>

               <l>That alwaies to the rising party run,</l>
               <l>Like shadowes, Ecchoes to the shining Sun.</l>
               <l>Religion rent with Shismes, a broken State,</l>

               <l>Quite prodigall o'th' guiltlesse blood they draw,</l>

               <l>Streets ring with swearing, one oath brings another,</l>

               <l>Which since we so desire, and cannot find,</l>

            <l>HOw much you may oblige, how much delight</l>
            <l>The wise and noble, would you die to night;</l>
            <l>Would you like some grave sullen <hi>Nictor</hi> die,</l>
            <l>Just when the Triumphs for the Victorie</l>
            <l>Are setting out; would you die now t' eschew</l>
            <l>Our Wreaths, for what your wisdome did subdue:</l>
            <l>And though they 're bravely fitted for your head,</l>
            <l>Bravely disdain to weare them till you are dead?</l>
            <l>Such <hi>Cynick</hi> glory would out-shine the light</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Grecian</hi> greatnesse, or of <hi>Roman</hi> height.</l>
            <l>Not that the wise and noble can desire</l>
            <l>To lose the object they so much admire:</l>
            <l>But Heroes and Saints must shift away</l>
            <l>Their flesh, ere they can get a Holy-day:</l>
            <l>Then like to Time, or Books feign'd Registers,</l>
            <l>Victors, or Saints, renown'd in Calenders,</l>
            <l>You must depart, to make your value knowne;</l>

            <l>So curst a Fate hath humane excellence,</l>

            <l>Great vertue may be dang'rous; whilst 'tis here,</l>
            <l>It wins to love, but it subdues to feare:</l>
            <l>The mighty <hi>Iulius,</hi> who so long did strive</l>

            <l>Till they grow greater by removing hence:</l>
            <l>Like Subjects, here they but attend the Crowne,</l>
            <l>Yet swell like Kings Companions when they're gone:</l>
            <l>My Lord, in a dull calme the Pilot growes</l>
            <l>To no esteem for what he acts or knowes,</l>
            <l>But sits neglected, as he uselesse were,</l>

            <l>For with a storm we all are over-cast,</l>
            <l>And Northerne stormes are dangerous when they last.</l>
            <l>Should you now die, that only know to steere,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>I'Ve been Sir, where so many Puritans dwell,</l>
               <l>That there are only more of them in Hell:</l>
               <l>Where silenc'd Ministers enough were met</l>
               <l>To make a Synod; and may make one yet.</l>
               <l>Their blessed liberty they've found at last,</l>
               <l>And talk'd for all those years of silence past.</l>
               <l>Like some half-pin'd, and hunger-starved men,</l>
               <l>Who when they next get victualls, surfet then.</l>
               <l>Each Countrey of the world sent us back some,</l>
               <l>Like severall winds, which from all quarters come,</l>
               <l>To make a storme: As't haps, 'tis Sunday too,</l>
               <l>And their chief <hi>Rabbies</hi> preach. To Church I go,</l>
               <l>VVhere, that we men more patiently may heare</l>
               <l>Non-sense, to God at first he speaks it there.</l>
               <l>He whines now, whispers straight, and next does roare,</l>
               <l>Now drawes his long words, and now leaps them o're.</l>
               <l>Such various voices I admir'd, and said,</l>
               <l>Sure all the Congregation in him praid.</l>
               <l>'Twas the most tedious Soule, the dullest he,</l>

               <l>Flesh'd here with this escape, boldly to th'Hall</l>
               <l>I venture, where I meet the Brethren all.</l>
               <l>First there to the grave Clergie I am led,</l>
               <l>By whatsoever title distinguished,</l>
               <l>Whether most reverend Batchellors they bee</l>
               <l>Of Art, or reverend Sophs, or no Degree.</l>
               <l>Next stand the wall-eyed Sisters all a row,</l>
               <l>Nay their scald-headed children they come too:</l>
               <l>And mingled amongst these stood gaping there,</l>
               <l>Those few Lay-men that not o'th' Clergy were.</l>
               <l>Now they discourse; some stories here relate</l>
               <l>Of bloodie Popish Plots against the State:</l>
               <l>VVhich by the Spirit, and providence, no doubt,</l>
               <l>The men that made have found most strangely out.</l>
               <l>Some blame the King, others more moderate, say,</l>
               <l>Hee's a good man himself, but led away:</l>
               <l>The women rip old wounds, and with small teares</l>
               <l>Recount the losse of the three Worthies Eares.</l>
               <l>Away you fooles, 'twas for the good o'th men;</l>
               <l>They nere were perfect <hi>Round-heads</hi> untill then.</l>
               <l>But against Bishops they all raile; and I</l>
               <l>Said boldly, I'de defend the Hierarchy:</l>
               <l>To th'Hierarchy they meant no harm at all,</l>
               <l>But root, and branch for Bishops; to't we fall;</l>
               <l>I like, a foole, with reason, and those men</l>
               <l>VVith wrested Scripture: a slie Deacon then</l>
               <l>Thrust in his Eares, so speakes th' Apostle too:</l>
               <l>How speakes hee friend? not i' th' nose like you.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:61184:36"/>Strait a She-zealot raging to me came,</l>
               <l>And said, o'th what d' you call it party I am;</l>
               <l>Bishops are limbs of Antichrist, she cries:</l>
               <l>Repent, repent, good woman, and be wise,</l>
               <l>The Devill will have you else, that I can tell,</l>

               <l>An hidious storm was ready to begin,</l>
               <l>When by most blessed Fate the meat came in,</l>
               <l>But then so long, so long a Grace is sed,</l>
               <l>That a good Christian when he goes to bed,</l>
               <l>Would be contented with a shorter prayer:</l>
               <l>Oh how the Saints injoy'd the creatures there!</l>
               <l>Three Pasties in the minute of an houre,</l>
               <l>Large, and well wrought, they root and branch devour,</l>
               <l>As glibly as they'd swallow down Church-Land;</l>
               <l>In vain the lesser Pies hope to withstand.</l>
               <l>On Geece and Capons, with what zeale they fed?</l>
               <l>And wond'ring cry, A goodly bird indeed!</l>
               <l>Their spirits thus warm'd, all the jests from them came,</l>
               <l>Upon the names of <hi>Laud, Duck, Wren</hi> and <hi>Lamb,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Canons and Bishops Sees; And one most wise,</l>
               <l>I like this innocent mirth at dinner, cries,</l>
               <l>Which now by one is done; and Grace by two;</l>
               <l>The Bells ring, and again to Church we go.</l>
               <l>Four Psalms are sung, (wise times no doubt they be,</l>
               <l>When <hi>Hopkins</hi> justles out the Liturgie)</l>
               <l>Psalms, which if <hi>David</hi> from his seat or blisse</l>
               <l>Doth heare, he little thinks they're meant for his.</l>
               <l>And now the Christian <hi>Bajazet</hi> begins;</l>
               <l>The suffering Pulpit groans for <hi>Israels</hi> sins:</l>
               <l>Sins, which in number many though they be,</l>
               <l>And crying ones, are yet lesse lond then he:</l>
               <l>His stretch'd-out voice sedition spreads afar,</l>
               <l>Nor does he onely teach, but act a war:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:61184:37"/>He sweats against the State, Church, learning, sence,</l>
               <l>And resolves to gain Hell by violence.</l>
               <l>Down, down ev'n to the ground must all things go,</l>
               <l>There was some hope the Pulpit would down too.</l>
               <l>Work on, work on good zeale, but still I say,</l>
               <l>Law forbids threshing thus o'th' Sabbath day.</l>
               <l>An hour lasts this two handed prayer, and yet</l>
               <l>Not a kind sillable from him can Heaven get,</l>
               <l>Till to the Parliament he comes at last;</l>
               <l>Just at that blessed word his furie's past:</l>
               <l>And here he thanks God in a loving tone,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Laud</hi>; and then he mounts: All's not yet done:</l>
               <l>No, would it were, think I, but much I feare</l>
               <l>That all will not be done this two houres here:</l>
               <l>For now he comes to, <hi>As you shall find it writ,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Repeats his Text, and takes his leave of it;</l>
               <l>And straight to his Sermon, in such furious-wise,</l>
               <l>As made it what they call't, an Exercise.</l>
               <l>The Pulpit's his hot Bath: the Brethrens cheere,</l>
               <l>Rost-beefe, Minc't-py, and Capon reek out here.</l>
               <l>Oh how he whips about six yeeres ago,</l>
               <l>When superstitious decency did grow</l>
               <l>So much in fashion! How he whets his fist</l>
               <l>Against the name of Altar, and of Priest!</l>
               <l>The very name, in his out-ragious heat,</l>
               <l>Poore innocent <hi>Vox ad placitum</hi> how he beat!</l>
               <l>Next he cuffs out Set-prayer, even the Lords,</l>
               <l>It binds the Spirit, he saies, as 'twere with cords;</l>
               <l>Even with-Whip-cords. Next must authority go,</l>
               <l>Authority's a kind of binder too.</l>
               <l>First, then he intends to breath himself upon</l>
               <l>Church government; have at the King anon.</l>
               <l>The thing's done straight, in poor six minutes space</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> have lost their place;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:61184:37"/>Nay with th' Apostles too it e'en went hard,</l>
               <l>All their authority two thumps more had mar'd;</l>
               <l>

               <l>And at th' malignant party flings his arme;</l>
               <l>Defies the King, and thinks his Pulpit full</l>
               <l>As safe a place for't, as the Knight does <hi>Hull.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>What though no Magazine laid in there be,</l>
               <l>Scarce all their Guns can make more noise then he.</l>
               <l>Plots, plots he talks of, jealousies, and feares.</l>
               <l>The politick Saints shake their notorious eares;</l>
               <l>Till time, long time (which doth consume and wast</l>
               <l>All things) to an end this Sermon brought at last.</l>
               <l>What would you have good soules? a reformation?</l>
               <l>Oh by all means; but how? o'th newest fashion;</l>

               <l>If Bishops have a Right Divine or no?</l>
               <l>Or can they sweep their doors, and shops so well,</l>
               <l>And for to cleanse a State as yet not tell?</l>
               <l>No; study and experience makes them wise,</l>
               <l>Why shold they else watch late, and early rise:</l>
               <l>Their wit so flowes, that when they think to take</l>

               <l>This is a Conventicle trick. What's next?</l>
               <l>Oh with the Churches solemne formes thei'r vext,</l>
               <l>The sign o'th Crosse the forehead must not beare,</l>
               <l>'Twas only you were born to plant signes there.</l>
               <l>No Font to wash native concupiscence in,</l>
               <l>You like that itch still of originall sin.</l>
               <l>No solemne Rights of Buriall must be shown,</l>
               <l>Pox take you, hang your selves, and you shall ha' none.</l>
               <l>No Organ; Idolls to the eare they be:</l>
               <l>No Anthemes; why? nay ask not them, nor me:</l>
               <l>Ther's new Church Musique found instead of those,</l>
               <l>The womens sighs tun'd to the Teachers nose.</l>
               <l>No Surplices; no? why none, I crave?</l>
               <l>They're of rags <hi>Rome,</hi> I think: what would you have?</l>
               <l>Lastly they'd preach too; let them, for no doubt,</l>
               <l>A finer preaching age they'l nere find out:</l>
               <l>They've got the spirit, fiery tongues they've, that's true;</l>
               <l>And by their talk those should be double too.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>OH times! oh manners! when the Church is made</l>
               <l>A prey, nay worse, a scorn, to ev'ry <hi>Cade</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And ev'ry <hi>Tyler:</hi> when the popular rage</l>
               <l>(The ages greatest curse) reformes the age;</l>
               <l>When reason is for Popery snppress'd,</l>
               <l>And Learning connted Jesuitism at least;</l>
               <l>When without books Divines must studious be,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:61184:39"/>And without meat keep hospitality;</l>
               <l>When men 'gainst ancient Fathers rev'rend daies</l>
               <l>That many-headed beast <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> raise,</l>
               <l>That <hi>Hidra</hi> which would grow still, and encrease</l>
               <l>But that at first it met an <hi>Hercules</hi>;</l>
               <l>When the base rout, the Kingdoms dirt, and sink;</l>
               <l>To cleanse the Church, and purge the fountaines think,</l>
               <l>They who whilst living waters they might take,</l>
               <l>Drink Belgian ditches, and the Lemnian lake;</l>
               <l>When th' Liturgy, which now so long hath stood</l>
               <l>Seal'd by five reverend Bishops sacred blood,</l>
               <l>Is left for nonsence, and but pottage thought;</l>
               <l>Pottage from Heav'n, like that to <hi>Daniel</hi> brought,</l>
               <l>Their broaths have such weeds mixt, and are so hot,</l>
               <l>The Prophets sons cry out, Death's in the pot.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Oh times, oh manners! but me thinks I stay</l>
               <l>Too long with them; and so much for to day:</l>
               <l>Hereafter more, for since we now begin</l>
               <l>You'l find we've Muses too as well as <hi>Pryn.</hi>
