            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A ſecond Conſideration of the Annotations of <hi>Hugo Grotius.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving in my late defence of the <hi>doctrine of the Goſpell,</hi> from the corruptions of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> been occaſioned to vindicate the <hi>Teſtimonys</hi> given in the Scripture to the Deity of Chriſt, from their <hi>exceptions,</hi> and finding that <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> in his Annotatios had (for the moſt part) done the ſame things with them, as to that <hi>particular,</hi> and ſome <hi>other</hi> important Articles of the Chriſtian faith, that booke of his being more frequent in the hands of <hi>Students,</hi> then thoſe of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> I thought it incumbent on me, to doe the ſame worke in reference to thoſe <hi>Annotations,</hi> which it was my deſigne to performe towards the writings of <hi>Socinus, Smalcius,</hi> and their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and followers. What I have been <hi>enabled</hi> to accompliſh by that <hi>endeavour,</hi> with what <hi>ſervice</hi> to the Goſpell hath been performed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, is left to the judgment of them who deſire <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Of my dealing with <hi>Grotius</hi> I gave a briefe account in my <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity,</hi> and that with reference to an <hi>Apology</hi> made for him, not long before. This hath obtained a new <hi>Apology</hi> under the name of a <hi>ſecond defence of Hugo Grotius;</hi> with what litle advantage ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>repute</hi> of <hi>Grotius,</hi> as to the thing in Queſtion, or of the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt himſelfe,</hi> it is judged neceſſary to give the enſueing account: for which I took the firſt leaſure <hi>houre</hi> I could obtaine, having things of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weight, dayly incumbent on me. The only thing of <hi>importance</hi> by me charged on thoſe <hi>Annotations</hi> of <hi>Grotius,</hi> was this; that the Texts of Scripture both in the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament and <hi>New,</hi> bearing witneſſe to the <hi>Diety,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt, are in <hi>them</hi> wreſted to other <hi>ſenſes</hi> and ſignifications, and the Teſtimonies given to thoſe <hi>grand truths,</hi> thereby eluded. Of thoſe of the firſt <hi>kind</hi> I excepted <hi>one,</hi> yet with ſome <hi>doubt,</hi> leaſt his expreſſions therein, ought to be <hi>interpreted</hi> according to the <hi>Analogy</hi> of what he had elſewhere delivered: of which afterwards.</p>
            <p>Becauſe that which concernes the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt will admit of the <hi>eaſyeſt diſpatch,</hi> though taking up moſt roome, I ſhall in the firſt place inſiſt thereon. The words of my charge on the <hi>Annotations,</hi> as to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:117957:3"/>
this head of the doctrine of the <hi>Scripture</hi> are theſe. <hi>The condition of theſe famous Annotations as to the ſatisfaction of Chriſt</hi> is the ſame. <hi>Not one Text in the whole Scripture, wherein Teſtimony is given to that ſacred truth, which is not wreſted to another ſenſe, or at leaſt the Doctrine in it, conceald and obſcured by them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being a matter of <hi>fact,</hi> and the words containing a <hi>crime</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the <hi>Annotations,</hi> he that will make a <hi>defence</hi> of them, muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſprove the <hi>Aſſertion</hi> by inſtances to the contrary, or elſe gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>matter</hi> of fact, evince it to be no crime. That which is objected in <hi>matter of fact, aut negandum eſt aut defendendum,</hi> ſayes <hi>Quintilian: lib. 5. cap. de refut:</hi> and <hi>extra haec in judiciis fere nihil eſt.</hi> In other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Patronus, neget, defendat, tranſferat, excuſet, deprecetur, molliat, minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, avertat, deſpiciat, derideat;</hi> but in matters of fact, the two firſt only have place. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> allows more particulars for an Apologiſt to divert unto, if the matter require it: he may ſay of what is objected, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>(Rhet. lib. 3. cap.</hi> 15.) all which in a plaine matter of <hi>fact</hi> may be reduced to the former heads. That any other <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology</hi> can or ought to take place in this, or any matter of the ſame <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance</hi> will not eaſily be proved. The preſent Apologiſt takes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe. Such <hi>ordinary</hi> paths are not for him to walke in. He tells us of the <hi>excellent</hi> booke that <hi>Grotius</hi> wrote <hi>de ſatisfactione Chriſti,</hi> and the expoſition of ſundry places of Scripture, eſpecially of divers verſes of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53: given therein; and then adds ſundry <hi>inducements</hi> to perſwade us, that he was of the ſame mind in his Annotations. And this is called a <hi>defence of Grotius.</hi> The <hi>Apologiſt</hi> I ſuppoſe knowes full well, what <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> they are, that are conſtantly pleaded for the <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of Chriſt, by them who doe <hi>beleive</hi> that doctrine. I ſhall alſo for <hi>once</hi> take it for granted, that he might without much <hi>difficulty,</hi> have obtained a ſight of <hi>Grotius Annotations;</hi> to which I ſhall only add, that probably if he could from them have <hi>diſproved</hi> the <hi>Aſſertion</hi> before mentioned, by any conſiderable <hi>inſtances,</hi> he is not ſo tender of the Prefacers <hi>credit,</hi> as to have concealed it on any ſuch account. But the Severalls of his plea for the <hi>Annotations</hi> in this particular, I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded are accounted by ſome, worthy conſideration; a breife view of them will ſuffice.</p>
            <p>The ſignall place of <hi>Iſ.</hi> 53. he tells us, <hi>he hath heard taken notice of by ſome;</hi> (I thought it had been probable the Apologiſt might have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of it <hi>himſelfe,)</hi> as <hi>that wherein his Annotations are moſt ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted;</hi> therefore on that he will faſten a while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who would not now <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:117957:3"/>
that the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> ſhould have entred upon the conſideration of thoſe <hi>Annotations,</hi> and vindicated them from the <hi>imputations</hi> inſinuated: but he knew a better way of <hi>procedure,</hi> and who ſhall preſcribe to him, what ſuits his purpoſe and propoſall.</p>
            <p>This I ſay is the <hi>inſtance</hi> choſen to be <hi>inſiſted</hi> on; and the vindication of the <hi>Annotations</hi> therein, by the <hi>interpretation</hi> given in their <hi>Author</hi> his <hi>booke de Satisfactione Chriſti</hi> is propoſed to conſideration. That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if not the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> himſelfe, may take notice of the <hi>emptineſſe</hi> of ſuch precipitate <hi>Apologyes,</hi> as are ready to be tumbled out, without due <hi>digeſtion,</hi> or conſideration, I ſhall not only <hi>compare</hi> the Annotations and that booke as to the <hi>particular</hi> place propoſed, and manifeſt the <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> with the <hi>other;</hi> but alſo to diſcover the extreame ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence and confidence, which lye at the bottome of his following <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi> to induce a <hi>perſwaſion,</hi> that the judgment of the man of whom we ſpeake, was not alter'd (that is, as to the interpretation of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures relating to the Satisfaction of Chriſt) nor is others in his Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, then in that booke; I ſhall compare the one with the other, by ſundry other inſtances, and let the <hi>world</hi> ſee how in the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant places conteſted about, he hath utterly deſerted the <hi>interpretations</hi> given of them by himſelfe in his booke <hi>de Satisfactione,</hi> and directly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up that which he did oppoſe.</p>
            <p>The Apologiſt binds me in the firſt place to that of <hi>Iſ.</hi> 53. which is <hi>uſhered</hi> in by the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
            <p>From 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. (ſaies the <hi>Apologiſt) Grotius informes us that Chriſt ſo bare our ſins, that he freed us from them, ſo that we are healed by his ſtripes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This thus <hi>crudely</hi> propoſed, <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelfe would graunt it, is little <hi>more</hi> then barely repeating the words; <hi>Grotius</hi> goes farther, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the word there uſed by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> is to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>tulit ſurſum eundo, portavit,</hi> and tells us that <hi>Socinus</hi> would render this word <hi>abſtulit,</hi> and <hi>ſo</hi> take away the force of the Argument from this place. To diſprove that inſinuation, he urges ſundry other <hi>places</hi> in the new Teſtament, where ſome words of the ſame importance are uſed, and are no way capable of ſuch a ſignification. And whereas <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinus</hi> urges to the contrary <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. where he ſaies <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifies nothing but <hi>auferre peccata, Grotius</hi> diſproves that <hi>inſtance,</hi> and manifeſts that in that <hi>place</hi> alſo it is to be rendred by <hi>tulit,</hi> and ſo relates to the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>That we may put this inſtance given us by the <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> to vindicate the <hi>Annotations</hi> from the crime charged on them to an <hi>iſſue,</hi> I ſhall give

which is ſolely; whether <hi>Grotius</hi> in his Annotations have not perverted the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of thoſe <hi>texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which are <hi>commonly,</hi> and moſt <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly pleaded</hi> as Teſtimonies given to the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt. But as to this particular place of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> the Apologiſt hath a farther <hi>plea,</hi> the ſumme whereof (not to trouble the Reader with the <hi>repetition</hi> of a diſcourſe ſo little to the purpoſe) comes to this head; that <hi>Grotius</hi> in his booke <hi>de Satisfactione Chriſti</hi> gives the <hi>myſticall</hi> ſenſe of the <hi>chapter,</hi> under which conſideration, it belongs to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his ſufferings; In his Annotations the <hi>literall,</hi> which had its <hi>immediate completion</hi> in <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> which was not ſoe eaſily <hi>diſcoverable</hi> or <hi>vulgarly taken notice</hi> of.

How the <hi>literall</hi> ſenſe of a <hi>place</hi> ſhould come to be leſſe eaſily diſcovered then the <hi>myſticall,</hi> well I know not.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117957:8"/>
other places, where the expiatory Sacrifice of Chriſt on earth, and the taking away of the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſinne, by <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> is evidently <hi>intended.</hi> So that notwithſtanding the <hi>conceſſion</hi> mentioned, I cannot <hi>ſee</hi> the leaſt <hi>reaſon</hi> to alter my thoughts of the <hi>Annotations,</hi> as to this buſineſſe in hand.</p>
            <p>Not further to abound <hi>in causá facili;</hi> in all the <hi>differences</hi> we have with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> about <hi>Chriſts</hi> dying for us, concerning the nature of <hi>Redemption, Reconciliation, Mediation, Sacrifice,</hi> the meaning of all the <hi>phraſes</hi> and expreſſions, which in thoſe things are <hi>delivered</hi> to us, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notator is generally on the <hi>apoſtate</hi> ſide throughout his <hi>Annotations:</hi> and the truth is, I know no <hi>reaſon</hi> why our <hi>Students</hi> ſhould with ſo much diligence and charge, labour to get into their <hi>hands</hi> the books of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Crellius, Smalcius,</hi> and the reſt of that <hi>Crew,</hi> ſeing theſe <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations,</hi> as to the moſt important heads of Chriſtian Religion, about the <hi>Deity, Sacrifice, Preiſthood,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>originall ſin, free will, Iuſtification &amp;c,</hi> afford them the <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>Marrow</hi> of what is ſpoken by them; ſo that as to theſe heads, upon the matter, there is nothing peculiar to the <hi>Annotator,</hi> but the <hi>Secular learning</hi> which in his Interpretations he hath <hi>curiouſly</hi> and gallantly interweaved. <hi>Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> makes ſport in his <hi>Amphitruo</hi> with ſeverall Perſons, ſome <hi>reall,</hi> ſome <hi>aſſumed,</hi> of ſuch likeneſſe <hi>one</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> that they could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne themſelves by any outward <hi>appearance;</hi> which cauſed various <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts</hi> and miſtakes between them. The <hi>Poets fancy</hi> rayſed not a <hi>greater ſimilitude</hi> between <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Soſia,</hi> being ſuppoſed to be <hi>different</hi> perſons, then there is a <hi>diſſimilitude</hi> between the <hi>Author</hi> of the booke <hi>de Satisfactione Chriſti,</hi> and of the <hi>Annotations,</hi> concerning which we have been diſcourſing, being one and the ſame. Nor was the conteſt of thoſe different perſons ſo <hi>like</hi> on another, ſo irreconcilable, as are <hi>theſe</hi> of this <hi>ſingle</hi> perſon, ſo <hi>unlike</hi> himſelfe in the ſeverall <hi>treatiſes</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And I cannot but thinke it ſtrange that the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine no <hi>ſurer meaſure</hi> to be taken of <hi>Grotius's</hi> meaning in his <hi>Annotations</hi> then his treatiſe of the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt doth afford, there being no two treatiſes that I know, of any <hi>different</hi> perſons whatever, about <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Subject, that are more at variance. Whither now any will be <hi>perſwaded</hi> by the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> to believe that <hi>Grotius</hi> was conſtant in his <hi>Annotations</hi> to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> delivered in that other <hi>treatiſe,</hi> I am not ſollicitous.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>reinforced</hi> plea of the <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> that theſe <hi>Annotations</hi> were not <hi>finiſhed</hi> by him, but only <hi>collections</hi> that he might after diſpoſe of; I am not concerned in it; having to <hi>deale</hi> with that <hi>booke</hi> of <hi>Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:117957:8"/>
that goes under his name; if they are <hi>none</hi> of his, it is neither on the <hi>one hand</hi> or other, of any <hi>concernment</hi> unto me. I ſay not this, as though the <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> had in the leaſt made <hi>good</hi> his former <hi>plea,</hi> by his new Exceptions to my <hi>evidence</hi> againſt it, from the <hi>Printers</hi> preface to the <hi>Volume</hi> of <hi>Annotations</hi> on the Epiſtles.

               </gap> 
               <hi>adverſaria on the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For how ill this agrees with the <hi>intention</hi> and words of the <hi>Prefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> a ſlight inſpection will ſuffice to manifeſt. He tells us, that <hi>Grotius</hi> had himſelfe publiſht his <hi>Annotations</hi> on the <hi>Goſpells,</hi> five yeares before: that at his departure from <hi>Paris,</hi> he left a great part of <hi>this volume</hi> (that is this on the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles)</hi> with a friend; that the <hi>reaſon</hi> why he left not <hi>opus integrum,</hi> that is, the <hi>whole volume</hi> with him, was becauſe the <hi>reſidue</hi> of it was not ſo <hi>written,</hi> as that an <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> could well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. That therefore in his going towards <hi>Sweden,</hi> he wrote <hi>that part againe with his owne hand,</hi> and ſent it backe to the <hi>ſame perſon</hi> (that had the former part of the Volume committed to him) from <hi>Hamburge.</hi> If the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> read this <hi>Preface,</hi> he ought, as I ſuppoſe to have deſiſted from the <hi>plea</hi> inſiſted on: If he did not, he thought aſſuredly he had much reaſon to <hi>deſpiſe</hi> them, with whom he had to do: But as I ſaid, herein am I not concerned.</p>
            <p>The Conſideration of the <hi>charge</hi> on the <hi>Annotations</hi> relating to their <hi>tampering</hi> with the <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> given in the <hi>Scripture</hi> to the <hi>Deity</hi> of Chriſt, being an other <hi>head</hi> of the whole, may now have place.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Summe</hi> of what is to this <hi>purpoſe</hi> by me affirmed, is, that <hi>in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations on the old and new Teſtament, Grotius hath left but one place gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Teſtimony clearly to the Deity of Chriſt.</hi> To this aſſertion I added both a <hi>limitation,</hi> and alſo an <hi>enlargment</hi> in ſeverall reſpects. A <hi>limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> that I could not <hi>perceive</hi> he had ſpoken of <hi>himſelfe, clearly</hi> on that <hi>one</hi> place. On ſuppoſition that he did ſo, I granted that perhaps <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> places more, might accordingly be interpreted. That this <hi>one</hi> place is <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 1. I expreſſely affirmed: that is the <hi>one place</hi> wherein, as I ſay, he ſpake not <hi>home to the buſineſſe.</hi> The defence of the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of <hi>Grotius</hi> conſiſts of ſundry <hi>diſcourſes.</hi> Firſt to diſprove that he hath left <hi>more</hi> then that <hi>one</hi> of <hi>John</hi> free from the <hi>corruption</hi> charged; he <hi>inſtances</hi> in that <hi>one</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1. wherein as he ſaith, <hi>he expreſſely aſſerts the Deity of Chriſt:</hi> but yet wiſely forſeeing, that this <hi>inſtance</hi> would not evade the <hi>charge,</hi> having been expreſſely <hi>excepted,</hi> (as to the preſent enquiry) and <hi>reſerved</hi> to further <hi>debate;</hi> he adds the <hi>places</hi> quoted by <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:117957:9"/>
in the <hi>expoſition</hi> of that place as <hi>Prov. 8. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. Iſa. 45. 12. &amp; 48. 13. 2 Pet. 3. 5. Col.</hi> 1. 16. from all which he concludes, that the <hi>Annotations have left more Teſtimonies to the Deity of Chriſt untampered withall and unperverted, then my aſſertion will allow;</hi> reckoning them all up againe <hi>Section the 10th.</hi> and <hi>concluding himſelfe a ſucceſſfull Advocate in this caſe, or at leaſt under a deſpaire of ever being ſo in any, if he acquit not himſelfe clearly in this.</hi> If his <hi>failure</hi> herein be evinced, by the courſe of his late writings <hi>himſelfe</hi> will appeare to be moſt concerned. I ſuppoſe then that on the view of this <hi>defence,</hi> men muſt needs ſuppoſe that in the <hi>Annotations</hi> on the places <hi>repeated,</hi> and muſtered a ſecond <hi>time</hi> by the <hi>Apologiſt, Grotius</hi> does give their ſenſe as bearing witneſſe to the <hi>Deity</hi> of Chriſt.

               <hi>That the word of God being all and every part of it of equall truth, that doctrine which is founded on five places of Divine writ; muſt by all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be acknoledged to be as irrefragably confirmed, as an 100 expreſſe places would be conceived to confirme it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. It is confeſſed, that not only <hi>five,</hi> but any <hi>one</hi> expreſſe Text of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117957:11"/>
Scripture, is <hi>ſufficient</hi> for the confirmation of any <hi>divine truth.</hi> But that <hi>five places</hi> have been produced out of the <hi>Annotations</hi> by the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt</hi> for the confirmation of the great truth pleaded about, is but <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,</hi> indeed there is no ſuch thing. The Charge on <hi>Grotius</hi> was, that he had <hi>depraved all but one;</hi> if that be no <hi>crime,</hi> the <hi>defence</hi> was at <hi>hand;</hi> if it be, though that <hi>one</hi> ſhould be <hi>acknowledged</hi> to be <hi>clear</hi> to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, here is no <hi>defence</hi> againſt that which was charged, but a <hi>ſtrife</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>that</hi> which was not. Let the <hi>places</hi> be conſulted, if the <hi>aſſertion</hi> prove true, by an <hi>induction</hi> of inſtances, the Crime is to be confeſſed, or elſe the <hi>charge denied</hi> to contain a crime: but</p>
            <p>Secondly he ſaies, <hi>That this charge upon inquiry will be found in ſome degree, if not equally, chargeable on the learnedſt and moſt valued of the firſt Reformers, particularly upon Mr. Calvin himſelfe, who hath been as bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly and injuſtly accuſed and reviled upon this account (witneſſe the booke intituled Calvino Turciſmus) as ever Eraſmus was by Bellarmine and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, or as probably Grotius may be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though this at the beſt be but a <hi>diverſion</hi> of the <hi>Charge,</hi> and no <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> yet not containing that <hi>truth</hi> which is <hi>needfull</hi> to countenance it, for the end for which it is propoſed; I could not <hi>paſſe</hi> it by. It is denied (which in this caſe untill further <hi>proofe</hi> muſt ſuffice) that any of the <hi>learnedſt</hi> of the firſt Reformers, (and particularly <hi>Mr. Calvin)</hi> are <hi>equally chargeable,</hi> or in any <hi>degree of proportion</hi> with <hi>Grotius,</hi> as to the Crime inſiſted on. <hi>Calvin</hi> being the <hi>man</hi> inſtanced in, I deſire the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologiſt</hi> to prove that he hath in all his <hi>Commentaries</hi> on the Scripture corrupted the ſenſe, of any Texts of the <hi>old Teſtament</hi> or <hi>new,</hi> giving expreſſe Teſtimony to the <hi>Deity</hi> of Chriſt, &amp; <hi>commonly</hi> pleaded to that end &amp; purpoſe. Although I deny not, but that he differs from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon judgment of moſt, in the interpretation of ſome few propheticall paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, judged by them to relate to Chriſt. I know what <hi>Genebrard</hi> and ſome others of that <hi>faction,</hi> raved againſt him; but it was cheifly from ſome <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> in his <hi>inſtitutions</hi> about the <hi>Trinity</hi> (wherin yet he is acquitted by the moſt learned of themſelves) &amp; not from his expoſitions of <hi>Scripture,</hi> for which they raiſed their Clamours. For the booke called <hi>Calvino Turciſmus,</hi> written by <hi>Reynolds</hi> and <hi>Giffard,</hi> the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> has forgotten the <hi>deſigne</hi> of it. <hi>Calvin</hi> is no more <hi>concerned</hi> in it, then others of the firſt Reformers; nor is it from any <hi>doctrine</hi> about the <hi>Deity</hi> of Chriſt in <hi>particular,</hi> but from the <hi>whole</hi> of the reformed Religion, with the Apoſtaſyes of ſome of that profeſſion, that they <hi>compare</hi> it with <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme.</hi> Something indeed, in a <hi>chapter</hi> or <hi>two,</hi> they ſpeake about the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> from ſome expreſſions of <hi>Luther, Melancton, Calvin</hi> and others:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:117957:12"/>
but as to <hi>Calvin's</hi> expoſitions of Scripture, they inſiſt not on them. Poſſibly the Apologiſt may have ſeen <hi>Pareus</hi> his <hi>Calvinus Orthodoxus,</hi> in an anſwer to <hi>Hunnius</hi> his <hi>Calvinus Judaizans;</hi> if not, he may at any time have there an account of this calumny.</p>
            <p>Having paſſed through the Conſideration of the two <hi>conſiderable</hi> heads of this diſcourſe, in the method called for by the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only taken <hi>liberty</hi> to tranſpoſe them, as to <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>laſt)</hi> I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe my ſelfe as yet <hi>unſatisfyed</hi> as to the neceſſity, or <hi>ſuitableneſſe,</hi> of this kind of <hi>defence.</hi> The ſumme of that which I affirmed (which alone gives occaſion to the <hi>defenſative</hi> now under conſideration) is: <hi>that to my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation Grotius in his Annotations had not left above one text of Scripture, if one, giving cleare evidence to the Deity of Chriſt; of his Satisfaction</hi> I <hi>ſaid in ſumme the ſame thing.</hi> Had the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> been pleaſed to have <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced</hi> inſtances of any <hi>evidence</hi> for the diſproovement of my aſſertion, I ſhould very <hi>gladly</hi> and readily have acknoledged my <hi>miſtake</hi> and <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight.</hi> I am <hi>ſtill</hi> alſo in the ſame <hi>reſolution,</hi> as to the <hi>latitude</hi> of the <hi>expre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion,</hi> though I have already by an <hi>induction of particulars,</hi> manifeſted his corrupting and <hi>perverting</hi> of ſo many, both in reſpect of the <hi>one</hi> head, and of the other, with his expreſſe <hi>complyance</hi> with the <hi>Socinians</hi> in his ſo doing, as that I cannot have the leaſt <hi>thought</hi> of letting fall my Charge, which with the <hi>limitation</hi> expreſſed (of <hi>my owne obſervation)</hi> containes the <hi>truth</hi> in this matter, and nothing but that which is ſo.</p>
            <p>It was indeed in my <hi>thoughts</hi> to have done ſomewhat <hi>more</hi> in reference to thoſe <hi>Annotations,</hi> then thus occaſionally to have animadverted on their corruption in generall; namely to have proceeded in the vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>truths</hi> of the Goſpell from their Captivity under the falſe <hi>gloſſes</hi> put upon them, by the interpretations of places of Scripture wherein they are delivered. But this worke being fallen on an <hi>abler hand</hi> viz. that of our <hi>learned profeſſor of Divinity,</hi> my deſire is ſatisfied, and the neceſſity of my indeavour for that end removed.</p>
            <p>There are ſundry other <hi>particulars</hi> inſiſted on by the <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> and a great deale of <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> is layd out about them; which certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not the <hi>Readers</hi> trouble in the peruſall of any other <hi>debate</hi> about them. If they did, it were an eaſie matter to diſcover his <hi>miſtakes</hi> in them all along. The <hi>foundation</hi> of moſt of them, lies in that, which he affirmes Sect. 4. where he ſaies, that <hi>I thus ſtate the Jealouſies about H. G. as farr as it is owned by me,</hi> viz. <hi>that being in doctrine a Socinian, he yet cloſed in many things with the Romane intereſt.</hi> To which he replies, that this does not <hi>ſo much as pretend that he was a Papiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As though I undertake to <hi>prove Grotius</hi> to be a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> or did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely <hi>diſowne</hi> the management of the <hi>Iealouſy,</hi> ſtated as above; or that
