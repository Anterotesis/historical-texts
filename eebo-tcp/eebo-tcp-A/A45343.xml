            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Apoſtle, in the former part of this Chapter, having aſſerted the nature and neceſſity of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Death of Chriſt; he now in my Text, and the preceding Verſe to it, acquaints us with the ends and uſes of it.</p>
            <p>All the Hoſt of Heaven ſtood amazed at this great Myſtery, expecting what would be the iſſue of this great Trial. Men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils could not fathom the depths of God's deſign in this diſmal Tragedy. They verily concluded, That the Captain of our Salvation would now be conquered, and that they ſhould hear no more of him, when once he was hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to his Grave. Can he ſave others, who cannot ſave himſelf? Can he bring life to others, by his own death? After this Sarcaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal manner the <hi>Heathens</hi> upbraided the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:97753:4"/>
and the Apoſtle tells us, That this Death and Croſs of our Lords, was a ſtumbling-block to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and folly to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18, 23. And thus indeed it well might have been, had not that All-wiſe God (who brings light out of darkneſs, and meat out of the eater) by his unſearchable counſel and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom over-ruled this matter ſo, that the Death of Chriſt, like to that of <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s, ſhould iſſue and conclude in the utter rout and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of his, and our greateſt Adverſaries. Whil'ſt they bruiſed his heel, he brake their head. Thus by his wiſe diſpoſal, he made Suffering, to be Saving; Death Victorious, and the Stripes of his Son to be Medicinal and Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us. One end was to deſtroy the power of <hi>Satan,</hi> to <hi>break the head of</hi> that <hi>Serpent, ſtilling this enemy and ſelf-avenger. Pſal.</hi> 8.2. <hi>Leading captivity captive, Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>Bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtrong man,</hi> Matt. 12. <hi>And divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpoil with him,</hi> Iſa. 53. Thus this great deſtroyer was quelled and conquered, and at the Sign of the Croſs thus uſed <hi>(by faith in his death, I mean)</hi> we may at any time put the Devil to flight, and caſt out the Prince of this World.</p>
            <p>The other end is mentioned in my Text, <hi>to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97753:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deliver them who through fear of Death,</hi> &amp;c. Which words acquaint us with a double ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Servants, or <hi>Children</hi> of God, (as they are called in the foregoing Verſe.)</p>

               <item>1. <hi>A ſubjection to Death.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>A ſubjection to Bondage upon account of Death.</hi> From whence I gather theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. God's own Children, thoſe for whom Chriſt dyed, may be brought, and kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fear of Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. The fear of Death is a ſtate of Bondage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. The onely deliverance from this fear, is by the Death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall make the firſt, the ſubject-matter of my Diſcourſe at this time; and in treating on that, ſhall comprehend the other.</p>
            <p>God's own Children, thoſe for whom Chriſt died, may be brought under, nay, kept under the fear of death; and this fear may be ſo great and preſſing, that it may be a heavy burthen; it may gall them much, and deeply affect their Souls to their great diſquietment; ſo that they may have many uneaſie hours, and doleful complaints; it may bring them into an Eſtate of Slavery and <hi>Bondage:</hi> And this trouble may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97753:5"/>
be heavy and great for its nature, but long, and continued for its duration; it may run Parallel with the longeſt date of their time, and not come onely by way of Paroxiſm and Fit, but hold them <hi>all their life long.</hi> So that in the beſt, the fear of Death is not wholly deſtroyed and removed. Grace doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh Nature; and the Chriſtian doth not ceaſe to be Man. There is a double fear of Death.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Natural, and inſeperable from our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition. There is implanted in Man a deſire of Self-preſervation; and this is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures averſation to its own diſſolution. This is an innocent and guiltleſs infirmity, and no more culpable, than wearineſs, ſickneſs, and many other natural imbecillities, inſeperably annexed to the condition of Mortality.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a ſinful fear of Death, a fear of Death more than as it is natural, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is <hi>Poenal,</hi> and an iſſue of the Curſe; as it brings Men under the Devils power, and may prove a dreadful inlet and paſſage to Everlaſting Burnings.</p>
            <p>Now the Children, <hi>(viz.</hi> of God, and of the Promiſe) in ſome meaſure have conquered this laſt ſort of fear; but it is impoſſible for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97753:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them, while they are cloathed with this frail and tattered Humanity, wholly to rid and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt themſelves of the former. Death is the King of Terrors, and therefore may command dread and fear even in the beſt. Plentiful are inſtances of this kind, and they eaſily occur to us. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> feared to die by the hand of his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> and ſtudied how to meet him in Peace, and prayed to God to ſtay his Hand, and turn his Heart. The Man after God's own heart cries, <hi>the ſorrows of death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed him, Pſal.</hi> 116.3. And tells us, how <hi>his ſoul came to be full of trouble, Pſal.</hi> 88.3. becauſe <hi>his life drew nigh to the grave,</hi> and he was <hi>counted with them that go down to the pit.</hi> How induſtrious he was, to ſave his Life, will appear from his Counter-plots to ſave himſelf when <hi>Saul</hi> purſued him. Good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> could not receive a ſummons to the Grave with dry Eyes; the Meſſage made him chatter like a Crane, and mourn as a Dove, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.3, 14. Good old. <hi>Hilarion</hi> was frequently chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his Soul with an <hi>Egredere O Anima,</hi> for being ſo loath to leave a crazy body, in which it had been a Tenant upwards of Fourſcore Years: Nay, our bleſſed Redeemer himſelf, in whom there was no Sin to imbitter his

diſſolution to him, yet we find him greatly affected at the approach of his departure hence; <hi>his ſoul was heavy unto death.</hi> He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred not the Liſts with that laſt Enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a heavy Spirit: <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the ſaying of Reverend Mr. <hi>Greenham,</hi> (page 15. of his Works) <hi>I like as well of them that meaſurably fear death, as of them who joy at it:</hi> In another place he tells us, <hi>He never dared deſire to dye, however his continual Croſſes did afford him ſmall deſire to live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, we ſometimes meet with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Heroes</hi> of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> temper, whoſe ſong ever ſince he had been in the Third Heavens, was to return thither again; who are ſo much exalted above the fear of Death, that they court, and crave it, and make it the moſt deſirable of deſirables, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1 23. They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſing a loath to depart, but chearfully chaunt out with old <hi>Simeon</hi> their <hi>nunc Dimittis,</hi> Luk. 2.29. <hi>Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace.</hi> With <hi>Elijah,</hi> they are ſatisfied, and full enough of days, and crave no further time, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.4. Nay, ſo fervent and earneſt was the deſire of the Primitive Chriſtians after Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Glory, that they groaned earneſtly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97753:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be cloathed upon with their Houſe from Heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. They ſeemed not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be contented, but rejoyced with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; and in the mean time, they did rather accept of Life, than affect it, and endured it, more than deſired it. Great is the number of Chriſtian Pilgrims, who (in St. <hi>Bernards</hi> Phraſe) deſire <hi>Repatriaſſe,</hi> to return home, and looſe from the ſhore of Life, and to Launch out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ocean of Immortality, looking for that bleſſed Hope, and the glorious <hi>Epiphany</hi> of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.13. At the news and tidings of their Lords approach, their Faith Eccho's back their hearty <hi>Amen, Even ſo come Lord Jeſus.</hi> But here we muſt take notice, that our deſires may be looked upon in a double capacity, either as natural and connate, or rational and elicite, according to the Principles of Reaſon and Grace. A man that hath a gangren'd Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber hath a natural deſire to keep it in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but his Rational deſire makes him willing to part with it. Thus our Saviour told the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, He ſhould be bound, and carried whither he would not,</hi> John 21.18. To be gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pinion'd, he would not, according to his Natural will; but according to his Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97753:7"/>
and Sanctified will, he was ready joyfully to go to the place of Martyrdom.</p>
            <p>Thus my Spirit may cry, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus, Come quickly;</hi> when the Fleſh may ſay, <hi>Maſter, ſave thy ſelf,</hi> and pray <hi>that the cup may paſs from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, They who have the greateſt reaſon to dread it, may ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it; and knowing not what it is to dye, bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly ſeem to ſlight it. Thus in theſe low running dregs of time, an Atheiſtical crew of Men living in Brutiſh Ignorance, fall blindfold into their Pit and Grave; they ſhut their Eyes, and are never awakened, till thoſe Infernal Flames flair about them, and lend them Light to read their folly. They are not out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but onely without the knowledge of it: Their hardineſs proceeds not from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their good Eſtate, but their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their bad one, like Paſſengers that are aſleep in a Ship that is ſinking: They Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, and Hector on the very Pits brink, and their joy is like to that of thoſe who are ſtung with the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> which is not the Effect of Mirth, but Madneſs; and though <hi>they have no bands in their Death,</hi> yet <hi>Death hath domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, over them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:97753:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>Pleaſant Company, Wine, Feaſting, Muſick, divert their thoughts from that formidable proſpect of their End, couzening themſelves as far as they can, with that vain Opinion, <hi>That the way to eſcape the ſting of death, is not to think of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is <hi>Riſus Sardonicus,</hi> a deadly joy; <hi>The end of their mirth is heavineſs, Prov.</hi> 14.13. Like thoſe ſilly Fiſhes, which ſwim down the ſweet ſtream of <hi>Jordan,</hi> into the dead Sea, where they periſh.</p>
            <p>Some indeed there are which pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with vain hopes of deliverance, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves with ungrounded preſumptions, that they ſhall eſcape the bitterneſs of Death. Oh the fooliſh, and helpleſs ſhifts that beſotted ſinners cling to! How many periſh at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry horns of the Altar? What ungrounded hopes have they from their own Fictions? How ſadly do they abuſe the beſt Doctrines; and ſuck Poyſon from the extent of God's Mercies, and Chriſt's Merits!

            <p>In further proſecution of this Truth,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. I ſhall lay down ſome Propoſitions that tend to the clearing and confirming of it.</item>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Propoſitions tending to the illuſtration and further defence of this Truth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Prop. <hi>Man in his firſt Creation was not made Mortal or Corruptible. Adam</hi> fell into a dying condition in the day that he Rebelled againſt the Crown and Dignity of Heaven. I know the Queſtion is much controverted, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Adam <hi>were made Immortal, or no?</hi> This were to make Death neceſſary before Sin; which the Apoſtle contradicts, when he writes <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>That by one mans ſin death came into the World:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> Death is the fruit and effect of our Diſobedience, and paſſes upon all, <hi>inaſmuch as all have ſinned, Rom.</hi> 5.12.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:97753:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. Prop. <hi>All men are now ſubject unto death, as it is poenal.</hi> The firſt Sentence reaches all Mankind, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. Moſt men look on Death as the common lot and condition of Mankind, reſulting from their frail condition, and the jarring and warring Principles of their compoſition, which for want of poiſe deſtroy one another. They think it belongs onely to our Natural, and not at all to our Moral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity; reckoning it to be the conſequent of their Being, and not the demerit and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Guilt. It is very true, though the principles of our Nature are ſubject to Diſſolution, yet if we had not declined from the Law of our Creation, we had not inclined to the Grave or Corruption, but God had made our Life commenſurate with our Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and prolonged our Time with our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. But alas! Death now is not more Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, than it is <hi>Poenal.</hi> All Mankind is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as ſoon as Born. Life is a Reprieve, and ſhort ſuſpenſion of the execution of that Sentence, which in the day of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion was pronounced on him, and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants: And oh miſerable we! if we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove not this ſmall ſcantling of time to ſue out our Pardon, and make our peace with this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97753:9"/>
incenſed Judge of Heaven and Earth; who though he be a Serene, yet withal is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Majeſty; and will infallibly Execute the ſeverity of the Sentence on every Offender, who doth not timely accept and comply with thoſe Terms and Articles of Peace, which in the Preaching of his Goſpel are tendred to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Prop. <hi>Fear and Bondage are inſeparable attendants on ſuch a ſinful and poenal ſtate.</hi> It cannot be avoided, but that the expectation of Death in ſuch a condition muſt be very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome. This is a ſtrait Yoak, and will pinch the Necks of all the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Adam,</hi> though ſome wear it more eaſily than others. This will perplex our minds, raiſe ſtorms within, and ſink us frequently into deep deſpondencies; for we know not how to caſt it off, in vain are all attempts to ſlip the Neck out of this Collar; we are unable to deliver ourſelves, no man can free his own Soul. We are in God's Chain, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to break it, all our ſtrivings will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute nothing to its Removal, but onely gall and torment us more.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:97753:9"/>4. Prop. <hi>Whatſover bitterneſs and gall there is in Death, it is from Sin, that makes it more terrible than otherwiſe it would be.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. <hi>The ſting of Death is ſin.</hi> So many Sins as thou committeſt, ſo many ſtings thou putteſt into thy Death, to render it more dreadful to thee. Could a man dye, and have no Sin laid to his Charge, though there might be ſome pain, yet there could not be Terror in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of this World.</p>
            <p>Well may Death be called the Terrible of Terribles, when there is not onely an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the diſſolution and divorce between the Soul and Body, but there interpoſes and ſtarts up the guilt of many Sins, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the Sinner, and ſtare him in the face; nay, thoſe ſins that had a gaudy and tempting dreſs, will then be ſtrip'd of all their feigned Beauties, and appear in all their dreadful Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, agitating and terrifying the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men, with the expectation and dread of future Evils. When the Sinner dare not die, yet cannot live, what Convulſions muſt there needs be in his Breaſt, which muſt terrify him like the cracks of a falling Houſe. What a calm and well-natured Death might a man have, (far beyond that <hi>Euthanaſia</hi> which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97753:10"/>
               <hi>Auguſtus</hi> wiſhed for himſelf) if Sin and Hell, and approaching Judgment, and a gnawing Worm within, did not drive him into Agonies and Deſpair. Alas! when nothing is in view to him but theſe things, and the concluſion of the whole matter will with him be nothing ſhort of hideous Darkneſs, and a tormenting Fire, having Heat but no Light, gnaſhing of Teeth, late Remorſe, incurable Wounds, Self-hatred, and all imaginable diſtreſſes, even to be hated of God, and to hate him for ever, He muſt needs turn away his Face in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of his Soul from beholding ſuch diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Objects. Theſe things our Sins procure for us, and fill our Souls with all the anticipations of Hell.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Prop. <hi>The Death of Chriſt applyed by Faith, is the onely Soveraign Remedy to deliver us out of this eſtate of Fear and Slavery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Heavenly <hi>Eliſha</hi> hath caſt Salt into thoſe bitter Waters, and ſo healed them. Death to a Believer is a Serpent without a ſting. He hath fortified us againſt theſe Fears two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By giving us the example of his Dying.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97753:10"/>
His taſting of Death before hand, keeps it from being a Cup of Trembling, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully will this animate our Spirits under all dejections, That our Lord walked in this dark Valley before us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By affording us the merit and efficacy of his Death;</hi> This is very operative to this purpoſe, to conſider, That our Redeemer, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation, undertook our Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by his own Death: ſo that now there is <hi>no Condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 8.1. For <hi>being juſtified by Faith</hi> in the Death of Chriſt, they have <hi>peace with God,</hi> and in themſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1.</p>
            <p>Thus has Chriſt changed the nature of Death, that it ſhould be more deſirable, than dreadful to a good Man, being like <hi>Joſephs</hi> Chariot ſent for dying <hi>Jacob,</hi> to carry us to the place of our hope and deſire. This made the Apoſtle ring that ſharp and ſhrill Note, in the ears of Death, and ſend that bold and brave Challenge to the laſt eneny; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory?</hi> Death is ſwallowed up in Victory. It is not now ſo much an Outlet of Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97753:11"/>
as an Inlet of Eternal Life. Well might the Apoſtle write inſultingly, as a man offering Sacrifice for Victory, and ſinging a Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Song, while his Feet ſtood on the Neck of his Enemy. We know now to whom to have Recourſe, when our Spirits droop at the apprehenſion of our Deceaſe; not to Saints, or Angels, not to the Bleſſed Virgin her ſelf; but to her Son, who is the Lord of Life: that Brazen Serpent we are to look upon, when that Fiery one of Death puts out his Sting; and we are ſufficiently Antidoted againſt all the Poyſon that is ſpit at us.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the <hi>Children,</hi> though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape the ſtroak, yet they are freed from the ſting of Death; they can play upon the hole of this Aſpe without danger, and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the grimmeſt approach of this Deſtroyer with a ſmile, being freed from the Venom of this Serpent, by him who is, the <hi>Captain of the Lords Hoſts;</hi> who hath aboliſhed Death, and brought <hi>Life and Immortality to light.</hi> He has by his own Death, made Death to them, not onely tollerable and eaſie, but deſirable and gladſome. Indeed, none dared cope with this King of Terrors, but our <hi>Bleſſed Lord;</hi> and he by dying, went into the Den of this
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97753:11"/>
Dragon, Fought it, and Conquered it in its own Territories and Dominions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Prop. <hi>Notwithſtanding all that Chriſt hath done to reconcile us to a view and proſpect of our Diſſolution; yet ſo deep is the love of Life, and fear of Death implanted in us all, that Nature cannot but tremble at the approaches of it.</hi> Though this Serpent is bereaved of his Sting, and the Nature of it changed to every holy man; yet its hiſſing affects us at ſometimes with a cold ſweat and ſhivering, ſome regrets and averſation from it. The heart of that man who is moſt heavenly, and covetous of entring the promiſed new <hi>Canaan,</hi> who breathes after that happy Country, the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> above, is now and then ſtartled at his paſſage thorough the howling Deſert which leads thither; he would be cloathed with Immortality, and yet unwilling to put off the Garment of this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. We would be bleſſed and happy, but wiſh it might be ſome other way than by dying. Loath weare to be <hi>abſent</hi> from the Lord, and yet deſirous to be <hi>preſent</hi> here; we may deſire to be with the Lord, and yet at ſometimes very loath to depart: it is often the caſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a Child of God, that he very willingly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97753:12"/>
would be at his journeys end, and yet at the ſame time dreads the going <hi>the way of all fleſh,</hi> which leads to it: thus, like little Children, we are covetous of being cloathed with a new Garment, and yet may be ſo pained and pinched in the putting of it on, that it may force a Tear or two to diſtil from our Eyes, in the exchange of our Sute of Fleſh, for the Robes of Glory.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Prop. <hi>This natural fear of Death frequently ſinks and degenerates into a very vitious and ſinful one.</hi> It is difficult in this matter, ſo to fear, as not to over-fear. Our Paſſions of this nature, are often ſubject, either to miſtake their <hi>Object</hi> by fearing what we need not, or elſe to exceed their <hi>bounds</hi> by fearing more than we need, or ought. Hence it often comes to paſs, That this dread of Death has proved a great ſnare to the beſt Men. What mean and unmanly ſhifts, what poor tricks and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, what unfriendly ways and methods have many uſed, (even to the ſpilling of others Blood) to ſave their own? They have ſullied their Names and Reputations, wounded their own Spirits, and grieved thoſe of their Friends, and all to eke out an Inch of Life. <hi>Abraham</hi> though dignified with that Illuſtrious Title,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97753:12"/>
of the <hi>Father of the faithful;</hi> yet ſo unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving was he of God's Providence over him, that he betakes himſelf to ſinful Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (thoſe Couſin-germains to a Lye) to ſave his Life. While we uſe any indirect means to prolong our days, it plainly Reproaches us to our faces, that we fear men more than God, and Death more than Hell and Damnation; which is very abſurd and fooliſh, to fear the leſs, and not the greater evil; to be afraid to <hi>dye,</hi> but not to be <hi>Damned.</hi> Great reaſon therefore there is, to watch over this Natural Fear, leſt it prove immoderate, and betray us into the hands of many foul Temptations, as it did <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> Our Saviour gives us praemonitions about it, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us not to be <hi>afraid of men who can kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do: but I will forewarn you whom you ſhall fear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4, 5. One fear, (like fire) drives out another. If the fear of God more prevailed in our hearts, it would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully qualifie and moderate all the powers of our Souls, that there would not be ſuch prevailing exceſſes and diſorders in them. Our care therefore muſt be, that our Natural Fear be compatible with that which is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97753:13"/>
and that we never dread any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it is conſiſtent with the fear of God.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Prop. <hi>This Natural fear of Death being kept within due bounds, may very much be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to our advantage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It will help us to be more patient under<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der</hi> all <hi>poenal evils.</hi> So Sentence of Death be not executed, Stripes and Impriſonment, Fines and Baniſhment are more eaſily under-gone. <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath he will give for his life, Job</hi> 2.4. A <hi>living</hi> man will not <hi>complain, Lam.</hi> 3.39. Thou art <hi>alive</hi> man, that one word encircles many Bleſſings, and I pronounce an hundred Good things in that comprehenſive Monoſyllable. Of all other evils we ſay, They are not ſo bad as Death, and therefore they may, and muſt be bore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It will make us more watchful againſt all ſinful evils.</hi> God has in his Law appointed Death, as a puniſhment for many Offences, that it might be a curb and bridle in our Mouths to reſtrain us from the Commiſſion of thoſe Sins; and when men throw this aſide, what wickedneſs is there which they will not attempt?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:97753:13"/>
               <hi>Eve</hi> was emboldned to ſin by the Devils telling her, <hi>ſhe ſhall not die.</hi> Men will not commit that wickedneſs which they know is not onely againſt <hi>God,</hi> but againſt their own <hi>lives</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>It will weaken our pride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It will render us more low and vile in our own Eyes.</hi> This will much abate our Pride, and keep us humble. <hi>Put them in fear, O God, (viz.</hi> of Death) <hi>that they may know themſelves to be but men, Pſal.</hi> 9.20.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It will ſtrengthen our Faith. We recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God which raiſeth the Dead.</hi> While a man looks to ſenſe, and is upheld by ſenſible Comforts, there is not that exerciſe for Faith, which otherwiſe there would be; for the exerciſe therefore, and ſtrengthning of his Grace ſo acceptable to God, and advantageous to us, God expoſes his <hi>Children</hi> to this fear of Death, that when all other helps and ſupports are removed, they may fly to him for Refuge. The <hi>Bohemians</hi> when they loſt their famous Captain <hi>Ziſca,</hi> ſtiled themſelves <hi>Orphans: She that is a wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow indeed, and deſolate, truſteth in God,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.5. Whereas, while ſhe had an Husband and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97753:14"/>
Children, ſhe truſted over-much in them. The <hi>Hemorrhoiſſe</hi> made not her Applications to our Lord, till all her ſtock was ſpent. <hi>A poor and afflicted people will truſt in the name of the Lord,</hi> Zeph. 3.12.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It will quicken our preparations for death.</hi> God therefore wills it, That we ſhould have, not onely ſome <hi>thoughts,</hi> but alſo ſome <hi>fears</hi> of Death; that we may improve the day of Grace, and be working while it is called to day. Fear is an Affection which quickens to Action; <hi>Noah</hi> being <hi>moved with fear, prepared an Ark,</hi> Heb. 11.7. They that fear not Death, grow deſperate, their Language is, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die;</hi> but they that are armed with this well-guided and bounded fear, infer much more wiſely, ſaying, <hi>Let us pray, read, hear, repent, believe, obey, for to morrow we die.</hi> Thus you ſee great advantages may be made of this Natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and we may learn how to turn our Water into Wine; to make thoſe thoughts of Death, which at ſome times lie very cold at our Stomachs, to become very cordial and reviving againſt all ſinful and immoderate dread of it. Grace, though it do not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, yet it corrects and regulates Nature;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97753:14"/>
and by the ways above mentioned, mortifies this fear, that it prove not a Temptation to Sin. <hi>Stoiciſm</hi> hath attempted to do this; but Chriſtianity onely can, and hath effected it; In the School of Chriſt is beſt taught the right Cure of all our amazing and diſtracting fears.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I come now to inquire into the grounds and cauſes of this fear. As before I diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this fear it ſelf, ſo now I ſhall the cauſes of it, into Natural, and Sinful.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Natural Cauſes.</hi> Death on this account is dreadful, becauſe it is a future, unavoidable evil to Nature. As a <hi>future poſſible good</hi> is the <hi>object of hope,</hi> ſo a <hi>future poſſible evil</hi> is the <hi>object of fear;</hi> and much more it is to be dreaded, when it is a <hi>certain</hi> futurity, <hi>as death is,</hi> which no ways can be declined. Nature looks upon Death as its Enemy, whoſe deſign is to divorce and ſeparate Soul and Body, two ancient Comerades, no wonder therefore that it ſhun it, when it knows it ſhall one day fall by the hand of it. Memorable is the paſſage of that Martyr to the Executioner, driving the Staple into the Stake; <hi>Pray friend knock it in faſt, for Nature will be working.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that this fear is greater in ſome, than
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97753:15"/>
others, from the very conſtitution and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the Body, is every days obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Our very natural Complexion renders us either more bold, or fearful. This is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Paſſion, which though it may be Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Sanctified, yet it cannot be totally Conquered, for Religion changes not the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the Body. Good men who are of this fearful temper, and melancholy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and experience the <hi>tyranny</hi> of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Paſſion, have need to pray for the <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of it. <hi>I never thought Religion did depend upon the temper of the Body, but I am ſure the acting and exerting of it very much doth.</hi> But theſe fears, ſo far as they are Natural, they are Lawful; for they are not Tranſgreſſions of any precept, and though they may be reckoned amongſt our <hi>infelicities</hi> and <hi>weakneſſes,</hi> yet they come not into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Crimes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There are <hi>ſinful grounds</hi> of this fear of Death; theſe chiefly are to be regarded, and they are very many; ſome I ſhall name, and can do little more than in the groſs produce them, leaving you to enlarge on them, and I am ſure any <hi>man of thoughts</hi> may be very Copious on this Subject; his own inward
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97753:15"/>
ſenſe of things ſtrongly will atteſt all to him. This <hi>ſinful</hi> fear proceeds,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the want of a <hi>holy</hi> fear, the fear of the Great God. As the fear of him is the leſs, the fear of God in our Lives, is the ready way to caſt us into a ſlaviſh fear of Death. It was one of the Judgments Threatned, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.58, 65, 66. <hi>If thou wilt not obſerve to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name,</hi> THE LORD THY GOD; <hi>Then neither ſhall the ſole of thy foot have rest, but the Lord ſhall give thee a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and ſorrow of mind; and thy life ſhall hang in doubt before thee, and thou ſhalt</hi> fear <hi>day and night, and ſhalt have no aſſurance of thy life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From the <hi>want of faith in the death of Christ</hi> ſprings this <hi>fear of our own death.</hi> Even <hi>the children,</hi> holy and religious perſons, who live ſoberly, righteouſly, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are ſometimes beſet with theſe uncomfortable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Death; being now and then plagued with the remainders of an unbelieving heart, as if ſtill Death were not ſubdued, as if Death had conquered Chriſt, and not Chriſt Death: The Diſciples <hi>were terrified and frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and unbelieving thoughts did ariſe in their hearts,</hi> Luk. 24.37, 38. <hi>Fools,</hi> our Lord calls them, <hi>and ſlow of heart to believe,</hi> ver. 25. <hi>We truſted that it had been he which would have redeemed Iſrael,</hi> v. 21. Here their Faith flag'd, and hang'd, the wing extreamly; their Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler was much battered, and ſtood in need of beating out again. <hi>Weakneſs of Faith</hi> gives <hi>ſtrength</hi> to our Fears, and doth both <hi>greaten</hi> and <hi>multiply</hi> them upon us. Faith is not without its Conflict with ſadneſs of Spirit, and carnal fears; <hi>Amalek</hi> ſometimes is too hard for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Houſe, of <hi>Saul</hi> frequently prevails over the Houſe of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:97753:16"/>3. This Fear proceeds from want of ſerious <hi>meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> on Death, and due <hi>preparation</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>Our negligence and ſloath in not finiſhing that Work which God has put into our hands to do, way well make us loath to come to an account with our Lord. Bad Stewards are afraid of a Reckoning; and Death coming thus ſuddenly, puts all into Confuſion: <hi>Suddenneſs and fear</hi> are joyned together, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.25. Suddenneſs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is the deſcription of a doleful and fearful Eſtate. When men have laid in no Antidotes and Cordials againſt Death, then, like <hi>Nabal,</hi> their Hearts die before they do. This was <hi>Davids</hi> Caſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. <hi>ult. O ſpare me.</hi> Stay a little, that <hi>I may get ſtrength</hi> to combat with this Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. The beſt are too backward in their preparations for this Encounter with this grim and gaſtly Enemy, and therefore are not without their fears; But oh! who can expreſs that great fearfulneſs which needs muſt ſurpriſe Unregenerate men, who are clapping many Stings into their Deaths by their repeated and continued Sins; they take pains to make their End uneaſie, and with their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces dreſs up Death in a terrible Vizard to affright them. What eaſe can they live at, whoſe Souls this Night may be turned out of their ſoft Beds where now they lye ſecurely ſnorting, into a Bed of Flames? one would think, theſe Men ſhould eat their Bread with trembling, and the thoughts of their danger ſhould keep them waking. There is no wonder, that a ſinful <hi>Cauſe</hi> ſhould produce a ſinful <hi>Effect;</hi> and that Mens <hi>Terrors</hi> ſhould be increaſed with their <hi>Offences.</hi> Every wicked man muſt look Death in the face, with pale cheeks. It was a Copy of <hi>Julians</hi> countenance, but not of his <hi>dying one,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Vitam repeſcenti naturae tanquam debitor bonae fidei redditurus exulto.</hi> What <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane mens merry living, That <hi>even in laughing their heart is ſorrowful,</hi> Prov. 14.13. is very applicable to their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97753:16"/>
Dying condition, their heart gives their mouth the Lye.</p>
            <p>Indeed, ſometimes like furious Gameſters, they throw up their Cards, not out of any diſlike of gaming, but of their Games; they are rather diſcontented with Life, than contented with Death; but yet ſuch reaſſume their Play, and go on afreſh; and ſo do theſe Paſſionate Fools upon ſecond thoughts, eat their words, and unwiſh their wiſhes. Such are like to <hi>Gaal</hi> in his drink, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.27. <hi>He curſed Abimileeh</hi> when he was at a great diſtance; ſpeaks very contemptibly of him, brags how he would uſe him, if he had him in his Clutches, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Abimelechs</hi> appearance, his courage was cooled, his heart ſunk into his heels, for he fled before him, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. Mens ſins will one time or other ſink their ſpirits, and make their Death dreadful; and that upon account,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Of the guilt that is in ſin.</hi> To apprehend ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned, amazes and confounds, and therefore God's Arreſt by Death, muſt make the knees ſmite, and ſtrike one againſt another, <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> like, who could not hold his joynts ſtill.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Of the filth in ſin.</hi> The defilement of it is ſo great, that it makes the ſinner ſtartle. Such ſqualid and naſty ſights, muſt needs occaſion the turning away of our Eyes. Who can look upon them, and live? The Sinner often ſinks and drops at the view of his Luſts; they have a kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Aſpect.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Exceſſive love of Life, and of this World, begets immoderate fear of Death. When Mens hearts are ſo cloſely united to Creature-comforts, they cannot be torn from them without much violence and pain. What we over love in the Enjoyment, we over-fear in the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of its loſs. A Child that has taſted much of the Breaſt, cannot be pulled from it without much crying: Things glued together, are ſeldom parted, without tearing or breaking. If thy Portion is onely in this Life, thou
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97753:17"/>
art utterly undone when it is ended, and who can blame a man for fearing the loſs of his <hi>All?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a <hi>Canonical</hi> Truth, though in the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <hi>O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that liveth at reſt in his poſſeſſions! Eccleſ.</hi> 40.1. How ſad a ſight is a Hand writing on the Wall to a <hi>Belſhaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> in his Cups? To a rich man dreaming of his <hi>goods laid up for many years,</hi> how ſad and confounding muſt that voice be, <hi>Thou fool, this night thy ſoul ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thee?</hi> Luk. 12.20. It was a wiſe and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Speech of <hi>Charles the Fifth,</hi> to the <hi>Duke of Venice,</hi> who <hi>Hezekiah</hi>-like, ſhewed him the Glories of his Throne and Palace, his great Wealth and Riches; <hi>Haec ſunt quae faciunt invitos mori,</hi> Theſe are the things that make us loath to Dye.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This fear is frequently occaſioned by too much <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs</hi> about our worldly Affairs; I mean, the neglect of a provident, timely ſetting our Houſe in order, and adjourning this neceſſary and hard Work to the dregs of our Age. That which ſhould be the <hi>living</hi> Mans care, is too often the <hi>dying</hi> Man's task: The ending of our Accounts with Men, and the beginning of our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts with God, are both of them generally put off to the inconvenient ſeaſon of a Death-bed! To reckon with God and Man at once, is too hard a Province for a ſick and languiſhing ſinner. Many more Grounds might be aſſigned, I ſhall add but one more.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The breach of former ſick-bed Vows and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, when we were in fear of Death, renders men more fearful when once they come in ſight of it.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer is not amiſs which <hi>Theodoricus, Biſhop of Coleine</hi> gave to the Emperor <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> upon his inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which way he might beſt get to Heaven: <hi>If thou walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> (ſaid the Biſhop) <hi>ſo as thou didst promiſe under thy
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97753:17"/>
painful fit of the Stone.</hi> Our Extremity commonly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us holy, and our Pain is prodigal of thoſe Vows, which our eaſe is niggardly of performing. We daily ſee deſperation making thoſe <hi>Votaries,</hi> who in their health were the looſeſt <hi>Libertines.</hi> Were it eſſential to Health, thus to debauch us, it would make a good man out of love with it. It were better to be always Sick, than for our Health to maks us Irreligious. Let us pray to God to remedy this Sickneſs of our Health and to bleſs us rather with ſanctified afflictions, than <hi>curſe</hi> us with unſanctified proſperity.</p>
            <p>I now am to ſpeak to the third Particular, and that by way of Uſe and Application.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To give ſome Preſcriptions and Remedies, by way of Antidote and Defence againſt the Fears of Death.</hi> It was one of the defects which the Learned <hi>Verulam, (In his advancement of Learning,)</hi> found in our Phyſitians, that they do not ſtudy thoſe Rmedies, which might procure an <hi>Euthanaſy,</hi> an eaſie paſſage to their Patients (ſince they muſt needs dye) thorough the Gates of Death. Such helps muſt be left <hi>(ſaith Biſhop</hi> Hall) to the care of the skilful Sages of Nature, the uſe whereof muſt be with great caution; leſt while they endeavour to ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Death, they ſhorten Life. My work at preſent, is to preſcribe ſpiritual helps to an eaſie and comfortable departure out of the houling Wilderneſs of this World, to make the Grave-bed ſoft, that we may lye down in Peace there, and deſcend to thoſe dark Chambers with as great deſire, as a weary Traveller lies down to Sleep. The neglect of looking to this while we live, is the cauſe why Death comes on ſo many as a <hi>Snare,</hi> as amongſt many other, it did on <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> (the wicked Son of a worſe Father, <hi>viz.</hi> Pope <hi>Alexander the ſixth)</hi> who meeting Death in that Cup of Poyſon, which he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for others, cried out with great Conſternation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97753:18"/>
this terrible Surpriſe. <hi>Adverſus omnia pericula me munivi praeter quam mortem:</hi> That he had armed himſelf againſt all caſualties, excepting Death, for of that he never thought. Amazing and deplorable inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! that men ſhould find time to think of all things, but thoſe which do moſt nearly concern them! that <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> and <hi>Hell, Death</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> ſhould then only come into mens thoughts, when they have nothing elſe to think of. How ſolicitous are we to fortifie our ſelves againſt external evils, timely engaging againſt Sickneſs and Poverty, Baniſhment and Impriſonment, Cold and Hunger, Shame and Scandal, but laying little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing up againſt the evil day? Death comes and ſeizes moſt with a heavy hand, becauſe ſo little is done to bear up againſt it. Take notice here of the excellency of the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> which affords beyond all other <hi>Profeſſions,</hi> the greateſt relief in this way. Some Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have eſſayed upon comforts of this Nature; and <hi>Epicurus</hi> tells us, if a wiſe man were to burn in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi> Bull, he might ſay, <hi>Dulcae eſt, &amp; ad me nihil pertinet.</hi> But theſe were empty brags, and founded on ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, of which we may ſay, (as <hi>Job</hi> to his Friends) <hi>Ye are miſerable comforters;</hi> ſuch as theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Premeditation on it before it comes; others reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted this as much, becauſe it made a man miſerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ſo. Meer apprehenſions of it to them (whow wamed the <hi>Divine Oracles)</hi> ſignified little to lighten their burden.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others ſupported themſelves with the thoughts of neceſſity, and inevitable fate, and many ſuch like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. But alas, tho <hi>Philoſophy</hi> has been ſtiled <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi medicina;</hi> yet their Precepts in reference to comfort, have been compared to the influence of the Moon, which doth rather rotten, then ripen, in reſpect of the Suns influence. They were ignorant of <hi>Chriſt the Prince of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97753:18"/>
Peace,</hi> of the holy <hi>Paraclete and Comforter,</hi> and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>Life of Faith.</hi> They knew not how with <hi>Ignatius,</hi> to invite the <hi>Croſs and Fire, Breaking on the Rack, Quartering of Members,</hi> and all the <hi>Torments</hi> that either Men or Devils could invent. When the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror threatned St. <hi>Baſil</hi> with Death, <hi>O that it might come,</hi> was his ready and chearful reply. When <hi>Eudoxa</hi> the Empreſs threatned <hi>Chryſoſtome;</hi> he ſent her word, <hi>Nihil praeter peccatum timeo:</hi> he feared Gods wrath, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Sins) but not at all her. Theſe are the men that tread on the <hi>Lion,</hi> the <hi>Aſp,</hi> and the <hi>Adder.</hi> And that we may be enabled to do the like, take theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Directions; theſe comforts and conſolations of Gods own Preſcription in the Holy Scriptures, which as far exceed all Philoſophical Remedies, as the Sun doth a Glow-worm. I am conſtrained to be ſhort in them, and muſt leave it to you, to blow every bloſſom into a Flower.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Direct. <hi>Rectify your Apprehenſions and Opinions of Death.</hi> Is not thy fear of it grounded upon a miſtake? Fears are apt to agravate evils.<note place="margin">Mors nomen tantum fidelibus. vitae via Bern. Omnibus finis, multis remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, non nullis votum.</note> 
               <hi>Levis eſt dolor ſi nihil opinio adjecerit.</hi> We fright our ſelves with Images and Idaeas of evils, and dreſs up Bug bears and Mormoes to Torment our ſelves withal. Chriſt himſelf walking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Waters, was by the Diſciples trembled at as a dreadful Apparition. It may be thou lookeſt on Death, as ſome utter <hi>Abolition</hi> and <hi>Extinction</hi> of thy Being. Remember it is but a <hi>departing,</hi> which thou calleſt a <hi>Death.</hi> See how God himſelf ſtiles it to the <hi>Father of the faithful,</hi> Gen. 15.15. <hi>Thou ſhalt go thy fathers in peace.</hi> It is but a <hi>going away,</hi> not a <hi>periſhing;</hi> and not a going to wo and miſery, but a comfortable going to our Fathers. It is hence called, <hi>the way of all the earth,</hi> Joſh. 23.14. Chriſt intimates his Death under this Notion; <hi>It is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for you that I go away,</hi> John 16.7. Death is a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97753:19"/>
               <hi>journeying</hi> from one Region to another. See in what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar terms God conferred with <hi>Moſes</hi> about his Death, Deut. 32.49, 50. <hi>Get thee up into this mountain, and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people.</hi> Death it ſelf is ſo embalmed and cloathed in the Holy Scriptures, that there is even a ſweetneſs and beauty in it: therefore called an <hi>uncloathing,</hi> a <hi>putting off the fleſh.</hi> He that has wore his Cloathes long, till they are foul and naſty, will he not willingly ſtrip him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to put on a freſh Suit?</p>
            <p>Children fear their neareſt Relations, and beſt Friends, when they appear under a diſguiſe to them; but when their Vizard is taken off, they rejoice at their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>To ſweeten our <hi>departure</hi> to us, it is called a <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>ſleep.</hi> Is there any hurt in that? Would not a man tired out with a long days work, gladly go to bed? Under theſe Notions we may bury all fearful thoughts of Death. <hi>Our friend Lazarus ſleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of ſleep,</hi> John 11.11. What more deſirable and refreſhing than a good nights reſt? Sleep is the Nurſe of Nature, the ſweet <hi>Parentheſis</hi> of all our Griefs and Cares. Cloathe thy Death therefore in a Scripture dreſs, and this will help to allay the bitterneſs, and beautifie the deformity of it. Sleep is a <hi>ſhort Death,</hi> and Death is but a <hi>long Sleep.</hi> The <hi>Babylonians</hi> are threatned with death, under the name of a <hi>long ſleep,</hi> Jer. 51.57. <hi>They ſhall ſleep a perpetual ſleep, and not wake, ſaith the King whoſe name is the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> It is a <hi>Judgment</hi> to be caſt into a ſleep like death, but a <hi>Mercy</hi> that Death is like a ſleep: Nay, death is not a <hi>perpetual ſleep:</hi> A good man when he has done his work, falls aſleep, and awakes in the great morning of the Reſurrection to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his wages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:97753:19"/>Hence the Grave is call'd a <hi>Bed,</hi> Iſa. 57.2. It is Gods <hi>Ark</hi> and <hi>Cheſt,</hi> wherein he keeps the Bodies of his Saints, and he will open this <hi>Cabinet</hi> in the great day of the Reſurrection, and take his <hi>Jewels</hi> out; he will ſcowre and furbiſh them up again, making their <hi>vile</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies like unto the <hi>glorious</hi> body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> call the Grave, <hi>Beth Chaiim,</hi> i. e. <hi>The houſe of the living;</hi> and when they return from the Burial of their Friends, they pluck up the graſs, and caſt it into the Air, uſing thoſe words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 72.16. <hi>They ſhall flouriſh like the graſs of the earth.</hi>

Thou art not ſo ſure to ariſe in the Morning, when thou lieſt down at Night, as thou art to awake at that day. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. <hi>For if we believe that Jeſus died, and roſe again, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi> What an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote is this againſt the worſt of Death? That Chriſt who did ariſe from the Dead, ſhall come again, and bring all his with him in Glory? Theſe <hi>Scripture</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations come home to the very heart, which the <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical</hi> ones did not, (being in <hi>Tullies</hi> Phraſe, <hi>Medicine morbo imbecilliores;)</hi> well therefore might the Apoſtle

            </p>
            <p>The Courage and Conſtancy of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Martyrs was ſuch on this account, that they would not accept of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance in their Tortures, that they might <hi>obtain a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reſurrection,</hi> Heb. 11.35.

            </p>

How many have deſired Death, nay ſinfullly deſtroyed their Lives, to deliver themſelves from Griefs, Fears, Wants and Pains? 'Tis true, he Sins highly that goes away out of this World, before God calls him; yet who would refuſe to go, when once he is call'd?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It will put thee into poſſeſſion of thine Inheritance.</hi> I deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt. Who would tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo long from his dear Lord, that might have paſſage to him? When the <hi>Heathen Socrates</hi> was to dye for his

Religion, he was greatly comforted at his Death, with this, that he ſhould go to the place where he ſhould meet <hi>Orphous, Homer, Heſiod,</hi> and many other Worthies of the former Ages: Had he but known <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Cherubim</hi> and <hi>Seraphim, Angels,</hi> glorified <hi>Saints, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apoſtles, Martyrs, Confeſſors,</hi> our Fathers, Mothers, near Relations, and dear Friends, and the reſt of the glorious Heirarchy of Heaven, he would then doubtleſs have taken down his deadly draught of Hemlock with greater reliſh and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proto-Martyr Stephen</hi> triumphed over Death, when he ſaw the Heavens opened, and the Son of man ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Gods right hand.

left behind, and then which part do you deſire to be with? But eſpecially remember that <hi>Jeſus</hi> your head is entred into the Heavens before you, and is preparing a place for you, not being willing to be there without your company. He would have you there to behold his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and do not theſe conſiderations provoke you to covet to be united to that heavenly Quire above, which inceſſantly Sing (not reſting either day or night) that melodious Anthem to him that ſits on the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever, of bleſſing and honour, and glory, and power, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.13. Many more things might be added by way of Direction, but I ſhall add but this one more, tho the moſt conſiderable and important.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Direct. <hi>Act faith on the death of Christ:</hi> Here is the main prop and pillar of comfort. Who would have dared to dye, had not our Lord dyed firſt? he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, the Sting of Death; what harm can there be in a ſtingleſs Snake? He hath cut the lock of Sin, where the ſtrength of Death lay. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.14. <hi>O Death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction:</hi> Chriſt hath happily triumphed over it, both for himſelf and thee; his precious Blood has altered its Complexion, and turn'd its pale Face into a beautiful Sanguine: Our Redeemer having unſtung it, we may ſafely put it into our Boſomes; It is an Enemy indeed, but a Conquered and diſarm'd one. Doſt dread an Enemy Vanquiſh'd to thy hand, and ſprawling at thy feet? Hath <hi>David</hi> killed this great and formidable <hi>Goliah,</hi> and ſhall not trembling <hi>Iſrael</hi> reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Spirits, and up, and purſue the <hi>Philistines?</hi> Shall a Conquered Enemy diſanimate the Conquerors? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and revive, O Chriſtian; The Captain of thy Salvation has not onely deſtroyed, but ſanctified the Grave to thee, and perfumed the duſt thereof with his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97753:22"/>
own body. What comfortable words are thoſe, <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo, John</hi> 14.19. The Grave that otherwiſe affords but a noyſom ſmell, ſmells ſweet ever ſince the <hi>Roſe of Sharon,</hi> and the <hi>Lily</hi> of the Vallies lay in it. This dark hole is made lightſome, ever ſince that <hi>true Light,</hi> (for a time Eclipſed) ſhone out of it. Thus our <hi>Sampſon</hi> has found an honey-comb in the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe of this Lion. Chriſt is the Lion of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> from whoſe Death, as from a plentiful Breaſt, we may ſuck abundance of ſweetneſs. His Sepulchre is the moſt fragrant knot in <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Garden: your thoughts cannot be dyed into a richer Colour than the meditation of Chriſt Crucified. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> always did bare about in his Body, ſo do you in your Minds, the dying of the Bleſſed Jeſus: Aſſure your ſelves, the pale face of Death will look ruddy, when you caſt this blood of ſprinkling on it.</p>
            <p>This ſhould arm the Heirs of Life, againſt the fear of Death. We read Cant. 3.7, 8. <hi>The valiant of Iſrael have their ſwords on their thighs becauſe of fear in the night.</hi> Night ſtrikes men into fears; eſpecially, the Night of Death; but gird this Sword on thy Thigh, get a living Faith in thy Heart, and all the fears of Death will not dead it.</p>
            <p>This ſhould teach us to give Praiſe and Thanks to our Lord and Maſter. How did the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> rejoyce, when they had got <hi>Sampſon</hi> in their hands? <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.23, 24. <hi>Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together, for to offer a great ſacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoyce: for they ſaid, Our god hath delivered Sampſon our enemy into our hand. And when the people ſaw him, they praiſed their god: for they ſaid, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the deſtroyer of our country, which ſlew many of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>Lebanon</hi> is ſufficient to burn? Or what Cattel
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97753:22"/>
on a Thouſand Hills for a Sacrifice? What <hi>Hecatombs</hi> of Praiſe and Service are due to our <hi>great God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour?</hi> Who hath delivered the Deſtroyer both of our Souls and Bodies into our hands; and us out of his; who hath ſlain, not onely many of us, but either hath, or will make havock of us all, heaps upon heaps, and that far more and greater than ever <hi>Sampſon</hi> did of the <hi>Philiſtines. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to our most mighty and merciful God and Saviour be all the praiſe and glory given, who hath tranſlated us from under the power of ſin and death, into the kingdom of his dear Son.</hi>

            <p>HAving finiſhed one <hi>Text,</hi> it may be expected I ſhould ſpeak on <hi>another,</hi> viz. <hi>Our deceaſed Brother,</hi> who is the doleful occaſion of this days ſolemnity I acknowledg I have not been much uſed to <hi>Funeral Encomiaſticks;</hi> and when I conſider that this kind of Work is not without much hazard, I do the more unwillingly engage in it. Relations will think <hi>too little</hi> is ſpoke, others <hi>too much.</hi> The taſk is hard, when on one hand I may be cenſured to give a faint and mean Character, and on the other hand I may be thought to over do it, and be Paraſitical. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg it (and ſhall endeavour to avoid it) That it is too common on theſe occaſions to <hi>Saint</hi> all at their Death, who expreſſed little of <hi>ſanctity</hi> in their lives. It was ſaid of <hi>Julian, Idoneus erat dicere Panegyricum dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolo.</hi> He was fit to <hi>Canonize</hi> the Devil; and I have read that <hi>Bruno</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> did it. This ſhould make us wary in Diſcourſes of this Nature: But where there is real worth, and deeds praiſe-worthy are to be found, to deny the ſcattering a few flowers on the Hearſe of ſuch a Perſon, would be injuſtice both to the living and the dead. There is a generation of men, whoſe eyes are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97753:23"/>
moſtly fixed on the dark ſides and blemiſhes of their Brethren, and chuſe to repreſent them to be ſuch always, as poſſibly they once might find them to be in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtance of their lives. Concerning ſuch, I ſhall ſay no more, than that there are in the world ſuch things to be found, as Envy, Pride, Detraction, evil Surmiſing, Malice, and Rancour, which like ſmoak is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways driven upon the faireſt Faces. I am not ſo partial as to believe <hi>our deceaſed Brother</hi> to have lived without his <hi>Humanities</hi> and <hi>Frailties</hi> (let ſuch who have eſcaped them, throw Stones at him); yet God kept him from the immoralities and groſs pollutions of the times and places wherein he lived. Good and wiſe men have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally determined, That <hi>it is more pardonable to praiſe a worthy perſon, even beyond his merits, than to be always rakeing with the nail in the ſores of others, who may juſtly deſerve our reproof and correction.</hi> They are two equal guilts, <hi>to detract from an enemy; and to laviſh and be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal in the commendation of a Friend</hi> I hope there is no one here that ſcruples the commending of the dead, tho our Age abounds with many of that humour, who little ſcruple the calumniating both dead and living. I am in a ſtreight betwixt two, having much to object both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſpeaking, and being ſilent: yet I muſt not deny our Brother the <hi>Juſta defunctorum,</hi> the rights and dues of the dead; I ſhall ſay but little, and that (as near as may be) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of my own Knowledg and Obſervation. Sorry I am, to be an Actor in this mournful Scene; it might better become, and better be done by ſome other; but providence has made it my task to perform this laſt Office of love.</p>
            <p>We are met to ſolemnize the Funerals of ROBERT H<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTINGTON <abbr>Eſq</abbr>, a Gentleman as generally beloved as known, who lived much deſired, and dies much lamented. My buſineſs is not to tell you, he deſcended
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:97753:23"/>
from an ancient and worthy Family, that is the work of the <hi>Herald,</hi> not of the <hi>Preacher,</hi> and thoſe Eſcutcheons on his Hearſe ſufficiently tell that; my task is to blazon a more noble Coat, and to give you thoſe good grounds of hope which we have of his new and better Birth, which are theſe following.</p>
            <p>He was not only a <hi>Frequent,</hi> but a <hi>Reverent</hi> hearer of Gods Word, not eaſily detained from the publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as we ſadly obſerve in this profane Age many are, who queſtion the Gentility of that man, who goes to Church more than once on Gods day, reckoning him the beſt bred, and moſt modiſh, who is for three Meals a day in his own houſe, and either none, or but one at moſt in Gods. O ſad and deplorable Age we live in! that by how much the leſſer any man lives like a Chriſtian, to be reckoned ſo much the better Gentleman! If this be the Character of one well bred, and well born, I am ſure our Brother muſt not have it, for he with his, went to the Habitation of Gods <hi>Holineſs, and the place where Gods honour dwelleth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was an <hi>Honourer and Encourager</hi> of a Religious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; I have often heard him ſpeak of ſuch who were diligent and faithful in that ſacred Office, with great Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of reſpect and veneration, as well knowing the bringing their Perſons and Function into diſreſpect, was the ready way (already attempted by the Debauchees of this Age) to bring their Doctrine into contempt. He valued thoſe moſt, who preached moſt to the <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Conſciences</hi> of a Sinner, and never diſliked a good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon becauſe it did not keep time with the glaſs.</p>
            <p>With much ſenſe he expreſſed his diſlike of ſeeing the <hi>Pulpit</hi> converted into a <hi>Stage,</hi> wherein men vented their Heats and Singularities, and diſcovered more of Spleen, Pride and Paſſion, than of being inſpired with the Spirit of that Holy Jeſus, in whoſe Name they pretend to come,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:97753:24"/>
and whoſe mind they profeſs to Reveal and Preach. He judged that Doctrine to be <hi>good,</hi> which tended to make men ſo, and much abhorred gingling and quibbling, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Cadencies of Words, and all frothineſs and levity of expreſſion, conceited, faſhionable, and phantaſtical Phraſes; he beſt like thoſe Diſcourſes which preſſed moſt a <hi>holy and ſtrict life</hi> in theſe licentious and profane days, and Catholick and Univerſal Charity in theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, and divided times; ſuch which urged men to be at peace with God, and one another. It was a good ſign of a ſpiritual Appetite, that he liked more the favourineſs of the Meat, than the garniſhing of the Diſh.</p>
            <p>He was <hi>vir ſine plicis,</hi> without <hi>foldings</hi> and <hi>twiſtings,</hi> a true hearted man to his Friend, a ſtranger to that much ſtudied Art of flattering and hating at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>In his Converſe and Friendſhip, Cordial and Faithful, without baſeneſs, or low diſſimulation.</p>
            <p>I boldly affirm him a man free from revenge. I ſay not, but he had a ſenſe of perſonal injuries, and eſpecially of thoſe that reflected on his name; principally, when they proceeded from thoſe who had <hi>good names</hi> themſelves. What others ſaid, he diſpiſed, but often wiſhed he had been better underſtood by ſome; and that he was not, he bore as his misfortune; yet would not requite them with the like meaſure, but mentioned them with all due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, being always ready to oblige them, and to do them good. Tho he was a man naturally of a great ſpirit and courage, of that perſonal valour, as if nothing but <hi>Steel</hi> had gone to his compoſition, his eyes being ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all impreſſions of fear and terror; yet no man more gentle, or eaſie to be intreated, more yielding or deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of reconciliation, of which I could give very preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant inſtances.</p>
            <p>I muſt not omit his <hi>exemplary Charity.</hi> It was of the right ſtamp, <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>private,</hi> I knew it to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97753:24"/>
and large, and very far from Oſtentation. As he did not rob himſelf, <hi>(for I count every Miſer a thief to his own Body),</hi> ſo neither did he rob the poor. Oppreſſion, or withholding the hire of the Labourer will never come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Indictment. What eſtate God bleſſed him with, was neither procured or enlarged by defrauding or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching his neighbour. Whilſt he was a Houſe-keeper and Maſter of a Family, he reckoned more belonged to his <hi>Table,</hi> than they that ſlept under his <hi>Roof,</hi> and therefore with his own hand firſt divided and ſent a Portion to them, before he took his own: And (which I think was hardly known to any but my ſelf), he did as duly furniſh one purſe with money, to diſtribute amongſt the indigent <hi>(tho not begging poor),</hi> as he filled another for his ordinary Expences, and made their Dividend equal with his own. The Age we live in, hath much of the <hi>Lamp</hi> of Profeſſion, but little of the <hi>Oyl</hi> of Charity. 'Tis the ſin and curſe of many rich Earth-worms to have with a <hi>flouriſhing Eſtate,</hi> a <hi>withered Hand,</hi> which they ſtretch not forth to good uſes. It was a ſtartling and rouſing paſſage of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome, Feed the hungry while you live, that you feed not the fire of Hell when you die.</hi> 'Tis ſad to drink in a full Cup our ſelves, and not to let one drop to fall beſide, to refreſh the bowels of a poor neighbour.</p>
            <p>What he was in his relative capacity, you his Children and Servants can bear me witneſs that <hi>I ſpeak the truth, and lie not,</hi> when I affirm him to have been a tender, compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate and provident Father; and a worthy, kind, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Maſter; <hi>a good friend, and no bad enemy.</hi> Report gives him an honourable Paſs. The Voice of all (as far as it reaches my ears) proclaims him a uſeful good man, a true friend, a juſt perſon, of a moſt obliging Converſation, having plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of ſpirit, without levity; freedom and affability of carriage, yet ſtill with gravity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:97753:25"/>Of what uſe he was in his publick Station, will beſt be diſcovered hereafter; you will know how great the tree that's fall'n was, by the vacuity or void place it leaves behind it, which every ſlight ſtick of wood will not ſupply and fill up.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, he lived to a good old Age, he came up to the Standard of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Threeſcore years and ten, and now is gathered to his Fathers, we hope. For not only Charity, but common reaſon thinketh no evil, where it findeth ſo many Evidences of good. I cloſe all with a word of Advice and Counſel, as knowing theſe Solemnities are not <hi>ad juvandas animas,</hi> as a great <hi>Cardinal</hi> upon his ſingle Affidavit would require us to believe; nor are they <hi>mortuorum adjutoria,</hi> as a great Schoolman would perſwade us; but they are <hi>vivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſolatia &amp; documenta,</hi> They call upon us to read our own diſſolution in this of our Brothers.</p>
            <p>Anatomiſts and Phyſitians advantage themſelves by the Diſſection of dead Bodies: So may we by this gloomy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence improve our skill in the two <hi>great Arts,</hi> of <hi>living Godly,</hi> and <hi>dying Bleſſedly.</hi> Tho the occaſion of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling together is <hi>Mournful,</hi> yet the fruit will be <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable,</hi> if we who ſurvive are forwarded in our preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our change, and do ſomething towards our chearful repoſe in the Grave, without diſtracting Fears of that King of Terrors; and ſince no ingredients in the ſhop of Nature, are ſufficiently Cordial to fortifie the heart againſt this ghaſhly Enemy, or his Harbingers; it will be no leſs our Wiſdom and Intereſt, than it is our Duty and Obligation to provide our ſelves with them, out of that Divine Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory of the ſacred Scriptures, where in great abundance, and on eaſie terms they are tendred to us, by him who is the <hi>God of all Conſolations.</hi>
