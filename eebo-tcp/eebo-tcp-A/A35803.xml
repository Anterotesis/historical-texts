            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>By a Perſon of QUALITY.</byline>
            <l>ALas, what has this poor Animal done,</l>
            <l>That ſhe ſtands thus before the riſing Sun,</l>
            <l>In all the heats of Infamy and Diſgrace,</l>
            <l>The ſure Remarks of a bold Brazen-face?</l>
            <l>Truly for no great hurt, nor for much harm;</l>
            <l>Only inventing to ſpill Royal Blood, to keep it warm;</l>
            <l>Fire Cities, Burn Houſes, and devaſt Nations;</l>
            <l>Ruine us in all our ſeveral ſtations.</l>
            <l>But who would think it from the Woman fine,</l>
            <l>A thing whom Nature itſelf has made Divine,</l>
            <l>That ſhe ſhould act ſuch horrid barbarous things,</l>
            <l>As to deſign to ſtab Stateſmen, and to Murder KINGS?</l>
            <l>But here ſhe ſtill appears for her ill acts,</l>
            <l>Like ſecond ſtorms after Thunder-claps.</l>
            <l>Philoſophers tell us, <hi>the beſt things corrupted are the worſt,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And from their own fine ſpecies are ever curſt.</l>
            <l>When once we take to Ill and Vices Road,</l>
            <l>We then paint out our ſelves much like the Toad;</l>
            <l>Since Vice not only horrid is from the being of Nature,</l>
            <l>But alſo from the thing itſelf, and from its own feature.</l>
            <l>Who makes us look at once, and that ſeveral ways,</l>
            <l>Like Squinting people, from their falſe Optick Rays.</l>
            <l>This teaches us therefore how a ſtrange a thing is Religion,</l>
            <l>That makes one a Vulture, the other a Raven, and the other a Widgeon;</l>
            <l>To be ſo very falſe, in the inſtructing thoſe</l>
            <l>To commit ſuch horrid acts, and with them cloſe:</l>
            <l>As what is opened and preſented here,</l>
            <l>By a Popiſh Midwife, called Madam <hi>Cellier.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Go to therefore, all ye Papiſts and Men of the Red Letter,</l>
            <l>Would you but ſeriouſly conſider of it, you would do much better</l>
            <l>Then Plot ſuch ſecret villanies againſt the State,</l>
            <l>The direful operations of your ungodly hate,</l>
            <l>As wilfully to deſtroy your fellow-Creatures all,</l>
            <l>And butcher them to their Eternal Funeral.</l>
            <l>But, Lord, what can theſe Souls plead before thee,</l>
            <l>When they ſo wilfully flie to their own miſery?</l>

            <l>Since from his fall he only deals in falls,</l>

            <l>Therefore as we would eſcape Infamy and puniſhment here,</l>
            <l>We muſt by Vertues Looking-glaſs ſee moſt clear;</l>
            <l>Since 'tis ſhe only, and that ſhe alone,</l>
            <l>That muſt conduct us to our eternal peaceful home,</l>
            <l>To the Heaven of joys, to that bliſs above,</l>
            <l>Where all are ſtroaked by the Pigeon and the Dove,</l>
            <l>To wit, by Angels, by good Men, and all Sages,</l>
            <l>To future times, and to ſucceeding Ages;</l>
            <l>While the wicked ſhall for ever undergo,</l>
            <l>In Hells deep pit everlaſting ſorrow,</l>
            <l>As a juſt reward for Treaſon, Murder, and Blood,</l>

            <l>While the Saint and Bravo lives in glory and pleaſure here,</l>

            <l>To act, proceed, and go forward in ill;</l>

            <l>Poor <hi>Cellier!</hi> you had better brought to bed</l>

            <l>By Dirt and Stones, and other warlike Arms.</l>
            <l>As in a Sea-ſtorm, one Prays, and the other Swears,</l>
