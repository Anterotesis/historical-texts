            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE COVNTRY MOVSE; AND The Citty Mouse.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>IN <hi>Italy,</hi> a Country rich in pleasure,</l>
               <l>Which nature had adorn'd with all her treasure,</l>
               <l>Both to delight the eye, and feed the sence;</l>
               <l>And seeming prodigall in her expence</l>
               <l>Had made the ayre sweete with the breath of flowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rs</l>
               <l>Which were begot by soft and gentle showres.</l>
               <l>Here on the bending of a Hill there stood,</l>
               <l>Some pleasant trees which made a shady wood,</l>
               <l>And here it chanced that a Country Mouse</l>
               <l>Did live alone, and kept a Country house.</l>
               <l>His house was not so spacious as those are</l>
               <l>Whose lofty Pinicles advanc'd with care</l>
               <l>May seeme the living grave of some rich man:</l>
               <l>Who does usurpe authority, and can</l>
               <l>In a faire roomy building, keepe a house</l>
               <l>Of such cleane dyet that shall starve a mouse.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:12498:3"/>
But such was not the Cottage, nor the Cave,</l>
               <l>Wherein this Country Mouse, did live most brave</l>
               <l>And most compleate, for though it were not large</l>
               <l>And spacious, yet this Mouse at his owne charge,</l>
               <l>Did keep a good warm house, wel stord with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</l>
               <l>The larders, nor the Butteries were not empty,</l>
               <l>As in these pinching dayes, no, he had store</l>
               <l>Of rich provision, and that is no soare.</l>
               <l>And first he had brave yellow Bacon, which</l>
               <l>For fatnesse was both glorious and rich,</l>
               <l>And some dry chippins that long time had beene</l>
               <l>Kept in the mouldy Prison of a Binne:</l>
               <l>Yet you must know this Country Mouse by nature</l>
               <l>Was but a covetous and hide bound creature,</l>
               <l>That stored up provision without end,</l>
               <l>Which he did choisely keepe and would not spend</l>
               <l>Vntill that hunger did compell, then he</l>
               <l>Vnto himselfe would somewhat liberall be.</l>
               <l>Yet he would feed alone, and oft did grutch</l>
               <l>To thinke his belly should devoure so much,</l>
               <l>The thought of a deere yeare kept him in awe,</l>
               <l>So that with Acornes he would scoure his mawe,</l>
               <l>With Acornes or with some farre courser fare,</l>
               <l>And as the Miser doth his God, would spare</l>
               <l>His chiefe provision, yet his narrow minde</l>
               <l>Did somewhat now enlarge, he grew more kinde:</l>
               <l>To counterfeit a vertue he nere had</l>
               <l>Liberality, he shewd himselfe right glad,</l>
               <l>That the City Mouse would come visite him</l>
               <l>In his poore Cottage, whereby it did seeme</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:12498:3"/>
He forgot not his poore friends, thus he went</l>
               <l>Forward with his dissembling complement.</l>
               <l>The City Mouse as cunning, did returne</l>
               <l>His Country Complement with a kind of scorne,</l>
               <l>Casting a looke on him which seem'd to pitty</l>
               <l>His ignorance that never knew the City,</l>
               <l>Imagining that Wit must be confin'd</l>
               <l>To Cloakes that are with Plush and Velvet lin'd:</l>
               <l>And that a Country man (as we doe say,)</l>
               <l>Hath not a mother wit as well as they.</l>
               <l>The City Mouse it seem'd conceived so,</l>
               <l>But now the Country Mouse begins to show</l>
               <l>Vnto the other all his roomes, contriv'd</l>
               <l>In such a manner, as if he had striv'd</l>
               <l>To imitate the Labarinth of Greece;</l>
               <l>Where <hi>Theseus</hi> obtaind the Golden Fleece.</l>
               <l>Being so intricate, for it did winde</l>
               <l>And turne about, so that no Art could finde</l>
               <l>The way out of it, and such was the Cave</l>
               <l>Wherein this Mouse did live, and wisely save</l>
               <l>His Fathers wealth, his parlour was thicke spred</l>
               <l>With rushes, which were dry and withered.</l>
               <l>I should at first indeed have nam'd the Hall,</l>
               <l>But that his house had no such roome at all,</l>
               <l>He kept no Liveries, nor did he feede</l>
               <l>A crue of serving Creatures, nor did neede</l>
               <l>A Hall wherein they might unto his credit</l>
               <l>Entertaine strangers, no he did not neede it,</l>
               <l>But scorning such old fashions, he had none,</l>
               <l>For entertainement but his dining roome:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:12498:4"/>
On this hand stood his Buttery where he laid</l>
               <l>The Meate and Chippins which he had convaid</l>
               <l>From rich mens houses, and there went a way,</l>
               <l>Which led unto a Seller, where there lay.</l>
               <l>Some Crabs, &amp; wildings with whose sharpe soure juce</l>
               <l>To quench his thirst he oftentimes did use,</l>
               <l>He had no greasie kitching, for his meate</l>
               <l>Was alwayes dressed, ready for to eate.</l>
               <l>Yet he had Larders where he layd his store,</l>
               <l>And a bed-chamber, with divers roomes more:</l>
               <l>For you must know, an old and ancient Mole,</l>
               <l>Was at the charge of building of this hole;</l>
               <l>And you doe know a Mole, can forthwith cast,</l>
               <l>A house at his owne proper charge and cost,</l>
               <l>Much workemanship, are in his models found,</l>
               <l>Although the building be still underground.</l>
               <l>And it did seeme, this faire house did belong</l>

               <l>And being defunct, both his goods and lands,</l>
               <l>As others doe, came to a strangers hands,</l>
               <l>But this is but a needlesse fond digression,</l>
               <l>The Country Mouse had gotten now possession,</l>
               <l>And warmely liv'd therein full many a day,</l>
               <l>And to the Lord of the soyle did not pay</l>
               <l>Any rent at all, which made him to grow bolder,</l>
               <l>Because he knew that he was a freeholder.</l>
               <l>But let this pass, the Country mouse having shown</l>
               <l>The Citty Mouse his house and every roome,</l>
               <l>As he had given content unto his sight,</l>
               <l>He thought to yeeld his stomacke some delight.</l>

For the belly when a mery tale it heares,</l>
               <l>Takes no delight because it hath no eares,</l>
               <l>The hungry belly loves no tales I wish,</l>
               <l>Vnlesse it be a Taile of buttered fish.</l>
               <l>It loves a pudding, wherein plumbs doe sticke,</l>
               <l>Better than <hi>Aristotles</hi> Rhetoricke.</l>
               <l>But I make haste now to describe the feast,</l>
               <l>Wherewith he did receive his dainty guest,</l>
               <l>So that <hi>Vitellius</hi> feasts though Sea, and Field,</l>
               <l>The earth, the ayre and all did freely yeeld</l>
               <l>Their severall sacrifices to his Table,</l>
               <l>Yet to compare with this they were not able.</l>
               <l>Yet not for store, but this was more compleate,</l>
               <l>Because it did exceede the dull conceit</l>
               <l>Of Cookes to make such, unles they turne theeves,</l>
               <l>When they doe make a dinner for the Shreeves.</l>
               <l>Sure not one bit of meat or bread was here,</l>
               <l>But had beene stollen before it came there.</l>
               <l>He set before him ground Oates for to fill</l>
               <l>His belly, which were stollen from a Mill,</l>
               <l>With Pease, and other Pulse, and yellow Bacon,</l>
               <l>In pecces, which he cunningly had taken</l>
               <l>Out of a Cubboard, for his time he spide,</l>
               <l>When the Mayd swallow'd sleepe by the fire side,</l>
               <l>When night grew old, and the candle burnt dim,</l>
               <l>Then presently to filch he did begin,</l>
               <l>Also some huskes of grapes which being prest,</l>
               <l>Last vintage had bled forth wine of the best.</l>
               <l>Also some fragments of dry Pasty Crust,</l>
               <l>Wherein some lushious meates to heighten lust,</l>

Had smoak't sometime, or else some Goose had been,</l>
               <l>Within this funerall Coffin closed in,</l>
               <l>Which at the private Sessions of a feast,</l>
               <l>Had beene carv'd round about to every guest.</l>
               <l>And thus the Country Mouse with change of fare</l>
               <l>To please the City Mouse, did take great care,</l>
               <l>That with variety he might yeeld delight,</l>
               <l>To the City Mouse, whose costly appetite,</l>
               <l>Expected greater cheare, and was so dainty,</l>
               <l>He scarce would taste of any, in such plenty</l>
               <l>And store of dishes: but the Country Mouse,</l>
               <l>(who may be stil'd the Master of the house,)</l>
               <l>At th' others nicenesse inwardly did laugh,</l>
               <l>And being laid along in this yeares chaffe,</l>
               <l>He onely fed upon dry Beanes and Pease,</l>
               <l>And Barley, or such other pulse as these,</l>
               <l>Or on hard Petches that might exercise</l>
               <l>His teeth, at these he closely nubling lies,</l>
               <l>But for the other dishes he did spare</l>
               <l>To tast them, since indeed he thought they were</l>
               <l>Too costly; for his sparing was too great</l>
               <l>To allow his belly any such good meate,</l>
               <l>T'was an affliction unto him to waste</l>
               <l>His store in such a manner, or to taste</l>
               <l>Of those same dishes; with which it did seeme,</l>
               <l>His stomacke never had acquainted beene.</l>
               <l>And herein he did lively represent</l>
               <l>Some Miser, whose minde is so closely bent</l>
               <l>Vpon his riches, that he does command</l>
               <l>The occasions of his life, to wait and stand</l>

               <l>For he pretends it will enflame his blood.</l>
               <l>And thus the Miser basely serves his purse,</l>
               <l>Money is not his blessing, but his curse,</l>
               <l>Who out of covetousnesse inures his Pallet</l>

               <l>With musty Vinegar, and no oyle at all,</l>
               <l>This is the man whom we a miser call.</l>
               <l>He with this Country Mouse doth well agree,</l>

               <l>But for him selfe he did allow the worst,</l>

               <l>Dispence with my blunt phrases for tis night,</l>
               <l>And to use many words would but afright</l>
               <l>The Servants in the house; if we should squeake</l>
               <l>In a loud key, out of their sleepe they'd breake.</l>
               <l>Content quoth the Country Mouse, let us fall</l>
               <l>About the meate, and make no noise at all.</l>
               <l>Withat the Country Mouse straightway did lay</l>
               <l>His teeth to a Ducke that was in his way,</l>

And spoyl'd the fashion of his wings then next</l>

               <l>His diet he began againe to range,</l>
               <l>And fasten on a Quaile, then on a Snipe,</l>
               <l>And all this while his mouth he did not wipe,</l>
               <l>Forgetting Ceremonies and all manners,</l>
               <l>For these two Mice had never learnt their Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mars</l>
               <l>Of morrall matters, or of Civillity,</l>
               <l>And therefore they scorn'd all formality:</l>
               <l>When they had eaten hard seeing such store</l>
               <l>The Country Mouse since he could eate no more,</l>
               <l>Was very sorry for he did never tast,</l>
               <l>Such dishes as had at this feast beene plac't.</l>
               <l>Before this time, so that he thus did say,</l>
               <l>Happy are such as eate and sport, and play.</l>
               <l>We may talke of wonders, but I thinke tis right</l>
               <l>That sensuall pleasures yeeld the most delight</l>
               <l>Though some tearm'd Clarks are more intelligible</l>
               <l>Yet Mice, and Maydens still are sensible,</l>
               <l>And this morrall Note I will gather hence</l>
               <l>The soule of pleasure lieth in the sense.</l>
               <l>Why doe we talke, yet why are we afeard?</l>
               <l>A Mouse is a Philosopher by his beard.</l>
               <l>But now all thankes unto the Citty Mouse</l>

               <l>I tell thee Citty Mouse, the Country can,</l>
               <l>Afford no pleasures unto Mouse or Man,</l>
               <l>For here I have what my desire can crave,</l>
               <l>There I am glad of chippings in a cave.</l>
               <l>And yet I thought them good, but now I finde,</l>
               <l>He that doth change his aire, doth chang his mind.</l>
               <l>If I talke beyond my compasse, I desire,</l>
               <l>To be excus'd, this cheare doth me inspire</l>

               <l>Some say that we should with a stomacke talke</l>
               <l>And let our tongues couragiously then walke</l>
               <l>But to talke without a stomacke sure is best</l>
               <l>When we have fild our stomacke at a feast.</l>
               <l>Nay quoth the Citty Mouse since you admire</l>

               <l>Each place doth seeme a paradise of pleasure,</l>
               <l>Wherein the Rich man spends his doting leasure,</l>
               <l>You are not cas'd up here within a cave,</l>

The thefts of Mice rich men doe scorne to see</l>
               <l>For in such places Mice may live most free,</l>
               <l>But a small fault committed by a Mouse</l>
               <l>Is soone discerned in a Country house.</l>
               <l>Here we may live, but as I said come see</l>
               <l>Those other roomes, which I will shew to thee.</l>
               <l>Thus usherd by the Citty Mouse they come</l>
               <l>At last into a faire neate dining Roome:</l>
               <l>With pictures hung about, there was a Frier,</l>
               <l>That to a Nunne it seemes had a desire</l>
               <l>He hugd her in his armes, and the warme zeale</l>
               <l>Which Fryers doe beare Nuns he did reveale.</l>
               <l>The Country Mouse, had a dull apprehension</l>
               <l>So that he tooke no pleasure in invention,</l>
               <l>Or to view that picture, but was more taken</l>
               <l>With the picture, of a gamon of Bacon,</l>
               <l>What sweete proportions are there quoth he?</l>
               <l>In this gamon, it is loves epitomie.</l>

               </l>
               <l>The tables in this dining roome were spred</l>
               <l>With Turkey carpets all embroidered.</l>
               <l>The stooles the cushions, and every chaire</l>
               <l>Of cloath of Silver and rich Tissue were</l>
               <l>Whereon young Gentlewomen, and Ladies might</l>
               <l>Sit, while their beauties shined forth more bright,</l>
               <l>Then their lesse glorious feate, but at this time</l>
               <l>The Country mouse into a chaire did climbe,</l>
               <l>But the other mouse upon the Table got,</l>
               <l>And presently it was his happy lot,</l>

To smell a dish of sweet conserves and plumbs,</l>
               <l>Then straightway he a little farther runnes</l>
               <l>And findes a dish of marchpaine, that was fram'd</l>
               <l>In the shape of a Castle, and had sustain'd,</l>
               <l>A most fierce seige, so that the structure quite</l>
               <l>Had beene demolisht for the guests delight.</l>
               <l>The Country Mouse thus seated in a chaire</l>
               <l>The Citty Mouse exprest much love and care</l>
               <l>In waiting on him and before him set</l>
               <l>A dish wherein was left some Marmalet,</l>
               <l>And then he brought him some sweet Sugar plums</l>
               <l>The Country Mouse thought these were pleasant crums.</l>
               <l>For he before had use to whet his teeth,</l>
               <l>On rusty Bacon, or upon hung Beefe:</l>
               <l>So that these sweetmeates seem'd to melt,</l>
               <l>Within his mouth before that they were felt.</l>
               <l>The Citty Mouse did still attending stand</l>
               <l>Waiting upon him ready at's command,</l>
               <l>And tasting unto him every dish least he</l>
               <l>Should suspect in him some foule treacherie.</l>
               <l>Much diligence he showd thereby to expresse</l>
               <l>What happinesse his present state did blesse.</l>
               <l>So that the plenty seem'd to upbraid</l>
               <l>The dinner which the Country Mouse had made.</l>
               <l>For the Citty Mouse, when he came to his Cave.</l>
               <l>No such varieties, for him could have</l>
               <l>In the Country, but his stomacke there was linde</l>
               <l>With such fare as the Country Mouse did finde</l>
               <l>Into some poore cupboord that stood open empty,</l>
               <l>But in the Citty he found store and plenty.</l>

The Country Mouse thus feasted with good cheat</l>
               <l>Did in a jocund humour soone appeare,</l>
               <l>And his conceits were sweetned so that he</l>
               <l>In a fine witty humour began to be</l>
               <l>And would needs discourse unto the Citty Mouse,</l>
               <l>Telling him that he lik't the rich mans house,</l>
               <l>For here quoth he, we shall doe wondrous well,</l>
               <l>And no body our knavery can smell,</l>
               <l>For if we to a rich mans house belong:</l>
               <l>We shall be honest doe we right or wrong.</l>
               <l>To walke a nights we neede not be afear'd</l>
               <l>For in the great roomes we shall not be heard;</l>
               <l>O quoth the Citty Mouse, I see you are wise,</l>
               <l>The Citty doth afford most rarities,</l>
               <l>And in the Citty rich mens houses be</l>
               <l>Places of pleasure, as you painely see,</l>
               <l>Besides all this you shall finde more delight</l>
               <l>For I will tell you 'twas my chance one night</l>
               <l>To heare a wooing match, and as I said</l>
               <l>The Butler was wooing the Chambermaide.</l>
               <l>I heard it all and when their candle grew</l>
               <l>Vnto a snufe, he did much boldnesse shew,</l>
               <l>So that he would have done I tell you plaine</l>
               <l>An act of darknesse which I will not name,</l>
               <l>You must conceive my meaning, but when he</l>
               <l>Imagin'd all the house in bed to be,</l>
               <l>I having behind the chamber wainscot got,</l>
               <l>Began to scrape, which he mistrusted not.</l>
               <l>And hindred him of that which he did meane,</l>
               <l>And put him quite out of his wooing Scene.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:12498:11"/>
For I was then even gnawing of a bone,</l>
               <l>Behind the wainscot, as I oft had done,</l>
               <l>But when the Butler, and the Mayd it heard</l>
               <l>They presently began to be afeard</l>
               <l>And through a little cranny I espy'd</l>
               <l>That both the Maids cheeks with a blush were di'd</l>
               <l>And so these Lovers, being both faint-hearted</l>
               <l>By a poore Mouse were frighted and soone parted</l>
               <l>For when I gnawd my bone againe, then they</l>
               <l>For feare they should be taken ran away.</l>
               <l>O then thought I, I doe observe by this</l>
               <l>That such are fearefull as intend amisse,</l>
               <l>And though they never thinke upon the devill</l>
               <l>A Mouse can fright them when they purpose evil.</l>
               <l>The Country Mouse, when he had heard his story</l>
               <l>Began to tell another in his glory.</l>
               <l>Some Maydens in the Country on a time</l>
               <l>Had made one night a Posset of good Wine.</l>
               <l>And thereunto their sweet hearts did envite</l>
               <l>Intending to be merry all that night;</l>
               <l>The Maydens and their Sweethearts merry were,</l>
               <l>When I did put them all into a feare.</l>
               <l>For I began to scrape behinde a wall,</l>
               <l>So that they straightway were affrighted all.</l>
               <l>They thought their mistresse had beene comming downe</l>
               <l>And so away they slipped every one,</l>
               <l>And as you said, thereby it did appeare</l>
               <l>That guilty minds of all things stand in feare.</l>
               <l>But O friend Citty Mouse what rare content?</l>
               <l>Shall we enjoy when we are resident,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:12498:11"/>
Here in the Citty; where each day and night</l>
               <l>Shall yeeld us choise varieties of delight.</l>
               <l>Here we shall feast our bodies with quaint dishes</l>
               <l>And in a word we shall have here our wishes.</l>
               <l>But when the Country Mouse these words had spoke</l>
               <l>One of the Maids began to turne the locke,</l>
               <l>Of the dining roome, because that she did meane</l>
               <l>As it did seeme to sweepe it very cleane,</l>
               <l>But then the Mice were put unto their Trumps</l>
               <l>One from the Tableleapes, and tother jumps</l>
               <l>Off from the Chaire, and so both round about</l>
               <l>They ran, but yet no hole they cold find out,</l>
               <l>So that behinde the hangings they did hide</l>
               <l>Themselves, and in a mortall feare did bide.</l>
               <l>Vntill the Mayd when she had swept the roome</l>
               <l>Went out and lockt the doore when she had done.</l>
               <l>But now the Mice being in a sweate for feare</l>
               <l>Came forth againe when that the coast was cleare,</l>
               <l>But the country mouse did then so quak &amp; tremble</l>
               <l>That you might plainely see he did not dissemble.</l>
               <l>And now the Servants did begin to rise</l>
               <l>And in the streets they heard a hundred cryes</l>
               <l>So that the Country Mouse was in a fright</l>
               <l>And wisht he had not come from home that night</l>
               <l>Thanking the Citty Mouse for his good cheare,</l>
               <l>Which he esteem'd he had bought too deare.</l>
               <l>He told the Citty Mouse he would repaire</l>
               <l>Vnto the Country where without all care</l>
               <l>He could live freely, telling him he thought</l>
               <l>Pleasure to deare, that with such feare is bought,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:12498:12"/>
Although my Country fare is not so dainty,</l>
               <l>Content is better unto me than plenty.</l>
               <l>There I can live most quietly under ground</l>
               <l>In a poore cave, and never there be found</l>
               <l>And when I list can goe unto a mill,</l>
               <l>And with ground corne my belly soundly fill</l>
               <l>To steale into a cubboard I'me not afraid</l>
               <l>For any Mouse may fright a Country Mayd,</l>
               <l>Especially if I doe sometimes proffer</l>
               <l>To creepe beneath her coates, she feares the offer</l>
               <l>And presently aloud the Mayde will screeke</l>
               <l>And then into some hole I straightway creepe</l>
               <l>And there I laugh to thinke the Mayd <hi>Ione</hi> can</l>
               <l>Thus feare a Mouse that does not feare a man.</l>
               <l>Therefore I thanke you for my cheare but I</l>
               <l>In the Country resolve to live and dye.</l>
               <l>Let me in quietnesse there spend my leasure</l>
               <l>For as I said content is my chiefe pleasure.</l>
               <l>But now the Crow with hollow voice did creake,</l>
               <l>And daylight did begin a pace to breake</l>
               <l>The Citty Mouse, a little on his way</l>
               <l>Did bring him, and then it did grow broad day,</l>
