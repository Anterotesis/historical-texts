            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the right Honourable, Sir VVilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am <hi>Cecill, Knight of the Garter, Baron of Burghley,</hi> Lorde high Treaſurer of England, and <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor of the Vniuerſitie of Cambridge,</hi> Grace and peace.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am (right Honourable) to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe my ſelfe in two thinges: the one, that I take vpon me to write againſt the Browniſts, ſeeing there be ſo many great learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in our land, which doo refraine: the other, that I doo offer ſo ſlender a peece of woorke vnto your Honour. Touching the former, the truth is, I haue beene vnwares drawne vnto it, not purpoſing any ſuch matter. For more then two yeares paſt, there were brought vnto me certaine articles which the Browniſts doo call, A breefe ſum of their profeſſion, with diuers arguments againſt read prayer. They were brought vnto me by a Scholemaiſter in Eſſex, who of a godly minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did deſire mee to write my iudgement of the ſame, which when I refuſed, hee vrged me with this, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe of the people about them were troubled, and did hang in ſuſpenſe, and for their ſakes he did require it, I did graunt his requeſt, and when they had my writings, they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the cheefe men of that ſect. Not long after, I receiued large replies, where I perceiued that which before I did not ſo much as dreame of, namely, that they had made chalenge, and looked to be encountred by the learnedeſt in the land. They take it greeuouſly, and reprehend me, as hauing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted this buſineſſe, and taken it from the hands of the learned. Heerevpon I ſtayed long, purpoſing to giue them but ſhorte anſwer to their chiefe matters. But when I ſawe that aduantage was taken, as if I had receiued matters vnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable,
<pb facs="tcp:14667:3"/>
and that Browniſme did begin to ſpred in manye places of the land: I thought it not amiſſe, ſeeing the burthen thus to haue light vpon me, though I be not able to deale ſo ſufficiently as ſuch a matter requireth: yet to publiſh to the world ſome of their hereſies, and frantike opinions, which are to be gathered from their writings. I haue not ſet downe the whole diſcourſe of wordes, which hath paſſed betweene them and me, for it would be ſomewhat tedious. But if any ſhall thinke I haue paſſed any reaſons of theirs vnanſwered, or wreſted their words from the true ſence, to gather here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: let them ſhew any particular, and I wil be able to cleere my ſelfe. And let men conſider, whether the Browniſme can be ſupported by any pillers, but thoſe hereſies which I haue noted. I meddle not with the controuerſies of our Church, but deale by way of admiſsion. I neuer receyued the names of any ſubſcribed to the writings I receiued, and for that cauſe I do name none. And now for the other point, why I preſume to offer it vnto your honour. God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen your honour to be an auncient graue Counſellor, and which many yeares haue borne, and ſtill doo beare, a great part of the waight of this our common-wealth, vnder her right excellent Maieſtie: and for that cauſe I iudge it meete your Honor ſhould ſee ſuch things as any way touch the generall eſtate. I truſt therefore, that although it be not for the ſlenderneſſe worthy to be offred to ſo honorable a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet it ſhall be accepted in ſome ſort. And touching your Honor, as I do not doubt of it but it ſhal be, ſo I wiſh &amp; pray to God, that you may be one of thoſe of whome it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. The righteous ſhall flouriſh like a palme tree, and ſhall growe like a Cedar in Lebanon. Being planted in the houſe of the Lord, they ſhall flouriſh in the Courtes of our God, they ſhall ſtill bring forth fruite in their age: they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing: to declare that the Lorde my rock is righteous, and that there is none iniquitie in him.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a thing of great wonder, to behold how God preſerueth his Church from drowning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in theſe greeuous times. The Deuill is ſo full of wrath, knowing his time is but ſhort, Reuel. 12. v. 12. that he raiſeth vp ſuch tempeſts &amp; whi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le windes, with ſuch lightning and thunders, with ſuch outragious ſurges and waues, as if heauen and earth ſhould bee mixed together. His cheefe Vaſſals, the tyrants and Heretikes, doo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully beſtirre them, to effect his curſſed deſires. By the one ſort hee dooth breath out terror, and as it were ſpit fire. By the other he ſpueth vp deadlye poiſon, and caſteth his poiſoned dartes. He is ſo ſubtill, that he tranſformeth himſelfe into the likeneſſe of an Angell of light, and his Miniſters come in faire cloakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For behold all ſortes of Heretikes and Schiſmatikes, and yee ſhall ſee fewe of them come in the Deuils liuerie. The Papiſts ſhrowde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder the name and title of the Catholike Church. Theſe cry out, the fathers, the fathers, the auncient Fathers. Theſe proclaime vs and all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which haue forſaken their fellowſhip, and imbraced the Goſpell, to be Schiſmatikes and Heretiks. Theſe affirme, that we haue no word of God, no Sacraments, nor Miniſtrie, becauſe we be cut off from them. Theſe preuaile mightelie among the blind ſuperſtitious people, who greedely drinke vp all the poiſon &amp; abhominations, which the Deuill hath ſpued vp into that faire golden cuppe in which they offer them, Reuel. 17. which is, that they be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes. There is riſen vp among vs a blinde ſect, oppoſite to theſe, which is ſo furious, that it commeth like a raging tempeſt from a contrary coaſt, ſo that our ſhip is toſſed betweene contrary waues. For theſe cry alowd, that our aſſemblies be Romiſh, idolatrous; antichriſtian Synagogs. That we worſhip the beaſt, receiue his marke, and ſtand vnder his yoake. And finally, that we haue no Miniſtery, no word of God nor Sacraments. Theſe pretend ſuch fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie of zeale againſt all falſe worſhip, ſuperſtition, and Idolatrie, and ſuch loue to the diſcipline of Chriſt, and crie ſo lowd, that a man would thinke he heard the voice of <hi>Elias,</hi> of <hi>Haggeus,</hi> and of that third Angel, Reu. 14. Downe with the Preeſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> come out from among them, worſhip not the beaſt, ariſe, ariſe, &amp; build the Temple and altar of the Lord. With this counterfet voice the Deuill ſeduceth many, and troubleth all ſuch as are weake, and yet haue zeale againſt falſe worſhip, trembling for feare of pollution: with this ſect onely haue I now to deale. Firſt therfore touching their name, we terme them <hi>Browniſts,</hi> as being the Diſciples &amp; Scholers of <hi>Browne.</hi> There be indeed new maſters ſprong vp, which ſeeke to carrie awaye the name, and I haue heard diuers ſay, they go beyond <hi>Browne.</hi> But whoſoeuer ſhal reade his books
<pb facs="tcp:14667:4"/>
and peruſe all their writings, ſhall well ſee, that he deſerueth to haue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if any be, and to be called the Captaine and maiſter of them all. They haue all their furniture from him: they do but open his packe, and diſplaye his wares. They haue not a ſharpe arrowe, which is not drawne out of his quiuer.</p>
            <p>Then next, touching the queſtion betweene them and me, let the reader conſider, it is not about the controuerſie in our Church, as whether there be imperfections, corruptions, and faults, in our worſhip, miniſterie, and church gouernment, nor how many, great or ſmall. But whether there be ſuch hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous enormities, as deſtroy the verye life and being of a true Church, and make an vtter diuorſe from Chriſt. I will lay it open more plaine by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon which the Scripture vſeth. The Church is like a man, in whom there be many parts and members. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. If all the parts or members of the body haue their iuſt proportion, be whole and ſound, and ſet in their due order, the ſoule and life departed, he is no longer a man, to ſpeake properly, but the dead carcaſſe of a man. But now if he be ſicke and diſeaſed, ſo that all partes are feeble, or if he be deformed with ſores and maimes, wanting hand, foote, eye, noſe, or ſuch like, yet is he ſtill a man, ſo long as the ſoule and life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in him. All men doo know this to be true, yea euen the ſimpleſt make no doubt or controuerſie about it. Let vs ſee therefore whether it be a fitte compariſon with the Church, and whether it be ſo in it of neceſſitie, and as manifeſt by the doctrine of the holy ſcriptures, as this other is vnto our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſenſes.</p>
            <p>To finde this, we muſt firſt conſider, whether there be no true Church of GOD, but that which is perfect in this worlde? Wee knowe that there are none but Heretikes, yea ranke abhominable heretikes, which obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny this cleere doctrine of the holy Scriptures, namely, that euen the moſt faithfull, and the moſt godly, are not perfect while they liue vpon the earth. We know but in part. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. In many things we ſinne all. <hi>Iam. 3. v.</hi> 2. And who vnderſtandeth his errors, or who can tell how oft he offendeth? <hi>Pſal</hi> 19. The perfecteſt members of the Church doo erre, doo ſinne, are mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, are weake, are ſpotted and deformed many wayes. Nowe, whereas all the members be in this caſe, needes muſt the whole body which is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of them be in the ſame eſtate. Then we may not looke for a Church in this world, which is not ſpotted, deformed, maymed, and weake, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
            <p>But the queſtion muſt bee, how farre it may bee deformed and maimed, and yet remaine aliue, and ſo a true Church of God. Let all the partes bee ioyned together: let there be all ſortes of officers and offices, yet if the life, and as it were the ſoule of the Church be wanting, it is but a dead carcaſſe. Contrarywiſe, let there be ſome members wanting, ſome maimed, all parts deformed and weake, yet is it a true Church of God, ſo long as the ſoule and life dooth remaine in it. And what is the ſoule and life of the Church? Ieſus Chriſt apprehended by faith. I liue now, ſaith Saint Paul, but not any longer I, but Chriſt liueth in me, <hi>Galath. 2. ver.</hi> 20. All the members of the
<pb facs="tcp:14667:4"/>
Church are incorporate, and graffed into Chriſt by faith, and doo growe in him, and through the operation of his ſpirite receiue the iuice and ſappe of life from him, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15. Whoſoeuer beleeueth in the Sonne of God, ſhall be ſaued, though he be full of errors, full of infirmities, and deformities, both in body and ſoule, labouring to be purged.</p>
            <p>But if a man, or an aſſembly do hold that which ouerthroweth the faith in Chriſt, they are gone, there is no life remaining. As the Papacie holdeth many things aright touching Chriſt; but it holdeth ſundry things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which ouerthrow the very foundation of the faith, and ſo the Papacie it ſelfe is not Gods true Church.</p>
            <p>Thus haue I laide open the queſtion, betweene mee and the <hi>Browniſts:</hi> wherein then are the Maiſters and Capitaines of <hi>Browniſme</hi> deceiued? And what is it, in which they ſeeke victorie and glory? They knowe there is no ſinne, no error, no corruption, nor no abuſe, but that if all the learnedeſt in the worlde would take vpon them to cleere and to defend the ſame, they ſhall not be able. Then they are deſirous of victorie, of triumphe and glorye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ouer all both wiſe and learned. Heere therefore they entrench themſelues, they make their Bulwarkes, plant their ordinance, ſet themſelues in arraye, and ſound the Trumpet of defiance againſt all. They preſume, none ſhall euer be able to driue them out of their holde. And indeed, he that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth an error, and goeth no further, can neuer be vanquiſhed. But heerein they are deceiued, that out of this Forte they will batter downe the Church. For theyr ordinance is ouer weake for that: they ſtoppe in powder in great plenty, for they laye on toong enough, and ſo make terrible thundering crakes. But the Bullets which come foorth, and which ſhould doo the deed, are nothing but hereticall, erronious, and fantaſticall opinions, and ſo all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth into ſmoake. They muſt therefore at the laſt, leaue their holde, and take them to their heeles, for Gods Church will not be battered downe by any aſſaults of Schiſmatikes.</p>
            <p>Some will thinke hardly, that I terme them Schiſmatikes, ſeeing they be men that are accounted zealous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſtand for good things. But the truth is, they be not onely a Schiſme, yea a vile Schiſme, rending themſelues from the Church of England, and condemning by their aſſertions, the whole vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church in the worlde, euen as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did of olde time: but alſo they maintaine hereſies, and ſome that touche the very foundation of faith and Chriſtian religion: they be vtter violaters of eccleſiaſticall diſcipline, they abridge the power of the ciuill Magiſtrate, beſide ſundry fantaſticall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. For when as the life of the church conſiſteth in the apprehenſson of Chriſt through faith, it muſt needs be an hereſie, to conclude as they doo, a <hi>nullitie,</hi> &amp; a quite ouerthrow of the ſame, from errors &amp; faults which are not fundamentall. Faith and regeneration being vnperfect, in all that liue vpon the earth, it is heriticall, to ſay, that is no Church of God, which holding the ſounde doctrine, hath ſinnes and great abuſes in it.</p>
            <p>The ſtableneſſe of Gods couenant towarde the Church, being founded onely vpon his free grace, it is deteſtable impietie, to hang it vpon the works
<pb facs="tcp:14667:5"/>
of men, as the <hi>Browniſts</hi> do, when they affyrme, that where there is any open ſinnes ſuffered in an aſſemblie, the couenant is diſanulled with them all. And if men conſider well, they ſhall finde that the whole <hi>Browniſme</hi> reſteth vppon the hereſie of perfection and Anabaptiſticall freedome. For from hence, that it is written, <hi>Ieruſalem from aboue is the mother of vs all, and is free with her children.</hi> They boaſt of ſuch freedome, as that touching outwarde orders, the Prince and Church hath no power to impoſe any thing by Lawes and Conſtitutions. Which is one thing wherein they do not onely abridge the power of the Chriſtian Magiſtrates, denying them the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to reforme the Church, and to compell their ſubiects to the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſpoyling the Church of that comfortable ayd: but alſo condemne all reformed Churches which haue orders and preſcript formes of prayers impoſed, which theſe <hi>Browniſts</hi> tearme Idolatrie, a tradition bringing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie into bondage, and therefore a thing moſt deteſtable. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, they hold ſuch a perfect freedome from all ſpirituall bondage of ſinne, that they affyrme <hi>S. Paule</hi> neuer conſented to wicked thoughts after he was regenerate. But in an other place they affyrme, that all men be Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and can keepe no one Commaundement: where they are both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to themſelues, vttering that which ouerthroweth the whole <hi>Browniſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and alſo ſpeake groſely. For albeit there is no man perfect in any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, yet the holy Scriptures do not call them Idolaters nor adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers. They boldly gayne ſay the holy Ghoſt, by affirming that the Pſalmes were not to be ſung vnto God. And touching the diſcipline, which is the thing they moſt glorie of, as if they ſuffered for it: let all men know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie, that they be not only ignorant what it is, but alſo do in their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe breake and ouerthrow the very pith and ſubſtance thereof in the chiefe rules. For they take vpon them to abandon and caſt foorth whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyes which profeſſe the Goſpell, and haue their eſtimation and dignitie among all godly Churches, without obſeruing the rule giuen by our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 18. They intrude themſelues without calling, beeing meere priuate men, to the erecting and eſtabliſhing of a publike gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, forgetting that which is written, <hi>I haue not ſent them, and yet they runne.</hi> They cut off alſo the power of the Church in a great part of the diſcipline, as namely, in ordeyning conſtitutions in things that are variable. Finally touching this poynt, I may ſay boldly, the Diuell can no way almoſt more diſgrace Eccleſiaſticall gouernment then he doth by them, for it is the Sterne of Chriſtes Ship, and requireth men of the greateſt wiſedome, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, experience, and ſobrietie that may be, for to guide it. Now when the common Artificer, the Apprentiſe and the Bruer intrude themſelues, and they will guide the ſame, being ignorant, raſh, and headie, what worldlie wiſe man will not take it, that diſcipline her ſelfe is but a bedlem? Who will aduenture himſelfe in that Ship, where preſumptuous ignorance, and bold frenſie doth ſit at the Helme? Shall that Ship eſcape the rockes? If it would pleaſe God to giue <hi>Browne</hi> the grace to repent, and to ſpeake the truth, he could beſt declare this thing. For when he had with certayne other, drawne
<pb facs="tcp:14667:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſome both men and women ouer the Seas, and there ſpread his Sayles, how ſoone did his ſilly Boate daſh vppon the rocke, and was clouen in two or three peeces? Let not men be deceyued with euery vayne ſhewe, for vndoubtedly, he that obſerueth ſhall finde, that the end of <hi>Browniſme,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Schiſmes, Hereſies, Atheiſme, and Barbariſme. For what other fruites can followe of the diſgracing and condemning the liberall Artes, of bringing the miniſterie of Gods Word, by which the religion and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines that is in men, hath been <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rought into vtter contempt? What can followe from immoderate outragious raſh furie, wrath, and bitter zeale, and vainglorious contention, which are earthly, ſenſuall, and diueliſh? If men could ſtay themſelues but a while, and ſee whether the ſame things ſpring not foorth, which came from the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and Anabaptiſts, it were well. For it is to be wondred at, that any which profeſſe the Goſpell, ſhould be ſeduced and called away not only from the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that haue taught them, but from all the moſt worthy men and Churches vnder heauen, and that by the voyce of the Deuill in ſuch furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blinde Schiſmatikes. In deede there be two ſpeciall cauſes of it: the one, that ſundry men receyue not the holy Word of God in humilitie, with feare and trembling, with conſcience to practiſe, but are puffed vp, and ſwell with opinion of their knowledge, as ſoone as they can vtter a fewe words: and growe vnto vayne iangling, yea, vnto bitter zeale, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, in ſtead of being quiet (as <hi>S. Paule</hi> willeth) and medling with their own buſines, 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. and alſo in ſtead of following after righteouſnes, faith and loue, 2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>He that ſeemeth moſt zealous in religion, and refraineth not his toong, hath but bitterneſſe in ſteed of heauenly zeale. For wheras, in ſteed of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe, meekeneſſe, patience, mercie, and loue, yee finde wrath, fierceneſſe, intemperat rage, vncharitable condemning and ſlaundering, know for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that the true zeale is not there. The other cauſe of mens ſeducing, is that in this corrupt age there be many ſtumbling blockes, and greeuous offences: where indeed, it is the part and duty of euery true Chriſtian man, beſide the taking heede to his owne wayes, moſt inſtantly to offer vp praiers and ſupplications to God, to intreate him to ſhew mercie and compaſſion vpon vs, by increaſing all heauenly graces and giftes of his holy ſpirit in our moſt noble Queene, and in all Gouernours, both ciuill and eccleſiaſticall, that there may be feruent zeale to purge the houſe of God, and to take away the cauſes of contention, that we may not alwaies ſeeke to deuoure one an other, but that vnity and concord may floriſh, holding this withall, that it is alſo euery mans dutie that will feare God, to giue him hearty thanks for the ineſtimable treaſures and bleſſings which he hath beſtowed vpon vs, by meanes of the happy raigne of our gratious Soueraigne: and to take heed of that malignant ſpirite of Browniſme, which would carry vs to this wicked opinion, that ſhe bearing the Sworde of God, hath doone no more for vs then an Heathen Prince might doo. For if we haue no word of God, no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, no Sacraments nor viſible Church, but all idolatrous and antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb facs="tcp:14667:6"/>
what hath ſhe done, what honor can ſhe haue for defence of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell? This is no ſmall diſhonour and iniurie to a Chriſtian Prince, thus to diminiſh the loue of the ſubiects. The Lord giue them repentance, and grace, to ceaſe from ſuch impietie; and let all men with modeſtie, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and ſubiection, and not with reproch and contempt, ſeeke the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe of abuſes at their hands which be in Authoritie: and not aduenture like <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> to intrude themſelues without calling and warrant from God. They cryed out, are not all the Lords people holy? and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> yee take too much vppon yee. The <hi>Browniſt</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymeth, that all the Lords people are free, and therefore freely to deale, and not to haue any thing impoſed by any. Be not deceyued, but knowe for certaintie, that they be full and rancke <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in part. I knowe it is complayned of, that there be ſo many and ſo diuers Sectes and Hereſies dayly ſpringing vp where the Goſpell is preached, for it ſeemeth a foule diſgrace both to the Goſpell it ſelfe, and to the Preachers. There are, ſay ſome, at the leaſt fifty ſeuerall ſectes. Behold, ſay others, how the people are lead without ground, and haue no ſtay but are caryed without ende from one thing to another. What is the cauſe? is not the preaching? is there any thing deliuered which is certayne? are not the fruites of theyr Sermons, factions, and Schiſmes? Theſe ſpeeches do ſo abaſh and trouble ſome, that they are driuen backe, and retyre into flat Poperie, as into a ſafe hauen, which yet in truth is the gulfe of all Schiſmes and abhominable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies Others are ſo much diſpleaſed, that they become Atheiſts, and care not much for any Religion, though of both they doo rather fauour the Poperie. A third ſort there be which did runne, and now ſtand ſtill and wonder: they knowe not whether they were beſt to goe backe or forward. Their loue and zeale is decayed, and readie vtterly to be quenched. It is wonderfull that there ſhould be ſuch blindnes in men, and want of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to conſider rightly of all cauſes and effects. The Scriptures are cleere that light is come into the world, and men loue darkneſſe more then light, becauſe their works be euill. And what followeth heerevpon, becauſe they receyue not the loue of the truth, that they might be ſaued: God doth ſend them ſtrong deluſion to beleeue lyes, that they may be damned, 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. It is the heauie iudgement of God vppon the wicked world, that Satan is let looſe to ſeduce and leade into error. Men are worthie of ſuch a plague, and it doth come vppon them to the full: for they be not able now to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the truth, but do reproch and blaſpheme it, ſeeking the diſgrace of ſuch as do bring it. Moreouer, the Scriptures do ſhewe, that God hath an other purpoſe in ſending ſtrong deluſion, and the efficacie of error, and that is touching his elect, for they be clogged with the fleſhe, ſlowe and dull to ſearch out the truth: they be readie to leane to their owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and ſeeke not vnto God. When Schiſmes and Hereſies ariſe, it doth awaken them, cauſeth them to ſearch more diligently, yea, to ſeeke vnto God, and to depend wholly vppon him for light and inſtruction. It cauſeth them to feare and tremble in humilitie, and to make precious account of
<pb facs="tcp:14667:6"/>
the truth when they haue once found it: ſeeing the Deuill laboureth ſo mightely to depriue them of it by quenching the light. I heare (ſayth <hi>S. Paule</hi>) that there be Schiſmes among ye, and I do in part beleeue it: for there muſt be Hereſies, that ſuch as are approued, may be made manifeſt, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. When we ſee it come to paſſe, that through the malice and craft of the Deuill and his inſtruments ſuch confuſion doth ouerſpread all, let vs not loue the Goſpell the worſe, let vs not blaſpheme it, but knowe it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs vpon to be more carefull. The bleſſed Apoſtles themſelues had to encounter with Heretikes and falſe Apoſtles, and full cunningly did Satan winde in himſelfe in their dayes. When they were taken away, what troups of Heretikes did he ſend foorth? what blaſphemies and deteſtable furies did he vtter and ſpread by them? how were all the auncient Doctors and holy Fathers in the Churches ſet on worke to confute them, and to defend the true Chriſtian people from infection? Why then ſhould we nowe be daunted? or why ſhould it be any reproch to the holy Doctrine now more then of old, that the Diuell, where any light is ſhewed, doth followe it by and by at the heeles, to worke diſgrace? Let the miniſters of Gods Word looke diligently to theyr flockes, and teach them the wholeſome pure Doctrine, and the way of Sanctification. Let true zeale ſpring afreſh, which nowe ſuffreth great contempt, becauſe there is a mad bedlem riſen vp, which nameth her ſelfe by her name. There be diuers which cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt zeale very naughtely, when it is moſt certayne no man can haue ouermuch godly zeale, eſpecially in theſe dayes, wherein, who almoſt hath any hote loue for the glorie of God, and the ſaluation of his people? If Chriſt ſhould ſpeake, what other ſentence can we looke for, but that which he vttered of the Church of <hi>Laodicea, Reuel.</hi> 3. Thou art neyther hote nor cold. But let vs come to the matter in hand.</p>

In a particular Church there be errors and ſinnes, I will not ſaye in many, but in all, in as much as euery one hath his blindneſſe and corruption, erreth and ſinneth continuallye one waye or other. From hence it commeth, that of neceſſitie there be alwaies in the Church di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities of opinions, diſcord, diuiſion, and diſſention, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny corruptions and abuſes. For if it be moſt manifeſt, that the learnedeſt and godlieſt that liueth, doth carrie with him his errors, defects, and corruptions: what ſhal we looke for where the multitude is of learned, vnlearned, ſtrong and weake, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, how innumerable will the frailties and corruptions now among all be: wherevpon it followeth, that the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church cannot rightly cut off and vtterly abandon anye particular aſſemblies, vnleſſe it be for errors &amp; abuſes which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14667:10"/>
ouerthrow the faith, &amp; deſtroy true Chriſtianity. The precept of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> in that whervnto we are come, let vs procéed by one rule, to be like minded, <hi>Phi. 3.</hi> is héer to take place. I will now procéed more particularly. The church of England, euen as it generally ſtandeth in the publike aſſemblies, among al godly Churches which know the faith which ſhe dooth openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and maintaine, hath the place &amp; dignity of a ſiſter: They all giue vnto her the right hand of fellowſhip, acknowledging her for a mother in Iſrael, in as much as ſhe hath not béene barren, but hath brought foorth many deare children to God, and not a few of them crowned with martyrdome. Behold then the inordinate dealing, and arrogant preſumption of you <hi>Browniſts.</hi> Yea behold euen the top of your pride, againſt God and man, which profeſſing to ſet vp diſcipline, and glorying that you ſuffer for it, do breake and vtterly aboliſh the rules thereof giuen by Chriſt, by your vtter forſaking and abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the aſſemblies in England: for let it bee confeſſed, that the errors, the ſinnes, the imperfections, the ſpots, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities of our Church be many, ſo that ſhe is not in her ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall eſtate, ſo faire as the faireſt of her ſiſters: yet hath ſhe héeretofore had, and now hath, many noble children, richlye adorned with heauenly iewels, and pretious gifts of learning knowledge, faith, and godlineſſe. And howſoeuer the Papiſts one way, and the Browniſts another way, do aggrauate her crimes with peſtilent ſlaunders, yet ſhall they neuer prooue, that either in doctrine or manners ſhe is guilty of any funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall crime, which ſeparateth from Chriſt, and deſtroyeth the life and being of a true Church: yet you Browniſts, not obſeruing the rule giuen by Chriſt, doo vtterly abandon and caſt foorth from their dignitie, all our aſſemblies in England. For ye haue condemned al of wilful obſtinacy, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members: &amp; who hath giuen you this authoritie to thruſt them out of Gods familie, which the whole vniuerſall Church cannot rightly doo? Who could euer imagine, that vnder the pretence of ſetting vp diſcipline, the diuell ſhould breath ſuch pride into rotten fleſh, as vtterly to ouerthrow the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it: for whereas all the Churches of Chriſt in theſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14667:10"/>
parts of the world, doo know the eſtate of our Church, and be able to diſcerne the gréeuouſneſſe of our errors: yet doo they all acknowledge and reuerence our aſſemblies as holye ſiſters. And you Browniſts, men voide of knowledge and diſcretion, without authoritie, without any calling or warrant, euen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a frantike brauerie, and without obſeruing any rule giuen by Chriſt Ieſus, take vpon ye moſt preſumptuouſly contrary to the iudgement of the Churches, to caſt foorth and vtterly to abandon the ſame. What Pope hath dealt more proudly in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating the diſcipline? If there were but this one thing againſt you, it were ſufficient to declare your curſed dealing, but your furies are many, firſt in your ſlaunderous accuſations, which now we come vnto.</p>

               <p>I did not, nor doo not deny the firſt part of this argument, the propoſition, ſo that we vnderſtand by falſe maner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the ſame made of the inuention of man, ſuch a falſe manner as dooth ouerthrow the very ground and foundation of faith, and make an vtter ſeperation from the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.

               </p>
               <p>Now to come vnto the ſecond part of your argument, the aſſumption, which is, that the Church of England dooth wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the true God after a falſe manner, their worſhip being made of, &amp;c. I did deny that, by affirming that the worſhip of our Church, is the imbracing the holy Bible, by the doctrine thereof, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ye ſay, I beg the queſtion, and prooue not our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by the Bible. And I ſay (if yée call it begging) you beg the queſtion, &amp; would haue that graunted vnto yée as true, which is moſt falſe. For excepting imperfections, wants, ſpots, ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, &amp; faults, which deſtroy not the true worſhip of God, our Church dooth worſhip the Lord aright, without hereſie, blaſphemy, or idolatry. The doctrine of our Church is publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: if yée can take exception againſt any point, to be hereſie or blaſphemie, bring it foorth that it may be tried by the Bible. Then next yée complaine further, that I do not anſwer one of thoſe 4. apparant reaſons which yée bring, why it is falſe and contrary to the Bible. Well then they may now be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Thus yée haue noted them with figures ouer the head, our worſhip being made of the <hi rend="sup">1</hi> inuention of man, euen of the <hi rend="sup">2</hi> man of ſinne, <hi rend="sup">3</hi> erronious, and <hi rend="sup">4</hi> impoſed vpon vs. I know not for what cauſe they ſhould be called apparant, vnleſſe by a farre fetched trope of Metonymie, becauſe they manifeſt and make apparant your vanitie, and Anabaptiſticall error. For the firſt thrée be no more but one bare affirmation of that principall tranſgreſſion which yée charge vs withall. For all falſe worſhip is mans inuention, whether it be the inuention of the man of ſinne, or of any other man, it is all one before God, who reſpecteth not perſons, but the wickedneſſe of the ſinne. Alſo to be mans inuention in Gods worſhip, and to be erronious is all one. For whatſoeuer man inuenteth in Gods worſhip, is erronious: and whatſoeuer in the ſame is erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, hath béene inuented by man. So that the thrée firſt are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14667:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all one bare affirmation, and the very ſame with your article. Your Anabaptiſticall error is in the fourth: for yée challenge ſuch a fréedome to the Church, as that nothing may be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon the flockes, no not any thing that the Church gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſhall decrée by the word, which dooth ouerthrow the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in a great part. Then yée procéed and ſay, for further manifeſtation of our worſhip in particular, let the booke of Common prayer be examined by the word of God: which yée terme a great pregnant idoll full of errors, blaſphemies, and abhominations. If the booke ſtand to be tried by Gods word, there is no doubt, but as all things done by men, euen the beſt, it ſhall be found vnperfect. He that will haue it to be no true worſhip of God, in which there be errors and ſpots, holdeth the hereſie of perfection, which is very foule and deteſtable: for it is as farre beyond our power, to bee perfect in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as to performe perfect obedience in the ſecond table of the lawe. And touching the booke of Common prayer, let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſider, it is not the queſtion betwéene vs, whether there be faults in it, great faults, or how many: but whether it be a great pregnant idol, full of hereſies, blaſphemies, and abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? I confeſſe that all men ought with vtter deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſhunne our worſhip, if it be ſuch as you accuſe it. But indéed your accuſation is falſe, your ſlaunders are foule and impudent. This ſhall appeare by following your words as they be ſet downe, where yée name thoſe blaſphemous abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, which yée charge the booke withall, in their ſeueral rankes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yée aſke vs where we find in the new Teſtament our Romiſh faſts, our Ember daies, Saints éeues, and Lent. I am indéed out of all doubt, and moſt aſſured, that if a man read o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, not onely the new Teſtament, but alſo both old and new, from the very beginning to the end, he ſhall neuer finde any allowance of Romiſh faſts. I ſay likewiſe of the Booke of Common prayer, that there be no Romiſh faſts in it: and that yée doo moſt iniuriouſly ſlaunder and belie vs in matching our Church in this point with the blaſphemous ſynagog of Rome. For that Antichriſtian Church, de rogating in all things from the Croſſe of Chriſt, hath vpon certaine daies, and at certaine times,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14667:12"/>
times, appointed an abſtinence from meates, placing therein the worſhip of God, remiſſion of ſinnes, and the merite of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. The Church of England dooth vtterly condemne this as the doctrine of Diuels, <hi>1. Timoth. 4</hi> pronouncing them enimies to the croſſe of Chriſt, which maintaine meritorious faſting. We teach that the kingdome of God is not meat and drinke, but righteouſnes and peace, and ioy in the Holy-ghoſt. <hi>Rom. 14.</hi> And that there is no holineſſe in eating or not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but an abſtinence whereby we may humble our ſelues, and be more feruent in prayer. The politike lawes of this land, which appoint that vpon certaine daies men ſhall not eat fleſh, doo it in reſpect of the common-wealth, as to maintaine Nauigation ſo much the better, by incouraging men to fiſh, and for the ſpare of the bréed of yoong cattle: appointing moreouer a penaltie for ſuch as ſhall take the daies to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued as meritorious Romiſh faſts. Therefore let all men héere at the firſt conſider, how ſophiſtically yée doo argue: that the Church of England dooth abſteine from fleſh vpon ember dayes, Saints Eues, and in Lent: therefore the Church of England dooth maintaine and obſerue Romiſh faſts. Thus dooth one cracke of your great ordinance, vaniſh onely into ſmoake. Then yée ſay, your idol feaſts, your Alhallowes, Candlemas, ſeuerall Lady dayes, Saints dayes, and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Churches vnto Saints. Héere alſo yée thunder out terror, as if the Church of England did worſhip idols, and celebrate feaſts in the honour of falſe gods: and yet all is but a ſtarke lie, and a wicked ſlander. And I would wiſh all men to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the boldneſſe and eloquence which yée haue in this vaine. For whereas the ſynagog of Antichriſt, denying the onelye mediation of our bleſſed Lord Ieſus, did ſet vp the Saints as mediators, did praye vnto them, worſhip them, celebrate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dayes in their honour, and dedicate churches vnto them: the Church of England for theſe and ſuch like abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hath ſeparate her ſelfe from them, teaching by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Scriptures, that there is one God, and one mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene<note place="margin">1.

Diuers Churches alſo among vs are called by the names of thoſe Saincts which they were dedicated vnto, but to ſay that we do therefore dedicate Churches vnto them, is very ridiculous.

Peters Church, or Paules Churchyard, it is but to diſtinguiſh them by the names by which they are commonly knowne and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Then follow our Comminations, Rogations, Purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Touching Comminations, they be a part of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Scripture which is to be read in the Church. Rogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I take to be the compaſſing in of the limits and bounds of Pariſhes, which is commaunded only to auoide contention and ſtrife that might growe, and there is nothing in the booke of Common Prayer touching theſe, that euer I could finde. Purifications are annexed, only to make vp your riming fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: for neither the booke, nor the doctrine of the Church of England, doth ſpeake of any Purification, but only in the bloud of the Lambe. There is a Thankſgiuing preſcribed for Women after Childbirth, but neyther for Iewiſh Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or Popiſh Superſtition, &amp; therefore not in ſuch ſort to be condemned. After comes in our Tithes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Offerings, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries. For the Tithes and Mortuaries, I do not finde them once named in the booke, the Offrings in déede are. But ye will ſay that is no great matter, ſéeing they be in our Church. That is true, but yet they are but for maintenance of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14667:13"/>
Miniſterie, &amp; not as a matter tyed of neceſſitie vnto a Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, as in the time of the Lawe: and if they were, the error could not be fundamentall. In the next place are brought in, our manner of viſiting the ſicke, and howſling them with the Sacrament, our Abſolution, blaſphemous Dirges, and Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Sermons ouer and for the dead. There is preſcribed a manner of viſiting the ſicke, and ſo is there in the leiturgies of ſome other Churches that profeſſe the Goſpell, but where haue ye ſéene it practiſed, or the practiſe vrged by thoſe that haue the gouernment of our Church, at their hands which are able and diligent Paſtors? Whereby your iniurious dealing may appeare, in charging all the aſſemblies as they generally ſtand in England with matters which the greater part do not practiſe, nor yet are required. For if the ſicke man be by the Miniſter of the word inſtructed, exhorted, comforted, and ſtrengthened in faith and repentance, yea euery way prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to depart ioyfully in the Lord, it is that which the booke aimeth at, neither is there any more required, although he vſe no preſcript forme ſet downe. By your phraſe of howſling with the Sacrament, ye would make the ſimple beleeue, that the Popiſh Howſling is retained among vs. This is but a falſe kind of packing, ſeeing our Church vtterly condemneth all the wicked blaſphemous corrupt doctrine of the Papiſts touching the Lords Supper: and alſo denyeth that a man is of neceſſitie to receiue this Sacrament at his death. If yes replie, that howſoeuer we teach, yet the booke implyeth a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, which appeareth by that it doth appoint a priuate Communion. I anſwer, that euen the booke doth denie it to be a matter of neceſſitie, and doth appoint it but to relieue the trouble which might ariſe in weake conſciences through the want thereof, for theſe be the words of the booke: The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſhall diligently from time to time, but ſpecially in the Plague time, exhort their Pariſhioners to the often receiuing in the Church, of the holy Communion of the bodie and bloud of our Sauiour Chriſt, which if they doo they ſhall haue no cauſe in their ſuddaine viſitation, to be diſquieted for lacke of the ſame. And if any ſicke perſon that would receiue this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14667:14"/>
Sacrament, hath any impediment that he can not, the Booke willeth the Miniſter to inſtruct him, that if he do truly repent him of his ſinnes, and ſtedfaſtly beléeue that Ieſus Chriſt hath ſuffered death vppon the Croſſe for him, and ſhead his bloud for his redemption, earneſtly remembring the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites he hath thereby, and giuing him hartie thanks therefore, he doth eate and drincke the Bodie and Bloud of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt profitably to his ſoules health, although he do not receiue the Sacrament with his mouth. How maliciouſly then do you charge the aſſemblies in England with howſling the ſicke with the Sacrament, when all the learned, faithfull, diligent Paſtors do, as the booke requireth, exhort thoſe that be of their flockes to the often receiuing of this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the publike aſſemblie, as the due place for publike ſeales, and the people by inſtruction being growen ſo ſtrong, that they do not in their ſickneſſe require it, and ſo in the moſt Congregations which are well taught, the thing is not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

That Purgatorie do we vtterly deny as a wicked inuention, we condemne prayer for the dead, and therfore, where ye tearme thoſe prayers which are read at burials blaſphemous Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ouer and for the dead, yee are more then impudent in lying. Funerall Sermons I finde not inioyned by the booke, nor commaunded by any Lawe. Ye adde further, our corrupt manner of adminiſtring the Sacraments, the Font, the Croſſe in Baptiſme, Baptiſme by women, Goſſippings, the blaſphemous Collects that we vſe vnto this Sacrament, Byſhopings, with all the hereticall Collects of the Booke, which, as ye ſay, is a wearines vnto ye to repeate, though not to vs both to tollerate and defend. When ye ſhewe ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why the Font is an abhomination, I ſhall knowe what to ſay. Touching the Croſſe, it muſt needes be confeſſed that it was blaſphemouſly and horribly abuſed in Poperie, they aſcribing vnto it power to driue out and expell Deuils, and worſhipping it with deuine honour. In my iudgement alſo,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14667:14"/>
the holy Church of God, within ſhort time after the bleſſed Apoſtles, and the reuerend godly Paſtors, did offend, in taking ouermuch libertie to ordeine Ceremonies Symbolicall, as that and ſuch like, yet no doubt very reuerend godly learned men, led by the example of thoſe holy Fathers of olde, haue iudged it lawfull for the Church to ordeine ſuch Ceremonies. Touching the Baptiſme by women, it is condemned both by the chéefe gouernours in our Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others, and is not practiſed vnleſſe it be among the popiſh and ſuperſticious ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ſort. By Goſſyppings, I ſuppoſe yée meane the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes at baptiſme, a thing vſed in the beſt reformed churches, and thought to be expedient: ſo that yée doo not heerein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the Church of England, but all Churches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Biſhoping of children is little practiſed, for vnleſſe the people require it by offering their children few Biſhops doo vrge them thervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, onely this excepted, that they be taught and inſtructed in the Catechiſme. The blaſphemous collects which we vſe in the Sacrament, and all the hereticall collects of the booke, doo trouble yée very ſore, and weary yée to repeat. But if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, I would ye were as weary of lying and ſlaundering, as ye ſhould be in ſéeking in all the collects of the booke, if yée were bound to ſéeke and to finde, I will not ſay ſome faultes, ſéeing all things framed by the beſt men, may haue imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and faults: but ſome blaſphemies or hereſies. If yée haue any regard at all what ye ſay, gather your wits toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſider what is blaſphemie, and what is hereſie, and then note the collect where it is, and what it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There ſhall neuer any man be able to prooue, that the Church of England dooth tollerate, much leſſe defend, either blaſphemie or hereſie.

All this is but your foule toong, which is no way ſo eloquent, as in rowling out ſlaunderous accuſation of blaſphemies, hereſies, and abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, with ſuch like.

thus in the church of England: that there is controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie about the Booke: and that one part dooth approoue all things in the ſame as good and alowable, or at leaſt as tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, the other condemne certaine things as corruptions, and ſuch as néede reformation. I would know how ye could abandon all the aſſemblyes? to this ye make a double anſwer, firſt, that vſing a part, they do homage to the whole. This is a fooliſh anſwer, void of all reaſon, for can we not praiſe the good things in a man, but we ſhall allowe his faultes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections? Your ſecond anſwer is this: Neither can the cunningeſt of ye all make the beſt part of it other then a péece of Swines fleſh, an abhomination to the Lord. Who could imagin that ſuch a frenſie might take hold of any, that in mad furie they ſhould not ſpare after a ſort to ſtrike at God, and to blaſpheme that which is moſt holy? for ye knowe right well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there is in the booke of Common Prayer, much of the ſacred Canonicall Scripture, there is the Lords prayer, the tenne Commaundements, with many other partes and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, there be the articles of the Chriſtian faith, are all theſe become Swines fleſh an abhomination to the Lorde? Let not ſimple men wonder that ye are bold to proclaime all the Miniſters of the Goſpell within this land, to be the marked ſeruants of Antichriſt, when ye dare preſume to ſet your ſtincking brand of pitch vpon the moſt holy things of God. Ye will héere cry out of iniurie, and ſay that ye eſtéeme all thoſe parcels of the ſacred Canonicall Scriptures, in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be holy and pure. What is it then which turneth them into Swines fleſh, and maketh them an abhomination to the Lord? is it becauſe they be bound together, and make one booke with the hereticall Collects? then take you héede, leaſt being in priſon, and fettred with heretikes, ye be turned alſo into Heretikes. If ye ſay, it is our abuſe which turneth ſo holy things into Swines fleſh, I aunſwere, that the abuſe of holy things is abhominable, but the things themſelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vndefiled: and ye muſt remember that we deale tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the partes of the booke, but abuſe is no part thereof. When ye ſay the beſt part thereof is no other then a péece of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14667:15"/>
Swines fleſh, it can not be tranſferred from the partes vnto the abuſes. If it were graunted vnto ye, which yet is to be denied as moſt fantaſticall, that all read prayer offred vp vnto God as a ſacrifice, is Idolatrie: neuertheleſſe your ſaying is wicked and blaſphemous, ſeeing that the reading is not any part of the booke, neither doth it peruert or defile the things themſelues which are read. Thus your firſt accuſation, that we worſhip the true God after a falſe manner, is with falſe ſclaunder, and furious outrage of ſpéech, crying out of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, blaſphemies, and abhominations, when as ye can ſhewe no one ground of the holy Religion and worſhip of God, which is not holden ſound and entire among vs, only ye rippe vp corruptions and ſpots in Ceremonies, orders, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which touch not the foundation, but are ſuch as men may erre in, and yet be Gods déere children, and true woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers.</p>

                     <hi>fantaſticall deuiſes of man, from the pure and ſincere worſhip of God, preſcribed in his Word. For ſeeing all fleſh is graſſe, and the wiſedome thereof fooliſhnes with God, it muſt needes follow, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earthly minded ſhould pleaſe themſelues in ſuch pretended religion, as agreeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with the diuine nature of God. It is needfull then in the worſhip of God, that we thus alwayes conſider with our ſelues, we haue to do with God himſelfe, and not with men, who is ſo farre differing from vs, that thoſe things which are moſt eaſy, and pleaſing vnto vs, is a weariſomnes and abhominable ſacrifice in his ſight: and although God dwelleth in the heauens in his diuinitie incomprehenſible, yet haue we a perfect rule, whereby we know what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his will, namely, his written word, for that we may be heere taught 1. That all hipocriſy in ſuch things as hee hath commaunded, be carefully auoyded. 2. That wee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt not to do any thing in his worſhip, whereof we haue not ſpeciall warrant from his word, of which ſort we take all manner of ſtinted prayers offered vp as a worſhipping of God, diſagreeing from the nature of God (which ſeeth in ſecret) and ſo agreeth with our fleſhly nature, that we can not pray as we ought, &amp; ſo we ſeeke to help our ſelues with ſuch a broken ſtaffe, wearying our ſelues with our owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes, without any promiſe to receyue bleſsing thereby. And therefore where you affirme, that a man may pray in ſpirit and truth, with ſighes, and grones, proceeding from faith, when prayer is read, that is not true, for if their ſighes came from faith, it would miniſter matter and prayer without a booke, yea no doubt, a troubled mind is the penne of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die writer; and to worſhip God in ſpirit, is, when the inward faith of the heart bringeth forth true inuocation, and it is</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:14667:17"/>
                     <hi>then in truth, when ſimply it agreeth with Gods word. But you would teach men in ſtead of powring forth their harts, to help themſelues vpon a booke, yea, to fetch their cauſe of ſorrowing &amp; ſighing from an other mans writing, euen in the time of their begging at Gods hand. We graunt, that prayers conceaued without faith, ar not acceptable, yet may the ſame be called ſpirituall, becauſe it is the gift of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, though not ſanctified in him that ſo hipocritically moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth with God. But what maketh this to our queſtion of ſtinted read prayers in Gods worſhip? But ſay you, to make read prayers only to ſerue for meditation, is falſe doctrine, wherein, me thinke you offer great iniurie, for we affyrmed that it had ſuch vſe as other of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s writings haue. But it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth you make little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience to ſlander vs, and heere you fall into an error your ſelfe, affirming, and going about to proue, that reading of prayers is not for meditation at all: the proofe you bring, is, that Chriſt ſaid not to his diſciples, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye meditate, ſay thus, <hi>Our Father,</hi> but when you pray, ſay thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where, beſide that you make no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your owne Liturgies, &amp; the holy word of God, which is not of any priuate interpretation: Beſides this I ſay you ſeeme to proue, that the Lords prayer, &amp; all other prayers in the Canonicall Scripture ſerue not at all for meditation. Well, you haue hereby made the matter apparant, that read prayers vpon a booke are as acceptable, as faithfull prayers conceiued by the ſpirit, &amp; vttered with vnderſtanding. You ſay that prayers read or conceiued, being void of faith, is but vaine babling: we ſay the ſame, but what of this forſooth? you cannot ſee by what cenſure it can be called Idolatry. If falſe worſhip cannot be called Idolatry, let the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commaundements be witneſſes, ſo that it is not our pennes, but the penne of Gods own finger that hath iudged all deuiſes of man, &amp; hipocriticall worſhip of Idolatry. And although all the breaches of the firſt Table were not Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, yet you know that to worſhip our own deuiſes, is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry. Is not prayer a ſpeciall part of the firſt Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and our Sauiour Chriſt comprehendeth all the foure firſt Commandements in this, that we loue God aboue all:</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:14667:17"/>
                     <hi>the tranſferring of any part whereof from God, muſt needs be idolatry. But ſay you, if we do thus &amp; hold withall, that no idolator can be ſaued, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſurely are all loſt, &amp;c. This is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey diuinity, if the Salt haue loſt his ſauour, what ſhould be ſeſoned therwith, we hold that no idolator ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be ſaued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true repentance, &amp; renouncing their ſinne ſo far as God ſhall ſhew it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea &amp; craue with <hi>Dauid</hi> for pardon for their hidden &amp; ſecret ſins. And doo you thinke any man liuing is void of idolatry, either inwardly or outwardly, ſo long as we liue, or that we can keep any one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? The Lord therfore giue vs repentance: for in ſome things we ſin all. Methinks this ſhould not be, <hi>M.

               <p>To condemne and ouerthrow read prayer, yée bring, as the ground or foundation of all your matter, this ſentence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>God is a ſpirit, and to be worſhipped in ſpirit. Iohn. 5.</hi> This ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indéed is cléere and ſtrong, to cut downe all carnall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as diſagréeing from the nature of God. And if any doo maintaine, that the very bodily action of reading prayer, is the worſhip of God, it may fitly be alledged againſt them. But to apply it in that manner which you doo againſt red praier, is friuolous, vnleſſe (as I ſay) yée could prooue, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray by the ſpirit of God, with ſighes and grones procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from faith, when the praier is read vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the booke, or vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after a preſcript forme. To this you reply with diuers arguments. The firſt is, that if the ſighes and grones were of faith, it would miniſter matter of praier without a booke. This reaſon by a connection is drawne from, and dependeth wholy vpon the force and effect of faith, to miniſter matter of prayer. It is to be framed thus. If the prayer with ſighes and grones were of faith, it would miniſter matter without a booke: but the matter of their prayer, with ſighes and grones, is not miniſtred without a booke, therefore it is not of faith. to make this argument ſtrong and ſufficient from the connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faith, and the liuely efficacie thereof to vtter prayer, yée
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14667:18"/>
muſt adde two things, the one, that faith is perfect vnto this efficacie, to miniſter matter of praier, and néedeth no helpe. The other, that the effect and power of faith, to miniſter mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of prayer, cannot ſtand nor be ioyned with any outward helpes. Vnleſſe I ſay yée adde theſe two, with the cupling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether faith and the effect, which are both of them hereticall, there can be no neceſſarie conſequence. To make it yet more manifeſt, let it be drawne into an other forme of ſyllogyſme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus. That which hath power and efficacie of it ſelfe to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter matter of prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> néede not any outward helpe, nor cannot touching the vtterance of matter in prayer, ſtand with any outward helpe: But faith hath force and efficacie in it ſelfe to miniſter matter of prayer: Therefore faith néeds not the helpe of a booke, nor cannot ſtand with any outward helpe, touching the vtterance of matter in prayer: And ſo conſequently, the ſighes and grones in prayer red, cannot be of faith. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence ſhall neuer be brought in, vnleſſe yée frame your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument after that ſort. So that both theſe fantaſticall errors be included in your ſpéech, the one, that faith touching the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie to miniſter matter of praier is ſo abſolutely perfect, that it néedeth no outward helpe, the other, that it cannot touching prayer ſtand with any outward helpe. I doo acknowledge that there be no ſighes nor grones, nor any praiers that can be regarded of God, but ſuch as come from faith. I doo alſo hold, that faith is not in any, without ſome efficacie and power to vtter ſome matter of praier. But now we muſt conſider the degrées thereof: for doubtleſſe if there were in men a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of knowledge, of faith, and of quickneſſe, there ſhould néed no outward helpe: but the beſt come farre ſhort of that. Such as approche néereſt there vnto, néed ſo much the leſſe any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward helpe. But the moſt are ignorant, weake, ſhort of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, dull and ſlow, and néed all helpes to ſtirre them vp, and to direct them, euen as children, that are to be ſtayed vp and led by the hand. Praier indéed is a ſpirituall worke, procéeding from faith, which is a ſpirituall gift, but yet it doth ſtand with outward meanes and helpes. The Holy-ghoſt alone dooth worke faith in man, but yet it commeth by hearing, <hi>Rom. 10,</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:14667:18"/>
Faith bringeth foorth prayer, but we muſt conſider, that as the ſame faith commeth by hearing, and is grounded vpon the word, ſo is it cheriſhed, ſupported, increaſed, continued, and quickened in efficacie, and made more forcible vnto euery good worke by thoſe helps of outward meanes. For further confirmation ye adde, yea no doubt, a troubled minde is the penne of a ready writer. Let it ſtand in forme of ſyllogiſme thus. That which is the pen of a ready writer, néedeth not the helpe of a booke. But a troubled minde is the pen of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy writer: therefore it néedeth not the helpe of a Booke. The propoſition is true, if by the pen of a ready writer yée vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand an abſolute perfection of knowledge, chéerefulneſſe, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, memorie and vtterance. But that was not in <hi>Moſes, Daniel, Paul,</hi> or any other. Therefore héere againe yée runne vpon the rocke of an hereticall opinion of perfection. Your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, where yée ſay: no doubt, a troubled minde is the pen of a ready writer, is vtterly falſe, and your bold affirmation without ſcripture is not enough, ſéeing there be many ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and confuſed in the trouble of their minde, and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ignorance, that they cannot pray, nor know not what to vtter: which, when they haue inſtruction and conſolation miniſtred vnto them by ſome godly man, or if that chéefe help faile, by reading vpon a booke, poure foorth teares and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
               <p>Your next reaſon is in many words, which yet I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate. <q>To worſhip God (<hi>ſay you</hi>) in ſpirite, is when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward faith of the heart bringeth foorth true inuocation: and it is then in truth, when it ſimply agreeth with Gods word. But you would teach men in ſteed of powring foorth theyr hearts, to helpe themſelues vpon a booke, yea to fetch the cauſe of their ſighing and ſorrowing from an other mans writing, euen in the time of their begging at Gods hand.</q> I will alſo drawe it into a ſyllogiſme, to the end it may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be iudged of. None worſhip God in ſpirite, but they which from the inward faith of the heart bring foorth true inuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is, ſuch as ſimply agréeth with the word of God. But all ſuch as read vpon the booke the prayer which they pray,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14667:19"/>
fetch the cauſe of their ſorrowing from an other mans wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the time that they pray, and doo not from the inward faith of the heart, bring foorth true inuocation. Therfore none that reade their praier vpon the booke, doo worſhip God in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The propoſition I aſſent vnto as ſound and good: for it is no true inuocation except it agrée with Gods word. It is not to worſhip in ſpirit, vnleſſe it procéed from faith out of the heart. But your aſſumption, which is, that all that reade the praier which they pray, doo not from the inward faith of the heart, bring foorth true inuocation, I cannot allowe, ſéeing yée bring nothing for proofe thereof, but that which is moſt friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. For whereas yée ſay in the firſt part of your confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we would haue men in ſtéed of powring foorth theyr hearts, to helpe themſelues vpon a booke, yée ſpeake vntruly and fooliſhly.

               <p>The next part of your confirmation, is euen to as great purpoſe, when yée ſay, <q>We would haue men fetch the cauſe of their ſighing and ſorrowing, from an other mans writing, euen in the time of their begging at Gods hand.</q> For how fondly doo yée make that to be the cauſe, which dooth but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the cauſe? for the cauſe of all ſighing and ſorrowing, is the ſinne and miſerie which is within vs: which we may the better behold and expreſſe by inſtruction. I haue gréeuous ſinne, and wrath belonging therevnto, which I doo partlye know, and can make ſome moane therein, and praye: I come into the publike aſſembly, where I heare the miniſter preach the word, which dooth more fully laye open and diſplay my ſinne and miſery: I am héereby driuen into déeper ſighing and ſorrowing, with vehement praier in my heart vnto God: ſhall it be ſaide, that I doo now fetch the cauſe of my ſorrowing from an other mans ſpéech in the time of my begging at Gods hands? If not, then why ſhould I be ſaid to fetch the cauſe from the booke, which alſo dooth inſtruct me? the like may be ſaid, when the congregation dooth pray with their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor: they fetch not the cauſe of their ſighing from him: but are ſtirred vp by him. Your next words ſtand thus. <q>The reaſons
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14667:19"/>
why we diſalow of read prayers, in ſteed of ſpiritual prayers, that though they may be read for meditation, as any other mens writs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet is it Idolatrie, to offer vp to God ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſacrifices, either priuately, or in the publike aſſemblies.</q> Yée are very angrie, that I termed your reaſons, by which yée oppoſe read praier vnto ſpirituall praier, ſpirituall fantaſies. But take you héed that they grow not to be worſe. Yée are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo gréeued, that I call them your ſtuffe, but how good ſtuffe it is, let the pure word try. I ſaid it is falſe doctrine to make read prayer ſerue only for meditation. My proofe was this, that Chriſt ſaith not, when ye meditate, but when ye pray, ſay thus, <hi>Our Father which art in heauen:</hi> and héere ye fling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as if ye had Béez. For firſt ye exclaime that I make ſmal conſcience to ſclaunder ye, becauſe I ſaid ye make read prayer ſerue only for meditation, which is falſe doctrine. Meditation (as I take it) comprehendeth all that is done in ſtudying and muſing when one readeth, the praying is another. If ye can ſhew a third vſe when one readeth prayer, I will confeſſe an error, otherwiſe, though ye haue not expreſſed the word only, yet ye haue in effect vttered ſo much, when ye ſay read prayer is not to be prayed. Secondly, ye charge me to deny that read prayer ſerueth for meditation at all, which is in deede falſe doctrine: becauſe I ſaid Chriſt ſaith not when ye meditate, but when ye pray ſay thus, <hi>Our Father which art &amp;c.</hi> Do I not ſay truly that Chriſt ſaith not when ye meditate, but when yée pray, ſay thus, <hi>Our Father which art &amp;c.</hi> How can you then but like Spiders ſucke that poyſon from thence? Thirdly, ye accuſe me, that I make no difference betwéene our owne Leiturgies and the Canonicall Scripture, which is a moſt friuolous cauill, ſéeing our queſtion is about reading of prayer, whether it be Canonicall Scripture, or framed from thence according to the rules of godly prayer. Thus haue ye anſwered nothing at all vnto that commaundement which I alleaged giuen by our Sauiour, to vſe that preſcript forme of prayer, but only by ſhift and cauill. Then ye goe about to proue that euery ſinne againſt the firſt Table of the Lawe is Idolatry, but with no ſhewe of reaſon. And heere ye ſcoffe becauſe I ſayd, if euery ſinne that is againſt the firſt Table
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14667:20"/>
be Idolatry, who ſhall be ſaued? and ye demaund who is frée from Idolatry? an abſurd ſpéech: for the Scripture doth not call the godly either murtherers, théeues, idolaters, or ſuch like. I thought we had not reaſoned about the reliques of ſin which remaine in the beſt ſo long as they liue héere, but of ſuch groſſe idolatry as a Church is to be condemned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken which is defiled therewith. But ſéeing ye confeſſe that all men be idolaters, that is, touching the remnants of ſinne, it muſt néedes followe that there is no Church frée from all ſpottes, for if all the partes and members be defyled, the whole can not be cleane. This doth ouerthrowe all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which yée bring to condemne the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which haue no force vnleſſe yée will maintaine a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: for if a Church and euery member in it can not but of neceſſitie be ſpotted and defyled with ſome remnants of idolatrie, euen by your owne confeſſion: then can ye not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus, this is a fault, it is idolatrie, therefore this or that aſſemblie which is ſpotted is no true Church, but to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken. But ye muſt ſtand to prooue that the idolatrie is ſo groſſe, that it deſtroyeth the faith, ouerthroweth Gods true worſhip, and ſo deſtroyeth the verie life &amp; béeing of a Church. Thus much about your preface, now follow your argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</p>

               <p>In my firſt anſwere I did deale only with the aſſumption or ſecond part of this Argument, affirming that I could not ſée how it can be proued, and ſhewing ſundry abſurdities that would follow; as namely, that a prayer of the Canonicall Scripture being read when one prayeth, ſhould become apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha, &amp;c. But you replyed that thoſe abſurdities grow from my miſtaking your words, and I ſawe it was ſo, for our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion being about the reading of prayer, and not about the matter it ſelfe, I tooke it, that although yee hold the Lords prayer, and other prayers in the holy Scripture to be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall in themſelues, yet being read to become apocrypha, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye ſay all read prayer is apocrypha, and did not expreſſe it with this reſtraint, all read prayer framed by men, is apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14667:20"/>
I muſt now take the Argument as you ſay your meaning is, and deale with both the parts thereof. Firſt then touching the propoſition, no apocrypha is to be brought into the publike aſſemblies, what can be more falſe? Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha is oppoſed vnto Canonicall, if nothing may be brought into the Church but the Canonicall Scriptures, then the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and prayers of the paſtors and teachers are to be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. I knowe your meaning is not at all to exclude theſe, although your words (taking apocrypha as it is in vſe among vs) do in déede ſhut them foorth, and not only them, but any paraphraſe vpon the Scripture, as the Pſalmes in Metre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now to your aſſumption, which ſaith, all read prayer is apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha: firſt, it is falſe touching the Pſalmes and the Lords prayer, which be Canonicall when they be prayed. Then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſée no fitneſſe in applying the name apocrypha vnto our ſpéech to God, though it be vſed for that which is not his vndoubted word to vs. For by what name oppoſite to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha, will ye call thoſe prayers which ye do allow? ye will not call them Canonicall, this Argument therfore is falſe and friuolous.</p>

               <p>To this I anſwer at the firſt, that it is great audacitie to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that there is no warrant of the word for read prayer, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there be ſundry teſtimonies to warrant the ſame, vnleſſe ye will make a difference betwéene that which a man readeth vpon the booke, &amp; that which he hath learned out of the booke. Further I ſaid, I do not remember that euer I haue read in the holy Scriptures, that God commandeth the prayer ſhall be read vpon the booke: for he commendeth this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in all his people, that they ſhould throughly learne to vnderſtand, not only the matters, but alſo the ſentences and phraſes, which his ſpirit taught his holy Prophets and ſeruants to vtter in their prayers, and that this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why there be ſo many prayers preſcribed in the booke
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14667:21"/>
of the Pſalmes, and in other bookes of the Scriptures: that whatſoeuer thing befall a man, wherein he is in the feruent affection of his heart to pray vnto the Lord, if he haue in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie the ſpéeches which holy men in ſuch diſtreſſe vttered, it is a great help vnto him, if not, he may help his memory with a booke. To this you reply, that touching the vſe of ſentences and phraſes of ſcripture, you could eaſily conſent, but that ye perceiue I would not agrée with ye in certaine points, the firſt, that this is required only at the hands of Gods children, with promiſe to be heard and accepted. I wonder with what eyes ye can ſée that I would not agrée with ye in this thing, I put ye out of doubt, I hold aſſuredly, that none haue promiſe to be heard and accepted but Gods children, though they vſe neuer ſo much the ſentences of Scripture in their prayers. The firſt hinderance of your conſent is remoued. The ſecond is, that ye ſée I would not agrée with ye, that the ſame ſpirit doth now teach Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pray, which taught the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets &amp; holy men in other ages. I profeſſe vnto ye, that I hold it a wicked opinion, to deny that the ſame ſpirit doth nowe teach Gods children to pray, which taught the Prophets, &amp;c. and ſo the ſecond let is remoued. In déede héere you and I diſſent, that I hold, that as our faith is wrought by the word of God, ſo is it nouriſhed and quickned vnto prayer, and euery good work by the ſame, and that the holy Ghoſt hath not only taught matters by the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, but alſo ſpéeches and phraſes ſit for to vtter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. And you hold that becauſe the ſame ſpirit now teacheth to pray, which taught the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets &amp; Apoſtles that either we may not, or we néede not vſe their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpéeches. The third ſtop remaineth, which is, that I take it, God ſhould be delighted with words and ſentences. You greatly miſtake it and do but cauill: for I ſhewed my minde, not that God would regard words &amp; ſentences, but we ſhould be holpen and comforted by them. Thus the third and laſt hinderance is alſo remoued, and now you may conſent that in our prayers we may vſe the preſcript formes, ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and phraſes of the word of God. To my next wordes, where I ſayd, the reaſon why there be ſo many prayers
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14667:21"/>
preſcribed in the booke of the Pſalmes, is: that whatſoeuer diſtreſſe befall a man, &amp;c. you reply: yée thinke I halt greatly, that our queſtion being about Idolatrous leiturgies, I ſéeke to ſhrowd my ſelfe vnder the vſe of Canonicall ſcripture. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed this would be a learned queſtion, whether idolatrous lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies be idolatrie? or whether it be not idolatry to pray an idolatrous praier? who would looke for ſo childiſh a ſhift? you know our queſtion is about the reading of a praier when one prayeth? And if it be not idolatry to vſe the praiers of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, euen in their preſcript forme, then all read praier offred to God as a ſacrifice, is not idolatrie. I reaſon thus: it is not idolatry to pray the Lords praier, or any other preſcript forme deliuered in the Canonicall ſcriptures: therefore it is no ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to vſe a preſcript forme of praier, which is framed after the rules of true praier: as to aſke of God alone, through the onely mediation of his ſonne, and for no matters, but ſuch as he hath promiſed to giue: Yée ſay it is not true doctrine, that thoſe Pſalmes and Scriptures were written that we ſhould vſe in our praiers the words there ſet downe. Your reaſon is becauſe there be other vſes. I doo confeſſe there be other vſes, but that might yet be a ſpeciall reaſon, why there be ſo many praiers preſcribed. Then yée ſay yée do not diſalow the ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to the word of God, but that we might not affect ſo much the phraſes of ſpéech, as the true féeling of our wants, He that hath not the féeling of his wants in praier, but affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth phraſes, is but an hypocrite. But ye are in a vaine opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if ye thinke the vſe of the phraſes and ſentences of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being fitly applied, is any hinderance either to the féeling or opening our wants, becauſe where ſkill or memorie faileth I would haue them vſe the helpe of a booke. I am, you feare, papiſtically affected vnto words and ſentences. I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewed, that this is not to affect the words and ſentences, but the inſtruction, the ſupport and quickning which our faith receiueth by thoſe words &amp; ſentences. And this doctrine is not as you charge it, diſagréeing from the counſell of the Holy ghoſt, which willeth vs to continue in praier, to ſtriue in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, nor contrarie to <hi>Dauid,</hi> which ſaid, <hi>O my ſoule, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> nor to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14667:22"/>
                  <hi>Paul,</hi> who teacheth that the ſpirit helpeth our infirmities, and maketh requeſt for vs. But your doctrine, which ſaith, we muſt continue in prayer, therfore we may not vſe ſuch helps: the ſpirit dooth helpe our infirmities, and maketh requeſt for vs, therefore we may not be holpen by the praiers, or by the words of the holy ſcripture, is phantaſticall, for the Holy ghoſt doth helpe our infirmities, and teach vs to pray, by the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word. You thinke it were hypocriticall worſhipping of God, to take helpe by a booke, when we know not what to aſke. If a man know not what to aſke, he ſhall be able to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand little by the booke. But a man may know what he ſhould aſke, and yet not ſo well able to expreſſe the ſame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out helpe, both for memory and feruencie. Stinted praiers (yée ſay) are as Cuſhions for idle papiſts, hypocrites, and Atheiſts. I graunt that ſuch people doo abuſe all the beſt things, ſhall the godly therefore be debarred from the vſe? I doo teach, that whether a man of himſelfe pray without a booke, or vpon a booke, if he pray not in ſpirit with faith, he dooth but offer the ſacrifice of fooles, his praier is abhominable. Therfore it is but your lauiſh ſpéech, when ye ſay I giue libertie to the lame ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: on the contrary, if a man pray in faith vpon a booke, or without a booke, it is true praier, and ſuch as God heareth. God will haue no ſtrange fire put vpon his Altar, ſay you. I graunt it is ſo: but praiers framed by the rules of ſcripture, and offered vp in faith, are not ſtrange fire. Yée wiſh all men to take héed of this craftie doctrine, and I wiſh all men not to be to haſtie in receiuing new phantaſticall opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer vnto thoſe two Pſalmes, which I noted, were giuen as a preſcript forme of praier to be vſed of the Church, and the forme of bleſſing preſcribed to the Préeſts to bleſſe the people withall, <hi>Num. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> is more then friuolous. For touching the firſt, which is 92<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> appointed for the Sabaoth, yée graunt it was at their méeting to magnifie the praiſes of God, &amp; many other Pſalmes. But yée demaund, what this maketh for ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted leiturgies, papiſticall and erronious, impoſed, &amp;c. I ſay, it maketh nothing at all for that which is papiſticall and erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. But it prooueth that all read praier is not idolatrie, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14667:22"/>
that it is no ſtinting of the ſpirit, to vſe a preſcript forme of praier. Theſe fantaſies of yours are firſt confuted thereby. Then next I argue thus. If I may vſe a whole praier of the ſcripture, and no idolatrie, then a praier that is compoſed by the rules of the ſcriptures may be vſed, and no idolatrie. You deny, that the argument drawne from the vſe of the Pſalmes dooth follow, becauſe praiers compoſed by men, are not equall to the Canonicall ſcripture: and ſo ſhut out all praiers, if yée marke well what yée ſay, that are framed by the Preacher, For let them be holy and good, yet yée may not ſet them as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with the Canonicall ſcriptures. Againe yée deny the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, by affirming, that ſinging of Pſalmes was no part of praier, but onely for inſtruction and meditation: ye take vpon ye to prooue this a little after, and when I come to that, ye ſhall haue anſwer. The <hi>Pſalm. 102.</hi> ye ſay was not a praier of the Church, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>O Lord heare my prayer,</hi> and not, <hi>O Lord heare our prayer:</hi> a poore ſhift, when vſually the church ſpeaketh of her ſelfe in the ſingular number. Touching the bleſſing: ye ſay, that forme of words was not to tie them to vſe thoſe words, but after that manner, which is manifeſtly falſe.</p>
               <p>Touching the orders of ſingers appointed by <hi>Dauid,</hi> I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it to no ſuch end, as you ſéeme to drawe it vnto. But that in ſinging the Pſalmes, they did read them vpon the booke. Héer now ye do not onely deny, that ſinging of pſalmes was any part of praier, but alſo ye will prooue it by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and to the <hi>Collofs.</hi> where he exhorteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake vnto themſelues in pſalmes &amp; hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs. It is a foule audacitie, contrary to the manifeſt word of truth, to affirme that the Pſalmes were not ſunge to God, ſéeing that not onely the ſpeeches be directed in a multitude of places vnto him: but alſo the Holy-ghoſt doth call vpon men in this wiſe. Sing vnto God, ſing a new ſong vnto him, ſing praiſes vnto the Lorde. But beſide this you go further, for in both places by you cited, ye leaue out the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the ſentence, which is, that they ſhould ſing vnto the Lorde with grace in their hearts. Let the reader peruſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14667:23"/>
the places, and iudge what kinde of tricke this is. It is moſt cléere, that they did reade the Pſalmes vpon the booke when they did ſing them. It is alſo out of controuerſie, that they did ſing them to the Lord, vnleſſe we will deny the flat word of the Holy-ghoſt, and alſo affirme, that albeit the ſpéech be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to God, yet they did not in ſinging ſpeake vnto him. It cannot be denied, but that many of the Pſalmes be full of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. Alſo praiſe is a part of prayer, and a ſpirituall ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: this was offered vp to God, in reading vpon the booke, for it is ſaide. Sing praiſes to the Lorde: therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that read prayer hath warrant by the word, and the reading dooth not make it idolatrie, or contrarie to ſpirituall praier. Héere yée complaine againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this argument dooth not follow, becauſe praiers compoſed by men, are not to be matched with the Canonicall ſcriptures. I haue anſwered this poore ſtale ſhift already<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the praiers compoſed by men are no further lawfull, then they be framed by the rules of Gods word for prayer.</p>
               <p>Thus haue I not, as you charge me, laid aſide the queſtion to make new queſtions: but haue diſprooued that your olde queſtion, by ſhewing, that reading the praier which is godly, dooth not make it contrary vnto ſpirituall praier, nor idolatry.</p>

               <p>To the aſſumption of this argument, I anſwered at the firſt which I particularly rehearſed, how can yée then with any ſhew of truth, ſay my words import a deniall of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents, aſſumption and all. My words are theſe: The third argument ſaith, that the forme of praier is a bondage and breaking our libertie with, &amp;c. The prooues which I bring do onely ouerthrow the aſſumption, for I did and doo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the propoſition, which you ſay my words import a deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of. I would wiſh yée to vſe more ſimplicitie, I ſay it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlye and néere vnto blaſphemy, to affirme that preſcript
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14667:23"/>
forme of prayer, is a tradition, bringing our libertie into bondage, and a changing the worke of the ſpirit into an idoll. My reaſon was and is, that the Lord by <hi>Moyſes</hi> preſcribed a forme of bleſſing which the Préeſts ſhould vſe <hi>Nomb. 6.</hi> The Prophets, as in the Pſalmes, preſcribed many formes of prayſes and prayers, to be vſed of the Church. Our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt preſcribed a forme, and ſayd, when yée pray ſay <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> If the verie reading, or vſing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript forme commaunded, were a bondage, breaking Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian libertie, or a changing the worke of the Spirit into an idoll, then the Lord God, <hi>Moyſes,</hi> the Prophets, and our Sauiour Chriſt, are charged with a great fault. Your reply is with ſome roughneſſe of ſpéech, which I omitte, becauſe it is but your faſhion. But for proofe, that read prayer is mans inuention, and thruſt vpon the Church by conſtraint, ye ſay England knoweth by wofull experience. There hath béene I graunt in the Church of England variance about ſome matters to be read, which are commaunded in the Leitur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, but not about the commaunding a preſcript forme of prayer to be vſed: for therein our Church doth agrée with all godly Churches, that a preſcript forme of publike prayers is conuenient, yea, the reformed Churches haue and do practiſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>Héere therefore I would wiſhe the Reader to obſerue, that you <hi>Browniſts,</hi> doe not only condemne the Church of England, but all the reformed Churches whatſoeuer, and can be none other but méere <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> For héere in this your third argument ye affirme, that preſcript forme of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er commaunded, is the changing the worke of the ſpirit into an idoll, a tradition breaking Chriſtian libertie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt deteſtable. In your fift Argument, ye ſay, it is a dead letter which doth quench the ſpirit. But all reformed Churches doo by commaundement receyue and vſe preſcript forme of prayers. Conſider then what ſentence yee haue giuen againſt all the viſible Churches of our time, and of former ages, for it will come to paſſe, that as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> tooke themſelues to be the only true Church in earth, ſo muſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14667:24"/>
you <hi>Browniſts</hi> of neceſſitie, if your ſpéeches be weighed, ſéeing all Churches haue and doo things which you affirme to be moſt deteſtable idolatry: but let the matter come into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be debated among the Churches, and you will be found Anabaptiſts for imagining ſuch a Chriſtian libertie and fréedome in the Church, that nothing is to be receyued which is impoſed by commaundement. Then ye ſay, that it breaketh our libertie, S. Paul proueth moſt plainely to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathians</hi> and <hi>Coloſsians.</hi> I pray ye then that we may ſée ſuch plaine proofe, which as yet none but your ſelues can eſpy: note the ſentences that will prooue the matter. You take it, there is no warrant to ſet foorth any preſcript forme of prayer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt hath preſcribed a forme. Ye thinke I might more ſafely reaſon thus, Chriſt hath preſcribed a forme of prayer, therefore neyther Pope, Byſhop, or Prelate, ought to impoſe any other vpon Gods children, vntill they can ſhewe ſome warrant from Gods word ſo to do. I am fully of your minde, that none ought to impoſe any other forme, vntill they can ſhewe warrant from Gods word. But nowe marke how the Argument will followe: <hi>Moyſes,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and our Lord Ieſus gaue preſcript formes of prayer and prayſing God, to be vſed by the Church: therefore the reading of a preſcript forme of prayer when one prayeth or offreth vp the ſacrifice of prayſe to God, doth not change the worke of the Spirit into an idoll, nor is not a breaking Chriſtian libertie, nor idolatrie, for the holie Scripture is farre from appointing any idolatrous thing. Then I reaſon further, that if the Prophets and our Sauiour gaue preſcript formes to be vſed, the Church may take order to ſée them v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. And from hence it doth followe, that the Church may impoſe preſcript forme of godlie prayers, which are framed aright.</p>
               <p>If any thinke this a ſtrange conſequence, let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the Lords prayer in generall conteyneth in it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter touching the ſubſtance and ſumme of all prayers which haue béene made, or are to be made aright. The Pſalmes, and other prayers in the Scriptures, doo expreſſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14667:24"/>
with ſundrie ſentences, and phraſes, moſt fitte to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſame.</p>
               <p>Nowe the Church hath power and authoritie, not onely to expound theſe prayers, but alſo to applye them vnto eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſeuerall vſe and neceſſitye. This I adde withall, that the Church hath no authoritye to bring in any one thing in prayer, which is not conteyned in thoſe prayers of Gods word: but when the prayers be compoſed and framed of nothing but the doctrine of the Scriptures, and after the rules of true prayer, nothing is brought in which God hath not commaunded. Lay aſide therefore all your ſhiftes tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Apocrypha, mens writings, and inequalitie with Canonicall Scriptures, and bring your Arguments againſt the preſcript forme and the reading, to prooue that they make a prayer holie in it ſelfe, to become abhominable, and contrarie vnto ſpirituall prayer.</p>
               <p>That yee ſay, our Sauiour neuer vſed the words of the Lords prayer, when he prayed, neyther commaunded his Diſciples to ſay ouer theſe words, neyther doo we reade that the Apoſtles did euer vſe, or enforced others to vſe certayne words, &amp;c. ye ſpeake vntruly, for the Diſciples deſired him to teach them to pray as <hi>Iohn</hi> taught his diſciples to pray, and he commaundeth, when yée pray, ſay thus: <hi>Our Father which art in heauen, hallowed be thy name &amp;c. Luke 11.</hi> and <hi>S. Mathew</hi> an Apoſtle, with <hi>S. Luke</hi> the Euangeliſt, hath deliuered the ſame to the whole Church, if we reade not any where that they did vſe the Lords prayer, or commaunded others to vſe it? Will ye reaſon thus, we do not reade that the Apoſtles, or the Church in their time, did baptize Infants, therefore Infants were not baptized? or will ye reaſon thus, we neuer read that the Apoſtles did pray eyther before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they preached, therefore they did not? your argument is the very ſame with theſe two former, yet from hence ye will néeds conclude, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we will impoſe vpon whole Churches cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words, euen our own words, ſtinting the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p>I haue alreadie ſhewed, that the Church hath not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to bring any forme of prayer into the aſſemblies, but
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14667:25"/>
ſuch as is agréeable to the rules appointed for prayer by the word of God. And where ye call it a ſtinting of the Spirit, I aunſwere, that the Spirit of God is not ſtinted, but ſome men are furthered by preſcript formes, their infirmities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſuch an eye, as I haue ſhewed before.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Theſe thrée I ioyned together as hauing no waight. Ye ſay I anſwere by playne contradiction, without Scripture, or proofe. In déede you quote Scripture to prooue thoſe things which are not doubted of, as, that true prayer muſt be of faith, vttered with hart: that to worſhip God after an other manner then he hath taught, is idolatrie: that we muſt ſtriue in prayer with continuance. But what ſcripture do ye bring to prooue that it is preſumptuous ignorance to vſe the help of a booke, that thoſe which reade vpon a booke come not with faith and contrite hearts, &amp;c. but ſtand reading a dead letter which quencheth the Spirit, and that a booke is no helpe for continuance in prayer, what Scripture I ſay, bring yee to prooue any of theſe? is not my bare denyall as good as your bare affirmation, and in this farre better that I haue before proued the vſe of reading by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God. <hi>Dauid</hi> (ſay you) would prayſe the Lord with hart and doyce, therefore not vpon a booke. <hi>S. Paule</hi> would pray with the ſpirit, and with vnderſtanding, therefore not vpon a booke. <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Paule</hi> had not ſo much néed of the booke as other men. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they will other to ſing prayſes to God, as in Pſalmes, &amp; Himnes,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14667:25"/>
and ſpirituall ſongs, did they not ſend them to the booke, or to the preſcript formes, wherein others might praiſe God toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, although they binde not men alwaies to the booke. Then yée adde a reaſon, why praier read, cannot be true praier: which is, that in reading we fetch the matter from the booke which mooueth the heart. In true praier we fetch the matter from the heart, which cauſeth the mouth to ſpeake: as, I beléeued, and therefore I ſpake. This is a moſt ridiculous vanitie, for tell me this, when we bring foorth in true praier, matter from the heart which cauſeth the mouth to ſpeake, hath not the heart béene firſt mooued with the word of faith? why may not the heart be mooued againe with hearing or reading the word, and ſo vtter true praier? the heart is moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued when one heareth the praier of the miniſter, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſendeth forth praiers together with him. Do ye imagine that the heart cannot both be mooued and pray at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant? Is it not poſſible for one to pray in ſinging a Pſalme?</p>

               </q>
               <p>To this I anſwered, approouing the propoſition, and in the aſſumption I did diſtinguiſh of matters to be praied for, as that there be things neceſſarie to be praied for at all times, and of all men: of theſe a preſcript forme may be vſed at all méetings of the Church. There be matters not at all times néedfull to be praied for: touching theſe, there can be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript forme to be vſed continually, yea ſome things fall out ſo rare, that it were hard: for, as it is a fault to omit that which néedeth continually and of all men to be praied for: ſo is it a groſe babling to pray for things whereof there is no néed. And if yée obſerue the preſcript praiers of all Churches, yée ſhall find the regard of theſe two things, that nothing neceſſary be omitted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> no praier be for ſuch things as fall out ſildome, but they are limited to the time. And further, that which falleth out beſide the preſcript formes, the miniſters of the word are to ſupply. And in the Church of England, the Preachers are not limitted touching the matters of their praiers. But if I
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14667:26"/>
meane by the things which be neceſſary to be prayed for at all times, the Sacraments or any ſuch thinges as Chriſt hath ſet foorth in his word, wee ſhould thinke our Sauiour Chriſt, you ſay, to haue forgotten himſelfe, that when he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them to preach and baptize, that he did not preſcribe ſome forme of wordes for their praiers, before their doctrine and Sacraments.</p>
               <p>To this I aunſwer, I doo not holde that for the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the worde and Sacramentes, it is of neceſſitie there ſhould bee a forme of praier preſcribed: for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter may conceiue the prayers at the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, as well as at the preaching of the worde. But preſcript forme, is for conueniencie. Neither am I of the minde, that one preciſe forme is of neceſſitie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yée reaſon verye fondlye, in ſaying wee might thinke our Sauiour forgat himſelfe, that he did not preſcribe a forme of wordes for their prayers, before their doctrine and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes. Your nexte wordes, that then I muſt further ſaye, that all things neceſſarye in the worſhip of GOD, are not conteined in the Canonicall Scriptures, and ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye waye vpholde the Papiſts, are euen as farre wide. For all things neceſſarye and conuenient in Gods worſhippe bee conteined in the Canonicall Scriptures. But are you ignorant of this, that there be many thinges conteyned in the Scriptures, which are not in particular expreſſed, but to bee gathered from the generall groundes and rules of doctrine. What if one ſhould obiect vnto yée, there is no commaundement nor example of the Apoſtles in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for anye prayer to bee made at the Preaching of the worde, and adminiſtration of Sacraments. Therefore it is not conteined in the Scriptures, that there ſhould bee anye, and ſo a thing not neceſſarye. Would yée not flie to this, that although it bee not expreſſed by anye commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that there ſhould bee ſuch prayers, yet is it to bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the doctrine conteined in the Scriptures? How groſſe are yée then, in ſaying that this dooth vpholde the Papiſts?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:14667:26"/>But yée ſaye, it were well I ſet downe what it is, that may bee fitte at all times, and for all perſons to craue? I maruaile anye ſhould be ſo babling, as to propound ſuch a matter, making doubt. For can yée be ignorant, that going through the whole Lords praier, and opening the particulars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is no one petition, but almoſt all branches of it are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to bee craued at all publike méetings and of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>When will there bee a time, and an aſſemblie, in which it ſhall not bee fitte for all to make ſupplication, that the name of the Lorde may bee ſanctified: that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the giftes and graces of the Holy-ghoſt, to imbrace the true light of the Goſpell, to increaſe in knowlege, faith, and repentance: to praye for Princes, for the whole Church, and for the ouerthrowe of Chriſtes enimies? to haue grace to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and to walke worthy of the Goſpell. To craue all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites for our neceſſary ſuſtentation, and the pardon of our ſinnes, with deliuerance from the deuill. They bee all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the Lordes praier, but wee as children néede to haue them particularly expreſſed, in that manner which may beſt helpe and guide vs.</p>
               <p>And touching praiers at the Sacraments, they may verye well be the ſame, ſéeing the thinges doo euer remaine the ſame which we are then to craue. Vnleſſe yée will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that there bee thinges in adminiſtration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at ſometime to be prayed for, and not at other. Then ſo farre as preſcript forme of prayer dooth fullye and fitlye expreſſe our néede, it is no babling, and ſo this your argument dooth not condemne it.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Read prayers were deuiſed by Antichriſt, and maintaine ſuperſtition and an idol miniſterie. Therefore read praiers are not tollerable, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Antichriſt deuiſed manye blaſphemous wicked prayers. But to ſay that the reading or following a preſcript forme of praier was his deuice, is moſt falſe: for there were leitur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies in the Church of olde, before Antichriſt was ſet in his throne. And moreouer, the preſcript formes deliuered in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14667:27"/>
the ſcriptures to be vſed, and which were vſed and practiſed by the Church, ſhewe that the thing is allowed by God. Yée ſay, I haue confeſſed, that I neuer read in the ſcriptures any warrant to reade praiers vnto God: and then it muſt néedes follow that it is antichriſtian. I ſay, you know that yée doo fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifie my ſpéech. For I ſaid and haue prooued, that it is great audacitie to affirme, that there is no warrant in Gods word for preſcript forme of praier. But I doo not remember that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I read in the ſcriptures, that God dooth commaund a man to reade the praier vpon the booke. My reaſon is rendered, that God dooth commend ſuch diligence in all his ſeruants, as to haue in memorie, &amp;c. Will ye gather thus, it is not expreſſely commaunded, therefore there is no warrant? it is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commaunded that euer I read, that the Miniſter ſhal make praier before and after his ſermon. Will yée charge me héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, that I ſay there is no warrant for it in the word? There would ſundrye inconueniences growe for want of preſcript forme of publike praiers. I did onely mention this, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery frantike ſpirit, of which ſort there may bee ſome in the Miniſtrie, will not onely be vnlike themſelues, but vary from others. You reply, that the Papiſts haue not ſo weake reaſons for their idolatrous leiturgies, rubrikes, and Canons. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by all your arguments, how méete men yée are to iudge of the waight and ſufficiencie of reaſons, alledged by the Papiſts or others. Ye ſay, if it be but in phraſes of ſpéech, that they differ, it is no ſufficient cauſe to ordaine leiturgies. I graunt that is true: then yée ſay, if it be in doctrine or conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, the cenſures of the Church are to helpe that. I confeſſe that the cenſures of the Church are to redreſſe ſuch things. But your reaſon yet hath two defaults. The one, that ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide differing in adminiſtration of Sacraments and publike praiers, but into two members, difference of phraſes, and difference of doctrine. When as there be ſundry other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, as in order and ceremonies, which the Church is to haue regard of, and not to leaue arbitrary. Your experience in theſe matters, is not ſo great as your boldneſſe. The other fault is, that becauſe the cenſures of the church ſhould redreſſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14667:27"/>
defaultes, therefore there néedeth no preſcribed order. It is a world to ſée, how many men talke of the Cenſures and gouernment of the Church, which knowe not what it mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
               <p>The Church hath this power, to ordeine according to the word of God, and to appoynt ſuch Orders in matters of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance about publike prayer, preaching of the word, and adminiſtring of the Sacraments, as ſhall moſt fitlie ſerue for edification. And then theſe Orders béeing eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by publike Authoritie, the Diſcipline and Cenſures of the Church are to driue men to the obſeruation of the ſame. Who is able to imagin the innumerable diuiſions and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which would ariſe in the practiſe of your Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſticall fréedome, in which, yee denye the Church to haue power to ordeyne and to impoſe any orders? I would the Miniſterie of England were better then it is. If by tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it a franticke Miniſterie, you meant but to ſpeake againſt vnlearned and vngodlie men, you ſhould haue leaue for me: but you comprehend all the learnedeſt and godly, whiche you could not bée bolde to doo, vnleſſe yee were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a frenſie, ſéeing there bée many whome yée are neuer lyke in any meaſure of giftes and graces, eyther for knowledge, or Godlyneſſe, to approch néere vnto. Well, now yée fall to your ſober reaſoning agayne. <hi>Paule</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> to admoniſhe <hi>Archippus,</hi> you would haue a Leiturgie for your Miniſters, not onely to tell them what they ſhould doo to men, but alſo to God himſelfe: this is your laſt reaſon, and hauing before ſpent your ſtrength, it is as a weake childe of your olde age. If yee had no better, I would neuer haue ſet this laſt. For I meruayle, vnleſſe yee did it to mocke, to what ende yee ſhoulde bring it in. <hi>Archippus</hi> was to bée admoniſhed by the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> the Paſtors are to bée admoniſhed by theyr flockes, therefore there ought to bée no preſcript forme of publike prayer. Or is your meaning, that the Leitur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies goe too farre in telling the Miniſters what they ſhall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14667:28"/>
ſay, not only to men, but to God himſelfe. Then I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> were to admoniſh <hi>Archippus,</hi> to looke to his whole dutie. Set <hi>Archippus</hi> aſide, for he doth not ſtrengthen, but weaken your argument, and take theſe words only, which ſéeme to carrie a great abſurditie, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Miniſter ſhould be told by a Leiturgie what he is to ſpeake both to God and men. I aunſwere, that the Leiturgie is not to teach Miniſters, which otherwiſe can not tell what to ſay: it is not to maintaine an idoll Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. But to auoyd thoſe inconueniences which I haue before mentioned, and ſuch lyke, you may ſée in the reformed Churches, they haue Leiturgies, and yet all theyr Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are able, and knowe what to ſpeake, both to God and men. I propounded this queſtion, that if read prayers, and impoſed Leiturgies bée Idolatrie, where ſhall wée fynde a viſible Churche? You aunſwere, that in this poynt they might erre of ignorance, and yet be the true Church. This is ſome fauour yet: the Church came nowe vnto yee in a lucky houre, but yee may continue thus gratious, leaſt the poore Churches of England craue the like at your hande. Haue yee not ſet downe, that to reade a prayer vppon the booke, is to woorſhip hym with a woorſhip diſagréeing from his nature? haue yee not ſayd, it is the deuiſe of Antichriſt, a dead letter, quenching the Spirit, ſtinting the Spirit, not of Faith, Idolatrie, a changing the worke of the Spirit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Idoll, a tradition and bondage, breaking our libertie which Chriſt hath purchaſed for vs, and therefore a thing moſt deteſtable? Doo yee not denye that to bée the Church of Chriſt which hath any thing impoſed? and yet yee ſaye touching Leiturgies impoſed vppon all Churches, they might erre in this poynt, of ignorance, and yet bée a true Church. Your ſpéeches doo condemne all the viſible Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the worlde, wherein, yée bée rancke <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> But you woulde hide this, and make ſhewe as though yée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned only the Churches of England. But if read pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and impoſed Leiturgies bée ſuch as you affyrme in thoſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14667:28"/>
ſpéeches which I haue mentioned, how could ignorance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them? And why may not the Church of Englande bée excuſed by ignorance? let the Reader héere obſerue the pride of ignorant blinde Sciſmatikes, which imagine they knowe more, then all the Churches of God in the earth. You take it that I vſe the Popiſh Argument of vniuerſalitie and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, and ſo wonder what I will ſay againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts traditions, ſéeing I fight with their weapons agaynſt the truth. Nay, if yée could ſée your owne blindneſſe, it would make ye meruaile in déede.</p>
               <p>I reaſon thus: It is manifeſt by the word of God, that there ſhould bée a true viſible Church in earth: but if impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Leiturgies be ſuch as you make them, that could not bée ſo, there could bée no true Church, in as much as all Churches that are and that haue béene for many hundred yeares, haue had impoſed Leiturgies.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts doo drawe theyr Arguments of Antiquitie and Vniuerſalitie not from the Scriptures, as you may ſée this reaſon that I alleadge is, but againſt the Scriptures. And nowe how truly yée conclude touching this queſtion of read Prayer, and preſcript forme of Leiturgies, let the Reader iudge: and whether the Scriptures that I haue brought, doo not ouerthrowe your fantaſticall and Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſticall errors.</p>
               <p>There were ioyned with theſe Arguments againſt read Prayer, two other: the firſt is this. The Prayers of ſuch Miniſters and people as ſtand vnder a falſe Gouernment, are not acceptable, not onely becauſe they aſke amiſſe, but becauſe they breake Gods commaundement. The other is, The Prayers of ſuch as bée ſubiect to Antichriſt, are abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. Thoſe Miniſters which haue no power with theyr people to receyue in, and to caſt out, hauing come in by the windowe, are Antichriſtian, and ſubiect to Antichriſt, therefore the prayers of &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe doo concerne the third and fourth accuſation, and therefore the Aunſwere is included in the Aunſwere to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14667:29"/>
them. Yet I tooke exception againſt the firſt, that the Church may be holden by force from executing Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touching externall Gouernment, and yet be the true Church of God. And for example, I alleadged the Church that was held captiue in Babylon.</p>
               <p>You according to your vſuall manner, extend this to a wilfull violating of Gods commaundement. And further, you deale in that which yée demaund, as if all your accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Churche of Englande were true, touching Idolatrous worſhip. You ſhould aunſwere directly, whether they be not the Church of God which are by force, being willing, kept backe from executing Church Gouernment? You take your ſelues to be the true Church, and yet yée are reſtrayned from ſetting vp thoſe Orders which yée pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ye would. I would knowe whether this bée not ſome bondage. If yée ſay yet this is not to be ſubiect to any falſe gouernment. To prooue that the Church may of ignorance and frailtie bée in ſome bondage of a falſe gouernment, and yet bée the true Church, I indeuored to ſhewe, that Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem from aboue is not in this world ſo fullie poſſeſſed of her fréedome, but that ſhée, and euerie one of her children, bée in ſome ſpirituall bondage. For proofe, I alleadged that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſayeth, <hi>He ſawe in his members a lawe, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt the lawe of his minde, and leading him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to the lawe of ſinne Rom. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You cry out and ſay, yée will thinke me a carnall Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, if I recant not this doctrine. What Atheiſt (ſay you) would thus haue defended his groſſe ſinne? I doo not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle that yée are moued ſo ſore at this doctrine, for if it bée prooued that the true Church, and euerie member of the ſame, is tyed in ſome ſpirituall bondage in this world, it breaketh the mayne piller of <hi>Browniſme,</hi> which they erect out of this ſentence, <hi>Ieruſalem from aboue is free with her children,</hi> and ſo their whole frame commeth downe: this maketh you ſo haſtely to thruſt vnder a rotten proppe, euen as it came to hand. Ye ſay, that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> neuer continued captiue vnto
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14667:29"/>
ſinne after regeneration, neither gaue place vnto euill thoughts: no more doo any of you. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that the law in his members did lead him captiue to the lawe of ſinne. He ſaith I do the euil which I hate. I my ſelfe in my minde ſerue the law of God, and in my fleſh the lawe of ſinne. Was not <hi>Dauid</hi> regenerate, and yet gaue place to euill thoughts, ſo farre as to commit adultrie and murther. If the regeneration and fréedome of <hi>Browniſts</hi> from all ſpirituall bondage be ſuch, that they giue not place vnto euill thoughts, they ſhall neuer haue any great company, vnleſſe it be of ranke hypocrites, of ſuch indéed there may be ſtoare. Ye looke that I ſhould recant. But I ſay, either you or S. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt recant: for that which you ſay, is flat contrary and oppoſite to that which hee ſaith. Looke well to it, for I tell ye, he is too conſtant to recant. If it pleaſe God to beſtow his grace, you may. Ye ſay, what Atheiſt would thus haue defended his groſſe ſinne? And I ſay, what Heretike could more bouldly ſpeake flat contrary to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtle, and to the manifeſt doctrine of the Scriptures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered euery where, then you doe? it may be ye ſtand chéefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the words of our Sauiour, which yée alledge: that no man can ſerue two maiſters. If the regenerate be held captiue in any part vnto ſinne, they ſerue two maiſters. This needeth to be opened.</p>
               <p>We are moſt ſure that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in that hée ſaith, dooth not differ from our Sauiour Chriſt, and yet in ſhewe hee ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to ſpeake quite contrary. For where the one ſaith: No man can ſerue two Maiſters. The other ſaith: I my ſelfe in my minde ſerue the lawe of God, and in my fleſh the lawe of ſinne. How ſhall this bee reconciled? is there no waye but to fall vpon the rockes of Browniſme, and to imagine that the regenerate are ſo fréed, that they be in no captiuitie vnto ſinne, nor giue place vnto euill thoughtes? Yes verelye: The regenerate doo fall into ſinne, not onelye in thoughts but in déedes: not onelye of ignorance, but euen againſt theyr knowledge, as <hi>Dauid, Peter,</hi> and manye other in the holye Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:14667:30"/>And therefore they may be ſaid to ſerue ſinne in the fleſh, that is in the corruption yet remaining in them, not extinguiſhed by the law of the minde, that is the grace and worke of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet the doubt remaineth, for all is but one man, ſo farre as he is regenerate, and ſo farre as he is corrupt: and therefore when in the fleſh he dooth ſerue the law of ſinne, the whole man may be ſaid to ſerue the lawe of ſinne. S. <hi>Paul</hi> dooth deny that, and ſaith: I doo the euill that I hate, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the lawe of God that it is good, I delight in the law of God concerning the inner man, it is no longer I that ſinne, but the ſinne that dwelleth in me. We ſée then the ſame man ſinneth, and in ſome reſpect is ſaide to be in captiuitie, and to ſerue ſinne, and in an other reſpect he is accounted with God, not to ſerue ſinne, ſéeing he is by tyrannous forcing drawne to doo that which he hateth. How ſtandeth the fréedome then of Ieruſalem, and her Children? I ſay, her perfect fréedome with all her children is in the remiſſion of ſinnes. Touching that ſhe hath in this world, it may thus be compared. As if a man lye bound in chaines, ſo that he cannot ſtirre any member, and after his chaines be looſed he can riſe and walke: but yet his chaines hang vpon him, and are a burthen, hee cannot caſt them off. For by nature we are ſo faſt chained, that we haue no moouing at all in vs, being dead in ſinne. But through the worke of regeneration we are borne, we are raiſed, our bands and chaines are looſed and broken: we can riſe, we can ſtand, we can walke, though faintlye, our chaines, euen a lumpe of corruption in the fleſh, preſſing vs downe ſo ſore. Then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that ſeeing the Church in this life is in ſome bondage to ſinne, and yet the true Church. And ſéeing there may be the true viſible Church vnder ſome yoake of outward bondage: let the Church of England haue that fauour which other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue had, and not bee ſo rigorouſlye condemned.

               <hi>The ſecond fault is, that all the prophane multitudes, without exception of any one perſon, are admitted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the boſome of the Church. Manye Churches in England want godly Paſtours, and there all are admitted. It may be, he that admitteth is the worſt in the company.

               <hi>Heere you confeſſe, that very many Churches in England want godly Paſtours, and that there all are admitted, and that he that admitteth them is the worſte of the company.

            </p>
            <div type="response">
               <p>I did confeſſe, and doo ſtill with gréefe, that in very manye<note place="margin">G. G.</note> aſſemblies in England, all are admitted to the Table of the Lord, which offer themſelues, euen the moſt prophane and groſſe ſinners. I ſhewed alſo, the reaſon of this gréeuous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, namely that the miniſters which ſhould repell ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen offenders, are many times the worſt, or at leaſt negligent in that behalfe. And moreouer, that the Church of England dooth neither approoue ſuch admiſſion of prophane men to the Sacrament, nor yet ſuffer it in practiſe wholy. For touching practiſe, there be many congregations in the land, where ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie for ignorance, and open wickedneſſe, are by the miniſters kept backe, and not ſuffered to communicate, vntill they ſhew repentance. And for not approouing ſuch admiſſion, I ſaid, the booke of Common prayer dooth preſcribe and commaund the repelling of notorious wicked offendours: and alſo that ſome are excommunicated iuſtly, &amp; not admitted to publike praier. This was the firſt part of mine anſwer: wherein I prooue your accuſation falſe. The other is, that the godly are not pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14667:31"/>
by the companye of the wicked, which are ſuffered to communicate with them in Gods worſhip, and the thing not in their power to redreſſe. And for example I alledged the Church of the Iewes. By which I prooue, that if your accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were true, yet it deſtroyeth not the Church. Now let vs examine how you ouerthrowe this by your replye. Yée aſke whether there were no more prophane in the pariſh beſides thoſe twenty or thirty which are repelled? And whether thoſe other prophane were not admitted? I anſwer, If there were, yet the repelling of twenty or thirty in a flock, dooth ſhew that you accuſe falſely, when yée ſay, all the prophane, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of any one perſon, are reteined in the body and boſome of our Church: But to prooue your article at once, as yée ſay, by a more direct courſe, yée bring an argument. And yée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand if I know anye in all the realme of England vnbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. Is not Baptiſme (ſay you) a Sacrament belonging to the Church, by which all the faithfull and their ſéed doo enter into it? Wherevpon yée argue thus? All being baptized, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that all are receiued into the body of your Church. Now being once receiued in, they can no way be caſt out but by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. And it is manifeſt, that the Parſon and all his pariſh, hath not the powre which Chriſt hath left vnto his Church, to excommunicate any offender, be he neuer ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or notorious, &amp;c. This being the onely reaſon by which ye ſtand to prooue the truth of your accuſation, I muſt beſtow the more paines about it. Thus it muſt be ſet in forme. Where all are receiued in by Baptiſme, and no power to caſt foorth any by excommunication, there all the prophane multitudes are without exception of any one perſon, receiued into, &amp; retei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the boſome and body of the Church: But in the Church of England all are receiued in by Baptiſme, and there is no power to caſt foorth any by excommunication: Therefore in England, all the prophane multitudes, without exception of any one perſon, are receiued into, and reteined in the boſome and body of the Church. In your propoſition there are to be excepted ſuch as are repelled from the Sacrament, who are in ſome ſort, for the time, remooued out of the boſome of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14667:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Church. And alſo ſuch Papiſts, Heretikes, and Sciſmatikes, as depart out of themſelues. It is further alſo to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in it, that all the baptized, continuing outwardly obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they cannot be iuſtly called the prophane multitudes. Your preſumption, in which ye charge the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with a principall tranſgreſſion, for receiuing in all by Baptiſme, and hauing no power to caſt foorth any by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, is with foule error and falſehood.</p>
               <p>Touching the Baptiſme of Infants, this appeareth to be your iudgement, that the children of prophane men which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in the Church, and profeſſe the faith of Chriſt, belong not to the couenant, and therefore ought not to be Baptiſed. No doubt the Church doth offend, when open notorious ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are not Excommunicate, and brought to repentance, or at the leaſt to ſuch a ſhewe of repentance, as that men can not further iudge them but as Brethren. It is alſo an offence, where ſuch not being caſt foorth, their children are receyued vnto Baptiſme, and that without care to ſée them brought vp and inſtructed in the Chriſtian Religion, and to leade a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life agréeable to the ſame. But to ſay, that the children of prophane men, taking prophane men as you doo, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſtianitie, and remayne in the Church, are not to be Baptiſed, is a very wicked iniurie to Gods people, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the manifeſt doctrine of the holie Scriptures, and can not without Hereſie be mayntayned.</p>
               <p>Firſt, touching prophane people, it is certayne that all Heathen Heretikes, all Sciſmatikes, open contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the holie Religion, and all obſtinate wicked men whiche deſpiſe the cenſure of the Church, that hath paſſed vppon them, may be called prophane. But you <hi>Browniſts</hi> go further, and condemne them all as Infidels and prophane, which profeſſe the faith of Chriſt, becauſe notwithſtanding they doo it in ſome weakenes and infirmities: which is a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked preſumption, and intruſion into Gods ſeate, and in which (as I haue ſhewed before) yée breake the rule of diſcipline giuen by our Sauiour Chriſt, by which, no brother, that is,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:14667:32"/>
none which profeſſeth the true faith, is for his ſinnes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie to be iudged as heathen, vntill he haue deſpiſed the admonition of the Church, and ſo be caſt foorth. You take vppon yée to plucke vp all the Darnell: yée are commaunded the contrarie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leaſt yée plucke vp the Wheate <hi>Math. 13.</hi> You dare, and that in moſt ſauage and deſperate manner, rend and teare vp the weake plants: yée doo it vnto whole aſſemblyes, in which there be many that vnfaynedly ſorrow and mourne for their ſinnes, and ſtudie to pleaſe God: all that feare the Lord, may tremble at this your intollerable wickednes. But now to procéede. Ye will not allowe the children of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men the Sacrament of Baptiſme. And what is your reaſon? they bée not the ſéede of the faithfull. In déede in this yée ſay true, that none are in theyr infancie to be admitted to this Sacrament, but the ſéede of the faithfull: but when yée take it that the children whoſe next parents are hypocrites, or wicked and prophane perſons, which yet remayne in the Church, and profeſſe Chriſt, be not the ſéede of the faithfull at all, and in any reſpect, and ſo within the couenant, and to be baptized, yée are farre wide: for let it be that their next parents before haue béene hypocrites and vnfaithfull, yet may they bée the ſéede of the faithfull: for their intereſt in Gods couenant doth (as béeing the ſeede of the faithfull) not depend vppon theyr next parents, but vppon the auncient Chriſtians theyr fore-fathers: for when he ſayth, I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeede, the promiſe is made to a thouſand generations, <hi>Exod. 20.</hi> It is ſayd, that <hi>Leuy</hi> payd Tithes vnto <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> becauſe he was in the loynes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he met <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> and gaue Tythes, <hi>Hebrewes 7. ver. 9. 10.

and of the couenant <hi>Acts. 3. ver. 25.</hi> So doth <hi>S.

Why then are they called holie, and the holie people, being many of them reprobates? Is it not becauſe they be <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeede, and were in the Church by outward profeſſion, adding this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that the elect of God, euen the right holie ſeede, were in theyr loynes: for Gods choſen did not ſpring only from the ſanctifyed, but alſo from other, who touching the outward profeſſion, and touching the holy ſeede which was in theyr loynes, were eſteemed as members in the Church, and were all of them, euen the whole nation, called the holy people. It is not diſalowed, that in the times of idolatrie openly maintained, their children were circumciſed. Nay further, the Lord calleth the children of thoſe wicked idolaters, his children, <hi>Thou haſt</hi> (ſayth he by <hi>Ezechiel) taken thy ſonnes and thy daughters which thou broughteſt foorth vnto me, and ſacrificed vnto them, to be conſumed. Thou haſt ſlayne my ſonnes, and giuen them, by cauſing them to paſſe through to them, Ezech. 16. ver. 21.</hi> Theſe Idolaters did offer their children to Deuils, euen to the Idols of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſhead innocent bloud, euen the bloud of their ſonnes and daughters, when they cauſed them to paſſe through the fire, <hi>Pſal. 106.</hi> If the promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſéede had not béen ſo effectual, as that the holy choſen ſéede was in the loyns of theſe Idolaters, how could they be ſaid to bring foorth Sonnes &amp; Daughters to the Lord? How could it be ſayd, thou haſt ſlayn my ſonnes? or how could they rightly haue béen cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed? If ye ſay, theſe Idolaters ſhould not haue remained
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:14667:33"/>
in the Church, but if not by the Ciuill power put to death, yet by the cenſure of the Church caſt foorth. Yea, but there was ſo generall a declining, that neyther of theſe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: and ſo they remayned ſtyll in the Church, and brought foorth children vnto God, euen ſuch as the couenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> did belong vnto, they were in his loines, they were his ſéede, and not cut off by the wickednes of theyr next parents. If yée obiect that the <hi>Iewes</hi> nowe at this day are the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and by that reaſon ſhould be ſtill the viſible Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I aunſwere, that although there be Gods elect among them, whome eyther he taketh away in their infancie, or elſe calleth them to knowe Chriſt when they come to mans eſtate: yet the <hi>Iewes</hi> can not now be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the viſible Church, nor the Church, in as much as they haue reiected hym in whome the Couenant was ratifyed, euen the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and therefore he ſayde vnto them, the Vineyard ſhall be taken from thoſe Huſbandmen, and let foorth vnto other. And then expounding himſelfe, he ſayth, the Kingdome of God ſhall be taken from yee, and giuen to a nation, that will bring foorth the fruite thereof. The Vineyard was not taken from thoſe naughtie Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen that killed the ſeruants of the Lord of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard which came for fruites, euen the Prophets, vntill they had killed the ſonne and heire himſelfe. Now the naturall braunches are broken off, and the wilde oliues, euen the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are graffed in, <hi>Rom. 11.</hi> They are nowe the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heyres of the promiſe, as it is ſayd, I haue made thée a father of many Nations. And in thy ſéede all Nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed. Our fore-fathers, many of them declyned in the Apoſtaſie, and worſhipped Idols: but as the Idolatrous <hi>Iewes,</hi> ſo they remayned ſtill in the Church, and brought foorth children to God, that is, ſuch as were within the Couenant, to be accounted the holie ſéede, and ſo of right were to haue the ſeale of the couenant ſet vpon them, euen Baptiſme. We can not ſay therefore that the Couenant was diſanulled, and that the Churche vtterlie fayled, no not euen in the moſt horrible confuſion
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:14667:33"/>
of popery, but Antichriſt did ſit in the temple of God, <hi>2. Theſ. 2</hi> Thoſe idolaters were in the Church, and the heirs of promiſe in their loines, for we and all the Churches are ſprung out of them, ſealed with the ſigne of the Couenant, as of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing vnto vs from our holye aunceſtors. But you <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> as Catabaptiſts, denie that we haue the ſigne of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant: for yee ſay we haue no Sacraments. If we bee not within the Couenant from our anceſtours, what are you? who hath béene ſent from God to call yée vnto a Couenant, which yée were not within before? Who hath giuen yée the ſigne of the Couenant? or haue yee receiued a couenant without a ſigne? How will you indure this terrible voice of Almightie God: yée haue rooted vppe and caſt foorth my ſonnes and my daughters? For if it were ſaid to idolators, yée haue ſlaine my ſonnes? how much more vnto you, which in a moſt proud fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, with intollerable boldneſſe and crueltie, roote vp and caſt foorth the infants of whole aſſemblies, which haue renounced idolatry, and profeſſe the Goſpell, becauſe yée doo account them prophane? Let it be, they are many of them nothing ſuch as they ought to be, but ſinners, and ſuch as ſhould by the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church bee brought into better order, yet profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt, and remaining in the Church, their infants are not by their vngodlineſſe caſt foorth of the Couenant. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that the Church of England, or at the leaſt many of the teachers and guides doo offend, in not executing the diſcipline vpon vngodly men, to bring them to repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in receiuing their children to be baptized, they doo not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, ſo they ſée them taught in the faith, and to liue a godlye life, as our Church hath eſtabliſhed, yea in refuſing them the infants ſhould receiue great iniurie.</p>
               <p>But to make this matter yet more cléere, the queſtion is to be anſwered, whether the Church of Rome be the Church of Chriſt. For the <hi>Browniſts</hi> doo hold, that our aunceſtors were not the Church of Chriſt in the time of poperie, and that we now are confuſed multitudes, not rightlye entered into coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, to become a Church, ſéeing wee were not of Gods true Church before, neither orderly entered into coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:14667:34"/>
Indéed if we were not within the couenant before from our aunceſtors, nor entered orderly to become a Church, the matter would ſéeme ſtrong againſt vs. Let it therefore be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. I know this is the vſuall ſpéech of the learnedeſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, the church of God is in the Papacie, but the Papacie is not the church. And it may be, the ſenſe will differ little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but I take it a fitter ſpéech to ſaye, the Papacie is in the church, then to ſay, the church is in the papacie. For Antichriſt dooth ſit in the Temple of God: his lawes, his worſhip, and all his abhominations, were brought into the church. All the men which receiued his marke, and worſhipped him, were in the church, yea euen the whole Apoſtaſie was in the churche. The church was before, and that commeth after, and entreth into or ariſeth in it. Then to the queſtion, if by the church of Rome we vnderſtand the Pope, his lawes, his worſhip which hath béene deuiſed by himſelfe, his adherents, and all that worſhip him or receiue his Marke. I anſwer, that this is that which may properly be called the church of Rome, which is, the papacie, the apoſtaſie, and ſeduced to damnation, and not the church of Chriſt, otherwiſe then thus, that the Pope, the Cardinals, and all that worſhip the Beaſt, be falſe Chriſtians by profeſſion, bred in the Church, and continuing in it, their ſéede not excluded from the couenant. But if by the Church of Rome, we vnderſtand all thoſe companies of people, ouer whome the tyrannie of the Pope hath heeretofore extended it ſelfe, or dooth at this day: or thoſe things which were giuen by Chriſt, which remaine in the ſame. I ſay, this is not the church of Rome, but the Church of God. Firſt, if we reſpect the holye doctrine of God, in all thoſe points which were and are kept ſound among them, and the holye Sacrament of Baptiſme. Then ſecondly, if we conſider the kingdoms and people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, all did not fall from Chriſt, but many held the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the moſt of them lying ſcattered and hid in the deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ruines. Thirdly, if we regard that the infants not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of theſe faithfull, but euen of the wicked Apoſtates which worſhipped the beaſt, were ſtill within the couenant as the holy ſéed: we ſhall ſee that the papacie was, and is, in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14667:34"/>
Church, which is the Temple of God, and not the ſynagog of Rome. The Church of Rome then is not the true Church of God: but the Church of Rome is the Apoſtaſie in the church. Let vs come then more particularly. The church of England in the time of poperie was a member of the vniuerſall church, and had not the being of a church of Chriſt from Rome, nor tooke not her beginning of being a Church, by ſeperating hir ſelfe from that Romiſh ſynagog: but hauing her ſpirites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued, and her eyes opened by the light of the heauenly word, did caſt foorth that tyrannie of Antichriſt, with his abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble idolatrie, hereſies, and falſe worſhip: and ſought to bring all her children vnto the right faith, and true ſeruice of God: And ſo is a purer and more faithfull church then before. Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie was openly ſet vp in the church of Iſrael, at ſundrye times. It did not, as I haue ſhewed, diſanull the couenant of God with them, nor debarre their children from the holy ſigne of circumciſion, but all the Iewes are called the children of the couenant. Then let the <hi>Browniſt</hi> ſhew ſome reaſon, why it ſhould bee otherwiſe in this caſe with our churches, then it was with the church of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the one part of your aſſumption, wherein ye blame the church of England, for receiuing in all by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. Now touching the other part of it, in which ye affirme that there is no power to caſt foorth any by excommunication, yée ſpeake very falſely. For the church of England hath ſome power to excommunicate. But you reaſon thus: the perſon and all his pariſh hath not the power to excommunicate anye one offendor, therefore the church of England hath not powre to excommunicate. Is it poſſible, if a man would ſtudy to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon abſurdlie, that he ſhould excell yée? Will yee argue thus: euery ſeuerall part by it ſelfe hath not power to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate: therefore the whole together hath not the power? It is not méete indéed, that the Parſon and his pariſh ſhould haue the power to excommunicate, vnleſſe it bee ſuch a Pariſh as hath the Conſiſtorie of Paſtors, Teachers, and Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. It ſéemeth yée haue great ſkill in the diſcipline of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:14667:35"/>The ſeuerall flockes about <hi>Geneua</hi> without the Citie haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one a Paſtor, and two Elders: but yet they haue not the power to excommunicate, but that is referred to the Conſiſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which is within the Citie, Maiſter <hi>Beza, Epiſt. 20.</hi> Will yée ſay thoſe ſeuerall flockes cannot be the Churches of Chriſt, vnleſſe their paſtors and they together haue power to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate? They are members of that church which hath power to excommunicate. But yée will ſay, that the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Commiſſarie is no excommunication, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our pariſhes be no members of a church, which hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to excommunicate.</p>
               <p>The like yée will ſay of the excommunication by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop himſelfe, and by the Archdeacon. I aunſwer, that if it ſhould bée graunted ye, that their excommunication dooth not binde in heauen, yet it is of force to remooue, and dooth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue from the ſocietye of our aſſemblies, which prooueth your accuſation falſe, becauſe we reaſon about this outward remoouing. But what if the Biſhop, together with ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſters of the Goſpell, doo excommunicate duely an obſtinate wicked man, is he not excommunicate before God? If there be an heretike conuinced, and found obſtinate, and the Biſhops and Miniſters of the Church of England aſſembled, or ſome competent number of them, as in the conuocation, or ſuch ſynod do duely excommunicate him, is it no excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? Will yée reaſon after this ſort, that becauſe euery Miniſter with his flocke ſeuerally, hath not the power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, therefore the Miniſters of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are vtterly without this power? You confeſſe that it is the Church of Chriſt which hath this power, though it fault much by negligence in executing the ſame. I would all <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> could conſider, what it is to excommunicate, or to cut, not onely particular perſons, but whole aſſemblies from Chriſt, it would abate their horrible preſumption.</p>
               <p>Then for the ſuſpenſion from the Sacrament, by which the vnworthy, either for ignorance, or open wicked life, are ſeperated from the néere fellowſhip of the Church, I ſaid yée might demaund by what right the miniſter dooth it? Yée ſay,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14667:35"/>
that indéede would be knowne, adding moreouer, that if it be in the nature of Excommunication, it were no ſmall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in the Miniſter to arrogate ſuch abſolute authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to himſelfe. I hold it ſomewhat in the nature of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, in ſuch, as haue béene before admitted, but yet not to be compared as any thing néere ſo great as Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication: and neuertheleſſe, I déeme it no preſumption for the Miniſter, to repell the vnworthy from the Sacrament. He is to take héede to himſelfe, that he giue not holie things to dogs. He is to beware of that which may giue publike of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and bring the holie myſteries into contempt. It is in déede no ſmall matter to debarre from the Sacrament. The Miniſter therefore may eaſily offende in this caſe diuers wayes: as namely, if he be carried with euill will for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate reſpects toward any, and ſo aggrauate their offences, and make that heynous which is not: or if he doo not make the matter apparant ſo much as he can, that the flocke may ſée there is iuſt cauſe to repell them, and no iniurie offered, the crimes for which they are remoued being notorious.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe I ſayd, the booke of common Prayer doth warrant this, héere yée ſet vp your briſtles, and firſt it may not be let paſſe, but noted, that euen the beſt of our Churches ſtand vnder this Idoll by our owne confeſſion. This is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall note, and well marked. Why, did ye not knowe that we vſe the booke in publike prayer, and adminiſtration of Sacraments? Then yee aſke if the booke be Chriſts newe Teſtament, that we muſt fetch our warrant and direction from that Idoll? I might aſke you a queſtion, whether ye be in your wits? for doo we diſpute héere, whether a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is warranted in conſcience before God to repell any from the Sacrament? I thought that you <hi>Browniſts</hi> whiche take vppon yee to iudge, and vtterly to abandon and caſt foorth whole aſſemblyes which profeſſe the Goſpell, and which are eſtéemed of the godly Churches as Siſters, had made no doubt, but that by Gods word the Miniſter is warranted to repell a notorious wicked man from the Sacrament. But I
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:14667:36"/>
ſuppoſed yee would obiect, that by the eſtabliſhed order and gouernment of our Church, all power to keepe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from wicked prophanation, is taken away from the Miniſters, and for this I alleadged the booke. Let the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der now iudge, how fitlie yee clap your wings and crowe, ſaying: In déede it is a fit Porteſſe for ſuch Prieſts, and the ſuſpenſion ye vaunt of, a fit toole for ſuch workemen, euen the inſtruments of that fooliſh Shepheard. If the iudgement of God (you ſay) were not vppon our right eye, we might ſée how our Lords the Byſhops doo dreſſe vs, and perceyue how this weapon that they allowe vs, wanteth both edge and poynt &amp;c.</p>
               <p>You ſpeake, as if the Byſhops did take vppon them, and we ſubmitte our ſelues vnto them, as Lords ouer our faith and conſciences, and as though we were at theyr allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, when as in déede they bée but miniſters to ſée thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders kept which bée alreadie eſtabliſhed, and haue not autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to take from any Miniſter that power which the booke doth giue him: much leſſe can one word of maiſter Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries mouth heale the greateſt wound (as you ſay) we can make with it. Yee ſay, not one in the Pariſh ſetteth a flye by it. Yee ſpeake ſo confidentlie, and with ſuch ſhewe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, that I ſhould beléeue yee in theſe things, if I had not for ſundrie yeares tryed and ſéene your words falſe by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. I ſayd, ſuch as be iuſtly Excommunicate, as ſome are, be not admitted to the publike prayer. Héere yee bid ſée how God inſnareth me in mine owne words, and how hard a bad cauſe is to defend. What is the ſnare which I am héere caught in? Forſooth I doo héere openly iuſtifie Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Commiſſarie, becauſe we haue no other power or meanes, and our Church wardens doo ſtand ſworne to that Court. But how ſhall I get out of your ſnare? I muſt be fayne to breake it, if it be not looſe of it ſelfe. What if when I ſay ſome are Excommunicate iuſtly, I haue reſpect, not to thoſe which Excommunicate, but to the deſert of them that be Excommunicated. Againe, it is vntrue that ye ſay, our
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:14667:36"/>
Church hath no power, but the Commiſſaries Court (as I haue alreadie ſhewed.) Touching your next ſpéech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yee charge vs, that we thincke to heale, or at the leaſt, to couer enormities with theſe two drie withered figge leaues, the one, that we can not remedie the matter, the other, that priuate men are not to reforme: the aunſwere ſhall be more fitte, when wée come to ſhewe what priuate men may doo.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come to the other part of mine Anſwer which denyed the conſequence, though your accuſation were true, which is this: Wicked prophane men are receyued in, and retayned in the boſome and bodie of their Church, therefore the Couenant is diſanulled with them, and they are no longer Gods people, but a falſe Antichriſtian ſynagog. To diſprooue this, I did alleadge, that there were but a fewe true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers that frequented the Temple among multitudes of prophane and vngodly men. To which ye reply, that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our Church to the Temple of God, and ſtill begging the queſtion, I frame my Arguments as though our people were faithfull, and our prayers holie. I pray yee what is the queſtion which I begge? This ſay you, is the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether the aſſemblyes in England be the true Church of God? and then yee woulde beare the Reader in hand, that I reaſon in ſuch ſort as I would firſt haue this graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it is a true Church of faithfull people, and holie worſhip. You ſhould haue done well to haue ſhewed how I frame my Arguments from the Queſtion graunted. But the truth is, yee can ſhewe no colour héere of any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>Nowe may I charge you, and that iuſtly, which I wyll alſo make apparant to all which will not ſhut theyr eyes, that in ſtead of anſwering, yee doo not onely cauill, but moſt ſottiſhly with a blinde ſhift. For our queſtion heere is this, the Church of England doth receyue in and retayne in her boſome the prophane multitude, therfore the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is not the true Church. To diſproue this, I reaſon thus,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14667:37"/>
the Church of Iſrael retayned the multitude of wicked ones in her boſome, for there were but fewe true worſhippers frequented the Temple among multitudes of prophane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men. Therefore this fault doth not deſtroy the béeing of a true Church, neyther is the worſhip and prayers of the faithfull polluted by the company of the wicked which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip together with them, eſpecially when they can not reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die the matter. To ouerthrowe this Argument, you muſt of neceſſitie prooue one of theſe two things, eyther that the Church of Iſraell did not retayne the prophane multitude in her boſome, and ſo the good and the bad worſhipped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or elſe that they were not Gods Church when this was ſuffered, but all that came ſo together fell from God. You ſhift from this, and ſpeake of Idolatrous times, in which it is moſt certayne that the godly did not mixe themſelues with the wicked in idolatrous worſhip. We doo not argue whether the godly did ioyne with the wicked in idolatrous worſhip, for it is moſt cléere they might not, nor did not. But whether the wicked were ſuffered, and did ioyne with the godly in the true worſhip? and whether they were polluted by communicating with them, and that ſo gréeuouſly, as to diſanull the Couenant? let the Scriptures be iudge in both theſe. If I ſhould ſtand to recite all the teſtimonies, and all the complaints which are made by the Prophets againſt the multitudes of wicked which worſhipped together with the godly at ſundrie times, it would be long, ſome fewe may ſuffice in a matter ſo euident. He that readeth the bookes of <hi>Moyſes</hi> touching the ſtate of the Church for the ſpace of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares in the wilderneſſe, what ſhall he finde in the moſt but multitudes of prophane rebels, againſt whome, the Lord ſware, that they ſhould not ſée his reſt, whoſe carcaſſes alſo he ouerthrewe in the deſert, and yet they were not caſt out of the aſſemblie, nor ſeparated from the reſt ſo long as they liued, nor their ſeede reiected? If yee will ſee an epitome of their rebellions for that ſpace, and for the time of the Iudges, looke vppon the 106. Pſalme.</p>

                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:14667:37"/>Afterward, when the Kings of Iuda raigned euen vntill the captiuitie, what gréeuous complaints are made againſt them?

This were enough to ſhew the groſſe hereſie of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> in this point: but yet I will adde ſomewhat of the Churches founded by the Apoſtles. In the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reprooueth many things. There were factions and ſchiſmes among them. The Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers did ſet foorth the Goſpell with humane wiſdome. The Paſtors and Gouernours did not execute the diſcipline, but ſuffered the inceſtuous perſon. They ſtraue one with an other in the law before Heathen Iudges. They feaſted in the idol Temples, at the feaſts which were kept in honor of the idols, and ſo were partakers of the cup of Deuils. They prophaned the holye Supper of the Lorde, they abuſed ſpirituall gifts. There were among them which denied the reſurrection of the dead.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Browniſt</hi> will héere replye, that this Church did repent being reprehended by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as he witneſſeth of them, <hi>2.

               <p>The ſeauen Churches of <hi>Aſia, Reuel. 1.</hi> were not in euery reſpect commended: for in ſome of them the <hi>Nicholaitans</hi> were ſuffered, and they that taught the doctrine of <hi>Balaam,</hi> and a wicked woman, which made her ſelfe a Prophetiſſe, was ſuffered to teach and to ſeduce the ſeruants of God. One Church neither hote nor colde. Another had but a fewe in it which had not polluted themſelues, <hi>Reuel. 2.</hi> and 3. Yet are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:14667:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
theſe named the Churches. I conclude therefore, that the not ſeperating of ſome wicked ones out of the Churche, although it be euill, yet is not ſuch an euill as deſtroyeth the Church, and that the godly are not polluted by the wicked, which come together with them vnto the publike exerciſes of the holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>Thus haue I prooued your article, or your accuſation, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereticall, and partly falſe. I haue alſo made manifeſt, that if yée did accuſe rightly, yet the conſequence is to be diſalowed as hereticall, in as much as we ſée, that very often it hath come to paſſe, that heapes of vngodly men haue worſhipped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the godly, and they not polluted by them. It may be ſome will thinke hardly that I account it hereticall, that the <hi>Browniſt</hi> concludeth after this ſorte, they haue open ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and men prophane in life, which doo worſhip together with them, as members of their Church, therefore the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is diſanulled with them all. I will therefore prooue that I haue ſaid by ſtrong arguments: the firſt ſhall be this. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer maintaineth, that where any groſſe ſinnes breake forth and appeare, there is not any true faith in the parties which offend, he doth contrary to the expreſſe word of God, maintaine flat hereſie: for we are taught euery where, that regeneration which conſiſteth in putting of the old man, and putting on the new, is by degrées wrought in Gods elect. Whervpon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt compareth the ſpirituall birth with the naturall. A man is borne a poore weake babe, not able to go alone, or yet to ſtand vpright: hee is nouriſhed and fed with milke, and ſo in continuance, dooth growe vp by degrées vnto mans eſtate. We are borne againe, not of mortall but of immortall ſeed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the word of God which indureth foreuer, <hi>1. Pet. 1.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he willeth, that laying aſide all maliciouſnes, deceipt, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and ſuch like, we couet the ſincere milke of the word, that we may grow thereby, <hi>1. Pet. 2. ver. 1. &amp; 2.</hi> The regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are in many places exhorted to put off, and to mortifie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and vncleane luſts, &amp; to forſake their wicked ſins, <hi>Rom. 12.

How many, ſhall we then ſuppoſe, are the falles of poore new borne Babes? if <hi>Dauid, Solomon, Samſon,</hi> and many other, repleniſhed with great grace, did fall gréeuouſly, how ſhall we looke that other ſhall be frée? Let the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> be for an example in this point, euen the teachers and people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, vnto whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth thus: <hi>I could not ſpeake vnto yee brethren, as vnto ſpirituall men, but as vnto carnall men, as vnto babes in Chriſt. I gaue yee milke to drinke and not meate, for yee could not beare it, neither can yee now: for yee are yet carnall: for when as there are among yee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, contention, and diſcords, are yee not carnall and walke as men? when one ſaith, I am of Paul, an other I am of Apollo, are yee not carnall? 1. Cor. 3. ver. 1. 2. 3. 4.</hi> Is not the matter as cléere as the Sunne, that he calleth them carnal, burthened with the fleſh, and in that reſpect prophane, as their open ſinnes did declare, and yet babes in Chriſt, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate through faith, and the déere children of God? It is ſaid of our Sauiour, <hi>Hee will not breake the bruſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax Math. 12. ver. 20.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſteps of his Maiſter, in care, in loue, in mercie, and compaſſion, toward the poore weake babes in Chriſt, behaued himſelfe in the Churches, as a nurſſe vnto hir little infants. <hi>1. Theſſ. 2. ver. 8.</hi> But the fierce <hi>Browniſts</hi> doo maintaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this manifeſt doctrine of the Scriptures: that where corrupt manners breake foorth in thoſe that profeſſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, they be not onely vtterly voide of faith which offend, but alſo, that all they which worſhip together with them, though neuer ſo much gréeued at their ſinnes, are fallen from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant moſt cruelly by this meanes, thruſting downe all the weake, and caſting foorth all poore babes. I may ſay the ſtrong together with them: therefore the <hi>Browniſts</hi> doo maintaine hereſye. Euery faithfull man is to follow the example of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Paul,</hi> in that which he dooth teſtifie of himſelfe, how he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat the things which were behinde, and preſſed forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the things which were before, euen towards perfection, <hi>Phil. 3. ver. 14.</hi> But yet it followeth in the ſame place, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, in that vnto which we are come, let vs procéed by one
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14667:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rule, to be like affected. Shall the ſtrong, when all are to take the iourney together, runne away, and leaue the babes and the féeble behinde them? nay, rather let them leade them by the hand, carie them in theyr armes, and vpon their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Let the <hi>Browniſts</hi> alone, who, as if they were ayrie ſpirits, diſburthened of all lumpe of the fleſh, mount vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, and leaue poore heauie loden ſinners crawling vppon the earth. The other argument by which I prooue them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Hereſie in this their ſecond accuſation, is this, Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer maketh the ſtableneſſe of Gods couenant towards his people, and with his Church, to depend vppon the works of men, he mayntayneth flat Hereſie: for albeit the words of the Couenant be theſe, <hi>I will be your God, and you ſhall be my people,</hi> which implyeth a true ſanctification required to glorifie God, and to be thankfull, yet the Couenant is wholly and altogether of mercie, yea euen of the riches of his frée grace, who hath promiſed and ſworne vnto vs to declare the ſtableneſſe of his counſell, that we might haue ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>Hebrewes 6. verſ. 17.</hi> We are ſaued by grace, and not by works, <hi>Tit. 3.</hi> As the Couenant was made vnto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> in ſome particular, ſo was it to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſéede in generall. Then thus it is written: <hi>I will make him my firſt borne, higher then the Kings of the earth. I will keepe my mercy for him for euer, and my couenant with him ſhall be ſtable. I will ſet his ſeed for euer, and his throne as the daies of heauen. If his children ſhall forſake my lawe, and not walke in my iudgements. If they ſhall prophane my Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and not obſerue my commaundements: I will viſite their defection with the rod, &amp; their iniquitie with plagues. But I will not diſanull my mercy towards him, nor falſifie my faith. I wil not prophane my couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor alter the thing which is gone out of my lips. I haue once ſworne by my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, I wil not lie vnto Dauid, Pſal. 89. v. 28.</hi> If the couenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſéede, did not ſtand after the ſame ſort ſtabliſhed vppon the frée promiſe of grace, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the oath of God, how could it be ſaid after all the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and rebellions of the Churche of Iſraell reckoned
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14667:40"/>
vp, and after hée had chaſtiſed them, that hée remembred his couenant with them, and he repented through the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his compaſſions, if it be ſayd, they repented, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned agayne into couenant with him, and obteyned mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. I anſwere, they repent not but by his mercie and grace which he beſtowed vpon them, becauſe they were within his couenant. Now the <hi>Browniſts</hi> in affirming that by open groſſe ſinne committed by any, if they remayne ſtill in the Church, the couenant is not only diſanulled to them, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that doo communicate with them, and ſo make the ſtableneſſe of Gods couenant, not to depend vpon mercie and frée grace promiſed and bound with an oth, but vppon our works, yea, and in a more tickle eſtate, euen vppon the woorkes of other whome we muſt iudge. Therefore the <hi>Browniſts</hi> mayntayne verie wicked hereſie, when they crye out, that thoſe aſſemblyes where any open ſinners are not caſt foorth, they be no longer the true Church of God, but the Couenant is diſanulled with them all that doo ioyne together in that ſocietie. I might héere make an ende tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this ſecond principall tranſgreſſion, but that there bée certayne particular reaſons, by which they ſtand to mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne theyr opinion. Firſt, to this effect many doo ſpeake. If there be wicked men ſuffered to come to the Table of the Lord, the Miniſter and Eccleſiaſticall Gouernours doo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo grieuous a ſinne, that they can not but be vtterly voyde of the true feare of God. Then, he which is a wicked man, can not be a Miniſter of Chriſt, and béeing no Miniſter of Chriſt, there is no Sacrament of Chriſt deliuered, how then ſhall a man communicate with that aſſemblie? I haue ſhewed before, that there be great ſinnes and great neglect of dutie oftentimes where there is the true faith in weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo they ſinne damnablie, which take vppon them to iudge them no Chriſtians. The faithfull in <hi>Corinth</hi> were blinded in theyr owne faults, and verie ſecurely did the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Gouernours ſuffer the inceſtuous perſon to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue among them. And whereas they ſay, that if the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14667:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be vngodly, he can be no Miniſter of Chriſt, it is falſe: for the man touching his owne perſon may be a reprobate, and yet touching his miniſterie, a Miniſter of Chriſt. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a Miniſter of Chriſt, and baptized, <hi>Iohn. 4. ver. 2.</hi> they were as truly and effectually baptized by him, as by <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet in himſelfe a Deuill, <hi>Iohn. 6. verſ. 70.</hi> The two Sonnes of Ely were horrible wicked men, <hi>1. Sam. 2. ver. 12. 22.</hi> and yet they are called not only Prieſts, but Prieſts of the Lord, <hi>1. Sam. 1. verſ. 3. Ely</hi> himſelfe did offend, and was ſharply puniſhed, that being not only their Father, but alſo high Prieſt and Iudge, he did not put them from the dignitie of the Office, but did honour them with the ſame, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Gods honour, <hi>1. Sam. 2. verſ. 29.</hi> The Scribes and Phariſies who were not all of the Sonnes of <hi>Leuy,</hi> for Saint <hi>Paule</hi> was a Phariſie, and the Sonne of a Phariſie, but yet of the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> were Miniſters of the Church, for Chriſt ſayth, They ſate in Moyſes Chayre, and willed men to heare them, notwithſtanding, they were blinde guides, hypocrites, prowde, couetous, ambitious, and verie reprobates, <hi>Matth. 23.</hi> Then, next they alleadge, that a little leauen doth leauen the whole lumpe, <hi>1. Cor. 5.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where one open notorious Sinner is admitted to be a member of the Church, all are leauened and polluted, all doo fall from God. I aunſwere, that Saint <hi>Paule</hi> rebuketh the <hi>Corinthes,</hi> that they were puffed vp, and did glorie when they ſhould haue ſorrowed: for as many as had the power of the Diſcipline in theyr hands, and did neglect, were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his ſinne, and not only they, but of priuate mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, all that did not mourne and lament to ſée ſuch a foule matter wincked at. As the Lord himſelfe doth cléere all thoſe which mourned for the abhominations of <hi>Ieruſalem, Ezechiel. 9.</hi> ſo were they frée and not leauened, which did mourne at <hi>Corinth</hi> for ſuch abuſes. Moreouer, it is verie falſe to ſay, that whole Church was leauened, or polluted with the ſinne of that wicked man, therefore they were not the Church of God. For béeing giltie not only in that fault,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14667:41"/>
but in many other, hée giueth them the honour of Gods Church, writing to the Church of God which is at <hi>Corinth, 1. Corinth. 1.</hi> Then are obiected the words and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lord by Saint <hi>Paule: If any that is called a brother be a fornicator, or couetouſe, or an Idolater, or a rayler, or a drunckard, or an extortioner, with ſuch ſee that yee eate not, 1. Cor. 5.</hi> Some hold, that this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is giuen only againſt the eating with an open ſinner at the Lords Table, ſéeing we may eate common bread with ſuch as be verie wicked. Others doo argue thus: If it be not lawfull to eate common bread with a wicked man, how much more vnlawfull ſhall it be to eate with him that holie bread of the Lords Table? as the Anabaptiſts lighting vpon theſe words of our Sauiour Chriſt, but I ſay vnto ye, Sweare not at all, <hi>Matth. 5.</hi> do gather, that it is vtterlie vnlawfull in any reſpect or at any time to take an oath, and erre, in not conſidering the circumſtances whereby the words vttered in generall, are to be reſtrayned vnto the particular abuſe, and raſh ſwearing. Euen ſo the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> taking the words as they ſtand, and not waying the circumſtances, doo mayntayne abſurdities. They drawe theyr Argument of compariſon from things in which the ſinne or pollution is not: for the ſinne is not in the eating of the common bread, neyther in eating the bread of the Lord with the wicked, but in circumſtances. For I may eate bread with open ſinners, and offend thereby, and I may eate bread with notorious wicked men, and not offend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, yea, I may grieuouſly ſinne, in refuſing to eate with them. I will expreſſe how. If there be open groſſe offenders, and my familiaritie with them, or my eating with them, can not be, but I ſhall eyther be partaker of their ſinne, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and harden them in the ſame, I offend, if I doo not ſhunne their companie. If any brother in the Church be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uict of foule ſinne, found obſtinate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo Excommunicate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery member of the Church euen by the commaundement of God, is to haue no fellowſhip with him, that he may be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14667:41"/>
                  <hi>2. Theſ. 3. v. 14.</hi> But yet we are willed in the ſame place, not to account him as an enimie, but to admoniſh him as a Brother. For if men ſhould now in familiaritie, receiue him to their table, or go to his table, it would harden him in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie, and bring the cenſure and power of the Church into contempt. This is that S. <hi>Paul</hi> dealeth about. The wife of this man, his children, and ſeruants may eate with him, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye other, where it cannot be eſchewed, for then it dooth not countenance him. Now if I be in a ſhip vpon the ſea, among a company of vild wicked men, or in a priſon, or in an armie, and can haue no meate, vnleſſe I eate with them, if I refuſe, I famiſh my ſelfe to death, and ſo offend gréeuouſlie. We ſée then it is not the very eating with them that dooth defile, but the circumſtances. Euen ſo is it at the Lordes table, where wicked men be admitted. For ſuch as doo admit them, hauing power to repell, do offend in eating there with them, becauſe they countenance them in their ſinne. But nowe a priuate member which is gréeued at this, and dooth what lyeth in him to haue it redreſſed, dooth not offend, nor is not polluted by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with them. But as he, that among the wicked in the ſhip, in the priſon, or in the Campe, doth offend in refuſing his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely ſuſtenance: ſo ſhall he, if he refuſe that heauenly foode of his ſoule, for all the wicked cannot corrupt the ſame vnto him.</p>
               <p>This man hath no fellowſhip with the vnfrutefull works of darkeneſſe. This man dooth obey the Commaundement, come out from among them, ſeparate your ſelues, and touch no vncleane thing, &amp;c. For he toucheth not their ſinne, but the holy things of God: for the ſeperation from the wicked, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be alwaies in body. Where there is idolatrie practiſed, and the faith and true worſhip ouerthrowne, we muſt depart both in minde and bodye: but from wicked men in the Church, we cannot depart in bodye, vnleſſe we will alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If it were otherwiſe, how ſhould the faithfull, without pollution, worſhip as they did in the Temple, among ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prophane men? and how ſhould thoſe few at <hi>Sardi, Reuel. 3</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:14667:42"/>
haue kept their garments vnpolluted, among that heape of vngodly men? Now let the reader iudge, whether I haue in a frantike manner, as you accuſe me, blaſphemed the name of Chriſt, by comparing yée vnto Anabaptiſts, and Donatiſts, in this your condemning and forſaking the Church for the euil men which be in it. I would to God both you and others could conſider that which is written of King <hi>Saul,</hi> when as the holy Ghoſt ſaith, he was zealous for the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, 2 Samuel. 21.</hi> and would roote out the <hi>Gybeonites.</hi> Did not the Lorde declare by the thrée yeares famine, and by cauſing ſome of the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> to be hanged, how curſſed his cruell zeale was, which yet hee had ſome colour of from the lawe, which willed them to roote out the Heathen? The cruell zeale of <hi>Browniſts,</hi> which ſéemeth to bee for the Church, is more without excuſe, when they will néedes roote vp the naturall plants, as now they may be called, yea euen the whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, both old and yoong.</p>

Indéed if we will admit falſe accuſations, and hereticall opinions, for reaſons, then haue yée ſaid ſomewhat, for in them yée are prompt and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull. The ſhame yée ſpeake of, that I am like to ſuſtaine by mine aunſwers, I doo not feare at all. It appeareth plainely by your words, it dooth not pleaſe yée, that yée are not encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in diſputation by ſome famous learned men, ſo deſirous yée are of that glory. But is it méete, or is there any reaſon, that preſumptuous, bold, and raſh ignorance, ſhould not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred but with great learning: Sophiſters, nay poore arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Huſbandmen, are the eueneſt matches to diſpute with yée? If I had counſelled with my learned brethren, yée ſay, they would haue counſelled me not to write. You haue put on the Lions ſkinne, and ſo imagine, that all the learned doo tremble at yée, and the truth is, they haue eſpied your long eares: (But rather to haue vſed my diſcretion in the Pulpit, as they doo, where wee may ſaye what wee luſt without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulement, for they conſider an euill matter is to bee raked in,) &amp;c. If I did not know the contrary, yée are ſo confident in your ſpéeches, that I ſhould almoſt beléeue yée. But now that I know, as ſure as anye thing may be knowne, that you doo impudently ſlaunder and belie the learned, who though they diſdaine to deale with mad frenſie, yet they like well, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the poore people which are ready to be ſeduced, that your matters ſhould be aunſwered, how will yee perſwade me, or others, that yée are not without care what yée ſpeake? And if there be any ſparke of modeſtie leaft in yée, I will not ſay, make ſome due proofe, but euen a colourable ſhew, that the learned of this land, if I had conferred with them, would haue giuen that counſell vnto me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which you affirme, and for that cauſe which you mention. Now come your reaſons, you are perſwaded by the worde of God, that a true miniſter of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:14667:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Chriſt, cannot be a miniſter of idolatrous and falſe worſhip. Yee are rightly perſwaded, and I am fully of your minde in this point. But where yée ſay ye haue prooued our worſhip to be ſuch, therein yée faile, for ye haue falſely accuſed, but not prooued. Then yee were alſo perſwaded by the word of God, that a true Paſtor cannot ſtand an heard to the Lords Goates and Swine, bleſſing them with the bleſſing of the faithfull, and deliuering to them the holy things of God, as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. I haue ſhewed alſo in that your ſecond accuſation, how preſumptuouſly and heretically yée haue dealt, in iudging Chriſtian men to be Heathen and Swine. In this third accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, your reaſon is in the word impoſed. That miniſterie which is impoſed vpon the flockes, is Antichriſtian, becauſe they be not fréely choſen by the Lords faithfull people, &amp;c. But the Miniſtrie of the Church of England is impoſed, &amp;c. I take exception againſt both the propoſition and aſſumption of this argument. For the propoſition, albeit the impoſing of a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter vpon the flocke, may carry an iniurie to the Church depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of hir priuiledge and right: yet it dooth not followe, that the ſame miniſter or his miniſtery is Antichriſtian. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour in the place ye alledge, <hi>Iohn. 10.</hi> ſpeaketh onely of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes and falſe Prophets, which clime ouer into the ſhéepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, he ſpeaketh not of any which lead the ſhéepe to the doore, that is to Chriſt, whether their calling to the office haue béene ſuch in all reſpects, or not as it ought to be. Secondly, if by frée choiſe of the faithfull, you meane that in the chooſing of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, the people or priuate members of the flocke are to giue their voices, or elſe the miniſter is impoſed and Antichriſtian: then doo yée condemne all the Miniſters of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua,</hi> and other Churches. For they are not choſen by the voices of the people, neither doe they hold that way the moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, for the people to declare their conſent, but rather theyr ſilence, as yée may ſée in diuerſe Epiſtles of Maiſter <hi>Beza,</hi> and namely in the laſt. But when a flocke is deſtitute of a Paſtor, their choiſe is after this ſort: The Prebyterie or Senate of Paſtors and Teachers, doo examine and make triall, and chooſe him whome they ſhall finde euery way qualified for ſo
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:14667:43"/>
worthy a function. The matter being made knowne to as many as may be, and eſpecially to that flocke ouer which he is to be ſet, that if any can alleadge iuſt cauſe why he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of ſuch an office, they be heard, otherwiſe after a due kind he is ordeyned and put into poſſeſſion of his Miniſterie. Then touching your aſſumption, the Miniſters of the Church of England (as ye ſay) be impoſed: If ye vnderſtand by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that they be all thruſt vppon the flockes againſt theyr will and liking, or that the flockes haue no power to take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, yee ſpeake vntruly. For there be many flockes in England, which haue thoſe Paſtors and Miniſters of the Goſpell whome they haue deſired to haue, and made choyſe of, I meane by ſuite, both to the Patrones, and to the parties whome they deſire to haue: and if any of the people can ſhew iuſt cauſe againſt the partie which is to be ordeined, the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop may not admit him. There follow now many boaſting words, with which yee march in tryumph, it is pitie to put them out of their array. You require one reaſon at the leaſt to confirme our Miniſterie: I confeſſe it is a reaſonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, but firſt, I muſt anſwere that which ye bring for to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe it. To proue our Miniſterie not to be of Chriſt, but to haue his negatiue: Yée ſay, yée finde not in his Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the names we carry, the offices we beare, the manner of our entrance and adminiſtration, our ſupport and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Touching our names, we are called Miniſters of the Goſpell, Paſtors, and Teachers, which be the Tytles giuen in Gods word. The names of Parſons and Vicars, are not to make any diſtinction of the Miniſterie, but of the ſtate of maintenance annexed vnto the ſame. The Offices we beare, are to teach and inſtruct our flockes by the wholeſome word of God, to adminiſter the Sacraments, and to make publike prayers. And I am ſure, theſe are preſcribed in Chriſtes Teſtament, and if your eye were not malignant, yee might eſpy them there. Our entrance is not by intruſion, but by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and that in many, by the deſire of the flockes, as I haue ſhewed before: and for the manner of our adminiſtration, it hath béen dealt in at large in the firſt accuſation. Our ſupport
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:14667:44"/>
by Tythes and ſuch like, is not mayntayned as a matter of neceſſitie, but as the moſt conuenient. The word of God hath giuen the generall rule, that the Miniſter of the word is to be liberally mayntayned: the manner touching circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, is to be ordered for moſt conueniencie by the Church, and power of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate. For many things are lawfull, and in the power of the Church to ordeyne, which are not particularly named in Gods word, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in generall rules. Your next words are farre ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and cut more déepely, yea, euen ſo déepely, that wo bée vnto vs all, if you haue not the venemous toong of liers and falſe accuſers. Yée vſe a gradation to ſet foorth our pedigrée, for we are (yée ſay) the children of the Byſhops: The By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are the creatures of the Pope: The Pope is the eldeſt ſonne of Satan, and his vicar generall in earth. Now, as yée haue ſet vs héere vnder a verie honorable parentage, ſo doo yée ſhewe vs great kindneſſe, in ſetting vs foorth not to be degenerate, but to beare the image, the marke, the power and life of the Pope: and together with him, to growe, liue, raigne, ſtand, and fall, as the branches with the trée. Héere is the verie bottome of your gall, héere is your poyſoned ſting thruſt as déepe as is poſſible. But let your words be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and by the ſtepps that you aſcend, I will deſcend. The higheſt is the Deuill, the father of lyes: Next vnto him, the Pope his eldeſt ſonne, and vicar generall in earth. In déede I am reſolutely perſwaded, that the Pope is the Beaſt, vnto whome the Dragon gaue his power, his Throne, and great authoritie, <hi>Reuel. 13.</hi> of whome it is ſayd in the ſame place, that all the world wondred and followed the Beaſt. They worſhipped the Dragon which gaue power to the Beaſt, and they woorſhipped the Beaſt, ſaying: Who is like to the Beaſt, who is able to warre with him? This no doubt is that man of ſinne, who hath exalted himſelfe aboue all that is called God, or that hath imperiall maieſtie, ſitting in the Temple of God, and boaſting himſelfe as God: whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſhould be by the effectuall working of Satan, with all lying ſignes and wonders, <hi>2. Theſſ. 2.</hi> He hath ſet vp the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14667:44"/>
worſhip of Deuils, with all abhominable Idolatrie, and blaſphemous hereſies and lyes. He hath not only vſurped and challenged a ciuill power and Lordſhip ouer Kings, but alſo a ſpirituall Dominion ouer the conſciences and faith of man, to make Lawes at his pleaſure contrarie to Gods word, to binde the ſame: this is the vicar generall of the Deuill. Then to come to the next ſteppe, where there is no queſtion nor doubt neyther to be made, but that all Popiſh Byſhops be the creatures and children of the Pope, in as much as they haue their calling, and conſecration, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer deriued from him; in as much as they ſweare obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto him, to mayntayne his dignitie, his tyrannie, his doctrine, and his lawes: and in as much as they challenge together with him a Lordſhip and tyrannie ouer the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But the Byſhops of the Church of England haue not their calling, conſecration, or power fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Church, which hath forſaken the Church of Rome, as the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagog of Satan. The Byſhops of England acknowledge no ſubiection to the Pope, but by an oath renounce his vſurped power &amp; tyranny. The Biſhops of Engl. are not ordeined to maintain or defend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> religion &amp; lawes of Antichriſt, but quite contrary, they promiſe and profeſſe to aduance the Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; by the liuely word, to cut downe all idolatrie, hereſies, and popiſh abhominations. Finally, the Biſhops of Engl. do not vſurp a Lordſhip ouer the faith &amp; conſciences of men; for the power which they haue peculiar in the Church, is only in the adminiſtration of externall gouernment. It is therfore with manifeſt &amp; wicked ſclander, that ye tearme the Biſh. of Engl. Antichriſtian, the creatures of the Pope, and ſuch as haue his power &amp; life in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea ſuch, as whoſoeuer is ordeined by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath his miniſtry fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Antichriſt, and from the Deuill. There is controuerſy about the ſtate &amp; gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by Biſhops, whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Engl. hath not erred in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting into their hands the execution of diſcipline, which is the matter to be handled in your fourth accuſation: but to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from hence a pedegrée from the Pope, is verie fooliſhe. Let vs come then to the loweſt ſtep, which is in the miniſters.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:14667:45"/>
We haue laboured in ſtudie of holie things, to be fitte for the Miniſterie, and ſo furniſhed and inſtructed to the Kingdome of Heauen, as to be lyke Houſeholders that bring out of theyr Treaſures things new and old. We deſire to call men that wander in ignorance and ſinne, vnto the light, and ſo to build the Church of Chriſt. We know, no man is to be Iudge of his owne ſufficiencie, nor to intrude himſelfe into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like office, but to be tryed and ordeyned by the Church which hath that power committed into her hands from Chriſt. The ſupreme Magiſtrate, and Church of England haue committed this truſt vnto the Byſhops, iudging it the quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and ſafeſt way. We are preſented vnto them to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and tryed, to be ordeyned and put into poſſeſſion of our Miniſterie by them, and from them to receyue the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to execute the ſame, not as theirs, but the Churches, which hath put it into their hands. It is the ordinance of God, and not the deuice of Antichriſt, that Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ſhall be tryed and ordeyned by Elders, Paſtors, and Gouernours, and ſet ouer his people. We receyue only this Ordinance, and ſuch as haue any vnderſtanding may ſée, that the queſtion can not be whether the power it ſelfe bée from Antichriſt, but whether there be not error and defects in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring the ſame, to the hurt and dammage of the Church? Now further, hauing receyued this authoritie, we Preach the holie Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, and by the pure doctrine of the ſame, we conuince and ouerthrowe Idolatrie, ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Hereſies. We correct and reprooue all manner of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, informe and exhort vnto true Godlines. In performing theſe things, we drawe men out of Poperie, by letting them vnderſtand, that the worſhip of Poperie, is the verie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Deuils, and that the Pope is Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>This Romane Antichriſt and his adherents doo féele, that the miniſterie of the Goſpell in England doth deſtroy hys kingdome, and therfore ſtirred vp by the Deuil they rage, and by all diueliſh meanes, ſéeke to deſtroy our noble Quéene and Countrie. Except therefore you <hi>Browniſts</hi> had euen let looſe all the raynes of your toong, and after a ſhameleſſe manner
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:14667:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to lie and ſlaunder, how could ye pronounce, that the miniſtery of England is Antichriſtian, and of the Deuill? or that it is in the life and power of the beaſt, to liue, to raigne, to ſtand, to fall together with him, as the branches with the trée? In the next place, yée haue whet &amp; filed your cankered toong, to vtter verye vile reproche, againſt the nurſeries of all good learning and holy religion within this land, the two Vniuerſities. I know not how idlely, and in what heathen vanitie yée ſpent your time there your ſelues: but this I dare avow, and make the challenge, and let triall be made, I will beare the ſhame for euer if it be not found true: that there be many in the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſities, and not aboue the degrée of Bachelour of Arts, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome the principall Maiſters of <hi>Browniſme</hi> are inferior: if wee reſpect either the Liberall Artes, or the knowledge of toongs, as of Hebrew, Gréeke, and Latine, or a ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Diuinitie. If this can be attained in fewe yeares, with more then Moonkiſh idleneſſe, the <hi>Browniſts</hi> may in ſome thing be beléeued. Some do abuſe the liberall Arts: but to condemne Logike, Rhethorike, and the reſt as vaine and curious, as you doo, is a very beaſtly error. Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> from whom yée draw your phraſe of ſpéech, <hi>Act. 19.</hi> dooth not ſpeake of theſe, but of Magicall ſcience. I doo not maruaile, that blind Schiſmatikes doo ſo bitterly iuueigh againſt learning, ſéeing it is their bane. For they ſéeke victorie, triumphe, and glorye ouer all the learnedeſt, and if there were no learning to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and to lay open their nakedneſſe and ſhame, they would much preuaile, and be had in greater reputation. Thus do the Browniſts labour to bring in ſauage barbariſme. But yet héere, vp goeth your ſaile againe, and yée haue winde at will, and neuer ſo much ſea roome, as when with bitter ſlaunders and reproches yée rowle away. Ye wrappe vp altogether for the offences of ſome. Yée reckon vp certaine things of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and in themſelues indifferent and yet vpon your credit we muſt take them to be odious enormities. Ye are vp with <hi>perfidi,</hi> tyrannie, and the ſtatutes of Omry. Your frenſie is great, I did aduiſe, that men would ſuſpend their iudgement, and enquire of the Churches touching the Miniſterie of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:14667:46"/>
Againſt this yée crie out, and aſke, if it be the beſt counſell I can giue them? I anſwer, it is the beſt, being that which God hath ordeined. Haue yée not read, that the Préeſts lippes ſhall kéepe knowledge, men ſhall enquire at his mouth, for he is the Angell of the Lord of Hoſtes? By this it is cléere, that whenſoeuer Heretikes and Schiſmatikes doo raiſe doubts, it is Gods will that the people ſhall enquire for reſolution out of the word, at their mouthes whome he hath raiſed vp, and ſet as the greateſt lights in his Church. Yet ſée how ſottiſhly you cauill againſt this. Yée take it I would haue them doo things which they doubt off, and my wordes are but to haue them ſuſpend their iudgement, vntill they enquire, and not to be too raſh in following the call of blinde, preſumptuous, and hereticall ſchiſmatikes. Then yée ſay, I ſend them ouer the ſea we wotte not whether, &amp;c. They make doubt of vs, we are the men whoſe Miniſtery is in queſtion, we ſend them therefore vnto thoſe of whome they can haue no doubt, and that is to the worthy inſtruments and ſeruants of God, the Paſtors of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches. I do no not ſend them ouer the Seas, for there be diuerſe godly Churches of ſtrangers within the land, as the French, the Dutch, the Italian: there be the churches of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and no ſea to paſſe, nor diuerſitie of language ſo great as to hinder: we haue alſo the writings of all the worthieſt. Yée ſay I ſend them vnto the word of man: which is falſe, for I doo ſend them vnto the learned paſtors, to be reſolued by the word of God. Theſe haue the calling vnto this office from God, and his bleſſing vpon thoſe which ſéeke it with humility and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. It is not to vſe old popiſh worne arguments, but yours is the courſe of all arrogant proud heretikes &amp; ſchiſmatikes, which couet to draw the people to depend vpon them, that they may haue fame, &amp; to forſake their Paſtors, which take it grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly, that they ſhould ſéeke reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any where but at their hand. Whether ſhall we iudge the godly learned miniſters of the Churches aboue named, which haue their calling from God, or the vnlearned &amp; raſh <hi>Browniſts,</hi> intruding themſelues without calling, and run before they be ſent, fitteſt to enquire at for reſolution? It were a pretie thing, to heare the Harlots
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:14667:46"/>
in the ſtewes, euen in good earneſt to boaſt and glory of their chaſtitie. Who is more fierce and outragious, more vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in condemning, then yée <hi>Browniſts?</hi> And yet ye bragge of ſuch patience and charitie, as cannot be ouercome. Then yée turne your ſelues to thoſe poore ſoules as yée terme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whom we, like miſerable Phyſicians ſéeke to cure: and your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell you giue them. I doo allow it, for it is the ſame in effect, if you could ſée, that I gaue them before. I would to God the people did follow it: we ſhould not then haue one <hi>Browniſt,</hi> The Deuill counterfaiting Chriſts voice, in hereticall ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes, ſhould not be able to allure and call away the ſhéepe from their ſhéepeheards. Now remaineth the laſt point one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I ſhew ſome reaſon to prooue our Miniſtery to be of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The miniſtery of the Goſpell, which bringeth the worde of faith and reconciliation betwéene God and the worlde, is the true miniſterie of Chriſt, for the Deuil and Antichriſt ordeine no ſuch miniſterie. Nowe the miniſterie of the Church of England, doth bring no word nor doctrine, but the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. It preacheth faith in God through Chriſt, and the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of repentance, deliuering the holy ſacraments, as ſeales to confirme the ſame. Let all the ſchiſmatikes in the world barke againſt it, and ſay we haue no word nor Sacraments: yet this is the holy word: <hi>God ſo loued the world, that hee gaue his onely begotten ſonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not periſh, but haue life euerlaſting.</hi> It may be ſayde, that many miniſters in England, doo not, nor cannot preach the Goſpell, how then is their miniſtery the miniſtery of reconciliation? Héere note, that as we muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the miniſtery and the man himſelfe which is the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: for the man may be of the Deuill, and yet his miniſtery of God: ſo muſt we alſo diſtinguiſh betwéene the function it ſelfe, and the execution of the ſame. For when one is called to bee a miniſter of the Goſpell, which is able, and dooth not preach, the defect is not in the function, but in his negligence about the execution. Likewiſe when the office or function is layd vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him that cannot preach, the function it ſelfe is entyre,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14667:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the defect is in the execution thereof, through his diſabilitie. I ſay therfore, that the Miniſterie of England is the Miniſterie of the Goſpell, though ſome doo not, and ſome cannot Preach. Then further, ſuch as haue the calling and ordination of the Church, haue the Miniſterie of Chriſt: for it is giuen to the Church, to haue power to call and ordeine Miniſters. Now if the Church doo falt and breake, either by error or negligence, in ſome rules which are to be obſerued about this calling and ordinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet the power is not diſanulled, nor the function de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, vnleſſe we will hold, that where there is tranſgreſſion either of ignorance, or otherwiſe, the whole is ouerthrowne: and ſo conclude, that there is no praier nor worſhip of God, nor any true ſeruice doone vnto him vnder heauen, becauſe all is with errors and faults.</p>
               <p>In England the Miniſters haue their calling and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Church of God. For that people which hath forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hereſies, and falſe worſhip, and imbraced the doctrine of the Goſpell, hath in it the true Church, which hath the power. And the Miniſters intrude not themſelues, but haue the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er giuen them by the hands of the Biſhops, who doo it not by their owne authoritie, nor by any authoritie from Antichriſt, but as committed to their truſt by publike authoritie. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that is the Miniſterie of God, which is to bring men to the faith, and to build vp the body of Chriſt. The Miniſterie of England is to none other end. For the whole drift, the whole ſcope, and burthen laid vpon them, is to féede with wholſome doctrine, and to guide in the waye of godlineſſe, the ſhéepe of Chriſt, walking before them in godlye conuerſation. The <hi>Browniſt</hi> will not take himſelfe héere conuinced, but will ſay, theſe cauſes are but pretended, and are not in truth. I will therefore now reaſon from the effect, together with that which is properly adioyned to the Miniſterie of Chriſt. That Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, with the execution whereof there is ioyned the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace, power, bleſſing, and operation of the Holy-ghoſt, to the true conuerſion of mens ſoules, is not a Miniſterie of the Deuill, nor of Antichtiſt, nor commeth not in the life and power of the beaſt, but is indeed the true Miniſterie of Chriſt.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14667:47"/>
I thinke the <hi>Browniſts</hi> will not be ſo beaſtly as to affyrme that the grace and operation of the holy Ghoſt to the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of mens ſoules, is ioyned to that, and worketh by that which is of the Deuill, and commeth in the life and power of Antichriſt. Then it remayneth only, to ſhewe that there hath béene and is this grace and worke in the execution of our function. If the <hi>Browniſts</hi> will deny that euer they felt that maieſtie and power in the preaching, which can not be in the words of man, but only in that word which is ſharper then any two edged ſword, and pierceth ſo déepe, as to be a diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the thoughts and ſecret intents. Or if they will denie that euer they haue béene driuen by it vnto hatred, ſorrowe, and remorſe for ſinne, and rayſed vp with comfort and hope of forgiueneſſe, and with the promiſes of eternall glorie: Yet vnto many other which by it are conuerted vnto the Lord in déede, which vnto feare and trembling doo féele the power and ſwéetneſſe of the liuely word, it may be ſayd, as <hi>S. Paule</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the <hi>Corinths:</hi> for when his aduerſaries did denie him to be an Apoſtle, the <hi>Corinths</hi> by his Miniſterie were begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Chriſt: wherevpon he ſayth, If I be not an Apoſtle vnto others, yet am I vnto you, for you are the ſeale of mine Apoſtleſhip in the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>1. Cor. 9. ver. 2.</hi> Euen ſo, if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, be not the Miniſtery of Chriſt vnto others, yet you can not doubt of it: your faith, your repentance, your ioy in the Lord, are the ſeale of it. You can not but ſée and knowe, that they be vile blaſphemous wretches, which beare ye in hand, that it is not the word of God, nor the grace of his ſpirit which worketh in ye, but the power of the Deuill, and the ſpirit of Antichriſt. You knowe it is the direct way which the Deuill taketh by his miniſters to bring in flat Atheiſme, to diſgrace and throwe downe the credite of the miniſterie. But doth it not make againſt the Miniſterie of England, that many of the <hi>Browniſts</hi> confeſſe they haue béene greatly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at ſometimes with the power of the preaching, and at the adminiſtration of the Sacraments? for may it not bée ſayd héerevpon, that it is but a deceyuable ſhewe of grace and power, for if it had béene in truth, it would haue continued?
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:14667:48"/>
I anſwer, it is ſufficient to proue the Miniſterie, and that the power of the holy Ghoſt goeth with it, when men haue bin ſo moued, although they do not continue, ſéeing the reprobate do féele the power, and taſte the ſwéetnes of the word for a time, <hi>Hebr. 6.</hi> He that hath therefore felt the power of God in his ſoule by the preaching of the word, and now doth not, the falt is in himſelfe. If the <hi>Brow.</hi> do further reply, that they be not true Chriſtians which yet are moued by the preaching, the motions are deceiptfull. Then I wil fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, ſhew that ſuch people are truly faithfull. For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that they were bleſſed and holy Martyrs that ſuffred in the dayes of Quéene <hi>Mary:</hi> and I ſay they were conuerted by the ſame miniſterie which we haue now. They had but the ſame motions at the preaching of <hi>Latimer, Howper, Taylor, Bradford,</hi> and others, which our people haue nowe. If the people at this day then féele the ſame effect in their ſoules at the preaching and Sacraments, touching faith, repentance, and reſolution to dye with ioy for the teſtimonie of the Lord if he ſhall require it, let the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> and all other wicked Sciſmatikes barke that we haue no Miniſterie, we haue no Word, we haue no Sacraments, nor true Church, yet the godly wiſe ſhall be able to diſcerne the voyce of Chriſt from the voyce of the Deuill, and perceyue that the power of our Miniſterie is not of the Deuill, but of the holy Ghoſt, whom they haue moſt wickedly reproched.</p>

               <p>To this fourth accuſation, my anſwere was very ſhort:<note place="margin">G.

At this ye are ſtriken with ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment, that as men caried almoſt beſide your ſelues, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with a vehement exclamation: and thrée things there are in my ſpéech which haue caſt ye into this agonie: the firſt, that (as you ſay) our Churches ſtand vnder an apparant heauie yoke of Antichriſt, and I ſpeake of the true Church oppreſſed with ſome yoke of Antichriſtian gouernment: the ſecond, that I ſay it is the lot of the Church to be oppreſſed with outward bondage. This ye tearme a blaſphemous error, becauſe as ye ſay, bondage is the badge of Antichriſt, the marke of the Beaſt, whereby his ſouldiers are diſcerned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſouldiers of Chriſt, &amp;c. The third, that I falſifie &amp; peruert the places of Scripture which I alleadge to prooue that Gods Church may be oppreſſed with ſome outward bondage: where you will redéeme the places from ſuch violence and corruption, and giue ſuch a glimſe, that ſimple men of vnderſtanding ſhall diſcouer and ſearch out the falſe dealing of ſuch watchmen, and the greateſt clarke of vs all ſhal be taught héereafter how
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14667:49"/>
to abuſe the ſcripture for a cloake to couer our ſinnes. O what valiant fellowes you be, who ſhall be able to ſtand in your hands? the greateſt clarks in this land are but babes to ſuch mighty gyants: how ſhall I do then? I muſt now defend my ſelf in theſe particulars aboue named. I will let the queſtion about the heauy apparant yoake of Antichriſt alone, vnto the laſt place, vnder which ye falſely charge our Church to ſtand, and deale with that firſt which I ſet downe. Where the firſt queſtion is, whether the true ſpouſe of Chriſt may be vnder ſome yoake of Antichriſtian gouernment. The ſecond, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be her lot to be oppreſſed with outward bondage. The third, whether thoſe places by me alleadged be rightly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to proue the ſame. I will not deale ſeuerally in theſe, but in all together, becauſe they be all but one in effect. Now to ſpeake preciſely and ſtrictly, the yoke of Antichriſt is only ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall &amp; inward, where the faith &amp; conſcience are burthened, and be in ſubiection, to receiue his lawes and worſhip. This can not be borne, without falling from the fréedome we haue in Chriſt. But in a longer ſenſe, we call it Antichriſtian, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the paſtors of the Church, or any of them, do vſurp more then they ought, in external gouernment, or tyrannouſly abuſe the power committed into their hands. This is that which I cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſome Antichriſtian yoke. Now the very point of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, whether the true ſpouſe of Chriſt hath euer béen op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in this by any of her gouernours, as her lot in ſome outward bondage? I hold that ſhe hath, and for proofe, I allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thoſe ſayings out of the Song, againſt which you take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as places wreſted, which ſhall be conſidered, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other teſtimonies ſhewed. Then I demaund of ye firſt, whether it was not the ſpouſe of Chriſt, whom the Lord cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Iſraell, his ſhéepe and his flocke? The paſtors of Iſraell did not only ſcatter theſe, but ruled ouer them, and exerciſed dominion by violence &amp; tyranny, <hi>Ezech. 34. v. 4.</hi> What ſay ye to this, the Prophets propheſie lies, the Prieſts exerciſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their hand, &amp; my people loue to haue it ſo, <hi>Ier. 5. v. 31.</hi> Was there no true Church vnder this ruling of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſts?

put him in the ſtockes, <hi>Ierem. 20. ver. 1.</hi> will yée affirme that there was no true Church then? Come to the time in which our Sauiour liued vpon the earth: for as yet the kingdome of God was not taken away from them, which is threatned, <hi>Matth. 22:</hi> but the high Préeſt, with the other Préeſts, with the Phariſies and Elders of the people, had the Eccleſiaſticall power, which they tyrannouſly abuſed, and by it oppreſſed the faithfull, as appeareth in diuerſe places of the Goſpell, and namely in <hi>Iohn. 7. ver. 13.</hi> and <hi>Iohn. 9. ver. 22.

Did he will them to ſeperate themſelues, and not to obey him any longer in any thing? Our Sauiour ſaith, the time will come, that they ſhall excommunicate yée. <hi>Iohn. 16. ver. 2.</hi> Antichriſt himſelfe ſitting in the Temple of God, ſeduced the reprobate, but could not deſtroy the Church, which yet he did gréeuouſly oppreſſe, and kéepe in ſome bondage. Whereby it appeareth, that <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpeaketh of that which ſhould fall out often, and be euen as it were the lot of the Church, to be iniuried, oppreſſed, and kept in ſome outward bondage, euen by thoſe, at whoſe hands ſhe ſhould finde moſt comfort, holding the places of Paſtors and Gouernours: as we haue ſéene in the Church of Iſraell before our Sauiour came, at the time he liued, and alſo in the Church vnder the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>You bring in diuerſe ſcriptures, which prooue, as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that an outward oppreſſion of the Church in externall gouernment, dooth make an vtter deuorſe betwixt her and Chriſt: but he that conſidereth thoſe things which I haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

noted, and the ſundry oppreſſions of the Church, by her Paſtors, ſhall eaſily perceiue that Anabaptiſticall fréedome which yée glory of. For howſoeuer the Church with her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are frée with God, and receiue no yoake vpon their faith and conſcience: yet in outward things they may be oppreſſed. You could abide well enough that phraſe of ſpéech oppreſſed, but to ſay, the Church of Chriſt may be in anye bondage, yée terme a blaſphemous error. Becauſe bondage yée ſay, is the badge of Antichriſt, the marke of the Beaſt, &amp;c. Take héede of the ſaying that is written, <hi>2. Pet. 2. ver. 19. That the ſeducers promiſe libertie, and are themſelues the bend ſeruants of corruption.</hi> For you imagine and glorye of ſuch a full and perfect libertie, as that yée account it a blaſphemous error, to ſay the Church may be oppreſſed with outward bondage. It is ſtrange that there ſhould be ſuch a bolde ſpirite in rotten fleſh, as flatly to contrary the ſpirit of God. For the Lord ſayd to <hi>Abraham: Thy ſeede ſhall bee in bondage, and they ſhall oppreſſe them.

queſtion is about Church gouernment, and I ſpeake of ciuill bondage: for ye ſpeake generally of outward bondage, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie that it can be the lot of the Church, or of any member ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The worde bondage, though it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be outward, cannot in anye ſenſe be allowed by you, to agrée with your fréedom. Now for the places in the ſong, <hi>My mothers ſonnes were angrye with me, they ſet me to keepe the Vines, mine owne Vine I haue not kept.</hi> In this place the Church willeth: firſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould not looke ſcornefully vpon her, becauſe ſhe is ſomwhat blacke. Then ſhe ſheweth, that it is not her natiue colour, but ſhe is ſunne burnt: the ſunne (ſaith ſhe) hath looked vpon me. There followeth the occaſion, that her mothers ſonnes were angrye with her, ſet her to kéepe the Vines. Who theſe be whome ſhe calleth her mothers ſonnes, is the greateſt difficultie to finde. <hi>Tremellius</hi> (whoſe interpretation in that point ye follow) doth expound it of originall ſinne, &amp; the luſts which ſhe hath fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wombe: other take it, &amp; more fitly, of falſe brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which boaſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be true worſhipers, &amp; children of the church, which ſhe calleth her mothers ſonnes, becauſe they deſcended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ancient mother church, &amp; were the degenerate children of holy forefathers, for I take it ſomwhat hard to cal ſins or concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences her mothers ſons. But take it whether way ye wil, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of original ſin &amp; concupiſcences, or of degenerate children, among whom there were many, euen of the Paſtors &amp; gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, yet ye cannot auoid, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is a violence, an oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; ſome bondage: for ſhe ſaith, they ſet her to kéep the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards. Howſoeuer you would ſlily inſinuate, that it were but negligence, &amp; that when ſhe repenteth, ſhe is ſo cléered, that ſhe is in no bondage vnto ſinne at all. But when ye haue cauilled what ye can, it ſtandeth cléere by the ſcriptures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Church in her perfecteſt repentance, euen with all her children, is held in ſome ſpirituall bondage vnto ſin, but yet ſhe is not obſtinat I grant, for ſhe hateth the euil ſhe doth, &amp; laboureth againſt it. I doe not gather from this, that the Church either did or may, kéepe Antichriſts Vine, as you demaund, what a bolde falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiyng of the place this is? But I ſaye: what a bolde impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie is this in you, ſo to falſifie my wordes?

                  </gap>bable ſo much of Antichriſt and his yoake. Then let hym prooue that euery error, abuſe, and great fault in diſcipline, doth ouerturne it, and make it become Antichriſtian, yea, Antichriſts yoake, ſo farre as to make it no Church which is ſubiect to ſuch oppreſſion. It is moſt cléere that a Church may erre in ſundrie poynts of Doctrine, and not be Antichriſtian, but the true Spouſe of Chriſt. And an error in Doctrine, if it be foule, doth approch néerer towards the ouerthrowe of faith, then an error or an abuſe in externall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if the execution of diſcipline by Byſhops be the yoake of Antichriſt, and if all the Churches which doo ſtande vnder the ſame, doo worſhip the Beaſt and be no Chriſtians, it muſt néedes followe, that ſuch as did euer execute this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, were Antichriſts, and no children of God at that time, or before they repented. But this is falſe euen by your owne confeſſion, which acknowledge, that thoſe woorthie ſeruants of God which ſometime executed that power, and after ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red death for the Goſpell in the dayes of Quéene <hi>Mary,</hi> were bleſſed Martyrs. I conclude therefore, that the <hi>Browniſts</hi> can not but with hereſies, and moſt heinous iniurie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate dealing, condemne a Church as quite diuorced and ſeparated from Chriſt, for ſuch imperfections and corruptions in Gods worſhip, as be not fundamentall, nor deſtroy the ſubſtance: for that wicked men come with the godly to the publike exerciſes of religion: for ſome wants in calling, and ordeyning Miniſters, and in Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline.</p>

               <p>Yee call it an old Popiſh reaſon that I bring of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne bleſſed Martyrs which dyed in the ſtate our Church is nowe in. If you had no more frenſie in yée then my reaſon hath Poperie, it were much better for yée. Let vs ſée howe you or any <hi>Browniſt</hi> is able to anſwere it. That Churche which is of the Deuill, and hath not the truth, but is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, can not bring foorth and nouriſh vp children to God: But the Church of England in the eſtate it is now in, brought foorth and nouriſhed vp children to God, ſéeing it yéelded many bleſſed and conſtant Martyrs: Therefore the Church of England in the eſtate it is in, hath the truth, and is not a falſe and Antichriſtian Church. When you haue ſhewed that a falſe Church can bring foorth and nouriſh vp true children to God, yée may well ſaye that this is not to prooue our Church by Chriſtes Teſtament. If yee can not prooue that, ceaſſe to cauill. Yée denye them not to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Martyrs, but yee ſay, that they dyed not in our Church, nor for our Church. Ye ſpeake confidentlie: but in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of your ſpéech, yée ſhewe your ſelues moſt fooliſhe. For yée ſay, they dyed not in our Church, béeing through Gods great mercie depriued and diſgraded by theyr enemies. All the Martyrs were depriued by theyr enemyes of theyr liues, they could not depriue them of theyr faith, nor of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14667:55"/>
truth which they had learned before from the mouthes of Gods Miniſters in our Church. What were they all diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of? doo yée take it they were all members of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog of Antichriſt, or ſtoode for any dignities or priuiledges in that fellowſhip, vntyll theyr enemyes thruſt them foorth? Then yée ſay, they dyed not for it, but for the truth of Chriſt. How will you ſeparate things as contrarye, which doo ſtand well together? they dyed both for the truth of Chriſt, and for our Church: they conſtantly gaue teſtimonie to the truth, and were content to indure any torments to confyrme theyr Bréethren in the ſame, and therein may be ſayd to dye for the Church. I doo not meane that euery thing which they allowed, muſt néedes be good, for they had theyr errors and imperfections. Neyther doo I reaſon after this ſorte, as though the Martyrs ſhould dye for euery order and obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church, they dyed for the ſubſtance of that faith and woorſhip which our Church mayntayneth. And (as I ſayd before) you muſt prooue they were not begotten to God by our Church, or elſe confeſſe our Church to bée the Spouſe of Chriſt. Doubtleſſe, if our Church did not bring them foorth, and nurſſe them vp to God, they were decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and departed out of the worlde ſuch babes, that they tooke a wrong woman for theyr Mother, for they tooke our Church to be theyr Mother. But you haue another An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, and that is, that thoſe Martyrs neuer reſiſted the truth béeing ſhewed them, nor neuer yéelded vnto any yoake or corruption which God gaue them ſight of, contrarie to theyr conſciences, as yée ſay we doo in theſe dayes. Then the difference will fall out betwéene them and vs, that they offended of ignorance, and ſtoode vnder Antichriſtes yoake, yea, ſome of them muſt be Antichriſt himſelfe, in as much as they were Byſhops, and yet Gods true Church. For, yée ſay, they were faithfull in that little light, and wée offende of knowledge, and therefore can not be the true Church.</p>
               <p>Your confeſſing them faithful in that little light, &amp; ſo Gods
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14667:56"/>
Church vnder the ſame gouernment we be, which ye tearme Antichriſts yoake, doth quite ouerthrowe all <hi>Browniſme,</hi> make what difference ye can betweene them and vs in truth, yet ſhall it appeare, that of neceſſitie graunt them to be the Church, ye muſt confeſſe ours. If ignorance excuſed them, ignorance ſhould excuſe many among vs, ſéeing there be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes in the land profeſſing the Goſpell that are perſwaded we haue the truth, and be in the right way both in doctrine and gouernment. And againe, ye are much deceiued, if ye ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that euery Chriſtian man now hath ſo great vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as the chiefe of them had that ſuffered death in the dayes of Quéene <hi>Mary.</hi> Would ye haue men beléeue, that <hi>Browne</hi> himſelfe, and thoſe <hi>Browniſts,</hi> which take themſelues his equals, haue greater light then eyther <hi>Ridley, Cranmer, Howper, Bradford, Philpot, Taylor,</hi> and other had? when the learnedeſt in theſe dayes are not aſhamed of thoſe woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie men, but acknowledge them as excellent Diuines? How abſurd a thing is it, that ignorant blinde Schiſmatikes, full of fantaſticall and hereticall opinions, ſhould boaſt of theyr great light in compariſon of theirs? Now we come to the laſt poynt of all, and one of the greateſt. I ſayd, ye muſt ſhewe that God commaundeth priuate men to ſet vp diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. As it ſtandeth ye greatly vpon, ſo ye doo apply all your force héerevnto: and in verie déede looke to it, for if ye be weake in this, and can not ſhewe good warrant, all men will ſée that your preſump ion againſt the holie ordinance of God, is moſt vile and damnable: let vs ſée then how this queſtion will be concluded. Firſt, ye ſay, God in his lawe commaundeth euery one to ſéeke the place where he putteth his name. Chriſt in the Goſpell commaundeth to ſéeke the kingdome of God, and to take his yoake vppon them, &amp;c. I aunſwere, that if a man from theſe places ſhoulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, therefore priuate men are commaunded to preach the word, and to adminiſter the Sacraments, it were ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous: and yet ye may, as well as to ſay, that therefore they are to reforme, to eſtabliſhe, or to ſet vp the diſcipline.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14667:56" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Your next reaſon is drawne from the nature of diſcipline, in that it is perpetuall. Indéed the ſubſtance, and eſſentiall forme of diſcipline are perpetuall: and there be circumſtances in it which are variable. And thus a man may reaſon: there is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline giuen by Chriſt, which is not variable: therefore the authoritie neglecting it dooth offend, and the Church hath wrong, where it is not eſtabliſhed: but to ſay, that therefore méere priuate men are to eſtabliſh it, is without anye good warrant. For when any thing is doone that ought not, or anye thing let paſſe, which ought to bee doone in the Church and common-wealth, and ſo a perpetuall commaundement of God broken: it is no warrant for priuate men to take the matter in hand, and to redreſſe. But you ſay, the Church cannot be gouerned by any other lawes or gouernement. I am of this minde, that there can be no viſible eſtabliſhed Churches, but where there are ſome rules of Chriſtes diſcipline obſerued. As if there be no Paſtors or Teachers, no flockes, no calling nor order for Preaching the word, and adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. But to ſay there is defect or want in ſome parts of diſcipline, or it is in ſome things corrupted, therefore it is no Church that is gouerned thereby, is very hereticall. Séeing the Goſpel preached, and imbraced with true and liuely faith, giueth the being to a church. Yea but true faith, ſaith the <hi>Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt,</hi> cannot be without obedience. I graunt it cannot be the Church of God, if it be wholy diſobedient, or in matters which concerne the grounds of faith and holy doctrine. I ſaye more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that one part of this obedience is, that priuate men kéepe themſelues within the limits of their calling, and doe nothing but that which Gods worde dooth warrant them to deale in. Neither ought the Church to be without this diſcipline, ſaye you. I aſſent, that ſo farre as it is perpetuall, the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want any part, or haue it corrupted, but with iniurie and damage.</p>
               <p>But your meaning extendeth further, as appeareth by your words. For God (ſay you) holdeth them all in the ſtate of eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which haue not his ſonne to raigne ouer them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And your
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14667:57"/>
marginall note is. If they haue not his Scepter of grace, they ſhall haue his Iron mace. Indéed, if a man could not haue Chriſt to raigne ouer him, nor be in the ſtate of grace, vnleſſe the diſcipline be erected, that he may be gouerned thereby, all priuate men ſhould be warranted by neceſſitie, to ſet it vp and to eſtabliſh it, if they could no where finde it already erected, where to ioyne themſelues: but haue yée not before againſt this hereſie confeſſed the truth in your reply vpon the firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, by affirming Chriſtes kingdome to extend vnto all ſuch as by true faith apprehend and confeſſe him, howſoeuer they be ſcattered, or whereſoeuer diſperſed, vpon the face of the earth? If yee had not confeſſed, yée muſt néedes be driuen thereto. For yée take it, that <hi>Browniſts</hi> are Gods Churche, And yet yée haue not eſtabliſhed the Diſcipline. If ye replye, that yée indeuour, and are letted by force, which dooth excuſe yée before God. I anſwer, that the fetters and chaines, can no faſter binde the handes and féete of <hi>Browniſts,</hi> then the handes of priuate men are bound with the bandes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the feare of God, from preſuming to take vpon them publike authoritie.</p>
               <p>And let vs ſée where that commaundement ye ſpeake of is giuen vnto priuate men, as namely, that they are willed to come together, with promiſe of direction and protection, and authority, not onely to eſtabliſh Chriſtes lawes and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among them, but faithfully to gouerne his houſe: yée doo boldly and preſumptuouſly affirme, and can ſhew no one place of Scripture for it. Yée ſay, this aſſemblie, before they be planted and eſtabliſhed in this order, conſiſteth hetherto but of particular priuate perſons, none as yet being called to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or function? Who then hath called them together? Or being all priuate, dooth their comming together make them not to be priuate? or is not the action of many priuate men aſſembled, as priuate as of one ſeuerallye by himſelfe? Did the aſſembly of <hi>Corah</hi> &amp; his companions any thing helpe the matter? Yee will chooſe Paſtors and Elders? who ſhall ordeine them? Doo yee euer reade of anye ordeined, but by
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14667:57"/>
Apoſtles, Prophets, Euangeliſts, Paſtors, Teachers, and Gouernours? Was not the power deriued at the firſt, from the extraordinarie Miniſters to the Ordinarie? If all the <hi>Browniſts</hi> in the land ſhould come together, and chooſe a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ordeine him, ſhould it make him anye more a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter indéede before God, then if all the Apprentiſes in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don taking vpon them to chooſe a Lorde Maior of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to miniſter an othe vnto him ſhould make him a Lord Mayor? The Quéens Maieſtie hath granted no ſuch authority in the Common-wealth, to the Apprentiſes: no more hath the Lord God in the Church, vnto the <hi>Browniſts.</hi> And as it is in the higher matter, ſo is their wicked preſumption more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable. But ye procéed and ſay: therefore we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that God commaundeth his faithfull Seruants, being as yet priuate men, together to build his Church, &amp;c. Yée may euen as well conclude, as in the reſt of all your hereticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. Is it not wofull, that men ſhould be drawne into moſt damnable wayes, by ſuch blinde ſeducers, which bring not ſo much as a ſhew or colour of warrant out of Gods word, to ſet them a worke in that whereof they chéefely glorye, as namely that they will eſtabliſh Chriſtes lawes and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without altering, changing, &amp;c? But ye alledge the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Primitiue Churches (for your patterns, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant) which ſued not to the Courtes and parlements, nor wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon Princes pleaſures, &amp;c. What can bee ſpoken more groſſely? The holy Apoſtles were ſent by our Sauiour into al the world, furniſhed with authoritie and commiſſion to ſet vp his kingdome. The Paſtors and Gouernours ordeined by them, receiue the power, not onely for themſelues, but alſo to conuey ouer vnto others, What maketh this for priuate men? Doubtleſſe ye haue no patterne in the Scriptures which you follow, but of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abyram</hi> with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who cried; Are not all the Lordes people holye: euen as you <hi>Browniſts,</hi> with the Anabaptiſts crye out: Are not all the Lordes people frée? Yee hane no commiſſion from GOD, it is the Deuill that hath thruſt yee forwarde,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14667:58"/>
and will yée in ſuch vile and wretched manner, pretend the examples of the Primitiue Churches? But your reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth much vpon this, that the Primitiue Churches ſtayed not the pleaſures of Princes. If this were granted, that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not to be ſtayed for, yet dooth it not follow there vpon, that priuate men are to eſtabliſh Church gouernement: but there muſt bee ſome to doo it, which are called and furniſhed with authority from God.</p>
               <p>Yet the queſtion dooth remaine touching Princes, whether they be to be ſtayed for? <hi>Browne</hi> maketh many arguments to prooue, that they are not to be ſtayed for, nor yet haue to do by publike power to eſtabliſh religion? which opinion of his, is with ſuch abridging the ſacred power of Princes, and with ſuch horrible iniurie to the Church, contrarye to the manifeſt worde of God: that if there were nothing elſe, it is enough to make him an odious and deteſtable heretike, vntill he ſhew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. You follow him héere, and alledge ſome reaſons which are to be conſidered. But firſt the queſtion which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, muſt be reſtrained vnto the ſpeciall. We muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh: for there be Heathen and Idolatrous Kings, and there be Chriſtian Princes. Thoſe are againſt Chriſt, and theſe are for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>When the holye Apoſtles were ſent foorth to Preach the Goſpell in the whole world, the Kings were all Heathen, and bent their power againſt them. To what end ſhould they, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing commiſſion from Chriſt, to eſtabliſh diſcipline, ſue vnto the Courts and Parliaments of ſuch Princes, or attend their pleaſure? The caſe is all one, where the kings profeſſe Chriſt in name, and be idolaters. As in <hi>France,</hi> the Miniſters whom God hath raiſed vp, and ſent to publiſh the Goſpell in former yeares, attended not the pleaſure of thoſe their idolatrous Kings, for the ſetting vp of diſcipline: for they might aſwell, at their inhibition, haue ceaſed from preaching. But where there is a Chriſtian Prince, the ſacred power of the ſword is with Chriſt and for his Church, and héere the caſe is cleane changed. For this Magiſtrate, King, or Quéene, ſitting vpon
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14667:58"/>
the royall Throne, and holding the Scepter, is the chiefs and principall member of the Church. This Magiſtrate bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods miniſter, and bearing the Sword to take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance vppon all euill dooers, <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> and to mayntayne peace with all godlineſſe and honeſtie, <hi>Timoth. 2.</hi> hath the charge and burthen not only to prouide for the bodyes of the Subiects, and theyr outward ciuill eſtate, but alſo by good ciuill Lawes, to procure the eſtabliſhing of Gods true Religion and worſhip among them, for the comfort of theyr Soules: for how ſhall he puniſh all euill, and mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne all Godlyneſſe by the Sword, but by eſtabliſhing Chriſtes holie Religion? Therefore this Magiſtrate is to aſſemble all the learned, the wiſe, the graue and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that he may conueniently, and to haue it diſcuſſed by the Word of God, which is the true and pure Doctrine, and which be the rules and orders that Chriſt hath giuen for the gouernment &amp; preſeruation of his Church. Then are Lawes to bée made (for Kings can not rule but by Lawes) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and aboliſh all falſe Religion, Superſtition, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and Hereſies; and to compell all ſtates and degrées of perſons within the Kingdome, to receyue the holie doctrine and rules of Chriſt, and to walke in the ſame. This dyd the Kings of <hi>Iuda,</hi> as the holie Scriptures doo playnely declare.</p>
               <p>Nowe if this Chriſtian Prince doo erre in ſome matters of Doctrine, or touching the rules of diſcipline, yet hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and mayntayning all the fundamentall poynts of the Chriſtian faith, ſo that there be abuſes and corruptions in the Churche, euerie priuate godlie man is to kéepe a good conſcience, not breaking the vnitie and peace of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but not to take publike authoritie to reforme. Then yée demaund, <hi>If they ſhould tarrie Princes leyſures, where were the perſecution wee ſpeake of?</hi> Héere ye vtter a moſt beaſtlie ſpéeche. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> willeth to make earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications for Princes, that wee may liue in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14667:59"/>
peace with all godlineſſe, <hi>1. Timoth. 2.</hi> Whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the defence of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bleſſing vnto the Church. And you take it, the Croſſe of Chriſt is aboliſhed, vnleſſe the Magiſtrate be prouoked, and doo perſecute. The faithfull doo beare the Croſſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches and afflictions vnder the moſt Godly Kings, who yet in dutie are vppon knowledge to redreſſe it. Do yée thincke the Godly did not beare the Croſſe vnder King <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was not frée himſelfe? Or would yée haue no peace by Chriſtian Kings? If your meaning be not ſuch, why doo yée vtter ſo wicked ſpéech?</p>
               <p>Then yée ſay, we make Chriſt attend vpon Princes.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that Chriſt hath ordinarie Miniſters, if theſe be ſlacke, when he will haue hys woorke doone, he can and hath rayſed vp extraordinarie workemen. If his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome lye waite, doth that warrant priuate men to ſteppe foorth, and to reforme or eſtabliſhe? Or ſhall Chriſt bée brought to ſtoupe vnto Princes, if euerie Schiſmatike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude not himſelfe to runne when GOD hath not ſente him?</p>
               <p>There be certayne Anſwers which go vnder the name of <hi>Henry Barowe,</hi> where béeing demaunded whether the Quéene may make Lawes for the Church which are not contrarie to the Word of God? The Anſwere is this, I thincke no Prince, neyther the whole world, nor the Church it ſelfe, can make any Lawes for the Church, other then Chriſt hath left in his Word.</p>
               <p>This ſéemeth vnto ſimple men a verie ſound Anſwere, drawne from two firme principles, the one, that there is but one Law-giuer, which is God: the other, that he hath by Ieſus Chriſt giuen full and perfect Lawes for hys Church. The deceypt lyeth hid in this, that men doo not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider there be generall lawes or rules giuen by Chriſt for matters of circumſtance, that bée indifferent and variable in the particulars, and ſo to be altered and aboliſhed, as
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14667:59"/>
the peace and edification of the Churche ſhall requyre. And therefore, that Princes with the Church are to ordeine and to eſtabliſh ſuch orders by thoſe generall rules, as may afterward for iuſt cauſe be altered. Wherefore it is manifeſt, that the anſwer of Barow, dooth cut off a great part of the Diſcipline, and ſhorten the power of the Prince. And moreouer, it is not conſidered, that the Prince, being to puniſhe all euill by the doctrine of Sainte <hi>Paul,</hi> and to maintaine all godlineſſe, cannot doo it but by lawes, and ſo is to eſtabliſhe by lawes the whole Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>Where, vpon this Anabaptiſticall anſwere of <hi>Barow</hi> (I thinke it the dutie of euerye Chriſtian, and principally of the Prince, to enquire out, and to reuew the lawes of GOD, and ſtirre vppe all the Subiects, vnto more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and carefull kéeping of the ſame) goeth alſo verye currant among manye. Whereas indéede, it denieth a great parte of that power which GOD hath giuen to Princes.</p>
               <p>For ſhall not the Chriſtian Magiſtrate, driue the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to heare the worde Preached? ſhall hee not puniſh the wicked deſpiſers, blaſphemers, Heretikes, Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, Idolators, and ſuch like? And howe can this bee doone, but by lawes made and eſtabliſhed? Yet <hi>Browne</hi> the roote of this hereſie, who hath by his writings ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the reſt, dooth make verye great ſhewe in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The kingdome of Chriſte is ſpirituall, and not ſet vp by the arme of fleſh and blood, but by the Holy-ghoſt. The Subiects of Chriſte come willinglye of theyr owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, and not by compulſion. None of all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye Kinges, durſt compell any to the worſhip of God. And that all the Kings of Iuda, which did reforme religion, did it by a ſpirituall power, as being figures of Chriſt.</hi> Indéed the kingdome of God is ſpirituall: all the power of Kings in the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14667:60"/>
world, cannot conuert one ſoule vnto Chriſte: that is doone by the Holy-ghoſte, through the liuelye worde of faithe. Neuertheleſſe, the ciuill power is an outwarde meane to driue men to heare the Goſpell preached, and to obey the diſcipline. Chriſtes ſubiects are franke and willing, ſo farre as his holye ſpirite and word haue wrought, and haue power in them to ſubdue, and bring vnder euery high thing, which exalteth it ſelfe againſt God: but before men bee conuerted, compulſion, euen with penalties, is a meane to bring them to that, whereby this regeneration is wrought: &amp; after conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God, there remaineth ſtill a great lumpe of corruption, which is to be kept in and bridled with ſome force. I will make the matter cléere, by the chaſtiſment which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture willeth Parents to vſe to their children. A father hath a ſonne which is diſſolute and proud, whom he cannot reclaime by anye inſtruction or exhortation. He correcteth him with ſtripes, and forceth him to heare the word of God diligentlye being preached. It pleaſeth God ſo to bleſſe this indeuour of the Father, that his Sonne is conuerted, and dooth become a right godlye man. Shall we ſaye he is none of Chriſtes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, becauſe at the firſt he came not willingly? The King is the Father of all his Subiects, and by fatherly correction la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to bring them to goodneſſe.</p>
               <p>And where <hi>Browne</hi> ſaith, that none of the Kings of Iuda, durſt compell their Subiects to the worſhip of God: it is moſt falſe. For beſide the puniſhment of death, mentioned in the dayes of <hi>Aſa.</hi> It is ſaid ſtatlye, that <hi>Ioſias</hi> compelled them to worſhip the Lorde God of their Fathers, <hi>2. Chron. 34.</hi> The Hebrew worde is <hi>Iagnabed,</hi> which is, he bound them, or made them ſerue. And finallye, where <hi>Browne</hi> faith, the Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> did reforme religion by a ſpirituall power, as figures of Chriſt, it is abſurd and falſe. Firſt ſéeing they did that which Chriſt himſelfe did not: for hee neuer reformed the ſtate of religion.</p>

religion, becauſe they were figures, and ſo did breake downe and roote out falſe worſhip: and Chriſt himſelfe, who then ſhould haue had all the power, did not meddle that way? Was not the high Préeſt as worthy to bee depoſed, as he whome <hi>Solomon</hi> did depoſe? Were there not horrible abuſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Préeſtes, the Scribes and Phariſies, which hee did but Preach againſt? Againe, will <hi>Browne</hi> be ſo fooliſh as to imagine, that the kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> ſet bodily penalties by a ſpirituall power? It is as cléere as may bee, that they reformed by that ciuill Kinglye power, which God gaue them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who made the Decrée for the building of the Temple in <hi>Ieruſalem, Ezra. 1.</hi> was no figure of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iehu</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who deſtroyed the Temple, the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, and the Prieſtes of <hi>Baal, 2. Kings. 10.</hi> was no figure of Chriſt. I conclude therefore, that the wickedneſſe of <hi>Browne,</hi> and of <hi>Browniſts,</hi> is great in thys poynt, when they in thys manner abridge the power of Princes, ſpoyle the Churche of her comfortable ayde and protection, and thruſt forward priuate men, to take vppon them that which God hath not called them vnto.</p>
               <p>And I doo intreate all Godly Chriſtians, and warne them in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that they looke to theſe holie rules of Gods Word. Firſt, with all humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, modeſtie, ſubiection, and lowlineſſe of mynde, to kéepe themſelues within the boundes and limits of theyr calling, ſtudying to be quiet, and to doo theyr owne buſineſſe, <hi>1.

               </p>
               <p>Then, that they turne not the holie Religion of GOD, or the profeſſion thereof, into queſtions, bitter diſputations, wrath, contentions, and vayne-glorious boaſting: but that in practiſe they followe after Righteouſneſſe, Faith, Loue, and Peace, with thoſe that call vppon the Lord out of a pure heart, <hi>2. Timoth. 2. verſ. 22.</hi> Finally, not in rigour and

preſumption to iudge, to condemne, and to treaddowne. But with mercie, with pittye, and compaſſion, to ſupporte the weake, <hi>Gal. 6.</hi> This is the plaine, ſtraight paued, and holye waye of GOD: and whoſoeuer maketh account of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let them take héede they bee not drawne out of it into crooked by wayes, and into myrie flowes, by preſumptuous Heretikes, and Schiſmatikes.</p>
