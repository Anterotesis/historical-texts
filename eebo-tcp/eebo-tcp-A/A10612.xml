         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

of <hi>Boſsier</hi> in the County of <hi>Namur</hi>
aforeſaid (diſpatched with Letters of the
Earle of <hi>Barlaymont,</hi> in the habite of a
Souldier, from <hi>Bruſſel,</hi> the tenth day of
March laſt:) was by Convoy conducted
thence to <hi>Louen, Dieſt, Herentals,</hi> and
<hi>Tuernoult</hi>: from whence accompanied
onely with one of the garriſon of the ſayd
Towne, he was guided to the Towne of <hi>Bredau</hi>: where being
entred, he deliuered certaine cloſe ſealed Letters, vnto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
there, which were addreſſed from the Earle of <hi>Barlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
vnto Captayne <hi>Larigon</hi> Commaunder of the Caſtle of
<hi>Tuernoult,</hi> importing, that the bringer thereof, was ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by expreſſe commaundement of Archduke <hi>Erneſtus</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi>
to communicate vnto him a certaine enterpriſe, to be done
vpon the towne of <hi>Bredau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Gouernour deſirous to be by him further inſtructed, as
well of the cauſe of his comming thither, as of the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the ſaid enterpriſe: <hi>Renichon</hi> firſt humbly besought him,
that it would pleaſe him to entertaine him into his ſeruice, and
then, perſiſting (though differing and dubling in his aſſertions,
which ſauored of manifeſt vntruethes) that his matter was iuſt
and perfect: Affirmed, that for certaine yeares, he had bene Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
to the Abbot of <hi>Malonne,</hi> and for his knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
he was by him aduaunced to the ſame place, with the
Earle of <hi>Barlaymont</hi>: from whome hee had after thys manner
withdrawen himſelfe, onely for the feruent deſire hé had to doe
him ſeruice, with ſuch other the like accomplements.</p>
            <p>The Gouernour finding ſmall probability in hys filed ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
feared greatly ſome pretence of waightier matter: and for
that cauſe, cauſed him forthwith to be conveighed to the <hi>Haghe</hi>:
Where, vpon the firſt of Aprill, (fearing what would enſue) he
attempted to ſtrangle himſelfe with a corde made of points and
ſtringes of his Armes, faſtened to a certayne iron in the Gaole,
vnder which he was found all be blouded, and ſpeechleſſe.</p>
            <p>Reuiued now, and come to his ſpeech agayne, one demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for what cauſe he would haue committed this acte vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
whereunto replying, hee confeſſed volontarily, without
<pb facs="tcp:5464:3"/>
proffer of any torture or conſtraint, as well by word of mouth,
on the ſecond of Aprill, as alſo afterward by his owne hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at ſundry times, as namely on the twentieth day of Aprill,
and laſt of May, the very abſolute trueth of hys comming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
affirming the ſpeeches vttered by him and fathered vppon
the Abbot of <hi>Malonne,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Barlaymont,</hi> to bee falſe
and forged, acknowledging further.</p>
            <p>That hauing had long proceſſe in Law againſt his Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of <hi>Boſsier,</hi> touching the reuenues of his Parſonage: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
endamaged through the dayly incurſions of the vnbrideled
ſouldiours: he was enforced by meere neceſſity about ſome two
yeares ſithence, to abandon his Parſonage, and committing the
cure thereof vnto a Chaplaine, retired himſelfe vnto the Towne
of <hi>Namours,</hi> where he ſupplied the roome of a Scholemaſter.</p>
            <p>The Earle of Barlaymont, hauing had ſome intelligence of
my being there, entreated me by ſome of hys gentlemen, on an
Euening to ſuppe with him: ſupper being ended, the Earle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
himſelfe into hys Chamber, and commaunded me to bee
brought in to him: where (his people withdrawen) he asked me
how I could with ſo ſmall allowance content my ſelf, and ſpend
my time, to ſo little proffite, adding further, that hee knew the
meanes how to aduaunce my eſtate, if eyther I would ſeeke it
at his handes, or rouſe and plucke vp my appaled ſpirites, for
which his honourable courteſies, humbly thanking him, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him my beſt ſeruice.</p>
            <p>The which now preſented, hee tooke occaſion to ſend for me
in February laſt paſt, by his Chaplaine after ſupper, falling in
diſcourſe with me, in the preſence of ſome other, of an enterpriſe
to be done vpon the Towne of <hi>Bredau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Likewiſe at an other time being entred into his Chamber, he
ſent for me againe, at which time he tolde mee, that hee was to
communicate vnto me a matter of greater conſequence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
and that if I would employ my ſelfe in the ſeruice of
the king, he would richly and royally recompence me. Vppon
which promiſe, I vowed my ſeruice to him againe.</p>
            <p>Not long after this, I was by him commaunded to follow him
to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where the ſayd Earle diuers and ſondry times fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
the Court, at length commanded me to attend on him
thither: with whome paſſing from chamber to chamber, at laſt,
<pb facs="tcp:5464:3"/>
the Earle entred the chamber of the Archduke <hi>Erneſtus</hi>: whom
I then beheld, minding to follow after hym: at which tyme I
was partly hindered by the ſuddaine falling too of the doore:
which not fully ſhut, (liſtening what might paſſe betwéene the
Archduke and the ſayd Earle,) I eaſely heard them ſpeake Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
and Latine: and at ſundry times, make repetition of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
and reward: The Earle ready to take hys leaue of the
Duke, who brought him to the chamber doore: the Duke at
his laſt farewell, ſayd, <hi>Cumulate &amp; largo foenore ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam.</hi>
When the Earle returned, he told mee, that they had all
that time, conferred about my matters: and that the Archduke
had ordained two hundred Phillips Dollors to be deliuered me.</p>
            <p>Retired now to his lodging, he gaue me further to vnderſtand
that the Archdukes pleaſure and full intention was, to roote out,
or by a third hand violently to murther the Counte <hi>Maurice</hi> of
<hi>Naſſau</hi>: and for that end and purpoſe, he had already diſpatched
certaine other perſons, aſſuring me, that if I would likewiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
the like action, it ſhould be great aduauncement for me
and all my fréendes: ſaying further, that there were allready
fiftéene thouſand crownes gathered together, to bee disburſed to
him, that firſt ſhould bring to paſſe the foreſaid maſſacre or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Vppon this point I aunſweared the Earle, that it was an
action méerely impertinent to my profeſſion, who had neuer
borne armes: he replied that it was the will and pleaſure of the
king, and the commaund of the Archduke, and therewithall, fell
to perſwading me agayne wyth many vehement reaſons, in ſuch
ſort, as I promiſed to do my vttermoſt endeuor to that ende.</p>
            <p>Therevppon I deſired the ſaid Earle, to inſtruct mee. how I
might behaue my ſelfe in this enterpriſe: hee aunſweared, that
the Counte <hi>Maurice</hi> being a yong noble man, very familiar and
popular, it were a very eaſie matter to inſinuate himſelfe in hys
fauor: that it muſt not bee wrought in haſt or raſhly, but wyth
great aduiſe and leyſure, That he was to make hys repaire into
the Haghe, or ſuch other place where the Counte were moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant:
that there, he ſhould vnder the coullour of teaching a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſchoole, expect and waight for the comming of ſuch other as
were aſſigned to the like ende and purpoſe (whereof there were
ſix and he was the ſeauenth, who taking aduiſe and councell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:5464:4"/>
vppon one obſeruation made, might eaſely woorke the
depth of their deſire: aduiſing me further, that I was to prouide
my ſelfe of a paire of good Piſtols, with firelockes, the which (bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
carefully and clenly kept) I ſhould charge with two or thrée
bullets, and vpon the firſt occaſion proffered, ſhould ſhoot through
the ſaid Counte, or otherwiſe murther hym<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by what deuyſe or
practiſe I either beſt could my ſelfe: or the other which yet were
to repayre vnto me. In concluſion affirming, that hee who beſt
and firſt behaued himſelfe in this action, ſhould be best and firſt
rewarded.</p>
            <p>That there were alſo other, which were to be made away by
like practiſe, videlicet, <hi>Barneuelt, Longolius,</hi> and <hi>S. Allegonde</hi>:
of whome, or any of them, if he could procure their death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
he ſhould bee richly likewiſe recompenced, charginge
him eſpecially to alter his name, and to apparell himſelfe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diorlike for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>These and ſuch other exhortations ended, the Counte <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laymont</hi>
cauſed certayne other perſons to bee brought into my
preſence: of whome, he ſaid that one of them, was of the ſix aboue
mentioned: to whome he declared that I was lately adopted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their fellowſhip: vpon which ſpéech, the ſaid party embracing
me, called me his <hi>Camerado</hi>: aſſuring me that in ſhort time, he
would follow me into <hi>Holland,</hi> for and vpon the like occaſions.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Countie further declared, that the ſayde ſixe perſons
are, and haue bene euer ſince the death of the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi>
and before, notorious murtherers, and that they are allowed
gentlemens pay in the Court there, by the King, and vppon any
ſuch deſperate action, are onely and euer employed againſt the
ennemy.</p>
            <p>Thus retyring himſelfe from our company, he diſpatched hys
Secretary incontinently to <hi>Stephen de Narra,</hi> of whome he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in ſundry kindes of quoyne, the foreſayde ſomme of two
hundred Dollars, the which was preſently by him deliuered me.</p>
            <p>Being now furniſhed of all things expedient for my iourney,
and ready to depart from <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to <hi>Andwerpe,</hi> I was by one
of the ſixe perſons aboue mencioned, conducted to the <hi>Schuite,</hi>
who at my very departure ſignified vnto mee, that hee aſſuredly
hoped to haue borne me company to <hi>Leiden</hi>: of whom demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
where that was, and to what ende: hee aunſweared me,
<pb facs="tcp:5464:4"/>
that <hi>Leiden</hi> was a Towne and an Vniuerſity in Holland, wher
the younge Prince of Orange ſtudied, whether hee ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be employed, to the intent that inſinuating himſelfe into
his fauor, he might with better conveniency bereaue hym of hys
life.</p>
            <p>Thus reſolued to obey the Counte of <hi>Barlaymonts</hi> pleaſure
and commaund, I first cloathed my ſelfe ſouldierlike, named my
ſelfe <hi>Michil de Triuier,</hi> and arriued at <hi>Andwerpe</hi> with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Letters of the County of <hi>Barlaymont,</hi> addreſſed to <hi>Largion,</hi>
where (vnderſtanding that he was vpon occaſions departed from
<hi>Tuernault</hi>) I was enforced to alter my courſe, and returned to
<hi>Bruſſels</hi> againe: where receiuing other Letters of the foreſaide
County, tooke my way to <hi>Louen, Dieſt, Herentals,</hi> and <hi>Tuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault,</hi>
from whence as aforeſaid, I came to <hi>Bredau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The generall Eſtates of the vnited Prouinces of the Low-Countries,
duely examining the ſtate of this cauſe, finding it a
matter of very euill example, as alſo, that in a Country of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
