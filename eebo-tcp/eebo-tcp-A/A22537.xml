         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas in the Reigne of Our most deare and Royall Father,</hi>
King <hi>IAMES</hi> of blessed memory, &amp; since Our accesse to the Crowne,
seuerall Proclamations haue been made and published concerning
Tobacco, Yet notwithstanding all the care and prouidence which
hath hitherto been vsed, We finde the vnlimited desire of gaine, and
the inordinate appetite of taking Tobacco, hath so farre preuailed,
that Tobacco hath been continued to bee planted in great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
in seuerall parts of this Our Realme, and a vast proportion
of vnseruiceable Tobacco made and brought from Our Colonies
of <hi>Virginia Summer Ilands,</hi> and other Our Forreigne Plantations,
besides an incredible quantity of <hi>Brasill</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Tobacco imported hither, and secretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
on Land. And it is now come to passe, That those Our Forreigne Plantations, that
might become vsefull to this Kingdome, lingering onely vpon Tobacco, are in apparant
danger to be vtterly ruined, vnlesse Wee speedily prouide for their subsistence; The bodies and
manners of Our people are also in danger to bee corrupted, and the wealth of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
exhausted by so vselesse a Weede as Tobacco is; which beeing represented vnto Us by
the humble Petition of Our louing Subiects the Planters and Aduenturers in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and
also by the like humble Petition of the Retailers and Sellers of Tobacco in and about Our
Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> Wee haue thought it worthy of Our Princely care, as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not only fit for Our profit, &amp; the profit of Our people, but much concerning Us in Our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and gouernment so to regulate the same, and compell due obedience thereto, that Our
Forreigne Plantations and Colonies may bee supported and encouraged, and they made vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to this Kingdome, by applying themselues to more solide commodities, that the healths
of Our Subiects may be preserued, the wealth of this Kingdome enlarged, and the manners
of Our people so ordered and gouerned, that the world may not iustly taxe Us, that these are
at once endangered only by the licentious vse of Tobacco. And therfore hauing seriously adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
hereof, Wee, by the aduice of Our Priuie Councell, haue now resolued vpon, and published
these Our Commands following concerning Tobacco, which Our Royall will and pleasure
is, shall be in all things obserued vpon paine of Our highest displeasure, and of such paines, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties
and punishments, as by Our Court of Exchequer, and Court of Starre-Chamber,
and by any other Courts and ministers of Iustice, or by Our Prerogatiue Royall can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
vpon the offendors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:28642:2"/>
And first, Our will and Command is, that no person whatsoeuer doe at any time here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
plant, preserue, or maintaine any Tobacco, which is, hath been, or shall be planted in
Our Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> or in the Islands of <hi>Iersey</hi> or
<hi>Guernesey,</hi> but that the same bee vtterly displanted and destroyed, and that none presume or
aduenture to Buy, Sell, or vtter any such Tobacco, the same being vtterly vnwholesome
to bee taken.</p>
            <p>And further, that no Tobacco whatsoeuer be from hencefoorth imported into these Our
realms, or any Hauen, Port, Creeke or place therof, which is, or shal be of the growth of any
the parts or places beyond the Seas, belonging to, or vnder the obedience of any foreine King,
Prince, or State whatsoeuer; But such, and so much thereof onely, as Wee shall specially allow
to be imported, vntill it shal be fully setled betweene those Forreine Princes and Us, according
to those Treaties which are betweene Us, that Our Subiects may not vnthriftily vent the
solide Commodities of Our owne Kingdomes, and returne the proceed thereof in Smoake.</p>
            <p>And further We will and command, that no Tobacco of the growth of any of Our English
Plantations in <hi>Virginia</hi> the <hi>Sommer Islands, Caribee Islands,</hi> or other Islands or places in <hi>America,</hi>
or the Coasts thereof, be at any time hereafter imported or brought into Our Kingdomes of
<hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> at any other Port then at, or in Our Port of <hi>London</hi>
onely, and the same duely entred in Our Custome-houses there, nor that any greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie
thereof bee imported there, then Wee by the aduice of Our Priuie Councell shall hold fit,
and vnder Our Priuie Seale, shall declare to bee competent for the expence of these Our
Kingdomes, Wee not thinking it fit to admit of an immeasurable expence of so vaine and
needlesse a Commoditie, which ought to bee vsed as a Drugge onely, and not so vainely and
wantonly as an euill habite of late times hath brought it vnto.</p>
            <p>And these sorts of Tobacco which shall be thus brought from Our owne Colonies, Wee
will take present order shall bee well ordered and made vp, and so certified to bee, vnder the
hand of the Gouernour of that place, and when the same shall be brought hither, shall bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
Searched, Tryed and Sealed, that Our Subiects be not abused by corrupt Tobacco.</p>
            <p>And Our expresse Command is, that whatsoeuer Tobacco shall be taken, which shall
be imported contrary to this Our Proclamation, the same shall be forfeited and confiscate, and
by the Officers of that Port or place where it shall bee taken, shall be immediatly burnt.</p>
            <p>And for the ordering and gouerning of the expence and vse of Tobacco when it shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
Wee, by the aduice of Our Priuie Councell, shall speedily direct such a course as Wee
shall hold fit, which Wee expect shall be also in all things obserued.</p>
            <p>And Wee straitly charge and Command all Our Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers,
and all other the Officers and Ministers of Our Ports, that they and euery of them in their
seuerall places, doe carefully and faithfully obserue Our Royal Command, in, and concerning
the premisses; and if any of them shall be found remisse or negligent therein, or to conniue at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such offender, that hee or they shall for such their fault, without any remission be remooued
from the place or places of his or their attendance on Our seruice.</p>
            <p>And to the end Our pleasure and Command hereby published, may be the better executed,
Wee doe hereby will, require and Command, all Maiors, Sheriffes, Iustices of peace, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffes,
Headboroughs, and other Our Officers and louing Subiects whatsoeuer, to be aiding
and assisting, and so much as in them lyeth, to take care that the premisses herein mentioned,
be duly put in execution, as they tender their duetie and allegeance to Us, and will answere the
contrary at their vttermost perils.</p>
