            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Town of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> is built upon a Rock,
waſhed almoſt on every ſide by a little River,
called <hi>Alſiette,</hi> which comes from the <hi>South,</hi> and
having almoſt encompaſſed that place, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
its courſe towards the <hi>North.</hi> The part of
the Rock environed by the River is exceeding
ſteep, and needs no other Defence but its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Scituation: ſo that they have ſcarce built any
Fortifications on thoſe ſides. The ſide not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed
by the River, which looks towards the
<hi>Weſt,</hi> is Fortified with four <hi>Baſtions</hi> cut into the
Rock, as is alſo the Ditch, which is very deep.
There are before theſe <hi>Baſtions, Countergards, Half-Moons</hi>
and <hi>Ravelins</hi> cut into the Rock, as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the Ditches that cover them. Before all theſe
Works there are two open ways with their Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys;
the firſt whereof is defended by four Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douts
of Stone in the <hi>Angles,</hi> bearing out from
the <hi>Counterſcarp.</hi> This ſide which is not invironed
by the River, was the only place whereby the
Town could be aſſaulted, all the reſt being found
too ſteep; and of this ſide the part attacked was
the new Gate, which is on the <hi>North,</hi> near the
place where the River begins to turn away from
the Town.</p>

At Nine in the Evening they opened about half
a Musket-ſhot from the <hi>Counterſcarp,</hi> a <hi>Trench,</hi>
parallel to the attack'd ſide of the place, about five
Hundred Toiſes long, and this work was carried
on two ſeveral ways, the one by the Chappel on
the Left-hand of the Head Quarters; and the
other on the ſide of <hi>Paffendal,</hi> on the other ſide
of the oppoſite place. The <hi>Pioneers</hi> of the Attack

Chappel of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which is about a Piſtol-ſhot
from the <hi>Counterſcarp;</hi> and thoſe of the Attack

<hi>Gromp,</hi> or of the <hi>Baſſe-Ville,</hi> with a <hi>Batallion</hi> of
<hi>Conde;</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>de Crenan</hi> made another

there was a Battery traced upon the Hill of <hi>Paf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendal,</hi>
where there was a <hi>Batallion</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> with
a Detachment of two Hundred Men. The Prince

about two in the Morning they began to Fire
very briskly at us with their Muskets. There was
not however above eight or nine of our Men
Killed and Wounded, which were of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Campagne.</hi> About Break of Day they
played alſo ſmartly upon us with their Cannon,
which yet had not any conſiderable Effect. Some
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56947:7"/>
Horſe Sallied out of the Town about four or five
in the Morning, but haſtily Retreated at the firſt
Firing of the Detachments, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to ſhelter the Laborers. They perſiſted all
that day to play upon us with their Cannon, but
ſtill without much ſucceſs. On our ſide they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to work on the Batteries.</p>
            <p>The <hi>9th.</hi> there was a Man ſtopt, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to get into <hi>Luxembourg:</hi> and there was
found about him a Paſsport from the Marqueſs
<hi>de Grana,</hi> Dated <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>28th,</hi> with Bills of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi>
for five and thirty Thouſand <hi>Florins,</hi> pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> and many Letters in <hi>Ciphers.</hi>
We knew alſo by the ſame way, that there were
ſeveral Officers who deſigned to get into the
Town, to joyn with their Regiments there.</p>
            <p>In the Evening the Marqueſs <hi>de Genlis,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General for the day, and the Sieur <hi>de Joſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaux,
Brigadier</hi> of Foot, relieved the Count <hi>du
Pleſſis,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de la Ferte,</hi> who had the
Right hand of the great Attach: and the Sieur
<hi>d'Erlac, Mareſchal de Camp</hi> relieved the Count <hi>de
Broglio,</hi> who had the Left. Two <hi>Batallions</hi> of <hi>Navar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
relieved on the Right the two of <hi>Compagne,</hi> and
the <hi>Batallions</hi> of <hi>Vaubecourt,</hi> and <hi>Conti,</hi> at the head
of which was the Prince <hi>de Conti,</hi> accompanied
by the Prince <hi>de la Roche, Sur Yon</hi> in the quality of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56947:7"/>
a Volunteer, relieved on the left, that of <hi>Enguien,</hi>
and that of <hi>la Ferte.</hi> The Beſieged (at the time
we went to releive the <hi>Trenches)</hi> ſet Fire to the
Houſes of a part of the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> of <hi>Paffendal:</hi>
they quitted alſo a Mill, which was but fifty pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from it, having prepared a Mine to blow it
up, (in the belief they had, that our men would
ſeize thereon:) but we went not thither, and the
Mine ſprang without the ſucceſs they expected.
During the night we carried on a ſecond <hi>Trench,</hi>
parallell to the firſt of the great Attack, within ſix<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
Toiſes of the covered Fore way of the Place: and
the Communications were made without any of
the workmens being Kill'd or wounded, altho'the
Enemy Fired Stifly upon them with their Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.
The Sieur <hi>de Montmeillant,</hi> Captain in the
Royal Regiment, and the Sieur <hi>de Favigny,</hi>
Captain and Ayde Major of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and four
or five Lieutenants were ſlightly wounded. We
continued alſo to work diligently on the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
raiſed on the Hills of our <hi>Lady of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The Beſieged about break of day played
briskly with their Cannon; but we had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
ſix or ſeven Soldiers ſlain.</p>
            <p>The 10th. Two of our Batteries of ſeven pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Cannon each, began to play about eight
in the Morning with great ſucceſs; and a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56947:8"/>
of Nine Mortar-pieces, which had been put
n order by the Sieur de <hi>Vigny</hi> began about Noon
o caſt its Bombs againſt a Platform of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
on the Right; and we diſmounted three
Pieces of a Battery of four Pieces, which the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
had erected there, and from whence they
Fired very vigorouſly. The ſame day a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
of five Pieces, which was upon the Hill of
<hi>Bonnevoye,</hi> began alſo to Play. We raiſed one of
Two Pieces upon the Riſing Ground, which looks
into the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> of <hi>Gromp,</hi> and we continued
to work upon one of Fifteen on the Hill of <hi>Paf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendal;</hi>
which was finiſhed with the loſs only of
Nine Soldiers killed, and ſeven or eight wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with three or four Officers.</p>
            <p>In the Evening the <hi>Sieur de Joyeuſe,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
General for the day, the Marqueſs <hi>de Renti,</hi>
Mareſchal <hi>de Camp,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Refuge,</hi>
Brigadier of Foot, relieved the Marqueſs <hi>de Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
the <hi>Sieur d' Erlac,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Joſſeaux,</hi>
with the two Batallions of <hi>Piemont;</hi> the firſt
Batallion of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> and the firſt Batallion of
the Royal <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> which entred the Trenches
in the place of the two Batallions of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
and the two of <hi>Vaubecoutt</hi> and <hi>Conti.</hi> In the night
there was carried on a third Trench, parallel to
the ſecond, about Thirty Paces from the firſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56947:8"/>
covered way, which comprehended all the Out-works of
the Attack. The Beſieged burnt this Night the other part
of the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> of <hi>Paffendal;</hi> and Fired alſo at us briskly
with their Muskets.</p>
            <p>All the following day they played upon us with their
Cannon; and yet kill'd us but about Seven or Eight Men,
and wounded Ten or Twelve. The ſame day, <hi>viz.</hi> the 11th.
the Beſiegers finiſhed their Battery of Fifteen Pieces, and with
their Cannon and Bombs entirely ruined the Platforms and
Defences of the Baſtion on the Right.</p>
            <p>In the Evening the Count <hi>de</hi> St. <hi>Geran,</hi> Lieutenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and the Marqueſs <hi>de Neſle,</hi> Brigadier of Foot, relieved
the <hi>Sieur de Joyeuſe,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Refuge,</hi> who were on
the right hand of the great Attack; and the Chevalier <hi>de
Tilladet,</hi> Mareſchal <hi>de</hi> Camp, Relieved the Marqueſs <hi>de Renti,</hi>
who was on the Left. The Trenches were mounted on the
Right by two Batallions of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who took the Poſt of
the two Batallions of <hi>Piemont;</hi> and the Batallions of <hi>Lionnois</hi>
and <hi>Turenne</hi> relieved on the Left the Batallions of <hi>Auvergne</hi>
and the Royal. The Trench, which comprehended all the
Outworks of the Place, was carried on within Twenty Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the firſt open way. The <hi>Sieur de Vigny</hi> made a Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
an Hundred and fifty Paces to the Left, from the firſt he had
made, to ruine with Bombs the Platform and Batteries which
were upon the Baſtion on the Left. The Lieutenant of the
Granadiers of <hi>Normandy,</hi> a Sub-Lieutenant of <hi>Enguien,</hi> and
Nine Soldiers were ſlain, and ſix or ſeven wounded.</p>
            <p>The Morrow being the 12th. the other Batteries were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
and Thirty eight Pieces of Connon, and fifteen Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-Pieces
began that day to play continually. The ſame day
about Noon, a Cannon-Bullet of the Beſiegeds ſet on Fire
Thirty Bombs of the Beſiegers, which were on the <hi>Sieur de
Vigny</hi>'s firſt Battery: Seven Gunners and two Soldiers were
kil'd, and there were ſix grievouſly wounded. The <hi>Sieur de
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56947:9"/>
Caillemote,</hi> ſecond Son of the Marqueſs <hi>de Ruvigny,</hi> was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Throat with a Musket-ſhot.</p>
            <p>In the Evening the Marqueſs de <hi>Lambert,</hi> Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
the <hi>Sieur de Rubantel,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Crenan,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the General Officers which were in the Trenches; two
Batallions of the Marine Relieved the Poſt on the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand;
and two Batallions of the Queens Relieved the Poſt
on the Left. During the Night the Beſiegers lodged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on the Cauſey of the covered way; and there was a
Communication made from one Lodgment to the other. The
Work was carried on at the Attack of <hi>Bonnevoye,</hi> within 30
Paces of the Ditch, on the ſide of the Gate of <hi>Thionville,</hi>
where a Battery of 5 Pieces was raiſed. At the ſame time we
Advanced 5 of the great Battery of <hi>Paffendal</hi> for to Batter
on the reverſe the Baſtion and Out-works of the great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
on the Left, and to beat down the Gate of <hi>Paffendal</hi>
There was opened at the Attack of <hi>Gromp,</hi> within 20 Paces of
the Ditch, a Trench, parallel to the Front, which has upon
one and the ſame Line 4 Towers, and which faces the Hill of
<hi>Gromp:</hi> we brought down the Battery which was upon this
Hill, with a deſign to beat in pieces the Gate of this <hi>Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi>
and ſo to be able to diſmount 2 Pieces which were on
a Platform within 100 Paces on the Right hand of this Gate,
and which much incommoded the Beſiegers: We ſeized on a
Church within half a Masket-ſhot of the place, ſcituated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a riſing Ground between <hi>Gromp</hi> and <hi>Paffendal,</hi> the Enemy
not making any reſiſtance. Fifty men were left there to keep
it. There was this Night a Serjeant kil'd, with about Ten
Soldiers, and Twenty wounded.</p>
            <p>The 13th in the Morning a Soldier of the place came into
the Camp; he told us, that the Prince <hi>de Chimay</hi> had been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to commit the defence of the Out-works to the
Townſmen, and to draw the Soldiers into the Town for fear
of their running away. About Noon the beſieged Sprang two
little Mines under a Lodgment we had made on the right
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56947:9"/>
hand, upon the Cauſey of the firſt covered way; there were
Three Soldiers ſlain, and about Fifteen wounded.</p>
            <p>In the Evening the Count <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> Lieutenant General, the
Sieur <hi>de Gournay,</hi> Mareſchal <hi>de</hi> Camp, and the Sieur <hi>de Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
Brigadier of Foot, relieved the General officers in the
Trenches: A Batallion of <hi>Bourbonnois,</hi> one of <hi>Humieres,</hi> one
of the Crown, and one of <hi>Languedoc</hi> Relieved thoſe which
were at the great Attack. The Marqueſs <hi>de Humieres,</hi> only
Son to the Mareſchal <hi>de Humieres,</hi> was ſlain by a Musket-ſhot
which hit him in the Head. About Midnight 4 Parties of
Granadiers, of 10 Men each, had order to enter at the ſame
time by 4 ſeveral places into the firſt covered way, to ſettle
themſelves therein if they found not too great reſiſtance; and
to ſeize on a Redout, called the Redout of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> which is
between the two covered ways: But after they had born a
violent Charge of Muskets, Granadoes and Fireworks, they
were forced to Retreat, becauſe this Redout was reveſted in
the ſame manner as the Ditch, wherein there was a Caponiere
fill'd with Musketeers, and becauſe there was no getting into
it but by a Gallery under Ground, the end whereof joyned
to the covered way neareſt the place.</p>
            <p>Thus were we obliged to proceed along by digging as far
as the Palizadoes, whence we carried on a Lodgment in the
covered way, which the Beſiegers extended on the Right and
Left of the bottom of the Ditch of the Redoubt: and the
Miners, to overthrow it, wrought under the Ditch. At the
Attack on the Left, our Men lodged themſelves on the Cauſey
of the covered way, whence was a Communication made to
the Lodgement on the Right. A Lieutenant of the Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
was kill'd, with 3 Serjeants, 9 or 10 Soldiers, and 5 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniers;
and a Captain with about 20 Soldiers wounded.</p>
            <p>In the Evening the Poſts of the Trenches were Relieved
by the Marqueſs <hi>de Genlis,</hi> Lieutenant: General: the Marqueſs
<hi>d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xelles,</hi> Mareſchal <hi>de</hi> Camp, and the Duke <hi>de la Ferte.</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier
of Foot, with 2 Batallions of <hi>Champagne,</hi> that of <hi>la Ferte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:56947:10"/>
and one of <hi>Orleans.</hi> There was finiſhed on the right hand of
the great Attack, the Lodgment in the covered way, upon the
brink of the Ditch of the Redoubt, where the Miners could
not eaſily go on becauſe of the Rock they there met with;
We brought on 2 Pieces of Cannon endeavouring to break
the Communication of the Redoubt with the ſecond covered
way. On the Left hand of the Attack was ſent forth a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
of Grandiers of <hi>la Ferte,</hi> to ſee if the Enemies had
quitted the firſt covered way on that ſide. They could not
come to know it, becauſe the Enemies were there couched on
their Bellies, and at the appearance of our Men roſe, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
them to retire: Ten of the Granadiers were ſlain, and 2
mortally wounded; the Captain had his Arm broken, and
the Sub-Lieutenant was wounded the Marqueſs <hi>de Genils</hi>'s
Ayde <hi>de</hi> Camp received a mortal wound; and two Officers of
<hi>Orleans</hi> were ſlightly wounded.</p>
            <p>The 15th. Three Fugitives from the Place related, That
the Governor of the Town, the Prince <hi>de Chimay,</hi> was that
Night wouuded in the Leg, and that the Major was killed.
That day we Advanced two Batteries, each of two Pieces of
Cannon, for to batter a Redoubt, which is near the two co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
ways on the Left; and in the mean time we played
the moſt advantagiouſly we could from the Batteries that
were in condition, for to ruine the Out-works and Defences
of the Baſtion on the ſame ſide: we ſeized alſo two Redouts
on the backſide of <hi>Paffendal</hi> which the Cannon of the Beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
had very much dammaged.</p>
            <p>In the Evening the Guard of the Trenches was Relieved
by the Sieur <hi>de Joyeuſe,</hi> the Count <hi>de Broglia</hi> and the Sieur
<hi>de Joſſeaux,</hi> with the 2 Batallions of <hi>Navarre,</hi> that of <hi>Vaube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>
and that of <hi>Conti,</hi> in the Head whereof was the Prince
<hi>de Conti:</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>de la Valette</hi> had at the ſame time his
Thigh broken by a Cannon ſhot from one of our Batteries
which had paſſed over the Town. In the night the Beſiegers
made themſelves Maſters of a third Redoubt on the backſide
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56947:10"/>
of <hi>Paffendal.</hi> We carried on the Lodgment which was upon the
Cauſey of the firſt covered way, near 15 Toiſes to the right
and left; and in the midſt of this Advance were raiſed two
Platforms, for to look backwards into the covered way: The
Beſieged Fired fiercely all the night, but with little ſucceſs.
About 5 in the Morning they quitted the covered way, and
Sprang a Mine, which they believed muſt be under our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
but it had not any effect. The Beſiegers took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of an enforcement, which this Mine had made near
the Palizadoes, and made uſe of it to Lodge themſelves there:
but this deſign would not eaſily have ſucceeded, had not the
Prince <hi>de Conti</hi> by his Preſence and Bounty encouraged the
Soldiers, whom the fear of a ſecond Mine hindred from
working. An Ingenier and 4 Soldiers were ſlain on this occaſion,
and a Capt. of <hi>Navarre,</hi> one of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> the Sub-Lieutenant of
the Granadiers of <hi>Conti,</hi> and 9 or 10 Soldiers were wounded.
We extended the Lodgement which was on the brink of the
Ditch of the Redoubt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>16th</hi> the Beſieged battered with much ſucceſs the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dout
which was on there left, between the two covered ways:
and a Mine, which had been made to open the Ditch of that
Redout on the Right, had all the effect they deſired. The <hi>Sieur
de Court,</hi> Major of <hi>Conti,</hi> was Kill'd in coming down from the
Trenches. We have ſince the <hi>16th</hi> ruined, with the great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
of <hi>Paffendal,</hi> a Traverſe of ſtone about 6 Toiſes long, which
was at the point of an Half Moon, that covers the Baſtion on
the left, to hinder us from looking between the oppoſite
Hills into the covered way of the place, we likewiſe ruined
with the ſame Battery, two Towers which covered the Gate
of the Tower on that ſide.</p>
            <p>According to the laſt News, come from the Siege, thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to batter many little works, full of earth, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
aginſt this Gate, the Baſtion, and the Three Redoubts.
whereof ours had made themſelves Maſters, and which flank'd
the Reverſe of the Hills. The Beſiegers were reſolved to ſet
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56947:11"/>
afterward the Miner to the Baſtion, and they hop'd to ſucceed
eaſily therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe there was no Ditch on that ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the <hi>16th</hi> in the Evening the Count de <hi>St. Geran;</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tenant
General for the day, and Sieur <hi>de Refuge,</hi> Brigadier of
Foot, mounted the Trenches on the Right, and the Sieur <hi>d'Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac,</hi>
Mareſchal <hi>de Camp</hi> mounted on the Left. Two Batallions of
<hi>Piemont</hi> relieved thoſe of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and two Batallions of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne,</hi>
and the Royal, relieved thoſe of <hi>Vaubecourt</hi> and <hi>Conti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We carried on during the Night, to the Mine, the Trench
which is of the brink of the Ditch of the Redout on the Right,
advancing towards the ſecond covered way: and we continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to batter a Breach in the Redout. On the Left we extended
in the firſt covered way to the Lodgment which had been
made there, and we wrought for the Communication of the
three Redouts, which are on the backſide of <hi>Paffendal:</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
Fired vigourouſly this night and there were nine or ten
Soldiers kill'd and about twenty Wounded. The ſame Night
we extended at the Attack of <hi>Grondt</hi> the Lodgment all along
the Ditch, and brought thither a Battery of 3 Pieces. There was
not any new work made on the ſide of the Attack of <hi>Bonnevoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Evening of the <hi>17th</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Lambert</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General, and the Marqueſs <hi>de Crenan,</hi> Brigadier of Foot,
relieved the Guard of the Trenches on the Right with a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallion
of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and that of <hi>Soiſſons;</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de
Renti,</hi> Mareſchal de <hi>Camp,</hi> relieved it on the Left with a Batal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of <hi>Lyonnois,</hi> and that of <hi>Turenne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We continued on the Right to Batter the Redout; and to
work through the Mine, with a deſign to incloſe it. We per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
on the Left the Lodgments and Communications which
had been made there:, and we diſcharged abundance of Cannon
and Bombs, to finiſh the ruining the Defences of the attaked
ſide, and the Palizadoes which remain'd on the ſecond cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
way. The Beſieged alſo Fired fierceiy during the Night,
and kill'd us about twenty Soldiers, and wounded five and
twenty, or thirty, with four or five Officers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56947:11"/>
The <hi>18th.</hi> in the Evening, the Count <hi>du
Pleſſis,</hi> Lieutenant General for the Day and
the Marqueſs <hi>de Neſle,</hi> Brigadier of Foot,
relieved the Poſts on the right with two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions
of the <hi>Marine,</hi> and the Chevalier <hi>de
Tilladet,</hi> Mareſchal <hi>de Camp,</hi> relieved the
Poſts on the left with two Batallions of the
Queens.</p>
            <p>The Redouts of this Attack are of very
good ſtone, and every where Canon-proof.
They have three ſtories of Battlements, with
a reveſted Ditch, ſixteen Foot broad, and
fourteen deep, in the Reveſtment whereof are
<hi>Caponieres,</hi> which command round about.
Theſe Redouts have communication with the
Ditch of the Place, and the covered Way, by
three Galleries under ground, built one upon
another, of ſix Foot in heighth, and four in
breadth.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>du Pleſſis</hi> viſited all the Poſts of
the Trenches. He ſent to view the Breach,
which our Canon had made in the higheſt
ſtory of the Redouts on the right, and to which
the Breaches of the Mines made an aſcent.
We found no body there: and the Count <hi>du
Pleſſis</hi> ſent thither onely ſix Granadiers and a
Serjeant, for fear there might be Mines. They
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56947:12"/>
ſaw through the Holes of the Arches, that
the Enemies kept yet the lower ſtory, and
they caſt Granadoes at them, but they were
not ſufficient to drive them away. The Count
<hi>du Pleſſis</hi> cauſed Bombs to be thrown at them,
which yet diſſipated them not, till they had
had their effect, and he ſent to charge them
with ſword in hand.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, we carried on the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work
to the Galleries of Communication from
the Redout to the Ditch, and the covered
Way of the Place, and we lodged our ſelves
by this Mining in the midſt of the ſecond
Cauſey. The Enemies, percieving the Beſiegers
ready to pierce the Communication, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to be cut off without being ſuccoured,
and retired with ſo much precipitation through
the middle Gallery into their Ditch, that they
left many Muskets, and ſome Hats in the
Redout.</p>
            <p>We rolled afterwards two great Casks, full
of Fagots into the ſecond Gallery, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Beſieged fired furiouſly upon us
from the Gate: and after two Hours fight
under ground, we ſet up a Traverſe, to hinder
their Return to the Redout.</p>
            <p>The Enemy did alſo the ſame on their ſide,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56947:12"/>
to ſtop the progreſs of our Workmen. They
had prepared four Mines at the four Corners
of the Redout: but they could not ſet them
on fire becauſe of the Water, which was in
the loweſt Gallery.</p>
            <p>We continued to batter a Breach in the
Redout on the left, to make a Mine to open
the Ditch, and to incloſe this Redout by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as we had that on the right. We made
a Lodgment on the back-ſide of <hi>Paffendal,</hi> the
length of the Traverſe, and the Face of the
Half-Moon, within four paces whereof the
Works were advanced. But we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to quit it by the abundance of Bombs,
Granadoes and Fireworks, which the Beſieged
caſt from the Half-Moon, and the covered
Way. The Communication of the two At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks
was made during the Night, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
thirty Toiſes of the Rock, which were
between the two Lodgments.</p>
            <p>The ſame day, being the <hi>19th.</hi> four Miners
were ſet to the Attack of <hi>Grondt</hi> from the
Gate unto the neareſt Tower: and they
wrought with ſo much diligence, that in the
Evening they began to charge the Mines. A
Captain of the Queens, and two or three infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Officers were wounded: five or ſix Soldiers
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56947:13"/>
were ſlain, and about twenty wounded.</p>
            <p>The <hi>19th.</hi> in the Evening, the Marqueſs <hi>de
Genlis,</hi> Lieutenant General, and the Marqueſs
<hi>de Crenan,</hi> Brigadier of Foot, mounted the
Trenches on the right hand with the Batalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Bourbonnois</hi> and <hi>Humieres,</hi> and the Sieur
<hi>de Rubantel,</hi> Mareſchal <hi>de Camp,</hi> mounted on

<hi>Vermandois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Night we extended on the right the
Lodgment, which was upon the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Redout with the ſecond covered
Way, above five and thirty Toiſes to the right,
and as much to the left: and this Logdment
was in ſome places within twelve paces of the
Palizadoes. We perfected on the left the
Lodgment which was made to incloſe the
Redout.</p>
            <p>We had proceeded very ſlowly in battering
it, becauſe we judged it not fit to finiſh the
making a Breach therein, before the Miner,
who was ſet to the exteriour Wall of the
Ditch, and who had required two Days to
open it, becauſe of the Rock he found there,
was nearer finiſhing his Work. There was
made alſo a Place of Arms, capable to contain
a thouſand or twelve hundred men in the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56947:13"/>
Trench, which communicates with the two
Lodgments.</p>
            <p>We re-eſtabliſhed with great Gabions along
the Traverſe, as far as the Point of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tergard,
the Lodgment we had there the
Night before, and which we had quitted in
the Day. The Beſieged caſt ſtore of Bombs
and Granadoes to hinder us from re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
it. The Count <hi>de Gaſſe,</hi> Colonel of
the <hi>Vermandois</hi> Regiment, who ſupported the
Head of the Work on the left, had there
twenty Granadieres kill'd or wounded. The
Enemy caſt an extraordinary Number of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes,
when we were got within an Halbards
length of the Angle of the ſecond Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp.</p>
            <p>The <hi>20th.</hi> in the morning they ſprang a
Mine, which they had under the two Angles.
That on the right overthrew twenty <hi>Gabions</hi>
without hurting above two Soldiers, and the
Damage was repaired in two hours by the
Care of the Sieur <hi>Lapara</hi> Ingenier. The Mine
on the left had not any conſiderable effect.
The Beſiegers alſo at ſeven in the morning
ſprang the Mine of <hi>Grondi:</hi> and it made a
Breach for ſix men to enter a breaſt. The
Granadiers of <hi>Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Burgundy</hi> aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56947:14"/>
firſt, with ſo much vigour, that they
drove away fifty Soldiers, which defended it,
and made ten paces beyond the Breach a
Lodgment forty Toiſes long, notwithſtanding
they were fiercely ſhot at from the Rampart,
and Ravelin of <hi>Grondt.</hi> The Captain of the
Granadiers of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and he of the Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of <hi>Languedoc</hi> two inferior Officers,
and thirty Soldiers were wounded: and there
were nine or ten Soldiers ſlain.</p>
            <p>About three in the Afternoon four Soldiers
of the Beſieged came into the Camp: and
they averred, that the Beſiegers had kill'd or
wounded them ſince the Siege above three
hundred Men: that Captain <hi>Gregory,</hi> a famous
Officer amongſt them for commanding of
Parties, was kill'd: and not the Major of the
Town, as the report went: that the Prince <hi>de
Chimay</hi> made the Women and Children work
upon the Retirades, and that he was ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to make a vigorous Defence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>20th.</hi> in the Evening the Sieur <hi>de Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euſe,</hi>
Lieutenant General, and the Marqueſs <hi>de
Neſle,</hi> Brigadier of Foot, mounted the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
on the right with two Batallions of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne:</hi>
and the Marqueſs <hi>de Renti,</hi> Mareſchal
<hi>de Camp,</hi> mounted on the left with a Batallion
of <hi>la Ferte,</hi> and one of <hi>Orleans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:56947:14"/>
We extended, during the Night, a great Line,
which made the Place of Arms, from one Redout
to the other; and we put it into condition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
above three thouſand Men. On the left
the Lodgment, which was along the Traverſe,
was continued to the middle of the Face of
the Countergard, notwithſtanding the Enemies
fired all Night briskly upon us with Muskets,
Bombs and Granadoes.</p>
            <p>We began alſo a Platform on the right to
look backwards into the covered Way of the
Place, and there were ſeven or eight Soldiers
kill'd, and about thirty wounded, with two
Officers. The Count <hi>de Tonnerre,</hi> Colonel of
the Regiment of <hi>Orleans,</hi> was wounded in the
Head.</p>
            <p>The <hi>21ſt.</hi> at three in the Afternoon the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
quitted the Redout on the left hand,
ſeeing that it was entirely incloſed by the
Works of the Beſiegers, and ſeeing alſo the
great Breach their Canon had made therein.
They retired into the Caponiers of the Ditch
of the ſame Redout, and from thence fired
fircely upon thoſe that were in it. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
put two Pieces in battery to drive them
thence.</p>

               <hi>Geran,</hi> Lieutenant General, and the Sieur <hi>de

of the Trenches on the right with two Batal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of <hi>Navarre:</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xelles,</hi>
Mareſchal <hi>de Camp,</hi> relieved it on the left,
with the Batallion of <hi>Vaubecourt,</hi> and that of
<hi>Conti,</hi> at the Head whereof is the Prince <hi>de

            </p>
            <p>About ſeven a Clock, the Enemy ſprang a
Mine between two Lodgments, which the
Beſigers had upon the Reverſe of <hi>Paffendal:</hi>
but it neither kill'd nor hurt any body.</p>
            <p>At <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Miner was put to the middle
of the Countergard, which covers the Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Beſieged, an hour after, ſprang a
ſecond Mine on the ſame ſide. There were
three Soldiers kill'd, and ſix or ſeven wounded.
Some time before we had diſcovered a Mine
in the Redout on the right hand, and taken
out the Powder. During the Night, we brought
a Battery of ſeven Pieces within thirty paces of
the Counterſcarp: and perfected the Platform
and Place of Arms, which joins the two
Redouts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>22d.</hi> at break of Day, the Canon of
the great Battery of <hi>Paffendal,</hi> fired by Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
at the Countergard, and there were
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56947:16"/>
two Miners kill'd, and three others wounded,
with a Lieutenant of the Regiment of <hi>Conti,</hi>
and three Soldiers. Four Soldiers of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of <hi>Conti,</hi> animated by the Preſence
and Liberalities of the Prince, who executes
all the Functions of a Colonel, continued to
work in the Mine, whence many had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed
by the Enemies fierce Firing.</p>
            <p>The Miners found at Nine in the Morning
a Gallery in the Wall of the Countergard,
pierced with Battlements, which flanked the
Reverſe, and ſeized thereon. They found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
underneath, which cut the Countergard
acroſs, and which gave us room to put ten
Miners into this laſt, to make therein as many
Branches, to the end to caſt a part of the
Earth into the Ditch.</p>
            <p>The Enemy, having percieved the Work
of our Miners, caſt ineffectually great ſtore of
Fireworks, and Barrels full of Powder, to
drive them away, and to oblige the Beſiegers
to quit the Lodgment. The ſame Morning
the Prince <hi>de Conti,</hi> cauſed to be attach'd by a
Captain, who commanded ſixty Men of his
Regiment, a Traverſe, which the Beſieged
poſſeſs'd in the Fauxbourg of <hi>Paffendal,</hi> fifty
paces from their Gate, for to goe ſecurely to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56947:17"/>
fetch Water at the River. The Enemies were
driven from this Traverſe, although they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
very ſtoutly: and we ſeized of an Out-Gate
of the Town, fortified with good
Towers.</p>
            <p>About Eleven in the Morning, we knew, that
the Enemies had made many Traverſes within
their Counterſcarp, and the Beſiegers, doeing
their utmoſt to hinder their finiſhing this
Work, made themſelves Maſters of the firſt
Redan on the right, and that on the left.</p>
            <p>The Beſieged endeavoured to drive them
thence with a ſhower of Granadoes and Stones:
but it was without any Succeſs, and they were
alſo in fine repulſed by the great Firing and
Extraordinary Vigour of the Beſiegers.</p>
            <p>During the Guard, about twenty Soldiers
were ſlain, and there were four Officers, one
Ingenier, and forty or fifty Soldiers wounded.
at the Attack of <hi>Grondt,</hi> during the Night of
the <hi>21ſt.</hi> to the <hi>22d.</hi> and all this Day, the
Beſiegers laboured to get ground on the right,
leaving the Ravelin on the left, and they
brought Canon to ruine the Communication
of the Gate with the Caſtle, which they batter
inceſſantly.</p>
            <p>The Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> continues to viſit
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56947:17"/>
and preſs the Works, and to give all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
neceſſary for advancing the Siege, with
all the Vigilance and good Conduct ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.</p>
            <p>There arrive daily at the Camp many No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
ſtrangers, whom Curioſity, excited
by the report, which is ſpread about of the
Beauty of this Sieges Works, and of the good
Order of the Attacks, brings thither from all
the neighbouring Countries.</p>
            <p>The Enemies have done their utmoſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the putting ſome Succour into the
Place.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Valſaſſine</hi> and the Duke <hi>de
Bejar</hi> undertook to get in at the Head of four
Hundred reformed Officers and three Hundred
Dragoons: and they came within three
Leagues of the Place. But having learnt
from the Guides of the Countrey, the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of our Works, and that it would be
impoſſible to execute their Deſign, they retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and took their way to <hi>Bruxelles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Works, which have all been conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Sieur <hi>de Vauban</hi> with ſuch Succeſs,
that they have hindred the Enemy from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any Sally, are in very good Condition.
They would have been farther advanced, had
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56947:18"/>
not the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> according to the
King's Orders, ordered the Attacks with all
the Precautions, neceſſary to ſpare the Troops,
and moderate the Ardour of our Gentry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the <hi>22d.</hi> in the Evening, the Marqueſs
<hi>de Lambert,</hi> Lieutenant General, and the Sieur
<hi>de Refuge,</hi> Brigadier of Foot, relieved the Poſts
on the right hand of the Trenches with two
Batallions of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> The Sieur <hi>de Langal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie,</hi>
Mareſchal <hi>de-Camp,</hi> relieved the Poſts
on the left with one Batallion of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> and
two Batallions of the Royal.</p>
            <p>During the Night and the following Day,
our Men wrought on the right hand upon a
Battery of three Pieces of Canon againſt the
Palizadoes of the Counterſcarp, for to batter
the Face of the Baſtion of that ſide, and that
of the Half-Moon, which is on the left, and
for to diſmount a Piece of Canon, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
had put there a little while ſince. We
began alſo a Battery of Mortar-pieces behind
the firſt Battery, for to hinder the Firing which
the Beſieged made from the Baſtion and Half-Moon.</p>
            <p>The two Lodgments of the Beſiegers were
lengthned: and there were finiſhed two or
three and twenty Mines in the Countergard,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56947:18"/>
to be made uſe of, when we ſhould have ſeen
the effect of three others, which had been
made at the point of this Countergard. The
Enemies caſt, during the Night, a great Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Granadoes and Fireworks upon the
Workmen; and into the firſt Poſts, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard
the Works. But in the Day, the Beſiegers
fired ſo fiercely, that it hindred them from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to ſhoot: and the Work went on
without any oppoſition. There was made at
the Attack of old <hi>Munſter</hi> a Battery of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-pieces,
for to endeavour to drive the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
out of the third part, which was left
them of the Caſtle, and to make a Lodgment
there without much loſs. At the Attack of
<hi>Grondt,</hi> the Houſes whereof the Beſieged had
this Night burnt, the Works went ſtill on:
leaving on the left the Ravelin, which they
poſſeſt, and puſhing towards the Gate of the
Caſtle of <hi>Munſter,</hi> which was in the mean
time continually battered by our Canon. The
Marqueſs <hi>de Montpeſat</hi> was kill'd at this guard,
this Day in the Morning. We loſt there an
Ingenier with ten or twelve Soldiers: and
there were two Captains of Foot and three
inferior Officers wounded, with fifty Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:56947:19"/>
The ſame <hi>23d.</hi> in the Evening the Count <hi>du
Pleſſis,</hi> Lieutenant General, and the Sieur <hi>de
Morton,</hi> Brigadier of Foot, relieved the Poſts
of the Trenches on the right with a Batallion
of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and that of <hi>Soiſſons.</hi> The Sieur
<hi>d'Erlac,</hi> Mareſchal <hi>de Camp,</hi> relieved the
Poſts on the left with the Batallions of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onnois</hi>
and <hi>Turenne.</hi> In the Night we extended
and perfected the two Lodgments on the
Counterſcarp: and we wrought to make the
Communication of the one with the other.
The Beſieged ſprang a Mine under the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the left: but no body was hurt by it,
becauſe our men were retired to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from a very great Number of Granadoes
and Fireworks, which the Enemies caſt there
during the ſpace of two Hours. We reſetled
our ſelves there afterwards, much better than
we were before. At ſix in the Morning, the
Enemies pretended they would make a Sally:
but they durſt not advance, having ſeen our
Granadiers march towards them with great
reſolution. An hour after, the Battery of three
Pieces of Canon began to play: and at the
ſame time we caſt ſtore of Bombs from the
Battery of Mortar-pieces, which was behind
it. The fifth of theſe Bombs fell upon two
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56947:19"/>
or three thouſand Granadoes, which were in
their Half-Moon, and ſet them on fire. The
Fire was very great for above an Hour: and
we ſaw in the Air abundance of Hats and
Pieces of Clothes: which made us judge,
that many of the Enemies were kill'd and
wounded.</p>
            <p>The <hi>24th.</hi> our Men charged the Mines of
the Countergard: and we battered with two
Pieces of Canon the Caponieres, which are in
the Ditch, that runs along the right ſide of this
Work. The great Battery of <hi>Paffendal</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to batter a Breach in the Face of the
Caſtle, which looks toward this <hi>Fauxbourg:</hi>
and we continued alſo to caſt therein ſtore of
Bombs with good Succeſs. The Beſieged
poſſeſs'd no more of the Counterſcarp, but
the Redan, which covers the Half-Moon, and
the two Parties were ſo near one another, that
the Enemies with Hooks pluckt away our Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bions
and Fagots, and drew them into their
Ditches. Theſe great Progreſſes began to
ſhake the Beſieged. Two Run-aways, come
from the Place to the Camp, affirmed, that
the Colonels and a part of the Officers of the
Garriſon ſpake of capitulating to preſerve
their Soldiers: the Beſieged having then loſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56947:20"/>
above ſix hundred Men, kill'd or wounded
by our Bombs, or by ſhot from the Trenches.
Theſe Fugitives added, that the Inhabitants, and
the Women inceſſantly beſought the Prince <hi>de
Chimay</hi> to prevent by a Capitulation the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
whereunto they ſhould be expoſed, if
they expected the laſt Extremities. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
loſt at this guard the Sieur <hi>de Valorge,</hi>
Captain of the Granadiers of <hi>Lyonnois,</hi> with
eleven Soldiers. An Ingenier, two inferior
Officers, and about forty Soldiers were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
My Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Son to the Earl of
<hi>Carlile,</hi> who was a Volunteer, was mortally
wounded, as he was giving Marks of a great
Courage.</p>
            <p>The <hi>24th.</hi> in the Evening, the Marqueſs <hi>de
Genlis</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Neſle</hi> mounted on
the right hand of the Trenches with two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallions
of the <hi>Marine:</hi> and the Count <hi>de Brog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi>
mounted on the left with two Batallions of
the Queens. In the Night the Enemies fired
very fiercely to drive the Beſiegers from their
Lodgments, who yet failed not to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
there. They made alſo an Attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Miners of the Countergard: and
were repelled with the loſs of ſome Soldiers.
The Beſiegers abandoned the Attack of <hi>Grondt,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56947:20"/>
after they had drawn thence their Canon. At
the Attack of the Caſtle of Old <hi>Munſter,</hi> we
brought two Pieces of Canon, wherewith we
made a Breach of twelves paces in the Gate,
which the Beſieged held: and we made two
Batteries of Mortar-pieces, which continually
caſt Bombs there. There was at this Guard
five or ſix Soldiers kill'd, and about twenty
wounded.</p>
            <p>In the Evening of the <hi>25th.</hi> the Sieur <hi>de
Joyeuſe</hi> mounted on the right with <hi>Bourbonnois</hi>
and <hi>Humieres:</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de Renty</hi> on
the left with the Crown and <hi>Vermandois.</hi> The
Beſieged at the beginning of the Night caſt
ſo great a quantity of Fireworks, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
had no ſmall difficulty to preſerve the
Powder they carried to charge the Mines.
They had already burnt two of our Soldiers,
who carried ſome in Bags. The Beſiegers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
three covered Ways upon the Reverſe of
<hi>Paffendal</hi> between the Place, and the three
Redouts, for to goe to the Breach of the
Countergard, when it ſhould be made. They
continued to batter a Breach in the Point of
the Half-Moon: to ruine the Caponieres of
the Ditch of the Countergard: and to extend
the Mine-work to the right and left of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56947:21"/>
Redan of the Counterſcarp, which the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
were in fine obliged to quit. There
was at this guard a Captain of Foot, and ten
or twelve Soldiers ſlain, and about twenty
Soldiers wounded.</p>
            <p>The <hi>26th.</hi> in the Evening, the Count <hi>de</hi> St.
<hi>Geran,</hi> and the Duke <hi>de la Ferte</hi> relieved the
Poſts of the Trenches on the right with two
Batallions of <hi>Champagne</hi> and the Chevalier <hi>de
Tilladet</hi> relieved the Poſts on the left with the
Batallions of <hi>la Ferte, Conde</hi> and <hi>Orleans.</hi> The
Batallion of <hi>Enguien</hi> went on the ſide of the
Caſtle. During the Night, the Beſiegers fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
the three Ways begun on the Reverſe of
<hi>Paffendal.</hi> They carried on the Mine-work,
as far as the Bottom of the Ditch of the
Countergard: and they wrought at the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
of the Ditch of the Half-Moon, in the
point whereof there was already a Breach for
two Men to get up a breaſt. There was not
however any appearance of hazarding to get
up by this Breach, though it had been even
greater, becauſe we were aſſured that there
were Mines there: and becauſe it was but in
the firſt Envelop of the Half-Moon, which
was double. The Beſieged ſprang two Mines
in the laſt Redan of the Counterſcarp. The
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56947:21"/>
firſt had not any effect: and the other kill'd
three Soldiers, and wounded nine or ten.</p>
            <p>The <hi>27th.</hi> in the Morning, we finiſht the
charging of the Mine: and we made the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
be carried by Soldiers diſguiſed like Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.
We made them be thus diſguiſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we had for ſome time obſerved that the
Beſieged ſhot not much at the Laborers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that they were Countrymen therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
whom the Beſiegers conſtrained to
work. We employed our ſelves diligently in
cloſing the Mine, and diſpoſed all things with
great care for ſpringing it the morrow Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and for mounting afterwards to the
Breach. There were ten Soldiers kill'd, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twenty wounded.</p>
            <p>The <hi>27th.</hi> in the Evening the Marqueſs <hi>de
Lambert</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de Rubantel</hi> relieved the
Poſts of the Trenches on the right with two
Batallions of <hi>Navarre:</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de Joſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux</hi>
relieved the Poſts on the left, with the
Batallions of <hi>Vaubecourt,</hi> of <hi>Conti,</hi> and <hi>Auverg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</hi>
During the Night, according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> we made all
the Preparatives neceſſary for the Attack,
which was to be made the morrow Morning
upon the Countergard: and things were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56947:22"/>
with ſo much Prudence, that never any
Action was begun and continued with better
Order, leſs Confuſion, more Conſtancy, and
greater Succeſs. At break of Day, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>de la Freſeliere</hi> put the Batteries in ſo
good Eſtate, that the Canon of the Beſiegers
played inceſſantly for two Hours. The Sieur
<hi>de Vigny</hi> cauſed alſo the Batteries of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-pieces
to be ordered with ſo much care,
that the Bombs, which fell with diſcontinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into the Baſtions, tormented the Beſieged.
At the ſame time, the Troops, which were to
be employed upon this Attack, marched to
the Rendezvous, aſſigned them by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
<hi>de Crequi:</hi> who, notwithſtanding his
Indiſpoſition, and an Inciſion, which had been
made in his Leg the Day before, cauſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be carried to the Head of the Trenches,
that he might there be nearer at hand to give
his Orders, and might put more Life into
what was to be executed. The Granadiers of
<hi>Vaubecourt</hi> were deſtined to attack the right
Side of the Countergard of the Baſtion of
<hi>Barlemont,</hi> after the Mine ſhould have had its
effect: being ſeconded by the two Companies
of Granadiers of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and by an hundred
Men of the Regiment of <hi>Vaubecourt,</hi> which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56947:22"/>
had at their Head the Company of Granadiers
of the Regiment of <hi>Auvergne.</hi> The Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of <hi>Conti</hi> were commanded to attack a
Redan, ruined by our Canon, on the left ſide
of the Countergard being backt by two
Companies of Granadiers of <hi>Normandy,</hi> one of
the Royal, and an hundred Men of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
of <hi>Conti.</hi> The two Companies of the
Granadiers of <hi>Navarre</hi> were appointed their
Poſt on the left hand of the Attack of <hi>Conti,</hi>
over againſt the Buttreſs of the Baſtion of
<hi>Barlemont:</hi> being ſeconded by the Companies
of Granadiers of the <hi>Marine,</hi> of <hi>Bourbonnois,</hi>
and of <hi>Rouergue,</hi> with an hundred Men of
that Regiment. Each Regiment in a Body
was to ſupport its Attack, except that of the
Granadiers of <hi>Navarre,</hi> which was maintained
by the Batallion of <hi>Rouergue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Laborers were ranged in three Troops,
with the Ingeniers, to be ready to march
when the detached Troops ſhould have ſeized
on the Breaches: and it was in fine reſolved,
that aſſoon as the ſecond Mine was ſprung,
they ſhould march by the Ways, which were
ſhewn them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> All things being thus diſpoſed,
about four in the Morning all the Troops
that were at the foremoſt Poſts, were cauſed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56947:23"/>
to withdraw from the Trenches, to the end
they might be out of the Fall of the Ruines,
which the Mine might make. The Miners
were alſo made go out of their Hole: and
there were left onely the Pikes planted with
the Colors, and ſome Soldiers, to hinder the
Enemy from knowing the deſign of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>28th.</hi> about ſeven in the Morning, the
Mine was ſprung: and its Effect was very
conſiderable. Nevertheleſs the Aſcent of the
Countergard, and the other Works, was ſo
rough and difficult, that the detached Men,
who attacht at the ſame time, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
might not have leiſure to retrench them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
were obliged to ſcramble, and thruſt
one another, to get to the Top of the
Breach.</p>
            <p>The Troops being advanced to ſeize on the
Breaches, and make Lodgments there, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as it had been propoſed, thoſe, which
marched firſt, extended themſelves under the
Baſtion on the left, where were thrown at
them a great Number of Granadoes. The
others which followed them, extended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
along the Curtain, and the Baſtion on
the right at the Foot of the Breach: after
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56947:23"/>
which they aſcended together with much
order to the Top of the Breach, to ſettle
themſelves there. But thoſe, who advanced
to the end of the Curtain, which joins the
Baſtion on the left, met with a vigorous
oppoſition.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time the Enemy ſprang two
Mines in this place, which obliged the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Men to retire to preſerve themſelves:
but having preſently recovered the right hand
of theſe Mines with the other Troops, they
chaſed thence the Beſieged, and began on all
ſides to ſettle the Lodgments by means of
abundance of Fagots, which were inceſſantly
brought thither. The Troops, which were in
the Baſtion on the left, to reſettle themſelves
there, were diſquieted by the Granadoes,
which the Beſieged caſt alſo from the ſide of
the Ditch. But we cauſed them to be driven
by ſome Officers and Soldiers as far as the
Wall, which is on the left, that goes down
from the Place to the Ditch, and flanks the
Baſtion of <hi>Barlemont,</hi> where they laboured to
retrench themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Beſieged in their Retreat ſet on fire a little
Magazene fill'd with Bombs, Granadoes and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whereby many of the Beſiegers were kill'd
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56947:24"/>
or wounded. Four Companies of <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Foot defended the Countergard, and the
other Works, which are joined thereunto,
were defended by Detachments. They made
ſo obſtinate a Defence, that our Troops,
though uſing their utmoſt endeavours, had for
half an hour much difficulty to get poſſeſſion
of the Top of the Breach: the place of it
ſelf being very high, and the Ruines of the
Mine not being ſolid enough to make it firm.
But after a fierce Charge of Muskets and
Granadoes, our Men ſo vigorouſly diſputed
the matter with the Swords point, that the
Enemy was with much loſs driven from this
Poſt: and many <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who would not
ask Quarter, were cut in pieces. Some, carried
on with an extreme deſire of ſignalizing
themſelves, went as far as the Ditch of the
Place. The Lieutenant of the Granadiers of
<hi>Rouergue,</hi> followed by ten or twelve, bore up
with great Conſtancy againſt the Charge of
forty Maſters: and the greateſt part of the
Horſe was kill'd, and the reſt put to flight by
help of the Firing of the Granadiers, which
were in the Countergard. The Commandant
was alſo kill'd by the Count <hi>de Mailly,</hi> who
went to meet him, having ſeen him advance
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56947:24"/>
his Sword on high. Our Men would have
made a Lodgment near the Ditch over againſt
the right hand Front of the Baſtion; but the
extraordinary Firing of the Beſieged, which
kill'd us ſome men, obliged them to take the
reſolution to retire along the Battlements of
the Wall. The Beſieged had placed three
little Pieces on the Terraces, covered with
Trees, on the ſide of <hi>Grondt,</hi> having judged
that they ſhould be attackt thereabouts: and
the Troops, which they played upon in the
flank, were very much incommoded by them:
as alſo by the Ordnance, which they had on
the Flank of the Baſtion oppoſite to that of
<hi>Barlemont.</hi> There was not for five or ſix hours
any intermiſſion of Firing. We loſt twenty
or five and twenty Officers, with about three-ſcore
and ten Soldiers: and there were many
wounded, amongſt whom was the Chevalier
<hi>de Megrigny,</hi> and the Sieur <hi>de Marny</hi> Ingenier.
The Captains of the Granadiers of <hi>Bourbonnois</hi>
and <hi>Conti</hi> were kill'd. The Sieur <hi>de Sainte
Marthe,</hi> Captain of the Granadiers of <hi>Auverg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
and the Sieur <hi>de Caſtillon,</hi> Captain of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi>
were wounded. The Marqueſs <hi>Bourle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
Brother to the Duke of <hi>d' Atri,</hi> was ſlain.
The Duke <hi>de Choiſeut</hi> was wounded with the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56947:25"/>
ſhiver of a Bomb above the left Eye, whereof
he died ſome Days after: and the Vidame <hi>de
Laon,</hi> Son to the Count <hi>du Roy,</hi> was wounded
with a Musket-ſhot through the Body, both
of them giving Teſtimonies of a ſingular
Courage.</p>
            <p>The Prince <hi>de Conti,</hi> and the Prince <hi>de la
Roche ſur-Yon</hi> expoſed themſelves to the greateſt
danger with a Valour worthy their Birth, and
the laſt received on the Stomach a blow with
a Stone. All the Volunteers ſignalized them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
there, particularly the Prince <hi>de Tingry,</hi>
the Marqueſs <hi>de Crequi,</hi> the Count <hi>de Luz,</hi> the
Count <hi>d' Eſtrees,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Thiange,</hi> the
Marqueſs <hi>de Nogent,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>de la
Batie.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Grafton,</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> his Brother, and many other
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords, who came to the Siege in
Quality of Volunteers, ſignalized themſelves
on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>The Sieur <hi>de Vauban,</hi> Mareſchal <hi>de Camp,</hi>
was one of the firſt in the Countergard, and
gave there with his ordinary Sufficiency Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
very beneficial for the Security and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of the Lodgments, which were made
there.</p>
            <p>All the Foot, which were at this Action,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56947:25"/>
acquitted themſelves very well of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vois:
and many Soldiers made themſelves be
taken notice of.</p>
            <p>It was neceſſary, after the effect of the
Mine, and the Lodgment built upon the
Countergard, to make a Deſcent into the
Ditch. The Count <hi>du Pleſſis,</hi> Lieutenant
General for the Day, undertook this Care
with all the Succeſs, that could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
            <p>He made the Ditch be viewed. He kill'd
or put to flight all the Enemies that were
found before him: and afterward cauſed the
Lodgments to be made, notwithſtanding all
the Effects of the Beſieged, who caſt from
above the Baſtions a prodigious quantity of
Granadoes, Bombs and Fireworks upon the
Workmen, and Soldiers. He received under
the Elbow a blow with the glancing of a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado,
which made him for ſome time unable
to ſtir it. He ceaſed not to continue preſent
at the Work of the Lodgment, till ſuch time
as it was extended from the Gate of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery
of the Countergard, which leads to the
Ditch, as far as the Baſtion of <hi>Barlemont:</hi>
which made fifteen Toiſes. Two hours after,
he put the Miners to work in two places, one
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56947:26"/>
upon the right towards the Point of the
Baſtion, and the other on the left, drawing
towards the Flank, the Enemy not being able
to incommode them.</p>
            <p>The Works were continued the <hi>30th.</hi> and
the <hi>31ſt.</hi> with much Succeſs: and we will
give you the particular thereof in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Relations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the <hi>29th.</hi> in the Evening the Count <hi>du
Pleſſis,</hi> Lieutenant General, mounted the fifth
time the Trenches: and made the Deſcent of
the Ditch with very good Succeſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>30th.</hi> in the Morning, we attackt the
third Diviſion of the Caſtle of Old <hi>Munſter:</hi>
and made our ſelves Maſters of it after ſome
reſiſtance of the Enemies. They ſoon quitted
this Work to retire upon the Rampart, hoping
by their fierce Firing to hinder our Men from
lodging there. About two in the Afternoon, a
Company of the Granadiers of <hi>Rouergue,</hi> one
of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and two of <hi>Fuzeliers,</hi> ſupported
by a Batallion of that Regiment, wholly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
this Caſtle. The Beſieged had raiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the Diviſion a Battery of three Pieces.
We could not goe to them above ſeven or
eight a breaſt: and we were expoſed to the
ſhot of the Place. Nevertheleſs they abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56947:26"/>
this Poſt near half an hour before the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers
came againſt it, and left there their
Canon all charged. Our Men made after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
many winding Traverſes to lodge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſafely upon the Brink of the Ditch:
where they extended themſelves, as much as
the Ground-work could permit. An Ingenier,
and fourteen or fifteen Soldiers were kill'd
upon this occaſion, and there were about forty
wounded. About five in the Evening the
Enemies quitted the Half-Moon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tergard,
which they ſtill held at the great
Attack. The General Officers of the Guard,
having been advertiſed thereof, thought fit,
before they ſeiſed this Work, to ſend ſome
Men by the Breach, which was at the Point of
the Countergard, to ſee whether there were
no Mines, and to open thoſe they ſhould find
there. There were happily diſcovered under
the Countergard the Trains of thirteen or
fourteen Toiſes of Mines, which were all
charged. We took thence the Powder, and
we detached Workmen to make a Lodgment,
which exteriorly embraced all the-Parapets.
We delayed to put People into the Half-Moon
till we had had time to ſearch the Mines,
which was done the following Night. We
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56947:27"/>
found there two Pieces of Canon, which the
Enemies had left, and we judged thereby that
Fear had made them retire from this Half-Moon.
The Sieur <hi>Pariſoc,</hi> Major of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
Ingenier, was wounded with a Piece of a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado
on the Stomach, as he was ſetting the
Miner to the Baſtion of the Place.</p>
            <p>The <hi>30th.</hi> in the Evening, The Sieur <hi>de
Toyeuſe,</hi> Lieutenant General, the Sieru <hi>d' Erloc,</hi>
and the Marqueſs <hi>de Neſle</hi> relieved the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
with two Batallions of the Marine, and
two of the Queens. We finiſht, during the
Night a Battery of two Pieces of Canon, which
had been begun upon the Countergard on
the left: and we carried on by the Mine-work
about twenty Toiſes of a Trench, drawing
from the Countergard to the Curtain, which
is on the Reverſe of <hi>Paffendal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>31ſt.</hi> we continued to work to make
the Deſcent of the Ditch: and to erect a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
of three Pieces of Canon on the ſame
Ditch, which were to play with another Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
of ſeven Pieces, which had begun in the
Morning to fire briskly againſt a Baſtion,
which remained before the Beſiegers, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them from entring the Place. We
wrought alſo upon all that was neceſſary for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56947:27"/>
the ſpringing ſeveral Mines, to the end to
give afterwards the Aſſault, in caſe the Enemies
ſhewed no Deſign to yield.</p>
            <p>But the Prince <hi>de Chimay,</hi> knowing that
the Town was no longer defenſible, and ſeeing
himſelf preſſed by the Principal Officers of the
Garriſon and by the Townſmen, to prevent
the Misfortunes, which befall a Place, taken
by aſſault, cauſed <hi>June</hi> the <hi>1ſt.</hi> a Parley to be
beaten, and demanded to capitulate. Hoſtages
were ſoon ſent on both ſides, and all Acts of
Hoſtility ceaſed. The Prince <hi>de Chimay</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
a Truce for ſome Days, that he might
ſend to <hi>Bruxelles,</hi> to repreſent to the Marqueſs
<hi>de Grana</hi> the Extremity wherein he was. He
added thereunto ſome other Requeſts, but
the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi</hi> thought not fit to
grant him any of them. The Truce was thus
broken, and the ſame Evening the Beſieged and
the Beſiegers began to fire upon one another.</p>
            <p>The <hi>2d.</hi> we perceived a white Cloth,
whereby the Townſmen would declare, that
they would no longer defend themſelves, nor
ſhoot any more. But the Garriſon ceaſed not
to fire at us with their Muskets all the Night,
and our Men fired alſo briskly both their
Musket and Canon to anſwer them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:56947:28"/>
The <hi>3d.</hi> the Firing of the Beſieged dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
by degrees till ten a Clock, when they
entirely left off to ſhoot and appear. They
were above half an hour in this Condition:
and in fine, ſeeing that the Beſiegers erected
in the Ditch a Battery of four great Pieces,
they made appear at the Attack, where the
Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> was, ſome Men who made a
ſhew of deſiring to ſpeak. We could ſcarce
make them leave firing on our ſide, that we
might hear them. They ſaid, that the Beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
had beaten a Parley on the ſide of the
Caſtle: and deſired, that we would not level
our Canon. They were anſwered, that the
Beſieged ſhould beat the Parley on the ſide,
where they cauſed their Battery to be erected,
and that they ſhould ceaſe working. They
ſaid, they expected a Drum: in the mean time
the Work was diſcontinued, and in fine the
Drum arrived. He cried out, after he had
beaten, that they had made this call to capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate.
Some time after the Hoſtages were
brought to the Guard of the Trenches, where
the Prince <hi>de Conti</hi> was; and he ſent them to
the Mareſchal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> who ſent alſo his
into the Town. The Deputies arrived after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
at the Camp with the Articles of Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56947:28"/>
which the Prince <hi>de Chimay</hi> demanded.
There was one in favour of the Deſerters of
our Troops, for whom the Beſieged demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Amneſty; and another to obtain four
Pieces of Canon, which were not granted.</p>
            <p>After many difficulties the Capitulation was
in fine regulated and Signed: the Extract
whereof follows.</p>
