            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SCAENE.</head>
                  <p>THe first thing that presented it selfe to the sight, was a rich Ornament, that enclosed the Scaene; in the upper part of which, were great branches of Foliage growing out of leaves and huskes, with a Coronice at the top; and in the midst was placed a large Compartiment composed of Groteske worke, wherein were Harpies with wings and Lyons clawes, and their hinder parts converted into leaves and branches: over all was a broken Frontispice, wrought with scrowles and masque heads of Children; and within this a Table adorn'd with a lesser Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiment, with this Inscription, <hi>COELVM BRITANNICVM.</hi> The two sides of this Ornament were thus ordered: First from the ground arose a square Basement, and on the Plinth stood a great vaze of gold, richly enchased, and beautified with Sculptures of great Releine, with frutages hanging from the upper-part: At the foot of this sate two youths naked, in their naturall colours; each of these with one arme supported the Vaze; on the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of which stood two young women in Draperies, arme in arme; the one figuring the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7793:108"/>
glory of Princes, and the other Mansuetude: their other armes bore up an Ovall, in which, to the Kings Majesty was this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prese, A Lyon with an Imperiall Crowne on his head; the word, <hi>Animum sub pectore forti:</hi> On the other side was the like Composition, but the designe of the Figures varied; and in the Oval on the top, being borne up by Nobility and Fecundity, was this Imprese to the Queens Majesty, A Lilly growing with branches and leaves, and three lesser Lillies springing out of the Stemme; the Word, <hi>Semper inclita Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> All this Ornament was heightned with Gold, and for the Invention, and various composition was the newest and most gracious that hath beene done in this place.</p>
                  <p>The Curtaine was watchet, and a pale yellow in paines, which flying up on the sudden, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Scaene, representing old Arches, old Palaces, decayed wals, parts of Temples, Theaters, Basilita's and Therme, with confused heaps of broken Columnes, Bases, Coronices and Statues, lying as under-ground, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther resembling the ruines of some great Citie of the ancient Romans, or civiliz'd Brittaines. This strange prospect detayn'd the eyes of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators sometime, when to a loud Musick <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> descends; on the upper part of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot stands a Cocke in action of crowing: his habit was a Coat of flame colour girt to him, and a white Mantle trimm'd with gold and silver; upon his head a wreath with small fals of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7793:108"/>
white Feathers, a Caduseus in his hand, and wings at his heeles: being come to the ground he dismounts, and goes up to the State.</p>

                  <p>The Revels being past, and the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie seated under the State by the Queene; for Conclusion to this Masque there appeares com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming forth from one of the sides, as moving by a gentle wind, a great Cloud, which arriving at the middle of the heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> stayeth; this was of severall colours, and so great, that it covered the whole Scaene. Out of the further part of the heaven begins to breake forth two other clouds, differing in colour and shape; and being fully discovered there appeared sitting in one of them, Religion, Truth, and Wisdome. Religion was apparelled in white, and part of her face was covered with a light vaile, in one hand a Booke, and in the other a flame of fire. Truth in a Watchet Robe, a Sunne upon her fore-head and bearing in her hand a Palme, Wisedome in a mantle wrought with eyes and hands, g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

her head: Government was figured in a coat of Armour, bearing a shield, and on it a <hi>Medu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa's</hi> head; upon her head a plumed helme, and in her right hand a Lance. Reputation, a young man in a purple robe wrought with gold, and wearing a laurell wreath on his head. These being come downe in an equall distance to the middle part of the Ayre, the great Cloud began to breake open, out of which stroke beames of light; in the midst suspended in the Ayre, sate Eternity on a Globe, his Garment was long of a light blue, wrought all over with Stars of gold, and bearing in his hand a Serpent bent into a circle, with his tayle in his mouth. In the firmament about him, was a troope of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene stars, expressing the stellifying of our Brittish Heroes; but one more great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent than the rest, which was over his head, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured his Majestie. And in the lower part was seene a farre off the prospect of <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle, the famous seat of the most honourable Order of the Garter.</p>
