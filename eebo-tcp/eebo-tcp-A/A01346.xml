            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Nabal
to feast like a King;</hi> for <hi>homo quidam</hi> as <hi>Diues</hi> was
called, a certaine rich man, to fare daintily <hi>quoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi>
he is the Belly-God, and this is his Idolatry;
whose Kitchin is his Temple, whose Priest is the
Cooke, whose Table is the Altar, and whose meat
his Sacrifice which he daily offers vp to that god,
as the Babilonians sometime did to their Idoll
<hi>Bel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So weighty is the Idolatry of the backe, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereon whole Farmes and Mannor-Houses
that <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> said, it was a a meruaile

Augustus</hi> the Emperour tearmed this vanity <hi>vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illum
superbiae, nidumque luxuriae,</hi> they are tokens
of a naked and a wanton minde, which because
their soules want that inward clothing of grace
and <hi>good workes</hi> must thus like Sepulchers paint

they are fruitlesse twigs that aspire aloft
when the fertile bowes humbly descend to the
earth. They who thus vainely set out their bodies
as it were to sale, meerely discouer the pouerty of
their spirits.</p>
            <p>It is a pretty picture that points out an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>-man
naked, with a Taylor standing by with a
paire of Sheeres in his hand, ready to shape him
into any dresse, sometimes he is <hi>French</hi> alone,
then <hi>Spanish,</hi> then <hi>Dutch,</hi> then <hi>Italian,</hi> then alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
like them all, and in all so vnlike himselfe,
that when the true God that made him comes to
see him, hee must needs say <hi>Non novi,</hi> depart
from me, you have so disguised and mishapen
your selues, as I doe not know you.</p>
            <p>Their faithfull Taylors are the Priests to these
Idolaters, and their Bills their Bibles, which
sometime for want of discharging they keepe by
them, but when they are payd, they profanely cut
them in pieces, but yet so happy are their Priests,
that their tenths grow to a greater heape in the
close, then all their Patrons 9. parts besides.</p>
            <p>But there may bee some reasons for these Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latryes,

these Beads-men, as they will not be at the charge
of a Priest, themselues will doe that office, or at
least they doe as <hi>Micah,</hi> Iudg. 17. Consecrate one
of their Sonnes, who looking to their Temples
and golden Gods, sometime play false with them,
as <hi>Micah</hi> with his Mother, and they with others;

the sorrow of their heart, their sonnes like those

to satisfie his mistresse, which is his Saint,
and the onely matter of his Religion.</p>
            <p>Thus wee violate the two first Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
now for the third and fourth, let our hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

to issue afresh, witnesse: Words come not faster
then oathes, and those newly coyned, old ones
are scorned as obsolete, and the forge of our
braines is still on worke for new ones, such as will
make the eares of euery honest Christian man to
tingle and shake, if it were possible, the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Heauen and Earth.</p>
            <p>So likewise our prophane violation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth;
I will not strictly vrge a ceremoniall absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from all moderate and lawfull recreations
at seasonable houres, but I onely could wish this

euery man is busie in his vocation, buying or

and the Diuine lawes command sanctity, men
take more liberty to doe euill, being longer and
with farre greater content in the Tauerne, and
sometime in worse houses then the Temple of
God.</p>
            <p>Thus we multiply our <hi>Transgressions</hi> as the

hayres of our heads, and there is no end of our
Rebellions <hi>the euening</hi> of our carelesnesse, and <hi>the

            <p>And if we thus deale with our God, how doe

my selfe, onely thus much, it is in the most mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
in all fearefull and vncomfortable, when a

shall haue none to close vp his dying eyes, nor to

naught was heard but crying and complaining in

doing the like necessary office for them.
Gods arme is not yet shortned, nor his strength
so much weakened, but that if wee still sinne, hee
will surely smite againe.</p>

alone, but by the onely blessing of the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

there must be a true sorrow attended with visible
