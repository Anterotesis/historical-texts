            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Concerning the matter of this discourse, you shall finde in the Preface: and concerning the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, there is no great matter of learning or ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inuention, onely a simple relation of a simple truth; yet somewhat there is, which may happily concerne the learned, and giue some satisfaction to an indifferent Reader, when hee vnderstands, how two of the most mightie and most warlike Princes among the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> the great <hi>Turke</hi> and the <hi>Persian,</hi> are now in armes one against the other; stirred vp thereunto by two of our Country-men, Sir <hi>Anthonie Sherley,</hi> and Master <hi>Robert Sherley</hi> his brother.</p>
            <p>A warre not onely like to be long and bloudie, but also very commodious and of great oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the Christian Commonweale: for that it doth g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For <hi>Cortug-ogli</hi> the Turkish Pirate, in his perswasiue Oration to his great Mast. <hi>Solyman, The Magnificent,</hi> to besiege <hi>Rhodes,</hi> could say vnto him, <hi>And now dread Soueraigne, if it please you to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe but to looke into the matter, you shall see that there is a diuine occasion by the procurement of our great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Mahomet, presented vnto your most sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, for that the Christians of the West are at discorde and mortall warre among themselues.</hi> And to say the truth, the discords and dissentions of Christian

Princes haue laide more Countreyes to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richment of the Great Turke, then euer his bowe or Shield could haue purchased. In the dayes of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the second, these polluted <hi>Sarazens</hi> had gleaned out of Christendome like scattered eares of corne neglected by the owners, <hi>Two hundred Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, twelue Kingdomes, and two Empires,</hi> and still as a canker running on, before the Persian tooke the field against them, they euery yeere did fret and eate into Christendome.</p>
            <p>Finally, I might haue added many worthy col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, as well out of sacred as prophane writers, that haue written of the most stately and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Empire of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> in times past, and so haue compared it, with the moderne and present estate thereof; which hath scarce a shadow of the antique Gouernment, wherewith it was then ruled and gouerned. But the matter would haue proued too long, &amp; made this volume too great: and therefore for those aduertisements, I purpose to put them forth, when God shal make me strong and able. In the meane time, whatsoeuer is here penned, I leaue it with your Worship, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching you to giue it entertainment.

The Boates are flat bottomed, because the Riuer is shallow in many places; so that when they trauell in the Moneths of Iuly, August, and September, they finde the Riuer at so low an ebbe, that they are faine to carry with them a spare Boate or two, to lighten their owne, if they should chance to fall on the shoales. Euery night after Sunne-set, they fasten these Boats to a stake, the Merchants lying aboord, and the Marriners vpon the shore, as neare as they can vnto the same. In this passage downe the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, you shall meete with diuers troupes of <hi>Arabians,</hi> who will barter their prouision of dyet (for they care not for money) as Hennes, Kids, Lambe, Butter, and sowre milke, for Glasses, Combes, Corall, Amber, Kniues, Bread and Pomegranates, Pilles, wherewith they vse to tanne their

Then would he cause him to be carried into this val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley amongst his beautifull women, and to bee cloathed in rich apparell, so that awaking out of his trance hee should finde himselfe another man, and as though hee came into a new world. Forthwith he was entertained with all kinds of pleasures, which youth and lust could desire, and this continued so long as one whole day lasted. But at night after a certaine banket, the drinke as before againe was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him to make him sleepe, his sumptuous attire pulled off, and his former garments put on, and so carried againe into the Fortresse from whence he came, a place farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to that which he had beene in the day before.</p>

            <p>About a mile distant from this Towne is the ruines of an old Castle, once esteemed to be one of the strongest Castles in the world, and was besieged by <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great a long time before hee could winne it.

with the disposition of the <hi>Taurisians,</hi> whose minds were then so alienated from the Turkish gouernour; that vpon the approach of <hi>Abas,</hi> they were all readie to forsake him.

               <p>Notwithstanding howsoeuer by the shedding of much bloud he was saluted King, vpon the death of his father, yet hath he so carried the matter, that now he is exceedingly beloued and honoured of his subiects, in so much that when they will confirme any thing by solemne oathes they will sweare by the head of <hi>Abas</hi> the king, and when they wish well to any man, they vsually say, King <hi>Abas</hi> grant thee they desire.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:8101:38"/>Sundry times Sir <hi>Anthonie</hi> had audience of the king, wherein he declared first with what perfidious dealing,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Anthony Sherleys</hi> speech vnto the King.</note> and with what greedinesse and pride the Turkish Emperours haue alwaies set vpon the Christians, and that being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of the warre with them, he would of all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood set vpon the <hi>Persians,</hi> hauing the selfe same quarrell vnto the <hi>Persians,</hi> that he hath vnto the Christians: <hi>viz.</hi> an ardent and insatiable desire of soueraignty: a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent motiue for the greedie Turke to repute euery king, the richer that he is, the more his enemie. After that he set forth to the full the prowesse of the Christians, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull preparation, that they could make both at Sea and land, perswading the king with all his power to inuade the Turke, then altogether busied in the warres of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie,</hi> and to recouer againe such parts of his kingdome as his predecessors had lost. Warres he said were more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily managed abroad then at home: that since his maiestie alone is able to withstand the Turkes whole force and power, he needed not now to doubt of the most prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous successe, the Christian Princes (by his meanes) ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with him.</p>
               <p>He told the King further, that he was much vnmindfull of his former losses and wrongs, if he thought he ioyned an assured peace, which he should finde to be nothing else but a deferring of one war vnto more cruel times: and that the Turke if he should ouerrunne <hi>Hungary,</hi> would forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with turne his victorious armes vpon him and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: the end of one warre (as he said) was but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of another; and that the Turkish Empire could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer stay in one state; and it were good that his highnesse should obserue not the Turkes words but his deeds; and how the <hi>Othoman</hi> Emperors according to the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the time, haue vsed by turnes, sometimes force, sometimes fraude, as best serued their purposes.</p>
               <p>He wished also the king, that at length this his deceit might manifest it selfe vnto the world; and though in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

times, there were sometimes wanting will, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times occasion to vnite their forces, yet now he hoped that by an imployment from his Maiestie to the Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they would combine themselues for their common good against the common enemie; and that it concerned no lesse his Highnes, then the Christians to haue the power of the great Turke abated: &amp; this taking vp of armes should be for the good of his Maiesty, howsoeuer the warre should fall out, if wel, he should then recouer what his predecessors before had lost, with much more that was the Turkes: If o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise yet by voluntarie entering into armes to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance himselfe, and to giue the Great Turke occasion to thinke that he feared him not, which was (as hee said) the onely way to preserue the common safetie.</p>
