            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>To the Chapter concerning the Articles of Faith.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have perused the Pamphlet which you sent of Naked Truth, and whereas you require me to give you my opinion of it, though I might refer you to the Printed Discourse of that worthy Person who has animadverted upon it; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this would look like an Artificial excusing of pains, and seem only more civilly to disobey, I will trouble you with the cursory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections which I made upon a hasty view of the aforesaid Book; wherein I shall chiefly aim at two things not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly designed in the Printed Answer: First, to shew that this <hi>humble Moderator</hi> (as he stiles himself) who pretends in his Title to give <hi>the true state of the Primitive Church,</hi> is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of Ecclesiastical Antiquity, and grosly mistaken in the representations he makes thereof. And then second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas he boldly avers to the Lords and Commons, to whom he has the confidence to dedicate his Libel, <hi>that there is nothing therein contained which is contrary to the known Laws of the Land</hi>; I shall evidence that several things therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained are as contrary to the known Laws as his Printing without Licence confestly was: and that the Book is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, and tending to the disturbance of the establish'd constitution of the Church and State.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65573:3"/>As to the Book considered in the gross, my first reflexion about it was, whether it could be the work of the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, several things being so well, and more so very ill said; Therefore if it hapned to have one single Author, it either seem'd the exercise of Wit of some Sceptic and Atheistical derider of Religion, who desired to make sport with holy things, and say <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra,</hi> all that occurr'd to his mind: Or else that it was wrote in the different intervals of a craz'd Enthusiast, and therefore not unseasonably introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a declaration of being the product of Fasting and Prayer, and seeking of God, venerable words which have not left off to abuse the World: Or lastly, (which seems most probable) that it was wrote by some ambitious discontented Person of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who not preferred according to his merit, or what may be greater than that, his expectation, his mind being leaven'd with spite and anger, cavils at the present Constitution of the Church; and he having in ill humour left off studying, writes out of memory imperfect shreds of Antiquity, and yet not able to cast away at once the Principles formerly imbib'd, sometimes speaks in favour to Conformity, and quarrels the disobedience of Dissenters.</p>
               <p>But to pass from Conjectures to that which is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly before us. At the first setting out our Author tells us, That the Primitive Church received <hi>the Apostles Creed, as the sum total of Faith necessary to Salvation.</hi> And then disputes, <hi>Why is it not now so</hi>? Which involving an intimation that in the Church of <hi>England</hi> it is not thought so, can only tend to sedition, being an odious suggestion<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and absolutely false: And it is known, that scarcely any thing is more particularly insisted on by our Church against the Papists than their making new Articles to the Creed. But it seems the fault will rather lie upon us, that with the Primitive Church, we think the whole Creed necessary: For we are bid remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and observe, <hi>That the Treasurer to</hi> Candace <hi>his Creed was only, I believe that Iesus Christ is the Son of God; and no more
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65573:3"/>
that this purch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>sed the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. That is, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Death of our Saviour, his Resurrection, and Ascension; at least, those of the Catholick Church, the Communion of Saints, the Forgiveness of Sins, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Body, are if not superfluous, yet unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary speculations. How well this sutes with the close of the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed, our Author would do well to consider: If it shocks it, then he must confess that he has said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to the known Laws of the Land: The Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy (of which that makes a part) being confirmed by several Acts of Parliament, and in particular the late one of Uniformity. Moreover, the Statute of <hi>Primo Eliz.</hi> which established the Oath of Supremacy, determining the limits of Heresie to be, not only what has been ordered or judged to be so, by the Authority of the Canonical Scriptures, but also by the first four General Councils, or any of them; he may bethink himself, whether the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem of what is to be held <hi>de fide,</hi> by the Law of the Land, is so narrow as is here pretended. But our Author says, <hi>Philip required no more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>of the Eunuch than this short Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that I believe that Iesus Christ is the Son of God, and that there is no assurance nor great probability that he was more fully instructed</hi>; which is plainly to contradict the Text of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> who tells us, that <hi>Philip</hi> (from the place of <hi>Isaiah</hi> which the Eunuch was reading) began at the same Scripture, and preached unto him Jesus; which certainly expresses a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compass of particularities than is in the short System here proposed. Yet farther, it would be considered whether our Authors Argument be good; <hi>Philip required no more, but bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized him on this; and had the Eunuch departed this life in the same instant that</hi> Philip <hi>parted from him, I believe I have better assurance that thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap> Faith would have saved the Eunuch, than any man hath that he was ever taught more</hi>; therefore that Confession here required, is a sufficient Summary of Faith. For sure there is more required as necessary to be known of a Man, than of a Child in Christ. Such a knowledge as perswades to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65573:4"/>
the undertaking the Covenant and duties of the Gospel, may entitle unto Baptism; but yet neither involves the knowledge of the whole Gospel, nor supersedes the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. As to the Event of the Eunuchs condition had he departed this life immediately after Baptism, it is as much to the purpose as if one should say, that if an Infant immediately after Baptism should depart this life, he would be saved even without the Eunuchs Creed, therefore even that may well be spared. But after a complaint of the <hi>mischiefs arising from the establishment of new and many Articles of Faith, and requiring all to assent unto them</hi>: (which let them who are guilty of doing answer for it) the Author goes on to say, That <hi>for his part he thinks nothing can be more clearly deduced from Scripture, nothing more fully expressed in Scripture, nothing more sutable to natural Reason, than that no man should be forced to believe.</hi> Whereby he means, or else he can mean nothing, (for what appears not is as if it were not) that no man should be forced to declare his belief of any thing. Now since the Scripture under the severest penalties requires the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ before men, it is not sure contrary to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that Persons should be forced to declare their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and if so, will not be thought unsutable to natural Reason neither. But now let us see whether this Assertion of our Author be not <hi>contrary to the Law of the Land,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the assurance we have from him who tells us, <hi>there is not a word in his discourse against it.</hi> The Oath of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, enjoyned by the Statute before mentioned, <hi>Primo Eliz.</hi> commands the Subject <q>to testifie and declare in his conscience, that the Kings Majesty is the only Supreme Governour of this Realm, and of all other his Highness Dominions and Countries, as well in all Spiritual or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical things or causes, as Temporal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> So likewise the other <hi>Tertio Iacob.</hi> 
                  <q>I truly and sincerely acknowledge, profess, testifie, and declare in my conscience before God and the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And the Act of Uniformity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <q>the Abjuring of the Covenant, and assenting and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65573:4"/>
consenting to every thing contained in the Liturgy.</q> And after this, let my Author consider with what duty and good manners he concludes, <hi>Thus you see how impertinent, how irrational, how impious it is to require a man to believe</hi> (that is, profess his belief of) <hi>any thing more than is clearly contained in Scripture.</hi> The truth is, we, dull as we are, do not at all see this impertinence and unreasonableness, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beautiful illustrations of the <hi>Eye and the Candle, the hammer and the beating out the brains.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught us that Heresie is a work of the flesh, and we know Pride, and Prepossession, and Interest are of more concernment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in than want of faculties and apprehension. The thing complained of is, that men turn away their faces, shut their eyes, and will not lay their heads to consider what is set before them: And if the immorality of error be once cured, there will be a speedy account of its misadventures in Speculation and Theory. The Will of man has an higher pretence to freedom than the Intellect; Tyranny can make me suffer, but cannot oblige me to approve, much less to chuse: and yet it is not impertinent or irrational to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire men to will, and, what is more than that, actually to perform their duty: Nor can any sufficient cause be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, why perverse and stubborn men should not be made to learn it and consider it too; which plainly is their duty, and previous to the performance of it. The Scripture indeed commands to speak the truth in love, to instruct the Brother in the spirit of meekness; and the same Scripture has made the greatest Christian Monarch, and his meanest Vassal brethren; but notwithstanding that, he bears not the Sword in vain; and in love and meekness, and with the greatest kindness and charity, is obliged to cut off the evil doer. The question, <hi>To what purpose is force</hi>? would indeed do well in the mouth of a Ranter or Anabaptist, and I might answer thereto, that it is ordained by God to punish the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of such a question by sharp severities; but I shall content my self to repeat the Apostles words, just now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65573:5"/>
recited, <hi>The Magistrate bears not the Sword in vain</hi>; there is a purpose why fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ce should be used, and all sober men understand it, though our Author knows not of it. What is added of the <hi>Scripture rule of Faith being compleat and full</hi> is seriously to be considered: But he who straitens the <hi>credenda</hi> into one short Proposition of the Eunuchs Creed, may in likelihood be as blameable in diminishing from it, as any can be by adding to it. Though, by the way, our Author is to know, that the explication of Faith, is not the extending or making new Articles of it. And what he says of <hi>requiring men to believe with Divine Faith what they add to the Scripture, is to make their words equal with God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â¢</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>: If this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> first he proceeds on a false sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, that there is somewhat added, when there is not any thing added; And secondly, it is notorious, they have never pretended that any thing ought to be believed, <hi>as Scripture, or with Divine Faith,</hi> but Scripture. So that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerations of <hi>impertinent, irrational, and impious,</hi> fall to the ground, unless they may chance to rest upon the head of him who to seditious and uncharitable purposes produces them.</p>
               <p>The next Paragraph desires it may be soberly considered, that <hi>the Trinity, Incarnation, Resurrection are things far above the highest reason, yet believed, because God, who cannot lie, hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them: And that it is strange that any one should take upon him to declare one tittle of them more than God hath declared.</hi> But I desire to be allowed to put in a caveat, that men should not be suffered to declare several (not tittles, but) Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, less than God hath declared; that our Authors di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection concerning the <hi>quashing the whole debate of the Omoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now we know perfectly the true cause of all the Heresies that ever came into the Church. I will adventure not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this to add one more to the number, and say, in opposition to what is here averred, that Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty received more advantage from Philosophy than ever it did damage from it. It is true, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, that the Philosophers were the Patriarchs of Hereticks, but it is as true, they were the Champions of Christian truth. He must be a stranger to every thing that relates to the Church, who know not how much Religion ows to <hi>Iustin Mart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and (notwithstanding all his misadventures) to <hi>Origen</hi> himself. The last and most dangerous attempt against Christianity was the setting up Heathen Morality, gilded over with Magick against Christian Ethicks; labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus, Porphyry, Iamlichus, Plotinus, Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Simplicius,</hi> and several others: And had not the good providence of God raised up the before mentioned, and other eminent Christian Philosophers, to attaque them in their strengths, and fight them with their own Weapons; it is to be feared our holy Faith would not have had so easie, or so clear a victory over the World. But because our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has so particular a Pique against Sophistry, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire him at his leisure to read the twenty ninth Chapter of the seventh Book of <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s Ecclesiastical History, the Title of which Chapter is, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>But the stop put to the Donatists Schism, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Civil Magistrate is a great mote in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors eye, and one way or other he will be sure to remove it. First, he tells us, <hi>It is well known the Donatists were a Sect very turbulent in behaviour.</hi> Alas, our Author has a Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors memory, and has quite forgot the unpeaceable temper of our Dissenters, and how naturally Conventicles mustered themselves into Armies: But which way the <hi>enforcing a Confession of Faith</hi> comes to <hi>be our case,</hi> he will do well to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret himself. If he speaks against the Penal Laws; and the tendering of the Oath of Supremacy to Recusants thereby directed, be the enforcing a Confession of Faith which he speaks against; there is again somewhat contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his Book which is contrary to the known Laws of the Land. Fearing the success of this answer, he offers
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65573:9"/>
another, which is, that <hi>for ought any body knows these seeming converted Donatists were only Hypocrites, who for the love of the World, more than for the love of the truth, forsook their Heretical Profession; or if their hearts were really changed as to belief, it is evident they were worldly still, and not one step nearer heaven.</hi> First, if <hi>for ought any body knows these Donatists were only Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,</hi> for ought any body knows they were sincere; and Charity obliges to the better side. As to the <hi>carnality of their hearts,</hi> it is Gods, and not our Authors, Prerogative to judge of them; In the mean time, it is surely of some good effect, to have set the understanding right, though a thorough reformation be not made on the aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>ctions. The ill luck is, the reasoning of our Author herein, if it prove any thing, is as valid against the Secular M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gistrates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining Immorality and Vice, as well as Error. For men may be Hypocrites, and carnal in their hearts; may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and wish Murder, Fraud, and Theft, though for fear they dare not act them. Our Author has more solutions in his Budget, and is very liberal of them, for he goes on, and says, <hi>That though we farther grant the pruning of the Magistrates Sword did really correct the viciousness of the Tree, yet we must not dÃ² evil that good may come of it.</hi> That is, to punish Hereticks is in its self, and in its nature evil. This, I confess, comes home to the point, and would have superseded the former: But the proof is wanting, and must ever be; for the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is false, as we have shewed above: And is contrary not only to all the Imperial Laws, made against Hereticks, as also the Ecclesiastical of this National Church; but the Municipal, against which our Author gave the Parliament his engagement that he had not spoken a word. But the illustration of this his Position is wonderfully pleasant, I mean the instance of <hi>Peter</hi>'s cutting <hi>off Malchus his ear, for which he is sharply reproved, and threatned with perishing by the Sword,</hi> &amp;c. As if because St. <hi>Peter,</hi> a private man, might not use the Sword against the Magistrate, the Magistrate might not neither against a private man. But lastly, if none of all the answers will conclude, there is one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve

               <p>Our good man recapitulates the whole matter, and would have us not mistake him. <hi>All this he says in reference to compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling men to believe or conform, reserving to the Magistrate power to punish evil Doers, not evil Believers.</hi> I pray Sir remember once more your promise to the Parliament; whatever shift you will make to palliate the matter concerning there not being Laws to compel men to believe, I am sure there are Laws enough which would fain by Penalties compel men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and here you tell us, that all this long discourse is levelled against them. What pity it is that great Wits, and men who speak untruth, have not better memories? Whatever punishment they are worthy of who disobey the Laws; they deserve much greater who stand in defiance, and dispute against them; but what shall we say of him who at once denies and boasts his guilt, robs in the midst of an Assize, and while he does so, cries out unto the Judge, and desires him to take notice that he does no harm?</p>

Not long since our Neighbours of <hi>Holland</hi> refused to strike Sail to his Majesties Flag, upon which a bloudy War ensued. Shall we borrow now our Authors Rhetorical Apostrophe, and cry out, <hi>My Fathers, My Fathers,</hi> so much Christian bloud spilt, so many Orphans, so many Widows made, so much Treasure spent, and all for a Ceremony? I pray mount a Turnip Cart, and preach to the heathen world the Spirit of the Hat, and hold forth that striking Sail is the same Idolatry in a Ship, as the putting off a Hat is in a Brother. Certainly, there is some dismal mischief in these Ceremonies of the Church, else there would never have been such a loud outcry of <hi>O my Fathers, my Fathers, will you restrain the Liberty of the Gospel to the rigidity of your Discipline, to lose some, to lose many, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance in the end to lose all, your selves and all?

Which is plainly to say, That to gratifie Dissenters we ought to discard all Ceremonies, and in contradiction to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who enjoyns that all things should be done decently and in order, nothing is to be done decently and in order. I must have leave to say, That in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance Raiment is the Body, Ceremony is substance. I may put off a Sca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A Ceremony, considered <hi>in individuo,</hi> or retail, may be of no great moment; but they, taken <hi>in genere,</hi> and in the bulk, are absolutely necessary. The following Objection, that <hi>by parting with Ceremonies,</hi> which tend to the encreasing Devotion, preserving Order, and giving glory to Almighty God, we shall <hi>displease our Friends, and then lie exposed to our Enemies to spoil our goods,</hi> is of more moment than to be thrown off by saying, that our <hi>goods are only Faith, Hope, and Charity, and that these stood firm in the Primitive times, when there was not one of our Ceremonies to preserve it.</hi> Surely, the scandalizing those who do their duty, by our breaking the Laws, is a greater mischief, than to displease those who violate their duty, by our keeping the Law. A Scandal only taken is of less moment, than one both taken and given. And if <hi>Faith and Hope</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be unconcerned in this whole matter, yet Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is sure the natural product of Decency and Order; and the common rule, that it ought to begin at home, is here to take place, and their satisfaction be most studied who are of the Houshold of Faith, rather than the humour and caprice of the Desertors of it, Moreover, upon a true account it is not Charity to Dissenters to humour them in their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience towards their spiritual Superiours; no more than it is, to give Impunity to that of Rebels, against their temporal.

               <p>THe Chapter concerning Preaching is a most unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable reproach of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> After that the Uniform Vote of all our Neighbours has given us the preference in this particular, the Ministers of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, <hi>Germans, Hollanders, Danes, Swedes, French,</hi> and <hi>Switzers,</hi> learning our Language generally to take be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of our Sermons, and many travelling hither for that end; our Author, led to it by his excellent good nature, labours to shew his Talent in depreciating what strangers so must esteem. There was a time when Nicity of Division, and the flowers of a <hi>Polyanthea</hi> were somewhat in fashion; but those days are long since done, a practical sober way of pressing Christian duty is generally taken up, which has as little of the <hi>Quid, or the Quale, or the Quantum,</hi> as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor seems to have in his head; or has discovered in his Writings. His project for <hi>Preachers</hi> is as extravagant as his Character of our Sermons.

These would <hi>redeem the Church from that great contempt, the Aristotelists, Scotists, Aquinatists, with their<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> knacks of quiddities, and qualities, Syllogisms, and Enthymems, Distinctions, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumtions, and the handsome School-boy exercise of the very good Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers</hi> of the Age, have brought upon it.</p>

And we may say it with perfect truth, and therefore without vanity, that they have also the most learned and sufficient Clergy: Men that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed much better than our Author, who in his first Chapter has done what his little knowledge, and violent passion could effect, toward the undermining of it. The truth is, I cannot but wonder how it is possible for a man, that did not design to put scorn upon Religion, to offer such mad and unaccountable Proposals, and the while talk demurely, and in Scripture Phrase, as if he would be thought to be in earnest.</p>

belong only to an irrational animal, as that of a man to a rational; for our Author has precluded himself from that answer, by saying expresly that <hi>a man, a rational Creature, contains the animality of a Horse, the inferiour or irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> And now if my Author be not a mere animal, let the World judge: and this comes of despising Logick. Let us now see whether his Divinity be better than his Philosophy. After this hog-shearing, where we have had so loud a cry and no wool, we will if we can pick out a little sense; The thing he aims at proving is, that Bishops are not superiour in <hi>Order</hi> to Priests; a thing, by the way, directly contrary to the Liturgy of the Church, and thereby the Law of the Land: but yet they are superiour in <hi>Commission,</hi> and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that can govern, exercise the power of the Keys, and ordain Priests and Deacons, which Priests, ordinarily speaking, may not. Well, if this Commission were from Heaven, and stand upon that Scripture Basis, of <hi>As my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sent me, so send I you,</hi> by vertue whereof the Bishops, during the first ten Persecutions, governed their Flocks in despight of all Secular opposition, and retaining part of their administration to themselves, disposed of some to Priests and Deacons; which is as notorious in fact, as any thing in the world: The Bishops may do tolerably well, with this new word <hi>Commission,</hi> instead of the old of <hi>Order.</hi> Especially, since in the close it is confest by our Author: that <hi>in this order the Apostles left the Church at their death, and in this order their Successors continued it (as in duty sure they ought) from time to time near</hi> 1500 <hi>years without any interruption where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for any to alter this way of Government, or to take upon them to ordain, not being chosen this way to it, they would be guilty of great rashness and high presumption.</hi> Nor will it be in my Authors power to kick all this down again, as he endeavours in the following period, by making the orders given by Priests though irregular, yet firm and valid; for if this power be from Heaven, and separate from all Secular Authority, as to its Nature and Original; though limited by it in its Exercise and Application: no man upon any pretence can
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65573:14"/>
take this honour to himself or confer it on others, but they who were called of God as was <hi>Aaron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us see how well our Author confutes the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Order between Bishops and Priests? <hi>Tis ridiculous,</hi> says he, <hi>that the Priesthood which is capable to do the greatest things, to Consecrate the Souls of men by Baptism and the Lords Supper, yet forsooth cannot Consecrate Oil and Cups</hi>? I desire to know whether a Deacon cannot Consecrate the Souls of men by Baptism and the Preaching of the Gospel, or if they can, whether they are of the same Order with Priests? Or whether a Judg who has power of Awarding Life or Death which is the greatest thing, may also make a Knight which is a less, and if therefore a Judg and a King be of the same Order? This word ridiculous is very unlucky, and commonly returns on him who is most busie with it; But since we are faln upon the instance of a King, for farther illustration of this matter let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Monarchs of the <hi>East,</hi> who permitted the whole Administration of their Affairs to their Favorites, as we read of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that he pulled his Ring off his hand and said to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> without thee no man shall lift up his hand or foot in all the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and according to thy word shall all my People be Ruled; but for all this <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and this his Minister of State were not of the same Order; for in the Throne he was greater then he. Though the King had stript himself of the whole Execution of his Power, and put it into the hand of his Favorite, yet so long as the Origination of it continued with him, he was as absolute, and the other as subject as ever. Tis true the Bishops power is in itself Subordinate and Ministerial; he must not Lord it over the Inheritance of God, but as to the dispensing of it to the inferior Orders, the Parallel will hold; they all Act in Subordination and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon him. <gap reason="foreign">

But a farther Argument is taken from the <hi>promiscuous use of the name of Bishop and Presbyter,</hi> to prove they are of the same Order, which sure is one of seeblest ways of proving any thing; the whole force of it amounts to this, St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> call themselves Presbyters, but were also Bishops; therefore Presbyters and Bishops are all one: which is as much as to say, that his Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Since our Authors Greek reading fares no better, let us go on to consider his Latine; and there is no missing St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roms</hi> Epistle to <hi>Evagrius,</hi> which is so clear in the point, that without more ado it converted our Author, who it seems was once an Episcopal man, into that errant Presbyterian that now he is. Withal it makes him wonder, and if the Reader <hi>understand Latine, he will wonder to see men have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to quote any thing out of it for the distinction between Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy and Presbytery.</hi> Well, I have read over the Epistle, and, as our Author says, wonder, but it is at his great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to say, that there is nothing to be met with in it, to found a distinction between Episcopacy and Presbytery, when as he expresly reserves the power of Ordination pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly to the Bishops, which is the point chiefly contested between the Assertors of Episcopacy, and Patrons of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian parity. As to the second desire, that <hi>the Reader should observe the various fate of St.</hi> Jerom <hi>and</hi> Aerius, <hi>that the one is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled as an Heretick, the other passes for a Saint</hi>: I will satisfie my Author in that particular, and shew him a plain reason for it. <hi>Aerius</hi> set himself against the Apostolical Government by Bishops, dogmatized, and separated himself from the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65573:16"/>
Church: St. <hi>Ierom</hi> always obeyed his Governours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Communion with them, upon other occasions exprest his opinion in behalf of their Authority: And here only in a private Epistle to a Friend, and that a very short one, being scandalized at an unseasonable opinion, which pretended Deacons to be equal in dignity to Priests; as it is usual in such cases, he depresses what he can the Order of Deacons, and exalts to his utmost that of Priests, in the mean time does not so much as attempt to prove any thing more than barely saying, <hi>Quid aliud facit Episcopus excepta Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatione quod non facit Presbyter</hi>? <q>What does a Bishop more than a Presbyter besides Ordaining?</q> And then reckoning up several actions common to both. Our kind-hearted Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hereupon tells us, that this presently converted him; nay, as if this good nature of his were as meritorious as grace, he thereupon assures himself, <hi>that great is his reward in heaven.</hi> Our man of learning with his accustomed dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity and confidence runs down the business of <hi>Colluthus</hi> his Ordination of Priests, and pities <hi>poor Bishop</hi> Hall <hi>for going about to prove from thence, that Presbyters were not capable to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</hi> How slightly soever our Author thinks of the matter, <hi>Socrates</hi> in the first Book of his History puts it under the blackest Character. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap>. <q>He privately adventured on an action worthy of many deaths, who, having never been ordained a Priest, did those things which belonged to the Function of a Priest.</q> This you are to know was said of <hi>Ischryas</hi> who had as good Orders as <hi>Colluthus</hi> a Priest could give him, but yet antecedently to the Decree of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> is declared never to have been ordained a Priest. Let up now see why the old man was so much to be pitied, <hi>because he had quite forgot that the famous Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>consisting of above three hundred Bishops, had made a Canon, wherein they declare, that if any Bishop should Ordain any of the Clergy belonging to another Bishops Diocess, without consent and leave had of that Bishop to whose Diocess they did belong, their Ordination
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65573:16"/>
should be null. You see the irregular Ordination of a Bishop is as null as the irregular Ordination of a Presbyter: Therefore the irregular Bishop, and the irregular Presbyter are of the same Order, of the same Authority; neither able to Ordain.</hi> Our Author, according to his usual Sagacity, knows no difference betwixt an Act that is null and void in it self, and an Act voided by Law. There is no question but Bishops, and Priests, and Deacons for their Crimes may be degraded and deposed, but that is not the same thing with the never having been Bishops, Priests, or Deacons. The Council of <hi>Alexandria</hi> declared the Ordinations of <hi>Colluthus</hi> to have been void <hi>ab initio,</hi> that of <hi>Nice</hi> voids those that are irregular. Surely these are very different matters. That the invalidity of the Ordination in the later case was of this kind, that is, made invalid by way of Penalty and Sentence, we may learn from the thirty fifth Apostolick Canon; by which both <hi>Zonaras</hi> and <hi>Balsamon</hi> interpret this of <hi>Nice</hi>; who decree that in case of ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in anothers Diocess the Bishop <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                  </gap>, <q>Both he be deposed and they who were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by him.</q> And truly if they were to be deposed, it is plain the Orders were in themselves valid; and it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable that the Ordaining Bishops were so: which is not to be said, and can never be proved of a mere Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And therefore the Triumph which is added here of <hi>dashing out the indelible Character, or that the Line of a Diocess is a Conjurers Circle,</hi> might very fairly have been laid aside. And I appeal to the Reader, and more than <hi>hope he will see how no proofs are brought for this Identity</hi> and parity <hi>of Order; no Scripture, no Primitive Council, no general consent of Primitive Doctors and Fathers</hi>; that he is perfectly out in every thing he avers, and therefore for his <hi>poor judgment</hi> he may do well to keep it to himself, and probably his Judgment is so poor because he himself is rich. He in likelihood has imployed his time in Secular Concerns, which had it been spent in Study, would have rescued him from such gross misadven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as he at every turn incurrs.</p>

It is, it seems, a Scheme of speech which our Author never met with, to say of things or persons you are not this or this, but that; when they are remarkably more that, than this or this. Thus God says to <hi>Samuel</hi> of the People, who, complaining of his Old Age, and evil Sons, desired a King: that they had not rejected <hi>Samuel,</hi> but God. All men of common sense know very well the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be, that though they rejected the Prophet, that was not to come into account with the Rebellion and Insolence wherein they rejected the Lord himself. Though God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Sacrifices under the Law, he expresly says, he will have no Sacrifice, and delights not in, nay, abhors Burnt Offerings; yet this did not abrogate the Divine Institution, nor make Almighty God contradict himself. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises <hi>Philemon</hi> to receive <hi>Onesimus</hi> his servant, not now as a servant, but above a servant, a Brother beloved: By which words it is not to be inferred, that he should presently manumit him, but use him with kindness. But vanity and ignorance are most incommodiously quartered together; our Author had a mind to shew his reading, and pick a quarrel with the Translator of a Father: And then, no doubt, he

               <p>OUr Author has a dexterity of talking extravagantly of several weighty subjects, and this he calls <hi>handling</hi> them: which being beyond his strength, he heaves them to as much purpose as if they were Timber; and thinks he has acquitted himself to admiration. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>handled</hi> the former points; that is, talkt beyond all aim and measure Foolishly; Now he says he comes <hi>to the Authority of Bishops to Govern as well as to Ordain.</hi> And truly if they are to do one, as they are on his principle, to do the other, their Authority is likely to signifie but little; being shared by every the meanest Priest. But the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry is, that <hi>the Power of the Keys is left to Chancellors, Lay-men who have no more capacity to Sentence or Absolve a sinner, then to dissolve the Heaven and the Earth, and make a new Heaven and an Earth.</hi> And thus the good man runs on like an Horse with an empty Cart, exceedingly pleased with the ratling of the Wheels, and gingling of the Bells; but he never considers that all the proceedings of Chancellors in the Bishops Court are in consequence of the Canons of the Church which are the Decrees of Bishops Authoritatively met together, which have defined such and such Doctrines Heretical, such and such actions punishable with Suspension, Sequestration or Deprivation, and the like: Now all that the Chancellor has to do, is to examine the matter of Fact, take the allegations and proofs, and apply the Sanction of the Law to them. But where that extends to the use of the Keys, that is reserved to them who by Christs Institution are trusted therewith. And if Dr. <hi>Duck</hi> did do an ill thing, the fault lies at his door; and tis well if in this profligate age a single instance can only be pitcht upon. We have, blessed be God, a great happiness in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of our Municipal Laws, none in the World being a firmer Bulwark of the Princes Rights and Peoples Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; but should every clamorous Person be hearkned

               <head>To the Chapter of Confirmation.</head>
               <p>THis Chapter begins with a liberal Confession, <hi>that Confirmation or some such thing is necessary</hi>: but tis a little odd that in a matter which approaches to the being necessary, a loose <hi>succedaneum</hi> of some such thing, should be sufficient. Our Author like a true Empiric, in all cases strives to bring in <hi>aliquid Nostri,</hi> his preparation of the Medicin will render it Soveraign: but the old, known, and received Forms must by no means be taken. Having then made up a narrative of matter of Fact, jumbling, as his way is, true and false together, his first objection against Confirmation as it now stands is. <hi>That it is not possible for a Bishop of so large a Diocess as some of ours are, some extended Three or Fourscore Miles, many Forty or Fifty, Personally to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm half the Youth in a Diocess, if he duly examine each one as is fit and necessary. We see how this is performed in their Triennial Visitations.</hi> Having put in a Caveat in behalf of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Constitution, and minded my Author again of his promise to the Lords and Commons, that there was not a word in his Book against the known Laws; I cannot but reflect, that surely he lives in a Country where the Bishop is not over-diligent in his duty, else he would never make the task to be so impossible, unless the Bishop never comes into his Diocess, or never stir any where abroad in it: surely a very little contrivance with the diligence of the Ministers would make it possible both for the Bishop and Youth to meet together without much trouble to either. There is no doubt if the affair be adjourned over to the Triennial Visitation, 'tis not likely to be well done: but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65573:21"/>
as this ought not to be the course; so thanks be to God it is not. The next inconvenience in the present Constitution is the disability of the Curat to fit for Confirmation; and the little credit to be given, <hi>when he assures the Bishop when he presents the Children, that they are fully instructed for it</hi>: and therefore he concludes it necessary, <hi>to appoint some discreet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious Ministers in the several Circuits to examine and Licence for the Lords Table</hi>: for he passes it for granted, <hi>that Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no Sacrament, and if it were, why may not Priests, not Bishops perform it?</hi> Well but suppose these discreet consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious Ministers, that are to supply the place of the Parochial ones, should not be better qualified, be more discreet or conscientious then them, as it may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably happen; tis plain they cannot have those opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities either to instruct the Youth of each Parish, or know they are instructed, as the local Minister is furnisht with; but then farther is it likely that the several Parochial Ministers will readily admit their neighbour Minister, whom they may reasonably think not much wiser or better then themselves to meddle in their Cures, or that the people will be contented with it? Will not animosities and quarrels, and contempt of the duty certainly follow? As to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of Priests and not Bishops performing it, upon the supposal that Priests and Bishops are the same thing, and that Priests may Ordain, which is the Doctrine taught in one of the preceding Chapters, this of Priests <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore notwithstanding our Authors project, Bishops may do well to go on in the Execution of their Duty in this most Ancient and Useful Right, in which from the first Planting of the Gospel to this moment, they have been in possession. They who of late invaded the power of Ordaining Priests, having been so modest yet, as not to usurp this part of the Episcopal Office.</p>

Is there no manner of need why the Prince should know the names of the Aldermen in his Metropolis, much less of the people in his Dominions? and is it so impossible a thing to comprehend all the necessary interests of an Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Diocess? The truth is, our Author would make every Parish-Priest a Bishop, and then the Diocess will be little enough; and the Revenues of the Bishops will be needless things, and as he says, <hi>the greedy Harpyes will readily make use of his zealous intentions:</hi> but I pray let us make a parallel to his Ecclesiastial Policy in the Civil State. There are a certain sort of men made <hi>Iudges</hi> in the several Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits of <hi>England,</hi> which Circuits are <hi>many of them Fifty, Six<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they may as well have a part of</hi> France <hi>in their Circuit</hi>: Were it not therefore better that every Lord of the Leet should distribute Justice in the Precincts of his Mannor; that no man should be at the expence of seeing Councel, taking out Writs, or of going to the Shire-Town, or vamping upon the Hoof with shooes at back to <hi>Westminster-Hall</hi>; but the Steward of the Court who knows the name and face and concern of every one should dispatch all things, and doubtless this would make a happy World. The Parish would quickly find the advantage of this new Scheme; to have their Estates, their Lives and Fortunes in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus mad is the Ecclesiastical Policy of our Divinity-Common-Wealths-man, tis no very good account of time to write an <hi>Vtopia,</hi> a Politick Romance; but to play tricks in Holy things, and set on foot a Christian <hi>Oceana,</hi> is an unpardonable fault. But our Author proceeds to <hi>consider a second abuse in Church Government, which is exempt Iurisdictions.</hi> Whatever a man thought of the unexpedience of any thing Establisht by Law, surely in good manners he should not give it ill Language, and call it an abuse, while it stood so Authorized and supported. Which should be done especially by him who has past a solemn promise of not speaking a word against the known Laws of the Land. But of all men in the World our Author, whose business it is to make all the Parishes in <hi>England</hi> peculiars, and have them straitned to the narrow limits, which admit the <hi>knowing every name and face,</hi> should not speak against exempt Jurisdictions; for if the whole Nation were so Cantoned out, and we had ten thousand Bishops in <hi>England,</hi> we had exactly the Scheme which he recommends, and at the same time complains of.

It will not be enough to say, that the Book has every where in it sober and honest truths; for so has the <hi>Cracovian Catechism,</hi> and the <hi>Alcoran</hi>; nay, there is scarce any Conjuring Book which does not for the greatest part consist of devout and godly Prayers, We are told by our Author, <hi>That it is above two years since he had these thoughts, in which time he has read and conferr'd all he could to discover if he were in an Error; but, for all he could yet meet wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

time should never be once awake, converse with any good Book, or man of Sense; or have the least reflexion upon what is either truth or expedience. I never read this Book entirely over more than once; nor have I had much leisure to consider it: And yet I presume any indifferent Reader will see what gross misadventures have been detected by me, and probably himself will discover many more: For, in earnest, there are every where such blots that one can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoid the hitting; such flaws in Discourse, that there needs no picking of holes, or looking narrowly to find the Incoherence, but the passage lies wide open, and one may fairly drive a Cart and Horses thorow. Upon the whole matter I cannot but conclude, that Pride or Discontent, or some other very prevalent Passion has here interposed: For what else should make a man think himself fit to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse the established Constitution of the Church, and give his advice to the Parliament, how they should evacuate all their Laws? What should make him almost in every Period contradict himself; pretend to the knowledge of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Religion, rant against Universities, disparage the Ministers and Preaching of the Nation: and at the same time discover the grossest ignorance and inconsideration as is imaginable? And amidst all this acknowledge obligations to Submission and Conformity, and whatever he has spoke against: And after two years deliberation not to see that which is evident at the first glance, to any one that has but half an eye?

Let my Author seriously consider where this Fundamental mischief lies; search his own heart, and desire the Searcher of hearts to discover it to him.
