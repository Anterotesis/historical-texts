         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>UPon the firſt View of the Title
of this Treatiſe, I doubt not
but many Perſons will ſlight
it, being upon a <hi>Topick</hi> well known
and underſtood (as they imagine)
by even every Pretender to the Law:
There's not the leaſt Sollicitor or
Attorney in any Nook of <hi>Cornwall,</hi>
or Corner of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> but
thinks he is privy to the whole Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Ejectments.</hi> And yet if
they would take the Pains to peruſe
<pb facs="tcp:56917:3"/>
the enſuing Sheets, they doubtleſs
may be of another Opinion, and will
find very uſeful and proper Matter
relating to an Action which concerns
the greateſt Titles in the Kingdom,
and has made ſo great a Noiſe at the
Barr, and in the Circuits for Sixty
Years laſt paſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if there happen any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
Miſtake in this Action, the
Remedy is very chargeable. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
Mr. <hi>Levett</hi>'s Caſe of the
<hi>Inner-Temple</hi> (the Argument
whereof made by a very Ingenious
Profeſſor of the Law, I have herein
inſerted.) The Record was an Iſſue
of <hi>Trinity Term</hi> 1696. and the
Demiſe is laid the 10th of <hi>April</hi>
1697. <hi>Habendum</hi> from the 25th
day of <hi>March</hi> then laſt paſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Demiſe ſhould have been laid
the 10th of <hi>April</hi> 1696. And tho'
Mr. <hi>LeveTt</hi> had a Verdict; yet he
could not have Judgment, but was
<pb facs="tcp:56917:3"/>
forced to a new Trial at Bar. And
many more ſuch Inſtances might be
given.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not dare to deliver my
Opinion concerning the Change of
Real Actions into <hi>Ejectione Firme,</hi>
but I know many Grave Lawyers
have grumbled at the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of a Man's being too obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to be trickt out of Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>However, this we muſt all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
That ſince the ſaid Alteration,
the Common Law hath loſt a great
Part of the Beauty and Nicety of
its Pleading.</p>
            <p>I have been large under two of
the enſuing Titles; I mean that of
<hi>Evidence,</hi> and the other of <hi>Special
Verdicts;</hi> Who ſhall be allowed as
good Witneſſes, or not; and what ſhall
be lookt upon as ſufficient Evidence
both as to Matter of Record, or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>en Fait,</hi> in this Action, is of
great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe to be underſtood; and the
<pb facs="tcp:56917:4"/>
Caſes that lay diſperſt in our Books
for that purpoſe, I have reduced to
ſome Method.</p>
            <p>And as for the right and exact
drawing of Special Verdicts, we all
own it to be an undeniable Argument
of a good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in the Law,
and of very great Conſequence, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe which concern Title of
Lands and Eſtates.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Errata</hi>'s of the Printer,
the Judicious Reader will find that
they will not much interrupt the
Senſe; and as for my own I humbly
beg Pardon.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Nature of the Action of Ejectione Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
and of the Change of Real Actions into
Ejectments. Difference between an Action of
Treſpaſs and Ejectment in Five Diverſities.
Difference between Ejectione Firme and
Quare Ejecit infra Terminum; in what
Court this Action is to be brought or not, and
of Removal by Procedendo into inferior
Courts.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THIS Action of <hi>Ejectione Firme</hi>
includes in it ſelf an Action
of Treſpaſs, as appears by
the Beginning, Body and
Concluſion of the Writ; for
the Writ begins thus: <hi>Si</hi> A. <hi>fecerit te ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curum
de clamore ſuo proſequendo tunc pone,</hi> &amp;c.
and ſo begins the Writ of Treſpaſs. The
Body of the Writ of <hi>Ejectione Firme</hi> is, <hi>Quare
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56917:10"/>
unum Meſſuagium vi &amp; armis fregit &amp; intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit;</hi>
and all the Addition in the <hi>Ejectione
Firme</hi> is, <hi>Et ipſum à firmâ ſua inde ejecit,</hi> &amp;c.
The Concluſion of both is, <hi>Et alia enormia
ei intulit ad grave damnum;</hi> and the Treſpaſs
and Ejectment are ſo woven and intermixt
together, that they cannot be ſevered; and
the Entry in an <hi>Ejectione Firme</hi> is, <hi>In plito'
Tranſgreſſionis &amp; Ejectionis Firme.</hi> In 6 <hi>R.</hi> 2.
<hi>Tit. Eject' Firme</hi> a. it is called an Action of
Treſpaſs in its Nature. The Conſequence of
this is, That in this Action, Accord with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
is a good Plea. And Accord and
Satisfaction for one ſhall diſcharge all the
Treſpaſſers and Ejectors; and tho' the Term
(which is a Chattel Real) ſhall be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
as well as Damages, yet it is a good
Plea.</p>
               <p>Now tho' we find few Titles of <hi>Ejectione
Firme</hi> in our Old Books, yet it was in uſe
all along; it was uſed in <hi>Bracton</hi>'s time, and,
Term and Damages were recovered therein.

Forms and Proceedings relating thereunto,
were great Titles in the Year-Books; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
the Law is not altered in relation to them,

But there was a new way invented to
try Titles of Land in perſonal Actions,
but was not allowed, as in <hi>Jeremy</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56917:11"/>
                  <hi>Simſon</hi>'s Caſe, 16 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>B. R.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was moved for Tryal at Bar on a feigned
Action on the Caſe, upon a Wager by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
of Parties, to have the Opinion of
the Court of the Validity of a Will;
but tho' the Action was laid in <hi>Middleſex,</hi>
yet being an Innovation, and the way to
ſubvert <hi>Ejectione Firme</hi>'s, which have ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Formedons,</hi> and it ſufficiently appearing
feigned on the Record, in that the Title of
Land is hereby to be tryed in perſonal
Actions, it was totally denied; but had it
been by direction of <hi>Chancery,</hi> the Court
would do it, but would in no wiſe grant
this.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid by <hi>Elleſmere</hi> Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
that until the 14. <hi>H.</hi> 7. it was never
known that a Poſſeſſion was removed by an
Action of <hi>Ejectione Firme,</hi> and ſaid, It was
great pity it was allowed at this day for Law
in <hi>England;</hi> and therefore was of Opinion,
That an Action of Treſpaſs <hi>Quare clauſum
fregit,</hi> was much better to try the Title than
an <hi>Ejectione Firme.</hi> 1. Becauſe no Poſſeſſion
was removed by the one. 2. Becauſe a Man
may ſo plead in an Action of Treſpaſs, as
that he may make the Plaintiff diſcloſe his
Title; whereas by his <hi>Ejectione Firme</hi> it is
no more than <hi>Non culp',</hi> and then a Trial,
and ſo out of Poſſeſſion without more buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which, he ſaid, was a Pick-pocket A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<hi>Ex M. S.</hi> 3 <hi>Leon, p.</hi> 49.</p>
               <p>This Action is grounded on two Things,
(<hi>videlicet</hi>) the Leaſe and the Ejectment.</p>
               <p>It was well obſerved in <hi>Eyres</hi> and <hi>Bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>'s
Caſe, <hi>Meor Rep.</hi> 418. That <hi>Ejectione
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56917:11"/>
Firme</hi> in former times was not thought to
be an Action which concerned the Leſſor,
but only the proper Intereſt of the Leſſee;
but now of late times it is put in ure by the
Experience of the Judges and all others, that
an <hi>Ejectione Firme</hi> is the Suit of the Leſſor,
and the Leaſe made only to try his Title,
and to recover the Poſſeſſion to him, and the
Suit is proſecuted at his Charge, and his
Leſſee is but his Inſtrument to this purpoſe;
and all this to avoid the Charge and Delay
of a Real Action, and the Peril of being
barred by a ſingle Verdict. And <hi>Partridge</hi>
and <hi>Strainge</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>Plo.</hi> 78. was cited for
the purpoſe; if one being out of Poſſeſſion
above a year, makes a Leaſe for years,
this is Maintenance within the <hi>Stat.</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi>
8. and the Leſſor and the Leſſee ſhall loſe
the Value of the Land; but if ſuch a Perſon
be at this day poſſeſt of ſuch a Leaſe to try
the Title, and not by Contract, that the
Leſſee ſhall hold the Land, this is no Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
as hath been reſolved in <hi>B. C. B. R.</hi>
and <hi>Star-Chamber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the better underſtanding the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this Action, I ſhall ſhew wherein it
differs from an Action of <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> and a
<hi>Quare Ejecit infra Terminum;</hi> for tho', as
was obſerved before, it is in a ſort a Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
yet it differs from it in ſeveral
Things.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> Damages are only to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

And from hence another difference
is obſervable in reſpect of Certainty. If in

                  <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> the Plaintiff declares in one Acre,
and abutts it, and the Jury find him guilty
<hi>in dimidio Acrae praedict',</hi> or in one Foot of
it, this is good, tho' the Moiety is not bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
they have found the Treſpaſs in the
Moiety of the Acre bounded, and this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth

Diverſity it is, that if an <hi>Ejectione Firme</hi> be
brought againſt two Defendants, the one
confeſſeth the Action, and the other pleads
in Bar, Not guilty, the Plaintiff cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
his Suit as to one of the Defendants,

It has been laid down for a conſtant Rule

for years makes a Leaſe at will, and the
Tenant at will is ejected; the Queſtion was

if the Tenant for years for this Ejectment of

So if Leſſee for years be the Remainder for

Term expires, he in Remainder for years
cannot have an <hi>Ejectione Firme,</hi> becauſe he had
no actual Poſſeſſion at the time of the Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
So if a Leaſe for years be made, and
before the Leſſee enters, a Stranger enters,
he ſhall not have this Action. And upon
this Reaſon of Law it is, that by the new
Rule of Practice, the Defendant ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
Entry and Ouſter; but it has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
That if Inquiſition upon <hi>Elegit</hi> be

               <p>When the Courſe was to ſeal an Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to try a Title of Land,<note place="margin">Who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jector formerly.</note> the Ejector
in Law was any Perſon that comes upon
any part of the Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Ejectment-Leaſe,
tho' it be by chance, and with no
intent to diſturb the Leſſee of Poſſeſſion, next
after the Sealing and Delivery of the Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Leaſe;
and ſuch an Ejector was a
good Ejector, againſt whom an Action of
<hi>Ejectione Firme</hi> may be brought to try the
Title of the Land in Queſtion. But he that
was to try a Title of Land in Ejectment,
ought not to have made an Ejector of his
own, againſt whom he might bring his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
or to conſent or agree with one to
come upon the Land let in the Ejectment-Leaſe,
with an Intent to make him an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56917:26"/>
and to bring his Action againſt him;
for by that means the Tenant in Poſſeſſion
of the Land, was after put out of Poſſeſſion
by a Writ of <hi>Habere fac' poſſeſſionem,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Notice given to him or his Leſſor
of the Suit; but now the Law is otherwiſe,
and altered by the new way of Practice.<note place="margin">The new courſe in Ejectments.</note>
For now it is not uſual to ſeal any Leaſe of
Ejectment at all in this Action, but the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
that intends to try the Title, feigns a
Leaſe of Ejectment in his Declaration, and
an Ejector, and draws a Declaration againſt
his own Ejector, who ſends or delivers a
Copy thereof to the Tenant in Poſſeſſion,
giving him Notice to appear and defend
his Title, or elſe the Ejector will confeſs,
or ſuffer Judgment by Default: But if the
Tenant or the Leſſor will defend the Title,
then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is uſual for them to move the Court
that they may be made Ejector to defend
the Title (that is) the Tenant appears,
and conſents to a Rule, with the Plaintiff's
Attorney, to make himſelf Defendant in the
room of the caſual Ejector, and this the Court
will grant, if he will confeſs Leaſe, Entry
and Ouſter, and at the Trial ſtand meerly
upon the Title; but if they do not at the
Trial confeſs Leaſe, Entry and Ouſter, then
the Judgment ſhall be entred againſt the
caſual (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Plaintiff's own Ejector.</p>
               <p>

Rep.</hi> 252. That they take no Notice judicial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

But before I proceed further,<note place="margin">The old way of Sealing Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> I hope it will
not be tedious a little to ſhew how the Law
and Practice was taken when Ejectment-Leaſes
were ſealed, and Entries to be duly
made, and Warrants of Attorney made to
deliver the Leaſe upon the Land by a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
Baron and Feme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering

<hi>Kent</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
               <p>And firſt, The way to execute a Leaſe to
try a Title, the Land being in many Men's
Hands, was to enter into one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
and leave one in that place; and then
he muſt go into another, and leave one
there, and ſo of the reſt; and then after he
had made the laſt Entry there, he ſealeth
and delivereth the Leaſe; and then thoſe
Men that were left there, muſt come out of
the Land. But when a Title was to be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Ejectment, and a Leaſe to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by a Letter of Attorney, the Courſe was,
That the Leſſor do ſeal the Leaſe only, and
deliver it as an Eſcrow, and the Letter of
Attorney, and deliver the Letter of Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
but not the Leaſe; for the Attorney
muſt deliver that upon the Land. And upon
Ejectment brought of Land in Two Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as of an Houſe and Forty Acres of Land
in <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> and a ſpecial Entry in the
Land adjoyning to the Houſe (<hi>viz.</hi>) the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in of an Horſe which was drove out of
the Land by the Defendant, this was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
a good Entry for the Land in both
the Villages <hi>per totam Curiam.</hi> So of Lands

ſo ſeiſed, made a Deed of Leaſe
to the Plaintiff and a Letter of Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to deliver the Deed and the Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
The Attorney entred upon the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of one of the Men, and there deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the Deed, and after enters in the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the other, and there doth deliver
the Deed; the Queſtion was, If it were good
for the Land for which the ſecond Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was, becauſe one Deed cannot have two
Deliveries; but the Court held, it ſhall be
intended the firſt Delivery was good for
all, and it ſhall not be intended but that
the two Men had Poſſeſſion only as Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
at Will to the Corporation, and then
the Delivery of the Leaſe in one place, is
good for all; and it ſhall not be intended

<hi>B.</hi> brought Ejectment, and declares of a
Demiſe made by the Baron and Feme; and
upon evidence to the Jury, it was ruled <hi>per
Cur',</hi> That the Leaſe will not maintain the
Declaration; for a Feme covert cannot
make a Letter of Attorney to deliver a Leaſe
of her Land, but the Warrant of Attorney
is meerly void; ſo that this only is a Leaſe

of the Husband, which is not maintained by
the Declaration. But <hi>Hopkins</hi>'s Caſe in <hi>Cro.

declared of a Leaſe made by Baron and

they muſt actually ſeal the Leaſe, as at

               </argument>
               <p>THE new way of Tryals in Ejectment
by Confeſſion of Leaſe, Entry and Ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and ſtanding only upon the Title,
make ſome Perſons conceive that Caſes or
Reſolutions about Declarations in Ejectments
(whoſe Form is now generally ſetled) to
be uſeleſs and antiquated. And in truth
they are ſo in a great meaſure; and yet
notwithſtanding there are ſeveral good Rules
and Reſolutions, as well relating to matters
of Law as Practice, and Forms, even ſince
the ſaid new Method has been taken up,
both as to what things an Ejectment may
be brought, or not, and Delivery, Entry,
Variance, and Amendments of Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
as alſo how Declarations ought to be,
when Coparceners, Joyntenants, Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56917:34"/>
Baron and Feme, Tenants in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Adminiſtrators, and the like, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
And yet even thoſe former Caſes
and Reſolutions as to the Commencement
of Leaſes and Demiſes on which the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
is, and the Dates and preciſe Times
of Entry and Ouſter, deſerve well to be
conſidered; not only as ſo many curious
Points of Law therein argued, of which it's
not to be thought a general Lawyer would
be ignorant; but becauſe in Inferiour Courts
the old way of delivering Declarations, is
and muſt be uſed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore in the firſt place cite
ſome of the principal Caſes touching the
manner of declaring in former times, as to
the Dates and Commencement of Demiſes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then come to thoſe Conſiderations
and Rules which are of preſent Uſe, both
as to Delivery, Entry, Forms, and the like,
in which many Practiſers may not be well
informed, and which are founded upon late
Reſolutions. But firſt I ſhall ſhew how De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
are to be laid in reſpect of the

                  <head>Now as to Declarations in this Action, I
ſhall lay down ſome General Rules.</head>
                  <p>1. The Plaintiff muſt declare on one Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
only; and therefore in the Caſe of the
Lord <hi>Chandois</hi> and <hi>Pitts,</hi> the Count was of
three ſeveral Leaſes of the whole to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant;
the Council prayed that one <hi>B.</hi>
may be made Defendant, and that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
might elect to proceed on one only Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
which the Court granted, and ſaid, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
the Party may declare on ſeveral Leaſes,
one at, and another from ſuch a Day, yet
cannot declare on ſeveral Leſſors. And the
Court ordered the Plaintiff to elect one Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
only, <hi>Trin.</hi> 22 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>B. R.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. In <hi>Ejectione Firme</hi> of a Cloſe, the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of them and their Nature ought to be
expreſſed (<hi>viz.</hi>) Land, Meadow or Paſture.
Its a ſure Rule the Certainty of the Land
ought to be deſcribed and the Quality, 11
<hi>Rep.</hi> 55. <hi>Savill</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
                  <p>3. In <hi>Ejectione firme</hi> Surplſage in the

4. If the Entry and Ejectment be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Declaration to be before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
of the Leaſe, the Declaration is
void. <hi>Vide Poſtea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. It muſt be alledged in what Vill the
Tenements are. <hi>Vide infra.</hi>

                  <p>That we are within the Benefit of this

                  <p>The Declaration againſt the caſual Ejector

was right, that expreſſing the Demiſe to be

entred on the Roll in <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Term laſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the caſual Ejector, which is right.</p>
                  <p>As in all Actions brought by Bill, the
uſual Method of proceeding, is to file the
Bill or Declaration in the Office; and as all
Defects on the Roll are amendable by that,
ſo this being brought by Original inſtead
of Filing a Bill in the Office, an Imparlance
is entred on the Roll, and the Method of
proceeding is in the ſame manner, as in the
<hi>Common Pleas,</hi> the Iſſue is as much amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the Imparlance-Roll as it would have
been by the Bill, if the Action had been
brought by Bill.</p>
                  <p>The Objection made to this,<note place="margin">Puleſtone <hi>and</hi> Goodluck.</note> is, That
tho' Tenants in Poſſeſſion being not all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſerved in the Country, the Tenants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to appear ſo as the Plaintiff would
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56917:53"/>
conſent to try it at the Bar, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
there was a new Declaration deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which had this Miſtake, and ſeems to
inferr, that the former Declaration was
waved, and this was altogether a new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
wherein the Court was miſinform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for there was no new Declaration de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
and that which the Defendants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
was a Copy of the Iſſue only, and
proved nothing but that there was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
which appears by the Roll, and is
admitted by the Plaintiff, otherwiſe we need
not this motion.</p>
                  <p>Now, my Lord, that the Defendants Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance

and ſhall receive a Declaration, and plead
the General Iſſue, and inſiſt upon the Title
only; and that if the Plaintiff ſhall become
Nonſuit for default of the Defendants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
Leaſe, Entry and Ouſter, then that
Judgment ſhall be entred againſt the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<hi>Goodluck,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now, my Lord, I would know what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
the Defendants were to appear to;
it muſt be a Declaration againſt <hi>Goodluck;</hi>
and what Leaſe the Defendants were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs;
it muſt be the Leaſe mentioned in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56917:53"/>
the Declaration againſt <hi>Goodluck;</hi> and what
Judgment the Plaintiffs were to have, if the
Defendants did not confeſs Leaſe, Entry
and Ouſter; it muſt likewiſe be upon the
Declaration againſt <hi>Goodluck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, my Lord, if the Defendants will
ſhew a Declaration that was delivered them
againſt <hi>Goodluck,</hi> wherein there was this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake,
it would be hard upon us; but if they
cannot, then the Declaration delivered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Goodluck</hi> is right, and the demiſe they
are obliged to confeſs, is the demiſe in that
Declaration, and only miſtaken by the Clerk's
tranſcribing it.</p>
                  <p>Now, My Lord, if the Defendants have
confeſſed a good and right demiſe, and this
hath been tried, then it would be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
hardſhip in the World, if the Court
ſhould not let the Plaintiff have the Benefit
thereof; and it is plain that the Demiſe the
Defendants are by Rule to confeſs, is the
Demiſe in the Declaration againſt <hi>Goodluck.</hi>
So that, My Lord, if there were no Statute
to help it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> take it with Submiſſion, the
Court having tried the Fact, ought to make
the Record according to the Fact they have
tryed.</p>
                  <p>As to their conſenting to appear for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of the Tenants that were not duly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
on Condition the Plaintiff would try
it at Bar; My Lord, that is an Argument
againſt them, and brings us within the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Caſe betwixt <hi>Crawley</hi> and <hi>Parr,</hi>
where there was a Judgment in Ejectment
by Confeſſion, and the Demiſe laid after
the Judgment, and amended after a Writ
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56917:54"/>
of Error brought, becauſe it was a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by Warrant of Attorney; for it ſhould
not be ſuppoſed that the Defendant gave a
Warrant of Attorney to confeſs a void Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Now, My Lord, the Defendants conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to appear, ſhall never be intended to a
void Declaration, but to a good Declaration
in order to a fair Trial. And, My Lord, we
are the more intitled to the Benefit of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are Purchaſors, for we give a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
for it, <hi>viz.</hi> agreed to try it at Bar,
and they themſelves opened it ſo.</p>
                  <p>As to what was objected, That when the
Tenants have appeared to this Declaration
in Ejectment, and are made Defendants, it
is a new Action, and that the Declaration
againſt the Caſual Ejector is rejected, and
that therefore this defect cannot be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though right in the Declaration againſt
the caſual Ejector:</p>
                  <p>I give this Anſwer, that the Declaration
againſt this caſual Ejector, is not rejected,
but is by the common Rule in Ejectment
made part of the Cauſe, inſomuch that if
the Plaintiff be nonſuited he ſhall have his
Judgment upon that Declaration, and the
Return of the <hi>Poſtea</hi> is Warrant for that
Judgment; ſo that by the common Rule
in Ejectment they are ſo tied together, that
it is all but one Action, and the now De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants
are to ſtand in the caſual Ejector's
place. But, My Lord, the Words of the
Statute are not ſo ſtrict which are in any
Proceedings precedenti Now, My Lord,
the Declaration in Ejectment is a Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56917:54"/>
and it is precedent, and it is within the
equitable meaning of the Statute, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
all Amendments that are by neglect
of the Clerk if it appears that they are right
in any of the Proceedings, and for that end
a Philiſer's Note, tho' no part of the Record
hath been ſufficient to amend by.</p>
                  <p>And, My Lord, the ſame may be ſaid
when the Defendant is arreſted by a <hi>Lat. de
Placito tranſgr',</hi> and the Plaintiff declares in
Debt or Caſe, and miſtakes the Chriſtian Name
Sirname, whether ſhall it be amended by
the <hi>Lat.</hi> and whether the <hi>Lat.</hi> ſhall be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon to be a Proceeding precedent to the
Declaration, becauſe in another Action, and
ſo it would be if a Man be arreſted <hi>de Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cito
tranſgr', ac etiam Bill',</hi> and the Plaintiff
declares in Debt only, this is likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from the Writ; but theſe are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the Practice and Courſe of the
Court, theſe Proceſſes being made uſe of
only to force an Appearance; and the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
may then declare in Caſe of Treſpaſs or
Debt, as he ſees good. Now My Lord, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations
in Ejectment are the ſame thing,
becauſe only made uſe of to force an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
and are by the common Rule in
Ejectment become no more part of the ſame
Action, than a <hi>Lat.</hi> is. But this, My Lord,
we have a full Anſwer to; for the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the now Defendant, is entred
on the Roll, and is right.</p>
                  <p>But with Submiſſion, My Lord, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
is ſufficient to warrant its own
Amendment, it being by Original, <hi>viz.
Que Johan' Levett &amp; Maria eidem Rogero
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56917:55"/>
demiſer' ad terminum qui nondum praeteriit,
intraver' &amp; ipſum à firma ſua praedicta eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer'.</hi>
Now, My Lord, the Count may be
amended by the Original, which is, that
the Plaintiff's Leſſors had before that time
demiſed the Premiſſes to the Plaintiff for a
Term not then paſt; and if the Count be
made of a Demiſe then in being, it is all
the Amendment we deſire. But, My Lord,
here it may be objected, When muſt that
Demiſe bear date and commence? Muſt
the Court ſet a Date and Commencement
to Plaintiff's Demiſe?</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
is certain by the Declaration,
<hi>videlicet,</hi> from the 25th of <hi>March</hi> laſt, and
that muſt be the 25th day of <hi>March</hi> laſt
before the Term the Iſſue is entred on,
which is from 96. and then the Date of the
Demiſe muſt be betwixt <hi>Trinity</hi> Term, 96.
and the 25th of <hi>March</hi> before, which points
directly at the Miſtake which is in <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſs.</hi>
If the 10th of <hi>Aril</hi> 1697. inſtead of
1696. and where the Court can by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
take notice what was intended; it is
the ſame thing as if it had been once rightly
named before, and is within the meaning of
that Statute, which after the naming of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Miſtakes, hath theſe general words, and
all other Miſtakes of the like nature, which
My Lord, muſt be of no Signification, if this
be not the meaning of this Statute.</p>
                  <p>And, My Lord, as to this being the fault
of the Clerk, I need no Argument to prove
it, for the matter ſhews it ſelf; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
againſt the caſual Ejector being
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56917:55"/>
right, proves this the Fault of the Clerk in
tranſcribing this wrong, though the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
may properly be ſaid to be the Act of
the Client, yet that ſhall be intended the
Declaration againſt the caſual Ejector, that
being the firſt Declaration, and all that is
neceſſary for the Client to inſtruct his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
in, the reſt only depending on the
Forms and Practice of the Court, wherein
the Attorney needs no further Inſtructions
from his Client.</p>
                  <p>Now, My Lord, I do admit that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
words in this Statute are reſtrained;
that is to ſay, All other matters of the like
nature, not being againſt the right of the
matter of Suit, nor whereby the Iſſue or
Trial are altered. But, My Lord, this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction
hath no relation to the particular
defects that were mentioned before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ours is one, but to the general words on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and, My Lord, we are within the intent
of theſe general words alſo.</p>
                  <p>For this Amendment is not againſt the
Right of the matter of Suit; for that was
whether the Plaintiff's Leſſor had a Title,
and that hath been tried and found for the
Plaintiff; nor is the Iſſue or Trial altered;
for had this been amended before Trial,
the Defendants muſt have pleaded the ſame
Plea, and the Trial would ſtill have been
the ſame. The danger only was at the
Trial on the Plaintiff's ſide, whether this was
not Cauſe of a Nonſuit, and therefore it was
his Buſineſs to have had it amended before
Trial for fear of being nonſuited at Trial;
but having tried his Cauſe, and the Right
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56917:56"/>
found with him, he is much more entituled
to the Benefit of this Amendment, becauſe
it is to ſupport a Verdict; Nay, My Lord,
a Verdict that was found according to the
Right and Merits of the Cauſe, which all
Courts have been always very tender of.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, My Lord, I ſhall offer this to your
Lordſhip. That the matter we pray to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
is not matter of Subſtance, yet ought
to be amended to avoid Abſurdity.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs, that if this had been a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to commence <hi>in futuro,</hi> it would have
admitted of a greater Argument; but, My
Lord, this is a Demiſe in being at the time
of the Declaration, and not yet expired,
and ſo much appears by the Record.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, the Record is an Iſſue of <hi>Trinity</hi>
Term 1696. and the Demiſe is laid the 10th
of <hi>April,</hi> 1697. <hi>Habend.</hi> from the 25th of
<hi>March</hi> then laſt paſt, and the words in the
Declaration are <hi>dimiſer',</hi> in the Writ,
and <hi>demiſiſſent</hi> in the Count; and that
the Plaintiff entred by Vertue thereof, and
was poſſeſſed, and the Defendant ejected
him, his Term being not ended, &amp;c. all which
the Defendant confeſſes.</p>
                  <p>This Demiſe muſt be before <hi>Trinity</hi> Term
96. or elſe the words <hi>demiſer', demiſiſſent</hi> are
to no purpoſe; and it is impoſſible that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Trinity</hi> Term 1696. the Plaintiff's Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
ſhould have demiſed the 10th of <hi>April</hi>
1697. for that time was not come. But it is
poſſible that the 10th of <hi>April,</hi> 1696. the
Plaintiff's Leſſors might make a Leaſe dated
the 10th of <hi>April</hi> 1697. before the time of
the date.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:56917:56"/>
And if that be the Conſtruction of it,
then this is a Deed from the time of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
and the Term commences from
the 25th day of <hi>March</hi> before.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe this being an impoſſible date, muſt
be altogether rejected, and then <hi>Trinity</hi> Term
and the 25th day of <hi>March</hi> being all the
times that are certain in the Declaration, the
Confeſſion is that betwixt the 25th day of
<hi>March</hi> 1696. and <hi>Trinity Term</hi> following
the Plaintiff's Leſſors demiſed, the date be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no eſſential part, and then this is a good
Demiſe for five Years from the 25th of
<hi>March</hi> 1696.</p>

ten Acres of Land to him, and that <hi>J. N.</hi>
had demiſed ten other Acres of Land to

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Pleadings in Ejectment. What ſhall be a
good Plea in Abatement in this Action. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the Plaintiff haenging the Writ. Entry
after Verdict, and before the day in Bank.
After Imparlance no Pleading in Abatement,
and why. Abate, becauſe he ſhews not in
which of the Vills the Land lies. Ejectment
againſt Baron and Feme; Baron dies ſince
the Niſi prius, and before the day in Bank.
Of pleading to the Juriſdiction. Coniſance
not allowable on Suggestion, but it muſt be
averred or pleaded. How Preſcription to the
Five Ports to be made. Ancient Demeſne a
good Plea in Ejectment, and why. Of Plea
of Ancient Demeſne allowed the ſame Term,
and how. Of Pleas puis darrein Continuance.
Entry puis darrein Continuance pleaded
at the Aſſiſes is reaſonable; the Conſequence
of a Demurrer to this Plea. Releaſe from one
of the Plaintiffs in Writ of Error, whom it
ſhall bar. Accord with Satisfaction pleaded
in Ejectment. Aid prier, and why the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
ſhall not have Aid of the King, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of a common Perſon; But a Writ not to
proceed Rege inconſulto allowed. Recovery
and Execution in a former Action pleaded in
Bar. Bar in one Ejectione Firme how a Bar
in another.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE General Iſſue in <hi>Ejectione Firme</hi> is
now ſetled by Rule of Court to be
Not guilty, tho' formerly the Defendant
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:56917:65"/>
might have pleaded <hi>Non ejecit,</hi> or any other
Title; and therefore tho' this <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. may
ſeem needleſs, becauſe by the new Practice,
upon Not guilty pleaded, the Title is only
to be inſiſted on at the Trial, yet in ſome
Caſes ſpecial Pleas may and ought to be
pleaded in <hi>Ejectione Firme,</hi> eſpecially in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour

As on Tryal at Bar in <hi>Ejectment</hi> the
Declaration was of a fourth part of a fifth

It was ſaid the Plaintiff cannot

the King againſt <hi>Farr. Farr</hi> being a Sollicitor,
had obtained a Judgment againſt the Caſual
Ejector, upon which he Sues <hi>Hab. fac. poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionem,</hi>
and the Sheriffs Bay liffs enter the
Houſe with him, and break the Door where
the Goods were, and take the Woman to
whom the Houſe and Goods belonged, and
required of her Special Bayl, and for want
of it brought her to <hi>Newgate;</hi> then <hi>Farr</hi>
took the Goods which were of great value.
And upon <hi>Tryal</hi> at the <hi>Old-Bayly</hi> it appeared,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:56917:135"/>
That <hi>Farr</hi> did this with intent to take away
the Goods, and had no colour of Title to
the Houſe for his Client. He was found
Guilty of Felony, and was hanged, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to Read tho' he were a Sollicitor.</p>
                  <p>The Court was moved for an Attachment
againſt <hi>J.</hi> upon an Affidavit, that he had
ejected one out of Poſſion that was put in
by <hi>Hab. fac. poſſeſſionem,</hi> and that in a very
Riotous manner, and had impriſoned the
Party ſo put out of Poſſeſſion. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

                  <p>Verdict for the Plaintiff was found in
Ejectment. But upon Agreement made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Plaintiff and Defendant, The
Defendant was to hold the Land recovered,
for the remainder of his Term to come, and
according to this Agreement he held it for
two years; but afterwards before his Term
expired, the Plaintiff takes out an <hi>Hab. fac.

               </p>
               <p>A Tryal at Bar was prayed in Action for
mean Profits. But the Court denied it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
how good a Title ſoever the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
hath, he cannot give in Evidence any
other matter than what was before Ruled.
But by <hi>Twiſden</hi> the Title being admitted,
other matter may be given in Evidence, as
a Releaſe or Fine by the Plaintiff: And the
ſame Law is in Action by the Leſſor, in
the former Action as by the Leſſee, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Undertenant, or any that claim
under the former Defendants Title, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the conteſt being for profits during the
time of the former Action hanging.</p>
               <p>So it is ſaid in <hi>Harris</hi> and <hi>Wills</hi>'s Caſe. If
Recovery be in <hi>Ejectione Firme,</hi> and after
Treſpaſs is brought for the mean profits
before the Leaſe, nothing ſhall be given in
Evidence, but the value of the Profits and
not the Title. For if it ſhould be ſo, then
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:56917:136"/>
long Tryals would be infinite. Alſo, if it
be between the ſame Parties, the Record is
an Eſtoppel; ſo the Court held it ſhould be,
if it were againſt Undertenants. But the
Court granted a Tryal at Bar, in aſſurance
they would not inſiſt upon the Points for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
adjudged, but admit it, and inſiſt
upon new Title, <hi>Siderf. p. 239. Collingwood</hi>'s

by the Recital of the Writ which mentions
that the Action is brought <hi>de Rectoria de D.
