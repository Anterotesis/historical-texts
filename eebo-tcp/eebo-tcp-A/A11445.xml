            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IN alleging the holy scriptures although I haue had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies dew regard vnto the tonges, wherein they were first writen, yet I haue specially kept that texte, which hath bene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue these thousand yeres generally receaued throughowt all the weast Churche, and therefore is expounded best, and best knowen to the Latyns. Concerninge the number of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, I haue followed the seuentie interpretours, whom vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally the whole Churche hath followed from the Apostles tyme, namely in the distinction of the Psalmes.</p>
               <p>Concerning the englyshe bible, I haue almost neuer vsed the wordes thereof, partely because I am not bounde therevnto, but specially because it almost neuer translateth any text well, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of any controuersie is in these our daies. And to omit for this present other falsified places to the number of a great many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, these that followe, are found not to be well translated in the onely matter of the Sacrament of Christes body and blood.</p>

For how can light and darknesse agree? But if Caluin saie these words promise the body of Christ only to the faithfull, I aske whether those words be writen in the supper of Christ, or no?

               <p>But seing Caluin teacheth, this, that is pointed vnto, still to remain bread, I see not how those words which (as he saith) point vnto bread, can withall promise the body of Christ.

This Eucharist was the Sacrament of Christes supper, this Sa crament was first made, and then kept for stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, and sent vnto them when they came. Which they receaued as the bond of peace &amp; loue. The consecration of that Eucharist could consist in none other thing so essentially, as in the pronouncing ouer bread, these words, <hi>This is my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now remember, I beseche you, what Caluin iudgeth of our Lords supper. He teacheth those words to be words of promise, and of preaching, Which being heard of the faithfull stirr vp their harts to receaue Christ by faith. But the custom of the primatiue Churche, euen of the first hundred yeres after Christes death, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly reproueth his opinion.

<pb facs="tcp:16931:44"/>
bread was taken and blessed, these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> were said to the bread and ouer it, and changed it into the substance of Christes body. And by that meanes the body of Christ was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined vnder the foorm of bread, and so caried vnto the faithfull Prelats which came to Rome: The Eucharist it self was caried.

But you say Christ deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth Bakers bread, and none other thing to Iudas: Therefore S.

               <p>More then Christ deliuereth him, he can not eate at the supper of our Lord. But Christ geuing (this) deliuereth bread to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, and not his body, as you say. Then how can S. Ihon by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (this) eate the body of Christ?

               <p>The eating whereof Christ spake in his supper, was an eating<note place="margin">The ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Christes supper was bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> by body.

But Christ gaue with his hands, they toke with their hands, and they did eate by the meane of their tonges, teeth, and mouthes. Therefore the eating and drinking whereof Christ sayd: <hi>take and eate &amp; drinke,</hi> was an eating and drinking by body, albeit y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> end of that banket was to feed also y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> soule by that bodily food.

               <p>Lo, that which S. Ihon dranke, also Iudas dranke, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I say, the drinking of the supper.

               <p>I will exemplifie it in an other Sacrament also. Christ at his<note place="margin">

If in deed he gaue them no power, the signification of his words was false, and the toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they make to our eares, vntrue.</p>
               <p>On th' otherside if in deed by that precept Priests haue power to make that thing, whereof Christ spake, then the token was true, and the outward signification of the words agreeth with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward effect and working of them. For which cause we say, that<note place="margin">When the order of Priestho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For he gaue vnto his Apostles at that tyme by those words the order of Priesthod. The holy signe of this Sacrament is, the pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of these words. <hi>Hoc facite in meam commemorationem. Make and doe this thing for the remembrance of me.</hi> The inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grace wrought therein, is the power which the Apostles toke to make the body of Christ.</p>
               <p>Euen so: As sone as these words <hi>This is my body,</hi> and <hi>this is my blood</hi> are duely spoken, straight the body and blood is made present. If indeed it be not present, here is no Sacrament at all. Note well what I say, here is no true signe at all, but an hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall and fonde Imagination of a thing, the truth whereof is not so as the word soundeth, and therefore the sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Neither will it helpe any thing at all, if one say that Christ spake figuratiuely. For a figuratiue speache can not be an euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t token of any thing, except it be such a figure, as through the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of speache hath now obteined some easy and knowen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Christ and God, or by opening the mouth we meane speaking, which kind of speache though it be called figuratiue for some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, yet in dede it is all one with proper speach, because vse and custome maketh euery speach propre.

And consequently no figuratiue speach can be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or a holy signe of an other thing. For a signe is euer plaine euident and able to instruct, as being according to the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of S.

But a figure not made common by vse, is obscure, darke, vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as all ridles be vntill they are opened.</p>
               <p>So that if Christ saying, <hi>This is my body,</hi> had meant (this doth signifie my body, and in dede is not so,) truly no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had bene made (as I will shew hereafter) because no eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent token had bene geuen of any thing. It can not be called an euident token, when I may more truly veryfie the contradictorie then that which is spoken. For if the Sacramentaries teach wel, it is a truer token to say, This is not my body: then to say, This is my body. But this is my body, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer signifie to me by any figure of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For doubtlesse as long as I am not driuen to thinke this is not my body, or to thinke of an other thing as of trees, stones, water, bread, wine, or any like thing which is cleane diuerse in nature from Christes body (which to do after the name of body once heard out of Christes<note place="margin">This is my body either doth signi fie nothing or it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the body of Christ.</note> mouth is allmost impossible) so long it may still be a signe to me that it is Christes body.</p>
               <p>And seing it can neuer come to passe that I hearing Christ say, <hi>This is my body,</hi> can exclude the thought of his body from my vnderstanding, will I or nill I, <hi>(This)</hi> will be to me either a fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod, or it will be the Sacrament or signe of his body.

               <p>And seing the gift of God which might haue bene secret, is now so made that the signe and token of it goeth together with the truth thereof, it could geue from it selfe no other token then it hath nature of his owne. The token of Christ sheweth power of forgeuing and reteyning synnes to be geuen to the Apostles. Therefore that power is in deed geuen.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant that the Apologie (as it denieth this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16931:71"/>

Now it is enough to shew that the word (forgeuing) doth not importe euidently and at the first sight a declaration of forgeuenesse, but an actual for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuenesse in deed, and a signe thereof. Euen as these words <hi>This is my body,</hi> doe importe both a signe, and work a true being of the body, and not a signe without a truth.</p>
               <p>Briefly, it is one thing to consyder, what words any other where may signifie, and an other thing, to consyder what they may signifie in a Sacrament.

               <p>When Christ maketh a Sacrament, he maketh a thing of a dubble nature, to wit, a holy thing, and the signe of a holy thing. But the whole is to vs knowen by the signe. For the thing we see not, neither in Baptisine nor in confirmation, nor in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, nor in Penaunce, nor in extreme vnction, nor in Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod, nor in Matrimonie. The thing, the truth, the grace, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward operation is hid from our eyes, from our eares, &amp; feeling. The signe thereof is sensible and apperteineth to the eyes and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. Now to say that a plaine signe is not made outwardly, it is as much to say, as a plaine grace or truth is not made inwardly.</p>
               <p>Againe, if it be not a plaine signe, it is dark and obscure, it is doubtfull and in controuersie. Wherefore it will be inferred that<note place="margin">An obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re saying is no sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible signe</note> it rather confoundeth our vnderstanding, then teacheth it.

               <p>THere is a great difference betwen a figure of Rhetorike, and a Sacramentall figure made by Christ. The Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call figures consist in words or sentences: the mysticall fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of Christ consist in deeds, &amp; secret workings.

               <p>Christ sometime vsed figures of Rhetorike, because in taking the nature of man he addicted him selfe to vse the kind of speaki<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g which men obserued.

               <p>These are mystical signes, priuie tokens, and secret figures to be kept only among the faithfull, and not to be published to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.

               <p>See now good Reader, whether the Apologie say more truly,
<pb facs="tcp:16931:81"/>
that, the signe or token of Christes body and blood (the body it selfe not being made present vnder the so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>nes of bread and wine as it teacheth) doe more effectuously set before our eyes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> death and resurrection and all the miracles of Christ, or els whether y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> incarnation, life, death, and resurrection of him be not better and more according to the word of God set soorth by the Catholikes who teach that the substance of bread and wine is changed into y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> body and blood of Christ to th'end the death and resurrection of the same body might be effectually remembred.</p>
               <p>So teacheth S. Cyrillus in these words. <hi>Prebet Christus nobis<note place="margin">Cyrillus in Ioan. lib. 12. cap. 28.</note> carnem suam tangendam, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <q>Christ geueth vs his flesh to be tou ched, that we might beleue assuredly that he hath in deed reised his temple. For that the communion of mystical blessing is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn confession of the resurrection of Christ, it is proued by his own words. For he distributed the bread after it was broken, saying, <hi>This is my body, which shalbe geuen for you, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of synnes. Make and doe this thing for the remembrance of me.</hi> Therefore the participation of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mysterie is a certain true confession and remembrance that for our sakes and for vs our Lord both hath died and is reuiued, and through that filleth vs with diuine blessing. Let vs therefore flee infidelity after the tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Christ, and let vs be found strong and stedfast being far from all doubtfulnesse.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far S. Cyrillus. Who alludeth in that place to S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas the Apostle. And as S. Thomas touching the syde of Christ cried out <hi>My Lord and my God,</hi> euen so S. Cyrillus teacheth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we touche the body of Christ when we come to the holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.<note place="margin">Ioan. 20.</note> For as vnder the visible flesh of Christ, his Godhead lay priuie but yet was truly present, and had assumpted his flesh into one person, euen so vnder the visible foorm of bread the flesh of Christ is really present in the holy mysteries, and therefore we
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16931:81"/>
touch that flesh, when we touche the foorm of bread, as S. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas did touche the Godhead when he touched the flesh of Christ. For in eche place we touche not either the Godhead or the flesh visibly, but by the meane of that thing, wherein it is truly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. That thing I say receaued of vs, doth make his death and resurrection to be remembred.</p>
               <p>Hath not he all that euer Christ did, presently before his eyes, who hath Christ him selfe present? But take Christ awaye, and afterward it is a foolish dreame to talke, how his deeds be set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes by bread and wine. The apparence of bread is the token, that Christes body is here to be eaten. And the similitude of wine doth shew, that his blood is here to be drunken. But the true shewing of his death, life, and resurrection, ariseth of that truth which is vnder those foormes.</p>
               <p>When I eate the body that died, I shew the death of it, because<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11</note> no sacrificed flesh was euer eaten before the host was offered. But we eate really the body of Christ, therefore our fact crieth, that Christ is dead. We eate his body aliue hauing the blood and soule in it, therefore our fact crieth, he is risen again. Thus the Ca tholiks reason. Let him that hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sense iudge, who goeth nere the truth of the Gospell, the Sacramentarie, or the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike.</p>

               <p>Wel, you teach not, that nothing is wrought or made in the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Then by like you teach, that somewhat is wrought there.

Here he speaketh first in such sort of his own coming, that his Father (as it appered afterward) might come after the same sort. Then was it the coming of God, and not of man.</p>

               <p>For although God was able to haue saued man otherwyse, yet he swetely disposed our saluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by sending his dere so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to take<note place="margin">It is real flesh and blood which sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs.</note> of the virgyn our flesh and blood. This flesh and this blood wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth our saluacion: Which he y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> taketh away from the Sacrament of the altar, depriueth vs of the meane whereby to come to life euerlasting. For as by this flesh and blood we are redemed: So that redemption is applyed to all that be of lawful age by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> eating and drinking thereof. Now when these preachers cry vnto you, of God, of fayth, of spirit, of vnderstanding, of vertue, they seme perhaps to say goodly things, but they craftily put you from that only meane of fleshe and blood, whereby God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned our saluacion. Abraham was the sather of al beleuers,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> because neuer any mans belefe was so throughly tryed, as hys.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:16931:87"/>
He lacked not grace, vertue and vnderstanding, but he lacked the flesh and blood of Christ: Which flesh when it came really into the world, when it was crucified and gusshed out streames of blood, then the soule of Christ deliuered the soule of Abraham and all the other Fathers out of prison.</p>
               <p>Wel, to end this matter, Christ to shew that he wold be in his supper by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> nature of his manhed, for that cause he named not his person, but his flesh, his body, his blood. And S. Paule named<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.</note> his bones, as you shall see hereafter. Wherefore y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> talke of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence by fayth is vnfaythfull, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> talke of his presence by spirite as<note place="margin">Lucae. 24.</note> thereby excluding his body &amp; soule from our bodies and soules, is spritish and diuelish. A spirit hath no flesh and bones: Christ is with vs in the substance of his owne flesh, &amp; of his owne bones.</p>
               <p>And yet that we might vnderstand that Christ naming flesh &amp; blood, meaneth not that either his flesh is vnder y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> forme of bread without blood, or his blood vnder the forme of wine without flesh, but that vnder eche kinde both flesh and blood and soule and Godhead is: he saith, <hi>he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> blood, taryethin me, &amp; I in hym.</hi> That is to say, when I promise flesh and blood, I name them only to declare plainly, that my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Sacrament is a being according to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> truthe of my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, and not as though I were not there in mine owne person. for he that eateth my flesh and drynketh my blood, dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in me and I in him.

               <p>FOr although we do not touche the body of Christ with teeth<note place="margin">The Apo logie.</note> and mouth, yet we hold him fast and eate him by faith, by vnderstanding, and by the spirit.</p>
               <p>These men haue lost their wits through malice. As who can<note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</note> deuise an eating of meate in a supper, which eating shalbe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching the meate that is eaten with teeth and mouth.</p>
               <p>For in the supper of Christ it is a detestable heresie and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable<note place="margin">Math. 26</note> ignorance to say, that Christ saying: <hi>Take and eate,</hi> did not meane taking by hands or mouthes, and eating by teeth and mouth. Taking and eating is not without touching: Christ sayd <hi>Take and eate, this is my body,</hi> therefore he sayd in effect, touche my body with your teeth and with your mouth.</p>
               <p>Neither doth it skil that his body is immortal and impassible. for though it be not perished by the eating, yet the eating and tou ching is not therefore false, but so much the truer, by how much the meate receaued is the more profitable cue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our bodies. And as we are sayd truly to kisse the Kings knee, when we kisse his hose vnder which the knee is conteined: euen so in touching the accidents of bread and wine, we touche the body and blood of Christ which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined vnder them.

that we might beleue assuredly, that he hath truly reised his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that is to say, his own body. Christ geueth vs his flesh to be touched, and yet doe we not touche it? But how do we touche it? Uerily as S. Thomas touched the Godhead of Christ. For as in<note place="margin">Ioan. 20.</note> touching his flesh he confessed him to be God, because the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head lay hid in that flesh: right so, when we touche with teeth &amp; mouth the forme of bread in the holy mysteries, we confesse that we touche thereby the flesh which lieth hid vnder that forme, and yet the Apologie denieth vs to touche the body of Christ with teeth and mouth.</p>
               <p>And whereas it sayeth we hold him fast by faith, that is true also, but it is not the whole truthe. for as S. Thomas the Apostle did beleue vpon the Godhead of Christ, and withall touche the flesh wherein it dwelt corporally: euen so we beleue the presence of his body, and touch it vnder the foorm of bread, not hindering<note place="margin">Colos. 2.</note> our touching by our belefe, but rather furthering our belefe by our touching, for so much as we touche that visibly, wherein we beleue the flesh of Christ to be inuisibly. The Apologie supposeth holding by faith, to be contrarie to touching with teeth. But we think them bothe to agree right well, and both to be true in their proper kind.</p>

Euen so it is true that we hold Christ by faith, spirit, and vnderstanding in the holy mysteries, but we thereby ought not to take away the truthe of his flesh which is in the same mysteries.

Paul biddeth vs<note place="margin">Tit. 3.</note> vse to heretiks) thereby to prouoke some such, as haue regard to their soules, to repent in tyme, and to persuade them selues that they are not able to geue a new exposition of Christes supper, which may stand with the old Gospell of Christes Church. The body of Christ is the meat of his supper. For thereof he sayd: <hi>Take<note place="margin">Math. 26</note> eate, this is my body.</hi> If then Christ geue him self present in these mysteries, he geneth his body present.

How is it then, that we must goe vp to heauen to be ful fed? But let vs far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consyder your discrete discurse.</p>
               <p>It is said in the preface of the Masse: <hi>Lift vp your harts.</hi> which words you interprete as though it were sayd, your meat is in heauen, and not vpon the holy table.

As much to say, as: Before the incarnation of Christ the Prophetes and Patriarchs called and cried to God them selues, and also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the people to praie for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coming of Christ, therefore when he was come, he was not true God and true man in earth.</p>
               <p>We crie: <hi>Lift vp your harts,</hi> before the body of Christ is made, as beseching God we may haue his body made for vs. &amp; when it is made, we lift the body it self vp, to be adored, and worshipped of the faithfull people as hauing then obteined our desier, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> because it is the true body of true God.</p>
               <p>And yet euen after consecration and after the body is really<note place="margin">Chry so. de Dei natura Hom. 4.</note> present, it might wel be sayd, lift vp your harts to heauen. where by lyfting vp, we should meane nothing ells, but that the faithful men should not geue them selues to wordly thoughts of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth,
<pb facs="tcp:16931:92"/>
of mony, of flesh, but list vp their minds to thinke of euerlasting ioyes.</p>
               <p>Againe by naming heauen, we meane not to denye y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence either of God in the whole earth, or of Christ on the altar, but only to shew that we should looke for another worlde and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> life thereof.</p>
               <p>This argument might haue become a tinkar better then a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, and least of all it could become a superintendent, who ought to haue knowen, that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Church is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> kingdome of heauen, and therefore the kingdome of God is within vs: &amp; that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder,<note place="margin">Lucae. 17.</note> what Christ worketh in his Church and for her sake, is also after one sort to lift vp our hartes to heauen: &amp; last of all he ought to consyder that S. Chrysostom writeth.</p>
               <p>Diddest thou not promise y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Preist, when he cryed: <hi>lift vp your<note place="margin">Chryso. Hom. de Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristia.</note> minds and hartes,</hi> and saidest thou not: we lift them vp vnto our Lord? Will you see a wonderfull matter? The table is furnished with the mysteries, the Lamb of God is offred for thee, the Priest is hofull for thee, a spirituall fyre floweth from the table.</p>
               <p>See what lifting vp of harts was to the old Fathers. It was, to acknowlege the mysteries vpon the table, to beleue the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Masse, and not to deny the real presence of Christ. That is in deed a homely lifting vp of harts, to lift the body and blood of Christ, cleane from the altar and holy table. Such lifting away becometh theues.</p>
               <p>Hitherto these men brought neither any euident authoritie of Scripture, thereby to fortifie their opinion, nor any sentence of auncient Father, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the question of the reall presence. And now I pray you see what worshipful geare they bring. We say in the Masse, <hi>lift vp your harts,</hi> before y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> body is sanctified and made present: therefore it is not made present at all. We say grace before the meate is set vpon the table: therefore none at all is set there.

               <p>Who so consydereth well these words, may vnderstand, that
<pb facs="tcp:16931:93"/>
Cyrillus thought nothing more grosse, then to doubt whether y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> body of Christ be present or no.

               <p>In the tyme of Cyrillus, a great heretike named Nestorius,<note place="margin">Nesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius his hearesie.</note> scholar to one Diodorus, falsely taught that Christ had two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, one of God, an other of man. Therefore they imagined, the the body of Christ (which all the world, euen the heretikes them selues, beleued to be present vpon the altar after consecration) to be the body of man, but not the proper body of God the word.</p>
               <p>This was a very grosse imagination, and therefore ought to be put away from the mind of faithfull men, in receauing the mysteries. Hereof Cyrillus literally said, <hi>Num hominis comesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem<note place="margin">In. 11.

                  </gap>ody of God him self. And therefore Cyrillus sayth afterwar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>: <hi>Proprium est corpus eius verbi, quod omnia viuificat.</hi> It is the body proper to that word, which quickeneth all thinges. Of this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>One thing I wil further note. this fine penner of the Apologie citeth not, where Cyrillus speaketh of these grosse imaginations,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16931:93"/>
because the place is maruelous euident against him. And what foul play is this, to belie Cyrillus, as though he had spoken of that imagination, wherein we beleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reall presence of Christes body vnder the form of bread, whereas he spake, of that wherein Nestorius vnderstanded, that we did eate the flesh of Christ, with out the diuine nature vnited vnto it in one person.</p>
               <p>Cyrillus sayth, because the word which is of God the Father,<note place="margin">Cyrillus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them. 11. ad Eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptium.</note> is life by nature it hath declared his flesh to be the geuer of life, &amp; <hi>hac ratione, facta est nobis benedictio viuificatrix</hi> and by this meanes, the blessing is made to vs, geuer of life.</p>
               <p>Cyrillus calleth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Sacrement of the altar, <hi>benedictio,</hi> blessing, because it is made by blessing. Now in naming blessing, he must<note place="margin">The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist is called bles sing.</note> nedes meane, that which is blessed, which is on the altar before vs, and not any thing co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ceaued in faith or spirit.</p>
               <p>Therefore Cyrillus meaneth out of all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie, that thing which is made by blessing, which we take in our hands, which<note place="margin">Cyrillus natura di uinitatis minime comedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> we put in our mouths, to be able to geue life euerlasting, which none other eatable thing can doe besydes the reall flesh of Christ. For <hi>the nature of Godhead</hi> (as Cyrillus there confesseth) <hi>is not eaten,</hi> by itself, or a part from the flesh.</p>
               <p>If we put this together, I require no more, but that he be an honest man, who shall construe the place of Cyrillus. He shalbe forced to confesse such an eating in the Sacrament of the altar as is not proper to the Godhead: And yet eating by faith is proper to vs in respect of the Godhead, therefore Cyrillus speaketh of eating, that which quickeneth vs to life euerlasting with our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy also, and not with faith alone.</p>

               <p>* But the grossest imagination that euer was heard of, is of them, who affirm no body of Christ at all, to be made really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, vnder the form of bread when it is sayd ouer the bread, of Christ him self: <hi>This is my body.</hi> This grosse imagination, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Christ a lyer, as Cyrillus hath witnessed.</p>

               <p>This dialogue S. Augustine made betwen him selfe &amp; a Iew, not intending any whit, to spcake in that place of the Sacrament of the altar, wherof Iewes ought to know nothing.

               <p>You will say perhaps, If Christ be absent in body, that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not present vnder the form of bread, after consecration. Syr, S.

               <head>¶ The preface of the third Booke.</head>
               <p>THe mysterie of Christes supper was so great, that not only<note place="margin">Gen. 14. Leuiti. 2.</note> diuerse figures in the lawe of nature and of Moyses were by the Patriarches &amp; Priests outwardly celebrated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and not only diuerse predictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were made by the Prophetes<note place="margin">Prou. 9. Psal. 22.</note> concerning the same: but also, when Christ him selfe was come into the world, he did both make an introduction to the promise of his supper by a miraculouse blessing and breaking of fiue and<note place="margin">Math. 14 Marci. 7.</note> seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loaues to the Iewes, and more ouer in expresse words fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that he wold geue his flesh to be eaten, euen the same flesh,<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> which he wold geue for the life of the world.</p>
               <p>But for so muche as some men thinke, that Christ in the sixth Chapiter of S. Ihon speaketh not properly at all (no not so muche as by the way of promise) of his last supper: I must as<note place="margin">Two things are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this booke.</note> well proue against them, who thinke so, that Christ spake in that place of the gift which he afterward made in his parting banket: As also, that the reall presence of his flesh and blood, is euidently proued by such words of promise, as he there vttered. For it can not be doubted, but the truthe it self performed all that in deed it self, whiche his words had before promised for the tyme to come.</p>
               <p>Neither ought it to be a grief to any man, if in handling these matters I seeme to intreat of hard questions, which are aboue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> capacitie of the vulgar people. For the nature of all holy myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries<note place="margin">August. de vtil. creden. ad Hon. cap. 2.</note> is such, that (as S. Augustine sayeth) it may soner be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned popularly and plausibly, then be so defended. Which notwithstanding, I haue done what I can to vtter all things plainly.</p>
               <p>And yet who is there, that now can iustly find fault with me, for handling deepe and obscure matters? Is not euery man sufficiently instructed by this tyme to iudge of all points in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.

               <p>If it be so, let him vnderstand, that the sayd scholar is a very base member in Christes Church, and a very ignorant man, in re pect of those notable Bisshops &amp; other diuines, whom he heard<note place="margin">Of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But of S. Augustie I will speake again hereafter.</p>
               <p>S.

               <p>Whereby we maie perceaue that S. Bernard vnderstandeth the sixth chapter of S. Iohn so literally of the sacrament of the altar, that thereupon he buildeth a couert and a figuratiue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of penance.</p>
               <p>Euthymius noteth that Christ did not say: I do geue my<note place="margin">Euthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius in 6. Ioan. Ioan. 6. Nicolaus Methon.

               <p>Samonas after the wordes of the supper declared, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokening<note place="margin">Samonas in tract.</note> a figure or image, affirmeth Christ to haue said in other places the same thing, and straight reciteth the sixth chapiter of S. Iohn. I omitt here Petrus Cluniacensis, Guimundus, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerus, Lanfrancus, S. Thomas de Aquino, Albertus Magnus, Dionysius the Carthusian, Nicolaus de Lyra, &amp; a great number of late writers, which all agreed vpon the same vnderstanding of<note place="margin">Gonciliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Triden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinum. sessione. 13. ca. 2.</note> the sixth of S.

               <p>But what speake I of these Fathers one by one? not only the Councel of Trident hath taken witnesse for the Sacrament of the altar out of S. Iohn, but also the seuenth kept at Nice, and the

               <p>Yea the whole west church readeth the same gospell of S. Iohn, when it celebrateth the feast of <hi>corpus</hi> Christi daie. And surely whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church kepeth any feast, whereof there is mention in the gospell according to the letter, it alwaies chooseth to reade that part, where the feast is literally mentioned. It wold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">The prac tise of the churche.</note> be very absurd, sith S. Mathew, S. Marke, and S. Luke, haue written so distinctly the historie of Christes supper, to leaue them all, and to reade the wordes of Christ in S. Iohn, if the same wordes had any other sense more literall then that, which belongeth to the supper of Christ.</p>
               <p>So that I trust there is no possible cause of doubting to a sober man, but that the wordes of Christ in this chapiter maie literally and according to the first and chief meaning of them, be brought to declare, what we ought to thinke of his bodily presence in the Sacrament of his last supper. But if any man be not fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied therein, let him reade the processe folowing, and he shal haue lesse cause to doubt any more in this matter.</p>

               <p>S. Cyprian (who is first alleged for the other side) putteth<note place="margin">Cypria. ad Quiri num. li. 3. cap. 25. &amp;. 26. Ioan. 3. Ioan 6.</note> forth this truth, that a man without baptisme can not come t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Hereof we haue mention i <hi>Dionysius Areopagita,</hi> and in S. Am brose. In so much that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very infantes were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> primitiue church in some countries made partakers of the sacrament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> altar.</p>
               <p>Seing then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacament of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> altar was vsed to be geuen straight after y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sacrament of baptism, therefore S. Cyprian ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those two witnesses whiche did belong to those two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, &amp; that is vndoubtedly proued by his owne wordes, for after he had cited those wordes in S. Iohn, it followeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Behold as he alleged two sayings of Christ, so he nameth the two sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts whereof they were spoken. Thus I think it most clere that S. Ciprian did not expound the eating of the flessh of Christ as spoken by baptism only.</p>
               <p>And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lyke may be said of Innocentius, Augustinus, Eusebius<note place="margin">Tob. 2. August. Epist. 93. &amp;. 106. Euseb.

For seing they knew, that no man could come to the eucharist, except he were first baptized (as also Iustinus Martyr hath witnessed) &amp; seing y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Eucharist was namely called the bread of life, whiche who so did eate, he should liue for euer: and who by any fault of his own did not eate it, he should not haue life in himself: moreouer, seing the person bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<pb facs="tcp:16931:113"/>
had not only Christ in him spiritually through baptism, but had right vnto the very Sacrament of Christes supper, and also being of lawfull discretion customably receaued it straight after baptism: these things being so, it is most true, that who so is not at all baptized, he is not only excluded from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> kingdom of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Pelagians graunted) but likewise (whiche thing they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed)<note place="margin">Ioan. 3.</note> from euerlasting life, because he is by all meanes excluded from the food of life, whiche except we eate by some meanes or other, we cannot haue life in vs. &amp; we cannot eate it by any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes at all, that is to say, not so muche as spiritually, except we be first baptized, either in deed or in perfit desire. And being once baptized we doo eate it in some effect at the very font, and really may, and commonly must eate it afterward in the Sacrament to a farther effect.</p>
               <p>So that the reasons of those Fathers do not import, as though Christ meant in S.

For as when Christ saide: <hi>except a man be born againe of water and of the holye Ghost, he can not enter into the kingdom of heauen,</hi> he so meant in those wordes to include his saluation, that would be born &amp; vowed him self to be born again (although by preuention of death he were not really so borne) that yet not withstanding, he meant muche more to haue most men really so born of water and of the holy ghost: Right so, when Christ sayd:<note place="margin">The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptof bap tism, and of eating Christes flesh are like.</note>

               <p>An other argumente of theirs, is, that Christe speaketh of<note place="margin">2.</note> eatinge him by faith, and therefore saith: this is the worke of God, that ye should beleue in him whom he hath sent. He that beleueth in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But it was expresly sayd in the first proposition, <hi>Dabit vobis</hi> he will geue it to you, therefore in the second it is to be supplied, the bread which I will geue to you, is my flesh for the life of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world, that is to say, it is the same flesh which I will offer to my Father to the end the iust men of the world may liue for euer. And so a reason is geuen by Christ why his flesh is that euerlasting meate vnto vs which he sayd before tarieth into life euerlasting. For y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which is offered meritoriously to God for the life of the whole world, must nedes euen by that sacrifice haue strength in it selfe to quicken all that eate it worthely, and to reconcile the parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers thereof to God.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:16931:118"/>Farthermore, when Christ sayd: <hi>The bread which I will geue is my flesh,</hi> he sayd in effect, <hi>The eatable thing which I wil geue is my flesh,</hi> as if it were in other termes sayd, I wil geue you my flesh to be eaten.

They straight sayd, their Fathers had eaten Manna, thinking that Christ was not able to geue them a better kind of bread.

               <p>What shall I say more? The circumstance of the whole talk, the Greektext, the like words going before, the propriety of the Hebrew tong, the vnderstanding of the Iewes, the othe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of Christ geue a witnesse aboue al exception, that when he sayd, <hi>The bread which I will geue is my flesh,</hi> he meant, I that<note place="margin">The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Christes promise.</note> am the true bread, which by incarnation came down from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I that am presently sent and geuen to you to be beleued on of my Father, I will hereafter geue mine own flesh, euen the same flesh which is offered for the life of the world, to be meate vnto you y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wil tarie with me, which haue the words of eternall life.

                  </gap>e taken it, and as all these reasons doe euidently conuince.</p>
               <p>Now whereas they (who dissent from me in this matter) say, that Christ speaketh here of that gift which was common to the whole world, euen to the Patriarchs and Prophets, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it is a spirituall gift (for els Dauid and Abraham could<note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere.</note> not haue partaken it) I answere, that Christ doth not promise in these words any one meate vnto the whole world, but he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his flesh to be eaten, the which flesh is geuen for the whole world. For as at his last supper he sayd: This is my body which is or shalbe geuen for you (thereby geuing vs in his supper a far<note place="margin">Lucae. 22. 1. Cor. 11.</note> better meale, then he gaue to Moyses or Elias) euen so in this
<pb facs="tcp:16931:119"/>
place, when he promiseth to geue vs the bread which is his flesh for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world, he meaneth not that we shall haue no more then Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob had, but that our meate is such as also is the propitiation for<note place="margin">1. Ioan. 2.</note> the synnes of the whole world. By which words it is shewed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> our meat is also an externall sacrifice, and not that it is only a spirituall food receaued by faith and charitie.</p>
               <p>Concerning that daily we may eate y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bread which Christ pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth, it is not against the Sacrament of his supper, which is left to be our daily and supersubstantial bread: Either because we<note place="margin">Math. 6.</note> may come daily to it, or els because being receaued at certaine tymes, it always tarieth with vs, by some spirituall effect, which the Sacramentall receauing worketh in vs. And as the absolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we receaue of the Priest at certain tymes, causeth a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Penance in vs through all our life: so a Sacramental recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Christes body causeth a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall eating of him by spirit. Now Christ so meant to haue his flesh eaten spiritually, that the ordinarie cause of that feeding should consist in the Sacrament of his last supper. for that Sacrament mainteineth our spiritual life as S. Paule teacheth. The last reason of the contrarie part<note place="margin">1. Co. 10.</note> is thus foormed.</p>
               <p>Christ in S. Iohn speaketh of that eating, which maketh vs tary in him, and him to tary in vs. But that is not alwayes the effecte of the Sacramentall eating. for as S. Paul sayeth, a man<note place="margin">1. Co. 11.</note> maye eate Christes body in the Sacrament of the altar vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely, and to his damnation. Therefore, say they, Christ speaketh not in S. Ihon of sacramentall eating, but only of that eating by faith and charitie whereby we maye liue for euer.</p>
               <p>For answere to this argument thus I saye: Sacramentall<note place="margin">The ann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tal eating is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red two wais.</note> eating must be considered two waies, as all the other workes of God towardes men maye be considered. one waye is to consider it in that nature, vertue, and effect which God for his part put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16931:119"/>
in the Sacrament. An other is in that abuse, and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which man wickedly committeth about the holy workes of God.</p>
               <p>Who can doubt but that Christ came into the world to saue<note place="margin">Ioan. 3.</note> men, <hi>vt saluetur mundus per ipsum,</hi> that the world maye be sayd by him? as for condemnation it was not brought in by Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> but by Adam and Eue our first parents, and by our owne wilful synnes ad misdoinges. And yet the holy scriptures witnes that<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.</note> Christ is the sauour of death to many, and the stone whereat they stomble, not through any fault of his, but because they vse their<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.</note> freewil to the worse part with whom he hath to do.</p>
               <p>Euen so cometh it to passe in the blessed Sacrament of the altar. Christ geueth it only to this end, that we by eating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of maye tarie in him and he in vs. For as Isychius hath well<note place="margin">Isychius in Leuit. c. 22. l. 6.</note> noted, <hi>Sanctificationis causa, non autem contaminationis propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit suum mysterium.</hi> Christ hath set foorth his mysterie to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie, and not to spott vs. As he geueth faith to th'end it should<note place="margin">Gal. 5. Iacob. 2.</note> worke by charitie, and not to th'end it should lye dead and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull.</p>
               <p>And in dede so should all men tary for euer in Christ, if they did eate this Sacrament as they ought to do. If nowe they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely come vnto it without contrition, and confession of their<note place="margin">Ioan. 20.</note> synnes, and absolution of the priest, that is not the sault of the Sacrament, which is geuen to make vs dwel for euer in Christ, but it is their fault, who abuse the gift of God to their owne hurte and losse.</p>
               <p>This thing wel weighed I answere, that alwaies the effect of<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental eating, on Christes behalfe is euer profi table.</note> Sacramentall eating on Christes behalfe is the tarying of vs in Christ, and of Christ in vs. And S. Paul saying, that some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue it vnworthely and to their damnation, speaketh not of any effect rising of the Sacrament it self, but only of a negligence and

               <p>Let it therefore stand for a truth (as it is a most vndoubted truth) that Christ in the sixth chapiter of S. Ihon doth prophecie of his last supper, promising to geue in it his own flesh to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as the which is meate in dede, and for his part he promiseth that it shall haue a perfit effect, albeit we sometymes through ma lice withstand his goodnes.

               <p>

The reason which moued some men to think, that S. Augustine meant so, was for that he speaketh much of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual eating and of the vnitie of Christes Church. But that eating is also made, and best of all made in the mysteries of Christes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per when they are worthely receaued, as Christ wold allways haue them to be receaued.

Uerily Christ sayd so much in effect, when he taught that he came not to putt away the law, but to fulfill it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling<note place="margin">Math. 5.</note> of the law without the putting away thereof, is no lesse to say, then to putt the fulnesse of new grace vnder a shadow, which shadow may seme to kepe a resemblance with the old law: so that of two distincte states there must now be made one new middle state of the which the outward parte resembleth the law, and the inward is one with the state of grace.</p>
               <p>Let vs put an example in the precepts of nature to make this thing more plaine. The law saith: <hi>Non occides:</hi> Thou shalt not<note place="margin">Exo. 20.</note> kyl.

Paule, who did yet expresse this matter more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, keping the same diuision, but geuing euery thing his playne name.</p>
               <p>The law had the bare shadow of things to come: The truth,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> is the body of Christ it self, which he calleth also <hi>Rem ipsam,</hi> the thing it self, wherein also dwelleth the nature of God. Now the<note place="margin">Colos. 2.</note> ioyning of a figure with the truthe is called <hi>Ipsa imago reru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the very shape or image of the things. <hi>Vmbram enim habens lex fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turorum<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> bonorum non ipsam imaginem rerum:</hi> For y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> law (sayth S.

               <p>This I take to be the true meaning of the holy Ghost, who doth not in vaine cause the gifte of God by Moyses to be named diuersly from the gift of God the father, and the gift of Christ to differ from them both.

               <p>All which distinctions of geuing, and truth of gifts, the Sacra mentaries by their figuratiue doctrine make voyd, as they doe the reste of the holy Scriptures.

But how it differeth from the fathers gifte, and the worke whiche belongeth to the fathers gifte, there standeth a great part of this question.</p>
               <p>Here I must warne the Reader, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>found not him self. for in ofte repeating what the Father, and what the sonne, why the Father, and why the sonne geueth this, or that: it is to be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red least the mynd gor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The Father, and the sonne, yea the holy ghost also be all one God, and giue al one thing. But the holy scripture, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction<note place="margin">The who le trinitie worketh.</note> of vs, and by reason of Christes flesh assumpted, doth attribute sometyme one thing to the Father, an other to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, an other to the holy ghoste: meaninge most commonly by the name of the Father, God, and the whole Trinitie, according to the whiche appropriation of workes and giftes, we now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to speake.</p>
               <p>The Father is sayd to geue many waies in this chapiter, he geueth faith into our hartes, he geueth Christ to the world in<note place="margin">How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ways y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Father geueth.</note> flesh, he geueth Christ to vs, and geueth vs to Christ.

                  </gap>elf is reall and externall, because he sendeth and geueth his only begotten Sonne in the true flesh of man to be seen, heard, and felt. The Fathers gift, in respect of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue of him, is reall, but internal, spiritual, and without wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king outwardly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> same sensible gift which is wrought inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For after the Father had once geuen flesh to his Sonne, all sensible and externall working was worthely committed to that heauenly instrument of Christes flesh. So that sometyme we say the Fathers gift is reall and externall, but then we meane the visible flesh of Christ in his owne person: Somtyme we say the Fathers gift is only spiritual, and then we vnderstand the faith, charitie, and grace, which the Father worketh in vs, whom he bringeth to Christ by faith and spirit. This distinction well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, I trust to make the matter playne enough.</p>
               <p>The state of our nature is suche, that sith we consist of body and soule, our soule being the chief part of vs, and our body the inseriour parte, God the Father in his gift intendeth to feed our<note place="margin">The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the soule. <hi>Sap. 9.</hi>
                  </note> soules: which being fed, our body shalbe fed, by reason it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vppon the soule. But Christ considering that our heauy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies most commonly weigh down our soules to the pit of hell, wold also inuent a way, that our very bodies might not only not hindre, but rather helpe our soules, and not only through our soules, but also through a meate that them selues should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, be made lyght and meet to rise vpward, and to obey the spirit gladly.</p>

For as he that hath syxe, hath fower: so he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eateth worthely Christes flesh, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth<note place="margin">He that eateth Christ, may eate also of Christ.</note> both Christ, and of Christ, but <hi>not only of Christ,</hi> for he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Christ in his humane nature, wherein the diuine nature dwelleth, and is geuen thereby to be eaten of.</p>
               <p>He eateth of Christ, I say, concerning that effect &amp; grace, which by Sacramentall eating the Godhead worketh in his body and soule. For the Godhead it self is the bread whereof we must par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. But the meane to partake it most abundantly is to receaue worthely y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> manhood, wherein the Godhead corporally dwelleth. Therefore Christ geuing all the spirituall gifts that his Father<note place="margin">Colos. 2.</note> doth, as meane to make vs partakers of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Godhead, geueth also besydes all them, the truth of his flesh and blood in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the altar, as y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meane far y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> highest to ioyne vs most nigh to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> spirit of God. And although his Father geue vs by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment the same flesh and blood which Christ doth geue, yet Christ calleth it for a great reason his own gift, because the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it procedeth from his own person, where vnto he assum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted flesh and blood. For in this Chapiter (as in many other places) by the Fathers gift, the gift of God and of the whole Trinitie is meant. And by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Sonnes gift that chiefly is meant, which peculiarly procedeth by meane of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; strength

               </p>
               <p>Who seeth not nowe the difference betwene the gift that God geueth vs by charitie (which he spreadeth in our hartes) and the gif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The conclusion is, that if the Fathers gifte, which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And therefore they teache, that we receaue in the supper of our Lord with common bread and wine, Christ him self by faith and spirit. But by that meanes Christ geueth a great deale lesse,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:16931:141"/>
then his father gaue. For bread and wine is lesse then the gift of faith, &amp; when Christ geueth faith, he doth it as God, therein being one with his father. Is then his owne gift only bread and wine? Came he into the world to geue a lesse toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then God had geuen before vnder Moyses? For who can doubt, but manna dyd in his owne substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce farre passe bakers bread and wine of the grape? Is this the end of this long disputation, of so many differences put betwene Moyses, God the Father, and Christ, betwene manna, Christes incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; his supper? betwene eating by body alone, by faith alone, by bodie &amp; faith together? Is this al, to haue by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> gift of Christ, only a token of him selfe in bread and wine? how is then the bread, which is eaten, able to make vs liue for euer? if the eating it by faith only at Christes supper, make vs lyue for euer, and yet we had it by faith before of the fathers geuing: then Christe geneth him selfe by none other meane (sauing bread and wine) then his father had done. and doth he in vain (trow ye) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct his own gift from his fathers so many waies? is it then all one to eate of Christ alone, and to eate Christ and of Christ? Ue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily if concerning our taking of it, the thing were throughly one (sauing bread and wine) he wold not make so many differences.</p>
               <p>But if Christes gift (concerning our partaking) differ front his fathers gift in tyme, in maner, in degree, why should it be so, but that Christ geueth for a greater ioyning of vs to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same in truth of nature, whiche his father in faith and spirite gaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the necessarie preparation to the sonnes gifte?

               <p>Although the conference of the words of the Ghospel do proue sufficiently that which I haue sayd, yet I wil shew also that S. Chrisostom toke this chapiter in the same sense that I haue done.</p>
               <p>First he noteth the diuersitie of persons, in that Christ sayd: <hi>se,<note place="margin">In Ioan. hom. 45.</note> non pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly S. Chrysostom noteth, that the word <hi>panis bread,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth either the doctrine of Christ, and saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>and faith in him:</hi>

               <p>Fourthly he sayth (vpon these words, my flesh is verily meat) that Christ sayd so, to thend they should not thinke him to speake<note place="margin">In Ioan hom. 47.

               <p>Last of all he sayth, it is brought to passe by the meat which he hath geuen vs, that we should not only by loue, but also in dede<note place="margin">In Math. hom. 83.</note> it selfe be turned into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> flesh of his.

               <p>I nede not to shew in many lines that Theophilact and Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymius folow y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> same order in expounding S. Ihon, which S.

The figure, that S.

I haue commended to you a certain Sacrament, which, being spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually vnderstanded, shal make you liue. and although that Sacrament mustenedes be visibly celebrated, yet it must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisibly vnderstanded. thus much S. Augustine.</p>
               <p>First I note in these words against the Lutherans, that S.<note place="margin">1.</note> Augustine vnderstandeth the precept of eating Christes flesh of the Sacrament of his last supper. for there only a Sacrament of his death is visibly folemnized, and inuisibly vnderstanded.</p>
               <p>Secondly I note against the Zuingla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s, that the figuratiue<note place="margin">2.</note> speache which S. Augustine acknowlegeth in Christes words, is to be measured and meant according to the natural and custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable speaking and vnderstanding of carnall men, who yet be not fully faithfull. for they thought they should haue eaten Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes flesh torne into peeces, &amp; to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>l their bellies there withal. for in dede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eating of flesh naturally imploieth cutting or tearing, before it come to our month, and afterward chawing with the teeth, and so the filling of the bellye. but in respect of all suche meanings, the words of Christ be figuratiue.</p>
               <p>For seing it is against the honestie of maners to order mans flesh after such a cruel fashion, the Iewes should haue deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed how to make an honest meaning of his words, whom<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> they confessed to be a great Prophete, or at the least they should haue asked of Christ the true meaning of his own words. For
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:16931:147"/>
seing Christ had multiplied siue loaues miraculously to feed them, and did so many other miracles and so much good in al the countrie, that all men who were voide of malice confessed <hi>him<note place="margin">Ioan. 9.</note> to be of God,</hi> reason geueth, they should harken obediently to his words, as the which they might perceaue to be spoken by no meane or common man, and that therefore they should not measure them by their own phantasie &amp; experience. Now then to say, that <hi>except ye eate my flesh,</hi> is a siguratiue speache, is no more to say, but you must not take the eating of Christes flesh so as at the first sight it cometh to your mind, neither concerning the vsuall maner, nor concerning the customable end of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> eating, for that is vnhonest. Tarie therefore vntill you find a better sense. Whiche sense is found when it is knowen that Christ vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the forme of bread geueth the substance of his flesh whole,<note place="margin">Colos. 2.</note> sound, and quick, with the Godhead corporally dwelling in it, to the end we should liue spiritually for euer, by worthy recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it into our bodies and soules.</p>
               <p>Thirdly I note much the kind of speaking, which S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine vseth. For he calleth that thing a <hi>Sacrament</hi> vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> words of the Psalm now alleged, which in his bookes of Christian<note place="margin">Psal. 98.</note> doctrine, he called a <hi>figure:</hi> Shewing him self to take the name of a figure for all that, when a farther and higher thing is to be<note place="margin">lib. 3. ca. 10.</note> vnderstanded then was outwardly expressed, in which case the thing expressed is a Sacrament, to wit, a figure or a holy signe of that higher truth which is to be vnderstanded. but he meant not by the name of a figure either to exclude the truth of eating Christes flesh, or the truthe of drinking his blood, but only the grosse maner of eating and drinking it to a carnal end, which the Iewes thought vpon. for as the killing and eating of the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall lamb was not only natural, but also gaue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> faithful to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ould be both killed on the crosse, and eaten
<pb facs="tcp:16931:148"/>
in a Sacrament: and as the figure which was in that Lamb did not diminish the real killing and eating thereof, but only did refer it to a higher truthe: so the figure, which is in eating Christes flesh, doth not diminish the true eating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but only declareth that eating to be a figure, because it is referred again to a higher truthe, both in Christ, whose flesh that once died is now eaten, and in vs, who eate it not so much for to eate it corporally, as to fede spiritually of God him self, who maketh that flesh profitable. and that S. Augustine thought so, it is euident by his own words vpon S. Iohn: <hi>ye know not</hi> what is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> maner of eating this flesh, but except ye eate it &amp;c. Lo the maner of eating was secret, but the thing that should be eaten was naturall flesh.<note place="margin">August. in Ioan. tractat. 26. &amp;. 27</note>
               </p>
               <p>Again: <hi>Carnem sic intellexerunt, quomodo in cadauere dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatur, aut in macello venditur, non quomodo spiritu vegetatur.</hi> They so vnderstode flesh, as it is torne in a carcase, or solde in the shambles: <hi>And not as it is quickened with the spirit or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi> Here it is reported, wherein the Iewes did erre. They toke the word, <hi>flesh,</hi> amisse, not concerning the substance of it, (which must be really eaten) but concerning the maner of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Modus.</note> it. Is not <hi>modus</hi> Latin for the <hi>maner?</hi> Is not <hi>quomodo</hi> as much to say, as by what maner? The Iewes vnderstode y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> name of <hi>flesh, Quomodo dilaniatur, non quomodo vegetatur:</hi> After such maner as it is torn into pecces, and not after such maner as it is quickened with the spirit of God. Do not these words import, that the Iewes erred in the manner of eating Christes flesh? Doth not he that findeth fault only with the maner of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting flesh, sufficiently allow the eating of the flesh it self, if it be done after a good maner?</p>
               <p>Yea farther, doth not he that sheweth the maner how it may be well eaten, approue that kind of eating it? As we must not

                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ate Christes flesh after such a grosse maner, as is vsed in eating such flesh which is commonly cut into peeces: Right so we must eate Christes flesh after such maner, as it is quickened with the Godhead. So doe S. Angustines words import.</p>
               <p>I beseche thee, good Reader, see the oddes betwene the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Catholike and of a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tarie. He reasoneth thus:<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie.</note> we must not eate Christes flesh carnally and butcharly, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must not eate really y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> substance thereof. We reason thus: We must eate Christes flesh as it is quickened with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,<note place="margin">The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike. Why the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries argument faileth.</note> therefore we must eate really the substance thereof. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Sacramentarie is naught, because a certain vse or maner of a thing forbidden doth not infer, that the substance of the thing it self is forbidden.</p>
               <p>Yea contrariewise, the forbidding of one maner semeth to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence the same thing in an other maner. As if the law say, let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were a sword in the city, it semeth to graunt that men may were a sword in the highe way. And yet because S. Augustine sayth, we ought to take Christes words figuratiuely in respect of such a foule maner of eating his flesh, as the Iewes imagined, the Sacramentarie will conclude, that Christes flesh it self must not be eaten really and substancially at all.</p>
               <p>See on the other syde, why the Catholikes argument is good<note place="margin">Why the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks argu ment is good.</note> and laudable. Euery maner and qualitie which is graunted, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the vse of any substance, doth infer of necessitie the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of that substance. But we may externally in a Sacrament by our fact and dede, as wel as by faith, eate Christes flesh, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo spiritu vegetatur,</hi> after such maner as it is quickened with the spirit, therefore we must haue it substancially and really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, to the end we may so eate it in the sayd Sacrament.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16931:153"/>What meane you by the figure of flesh? <hi>Bread,</hi> say they. That,<note place="margin">Flesh can not signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie bread.</note> say I, is starke false, and vnpossible. For how commeth flesh to be latine for breade? By what grammaticall, by what Rhethori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, by what Mosaical or mysticall figure is that interpretation brought about? All the world seeth, that in proper speach he that wil haue bread, vseth not to cal for flesh. Or if he doe so, I think the butcher wil soner serue him, then the baker. Moreouer no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure wil serue to make one thing meane another, except there be some affinitie or dependance betwene them. but fleshe and bread are cleane seuerall kindes of natures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ neuer in any couenant or truse instituted flesh to signifie material bread. we haue no such Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t neither in the old, nor in the new Testament. and surely sith flesh is neither a naturall nor a diuine token of breade, nor so vsed in common speache, it can not by any ordinarie meane betoken bread. In so muche that the lawiers, who of all men best know the proprietie of wordes, and are most prone to expound them fauorably in the testamentes of men departed, yet haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded, that if any man erre in naming the kinde of thing, as if intending to bequeath his garmentes doe say: I bequeath my siluer, or contrarie wise: the legacie can not hold.

The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie might stand right wel, because bread and wine were instituded by God in the law of nature and of Moyses (as the fact of Melchisedech<note place="margin">Gen. 14.

<pb facs="tcp:16931:156"/>

               <p>The taking of Christ by faith doth not proue S.

               <p>This blessed man alludeth euidently to the wordes of Christ in S.

And how that is done, S. Cyrillus declareth by<note place="margin">Cyril. in Ioan lib. 4. ca. 16.</note> this similitude. As if a man poure wax vppon melted wax, he wholy must nedes mingle the one with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, so it must nedes be, if any man receaue the flesh and blood of our Lord, that he be so ioyned with him, that Christ may be found in him, and he in Christ.

               <p>S.

And therefore it draweth vs vnto it, as leauen turneth the dow to his nature.</p>
               <p>It can not be auoided by these interpretations, but that the heauenly food which we receaue into our mouthes, is the reall substance of Christes flesh. For it is here called <hi>Benedictio,</hi> the<note place="margin">Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio.</note> blessing. &amp; that word is not meant of an inward vertue coming srom heauen, but of that which semeth bread, and is visibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued at our Lords table.

if it were wheaten bread, how could it be true, that a litle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of should draw the whole man vnto it? Doth wheaten bread make vs like it? are we then made vnreasonable, vnsensible, and a corruptible creature, as wheate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bread is? Christ sayth, his meat tarieth to life euerlasting, so doth not wheate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bread. Christ sayth by eating his flesh we tary in him.

               <p>S.

But because I come not to nourish carnall life but spiritual in him, he doth not digest and turn my body into his, (as it happeneth in other meates) but he is turned to be like me. For the real ioyning and knitting of my flesh to his maketh a maruelouse mixture, as if melted wax were poured to other wax, so that a great grace and vertue is left of me in him, whereby he may tary still in me and increase y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fountain of life, which is in him.</p>

               <p>Two things are to be noted in this comparison. the one is the real presence of life: the other is the hauing of it by gift, and by relation to a farther cause or beginning.

               <p>This verie sense Christes words haue, both by the conference of the text it self, and also by the interpretation of S.

               <p>I May be the shorter in this point, because none of those who are meanely conuersant in the bookes of auncient writers (though otherwyse they beleue not well) haue applied these words against the reall presence of Christes body in his last sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. for how can it be, that Christes fleshe, <hi>which is geuen for the<note place="margin">1. de bap. li. 1. ca. 2. 2. in Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. hom. 46. 3. in Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. tract. 27.</note> life of the world,</hi> should profite nothing?

But it is sufficient, to say, that he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented from those three notable pillers of Gods Church before named.</p>
               <p>The second vnderstanding is on Christes behalf, whose flesh should not profit any thing, if the spirit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to say, the Godhead did not make it able to geue vs euerlasting life.

He gaue not his body without his soule and Godhead, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his blood without his bones and flesh: but the spirite quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened al things, eche kinde had whole Christ.

What shall I say more? If the vnderstanding of these words depend vpon the last supper, they must not geue vs a rule how to vnderstand the last supper, but they must take their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of it. Who dare say that bread was crucified for vs, because Ieremie sayd: <hi>Mittamus lignum in panem eius,</hi> let vs put<note place="margin">Hie. c. 11.</note> wood into his bread? Do we not rather say, that because we are sure that the true flesh of Christ was crucified, therefore in Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie bread is taken for flesh?

be referred to the supper, and there we finde bread &amp; wine taken, and after blessing, body and blood geuen, we may be well assured that one truth doth not take away the other.

               <p>S. Ireneus reproued those heretiks, who because men were<note place="margin">Ireneus. aduersus Her. li. 5.</note> called in scripture spirituall, denied the true resurrection of their flesh, as though their spirit only should tary for euer. and yet our new brethern, where so euer mention is made of spirit or of a spirituall body and flesh, so wrast it, as though the reall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of flesh in the Sacrament were by that word denied or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minisshed: whereas it is rather increased, for so much as that flesh which is spirituall is not thereby the lesse true flesh, but it parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the more of the spirit. And because a spirit once created is by the natural gift of God immortal, a spiritual flesh is likewise like to the spirit in that case. S. Augustine writeth, that after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection<note place="margin">August. lib. 1. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractat. cap. 13. &amp; de ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit.

               <p>To be short: The Sacramentaries abuse y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> word of God mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serablie, when they talk of the spirit and of the flesh of Christ in such sort as they do.

               <p>Christ sayd, <hi>it is the spirit that quickeneth,</hi> meaning the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, to make his flesh profitable vnto vs. They take it so, as though the spirit alone did q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>They imagin he sayd: my words be vnproper and cropicall or parabolicall, as being only true by an allegory. Christ meant his words to procede from his own spirit and maiesty, and there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The question is, whether the words of Christ be figuratiue, or proper. I say, that question was decided aboue fiftene hundred yeres past.

informed he wold make some diuine mysterie of that bread.

               <p>And for asmuch as his word affirmed this to be his body, and his dede of taking bread, and of blessing shewed his words to be<note place="margin">Christes words di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the bread.</note> directed vnto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which was in his hand, or lay before him (which was bread before) it must nedes be, that the pronoun <hi>(this)</hi> so shewed to his Apostles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing already subiect vnto their eyes, that much more it serued to teache their vnderstanding verily, this, which appeared to them bread, to be in substance, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the words, his own body.</p>

               <p>Which interpretation is so true, that Christ hath forced vs to<note place="margin">1. Co. 11. Luc. 22.</note> seeke it out, in causing S. Luke, and S. Paule to write: <hi>This chalice is the new Testament in my blood.</hi> For of necessitie we must interpret these words, <hi>This chalice,</hi> that is to say, the thing conteined inthis chalice, is my blood. As therefore <hi>(This)</hi> in na ming the chalice doth serue to shew the place &amp; compasse, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which I must looke for that substance, which afterward is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to be the blood of Christ: euen so <hi>(this)</hi> being spoken of the bread which was taken into Christes hands, doth first point vnto the eye, within what circuit or quantitie the mind shal seke for that substance or proprietie, which afterward the mouth of Christ wil declare. and when the name is once heard, it sheweth it to be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> substance of Christes body. Out of which discourse we may gather two conclusions: The one, that <hi>(this)</hi> beginneth most naturally with the sense of man: The other, that it with the rest of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> speache informeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnderstanding of more then the eye saw.

Which being so, <hi>Hoc, (this)</hi> is in Latin of the neuter gender, because the noune substantiue <hi>(corpus)</hi> body, wherevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it hasteneth) is of the neuter gender. And in the consecration of the blood <hi>Hic, (this)</hi> of certeintie is the masculine gender, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>sanguis</hi> blood, whereto it belongeth, is of the masculine gender.</p>
               <p>Thus the literall sense of Christes words is declared, which ought to be taken for true, vntill the contrarie be proued. But this propriety of words standing (as it ought to stand) marke that whensoeuer any Catholike sayth, <hi>The substance of Christes body and blood to be vnder the formes of bread and wine,</hi> he speaketh not any other thing, then the natural and proper signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Christes words doth geue.

               <p>Admit now that he meant, this doth signifie my body. yet this that doth so signifie, must be sumwhat or other.

               <p>For (this) wil not agree with bread or wine neither in greeke, nor in latin. For <hi>hoc</hi> in latin and <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb facs="tcp:16931:180"/>Now to say, hoc, this thing, (vnderstanding, which is bread) is to correct the words of Christ, as though he had sayd: <hi>hoc quod est panis, est corpus meum,</hi> this which is bread is my body. &amp; yet if it had bene so sayd, the sense must haue bene thus: the substance of bread doth signifie the body of Christ. for that thing which is bread, is to say, the substance of bread. which if it<note place="margin">The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of bread is not pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto.</note> were so, euery substance of bread should be the signe of Christes body, because that which the substance of one loafe is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> substance of an other loaf is also in the same kind. &amp; consequently when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer any man eateth any substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of bread without examining<note place="margin">1.

And consequentlie as the Sacrament was made being yet in Christes own handes, or lying vppon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before him: so it was deliuered with his own hands and by<note place="margin">Christ gaue with his hands</note> none other way (that euer I can reade of) vnto his Apostles. but Christ had willed them before, not to work the perishing, but the euerlasting meate, <hi>which the sonne of man should geue them,</hi> &amp;<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> which he shewed afterward to be his flesh, and now fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

his promise, he geueth the same euerlasting meate with his own hands: which could not be so, except the sayd euerlasting meate were vnder the form of bread or in the chalice, which only the Apostles doe see in Christes hands, therefore it is inuincibly proued by the word of God, that Christes body, which is the euerlasting meate, was and is geuen to them, that communicate vnder the formes of bread and wine.</p>

By carying about, he meaneth all the twelue to haue receaued the drink out of that one cup in order.</p>
               <p>Christ then would, that his twelue Apostles should al drink of the same cup. The reason, why he wold haue it so, foloweth. For (sayth he) this is my blood, as if he sayd, I haue conserated this<note place="margin">why althe Apostles dranke of one cup.</note> cup only, and none other, therefore drink y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> all of this. For if two or three of the twelue should haue drunk vp all that was in that cup, either Christ must haue consecrated the cup again, or the rest must haue receaued a drink not consecrated. But it is not the wil of Christ, that one Priest should co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrate in one Masse any more then once eche kind of the Sacrament, because Christ died but

once, and then he onght to consecrate both kinds together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christes blood and soule must be signified a part from his flesh and his bdoy.</p>
               <p>It is not therefore according to the mind of the Gospell, that (as now they doe in England) when one cup is drunken vp, an other should be filled out of a prophaue pot that staudeth by, as<note place="margin">Thea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>This circumstance doth shew, that it is more then wine which is drunke. This doth shewe that these words, <hi>This is my blood,</hi> work somewhat in that one chalice, whereof all must drink. And consequently that Christ speaketh to bread and wine at his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and not only preacheth to the audience, as Caluin most igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly aud impudently affirmeth.

And yet it is so necessarily meant to be put in Christes words, that when it is left out, the Sacramentaries can not chose but supply it and put it in. therefore Christ meant to haue it stand in his proper and vsual signification. For, seing the verbe <hi>est,</hi> is vsed to be left out, because it may easily be supplied, and may be taken as expressed (though it be not expressed in deede) then the vse which maketh it to be leaft out, as a verbe easily supplied, must by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son make it signifie that thing, which it vseth commonly to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, sith it is supplied by the only force of the vse of speaking. and surely the vse of the verbe <hi>est,</hi> is to signifie the substance of that noune substantiue which hath a peculiar substance, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the words of Christes supper it must signifie the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of his body and of his blood really present.</p>

Christ made that promise, there was nothing in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> whole world, whereof the verbe (is) might be verified in the present tense, but only that substance of Christes flesh, which he had in his natural body. The outward gift of the supper was then to come, &amp; yet Christ sayd of the substance of his gift, <hi>The bread which I will geue, is my flesh.</hi> I say not only that it shalbe my flesh, but I say it is my flesh at this tyme: because the substance that I will geue, is now present with you, although the manner of deliuerance be to come.

               <p>Moreouer S.

All this the word <hi>communicating</hi> doth signifie, and more to. For the bread, which we breake, is so farre Christes body: that it maketh vs also the body of Christ.

But Manna was in one measure to all men. Euen so the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Christes body vnder the forme of bread is geuen to all, that receaue the sayd forme, in one measure and equally concerning the body it self: For euery man receaueth the whole.

For if I doe a thing first, and afterward say to an other, <hi>hoc fac,</hi> doe this thing: if my dede were also the making of a thing (as the making of a chayer, or of a sword) then my word importeth, that he must by doing make this thing. But if my dede were only doing, &amp; not making, as if I did only play vppon a harp: in that case, <hi>hoc fac,</hi> doth not import make this, but only doe as I haue done.</p>

That is to say, by taking bread, and by blessing, and saying: <hi>This is my body,</hi> make my body. Thus doth <hi>facere</hi> stand most properly and truly.</p>

This is the true meaning of Christes words. For so doth S. Paule expoimd them to the Corinthians: where after he had declared the history of Christes supper, of purpose teachig vs what is meant by the remembrance of him, thus he writeth: As ofte as ye shall eate this bread and drinke the chalice, ye shall<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11</note> shew our Lordes death, vntill he come. Lo, the shewing of our Lordes death is the kind of remembrance, for which Christ wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his body to be made &amp; eaten, his blood to be made and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Wherefore saying, make or doe this for the remembrance of me, he sayth this much: Take bread, blesse <hi>saying, this is my body</hi> breake, geue, eate, and all to this ende, that my death may be remembred vntill my second coming.</p>
               <p>Here we learne, that the remembrance, whereof Christ spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,<note place="margin">The reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brance of Christ is the she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of his death by fact.</note> is the shewing of his death, and that not by word only, but by dede and facte, and by making and doing. For the making of Christes body, by chaunging the substance of the bread into the substance of his flesh, is a mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ilouse shewing of his death. For as his death was the dissolution of the soule from the body: so his soule, which (as S. Ambrose noteth) is vnderstanded by the<note place="margin">Ambros. in ca. 11. 1 ad Cor.</note> blood, is shewed vnder the form of wine, &amp; his body is shewed a part from it vnder an other form of bread. I doe not say, that either the body is without soule and blood, or the blood without
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:16931:238"/>

                  </gap>che of which whole Christ is conteyned) is the shewing of his death, and also of his resurrection. For at the death in dede the soule and body were a sonder, and at the resurrection they came againe together: Euen as now in figure and shew they are a sonder, not withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that in truth they are together.</p>
               <p>But if the bread and wine remayned in their old nature still, taking only the name and signe of Christes body &amp; blood: Then should nothing be made for the remembrance, or to shew our<note place="margin">The reall body with the signes of breakig is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Christ spake of.</note> Lords death, whereas he sayd: <hi>Make this thing for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me:</hi> That is (sayeth S.

For then as Christes flesh was in dede broken vppon the Crosse, so it is in shew &amp; signe broken, first in the Priests hands vnder forme of bread, and next in his or their mouths who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with him, by eating and chewing of it. And likewise y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> blood is powred or shedde into his or their mouthes vnder the forme of wine, as it was in dede shed vppon the Crosse, and as in dede Christ there deliuered his ghost into his Fathers hands.</p>
               <p>But if the breade and wine were not changed into the body &amp; blood of Christ: then that body, which at all were not so much as in signe and shew broken (because it were not present) and that blood, whiche were not so muche as in apparence apart from the fleshe, or shed into the mouthes of the receauers, could not shew our Lords death at all, whereas Christ would his own death to be shewed by the making of his own body and blood, with the signes of breaking, shedding, parting and dissoluing. Thou see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> now, good Reader, how the kind of remembrance, which Christ required to he had of him, is not only nothing at all against the

That argument is not good, yea rather this is good: Christ made a perfecte remembrance of his death, therefore his own body is geuen, to put vs in mind, that he died for vs. Now let vs returne to that you said, Christ was not seene of vs.</p>
               <p>If he were seene, your faith should be of small merite, besyde that you could not receaue him into your body after that visible quantitie, wherein he walked vppon the earth. He therefore that died for you, hath now geuen you the substance of his naturall flesh and blood vnder the formes of bread and wine: Where he is as verily present, as if you saw him or touched him. For (I<note place="margin">A thing may be pre se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t though it be not seen.</note> trow) you vnderstand that eye sight is not necessary, to make a thing present: Otherwise, blinde men were in euill case, and to them nothing should be present: Which seing it is not so, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ is not therefore the lesse present, because you see it not.</p>
               <p>But if it may please you to beleue Christ, that sayd: <hi>This is my body, and, this is my blood,</hi> the remembrance of Christes death shall no lesse worke in your mind by reason of your faith,<note place="margin">The faith of Christ his body is as much to vs as the sight of it.</note> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if you sawe with your bodily eyes y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> self same body of Christ, which is vnder the forme of bread. For faith is that to Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which eye sight is to infidels. You must consyder, that Christ ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this Sacrament only to them, that being already Christe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, professe to beleue him in all things. He now telleth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

They died vnto sinne, and mortyfied them selues, to comme worthely to this high banket: and by those meanes they so wel remembred Christes death, that they practised it in their owne flesh, and printed it in their hartes.

               <p>The proposition then being such, as nameth one substance only, and that moste particular: there is no cause, why the verb, <hi>est, is,</hi> ought not to stand in his moste proper and vsuall signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, verily to signifie this one thing, which was knowen to haue bene bread, by Christes word to be the substance of Christes<note place="margin">The body of Christ is not com mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bread.</note> owne body. which if it be once graunted, it will necessarily fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: that this, which is the substance of Christes body, is not also common bread, because those natures were not at any time appointed to be together in any one proprietie of person.</p>
               <p>If it be not common bread, and yet it doth seme so: it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sew, that the substance of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bread is changed into Christes owne

               <p>For as when I heare it reported for certeine, that Peter, who was in the morning at Douer, was seene the same night at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, I doe thereby vnderstand, that Peter passed ouer the sea, not because so much was spoken, but because it foloweth vpon that, which was done: Euen so, when I reade, that Christ in his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent whereby <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But it is a great deale more semely for him, to turne bread into his body: then to turne him self into a vine. Because it is to be thought, he being the wisedom of God changeth all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways for the best. Which were not so, if in stede of him self he should leaue vs a materiall vine: and yet in turning bread into his body, the change is made for the better by infinite degrees.

But (as I was about to say) <hi>the true vine,</hi> being only described by those termes, might be vncerteine to the Apostles and to the hearers of Christ, either because they neuer knew it, or because they haue forgotten it. So that these words, <hi>I am the true vine,</hi> will not as
<pb facs="tcp:16931:249"/>
well proue a transubstantiation, as the other words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> For both the bread, which was changed, was first present, and the body, wherevnto the change is made, is presently she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, taken, and eaten vnder the forme of the same bread.</p>
               <p>It is doubtlesse a great help in prouing transubstantiation, to know both the vttermost partes, and to be able to bring that foorth, into the which the other is changed. For the nature of proof among men consisteth in making a thing plaine to reason,<note place="margin">Proufe.</note> by the meane of senses: and among faithfull men, it consisteth in making it plain to faith, by the meane of the same senses. If one should aske where the vine is, whereof Christ sayd, <hi>I am the true vine,</hi> and ye could not bring it foorth: and on the other syde, if I could bring foorth the body of Christ, into which y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bread were changed: although you might as wel beleue the transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ into the vine through the word of Christ, as I do beleue the transubstantiation of bread into his body: yet you could not so wel proue it, because you could not shew it so well.</p>
               <p>The vine, is lesse then, this vine, and the proof that (this) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,<note place="margin">He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth best who she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the thing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste really present.</note> doth far excede the proof that (the) can make. If an inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition were made, who had done a certeyne murder, and you said the man hath done it, but I could say, this man hath done it: I suppose, all the Iudges in the world wold say, that I proued the murder done better, then you. When it is sayd, the man hath done such a murder, albeit the Iudge beleue the saying: yet his vnderstanding is not quieted, but he asketh farther, which man is that? But when you come so nigh to the point, as to say, this man hath done it: nothing ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be asked more plaine. Which being so, albeit I graunted a transubstantiation in eche saying: yet M. Nowell had not sayd truly in affirming, that these words, <hi>I am the true vine,</hi> do proue as well a transubstantiation, as, <hi>This is my body.</hi> By how much (this) in making proof doth passe (the)
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:16931:249"/>
by so much the later words wold better proue a transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the first.</p>
               <p>Besydes this, when two transubstantiations are affirmed, of the which one hath bene in some like sorte practised before, but the other hath not bene likewise practised: those words which affirme such a transubstantiation, the like whereof hath bene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore done, do proue the sayd transubstantiation better: then those that speake of a thing, that neuer was done.</p>
               <p>Bread was vsually turned into Christes body, whiles he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">Bread was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Christes body whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. <hi>In orat. Catech.</hi>
                  </note> in earth: for his body was nourished with bread, the which bread was turned into his flesh. <hi>Quamobrem rectè nunc etiam Dei verbo sanctificatum panem in Dei verbi corpus credimus im mutari.</hi> Wherefore now also we beleue well (sayeth Nyssenus brother to S.

So that it is no newes for bread to become Chri stes body: but for Christ to become a vine, that, as it is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impossible, because Christ is God and vnable to be changed: so albeit we did graunt it possible, yet it were y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> harder to proue it, because it had not ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Cyrill euen in that place, where he disputeth of the true vine: though not in such order, as I now put them. Which thing I doe, to make his whole mind ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare at once. Thus he sayth.</p>
               <p>* 1. The mysticall blessing, or the communicating of Christes body and blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> * 2. maketh. * 3. Christ, or the life, or the flesh

                  </gap>aith, or charitie, or spiritually. * 8. but also, by naturall partaking. * 9. euen so as one melted wax is mingled to an other melted wax, and in maner made one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. * 10. By this meanes we are both corporally and spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly braunches of Christes flesh, which is also the true vine.</p>
               <p>See now, M. Nowell, how y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> parable of the true vine right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expounded, maketh altogether for our purpose. As Christ is the true vine according to his flesh, so are we the braunches ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">The vine.</note> to his flesh. He is the vine, by hauing his flesh really present and vnited to himself: therefore we be the braunches by<note place="margin">The bran ches.</note> hauing the same flesh really present in vs, and by being really vnited vnto it, as the braunche is vnited to his roote. As Christ is the true vine two ways, by his Godhead and by his manhod: so a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may two ways liue by Christ, by partaking of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and manhod: by habit only, if he haue a good faith: and by partaking his manhod corporally also, if he receaue worthily the Sacrament of the altar.</p>
               <p>But that Sacrament could no more make vs be braunches according to the flesh of Christ, then our faith and charitie doth make vs to be braunches thereof: except it had his flesh really present. For otherwise our faith it self is a better meane to gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> vs into Christ, then bread and wine is: because it is a ioyning of vs to God in a higher degree. But the mystical blessing in S. Cyril is made the meane to ioyne vs to God in a higher degree, then faith or charitie. Therefore S. Cyrill and all the Fathers before him, (whose minde he professeth himself to folow) bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the reall presence of Christes flesh in the Sacrament of the altar: And that by the way of turning the bread into his flesh.
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:16931:256"/>
For the flesh of Christ could not be really present, to dwell cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally with vs and in our bodies, except it were corporally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued of vs. And other way, how to receaue it corporally, I see not: except the bread be changed into it.</p>
               <p>Thus you see, what aduantage, <hi>I am the true vine,</hi> doth bring to the Catholike faith: but no hinderance in the world can be thence deduced against the reall presence of Christes body and blood in the Sacrament of the altar.</p>

reade) or noune substantiue to the participle datum, geuen, (as the Greeks reade) and yet be otherwise ment in his relatiue and participle, then it was being the antecedent or the noune sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiue. Christ sayd, <hi>This is my body geuen for you.</hi> wil you diuide the participle geuen, from his noune substantiue body? If you will not, as the body geuen for vs was the substance of Christes body: so this is the self same substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Christes body, which the Apostles are commanded to take, to eate, and to make.

Euen so Christ meaneth himself to be a moste true and perfect vine concerning the swete frute, which a vine ought to bring foorth and to communicate vnto his bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.

This aduantage we haue by conference of those holy scriptures, whiche speake of one<note place="margin">Matt. 26.</note> matter: that one place geueth light to the other. S. Mathewe reherseth, how Christ taking the chalice, said: <hi>This is my blood of the new testament.</hi> S. Luke sheweth, that he said: <hi>This chalice is</hi>

               <p>A blessing in holy scripture is either a praising of a thing, or<note place="margin">What bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing is.</note> it is the geuing of a benefite thereunto.

               <p>Likewise when S. Paul sayeth, that the Gentils did commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate<note place="margin">Rom. 15.</note> with the spirituall goods of the Iewes (for his word is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Euery where communicating importeth a great and liberall geuing or taking, which can not be fulfilled with the only figure and bare name of body and blood: but requireth the things them selues in truth of nature, as holy Ireneus a disciple of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles scholers writeth against those, that taught that our flesh<note place="margin">Irenaeus lib. 5. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerius haeres.</note> could not aryse againe to glory: <hi>Vani sunt omnes, &amp;c.

               <p>Thus the breaking &amp; distributing of such a bread is the cause of the communicating of Christes body, and such a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating is the cause of ioyning vs corporally in one body, and such an vnion procedeth of the partaking of that one bread in his owne substance. And consequently all things agree well together. But if we once take the sub stance of common bread, to be the thing, which is broken: neither that substance is the communicating of Christes body (because euery bread in the world should by like reason be the communicating thereof, for so much as that, which is the substance of any thing, is in euery particular propriety of the same kind) nor we are not all one material bread, as it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: nor we all partake not of one wheaten bread, either in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, or after.</p>

This place, good Reader, openeth al the hard points of the mystery of vnitie.</p>
               <p>First, Christ toke truly flesh. Next, we take truly the same flesh vnder a mystery. By his taking, God and man were made one, concerning the whole nature of man. By our taking, we and Christ are made one concerning euery particular man, who receaueth worthely his body. And that is not only done so, but withall it is shewed so: for the thing, which we receaue, is the flesh of Christ vnder the forme of bread. The flesh, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is there being receaued, maketh vs in dede to be one with Christ. The form of bread sheweth not only them to be one, that receaue this food: but those also, who now doe not receaue it (if yet they be, or shalbe baptized) to be one in Christ. And sayeth S. Hilarie so much? Ye doubtlesse, and that he twise repeteth.</p>
               <p>For when he sayth: <hi>Verè sub mysterio carnem corporis sui su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mimus,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16931:273"/>
we take truly vnder a mysterie the flesh of his body: then<note place="margin">Under a mystery.</note> he meaneth, that <hi>vnder the forme of bread we take Christes flesh.</hi> Under what other mysterie can it be sayd, we take it? Or seing he speaketh of the last supper, doth he not meane the signe of the same supper, which was bread? But yet let vs heare more plaine words.</p>

               <p>S.

                  <hi>This</hi> (sayeth S.

               <p>It is well knowen, that the Priests of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Church taking bread and wine, according to the institution of Christ, consecrate them saying in Christes name: <hi>This is my body, and this is my blood.</hi> If by those words the body and blood of Christ be not made pre sent vnder the forme of bread and wine: how is the Church offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the offering, which she maketh?

               <p>The same reall coniunction of the faithfull to Christes flesh may be declared also by the example of building a howse. For as euery howse is in the fundation moste large, and afterward it is drawen alwaies so muche the nigher together, by how much it approcheth to the top or end thereof: euen so <hi>the Church being</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>the howse of God</hi> must be one, so that it may in some partes thereof be ioyned together in the top it self, which is the flesh of Christ.</p>
               <p>For they that are one mysticall howse by faith and charitie alone, they are one in the fundation through the spirit of God: but not yet one in the top. And the vnitie of that fundation wold<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> not cause them to be a perfite howse, if some stones being reised thereon, did not at the length mete really together in the top of<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> the building, which is the flesh of Christ: through the connexion of which stones, those also which laie in the lowest place, may be sayd to mete in the top: for that they are necessary and substancial parts of that howse, which is builded from the lowest parte of the ground vp to the very highest top.</p>
               <p>Faith is the fundation and ground of the things, which are<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> hoped for. Baptisme goeth nerer the top, because beside the grace of faith, it partaketh some other grace proceding not only from<note place="margin">Chrysos.</note> the spirit of Christe, but also from his flesh: in that the water, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording<note place="margin">Hom. 16 ad Rom.</note> to the minde of S.

For when S, Paule had said, that <hi>the husband is head of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as Christ is head of the Church:</hi> he prouoketh the husbands <hi>to loue their wiues, as Christ hath loued his Churche.</hi> Who haue loued it so intierly: that <hi>he hath cleansed it in the washing of water and the word, to thend he might make him self a gloriouse Church without spot or wrinkle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold, baptisme is a token of Christes loue, but to what end? That he might haue a cleane spouse. To what purpose? Will he then come nere to his wife: and, as it were, be cloupled with her? Yea verily, not for any fleshly pleasure: but to nourish her by his reall flesh. And therefore S. Paul goeth forward, saying: <hi>Husbands ought to loue their wiues, as their own bodies. He that loueth his wife, loueth him self. And surely noman euer hated his own flesh, but he nourisheth and cherisheth it, as Christ doth his Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What meane you S. Paule? Is then the Church the flesh of Christ? For your words import so much. He answereth, it is so. <hi>For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this cause the man shall forsake Father and mother, and shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be ioyned to his own wife, and they shalbe two in one flesh. This<note place="margin">Genes. 2.</note> is a great Sacrament or mysterie, but I meane in Christ and the Church.</hi> Hitherto S. Paul hath prouoked the husbands, to loue and to cherish their wiues, as Christ hath loued his Churche in cleansing it through baptisme, and as he cherisheth it, as being members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</p>
               <p>Note, that as the loue of husbands toward their wiues is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>When we are borne again in Christ, we are made members of Christes body: and therefore those words, <hi>Membra sumus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris eius, we are members of his body,</hi> may be ment of baptisme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where we are made members of his my stical body, according as S.

               <p>So doth S. Ireneus take these words. For S.

               <p>SAint Paule intending to dissuade the Corinthians from ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking with the Gentils at their false and vaine sacrifices, vseth in that behalf, this kind of argument.</p>
               <p>Whosoeuer doth eate or drink that, which is offered vp in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, he is made one with the oblation it self, and with it, to whome the things eaten and drunken are offered.

                  <hi>bread.</hi> The like is sene also in the carnall Iewes, among whom they that eate the oblations or things offered, thereby <hi>were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the altar:</hi> to wit, of the sacrifice, and of the worshipping of God, to whom it was offered. Therefore if the Corinthians<note place="margin">The Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>For although the dead ydoll be no true God, nor any thing at all, wherewith they may communicate: yet a societie is ioyned thereby with the deuils, who reigne in those ydols. Therefore as ydolatry it self: so the eating of the meates offered to ydols is to be auoided. Out of this discourse it is proued, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, Iewes &amp; Gentils, eche of them haue a God, true, or false: eche of them offereth an externall sacrifice to him: eche of them vse to partake of the things offered: and eche of them communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated among them selues.<note place="margin">The sacri fice of the Iewes.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The meat offered and eaten of the Iewes was the flesh of such cleane beasts, or such other oblations as were allowed by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lawe of Moyses. The meate offered and eaten of the Gentils, was<note place="margin">Of the Gentils.</note> such, as their superstition had receaued. To one ydol a shepe was offered, to another an oxe. The meate offered and eaten of the<note place="margin">Of the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</note> Christians is described of S.

               </p>
               <p>Uppon which ground it may be wel built, that the meate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken at Christes supper is the body and blood of Christ: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we passe and ouercome the Iewes &amp; Gentils, who had other earthly oblations, but none of them had this foode, which came
<pb facs="tcp:16931:280"/>
down from heauen. For as S. Paul sayeth: <hi>We haue an altar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>whereof they haue no power to eate, who serue the tabernacle.</hi> But surely they might eate bread and wine, who serued the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle: therefore the meate of Christes supper is not bread and wine, but the bread of life, and the blood of Christ. And whereas the Iewes had certeyn obseruancies of eating this, and of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that meate: or that the Leuits should eate this, and the Priest that, and the laye people an other meate: S. Paule coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selleth them <hi>to stablish their hart with grace,</hi> and not so carefully to obserue the old law, which commaunded so many differences of meate.</p>
               <p>How beit if it be a good thing to haue some meates reserued for the Priests, which the common people may not eate (as the Iewes think) then sayeth S. Paule: we Christians also <hi>haue an</hi>

                  <hi>altar,</hi> to wit, <hi>a thing offered vnto God,</hi> and that so preciouse, that the very Priests and Bisshops, who serue in the tabernacle may not eate thereof. That meate is as Theodorite sayth: <hi>Hostia ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalis</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In 13. ad Heb.</note>

               </p>
               <p>This then being the meate of our altar, it foloweth, that this<note place="margin">The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the holy meates.</note> meate is no lesse present vppon his holy table: then that, which the Iewes or ydolatours did eate, was present at their sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

                  </gap> flesh is really present, and is receaued into our mouthes. The meate of the Iewes and of the Gentils was made one natural flesh with the partakers thereof: therefore we likewise are made one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall flesh with the meate of Christes tab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But herein is the oddes, that their meat was turned into their

               <p>Again, as the Iewes and Gentils by eating meates offered vp, are made one body among them selues, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formitie of wil and mind alone: (because the meate was not able to tary in his own nature, and to draw them vnto it) so contrariwise we that eate Christes body, are made really one flesh with Christ &amp; amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g our selues: because (as S.

                  </gap>sh of any creature, whiles it yet liueth and hath blood in it? Or how can blood be drunken in a cup, if it be yet in the veines of the body? The nature of the fact is such, that it presupposeth the immolation, and sacrifice, and death of that holy thing, which is eaten: for a liuing and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature is not vsed to be eaten, without it be depriued first of his life.</p>
               <p>Therefore Theophilact sayth: <hi>Quinta vesperi fecit Dominus<note place="margin">Theoph. in 28.</note> coenam, &amp; caet. Nemo enim quicquàm edit, nisi prius mactatum fuerit. The fift euening (which was on Maundy Thursday night)<note place="margin">Math.</note> our Lord made a supper, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And so, because he was of power to lay down his soule: it is euident, that he then sacrificed him self from that tyme, wherein he deliuered the Disciples his body. For no man eateth any thing, vnlesse it be first killed.</hi> Thus we see, that the reall presence of Christes flesh, to th'end it may be eaten, is the consequent, whereby S.

               <p>Who perceaneth not, that it is a good argument, to say: I eate in a Sacrament Christes reall flesh, there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>sh and drink the blood of that thing, which is not yet dead and offered in a sacrifice? This argument of S.

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:16931:281"/>
dead, as he should be figuratiuely eaten. Neither could it folow, that because Christ is eaten by faith in a figure: therefore he is already dead in truth it self, but only that he is dead in a figure or in bare name, without the truth of death as yet presently shewed.</p>
               <p>When the Paschall Lamb was eaten, the Lamb was truly dead: but as the Lamb was the figure of Christ, and not Christ: did it thereof follow, that it was only shewed in a figure that Christ sometyme should dye, and not that in dede he was dead? But now that he is dead in dede, and so dead, that his death is shewed true by the eating of his own body, and by the drinking of his own blood: vndoubtedly, as truly as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Wherefore S. Ambrose sayth, vpon this place: <hi>Quia enim mor<note place="margin">Ambros. in 1.

               <p>Albeit God meant not his body and blood to be eaten and drunken after the common &amp; vsual manner of eating rosted flesh, or drinking raw blood, but that we should eate it &amp; drinke it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forms of bread &amp; wine.

               <p>Here S. Bede expoundeth the rendering of the vowes of Christe to be the offering of the very same body &amp; blood, which was offered vpon the crosse: And that the good see by faith, and vnderstand by beleuing more, then the eye seeth. But the euil men will vnderstand no more, then they see: iudging that which<note place="margin">The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of euill men.</note> semeth bread and wine, to be still in dede bread and wine.

               <p>Concerning my purpose S. Hierome, S.

               <p>In which interpretation the Fathers agree so throughly, that they conferre those words of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>S. Bede expoundeth the adoring thus: <hi>Adorabunt, quia cum<note place="margin">

But through their hypocrisie it consisteth only in bowing their bodies, because other men do so, and not in true and perfite charitie of God.</p>
               <p>Moreouer S.

               </p>

They also moued with the fame of his highnes, and with the glorie of his name (which glorie is spred round about in the Church) they come them selues to the table, they eate and adore, but yet they are not filled, because they doe not hunger and thyrst righteousnes. Hitherto S. Augustine,
<pb facs="tcp:16931:298"/>
who speaketh of eating the body of Christ <hi>from the table.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The riche men come to the table of Christ thence to eate his<note place="margin">From the table they eate and adore.</note> body. There also they adore that which they take from the table, and that which they eate. And how is it possible, but that this worshipping and adoring (whereof S. Augustine speaketh) must belong to the table of Christ, that is to say, to his body aud blood which is eaten from his table, when the Priest geueth it to vs? And yet it might not there be rightly adored, if it were not rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore this prophecie as wel proueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> adoration, as the real presence of Christes body and blood. Is it not a great blindnes in our new preachers, that whereas the word of God sayeth euen the riche of the earth haue eaten and haue adored, or shal eate and shall adore, (for so one tense doth stand for an other in the holy Scripture) yet they wil haue ye eate, and not adore, to th'intent ye should be more vnkind, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>If men will not affect blindnesse, it is easy to vnderstand: that all corporall natures consist of an inuisible substance, and of a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible forme. The forme of Christes body was that, which the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pharnaites<note place="margin">The body sene.</note> saw: but the substance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> Christes body is that, which we must eate.

               <p>But the forme &amp; shape of that substance we eate not: for Christ hath geuen it vs vnder the forme of bread, &amp; his blood vnder the form of wine.

That was the vnderstanding, which being denied to the proud &amp; stubborn Chapharnaits (who<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> would not beleue) was reueled to the humble Apostles, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried<note place="margin">Cyrill. li. 4. in Ioa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. cap. 14.</note> with him vntill his last supper.</p>
               <p>There they lerned, how the same body was geuen them to be eaten: which was taken of the virgin, and which was betraied for vs: And yet not that, which the Capharnites saw: the same in<note place="margin">The same &amp; not the same.</note> substance, but not the same in apparence. For Christ taking bread sayd, This is my body, which is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for you: take &amp; eate. There<note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> the Apostoles saw that, which semed stil bread: but vnder the form of the bread Christ gaue the selfe same flesh, wherein he walked in this life: and he so gaue it, that it might be adored not only whiles it was eaten, but before: for no man eateth it, <hi>nisi prius adorauerit,</hi> except he adore it before.

               <p>S. Augustine was so fully persuaded, that the flesh of Christe was to be adored vnder the forme of breade after consecration: that he teacheth the Christian people to adore it, not as common flesh, but as the flesh of God, for whose sake we adore it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore<note place="margin">Earth, that is to say Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes flesh.</note> he saith: <hi>Cùm ad terram quamlibet, &amp;c.</hi> When thou bowest thy self, or fallest down before any earth, looke not vpon it as earth: but looke vpon that holy one, whose fotestoole it is whiche thou adorest. for thou adorest for his sake.</p>
               <p>S. Augustin calleth the flesh of Christ <hi>earth,</hi> because flesh was made of earth. And Christ toke flesh of our Ladies flesh. This flesh he calleth earth. And for asmuch as he had said, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did eate that flesh, except he had adored before: he sheweth, how
<pb facs="tcp:16931:301"/>
we must adore, verily not resting vpon the earth, to wit, vppon the flesh of Christ: but looking to his person, in whom that earth resteth, as if he said: the footestole is to be adored for his sake, that sitteth on that stoole.</p>
               <p>But now, good Reader, I besech thee, as thou hast care of thy saluation, and doest desire to be enformed of the truth concerning the adoration of this Sacrament, to ponder well these words, <hi>Ad terram qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>libet cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> te inclinas atque prosternis.</hi> when thou bowest or laiest thy selfe prostrate before any earth. What meane these<note place="margin">Terra quaelibet.</note> words, <hi>Ad terram qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>libet,</hi> before any earth? Hath Christ moe fleshes then one? For by earth, thou knowest, he meaneth Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes fleshe.</p>
               <p>What is it then to say, before any earth? Doubtlesse before any hoste consecrated. Doubtlesse before any flesh of Christ, made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the forme of bread and wine. that is called any earth, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ hath any moe then only one body and one blood and<note place="margin">The only one fleshe of Christe is vnder many formes of bread.</note> one earth, which is to be adored: but because that one earth is in many places, after the sorte I said before: to wit, vnder many formes of bread.</p>
               <p>That is it, which S. Augustine saith: <hi>when thou bowest thee,</hi> or doest cast thy selfe prostrate before any flesh of Christ, in what soeuer Church, house, or place, in what soeuer altar, pix or table, where soeuer thou fallest doune prostrate before the Sacrament of the altar: adore it, so that thou remember the flesh is to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the persons sake, whose flesh it is.</p>
               <p>By this place it is inuincibly proued, that it was the custome<note place="margin">The only sense of S.</note> of all Catholike people in S.

               <p>Can there yet a more lewd and foolish pointe be added to this opinion? Yea verily. They that teache the worshipping of the Sacrament of the altar to be idolatry, say: the Bishop of Rome was the cause of that worshipping, they teach also the Bishop of Rome to be Antichrist: whiche Antichrist is well knowen to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne by al meanes the honour of Christ.

Who euer saw a doctrine so euill hanging to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?</p>

Behold, Antichrist setteth him selfe<note place="margin">The pope is not like Antichrist</note> against Christ, and much lesse would he be content (as the Pope is) to call him self the vicar of Christ, or seruant of his sernants.</p>
               <p>Againe, Antichrist is aduanced aboue all that eyther by nature or by deceite of the Deuill is worshipped.

That faith of theirs<note place="margin">1. Co. 15.</note> ioyned with those words of Christ proue to me, that it is his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and therefore no idol. Moreouer, I thinke my self bound, to beleue the Prophetes: who sayd, Christ should destroy y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> idols of the earth, which literally is by S. Athanasius, S. Hierome, S.

Such a worshipping, after the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation<note place="margin">Externall idolles be destroyed.</note> of Christ, is decayed in the whole world euen among infidels: much more it ought to be decayed among the faithfull. And yet, if our idolatrie be any, it is externall.</p>
               <p>What say wee then? Is there now a days no idolatry in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome? Are there no false Gods worshipped? yes doubtlesse<note place="margin">Outward idolatry.</note> to many. But idolatry partly is outward, partly is inward. The outward idolatry is decayed by the outward and visible coming of Christ into the world: The inward is decayed by the faith and charitie of good people. But because not al, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be outward Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,<note place="margin">Inward idolatry.</note> be the true seruantes of God: therefore they still worship idols in their hartes. They <hi>adore mony,</hi> for the desier where of<note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> they sel benifices and cure of soules without feare, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent<note place="margin">Eph. 5.</note> to robbe euen Churches and monasteries: although they thinke wel inough both of Priests and Monkes, as they vse to say.</p>
               <p>These inward idols bee not taken away, but where Christ is inwardly professed. And for asmuch as likewise y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> outward idols be taken away, where Christ is outwardly professed: it can not be, that those, who beare the name of Catholikes and Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, should adore by common consent any outward idoll.

For we may not come (being of lawfull age) to any of those or such like holy mysteries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due disposing our selues to repentance for our synnes, and to amendment of our life.</p>
               <p>The second point of the difference betwene Christes supper &amp;<note place="margin">The second.</note> other things is: that in the Sacrament of his supper we must examine our selues, euen for the respect of the substance of that meate, which we receaue. In baptisme we try our selues not for any honour, which is due to the water: but for the obteyning of the grace, which is geuen in that Sacrament. But in the supper a farther difference is to be made. What is that? The very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which is taken, is to be honoured and adored.</p>
               <p>That is it, which S. Chryso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

properly belonging to Christes supper is, to make a difference of this substance from al other substances. That is the difference, whereof S. Ambrose saith:</p>

               <p>I seke not hereby to declare only, that S. Augustine is of the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:16931:309"/>
mind to haue the Sacrament and the meate receaued into our mouthes to be worshipped with a singular duety: but much more to shew, that he affirmeth S. Paule to meane so. For the fault of the Corinthians was not, to discerne this meat with a worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping singularly due. For if they had worshipped it, as it ought to be worshipped: they would not haue taken it in their mouthes without they had first prepared them selues for the receauing of such a meate, so singularly to be worshipped.</p>
               <p>What figuratiue interpretation wil now serue? Is not <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum honorare,</hi> good latine?

Is it not plainly said, <hi>cibum illum discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere à caeteris cibis veneratione singulariter debita,</hi> to discerne that meate from other meates by a worshipping singularly due? Is that a worship, which may be geuen to any creature, which is not vnited to God? The meat in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mouth must be so honoured, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that in the mouth is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> real, substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cial, natural body of Christ. The Sacrament must be honoured, therefore the substance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conteined is the body of Christ.</p>
               <p>Otherwise, shall we think, that S. Augustine, who so diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">Aug. de ciui. Dei li. 10. c. 1.</note> always disce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Did that greate Clerk so litle vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, what singular worship was: that he gaue that name not only to holy men, or to the iust Angels, but euen to the vnsensible creatures of bread and wine?

               <p>Last of al, what should it meane y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> S. Augustine saith: y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be honoured by our absteining sometimes from recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it into our mouthes? It Were surely no honor done to God, if we should at any moment absteine to fede vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him in faith or spirit. Why is it then some honour to his Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in certaine cases? Was it not counted a vertue in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Matth. 8.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he said him self to be vnworthy, that Christ should enter vnder the roof of his house? And yet the same Centurion did not refuse, to receaue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> effect &amp; grace of Christes word into his house. There is therefore a difference betwene the corporall coming of Christe into our house or body: and betwene the coming of his grace into our hartes. His grace can not come, except we first be made mete to receaue it: but his body may come to our bodies, &amp; so may condemne our soules, before that we are made mete to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue it.</p>
               <p>His grace therefore must come first to vs by faith and charitie, that we may thereby haue power to receaue worthely afterward his blessed body: least if we receaue it vnworthely, we take it to our damnation. But so great preparation should not be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, if our bodies receaued none other substance besyde bread and wine: for they are of baser degree, then eating by faith is. But now we may somtime absteine from the Sacrament euen for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reuerence, whiche we beare to it: and yet we may not absteine from eating by faith or spirite. Therefore it is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier kind of substance, which is receaued in the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: then
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:16931:310"/>
the grace is, which is the effect of spirituall eating.</p>
               <p>And seing it should not be a worthier thing, if it were the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of bread and wine: we may be assured, the substance of the Sacrament to be that selfe body, whereof the Centurion sayd: <hi>Lord, I am not worthy, that thou shouldest enter vnder my roof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the honour of that body, whiche S. Paul and S.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they were Barbarous men: but S. Chrysostome spake to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, who were most ciuill &amp; leste Barbarous of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the world. So much the rather they ought to know it to be their duety, to worship the body of their maker.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the wise men saw Christe in a manger, where such things are not wont to lye, as must be reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced &amp; worshipped: but thou seest this body <hi>vpon the altar,</hi> which is a place made for holy things to stand on. And so much the more ought we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to adore the body of Christ being set before vs vpon the altar: then those wise men did adore it in a manger.</p>
               <p>They saw it also in the mothers armes, which was a woman: neither is any thing, which a woman holdeth &amp; bringeth foorth, wont to be worshipped with Godly honour. Seing therefore, thou seest y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> priest present, who is wont to handle Godly things: it were a farre more impiety for thee, not to adore Christes body at the time of masse, when thou art assured by the worde of God<note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> (who sayd to his Apostles, &amp; in them to al priests) <hi>doe and make this thing,</hi> that the holy Ghoost faileth not at the consecration to work the body of Christe really present.</p>
               <p>All this consydered, it is not possible for any man, that lyeth not wittingly and willingly, to say, but that S. Chrysostome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>aught and beleued, the body of Christe to be really present, and
<pb facs="tcp:16931:314"/>
that it ought to be really adored vpon the altar it self, or in the<note place="margin">In 1. Co. Hom. 24</note> priests hands. And therefore he saith afterward, <hi>Quod summo honore dignum est, id tibi in terra ostendam.</hi> I wil shew thee that in the earth, which is worthy of the highest honour.</p>
               <p>How can S. Chrysostome shew any thing in earth worthy of the highest honour, besyde the body and blood of Christe vnder the formes of bread and wine? For by that, which is worthy of highest honour, he mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And in saying, <hi>he will shew it thee,</hi> he can possibly meane none other thing, but that shewing, which is by the formes of bread and wine. For if any man should require him, to shew that most high thing, which he promised to shew: questionlesse he would lead him to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> altar, &amp; there would shew him, that which had bene consecrated by the Priest, and he would say vnto him, pointing to the mysteries: this is the body of Christe, and this is his blood. For by that meanes only were he able, to performe his promise of shewing that thing, which is worthy of the highest honour.</p>
               <p>It followeth yet more plainly in S. Chrysostome by an other similitude. As in the palacies of kings (saith he) not the walles, not the golden roof, but the kings body sitting in the seate of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, is the worthiest thing of all: so is the body of Christe the<note place="margin">The body of Che<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>If the interpretation of the Heretikes should be admitted,<note place="margin">Theodo retus dia log. 2.</note> they might say the very same of Christes incarnation: and so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, what so euer is sayd in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Bible or in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Fathers touching his flesh, to be meant of a phantasticall appering of flesh, but not of true flesh.

               <p>This place is such, as can not be reasonably answered vnto.

And no wonder. For seing it is one body, whether it be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in heauen, or vpon the altar: one worship is always due to it.</p>
               <p>Thus we haue witnessed by Theodoretus, that the holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Christ are worshipped and adored: not as the signes of his body aad blood, but as being in dede his body and blood.

But the people of the primatiue Churche well knowing the things that were shewed to be the most holy of all holies (because they are the body &amp; blood of Christ) yet wil not acknowledge them selues to be holy: and therefore do aunswere, that there is one holy, and he their Lord Iesus: whiche words Cyrillus of Hierusalem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth thus:</p>

               </p>
               <p>By conference of these places we vnderstand, that the Priest by saying, <hi>holy things for holy men,</hi> warned: that none should comme, but those, that were cleane from synne. And yet those, that were holy, might not receaue: before they had acknowleged and confessed by theyr fact and word <hi>the king to be present.</hi> The confession by wordes, was to answer the Priest: <hi>one holy, one Lord, Iesus Christ.</hi> The confession in fact &amp; dede, was, <hi>to bow doune bodily, and to adore the holy things:</hi> which are the body and blood of Christ, and Christ him self.

               <p>The eleuation of the consecrated host was made for these two purposes: that the king of glory should be worshipped vnder the form of bread, &amp; receaued of holy men. By worshipping we con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Thus I haue proued the adoration of Christes body &amp; blood, euen as it is a Sacrament, out of the Prophetes, out of S. Paul,<note place="margin">Ps. 21. 98 1. Co. 11.</note> out of the anncient Fathers, out of the publike seruire of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitine Church, and out of the custome of the faithfull people. Al which proufes I haue applied to this end: that the body &amp; blood of Christ should be knowen thereby, to be really present in that self Sacrament, which we take into our mouthes. And for so much as that is so, euery faithful man ought to beleue most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly the sayd reall presence: and to detest the contrary doctrine as a most perniciouse heresy.</p>

Therefore the same Fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued those words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> to be true in so wonderfull a maner, as they sound at the first sight. And seing they meane ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their moste vsuall sound, that (this which is pointed vnto (though it seme still bread) is notwithstanding y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> substance of Christes body: we ought to think, that those Fathers beleued the reall presence of Christes body. Otherwise, they wold neuer haue alleged his Godhead, or almightie power and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie for the instituting of a figure and signe of his owne body: sith for the institution of signes and figures such an authoritie<note place="margin">Heb. 3.</note> might haue serued, as God gaue to Moyses: who yet was but the feruant of Iesus Christe, and not almighty God.</p>

               <p>S.

May we not by that meanes go vpward vntil we come to Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or where shal we stay? whether in the ninth hundred yere numbring vpward? how then came that selfe hundred age by this faith?</p>
               <p>If it had it not of the tenth hundred age, it muste make a new faith: aud then it must haue new preachers and Apostles. But what? Did they of the tenth hundred age send any man to preache or no? If they sent none, al the faith must nedes cease at once, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all preaching ceased. But if they sent also preachers, and made Bishops and consecrated Priests, as before tyme had bene vsed (as it can not be denied but they did) I suppose they sent men of their own faith, and not of a contrarie belefe. It they did so, the preachers of the ninth hundred age must nedes preach the same: that they toke of their auncestours, which was the tenth hundred age. And that, which I say of the tenth hundred age, I meane likewise of the eleuenth, and so vpward vntil we come to Christ.</p>
               <p>For in euery age the Bishops, who ruled the Church, sent forth

Thus hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the faith bene preserued from hand to hand, vntill these our daies: in so much that neuer no heresie was begun, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> man was knowen who began it, and much more they were knowen, who impugned the heresy, and defended the truth.

               <p>Thus haue we heard two notable witnesses of the faith of the whole Churche, the one a Latine, S. Hilarius: the other a grecian, Epiphanius.

               <p>At the consecration the Priest in the person of Christ pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth most determinatly ouer bread: This is my body, and ouer wine, This is my bloood.

               <p>Christ said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

We all were agreed, that he was able to make the substance of his body present vnder diuerse formes of bread, and wine. Nowe these wordes affirme, that he will geue a kind of bread: the substance whereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> is his own flesh, euen that flesh, the which he will geue for the life of the world.</p>
               <p>And if we goe to his last supper, we see bread taken, and after blessing and thankes geuen, he said, <hi>This is my body which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for you.</hi> And he gaue his twelue disciples twelue fragme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes

or peeces bidding euery one of them, take, and eate: in which<note place="margin">The dede of Christe</note> deede he sheweth him self to make the substance of his body pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnder the formes of bread in diuerse places at one tyme, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not after the manner of locall situation: because his body hath not in the Sacrament actually that naturall dimention and occupying of place, which it hath otherwise. But as he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined it to be: so is it vnder twelue diuerse formes of bread.</p>
               <p>Here I am sure many will stand with me and say they beleue<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>The confessing of that which Christ said, is a thing that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth vnto faith, because the speaker is God, to whom all faith<note place="margin">Ioan. 14.</note> belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth. To beleue this that God saith, must nedes be a vertue:<note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> and to discredite it, is a great vice. You will perhap allege, that fleshe profiteth nothing, the wordes of Christ are spirit and life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> that is true, &amp; therefore I beleue, that when he said: take, eate this<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> is my body, he gaue his body not without life &amp; spirit: but yet as really, as euer, by saying, <hi>Let the light be made,</hi> he made y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> light. for his wordes be not dead flesh (which profiteth nothing) but quicken and geue lyfe, how, and when so euer it pleaseth hym, muche better: then the spirit and soule of man is able to quicken &amp; make liuely the body wherein it is. These two sayinges, this is my body, and, my wordes are spirit and life, stande so well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb facs="tcp:16931:335"/>
that I beleue the one for the others sake. Christes words neuer lacke spirit and life and power to quicken other thinges, euen as his flesh neuer lacked al kynd of spirit in it selfe: for when the soule was out of it, yet the godhed remayned &amp; corporally<note place="margin">Colos. 2.</note> dwelt in it, and the soule returned to it agayne the third day.</p>
               <p>Therefore when Christ saith, <hi>This is my body which is geuen for you,</hi> I am bound to beleue, that his body is neither without soule, nor godhead: for ells it were not truly said, it is geuen for vs, yf it were not profitable to vs. Thus you se, that I beleue al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> words of Christ together, and that you not doing so, are (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ye do repeut) certeine to be condemned, for not beleuing these words: take, eate, <hi>This is my body.</hi> You wyll say, ye beleue these<note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> words, yet not carnally, but spiritually: as it is mete for Christes wordes to be beleued. O syr, he that assigneth a meane, howe he<note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>wer.</note> will beleue Christes wordes, in that very faut sheweth hym selfe not to beleue them: for belefe inuenteth nothing of his owne, but followeth the autoritie of God that speaketh. I beleue in deed, that Christes words can not be carnal, as you take carnal words for foule and grosse meaninges. But I see it to be a very cleane and pure meaning, that the moste pure substance of the flesh of Christ, should he geuen vnder the form of bread, to thend it may be eaten of vs: and the chiefe and cleanest thing that we vse to eate, is bread. To geue therefore the chiefe and most healthfull flesh in the world, to be eaten vnder the form of the purest eatable thing, is a very pure and cleane work far from all carnality.</p>
               <p>You will say, it is more pure, if it be rather beleued to be eaten<note place="margin">An obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> only of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> harte of man by faith &amp; spirit, then by mouth and body. I answere, that is no pure eating of a corporall thing, which taketh away the truth of corporall eating. Againe both ways<note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</note> of eating are better, then one of them alone. I beleue his real flesh to be eaten with hart and mouth, to be eaten with body &amp; minde,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:16931:335"/>
to be eaten in deede, and in faith. Here faileth your belefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of two true thinges you beleue but one, the other you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit.</p>
               <p>To be short, let vs imagine him that beleueth the real presence of Christes body and blood vnder the formes of bread and wine, to stand before the seate of Christes iudgement, and that Christe asketh him, why he did beleue and worship his body and blood vnder the formes of bread and wine.</p>
               <p>May he not wel answere in this wise? I beleued so and did so,<note place="margin">1.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">The belief of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike.</note> because your maiestie taking bread and hauing blessed, douted not so say, <hi>This is my body:</hi> which words al my forefathers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstode to be spoken properly, and to be true as they sounded: &amp; therefore at the commandement of my prelats I adored your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vnder the form of bread.

                  <p>It is no grosse sort of presence whiche is reall, true, and miraculouse, as being of Christes own institution. Marcion and Apelles (herein your auncestors M. Iuel) thought it a <hi>carnall,</hi> a <hi>grosse, a fleshly</hi> thing for Christ to lie nine moneths in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers belly. to be nourished there with blood and humours. to be borne naked, to be wrapped in clouts. For a remedie of which absurdities, the one of them deuised that Christ was not really borne: but that which Tertullian saith against Marcion shalbe<note place="margin">Tertul. de carne Christi.</note> my answere to you. First God (saieth he) hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound men that are wise (in their own conceit) 2.

Now if we applie all these sayinges to Christes presence in the Sacrament, it shalbe lesse carnall, lesse grosse, lesse fleshly to haue the substance of Christes corporall flesh in a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall manner really present vnder the forme of bread, then either to be corporally in his mothers womb, or to think that he made a lye, when he said: take eate this is my body.</p>

This later kind of signes or figures is vtterly<note place="margin">Bare signes.</note> naked, bare, and without the truth which is signified.</p>
                  <p>The question is, whether of these two kinds of signes is in the Sacrament of Christes supper.

                  <p>Of this place I haue spoken at large in my vi. b. the. i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>. Chapiter, and in my. 3. b. the. xiiij, Chapiter. I will now briefly note the chief points. First M. Iuel doth abuse this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause S. Augustine had sayd before, that Christ gaue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> same flesh to be eaten, wherein he walked, and which he toke of the virgin.
<pb facs="tcp:16931:357"/>
Wherevnto M. Iuel hath no regard at all. Secondly he taught, that it ought to be adored before it was eaten. Thirdly he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it the Sacrament, willing vs to consyder it spiritually. Fourthly he nameth it <hi>quamlibet terram, any earth,</hi> calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>sh of Christ earth. now in saying that we adore any earth, he manisesily declareth that he speaketh of the adoration which is made in diuerse places or altars. Whereas otherwise the flesh o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> Christ in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is but one earth in one place. These things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed (all which are in the place of S. Augustine which M. Iuel now allegeth) it will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>olow that S. Augustine meant, both that Christes flesh is eaten with our bodily mouth in the Sacra ment, and also adored. Therefore when he sayth ye shall not eate this body that you see, he meaneth ye shall not eate it in suche forme as you see it, in such mortall quantitie, or in such a corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible sort. But if it should be meant, ye shall not eate the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of my body (as M. Iuel taketh it) S. Augustines owne words were clean contrarie to them selues for the causes alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before.</p>

                     </gap>oth to haue any commendation past, or any geuing of life to come. For he wold so vnderstand Christes words, that
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:16931:357"/>
the gift &amp; the quickening might be present, lest it should apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyn to the supper: Whereas the commendation of the gift was past, in those words (I wil geue, and the geuing of life to come) verily, because the Sacrament should then geue life when it should be receaued.

But yet that he should be really eaten. Albeit the maner of eating be figu ratiue as we know.

                  <p>Thus it is plaiue that S. Hierome spake not of going into heauen by faith to drink the cup of the new Testament, but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>In these words of S. Augustine it is to be seen euidently, that he putteth a difference betwene the thing, and the Sacrament of that thing. The thing therefore it selfe must be first knowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>In co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration whereof he iustituted a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his own<note place="margin">The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</note> body and blood. Of which body? Of that which he had taken, &amp; which was but one. The first point of this Sacrament must be (saith S.

Therefore the manner that that he speaketh of, is in the Sacrament, in the thing it self, in the substance thereof, and not only in the phrase, or trope, or figure of speache, as M. Iuel would haue it.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the name whiche the Sacrament taketh, is geuen (as S. Augustine saith) according to a likenes, which is betwene the<note place="margin">

That likenes then must be first in the Sacrament really, and afterward (in respect of priority of nature, though not in respect of tyme) the name is geuen. Seing then the likenes of things goeth before the likenes of names:
<pb facs="tcp:16931:375"/>
When S. Augustine saith: the Sacrament of Christes body is the body of Christ according to a certain manner, that manner must respect the likenes of the thinges, before it respecte the likenes of names. Therefore M. Iuel hath erred altogether in translating<note place="margin">False tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation.</note> 
                     <hi>modum,</hi> a phrase or manner of speache. But first he should haue sought wherein the things were like. for in dede the likenes in dinerse things is diuerse: In one thing it is in substance, as God the Father and his sonne are like equall, and one in substance: Yet because there is some difference in that they are diuerse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,<note place="margin">Ioan. 10.</note> the sonne is the figure of his Fathers substance according<note place="margin">Heb. 1.</note> to a certaine manner, to wit, as he is a diuerse person, but not as a diuerse substance. In other things the substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may differ also,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10</note> as the rock and Christe, and the qualitie alone may be like. As when Christ is called the vine, the doore, the way. But to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude<note place="margin">Ioan. 15</note> with this place of S. Augustine, he saith the holy signes whiche are like vnto the truth take also the name of the truth, &amp; he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that rule to shew, that a child baptized maie well be called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> the Sacrament of faith. For saith S. Augustine: <hi>Sacramentum fidei quodammodo fides est.</hi> The Sacrament of faith after a certaine manner is faith. He saith not only it is called faith after a certain phrase of speache (as M.

And iudge you, M. Iuel, that to be only a name &amp; not a truth, which is able to bring the child to saluation? It is faith, and it is not faith, as the Sacrament of the altar is Christes body, and not Christes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the vertue of that power which the Sacrament printeth in the<note place="margin">Habitus fidei.</note> soule of the iufant. it is the habit of faith, and not the act. euen so the Sacrament of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> altar is the substance of Christes body, &amp; not the outward forme thereof, the thing it selfe, and not the shape thereof. The name therefore of faith is geuen to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> child in respect of a truth which by baptism is wrought in the child, although it be not all the truth which is requisite to actuall beleuing. And the Sacrament of Christes supper is called the body of Christe for the substance of the body which is present, although it be not visibly present according to al the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of a true naturall mans bodie.</p>

But when the nounes doe signifie the substance it selfe, the aduerbes deriued of them must nedes draw with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> the signification of the same substance: as <hi>corporalis, carnalis, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantialis,</hi> and <hi>naturalis,</hi> be nounes which signifie a thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the body, the flesh, the substance, the nature of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we speake: and the aduerbes comming of them of necessiti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> must signifie the truth of that nature whereof we intreate.</p>
                  <p>But whether it shall signifie the qualitie also with the truthe: that dependeth of the circumstance of the thing which is in hand. For example: Christe walked corporally vppon the water. that saying must be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, in the truth of a mans body, but not in any such accustomed manner, as other mens bodies are wont to walke vpon the water. For there is no such manner of wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at all. And whereas the aduerbe must be referred wholy to the verbe whose signification it maketh perfite, that saying must be this resolued: Christes bodily walking vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the water, was a<note place="margin">Cyril. ad Theod. de rect. fide. am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulabat mirè vt Deus.</note> true walking concerning the truth of the flesh which did walke: notwithstanding the manner of the walking did excede the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of a mere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>atural body. Thus the aduerbes shall signifie the truth of the substance of a body walking, and yet not the manner of walking belonging to a natural and true body.</p>
                  <p>Euen so when Syrill writeth, that <hi>Christ dwelleth corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

in vs, although he dwell not in vs after suche manner, as other naturall bodies of men dwel in the places where they are. Thus M. Iuel is cast in his grammar also, whereof he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But a substance may be without qualities, as the substance of God is without all manner of accidents.</p>

And yet the old Fathers proued, that as the Sacrament of the altar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted<note place="margin">Cypria. de coena Dom. &amp; de cons. dist. 2. c.</note> of two things, of the signe or foorm of bread, and of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> body of Christ: so Christ consisteth of two natures, the one diuine, the other humane. But seing the Sacramentaries take away y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> reall presence from the visible signe of bread, they falsifie the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<note place="margin">Hoc est quod di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus.</note> of the old Fathers, and further the cause of the Eutichians. For as the Eutichians turned the naturall flesh of Christ into the<note place="margin">Theod. in dialo.</note> Godhead: so the Sacramentaries turn the Sacramental eating of naturall flesh into mere diuine and spirituall eating, which is made by faith alone. But as the old Fathers proued against the Eutichians, that Christ who truly suffered death could not suffer it in his diuine nature: so I tell the Sacramentaries, that Christ who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Clemens Alexandrinus diuiding Christes blood into carnall &amp; spirituall, agreeth with S. Hierom in the former part of the diuision, that is to say, in carnall blood, but in the later part he speaketh of an other thing. For whereas S. Hierom toke spirituall flesh and blood for the substance of them, as they are eaten and dronken in the Sacrament (which thinge may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere, for that he citeth these wdrds of Christ: my flesh is verily meate, and except you eate my flesh, ye shall not haue life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Moreouer when we are vnited by faith &amp; Baptism, we are not vnited vnto faith, or vnto Baptisme, but by them vnto the flesh of Christe.

                  <p>To conclude, S. Chrysostome saith writing vppon S. Iohn,<note place="margin">Hom. 45</note>

                  <p>Against the Arrians Hilarius reasoned thus. 1. Christ is<note place="margin">Pag. 346</note> as really ioyned vnto the Father, as vnto vs. 2. But Christ is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vs by nature. 3. Therefore Christ is ioyned to God the Father by nature.</p>

                  <p>In dede S. Hilarie maketh such an argument. But how<note place="margin">8.</note> doth he proue, that Christ is ioyned vnto vs by nature?</p>

                  <speaker>Iu.</speaker>
                  <p>He proueth it thus: We are ioyned vnto Christ by faith, that<note place="margin">9.</note> is, by the nature of one faith, and that is to say, naturally.</p>

                  <p>If euer anie man spake ignorantly, falsely, impudently:<note place="margin">10.</note> this man is giltie thereof at this tyme. Note, I beseche you, the number of faults committed by him.</p>
                  <p>First he maketh S. Hilarie to bring such kind of proofe, as<note place="margin">11.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">The 159. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ntruthe.</note> he doth not bring for proofe of that proposition, which M. Iuell hath set foorth. For S. Hilarie did bring that, which is said of the nature of faith, to answere the argument taken out of the Actes<note place="margin">Actor. 4.</note> of the Apostles, which I now haue proponed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, M. Iuel omitted the true and only argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which<note place="margin">12.</note> S. Hilarie bringeth in dede to proue, that Christ is ioyned vnto<note place="margin">The 160 vntruthe.</note> vs by nature. The which proof of his I will hereafter prosecute at large.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, M. Iuel doth make S. Hilarie a verie foole in the<note place="margin">13.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">The 161. vntruthe.</note> kind of proof which M. Iuel assigneth him. For whereas by M. Iuels consession he should haue proued, that Christe is ioyned vnto vs by nature: M. Iuel maketh him to saie, that we are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto Christ by faith, and so that we are naturally ioyned to him. Where is your memorie, M. Iuell? It is to be proued, that Christ is ioyned to vs, and not only that we are ioyned to him.
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:16931:411"/>
And that he is ioyned to vs by his nature, and not only that we are ioyned to him by a nature of faith, whiche is not in him. For Christ hath no faith, because from the instant of his incarnation<note place="margin">Christ had not faith but more then faith.</note> his soule and vnderstanding was illuminated with the vision of God, to whose nature it was ioyned in one person. and where clere vision is, there is no faith: in so much that faith shal cease when we come to see God in his glorie. And how is Christ ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13</note> to vs by that faith, which he hath not at all?</p>
                  <p>Fourthlie M, Iuel ouerthroweth wholie the true argument<note place="margin">14.</note> of S. Hilarie, whose intent is onlie as yet to shew, that faythfull<note place="margin">The 162. vntrut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>.</note> men are one among themselfes by the nature of faith also, and not onlie by wil and consent, as I haue declared before. He spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth I say, of our ioyning one to an other, &amp; not as yet of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes ioyning to vs, or of ours to Christ.</p>
                  <p>Fifthlie M. Iuel falsifieth the words of S. Hilarie. for he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth<note place="margin">15.</note> 
                     <note place="margin">The 163. vntruth. Falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</note> him to say, that we are ioyned to Christ by faith <hi>naturaliter,</hi> naturally. &amp; he writeth that word in such letters, as he is wont to write the words of the fathers in. But S. Hilarie saith not, nor neuer mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that we are ioyned to Christ by faith naturally. Ther is no such word in him. What honest nature thoughe heretofore<note place="margin">16.</note> he did beleue M. Iuel, will now any longer stick vnto him, sith he is found to be without al wit or conscience? Trulie Simon Magus was no more filthie in his iuggling knaks, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this man is. But let vs goe forward in S. Hilarie.</p>
                  <p>The second answer of S. Hilarie to the first arg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ment of the<note place="margin">17.</note> Arrians is, that the Christians are one also by the nature of one baptism, and not by Will onlie.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Iuel.</speaker>
                  <p>Likewise he saith, we are ioyned vnto Christ by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation<note place="margin">18.</note> of one nature. and againe: we are ioyned to Christ by the nature of one baptism. hereof he concludeth: therefore are we naturally ioyned vnto him.</p>

                  <p>In so few words it is hard for a man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>udued with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to make so many faultes, as M. Iuel hath now committed.</p>
                  <p>First he wil make S. Hilarie proue, that Christ is ioyned vnto<note place="margin">19.</note> vs by nature, because we are ioyned to him by regeneration of<note place="margin">The 164 vntruthe.</note> one nature: Which argument will not hold. for it will not follow y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> because we are ioyned to an other by some inferiour meanes, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he therefore is ioyned to vs by a higher meane. To be ioyned to<note place="margin">20.</note> vs in nature is a higher thing, then for vs to be ioyned to Christ in Baptism. How can then the baser coniunction infer of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie a higher kind of ioyning?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, M. Iuel doth falsifie S. Hilaries wordes, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">21.</note> that he sayth we are ioyned to Christ by the nature of one Baptism. S. Hilarie saith it not, but only that all the Christians are one among them selues by these things, and not one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with Christ. His own words are: Whereas in so great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of nations, of conditions, of sexes (the faithfull) are one,<note place="margin">Lib. 8. de Trinit.</note> cometh it of the assent of will, or rather of the vnitie of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, because both Baptism is one vnto them, and all they haue put on them one Christ? Therefore what shall the concord of minds doe here, for as much as they are one thereby, because they are clothed with one Christ by the nature of one Baptism?<note place="margin">22.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is most impudently affirmed of M. Iuel, that S.<note place="margin">The 166. vntruthe.</note> Hilarie concludeth hereof: therefore we are naturally ioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ. S. Hilarie hath no such conclusion, neither could he haue any such, because it is not yet his purpose to open, how Christ is ioyned vnto vs by nature.</p>
                  <p>You wil say, is it not then true, that we are ioyned to Christ<note place="margin">Note well.</note> by faith and by Baptism? Yeas Syr, and by will also. But note the point we stand vpon: we are not ioyned naturally to Christ, nor he is not ioyned by nature vnto vs by our faith or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.<note place="margin">Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> It is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> term naturally, which M.

crosse, and that te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>n D. Harding hath found to appertein to the Sacrament, as it shalbe be made most manifest. That term M. Iuel wold wrest to faith and Baptism. And for that termes sake he is almost become a wicked Arrian, or a naturall.</p>
                  <p>The second argument of the Arrians, is: He that planteth, &amp;<note place="margin">23.</note> he that watereth are one. Ergo, sayd they, the vnitie of will is in both them: and they meant of will only, and not any other vnitie.</p>
                  <p>S. Hilarie answereth, that they are one, because to them being<note place="margin">24.</note> born again in one Baptism, one ministerie or dispensation of the one Baptism, which doth regenera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e, is graunted. So that they are on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, because they haue one ministerie, and not only because they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> of one minde.</p>
                  <p>At the last S. Hilarie geueth a generall rule: <hi>qui per eandem<note place="margin">25.</note> rem vnum sunt, naturâ etiam vnum sunt, non tantum voluntate.</hi> Those who are o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e by the same thing, they are one by nature, and not only by will.</p>
                  <p>The third argument of the Arrians, is: <hi>Exemplum vnitatis<note place="margin">26.</note> istius</hi> (sayth S. Hilarie) <hi>&amp; caet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Arrians haue brought foorth an example of this vnitie<note place="margin">Ioan. 17.</note> out of our Lords words also, to th'end all may be one: As thou O Father in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in vs.</p>
                  <p>To this argument S. Hilarie answereth, declaring now first<note place="margin">27.</note> that, which M. Iuel spake of before out of place. Now first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth S. Hilarie to shew, how Christ dwelleth naturally in vs, and we in him. And consequently, how we also dwell in his Father by the meane of him.</p>
                  <p>To this matter should M. Iuel haue applied his solutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For vppon the discourse made by reason of this argument, D. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding did ground his proof of Christes reall presence in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. What saith M. Iuel to this matter?</p>

                  <p>Thus it appeareth by S.

                  <speaker>Iuel.</speaker>
                  <p>Like as Christ is naturally, corporally, and carnally in<note place="margin">the 168. vntruthe.</note> vs, by faith, by regeneration, and by Baptism: euen so and none otherwise, he is in vs by the Sacrament of his body.</p>

                  <p>First you begin with a thing not confessed, nor agre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But by the Sacrament of his body he is both in vs, and in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the true and corporal substance of his own flesh &amp; blood.</p>
                  <p>Secondly you distinguish regeneration from Baptism, as<note place="margin">The 169. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Out of whiche place it appereth, that as the substance of God the Father is really in the person of Christ: so S. Hilary meant, that Christes naturall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance by meane of the Sacrament receaued, is within our own persons. For the naturall being of Christ through the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in vs, is the meane to proue, that God the Father is naturally in Christ. But if Christe through the Sacrament were in vs as only eaten by faith, God the Father should be proued to be in his sonne by faith only, and not by nature. whiche thing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians would haue concluded, whom M.

<pb facs="tcp:16931:426"/>
proposition that you haue framed in his name, is not in him, but although it were in him, yet it is not to the purpose. For it is one thing to be made of the flesh of Christ, whiche maie be meant of his mystical flesh, and an other thing to partake his fleshe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. We are made of his flesh by spiritual meanes. For to be of his flesh it is to belong to his flesh, that is to say, to be members therof by any meane at al.

For Christ can not be better present in spirit and grace, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he be present in his flesh, therein to conuerte to vs his spirit and grace. for the cause of his taking flesh was, to make his flesh an instrument to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his spirit and grace to our flesh, to thend no meane of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for our saluation might be omitted by so louing a Father.
