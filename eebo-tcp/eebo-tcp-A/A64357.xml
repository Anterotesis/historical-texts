            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note>Satisfaction in this Inquiry is of great Moment. For it relateth to our great end, and to the way which leads to it. And it nearly concerneth both the <hi>Romanists</hi> and the <hi>Reformed.</hi> If there be not such a <hi>Guide,</hi> the Estate of the <hi>Romanists</hi> is extreamly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. For then the Blind take the Blind for their unerring Leaders; and being once misled, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on without correcting their Error, having taken up this first as their fixed Principle, that their <hi>Guide</hi> cannot mistake the way. On the other hand, If God hath set up in his Church a Light so very clear and steddy as is pretended; the <hi>Reformed</hi> are guilty of great presumption, and expose themselves to great uncertainty, by shutting their Eyes against it.</p>

               </note>Now, there lyes before Men a double Temptation to a belief of the being of such a Guide in the Christian Church; <hi>Sloth</hi> and Vitious <hi>Humility</hi> of Mind. <hi>Sloth</hi> inclineth Men rather to take up in an Implicit Faith, than to give themselves the trouble of a strict Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of things. For there is less Pain in Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, then in bending of the Head by long and strict Attention and severe Study.</p>
            <p>Also there is a Shew of Humility, in the deference which our understandings pay unto Authority; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to that which pretends to be, under Christ, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme on Earth.

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105906:5"/>
of it. Such will resolve the Question in the Affirmative; and they may reasonably so do by considering these Propositions which I shall treat of in their order.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Christian Church never yet wanted, nor shall it ever want, either the Doctrines of necessary Faith, or the Belief and Profession of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Wheresoever God requireth the Belief of them, he giveth means sufficient for Information and unerring Assent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whatsoever those means are, every Man's Personal reason giveth to the Mind that last Weight which turneth Deliberation into Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The means which God hath given us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards necessary Faith and the certainty of it, is not the Authority of any Infallible Guide on Earth.</p>
            <p>Yet, <hi>Fifthly,</hi> All Ecclesiastical Guidance is not to be rejected, in our pursuance of the Doctrines of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, in the finding out or stating of which it is a very considerable help.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> By the help of it, and Principally as it offers to us the Holy Scriptures in the Quality of the Rule of Faith, we have means sufficient to lead us to certainty in that Belief which is necessary to Life Eternal.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prop. I.</hi>
               </note> The Acknowledgment and Profession of the necessary Doctrines of the Christian Faith, are annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inseparably to the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>There is but <hi>one Faith</hi>; and according to the saying of <hi>Leo</hi> the great <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Nisi una est Fides, non est. L.M.Ser.</hi> 23.</note>, If <hi>it be not one, it is not at all:</hi> For it cannot be contrary to it self. And though it be but <hi>one,</hi> yet Men of differing <hi>Creeds</hi> pretend to it, as the


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105906:6"/>
Merchants of <hi>Relicks</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> shew, in several places, the <hi>one seamless Coat</hi> of Christ <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>See Ferrand. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>disquis. Relig.</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>This one Faith never did, nor ever shall in all places fail.</p>
            <p>The Apostles were themselves without error both in their own assent to the Fundamentals of the Christian Faith, and in the delivery of them.</p>
            <p>They heard the Oracles of Christ from his own mouth, and they were Witnesses of his Resurrection; And they spake <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19, 20.</note> what they <hi>had seen</hi> and <hi>heard.</hi> And they gave to the World Assurance of the Truth, by the miraculous signs of their Apostolical Office. And if they had not had such Assurance themselves, and could not have given proof to others of their mission, there would have been a defect in the first promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gospel; and such as could not afterwards have been amended. That which, at first, had been delivered with uncertainty, would, with greater un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, have been conveighed down to after Ages; and Men, who, in process of time, graft error upon certain Truth, would much more have grafted error upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Opinion.</p>
            <p>Ever since the Apostles times there has been True Faith, and the Profession of it in the Catholick Church: And it will be so till Faith shall expire, and Men shall see him on whom they before believ'd. For a Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not subsist without the Fundamentals of Christianity. And Christ hath Sealed this Truth with his promise, that there shall be a Church as long as this World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Mat.</hi> 28.20.</note> I mean by a Church a visible Society of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans both Ministers and People; for publick Worship on Earth cannot be invisible.</p>
            <p>But the True Faith and the Profession of it is not fixed to any place, or to any succession of Men in it.


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105906:6"/>
God's Providence has written the contrary in the very Ashes of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> of the lesser <hi>Asia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is any particular Church, though so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in Fundamentals as to be preserved from actual error, an infallible Rule to all other Christians. If they follow the Doctrine of it, they err not, because it is true; but if they follow that Church as an uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Guide or Canon, they mistake in the Rule and Motive of their Faith. For that particular Church which Teacheth Truth, might possibly have err'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Church which errs, might have shined with the True Light. But the whole Church cannot so err in any Age; for then the very being of a Church would cease.</p>
            <p>Neither doth it, hence, follow, that the Faith of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, when <hi>Luther</hi> arose, was the only true and certain Doctrine. For that Church was not then the only visible Church on Earth. The <hi>Greek</hi> Church (for instance sake) was than more visible than now it is, and more Orthodox: The Rich Papacy having much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon the necessities of it by Arguments guilded with Interest. That Church did not err in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Points; the Article of the <hi>Procession of the Holy Ghost</hi> from the Father by the Son, which the <hi>Romans</hi> accuse of Heresie, being easily acquitted of it, if Men, agreeing in the sense, forbear contention about the Phrases. Besides; if our Fore-Fathers under the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy embraced the True Faith, we have it still; the <hi>Faith</hi> not being removed, but the <hi>Corruption.</hi> Their Question therefore [<hi>Where was your Religion before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>] is not more pertinent amongst Disputers than this is amongst Husbandmen, [<hi>Where was the Corn before it was weeded?</hi>]</p>
            <p>We have seen that necessary Faith is perpetual,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prop. II.</hi>
               </note> and


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105906:7"/>
it is as manifest that <hi>wheresoever God requireth the belief of it, he vouchsafeth sufficient means for information, and unerring Assent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all he does not require this belief, for to all the Gospel is not preached, and where it is preached there are Infants, and Persons of Age so distempered in Mind, as to remain unavoidably Children in understanding.</p>
            <p>And though the same Sum of Doctrines is generally necessary to Salvation, yet the Creed of all Men is not of equal length, seeing they have unequal capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.</p>
            <p>But wheresoever there is a particular Society of Men, who call themselves a Church, yet err actually in the necessary Articles of the Faith, it is certain they were not forced into that error for want of external means. For the Just Judge of the World would never have required Unity in the Faith upon pain of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal displeasure, if he had not given to Men Power sufficient for such Unity. No Tyrant on Earth has been guilty of such undisguised injustice as that is, which maketh a Law for the punishment of the Blind because they miss their way.

               </gap>cles of Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on come not to the Mind by natural reason but by Faith; and Faith comes by hearing or reading; and where these means are not offered, a Man is rather an Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Person than an Unbeliever.

               </note>) <hi>Men must and will be Judges for themselves.</hi> I do not quote the saying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is extraordinary, but because that Learned Man said it who was careful to pay to Authority its minutest dues. If a Man believes upon Authority, he hath a further reason for the believing of it. He is not willing to take Pains in examining that which is proposed to him; or he thinks himself of less A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in understanding than those from whom he borrows his Light. If he desireth another to judge for him, his choice is determined by the Opinion he hath conceived of him. Every Man has his reason, though it be a weak one, and such as cannot justify it self or him. Something at last turns the Ballance, though it be but a Feather.</p>
            <p>This the <hi>Romanists</hi> own as well as the Reformed, till it toucheth them in the case of a new Convert. To induce a Man of another particular Church to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace their Communion, they submit these weighty points to his private Judgment: What is a True Church, and which are the marks of it? What is the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? And whether the marks of the True Church do only belong unto the <hi>Roman?</hi> What Men or what Books speak the sense of that Church?

               </q> As if it were not as difficult to judge of such a Guide, as of his direction.</p>
            <p>It seems, the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is like a Cave, into which a Man has Light enough to enter; but when once he is entred, he is in thick Darkness.</p>

               </note>But, how subservient soever our reason may be to our Faith; <hi>The means which God hath given us towards the certain attaining of it, is not the Authority of any infallible Guide on Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This will not be disbelieved by those who weigh well the following considerations.</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> God did not set up such a constant, infallible Guide among the <hi>Jews</hi>; though, at first, he gave Assurance to them by Miracle, that <hi>Moses</hi> had received his Commission from him, and had brought to them the <hi>Tables</hi> which he had Written, for their direction, with his own finger.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is true, the <hi>Israelites</hi> were, by God, directed in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult cases to an Assembly of Judges <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8. <hi>to</hi> 12.</note>. But they were not Judges of controversies in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> but in <hi>Property.</hi> To their sentence the People were to submit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>See Levit.</hi> 4.13.</note> as to an expedient for Peace; though Judgment might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or mistaken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:105906:8"/>It must be, also, confessed that God spake to them by the <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>Vrim,</hi> and that the voice of it was infallible. But its answers concerned not the necessary Rudiments of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> Law, but emergencies in their civil affairs; those especially of Peace and War.</p>
            <p>But if we admit that there was under <hi>Judaism</hi> a living infallible Guide; it does not, thence, follow, that it must be so under Christianity. For their small precinct (the People of which were thrice in a year to come up to the Temple) was much more capable of such a judge than the Christian Church, which is as wide as the World. Also the new Revelation is more clear and distinct than the old one was, and stands not in such need of an Interpreter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Consid. II.</hi>
               </note> God hath, no where, <hi>promised Christians</hi> such a <hi>judge:</hi> He hath no where <hi>said</hi> that he <hi>hath</hi> given such a one to the Christian Church. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such a one cannot be had without Gods superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural assistance, the most knowing amongst Men being subject both to Error and to Falshood; it is great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, whilst the Scripture is silent, to say he is in being. And to affirm that if there were not such a Guide, God would be wanting in means sufficient for the maintenance of Peace and Truth, is presumptuously to obtrude the schemes of Mans fancy upon God's Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. He can Govern his Church without our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods.</p>
            <p>Now, God <hi>hath no where promised such a judge to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Men</hi>; though he hath promised help on Earth, and assistance from Heaven to Men diligent and sincere in their inquiries after Truths which are necessary for them.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>two places</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> which are by some taken for <hi>Promises</hi> of such a nature, though they were not, by the Divine Wisdom, so intended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105906:9"/>Of these, the <hi>First</hi> is that which was spoken by Christ unto St. <hi>Peter.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Mat.</hi> 16.18.</note> 
               <hi>The Gates of Hell shall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against</hi> (the Church.) Which Promise concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Church in general, and the necessary Faith of it, and not any particular persons, or places, or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of persons in them.</p>
            <p>And Christ doth here assure us, that <hi>the Gates of the Grave</hi> shall not swallow up the Church; that it shall not enter in at them; <hi>that it shall not die or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi> But he doth not say he will preserve it by the means of any Earthly Infallible Guide. He can, by other ways, continue it till time it self shall fail.</p>
            <p>The <hi>other</hi> place of <hi>Scripture</hi> is, the promise of Christ a little while before his Ascension into the Heavens. <note n="†" place="margin">

But it is a promise of general assistance; and it is made upon condition that they go forth and make Disciples of all Men of all Nations, and Baptize them, and give them further instruction in the things which Christ gave in charge to them. And some of the successors of the Apostles have not performed these conditions; and the Governour of the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> had not held fast what he had <hi>received</hi> and <hi>heard.</hi>

            <p>As God hath not <hi>promised</hi> an unerring Guide, so neither hath he <hi>said</hi> he hath set up such an one in any Church on Earth.</p>
            <p>He hath not said it, either <hi>directly,</hi> or by <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>places</hi> which are supposed <hi>directly</hi> to affirm this, are two, and both mistaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One</hi> of them is that of Christ to his Disciples, after he had given Commission to them to preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

            <p>It is true, there are some among us, though not of us, who, with disdainful insolence, contemn all Authority; even that of the Sacred Scripture it self.

            <p>I will hasten to the next Proposition, after I have added one thing more which relates to the guidance of Ecclesiastical Authority: And it is this. Those of the Unlearned Laity who are Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have much more of the just guidance of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Authority than the like order of Men in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For the Authentick Books of that Church being all written in the Latin Tongue, the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate People resolve their Faith into the ability and honesty of their Confessor or Parish Priest. They take it upon his word, that this is the Doctrine, this the Discipline, this the Worship, of their Church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as each Minister in our Church can direct the People to the Holy Bible, to the Books of Homilies, Articles, Canons, Common-Prayer, Ordination, as set forth in their native Tongue, by publick Authority. Of this they may be assured by their own Eyes, as many as can but competently read. They do not only take this from the mouth of a Priest, but from the Church it self. Where the Laws of the Church and the Statutes of the Civil Government are written in an unknown Tongue, there the Unlearned depend more upon private than publick Authority; for they receive the Law from particular Priests or Judges.</p>

               </note>Though Ecclesiastical Authority be a help to our Faith, yet the Holy Scripture is the only infallible Rule of it; and by this Rule and the Ministerial Aids of the Christian Church, we have sufficient means without

Submission to papal. Infallibility, to attain to certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that Faith which is generally necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>I do not mean that, by believing the whole Canon of the Scripture in the gross, we thereby believe all the necessary Articles of the Faith, because they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained. That looks too like a fallacy; and it giveth countenance to an useless Faith. For he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves on this manner, hath as it were swallow'd a Creed in the lump only, whereas it is necessary for a Christian to know each particular Article and the general Nature and Tendency of it. Otherwise his Faith will not have a distinct influence upon his Christian behaviour to which if it were not useful, it were not necessary. To believe in general as the Scripture believes, is with the Blind and Flexible Faith of a <hi>Romanist,</hi> to believe at adventure. He believes as his Church believes, but he knows not what is the belief of his Church; and therefore is not instructed by that Faith to behave himself as a Member of it.</p>
            <p>The Scripture is that rule of Faith which giveth us all the particular Articles which are necessary to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</p>

               <hi>First,</hi> a Protestant without the submission of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, may be certainly directed to the Canonical Books of Holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:105906:21"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He may without such submission, sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand the Rule of Faith, and find out the Sense of such places in those Canonical Books, as is necessary to the belief of a true Christian.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This rule of Faith is the principal means of Union in Faith in the Christian Church.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Assert. I.</hi>
               </note>First, a <hi>Protestant</hi> without the submission of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church may be certainly directed to the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>It is commonly said by Men of the <hi>Roman</hi> perswasion, but injudiciously enough, that we may as well receive our Creed from them, as we do our Bible. The <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> might have said the like to the People of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But with the good Text, they conveighed down to them a very false gloss, and misinterpreted the Prophesies, as meant of a pompous temporal <hi>Messiah.</hi> But, for the Reformed, they have received neither Creed nor Bible from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The first enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Books they find in the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Canons, and in those of the Council of <hi>Laodicea</hi>; no <hi>Western</hi> writings. They have received the Scriptures from the Universal Church of all Ages and Places, the Copies of them having been as widely dispersed as the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans themselves. And they receive them not from the infallibility of any particular Church, but upon the validity of this sure principle, that all the Christian World, so widely dispersed, could not possibly conspire in the imposing of false Books upon them.</p>
            <p>For particular Churches, we may, of all others sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the <hi>Roman,</hi> in reference to the Scriptures. For what sincerity of dealing may we hope for from such a Cabal of Men as has forged decrees of Councils and Popes, obtruded upon the World Apocryphal Books as Books Canonical, purged out of the writings of the Fathers such places as were contrary to their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105906:21"/>
depressed the Originals under an imperfect Latin Copy, and left on purpose in that Copy, some places uncorrected for the serving of turns. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample sake, they have not either in the Bible of <hi>Sixtus,</hi> or in that of <hi>Clement</hi> (both which, though in War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst each other, are made their Canon) changed the word [<hi>She</hi>] in the third of <hi>Genesis,</hi>

The <hi>English</hi> Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Doway</hi> hath followed this plain and partial corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Assert. II.</hi>
               </note> A Protestant may without Submission of his judgment to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, find out, in the Books of Holy Scripture, the necessary Articles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Two things</hi> are here supposed; and both of them are true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That the Scriptures contain in them all the necessary Articles of our Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the sense of the Words in which these Articles are expressed in Scripture may be found out by a Protestant, without the Submission of his judgment to the Papacy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Scriptures contain in them all the necessary Articles of the Faith. This is true, if the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be so: For this they Witness <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>See S. Joh.</hi> 20.30, 31. <hi>C.</hi> 21.25.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi>

That there are in it the Articles of the Apostolical Creed, is evident enough to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reader. But how the <hi>Romish</hi> Articles should be found in that Bible which was written some hundreds of years before they were invented, is a riddle beyond the skill of <hi>Apollo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the sense of the Scriptures, in matters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation, may be found out by Men of the Reformed Religion, without Submission to <hi>Roman</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility. The <hi>Learned</hi> know the Originals, and the true ways of Interpretation. And amongst us, those of the Episcopal Clergy have obliged the World with such an Edition of the Bible in many Languages as was not before extant in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And a <hi>Romanist</hi> who writes with great mastery in such matters, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it before the great Bible of <hi>Paris</hi>

            <p>For those of the Laity who are Unlearned, they have before them a <hi>Translation</hi> which errs not in the Faith. And the phrases are not so obscure, but that, by study and Ministerial helps, they may understand them.</p>
            <p>They have, before them, a Translation which errs not in the Faith.

their Translation with that of <hi>Doway.</hi> In all of them they will find the same Fundamental Doctrines of Faith.

But the former are not able to produce one instance; and the latter agree with us in the use and excellence of the Translation, though in other things, they extreamly differ from us: And where they do but dream we err they forbear not to proclaim it. In so much that a difference in the Translations of the Psalter which concerns not Faith or Manners <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <hi>Histoire Critique.

But, it seems, he was not exact enough in this change of words. For he having over-looked some words which were used by the <hi>Genevians</hi> and not the <hi>Romanists,</hi> a discovery was made by the Divines of <hi>Paris,</hi> and this Edition of the Bible was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by them, though published under the name of one of their Brethren.</p>
            <p>I do not say that such places of Scripture as contain Matters of Faith, are plain to every Man. But those who have a competence of capacity, who are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced against the Truth, who pray to God for his assistance, who attend to what they read, who use the Ministerial helps which are offered to them, shall find enough in Holy Writ to Guide them to everlasting life. In finding out the sense of the Scriptures, the Church gives them help, but it does not, by its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, obtrude the sense upon them. The Guides of it are as Expositors and School-Masters to them: And by comparing phrase with phrase, and place with place, and by other such ways, they teach them how to judge of the meaning themselves. They give them


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:105906:23"/>
light into the nature of the Doctrine, they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to take it upon trust. They endeavour to open their understandings that they may, themselves, understand the Scriptures. And if they cannot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves understand the Doctrine, it will be of little use to them in their lives. For they then believe in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral that it is a necessary Truth; but what Truth it is or for what ends it is necessary, they apprehend not. A Foolish Master in the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire his Schollars to take it upon his word that a Problem is demonstrated: But a wise and useful teacher will give them light into the manner of the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in such sort, that they themselves shall at last be able to judge that it is truly performed: And till they can do this, they are not instructed. St. <hi>Hierom</hi> relates it in praise of <hi>Marcella</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Lady <note n="(a,)" place="margin">
                  <hi>S. Hieron. in prf. ad Comment. in Epist. ad Galat. — Vt sentirem me non tam Discipulam ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere quam ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicem. v.

            <p>It is certain that there are great depths and obscure Mysteries in the Holy Bible. But the Doctrines of Christian Faith are, to the sincere and industrious and such as wait on God in the way of the Reformed Church, sufficiently plain. But to the Idle, the prejudiced, the captious, Light it self is Darkness.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romanists</hi> affright with this pretence of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity and profoundness; as if we must not adventure into any part of the Waters, because in some places, we may go beyond our depth. If there are hard and difficult places which the <hi>Vnstable wrest</hi>; who required their meanness to make a judgment of that for which they might perceive themselves to be insufficient? But whilst St. <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh of some few places in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s writings which are obscure, he does, at the same time,


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:105906:24"/>
suppose many others to be plain enough for the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of the Unlearned. And if they be evil Men, though very Learned, they will wrest the plainest places; and (as some did in St. <hi>Hieroms</hi>

               </note> days) they will draw violently to their private sense a Text of Scripture which is incongruously, and with relectance applied to it.</p>
            <p>It is true all Sects of Christians cite the Scriptures; but that does not prove the obscurity of those Sacred writings: It rather shews the Partiality, Boldness, and Sophistry of those who alledge them. All Laws are obscure if this Argument hath force in it. For every Man, in his own case, has the Law on his side. Men take up their opinions and Heresies from other reasons; and then, because the name of Scripture is venerable, they rake into the several Books of it, and they bend and torture places, and force them on their side by unnatural construction. So do the <hi>Socinians,</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all the niceties of Grammar and Criticism in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Faith. Yet the Guide in Controversies <note n="(a)" place="margin">

               </note> useth it as an Argument against the plainness of this Rule of Faith, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> cite the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in favour of their Heresie. But is not this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument two-edged? And will it not cut as well on the other side, and do Execution against the words, of Fathers and Councils, and the Apostolical Creed it self? For the <hi>Socinians</hi> (those especially who are turned <hi>Arians</hi>) since <hi>Petavius</hi> hath furnished them with Quotations, will cite the writings of the Ancients: And <hi>Slichtingius,</hi> a mere <hi>Socinian,</hi>

            <p>But, if the Scriptures were so obscure in necessary matters, what remedy would be administred by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? They cannot offer to us any Ancient;

infallible exposition. What the Antients have said, the Reformed generally understand much better then Popes, amongst whom there have been some who could scarce read the Holy Gospel in Latin. For the Fathers of the earliest Ages, they were more busied in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against Heresies, then in explaining of Scriptures. Nor, to this day hath the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, given any Authentick Collection of Expositions, either of the Ancients or of her own. And if we must go to any Church for a comment on the Scriptures, let the <hi>Roman</hi> be one of our last Refuges. For it is manifest that the Key the Papalins use, is the Worldly Polity of that Church. And as they like, so they interpret. Had not they governed themselves by this art, we should not have found in the writings of their Popes, and in the very Canon Law it self, those words which were spoken to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> expounded of the Supremacy of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>

               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:105906:25"/>No expositions are more besides the sense of the Text, or more ridiculous, then some of those which may be found in the Authentick Books of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. And those who composed them appear to have looked asquint on the Scriptures. For whilst they looked on them, they seem to have looked another way. I will instance only in a few of those many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd expositions, with which the <hi>Roman Breviary</hi> abounds.</p>
            <p>The words of the Angel to the Holy Virgin [a Sword shall go through thine own Soul also] are <note n="(a)" place="margin">

And this sense is designed as an evasion of their reasoning, who from that Text, conclude concerning the blessed Virgin, that she died, and was not miraculously assumed. The Ascension of <hi>Elias</hi> is thus expounded. <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Dom. infrâ Oct. Asc. in</hi> 3. <hi>Noct. p.</hi> 443.</note> 
               <q>He was taken up into the aerial, not the aetherial, Heavens; from whence he was dropped in an obscure place on Earth, there to remain to the end of the World, and then to expire with it.</q> They say <note n="†" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>We may perceive, by these few Instances, what an entrance into the sense of Scripture is like to be given, whilst a Pope has the Key of Knowledge in his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Whilst the <hi>Romanists</hi> ascribe the differences which arise amongst the <hi>Reformed</hi> to their want of an infallible Guide, and to their different interpretations of the Scriptures, they unskilfully derive effects from causes which are not the natural Parents of them. There is (saith St. <hi>Austine</hi>) one Mother of all strifes, and she is <hi>Pride.</hi> Neither doth the Scripture divide us, nor does the infallibility of their judge unite them. Their Union (such as it is) ariseth from the mighty force of their External Polity; and they speak not different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because they dare not; and the strength of that Polity arose at first from <hi>Rome,</hi> not as the Chair of St. <hi>Peter</hi> but as the Seat of the Empire. Our divisions like theirs, arise (as all Wars do, be they Ecclesiastical or Civil) from the unruly Lusts and Passions of Men. And from these likewise, arise generally the misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of plain Laws, and Rules; the sense of which must be made to chime according to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of prejudiced Men, or else they will not give at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to them. If the Lusts and Passions of Men were mortified; all Christians agreeing in the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scriptures, though not of any Living Guide; and the words of the one being as intelligible as those of the other: All might agree in one Creed, and put an end to those unnecessary Controversies which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle Truth, and extinguish Charity.</p>
