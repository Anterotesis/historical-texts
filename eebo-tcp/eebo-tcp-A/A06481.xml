            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the most merciful and prudent Princesse, <hi>Elyzabeth,</hi> by the grace of God, of Englande, Fraunce, and Ireland Queene, Defender of the faith, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S heretofore (my moste gratious Soueraigne) I troubled your Highnesse (not without some trauell to my selfe) in a thing that was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, reasonable, and commodious to many, and hurte to none: Euen so I haue now (not troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but louingly) framed an earnest persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to suche of your subiects, as feare not God as they ought, regarde not hys worde as they shoulde, nor obey your Highnesse as they are bounde, naming them Englishe enimies (as I maye verye well) for Englishe friendes I am sure they are not: whych per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion is necessarie, reasonable, and very profitable for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; not hurtfull to any. And as that which beefore I made to your Maiestie, was by your Grace onely to be aucthorized, for the greate releefe and succour of youre subiectes: So this that I haue nowe written to your subiectes, is to bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and practised by them, to the great comfort and ioy (I hope) of your Highnesse. And though I haue penned it for them to performe: yet I haue dedicated it to your Grace to peruse. Beseeching youre Maiestie therein to pardon my boldenesse (or rather presumption) for thoughe it bee not so learnedly, so cunningly, and so finely framed, as is requisite for your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie: yet it is so plainly, so truly, and so zealously done, as is meete for your subiects. Not doubting, but stedfastlye trusting, though al thereby be not allured from their errour, that many will be wonne to the truth: though it make not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> see, that wincke for the nonce, it wil cause the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to see, that wil open their eyes. And though it procure not the obstinate and determined Papistes, from being Englishe Enimies: yet it will enforce thousandes (I hope) of the simple seduced sorte, to become Englishe friendes (or rather friendes to <hi>England.</hi>) And thoughe there might seeme in mee, too muche boldenesse, to craue of your Maiestie, to reade this presently: yet I beseech your Highnesse to view and peruse it at your leysure conueniently. For as the reading thereof, I truste wil much profite them, to whom I haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it: so your Graces reading of it, woulde not a little reioyce mee, to whome I dedicate it. And whereas I firmely beleeue, that God thereby wil be better honoured, the Gospel more embraced, Papistrie more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, your Maiestie better obeyed, your Highnesse of manye more lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, your power more augmented, treason lesse practised, forraine foes more discouraged, your louing subiects more comforted, Englishe eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies more diminished, Englishe friendes more encreased, and this youre
<pb facs="tcp:9415:3"/>
Realme of <hi>England</hi> the better strengthned: yet the onely thing that I craue therefore of your Grace, is, well to accept it, and in good parte to take it, Beseeching your Maiestie not to respect the meane estate of the person, but the meaning of the partie, not the cunning of the contriuer, but the intent of the writer, neither howe it is couched, but to what ende it is framed. And if there be any thing therein that shall mislike your Maiestie, I most humbly beseech you therefore to pardon me, protesting to God and your Grace, that I wrote the same, not purposely, but negligently: and not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, but ignorantly: Hoping besides, that the godly and wise will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue all things therein to the beste, and not wreast them to the worst. And as for other, that haue an ouerweening in their owne wittes, and that are rather curious carpers, than profitable doers, (whereof there are not a few) I doe not muche weigh, for it is impossible to write so circumspectly, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie or please euery precise head. And therefore I haue chosen rather to write truth and goodnesse for fooles to mislike, than toyes and tryfles for the wise to deride: not ignoraunte, that there are moe finde-faultes than mende-faultes, and moe that are ready to detract other mens doings, than able to make the like of their owne: whereof some thinke they deserue more to be commended (so much they fancie their follie) for discommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of that, in a minute of an houre, whyche the Writer with great study and paine for their greate profite, and the continuall commoditie of many thousandes hath beene a framing and finishing twoo or three yeares. And as a greate sorte for this will fauour me, and not hate mee: Euen so (I am sure) that some therefore will hate me moste spitefully, that rather oughte to loue me earnestly. Whose malice the better to withstande, I haue cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen your Maiestie (as one that is beste able vnder God) to defende me. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whose protection, this may the more safely passe abroade, and thereby be the better accepted, the more desired, the gladlyer receyued, the more willingly perused, the more aduisedly scanned, the lesse detracted, and the better credited. And thus omitting any further to trouble your Highnesse, I, (as one of your most true and faithful subiects) vnfainedly and from the bottome of my heart, do beseeche God, to preserue you from perils, to shielde you from sorrow, to confound al your foes, to defend you from Traytours, to reueale their conspyracies, to frustrate theyr attemptes, and to protecte you in peace.</p>

Al which if you auoide therby, I hope you wil not be vnkinde and vnthankeful to him, that is so zealous and careful for you. Yet for al that, I loke for none other, but that some of you (more wilful than wise, &amp; more churlish than curteous) wil hate me spitefully, for that you ought to loue me faithfully. But suche shal haue no more cause to do so, than the théefe to hate him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> perswades him from stealing.

But be not angry, for if we haue such English enimies (as I am sure we haue) then I must néedes cal them Englishe enimies, if I cal them by their right name: for if I shoulde cal a théefe a true ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or a harlot an honest woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I shold misname the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

            <p>These comparisons duly considered, your Quéene <hi>Mary</hi> did not muche excell oure Quéene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (vnlesse in crueltie and burning hir harmlesse subiects.)

            <p>And further, if Quéene <hi>Mary</hi> hadde a lawe to burne the seruauntes of God, that were obedient to hir, concernyng their worldly duty, and neuer meant hir harm: Then why may not our Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> make a law to execute the Popes seruants, (that are bound to be hir louing subiects) which are disobedient vnto hir, and that séeke, procure, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and wish hir death and destruction?</p>

            <p>What seruant is so foolishe to thinke (much more to say) that bycause his Maister doth not beate him for his faulte, therefore he can not beate him?

Shall hir cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie and mercie make you thinke in hir disabilitie? Therefore, if anye of you thinke so, (as I beléeue some of you haue said so) you are not worthy of suche a mercifull Maistresse that vseth you so. And I am sure that it is the spirite of vnthankfulnesse, the spirite of blindnesse, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of errour, or rather the spirite of the diuel that makes you say so.</p>
            <p>Thinke not I beséech you, that I haue written this for that I woulde haue the Quéenes Maiestie to withdrawe hir mercie from you, and to vse you with crueltie (whiche is contrary to hir milde and merciful nature, if anye other way would serue) for I do it (as the Lord knows my hart) to make you to sée and vnderstand hir great mercy, lenitie, and gentlenesse towards you, thereby to win and allure you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obstinacie to obediencie, from ingratitude to tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, from ignorance to knowlege, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> error to truth.</p>

            <p>Wel, thoughe oure Quéenes quiet gouerning of you, hir merciful vsing of you, &amp; hir longsuffring of you, can not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to loue hir, yet I thinke you would like hir a great deale the better, vppon condition, that she woulde giue you leaue to vse the Romish religion, and to haue your Masses, Trentalles, Dyrges, and Pylgrimages, and suche trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, without controllment. Yea but that were as though Pyrates and théeues should say vnto their King or Prince,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:9415:9"/>
if your grace wil giue vs leaue, to spoyle whome we wyl, to xoaue where we list, and to steale what we can, we wyll loue you and obey you, or else we wil not, or as thoughe schollers shoulde say to their scholemaister: sir if you wyll giue vs leaue to play when we liste, then we wil take you for our scholemaister, or else we wil not: do you not thinke that these are reasonable conditions for Pyrats and Thée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to make to their Prince, or for schollers to make to their scholemaister? of trueth as reasonable and more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable than yours, that you would in this case require of thée Quéene, and more méete to be graunted. For if men did know that Pyrates and théeues had such a plackard of their prince, then merchauntes would purposely prepare themselues to withstand them with strong ships, wel fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with men and munition, and woulde goe in greate fléetes togither. And also true men would make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> strong houses, hauing guns and crossebowes, to withstande the théeues, whereby the Pyrates and théeues might come to there cost and be killed, and the most harme that Pyrates and théeues could do, were but to take their worldly goods, and perhaps their liues from them, hauing no power to hurt their soules. And the schollers that should haue suche a license of their scholemaster, should themselues haue the worst, which when they were men woulde bewayle, that for vain vnprofitable play that lasted but a while, they had lost most profitable learning, which they mighte haue had all their liues.</p>
            <p>But if the Quéenes maiestie should graunt your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is to vse Papist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whose guns, Ingins, and dartes, you were neuer able to resist, and all for wante of Gods word, which is our chiefest armor and defence against him. And so of hir grace you wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lde demaunde your owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. If hir maiestie had graunted that condition in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:9415:10"/>
the first beginning of hir raigne, to all that would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, I am sure that thousandes at this day, had bin blind and ignorant Papists, that ar now perfit protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssors of the Gospell, and hir most faithfull and louing subiects: for though hir godly orders and restraint hath not brought all from Papistry: yet I am certaine that of them it hath diminished a great sort. For as some of you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither wilful and obstinate, and wil not heare the word of God: so some againe are more tractable and come to the Church, wher, they hearing the word of God, are brought from their blindnesse. And further, if the Quéene shoulde grant you this libertie, and suffer you not to haue or heare the word of God, according to your desires, then hir grant would be the cause that you should be vnhappy: for Christe sayeth, <hi>Blessed are they that heare the worde of God and keepe it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 11.</note> nowe if all they that heare the worde of God are not happye (but they that kéepe it) then all they that heare not the word of God, must néedes be vnhappy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so your desire of your Prince is to be vnhappye: and they that are vnhappy are not the children of God, then they must néeds be the children of the Diuel: and thus you woulde loue or like wel of your Quéene, so that she would giue you leaue to be the children of the Diuel.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you wil saye, that you doe not despise the word of God, nor disdaine to heare it, but you would heare it of such as you like of, and not of our Prechers: is that al you can saye? verye well, I am sure that our Preachers appointed by the Quéens maiestie, do preach saluation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the death of Iesus Christ to such as do beleue in him, they teach that good workes are most necessarie, as true to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and signes of a perfecte faythe, they crye out againste sinne, they perswade the Quéenes subiectes to obey &amp; loue hir maiestie, all which I am sure agrées with the worde of God: but if your preachers that you should heare, preache contrarie, that is, that you maye be saued by some other meanes, as by Masses, Trentals, Dirges, or by the Popes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:9415:10"/>
pardons, and if they wil animate and bolden you, to diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey your lawful Quéene and soueraigne, and wil preache remission of sinnes to all men that will fight in the Popes quarrel, whether it be right or wrong, yea thoughe it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their owne King or countrey, you may cal it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> word of God, but I am out of doubt it is the doctrine of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel. Therefore (the premisses well wayed and considered) if you shoulde require at the Quéenes hande to vse fréelye the Romishe religion, without checke or controlemente, truely you know then no more what you aske of hir grace, than the sayd Pyrates or théeues do know what they aske of theyr kyng: or the fonde Schollers of theyr Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maister.</p>
            <p>But if the Quéenes maiestie could not haue your loue but vppon that condition: then she were better to haue your hatred in denying you, than your loue in graunting you. But what if a king shoulde graunt such a libertie to Pirats and théeues, (as <hi>Mogallus</hi> did once king of <hi>Scots</hi>) and the scholemaister to his schollers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hollenshead Chron.</hi>
               </note> might not wise men iudge that the one were more méete to be a Cobler than a King, and the other more fitter to be a Crow-kéeper than a Scholemaister? yes truely. But though you would moste gladly haue such a libertie: yet at hir graces hands you are neuer like to haue it, which you know wel ynough, for hir grace is too wise and too goodly, to grant for vncertain loue a certain mischiefe. For if hir highnesse should graunt you this libertie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, to vse your Romish religion fréely, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue your good wil and loue, would you then loue hir vnfainedly? I hardly beléeue it, for it wil skant stand with your religion, to loue faithfully a pure Protestaunt (who euer he be) which loues gods word, yea though he liue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so godly, (nay perhaps therefore you wil hate him the more) for if he be a Papist indéede, (that is a sound &amp; perfect Papist) he wil not stick to carry fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

friend he hath, or else an haulter to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g him withal. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may say what you wil, but surely I thinke, that you wil neuer loue hir hartily, vnlesse she should become a Papist, (whiche the Lord forbidde) or vnlesse you become Protestants, (which I beséech God to graunt.)</p>
            <p>Is not this a godly religion trow you, that bréedes such charitie in your brestes, making your harts so warme, that you can finde in your hartes so to warme your Christian brother, that neuer after he shall féele any cold? That same religion is it that hath taught you neyther to care for king nor Countrey, that religion is déepe in your breastes that hath wrought this in you, is it not worthy to be embrased, followed, and honored, that teaches true subiects to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true to their prince, and that perswades men to be foes to their Countrey, you may loke a good while in gods worde, or therby you can learne any such lesson. Therefore howe can youre doctrine bee good that maintaines suche mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe?</p>
            <p>Wherfore I beséech you be not wilfully blind, but open your eyes and willingly sée, flie vnto gods worde that will only teache you truely, and cleane not to the Pope for he wil teach you falsely.</p>

was King after the death of King <hi>Saule.</hi> Nowe if worthy <hi>Dauid</hi> being such a great estate woulde not hurt a wicked King, being his enimie, and one that sought his death, but honored and obeyed him, then why shoulde any of you to him farre inferior, procure or wishe any harme, or disobey your most louing, mercifull, and peaceable Princes, that tenderly loues her subiectes, and carefully defendes them, being the chiefe and onely proppe, staye, and pyller, of our safetie, quietnesse, and florishing common wealth.</p>
            <p>I beséeche God kéepe hir from being in such a snare with some of you, as King <hi>Saul</hi> was with his seruant <hi>Dauid.</hi> For then your close meaning would be openly spyed, I feare hir grace should not finde then halfe the fauour at your handes as you haue founde mercie at hir handes: for you that are of the Popes Religion, would not thinke it an offence (as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Dauid</hi> did) to hurt the Lordes annoynted. For the Pope is so farre in your Bookes, that you thinke there is no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but that he can pardon, and that nothing is an offence that woulde please him. So that to please him withall, where he bids you strike, you will not sticke to kill, and to kill where he commaundes, you woulde thinke you did a godly Acte, yea if it were the ruler of a Realme. As though he had a commission, to kill Kings and others at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>Marke how the Pope and king <hi>Dauid</hi> differs, The Pope will blesse you, pardon &amp; forgiue you (though God will not) and reward you, for killing them that neuer did him harme: But King <hi>Dauid</hi> caused him to bée killed,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15.</note> that killed his mortall enimie King <hi>Saule,</hi> yea and that at King <hi>Saules</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.

               <hi>and exercises himselfe therein day and night</hi>: whereas the Pope curseth them that exercises themselues in the worde of God, and hydes and burnes the word of God.</p>
            <p>But say what we will, and proue what wée can against the Pope, you are so farre in loue wyth him and his holye lawes, and especially his Masse, that you care not though al runne on whéeles, so that you myght haue it here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande.</hi> You may haue it if you will, there is no penaltie of death on it: Marrie they are some thing dearer than they were wont to be: for the day hath bin that you mighte haue had one for a groate, but nowe they are so deare, that I thinke you had rather steale them priuily, than buye them openly. And I will not say, but that you may steale a Masse in a corner, as diuers haue done: but if you do so, you are verie théeues to God, to your Prince, &amp; to your selues: for thereby you rob God of his glory, the Quéene of hir du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and your owne soules of heauenly felicitie.</p>
            <p>O how are you bewitched with blindnesse, do you knowe what mischiefes the Masse would bring with it, if it might be suffred openly and fréely againe in this Realme, I know well you do not: for if you did, you would not be so desirous of it, you would faine haue the drinke, but you consider not the poyson y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is in it. I may compare you to théeues which construe the best, but consider not the worst. For théeues before they steale, do say among themselues: we shall haue a iolly bootie, it will make vs men for euer, it will buy vs trim apparell, we shall fare like Lordes, and we shall lyue like gentlemen: and so they stay there, and reason no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:9415:12"/>
but therewith they consider not how therby they shall offend God (than which nothing can be worse) they cast not aforehand, that they may chaunce to misse of their purpose, and may pay as déerely as though they had it: they do not consider the great shame they may reape therby: they quite forget, that if they be knowne and taken, that therfore they shall be hanged. Thus théeues vse to debate aforehand of al the best that may happen, &amp; leaue out al the worst that most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly doth happen: euen so, you cast in your heads what great comfort and ioy it woulde be to your minde and fond fancie, if you might once enioy here your Masse againe, but you respect not the manifolde mischiefes that your Masse would bring with it, as the great idolatry you should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thereby, the heauie wrath of God you shoulde procure thereby, and the torments of hell fire that you should gaine thereby, for séeking saluation therein, which can be found in nothing, but in the death of Christ, and by beléeuing in him.</p>
            <p>Here is inough I thinke, but yet here is not all, for if the Masse come in, shée must haue hir waiting men come with hir also, and what are they I pray you? if you say you can not tell, yet I am sure that I can tell, these they are, marke them well: warres, troubles, discordes, contentions, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, miserie, bondage, losse of goods, yea, and losse of liues and libertie, which some of you may haply like them before they are come, but none of vs all I thinke would like them, if they should come.</p>
            <p>The Lord kéepe that monstrous Masse, hir relickes, and hir retinue out of this Realme. And I beséeche God prosper our Quéene that hath banished hir, and will by Gods helpe kéepe hir out during hir life, yet you doate so much of your Masse, and of the Romish religion, that you thinke, if you had it here, that then you should haue more plentie, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and peace, than you haue. Beléeue it who will, for I will not. But if we had it, (as the Lorde kéepe it from vs) you shoulde then knowe it better by féeling, than you will beléeue me by telling.

Masse can bring vs more plentie, quietnesse, and prosperitie by Idolatrie, than our worthie Quéene or Maistresse hath brought to vs with Gods worde? if the Diuell doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade you, that it will be so, Gods word doth assure vs, that it cannot be so.

Therefore as Papistes and we are contrarie in religion: so, if a Papist should raigne ouer you after our Quéene, looke for contrarietie in regiment, and not for the like, as trouble for quietnesse, warres for peace, penurie for plentie, follie for prudencie, vnaduisednesse for pollicie, aduersitie for prosperitie, slauerie for equalitie, bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage for libertie, and crueltie for mercie, and so be sure for contraries in all the rest of this our most blessed and happy gouernment.</p>
            <p>How fond are you that beléeue that you shall still enioy this your happy state, thoughe you change Gods true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and your mercifull gouernesse? what woman is so foolish, that liued quietly and merily vnder hir first husband that was godlye and vertuous, that will thinke to liue as quietly and merily after with a wicked shrewde and crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed husband? who will thinke, that if he change the bright day for the darke night, that yet for al that he shal kéepe the right way, &amp; goe without daunger? none vnlesse mad men or fooles.

            <p>They that are not content with a faire hot Sunne-shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning day, without Winde or cloudes, but are desirous of change of weather, then they must looke that their change of weather shall be winde, rayne, clouds, frost, snow, stormes, tempests, or lightning and thunder (for fayrer weather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had before they can not haue) so your goodlye change that you desire and hope for, must néedes be warres, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, penurie, aduersitie, crueltie, and such like as before is mentioned.</p>

Curssed shalt thou be in the Towne and curssed also in the field, curssed shal be thy basket and thy Dough, cursed shal be the fruite of thy bodie, and the fruite of thy land, the encrease of thy kine &amp; the flockes of thy sheepe, cursed shalte thou be when thou comest in, and cursed also when thou goest out. The Lorde shall sende vpon thee cursing, trouble, and shame in all that whiche thou settest thy hande to do, vntil thou be destroyed and perish quickly, bicause of the wickednesse of thy works whereby thou hast forsaken me, the Lorde shall make the pestilence cleaue to thee, vntill hee hath consumed thee, &amp;c.

            <p>Here you may sée the great blessings of God, promised to his people that hearken to his voyce and obey his lawes and commaundementes, so that they decline neither to the right hand nor to the left hand, to goe after other Gods or to serue them, which blessings most plentifully he hath poured on this Realme of <hi>England</hi> euer since our gracious Quéene put downe Idolatrie and Papistrie, and set forth the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and word of God.</p>
            <p>And also here you may plainely perceiue and vnderstand the maruellous curses and plagues promised and threatned to them that will not obey the voyce of the Lord our God, and kéepe his commaundementes and ordinaunces, which plagues and cursses haue aboundantlye lyghted on those Countreys and Kingdomes that embrace and maintayne Idolatrous Papistrie, reiecting the Gospell, and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Professours thereof. Which is a manifest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that this Religion that we haue, is the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherewith God is well pleased, and your Papisticall doctrine, is a false and wicked religion, wherewith God is highlye displeased, For as God did prosper and blesse the Iewes, his people, to whome <hi>Moyses</hi> pronounced the sayde blessings, so long as they hearkened to his voyce, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9415:15"/>
obeyed and followed his word and commaundements: and as hys sayde plagues and cursses fell vpon them, when they harkened not to the voyce of the Lord, but committed Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: euen so euer since he hath and doeth blesse and prosper, the professors and followers of his worde, and poures his sayde plagues and cursses on them that despise his worde, that are enimies to the Gospell, and persecute the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the same.</p>
            <p>Marke well and you shall sée, that in all ages, God gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, protected, and blessed, the Kings and Rulers that clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their Countreys of Idolatrie, and that did set forth and obeyed his law.</p>
            <p>What famous victories did he giue to <hi>Iosua</hi> the Duke and Captaine of the Israelites, which obeyed God and harkened to his voyce? to whom God spake as followeth: <hi>Moyses my seruant is deade, nowe therefore arise, goe ouer this Iorden, thou and all thy people,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>vnto the lande whiche I giue them, that is, to the children of Israell, euerye place that the sole of your foote shall treade vppon, haue I giuen you, as I sayd vnto Moyses, from the Wildernesse, &amp; this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon, vnto the greate riuer Perath, all the lande of the Hettites euen vnto the great Sea, towarde the going downe of the Sunne shal be your coaste. There shall not a man bee able to withstand thee all the dayes of thy life. As I was with Moyses, so will I be with thee. I will not leaue thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake thee. Be strong &amp; of a good courage, for vnto this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shalt thou deuide the land for an inheritaunce, which I sware vnto their Fathers to giue them, onely be thou strong and of a most valiant courage, that thou mayest obserue &amp; doe according to all the law which Moyses my seruant hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded thee. Thou shalt not turne awaye from it, to the right hand nor to the lefte, that thou mayest prosper wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer thou goest, let not this booke of the law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day &amp; night, that thou mayest obserue and do according to all that is written ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: for then shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and then
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:9415:16"/>
shalt thou haue good successe.</hi> These were the wordes that God spake to <hi>Iosua.</hi> Therfore marke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promises of God to him, if he follow &amp; do according to the law of God, then his way shold be prosperous, he should haue good successe, none should withstand him al the dayes of his life, &amp; God would be with him, which in déede God performed wonderfully, and kept promise with him, for that he hearkned to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> voyce of the Lord, and directed al his wayes according to the law of God.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iosua.</hi> 3.</note> For was not God with <hi>Iosua,</hi> when miraculously he departed the water of <hi>Iorden,</hi> and the children of Israel went drie ouer the same,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iosu.</hi> 6.</note> straight towardes <hi>Iericho?</hi> did not God wonderfully deliuer <hi>Iericho</hi> to <hi>Iosua</hi> and his people, when after the sounding of the Trumpettes the walles thereof fell downe through his power, and so <hi>Iosua</hi> and all his people went into it, and tooke the Citie? and so they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed all the Idolatrous people, the enimies of God that were in the same. But sée howe sodainely the Lorde went from them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iosua.</hi> 7.</note> and suffered the men of <hi>Ai</hi> to kill .xxxvj. of the Israelites, and made the rest of thrée thousande of them fearefully to flée away: bicause <hi>Achan</hi> in the spoyle of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo</hi> tooke that for a praye, which the Lorde directly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to the contrarie.</p>
            <p>Thus you may easily perceiue, that the harkening to the voyce of God, &amp; following of his worde, is the cause of good successe and victorie, and the disobeying of his worde, and following of their owne fansies, was the cause of euil suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse and ouerthrowe. But God blessed <hi>Iosua</hi> still, bicause he was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>senting to <hi>Achans</hi> fact, who stoned him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to death: for after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, the Lord made <hi>Iosua</hi> to vanquish and ouercome the fiue Kings of the <hi>Amorits,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iosua.</hi> 10.</note> in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, the Lord threw stones from heauen vpon his enimies: and at <hi>Iosuas</hi> bydding, the Sunne and Moone did stand still a whole day togither, that he might haue time to ouercome his enimies.</p>
            <p>These wonders did the Lord for his seruant <hi>Iosua</hi> and his people that harkened to his voyce, and obeyed his worde.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9415:16"/>
Many other kings did <hi>Iosua</hi> ouercome through the strength of the Lord that fought for him and his people. And when <hi>Iosua</hi> waxed olde, then he called all Israel, their elders,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iosua.</hi> 23.</note> their heades, their Iudges and their officers before him, giuing them then the same warning that <hi>Moyses</hi> and God gaue him, to hearken to the voyce of the Lorde, saying, I am old and stricken in age, also you haue séene all that the Lorde you God hath done vnto all these nations before you, howe the Lorde hath fought for you. Behold I haue diuided vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you by lot these nations that remaine (that as yet were not ouercome) to bée an inheritaunce accordyng to your Tribes from <hi>Iorden,</hi> with all the nations that I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed euen vnto the great sea Westward. And the Lord your God shal expell them before you and cast them out of your sight. And ye shall possesse their lande, as the Lorde your God hath sayde vnto you. Bée ye therefore of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant courage to obserue and doe all that is written in the Booke of the lawe of <hi>Moyses,</hi> that ye turne not ther from to the right hande nor to the lefte, &amp;c. But sticke faste vnto the Lorde your God as yée haue done vnto this daye, for the Lorde hath cast out before you great nations and mightie, and no man hath stande before your face hitherto. One man of you shall chase a thousande, for your Lorde your God hée fyghteth for you as he hath promysed you. Take good héede therefore vnto your selues, that yée loue the Lorde your GOD: Else if yée goe backe, &amp;c: knowe yée for certayne, that the Lorde your God will cast out no more of these nations from before you, but they shall bée a snare and destruction to you, and a whippe on your sides, and thornes in your eyes, vntill you perish out of this good land, which the Lorde your God hath giuen you, &amp;c. Therefore as all good things are come vppon you, whiche the Lorde your God promised you: so shall the Lorde bring vpon you, euery euil thing, vntil he hath destroyed you out of this good lande, which the Lorde your God hath giuen you: when ye
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:9415:17"/>
shall trangresse the couuenant of the Lord your God which he commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded you, and shall go and serue other Gods and bow your selues to them, then shall the wrath of the Lorde wax hot against you, and ye shall quickly perishe out of the good land which he hath giuen you.</p>
            <p>This was the lesson that <hi>Iosua</hi> a little before his death gaue vnto the Israelites his people. And thus may you sée that al the charge that God and the godly giueth, is to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the voyce of the Lord and obey his law, which is his word, and he wyl defend, prosper and fight for vs no longer than we abide in the same. So that the prosperous successe, victories, and other great blessings of Kings and Rulers that knowe Gods worde, and professe the same, is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Argument, that they walke rightly in his wayes, and that he is wel pleased with them. And such Kings, Princes, and Rulers, as haue troubles, warres, euill successe, and are ouercome in battell of their enemies, thoughe they say they haue the true doctrine of God, and that they follow it, and obserue it most truely of all other: yet it is an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble token, that they do offend their Lord God, that they doe not walke rightly, nor obserue his lawes and word as they ought, and that he is not wel pleased with them.</p>
            <p>And thus as God did blesse &amp; prosper <hi>Iosua</hi> and all other before him, that hearkned to his voyce, &amp; obeyed his worde: euen so he did to other that did likewise after him: For God gaue such wonderfull successe to <hi>Iudah</hi> the Captaine of the Israelites,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iud.</hi> 1.</note> (who feared God, &amp; obeyed his worde) against <hi>Adoni-Bezek,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Cananites,</hi> as he gaue to <hi>Iosua.</hi> And <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> did cut off the thumbes off his handes and off his féete, according to the iust iudgement of God, for his great ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie vsed to other: for the sayde tyrant <hi>Adoni-Bezek</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that he had vsed seauentie Kings before in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and they gathered bread vnder his table. And then hée was compelled to say thus: <hi>As I haue done, God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God also blessed the sayde <hi>Iudah</hi> and the Israelites, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:9415:17"/>
gaue them many wonderfull victories after that, againste their enimies, the <hi>Cananites</hi> and heathen Idolators. But when the <hi>Israelites</hi> hearkened not to the voyce of the Lorde, and disobeyed his worde,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iud.</hi> 3.</note> and worshipped the Gods of the <hi>Cananites,</hi> and did wickedly in the sight of the Lorde: then the Lordes furie and wrath kindled and waxed hote against them, so that he suffered them to be ouercome, and he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them into their enemies handes that spoyled them, and he solde them into their enemies handes, so that they coulde stande no longer before their enemies,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iud.</hi> 2.</note> and whether soeuer they went out, the Lord was against them, according as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had promised.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iud.</hi> 3.</note> And God suffered the king of <hi>Aram</hi> to preuaile against them, and to carry them away wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> him. And so serued him, &amp; were captiues vnder him eight yéeres.</p>
            <p>Consider also howe wonderfully <hi>Gedeon</hi> the Capitaine of the <hi>Israelites</hi> (that hearkened to the voyce of the Lorde) with thrée hundreth men, through Gods power and might,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iud.</hi> 7.</note> did ouercome the huge armie of the <hi>Madianites,</hi> that were as Grassehoppers in number.</p>
            <p>What a victorie did God giue to little <hi>Dauid</hi> his seruant against the mightie Giant <hi>Goliah</hi> his enemie?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.</note> howe did he prosper him, blesse him, and fight for him against the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines, whose Images he burnt, which pleased God?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.8.</note> And as God hath and doeth daylye giue victorie to such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Kings, and Rulers, that hearkened to his voyce and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed his worde: so he hath giuen and doth giue maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous quietnesse and peace to such Kings, Princes and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, as do the same.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 14.</note> For God did prosper and blesse king <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> which hearkned to his voice, and obserued his law, making him raigne in a maruelous quietnesse and peace the space of fiue and thirtie yéeres, bicause he tooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <hi>Sodomites</hi> out of the lande, and put away all the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols that his father had made, and tooke away the Aultars of strange Gods, and the high places, and brake downe the Images, &amp; cut down the Groues, and commaunded <hi>Iuda</hi> to séeke the Lorde God of their fathers, and to doe according
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9415:18"/>
to the lawe and the commaundement. And he tooke awaye out of all the Cities of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the high places &amp; the Images: therfore the kingdome was quiet before him, and the Lord gaue him rest on euery side.</p>
            <p>And as the Lorde did prosper and blesse King <hi>Asa</hi> wyth suche a quietnesse and peace, for breaking downe the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars of the straunge Gods, and destroying the Images set vp by <hi>Abija</hi> his father: euen so he hath blessed and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our most gratious Quéene with a most plentifull peace al the time of hir raigne, which is thrée and twentie yéeres, (beséeching God to triple it with the quiet raigne of King <hi>Asa</hi>) for plucking downe the Aultars, for breaking and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the Images, for abolishing the most Idolatrous Masse (the Popes inuented sacrifice) committed and done on these Aultars, &amp; for the extirping and rooting vp the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable law &amp; religion of the Pope, erected &amp; planted by hir sister Quéene <hi>Marie,</hi> to the great dishonor of God, &amp; the derogation of the passion of our sauior Iesus Christ: setting forth in steade thereof, not onely in euery Citie, but also in euerie towne and village throughout hir whole Realme of <hi>England,</hi> the pure and perfect word and lawe of God.</p>
            <p>And thus it is plaine, that the cause of the quiet raigne of King <hi>Asa,</hi> and the peaceable and quiet raigne of our Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is all one. Which is, for the putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of Idolatrie, which God doth most abhorre: &amp; for the setting forth of his law &amp; word, which he doth chiefly desire.</p>
            <p>But thoughe King <hi>Asa</hi> had peace al this while, bicause he abolished Idolatrie and hearkned vnto the voice of God: yet after whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did slide fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, &amp; put not his whole trust in him, the case was then cleane altred, for the Lorde tooke his peace awaye, and God sent to him the Prophet <hi>Hanani,</hi> who spake vnto King <hi>Asa</hi> as followeth:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 16.</note> 
               <hi>Bycause thou hast rested vpon the King of Aram, and not rested in the Lorde thy God, therefore is the hoste of the King of Aram escaped out of thine hande. The Aethiopians and Lybyanes, were they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:9415:18"/>
not a great host with Chariots and horsmen exceeding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? yet bycause thou didst rest vppon the Lorde, he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them into thine hande. For the eyes of the Lorde beheld al the earth, to shewe himselfe strong with them, that are of perfect heart toward him. Thou hast then done foolishly in this, therefore from henceforth thou shalt haue warres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we may sée, that King <hi>Asas</hi> peace and quietnesse was turned into warres and trouble, bicause he slidde from the Lorde, and hearkned not to his voyce: euen so if your Idolatrous Masse shoulde be planted and vsed here as you desire: then our prosperitie and peace would be turned into aduersitie and warres.</p>
            <p>And then King <hi>Asa</hi> to mend the matter withall, did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison the Prophet for telling him so, and did not repent and turne to the Lorde, as King <hi>Dauid</hi> did when the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> reproued him, which encreased the Lordes displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the more against him. Here it is manifest, as before, and as it is throughe the whole Scriptures, that God doth blesse his people with victorie, quietnesse and peace, so long as they stay vpon him and obey his worde, and no longer.</p>
            <p>Marke how God did blesse that good and vertuous King <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> the sonne of King <hi>Asa,</hi> with victories, peace,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 17.</note> and great riches, bycause he walked rightly in the sight of God, and abolished Idolatry, which godly &amp; vertuous King in the third yéere of his raigne sent his Princes and Rulers and learned men with them, to set forth Gods lawe, and to teach it in the Cities of <hi>Iudah.</hi> And they did teache it in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and had the Booke of the lawe of the Lord with them, and went about throughout al the cities of <hi>Iudah</hi> (his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) and taught the people. And the feare of the Lorde fell vpon all the kingdomes of the landes that were rounde about <hi>Iudah.</hi> And they fought not against <hi>Iehosaphat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe weigh the comparison, and consider the like or more. Hath not the Lorde likewyse blessed our gratious Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with an vnfoughten victorie, without any bloudshed, against hir rebellious subiects the Papists,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:9415:19"/>
and hath not he besides blessed hir with such a plenty, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and peace, al the rest of hir raigne, as before was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer séene in <hi>England?</hi> bicause she hath hearkned to the voice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord as <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> did: who staid not vntill the third yéere of hir raigne, but in the first yéere, and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therof, abolished Idolatrie, and did set forth the worde of God, the holy Bible in the Englishe tongue, throughout all <hi>England,</hi> not onely in Cities, but also in all townes, vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and other places, and commaunded, and gaue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, to all hir Bishops, Doctours, Preachers, Curates and Ministers, to preache, teache, and vse the same purelye and rightly, and all other hir Magistrates to defende it. And accordingly, al the time of hir worthy raigne it hath béene, and is dayly preached and taught throughout all <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the feare of the Lord fell vpon al the kingdomes of the landes that were round about <hi>Iudah,</hi> and they fought not against King <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi>: euen so the Lorde our God hath feared all the Countries and Kingdomes round about <hi>Englande,</hi> and therefore they haue not fought against our Quéene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Thus you cannot choose but grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that if <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> was blessed and prospered of God, then our Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is blessed and prospered of God: if <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaphat</hi> was a good King and did please God, then our <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> is a good Quéene and pleaseth God: and if that were Idolatrie that <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> did abolish out of <hi>Iudah,</hi> then pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie was Idolatrous that our Quéene hath abolished out of <hi>England:</hi> and if that were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of God that <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> proclaymed, published, and caused to be taught throughout <hi>Iudah,</hi> then this is the very lawe and word of God, that our Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> hath set forth throughout al hir Realme of <hi>Englande.</hi>

(thoughe he was the sonne of godlye King <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi>) This king <hi>Iehoram,</hi> when he was placed in the kingdome of <hi>Iudah</hi> after his father, slew and killed his brethren and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes of <hi>Israel,</hi> he walked not according as <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> his father did, but wrought euil in gods sight.

Then the Lord stirred vp against Iehoram the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines, and the Arabians, and they came vp into Iudah, and brake into it, and carryed away al the substance that was in the Kings house, and his sons also and his wiues, so that there was not a son left him, saue Iehoahaz the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest of his sons.

            <p>And againe you may sée, vnlesse you do wilfully winke, that the abolishing of Idolatrie, &amp; setting forth of the lawe of God, was the cause, that God did blesse and prosper good King <hi>Iehoshaphat:</hi> and contrary, the committing of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and the compelling of the people of <hi>Iudah</hi> to sin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the forsaking of the law of God, was the cause that God did thus plague and punish wicked <hi>Iehoram</hi> his son, with wars, with the taking awaye of his sons and wiues,

and spoyling his house, and with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> falling out of his guts wherof he dyed.</p>
            <p>Here you may easily perceiue, that God spared not wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Iehoram,</hi> though he were the sonne of godlye Kyng <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> whom God loued so wel, for it is not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or place, but the truth and the godlinesse of the person whatsoeuer he be, and whersoeuer he be, that God doeth respect.

            <p>Perhaps some wil saye, if they that get the victorie ouer their enimies are blessed of God, &amp; so they are the people of God: Then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Heathen Idolaters are blessed of God, &amp; are Gods people: for they haue had &amp; haue dayly good successe &amp; victory ouer their enimies, yea, &amp; haue many times ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the people of God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had his law &amp; his word.

The rodde is not good bycause it doth beate the childe: but the rodde doth beate the child by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the childe is euil. It is manifest before, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel were ouercome and carried away Captiue of King <hi>Aram,</hi> an Heathen Idolatour, yet King <hi>Aram</hi> &amp; his people was not blessed of God,<note place="margin">

Captiues by them, bycause they did forsake the Lord, diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed his worde, and committed Idolatrie, for so God did promisse. The scriptures are ful of the like examples.</p>
            <p>It is most manifest throughout the whole Scriptures, that God hathe chieflye blessed those Kings and countries with wealth, prosperitie, and victorie, which mightily and spéedily pluckte down Images and false Gods, and did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpe and destroy Idolatrie, and set forth earnestly and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously the worde and lawe of God: though they in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular things somtimes offended, as King <hi>Dauid</hi> did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But those Kings that cast away Gods word, and hearkned not to his voice, but fel to Idolatrie, and worshipped Idolles and strange Gods, (thoughe they were neuer so godly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) immediatly the Lords wrath kindled against them, and stirred vp enimies to fight with them, and sold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered them into their enimies hands: &amp; suffred them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be killed, wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully to be plagued, or to be caryed awaye prisoners and captiues. So that hereby it plainely appeareth, that the most safetie, quietnesse, prosperitie, and victorie of a Prince and his people, and to be moste assured to haue God on their side, and to defende them, is to sette forth and maintaine the true lawe of God, and the Gospell of Christe, and to plucke vp, put away, deteste and abhorre all Idolatrie, superstition, and all religions whatsoeuer, that are contrary to Gods word. But as al the Kings and people that did set forth and obey <hi>Moses</hi> lawe, and suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and put downe Idolatrie before Christ, were then the people of God, and so blessed, prospered, and defended of him: Euen so al the Kings, Princes, and Rulers, and their

But sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God stoode with the Emperour and gaue him the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and ouerthrew the Pope, and gaue him the foile: Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is manifest according to Gods promisses before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the Emperour was of a true religion, that God was wel pleased with him, and that he was the better chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian: and that the Pope was of a wrong religion, &amp; walkt not rightly according to Gods lawe, and so no good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and therefore displeased God. Thus you maye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectely vnderstande, that as God béefore the commyng of Christe, did blesse and giue victorie, to the Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers that set forth and folowed <hi>Moses</hi> law, plaguing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying their enimies: Euen so now God dothe blesse and prosper the Christian Princes and Rulers that sette forth, fauour, &amp; defend the gospell of Christ, and dothe plague and destroy the enimies of the true Chrystians that embrace and followe the same. And as God (before Christe was borne) didde prosper and defende none but the Iewes that followed <hi>Moses</hi> lawe, and called them onelye hys people: Euen so since the time of Christ, he doth prosper and defend
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:9415:22"/>
none, but onely them that professe and followe Christs gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, named Christians. And as the often reading, hearing, and perusing of the same lawe of <hi>Moses</hi> was the chief way for the Iewes to knowe it: and to knowe it perfectlye, the nexte waye to followe it: and to follow it truely, the chiefe meane for God to blesse and defend them: Euen so oure of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reading, perusing, and hearing of the Gospell, is the chiefe waye for vs to knowe Gods will and pleasure and to knowe it perfectelye, is the nexte waye for vs to followe it: and to followe it truely, is the chiefe meane for God to blesse, prosper, and defend vs, in this worlde, and through Christe to saue vs euerlastingly in the worlde to come.</p>
            <p>Nowe, if there be none other waye for vs to bée blessed and defended of God, than by hearing, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and perusing the Scriptures, (as moste cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainelye there is not) then they muste néedes bée vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, haue euil successe, and be subiect to all mischiefs, that wil not reade it, peruse it, heare it, nor knowe it. Therefore these Papists are vnhappy &amp; accurssed, that will not reade, peruse, heare, nor know the Scriptures, the knowledge and following whereof, is the fountaine of all blessednesse and happinesse.</p>
            <p>Perhappes some of you will saye, Were all oure fore-elders vnhappy, curssed or damned, that didde not heare, reade, and beléeue thys lawe that you now teach? whome I aunsweare thus: Are all the Apostles and Martyres that dyed for professyng thys oure Lawe or Gospell, and all the holye olde Fathers that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hearde of the Pope nor of hys Lawe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so all oure and youre Fathers, bréethren, sisters, and kinsfolkes, besides manye thousandes that haue refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Pope and his lawe, vnhappy, curssed, or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</p>

Therefore all you that cleaue to the Pope and his law, and refuse the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which is Christs law, do highly displease God.

            <p>I beséeche you consider, that the worde of God whiche we haue, and the Masse which you woulde haue, are so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the one to the other, and are such Enimies, that they can no more dwel togither quietly, than the Arke of God could with <hi>Dagon:</hi>

And as hir Grace dothe kéepe the same oute by force, so, if you haue it againe (in hir life time) it muste bée brought in by force. And as the Quéene is the champion of Gods word, to kéepe out Idolatrie: so must some Papistes be champions to bring in Idolatrie. And who woulde they be I pray you?

            <p>Perhaps some of you may thinke, that the straungers you wish to come hither (though they be foes to the Quéen, and come to fight against hir Maiestie &amp; vs) will not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use you, for that you and they are of one religion.

Do not many kill their very friendes for their goodes and money, though they be of their religion?

            <p>These miseries, troubles, and thraldomes, then (and at many other times) didde oure auncestoures féele in this lande by the comming in of their foes, whiche (blessed bée God therefore) neither you nor we do féele. And I beséech God that we neuer do feele, which both you and we should féele, if so many of the Popes souldiors were here as some of you wishe, to helpe and aide you against our Quéene, to sette vppe youre Masse and Papistrie: (though you thinke they would be friendly to you for your religion.) For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this wel I beséeche you, what battayles, what mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, what bloudshead, what burning of Towns, what spoyling of Countreys, and what dolefull destructions haue there bin throughout al <hi>Europe,</hi> at one time or other, (no Realme nor Countrey excepted) in the space of foure

or fiue hundreth yeares? when euery one professed and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Popes religion? and almost fewe (or none in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect) knewe any other religion? And who were they that didde thus murther one an other, spoile one an other, and burne and consume one anothers Country? were they not al of the Popes law? and of his religion? yes truely. Now, if Papistes made battailes with Papistes, if Papistes mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Papists, if Papists spoyled Papists, if Papists bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Countries of Papists, if Papists did winne realms and kingdoms from Papists, if Papists made themselues Lordes ouer Papistes, and if Papistes made bond-slaues of Papistes, (hauing no colour to suspecte them, but that they were Papistes, and of their owne religion.) Then, doe you thinke that the Popes papisticall Souldiours that you woulde procure or wishe, to fight againste our Quéene and hir louing subiectes, wil spare you though you are Papists, and of their religion, hauing a great colour to take you for Protestants, whome they vtterly enuy and hate? beléeue it not. Therefore neither procure nor wish for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in of the Romaine Souldioures against our Quéene, to sette vppe your Masse and other the Popes paltrie. But be true rather and louing Subiectes to hir grace, and ayde and helpe hir (if néede be) to kepe both them and it out of the realme.</p>
            <p>We in <hi>England</hi> haue bin so long broughte vp in the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and preaching of the gospell, that these Papists that are oure forraine foes, thinke we are almost al Protestants (whome they call Heretikes) (for whiche they abhorre vs more than if we were notorious murtherers, drunkardes, aduouterers, or fornicators) for lette anye of our Papistes trauaile beyonde the Seas among them, if they know once that he is an Englishe manne, straightwaye they saye (or iudge hym at the leaste) to bée a Protestant, thoughe hée bée as déepe or a déeper Papiste<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than themselues,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:9415:25"/>
(vnlesse they knowe him verye well to be a Papiste.) And thus, though they thinke there are many Papists in diuers other countreys, yet they thinke there are fewe or none in <hi>Englande.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therfore, séeing now these our forraine foes (such as you wish to come and fight against our Prince and Countrey) wil not be persuaded that you are Papists, when they can lose nothing by trusting you: thinke you then (if they were here) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you could persuade them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you are Papistes, when they maye haue al your landes and goodes by mystrusting you? No I warrant you. Therefore you may then tel them long ynoughe, that you are of their religion, ere they will beléeue you, or at the leaste fauour you.</p>
            <p>The Angels of Heauen were and are all of one religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hadde the verye right religion I thinke, (for if there were anye one religion better than an other, it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like they haue it in Heauen) yet throughe Pryde, <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> and a greate number of his fellowes, were not content with their estate,<note place="margin">

               </note> but meant not onelye to be aboue their fellowes, but also to be equall with God.</p>
            <p>Perhappes some of you will saye, thoughe the Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles are of a pure religion, they are no Protestantes: wel, whatsoeuer they are, I am sure they loue and obey God and hys worde: And therefore I dare boldelye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyrme, that they are no Papistes, (vnlesse those Aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that became Diuels and fel out of Heauen, are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, which is very like, for both the Pope and the Diuels are quite contrarye to God.)</p>
            <p>Nowe, if the holy Aungelles of Heauen that were of the purest religion, béeyng all vnder one King, the beste King of al other, and in one kingdome, woulde haue exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselues aboue their fellowe Angells (though they were al of one religion) disdeining y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their fellows should be equall with them: Then do you thinke that the earthlye Papists y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you procure or wish to come &amp; fight against our Prince &amp; country, that are of a false and wicked religion, in

For if they be not, it wil be bycause they can not.</p>
            <p>Let the crueltie and tyrannie done to our neyghbours in <hi>Flaunders</hi> (but euen yesterday to speake of) be a sufficient spectacle, warning and example to you, for procuring of the Popes souldiours to ayde you against your prince &amp; hir lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing subiectes, to set vp your masse &amp; the Popes doctrine: (though they be of your religion) for was there none spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, defloured, rauished, misused and killed there but onlye Protestants trow you? Ask <hi>Antwerp</hi> and it wil quickly tell you: besides diuerse other places, that therin can say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing And who were they that vsed them thus? were they not the Captaines of their own Prince and ruler, (though perhaps they did so without his wil)? Now if the Papists spoyled, defloured, rauished, misused, and killed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> subiects of their own king and Prince? (for al they were Papists &amp; of their own religion) then wil the Popes souldiours (that you procure or desire to fight against your prince) spare you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are not their Princes subiectes? (though they be of your religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?) if you beléeue it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you are not so wise as I wish you.</p>
            <p>And though these the Popes souldiours (that you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure or wish, to enter in any of the Quéenes dominions, to fight against hir highnesse and hir obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t subiects, to help you vp with your masse and other the Popes paltry) do make you beléeue before they come, that it is only to ayde and help you against your Prince, and that (if they get the victorie) they wil be fauourable to you, or be at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, that are of the Popes religion, and that they

wil not spoyle or hurt you, but onely the Protestantes: yet what if they say then (when they sée your great wealth and riches) that you are Protestants? (for wealth, riches, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, money, lands, and greate liuings are able to entise them to make Protestants of Papists) if they then spoyle you, cruelly vse you, turne you out of al your goods, lands, &amp; liuings, murther you, kil you, make slaues of you, &amp; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trust you nor suffer you to be in any authority (though you cry neuer so loude vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, saying, we are Catholicks which hold of the Pope, we are of your religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we procure you to come hither, we sent for you to help vs vp w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Masse) if they vse you thus (as no doubt they woulde if they coulde) in what case are you then? what remedy shall you haue of them for mistaking of you? where wil you sue them? in what courte wil you commence your action a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them? no, no, there wil be no remedie to be hadde of them, vnlesse crying, wéeping, howling, and wringing of hands, wil remedie the matter. Marke a preatie example. The Lion made a proclamation that no horned beast vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on paine of death shoulde come within seuen myles of the Courte. Whereof when the silly Hare hearde, she ranne from the Courte as fast as euer she coulde, to whome the Foxe sayde méeting hir, why dost thou runne so faste? to whom the Hare sayde, it is time to runne apace I trowe: why so sayde the Fox? to whome the Hare aunsweared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, dost thou not knowe of the kyngs Proclamation, that if anye horned beaste be founde within seauen my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the Courte, that they shoulde dye for it? that is true sayde the Foxe, but that Proclamation toucheth thée neuer a witte, for thine be eares that thou hast, they are no hornes. I know that sayd the Hare as wel as thou, but what if the King say they are hornes, where am I the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Euen so if the Popes soldiours (that you wish to come to fight against our Quéene) saye that you are Protestaunts (though you are as rancke Papists as they) wher are you then? you were then as good to be protestauntes, for you
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9415:26"/>
shold pay as déepe as they. Think not but that they could regarde rather your ryches than your religion, your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings than your lawe, and your possessions than their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. For it is a maxime and a rule with the Pope and his partakers, that <hi>Fides non est seruanda haereticis, Faith (or promise) is not to be kept with Heretickes.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Thus you may sée (if thou be not starke blinde) how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine foes haue vsed our auncestours, for all they were of their religion. And thinke you to haue better lucke at the Popes Souldiours hands, if according to your procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente or wish they should come hither to fight against our Quéene and vs, (if they be able at the least) than our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours hadde of forraine foes, or the Citizens of <hi>Rhegum,</hi> of them of <hi>Himera,</hi> whom they sent for to ayde them against their own brethren and Citizens, before mentioned? you may beléeue it if you wil: but you shal neuer féele it if you would.</p>
            <p>But suppose that the Popes souldiours that you wish to come hither, to sette vppe your Masse and Papistrye woulde fauour you, defende and saue you that are Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manystes, for that you shoulde be of theyr religion, yet you are sure that they would spoyle, burne, and kil vs both Prince and Protestauntes, (if their power were to theyr pretence) whereof some would be your owne fathers, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, sisters, brothers, wiues, children kinsfolks, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deare friends, which (if you be the children of God) you would not only feare that we shold féele, but also your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues abhorre to sée.</p>
            <p>Alacke for pitie, how can you perswade your selues to be in the right way, and that the same that you embrace is the right law of God, whiche can be content to sée your most louing Prince spoyled, your parentes persecuted, your sisters murthered, youre brethren burned, your wiues misused, your sonnes torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, your daughters destroyed, your kinsfolks killed, your faithful friends fired, and your

Countrey folkes consumed. The Lord open your eyes, for this is far wide from Christs religion, though it be iumpe with the Popes religion.</p>
            <p>If you are of God and hearken to his voyce, then you must loue your neighbour as your self. And is thys to loue your neyghbor as your self? to haue your desire with their destruction? to haue your wish with their griefe and woe? and to craue your fonde fancie with their confusion? if you would be called Christians, then doe as it doeth beséeme Christians. And follow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of God knit vp in one short sentence, whiche was spoken by Christe, the Captaine of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And this it is: <hi>Whatsoeuer you woulde that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should do vnto you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 7.</note> 
               <hi>do yee euen so to them.</hi> Now marke I beséech you, if we should racke you, torment you, burn you, and kil you for your religion, I am sure you would not be wel pleased w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs for vsing you so: Then why do you wish and are content that we shoulde be spoyled, burned, or kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Therfore you that are of the Popes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are not of Christs religion, bycause you haue rackt vs, spoyled vs, tormented vs, burned vs, and murthred vs: which you would not haue vs do vnto you.</p>
            <p>Now if your religion be not Christes religion (as these words and your workes haue sufficiently proued:) then I know not whose religion it is, vnlesse it be the diuels reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whose religion must néedes be wicked and euil, for that Christes religion is most holy and good. And thus I haue sufficiently proued vnto you, that the Gospel that we haue is the true law of Christ: And the Pops law that you followe is the false law of the Diuell or Antichrist.</p>
            <p>But if your harts be so obdurate, that no trueth can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the same: Then mark this that followeth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it if you can, or confute it if you are able: If god bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed these his blessings before mentioned, onely vppon that people that hearken to his voyce and obey his worde, (as he hath promised) and if our gracious Quéene, we hir sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, and hir realme, haue had these gods blessings moste
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:9415:27"/>
plentifully poured vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, euer since she hath set forth this our religion, the worde of God, &amp; put away the Masse and Idolatrie: then it is most euident, that this our religion is the true religion of Christ and lawe of God: bycause of the wonderfull blessings that we haue enioyed withall.</p>
            <p>And if God send these plagues and curses before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed only vpon that people that doth not harken to his voice, but disobeyes his lawes and commandementes, &amp; commit Idolatrie (as he hath promysed, &amp; if these Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; their people that obey the Pope and his lawes, that are enimies and suppressors of the word of God, haue day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly these plagues &amp; curses light vppon them: then it is most apparant, that the Popes religion is false, abhominable, and wicked, and that God therewith is highly displeased, bicause of the manifolde plagues and curses that he dayly sendes among them.</p>
            <p>And thus for that God doth blesse vs with his foresayde blessings, and that with such a plentie, quietnesse, peace, and prosperitie as <hi>Englande</hi> neuer tasted before: And bycause diuerse Countreys that obey the Pope and embrace Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie, haue bene, and are yet still compassed and enuironed with the saide plagues and curses of God (that is) warres, troubles, scarcitie, and such like, both we striuing and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our selues for Christians, as did the <hi>Israelites</hi> and the people of <hi>Iuda</hi> that were all Iewes and called the people of God, whereof the Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> and their people, for clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to Gods lawe, were blessed and prospered of God, and the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> and their people, bycause they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Idolatrie and disobeyed the lawe of God, were plagued and cursed of God.) Therefore it cannot be denyed by any, vnlesse they be as senselesse as brute beastes, but that this that we haue is the true Religion of Christ, whereby wée haue our name of Christians, and that Papisticall doctrine which you haue, is a most false and erroneous religion, the professors whereof cannot iustly be called Christians, but rather Antichristians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:9415:28"/>Yet perhaps al this wil not persuade some of you, though it be neuer so plaine and true. But if this and the rest will not allure you to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lye from Papistrie, and to sticke to Gods word. Surely, surely, you are then fully bent to resist the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen &amp; manifest truth. And though therby you willingly cast of God and his word, yet I beséech God that he do not cast you of for euer.</p>
            <p>It may be that some of you wil graunt that Gods word, is true, but that we do mistake it, and that we haue not the true meaning and vnderstanding thereof, so that we misuse it: certainely this I will saye to you, if we do misuse it and mistake it, then God takes his markes amisse, and is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellously ouerséene, that blesses vs so aboundantly that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and misuse his word: and sendes his plagues and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses on those Countries and people, that vse it well, &amp; take it rightly: and so by this it should séeme that God doth directly against his promise.</p>
            <p>But assure your selues, thoughe your presumptuous Pope, and his obedient Prelates may be deceiued, &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séene (as no doubt they are) God and his déere sonne Christ, can neyther be deceyued, nor yet ouerséene, marrye God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersées them all looke they neuer so high.</p>
            <p>Therefore turne to the Lord and to his holy worde, that therefore will blesse and prosper you: and forsake the Pope and his doctrine whereby God doth plague and cursse you: and loue, obey, and thinke well of your most louing, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and mercifull Quéene, that mercifully and myldely doth protect you.</p>
            <p>If you would marke but hir Maiesties power, and knew what she may do, &amp; weighe your owne doyngs, &amp; what you ought to do, truely you would say then that she is the most myldest and mercyfullest Quéene, one of them, that euer raigned.</p>

            <p>Marke wel &amp; weigh aduisedly, I beséeche you, that when King <hi>Alured</hi> did thus daungerously hazard his life for hys Countrey, then thys Realme was vexed and scourged with thrée maruellous plagues, that is, with their enemies the <hi>Danes,</hi> wyth great mortalitie of men, and with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine

of beasts: but now when you séeke or wish for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spoile and confusion of your Countrey, God hath blessed vs with thrée special blessings, that is, with the pure preaching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospell, with a great plentie of al things, and a wonderfull peace, such as this Realme had neuer so long before.</p>
            <p>Consider therefore the good case that now we are in, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euil case our auncesters haue bin in: for this our Realme, was gouerned once vnder diuerse Kings at one time, but by the great policie &amp; worthinesse of our former Rulers, as <hi>Mulmutius, Dunwallo, Aluredus,</hi> &amp; K. <hi>Adelstane</hi> (or rather by Gods power and prouidence) this Realme was brought from the rule &amp; gouernment of seauen Kings at one time, to one <hi>Monarch,</hi> vnder the gouernment of one Prince: but you (if you myght haue your will or wishe) would haue vs to loose our one most quiet and mercifull gouernour, to bée ruled, gouerned, and to bée in bondage and slauerie vnder many tyrants.</p>
            <p>Therefore I may iustly compare you to Uipers: for, as they are conceiued by the deuouring of their fathers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Galen. de Theriaca.</hi>
               </note> and brought forth by the destruction of their mothers, and at laste are destroyed themselues: euen so you goe about as much as in you lyeth, to deuoure your fathers that begot you, to murther your mothers that did beare you, to destroy your wiues that do loue you, to bring your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that obey you, to burne your brethren that benefite you, to suppresse your Prince that defendeth you, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume your Countreymen that should ayde you, &amp; to spoyle your whole Countrey that doth nourish you: which, if you should bring to passe (as God forbid) then looke to haue the rewarde of Uipers your selues, which is, short life and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
            <p>If you cannot sée the good case you are in, I feare you shal féele the euill case you shall be in: for you are like to a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe seruant that dwelleth with a good Maistresse, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gently reproued (not sharply corrected for hir fault) and therefore weary of hir welfare, gets hir a shrewd husbande
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9415:31"/>
in al the hast, who doth not only then lead a sorrowful life, but also would be right wel content with the scrappes she was wonte with hir Maistresse to throw away, and would be glad of simple clothes that before she disdayned: so you being gouerned vnder a merciful Quéene and louing Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse (not séeing your great plentie, quietnesse, and peace you haue by hir) would faine chaunge hir for a cruel cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of the Popes, whose traine woulde make you their slaues, spoyle you of your substance, rauish your wiues, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower your daughters, and cause you to fight against your own friends, murther you, and treade you vnder their féet: (for if their maister the Pope hath trode vppon an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours necke, do you thinke that his seruaunts wil sticke to trample on your backes and bellies? And thus you are far worse to youre selues (thoughe I haue proued you euil y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to vs) than the fonde mayde is to hir selfe: for she for a good mystresse gets but an euil husband, who may by law be compelled to vse hyr better, but you for one moste milde and mercifull Maistresse, woulde haue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sande euill and cruell Maisters, of whom you shal haue no redresse.</p>
            <p>Now to auoyde all these mischiefes before mentioned, cleaue vnto GOD and his worde, cast off the Pope and his Lawes, feare to haue Gods curses, care not for the Popes curses, for euer since the Pope hath curste vs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Malac.</hi> 2.</note> the Lorde God hath blest vs, (with quietnesse, plentie and peace) and they that the Pope hath blessed, it séemes that God hath cursed them, with troubles wars, scarcitie, and many other euils,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mala.</hi> 2.</note> for so the Prophet said I wil curse your blessings.</p>
            <p>If our forefathers that estéemed the Popes blessings so greatly, and dreaded his curses so much, had thought that they should haue bin so happy and fared so wel, as we haue with his curses: and to be so troubled and molested, &amp; haue such mischiefes, (as other haue daylye, with his blessings) they wold neuer haue obeyed him, nor feared him so much
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:9415:32"/>
they did.</p>
            <p>Therefore séeing God doth blesse where the Pope doth cursse, and also cursse where the Pope doeth blesse: it is a very manifest thing, that Gods lawe and the Popes lawe are contrarie, and are not all one, but contrary the one to the other: and so, if the one be true, the other muste néedes be false. But I trust you wil not say, that the law or worde of God is false, then you must néedes be compelled to say, that the Popes lawe is false. Now séeing it is so manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proued, that the Popes lawe is false, I hope you wil not be so wilfull and witlesse, to forsake the true word of God, &amp; follow still the false law &amp; wicked Religion of the Pope.</p>
            <p>Consider I beséeche you, how Christ became curssed, to make you blessed: and will you to be blessed of the Pope, bée curssed of God? and séeing Christe was curssed for our sakes, to leade vs to heauen, will you be curssed of God for the Popes sake, that would bring vs to Hell? Truely whosoeuer beléeueth that Iesus Christ by his death hath performed the whole law for vs, as well as though we had kept it perfectly our selues, and that our saluation is by and through him: whosoeuer I say, beléeue this faithfully, and repent their sinnes vnfainedly, without all doubt they are sure to be saued.</p>
            <p>But whosoeuer thinke that they may merite heauen by their owne workes, or hope to bée saued by some other meanes than by Christ, as by Masses, Trentals, Dirges, Popes pardons, &amp; such trumperie, (which the Popes doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine dooth teach you) let all such be assured, that they shall neuer be without the aforenamed great plagues &amp; cursses of God, héere in this worlde, but shall be damned for euer in hell fire with the Deuill and his wicked Angels, if they doo not repent and turne. And this waie to Heauen by the onely death and passion of Christ, Christ himselfe teacheth in the new Testament, and the other way to Hel, the Pope dooth teach, which is cleane out of the new Testament, and neuer came there. Therefore, how blinde, how senselesse,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:9415:32"/>
and how bewitched are you, that will sticke and cleaue to the Pope and his Law, whereby you shall haue al the saide plagues and Gods cursses in this world, and endlesse dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in Hell after your death? and forsake the worde of God, whereby you should enioy al these Gods wonderfull blessings, in this life, &amp; the kingdome of Heauen after your death? Wherefore you were not best to refuse Gods worde for Papistrie, nor Gods swéete blessings, for his dreadfull cursses, least you lose Christ for the Pope, God for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and Heauen for Hell.</p>
            <p>Marke well besides our happie estate, for whereas di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other Countries haue vnmercifull tirants that spoile, murther and kill their owne obedient subiects, we liue pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably, plentifully, &amp; prosperously vnder a most mild &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Quéene: &amp; wheras our neighbors and diuers countries haue had both forraine &amp; intestine wars, with great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, miseries, and calamities: we haue enioyed a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull peace vnder our blessed Quéene euer since she rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned: And whereas diuers other Countries &amp; our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors haue had great penurie, scarcitie, and hunger, besides the great dearth in Quéene <hi>Maries</hi> time (a time of Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie) when thousandes of this oure countrey were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to eate Swines meate (which was bread made of Acornes) yet we (thankes be to God) haue had great plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and maruelous abundance of all things.</p>
            <p>And whereas diuers Kings of this realme haue called parliament vpon parliament, chiefly for taxes &amp; subsidies, to satisfie their wasteful expences, hir Grace hath proroged hir Parliaments from time to time, as the like hath neuer bin séene in <hi>Englande,</hi> shewing not onely thereby, that shée wil haue no more than she néedes, nor so much as she may, but also that she loues vs so much, &amp; trustes vs so wel, that she thinks our monie is as ready for hir (when she néeds) in our pursses, as in hir owne coffers. All whiche you must graunt (as is before said) to be the great blessings of God,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:9415:33"/>
which God doeth not promise to bestow vpon Heretickes, or that are of a false religion. And God (no doubte) hathe endued vs with all the sayde blessings, for the displacing of the Popes religion, and for erecting his holy Gospel, and for succouring, chearishing, and reléeuing of the poore persecuted members of Christe, that were driuen to flée hither for succour out of their own countrey.</p>
            <p>Therefore I beséech you (once againe) become the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, in hearkening and cleauing to his worde, loue your most merciful and lawful Quéen, in obeying hir Grace, and in embracing hir godlye procéedings, be no more Englishe enimies, but Englishe friendes, and be faithful to your Countrey, and séeke the quietnesse thereof, and be friends to your selues in following of Gods word, as you haue bin your own vtter enimies in embracing the Popes doctrine, and flée to Christ, and shunne the Pope, &amp; trust not to his pardons, nor to his Masse, for they will vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deceiue you, and al them that trust to the same. Loke or wish no more for the altering of religion, nor of our pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable and quiet gouernement, to the taking awaye of our moste mercifull Prince, to the subuersion of this your own natiue country, to our great heauinesse and quietnesse, and to our vtter confusion.</p>
            <p>Let your dayes go that you haue so long hoped for, and yet dayly loke for, least they be turned into darke stormie nightes, no fayrer dayes you can haue, than you haue had.</p>
            <p>Marke what goodlye faire dayes all these hadde that followe: the cruell tormentors of the Christians hoped for a fayre and cleare daye, if they mighte once mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and destroy the Christians that professe Christe and his Gospel in hope wherof, they most cruelly and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously persecuted, murthered and martyred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but what was the good daye they hoped for when it came? was not <hi>DECIV'S, MAXIMINIVS, NERO DOMITIAN, IV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAN</hi> the Apostata, <hi>HERODE,</hi> and all the reste of

            <p>The wicked Iewes, the Pharisies, Scribes, <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> thought they should haue a goodly and a faire day, if they shoulde once putte Christe to death, and didde then thinke to haue destroyed Christes Doctrine for euer: but when they had got all their wils and that they wished for, and had put poore innocent Christ to death: was not their goodly faire day turned into a darke, cloudie, and stormye night?

            <p>If you that are hir subiects do hope that the Pope wyll

blesse you for disobeying your Prince. Then hir Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Quéene, may be wel assured, that God wil blesse hir Highnesse (which is as good as the Popes blessing) for obeying of him in setting forth, maintayning and defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the doctrine of Christ, the lawe of God.</p>
            <p>You may perceiue (if you wil perceiue) by the reasons, arguments, examples and proofes before mentioned, that if the Popes souldiours (that you procure or wishe to come &amp; fight against our Prince, to aide, and helpe you vp with your Masse, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest of the Popes paltry) should get the victorie (whyche the Lord forbidde) yet they would spoile you, kil you, murther you, as they woulde vs (though you be of their religion) and woulde neyther trust you nor suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to beare any rule or be in aucthority: for they would thinke (as they might wel ynough) that you that are false and rebellious to your lawfull, naturall, and most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Princesse and Quéene, that suffreth you to enioy qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly all that you haue, and that dothe preserue you in suche prosperitie, quietnesse, &amp; peace, as neuer any Subiectes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyd before in <hi>England,</hi> would not be true and obedient to them, being forrain, vnlawful, and more straighter rulers, that woulde dayly exact on you, poll and pill you and your liuings, to bring you vnder and in thraldome to them. Whiche when you shoulde féele, then their crueltie would teach you what our Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was: whome nowe hir mildnesse and mercie cannot learne what our Quéene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is. And on the other side, if the Quéenes Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie shoulde vanquishe you and them, then manye of you shoulde be knowne for open Traytors, that nowe are not surmysed to be hir priuie enimies, and so therfore to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, as you were well worthy.</p>
            <p>This were but a verye foolishe and an vnwise matche made of you, for whiche side soeuer should win, you should be sure to loose: and which side soeuer got the victorie, you should be sure to haue the ouerthrow. Therefore giue ouer your wilfulnesse, and be persuaded by reason: cease from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:9415:35"/>
your diuelish deuises, your wicked attemptes, and priuie conspyracies against our most milde and merciful Quéen, and forsake your doctrine of the Pope, and embrace the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, which wil teach you to feare GOD, to beléeue and hope in Christ, to obey your Prince, to loue your brethren, and to be true to your countrey.</p>
            <p>Thus I haue sufficiently prooued you (specially you that are wilfull, obstinate, and determined Papistes) to be not onely English enimies, but also the worst enimies to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> that can be: and how the Pope is moste wicked, and his doctrine false, that you so muche loue and followe: and that our religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is most true, which you abhorre and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande: &amp; that you hate your Prince, enuy hir happy estate, contemne our concorde, desire our destrustion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore séeke your owne sorrow, for that thereby you shal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure God to powre his plagues and cursses on you before mentioned. Al which I haue done by sensible similitudes, by tryed testimonies, by infallible arguments, by euident examples, by ineuitable reasons, and by the sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whyche, if you be wise, you wil wegh, if you be Christians, you wil consider, and if you be of God, you wil regarde.</p>
            <p>But some of you are so addict to your holy Father the Pope, that be a thing neuer so plainelye proued, by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, reasons, proofes, similitudes, examples, learning, &amp; by learned Doctors, and Writers, yea, and by the moste holy Scriptures, yet you wil not beléeue it, vnlesse it bée allowed or confirmed by the Pope, who you think can not erre nor lye, and therefore of all other to be trusted, and al other (besides him and his Chaplains) to be mistrusted.

            <p>Is not this a goodly large, and friendly pardon think you? yea it is suche a pardon as Christ neuer graunted, neyther in nor out, nor beside the yeare of <hi>Iubilie.</hi>

            <p>This is suche a way to make <hi>Rome</hi> so ful of fooles, that there wil be no roume for wise men.</p>
            <p>Here we may sée, that if one be confessed of a Priest, and take but his iorney towardes <hi>Rome,</hi> (thoughe he dye by the waye, and neuer come there) the Aungels muste néedes (by the Popes commaundement) carrye his soule to Paradise, (if they wil doe so muche at his bidding) and they shall bée frée from the paines of Hell.</p>
            <p>Al the Scriptures (I am sure) haue not shewed vs such a way to come to Paradise, and to auoyde the paines of hel, as this Pope <hi>Clement</hi> hathe done. He was a milde and a mercifull Pope I warrant him, he hadde not his name for naught. Thus the Pope hath set Christ to schoole, for Christ saith:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 5.</note> 
               <hi>Blessed are the poore in spirite, for theirs is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen,</hi> &amp; also he saith <hi>Blessed are they whiche suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer persecution for righteousnesse sake, for theirs is the kingdome of Heauen:</hi> nay sayeth Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> I knowe
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:9415:37"/>
an easier waye to Heauen, and to escape the fire of Hell, than that, for whosoeuer goeth to <hi>Rome,</hi> or else dyeth in his iourney going thyther, being confessed of a Priest, he shall be absolued from all his sins, and the Angels shal cary his soule straight to Paradise, and no paine of Hell shal touch him.</p>
            <p>Indéede this is a verie easye waye to Paradise and to escape the fire of Hell, if we maye beléeue the Pope, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye when he telleth a lye) I maruaile that neyther <hi>Moyses,</hi> the Prophetes, Christe himselfe, nor his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did reueale this waye to escape the fire of Hell, and to enioye Paradise: truely either they were verye forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or else they knewe not so muche of Gods secretes, as this Pope <hi>Clement</hi> did, or else they had not such an inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wit to prouide a remedie for a mischiefe, as he had.</p>
            <p>Wel be it so, but what if one of <hi>Lucifers</hi> diuels by their maisters commaundement shoulde take by force the sayde soule awaye from the Popes Angell, and so in steade of Paradise carrie him to Hell, then the man that was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Rome</hi> on pilgrimage, and dyed by the waye, were in good case, and then the Pope by his pardon, had serued him but a slipperie touch. Howsoeuer he serued him, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pop will so serue them that truste to him and hys pardons, for he promised more than the Angels woulde doe for him.</p>
            <p>For if the Popes hadde the Angels of GOD at there commaundemente, then why did not Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the seauenth commaunde the Angels to come from Heauen, to deliuer him and his Cardinals out of prison and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Acts &amp; Mo. Page.</hi> 161.</note> he caused Pope <hi>Iohns</hi> eyes to be putte out, and after to be throwen into prison, where he was (as some saye) famished, Some saye he was slaine by <hi>Ferru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now you shal haue a verye humble, a merciful, and a godly Pope,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts &amp; Mo.

And this holye Fathers wrath woulde not be pacified,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9415:39"/>
nor suffer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour to rule as Emperour, but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most vnreasonable conditions, which were vnméete for such a worthy Emperour to graunt vnto such a proude presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous prelate: thus you maye knowe these holy Fathers whom they follow, by their fruites.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Hyldebrand</hi> (who might well be called for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilish doings a fyrebrand of hell) was a notable Sorcerer and a Necromancer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Benno. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall.</hi>
               </note> who on a time had forgotte behinde him hys familiar Booke of Necromancie, which hée was wont to carrie commonly alwaies with him: wherevppon, remembring him selfe, entring the port of <hi>Laterane,</hi> he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led two of his most familiar friendes so fetch the Booke, charging them at no hande to looke within it. But they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so restrayned, were the more desirous to open it, and to peruse it, and so dyd. After they had red a little the secretes of the Sathanicall Booke, sodaynely there come aboute them the messengers of Sathan, the multitude and terrour of whom made them almost out of their wittes. At length they comming to themselues, the sprites were instant vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to know wherfore they were called vp, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were vexed? quickely, sayde they, tell vs what you woulde vs to doe, or else wée wyll fall vppon you, if ye retaine vs longer. Then spake one of the young men to them, bydding them goe and plucke downe yonder walles, poynting to certaine high walles there nye to <hi>Rome,</hi> which they dyd quickly. The young men crossing them for feare of the Spirites, scarce recouering themselues, at length came to their maister the Pope.</p>
            <p>Here you may perceiue this holy Pope was a Coniurer of Deuils, some say the Pope hath the holy Ghost at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, but here it appeares that this Pope had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Deuill at his commaundment.</p>
            <p>This holy <hi>Hyldebrand</hi> hyred one to laye great Stones ouer the place where the Emperour vsed to pray,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts &amp; Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numentes pag.</hi> 179.</note> and so to throwe them downe vppon the Emperours head when hée
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:9415:40"/>
was a praying, and so to kyll him: but God so wrought, that the Emperour escaped, and the wicked hyred wretche was killed himself: for as he was busie in remouing a gret and heauie Stone to the place (euen ouer the Emperours head) it broke the planke whereon it lay, &amp; the saide wicked fellow, standing on the said planke, fell downe with the said stone, from the Roofe to the Pauement of the Churche, and with the same stone was dasht all in péeces.</p>
            <p>Was not this a pretie practise for a Pope? he neuer lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it in the newe Testament: nay if hée had applyed that Booke well, he should thereby rather haue vnlearned it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Hyldebrand</hi> on a time asked an answere of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament (his Christ of Bread) thinking bycause it was the body of Christ (as he tooke it) it shoulde haue resolued hym of the thing hée asked, but it woulde not speake (a good cause why, bycause it coulde not, for it had bene a verye straunge thing to heare a Cake speake) and then therefore he threwe it into the fire, and burned it.</p>
            <p>Thus these holy Fathers can make Christ and burne hym when they haue done: but if it had bene the bodye of Christ, it would haue leapt out of the fyre and saued hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. It is no maruell though they burne the holy and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall members of Christ, that burne Christ himselfe.</p>
            <p>Marke further what a true Prophet this holye <hi>Hylde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brande</hi> was: he sayde openly in the Pulpet before diuerse Cardinals and Bishops, that the Emperour shoulde dye or be put from the Empire, and that he shoulde not be able to make aboue the number of sixe Knightes, and thereof hée made hymselfe so sure, that then hée spake also these wordes following, neuer accepte mée for Pope any more, but plucke me from the Altar, if this Prophesie be not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled before the feast of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> next ensuing. But for as much as the sayd Emperour was neither deade, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by that day, but contrarie to this Popes Prophesie, the same Emperour deposed the sayde Pope, and placed an other Pope in his roome called <hi>Clement.</hi> The sayde Pope
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:9415:40"/>
               <hi>Hyldebrand</hi> therefore, (séeyng he woulde néedes bée a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet) he was but a false Prophet, and so not Prophet of God, but the Prophet of the Deuill. So that hereby it plainely appeares, that Popes may not onely erre, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that they haue erred and lyed falsely, yea and are assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Deuils Prophets.</p>
            <p>Also this holy and vertuous Father Pope <hi>Hyldebrand,</hi> iudged to death thrée men before they were conuicte, (or founde or approued guiltie) and caused them to be hanged without delay, contrarie to all Lawe.</p>
            <p>And further, this vnmercifull Father, (for the Popes may not be called cruell) dyd torment one <hi>Centius</hi> almost to death, in a vessell thicke set with sharpe Nayles, which <hi>Centius</hi> after tooke the Pope, &amp; before he was deliuered, he pardoned the said <hi>Centius,</hi> &amp; al them that were on his part: but for all his pardon, he hanged the said <hi>Centius</hi> after, and nine of his men.</p>
            <p>If the Popes pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s be so slender y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he giues on his owne behalfe, then the pardons y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he giues on Gods behalfe, must néedes be of small value. Therefore you were not best to trust to the Popes pardons too much, least after you be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in hell, as <hi>Centius</hi> and his men were hanged on earth.</p>
            <p>This Pope <hi>Hyldebrande</hi> dyd an other déede of mercye: There was at the apprehension of this Pope, a certayne widdowes Sonne, to whom and other moe, for their pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, the Pope enioyned a yeares banishment: which tyme beyng <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ded, the widdowe in token of a more ample satisfaction, (thinking thereby to haue appeased the more the Popes furie) put a halter about hir sonnes necke, and drawing hir Sonne by the rope to the foote of the sayde holy <hi>Hyldebrand,</hi> sayd, my lorde Pope, at your handes will I receyue agayne my Sonne, which one whole yeare hath endured banishment and other pennaunce, by your holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse enioyned. Then the saide <hi>Hyldebrand,</hi> for that instant bycause of those that were with him in companye (dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his wrath) deliuered hir sonne churlishly, saying, get
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:9415:41"/>
thée hence woman I byd thée, &amp; let me bée in rest. After this he sent his officers, and apprehended the (sayde) widdowes sonne, &amp; gaue commaundement to the Iustices to put him to death, who altogether making answere, saide, that they coulde no more condemne or meddle with him, for that hée had for his crime committed, appealed once to the Pope, and abidden the banishment, and done the pennance by him enioyned. Herevpon this glorious <hi>Hyldebrand,</hi> being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with the Iudges, caused y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foote of the said widdows sonne to be cut off, notwithstanding he had fulfilled all that was enioyned him by the saide Pope before. And thus hys foote being cut off, he died within thrée dayes after.</p>
            <p>All you that woulde learne equitie and iustice, learne here of the Pope. I coulde neuer reade, that Christe after he bad the woman that was taken in adoultrie, goe awaye and sinne no more:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8.</note> that eyther he commaunded the Iudges to put hir to death, or else caused hir foote to be cut off.</p>
            <p>Are not these mercifull and charitable actes and doings of the Popes, sufficient testmonyes, to make vs beléeue, that they are Christes Uicars, and menne of God? surely they haue verye harde heartes, that thereby wyll not bée wonne, to loue, honor, and estéeme the Pope, and to kysse his féete.</p>

When he was but a Cardinall, he smote Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> with his fifte, and layd him in prison: he poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sixe Popes his predecessors, to make a way for himself to be Pope: He was a Coniurer, and a rayser of Diuells, and in his furie he threw the Sacrament into the fire as is before declared.</p>
            <p>Was not this (trowe you) a very fitte fellowe to be the Uicar of Christ? nay, he was more méete to be a deputie for the diuell, as he was in déede. Yet for al these his detestable doings, one Doctor <hi>Harding</hi> that lately was a Proctor for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:9415:41"/>
the Pope, was not ashamed to write, that this Pope <hi>Hyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand</hi> was a holy and vertuous man. Truly, if this was a holy Pope, then the worlde is full of holie and vertuous people.</p>
            <p>The holy acte for Priests chastitie, and to liue without wiues, and that all married Priestes should put away there wiues, was first aucthorized and established by this vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy Pope: the fruites that this law hath brought, were sufficient ynough to knowe the goodnes of him that first made it, though his conditions &amp; maners had not bin mencioned.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, a good &amp; holy man (I warrant you) saide, If Christ the sonne of God,<note place="margin">

            <p>Christe saith, he came <hi>to saue that was lost</hi>: But this Pope came to lose that Christe hath saued.</p>
            <p>This is ynough (I thinke) to proue, whether this Pope was of God or not, was of a right religion or not, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was worthy to be followed of Christians or not.

            <p>If (all this notwithstanding) this Pope were Christes Uicar and an holy and godly man (as you think the Popes cannot be euill) then we shall haue much ado to find out an vnholy or an vngodly man.</p>

            <p>Had not this Emperours sonne a good schoolemaster that taught him to obey his father so well? I neuer heard that <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets, Christ, nor his Apostles, euer taught any mans sonne such a lesson, &amp; to obey their father in this order. Surely the Pope must néedes be a profound fellow, that could find out such misteries for children to obey their fathers &amp; parents, which neither God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, nor Christ euer taught: for he did not only depriue his father, but ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by droue him to great miserie, who after desired to haue but a poore Prebend to serue and sing in the Quéere, but it would not be graunted to him.

            <p>For the Emperour thought belike, that it was as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him to take the Pope prisoner, as to put his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of his kingdome.

            </p>
            <p>Some of you say that this our religion doth giue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to sinne, but these wordes of the Pope doe not séeme greatly to forbid or restraine sin. Saint <hi>Paule</hi> saieth, that <hi>neyther whoremongers nor fornicatours shall enherite the kingdome of Heauen.</hi> But I neuer heard, that either he or Christ said, that they that rub their hands togither, shal not inherite the kingdome of heauen: &amp; therfore rubbing of our hands togither, is no sin: but Whoredome is a great sin, if the Scriptures be true: therefore the Pope is a most wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked liar, to saie, that is no sinne, that God, Christ, and the Apostles called sinne. And as here he cals whoredome no sinne, which is a great sinne: so in other places the Popes call that a great sinne, which Christ doth not cal sinne. And thus you may sée plainly, that the Pope is both in his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and doings cleane contrarie to Christ: therfore if you followe the Pope, you are then contrarie to Christe, and so no true Christians.</p>

            <p>Therfore I would aduise you to lay hold on Christ and his Apostles, which are no chaungelings, and forsake these wicked Popes whiche are suche chaungelings, for I will neuer truste them, nor fauour their religion, vntil they be more vertuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> godly, and honest, and agrée better among themselues than they do.</p>

And also the Pope hath made it Heresie (though Christe did not make it) for a king not to holde his kingdome at his handes: It is happy that he named no Quéenes, for if he had putte the Quéenes as wel as he put in kings, then haply he mighte haue made the Quéens maiestie also one of his Heretiks.</p>
            <p>The Pope, if we may credite his prerogatiue, being of his owne penning, is of no small power: For he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

I thinke, that none of you doe beléeue, that the Pope can doe as God can doe, for I am sure, that God can, and will, burne all the worlde at once, yea, and that quickly, whiche I am sure the Pope can not do, for if he could, then al they that professe Gods word, should be burned ere to morrowe, nay within this houre: besides he would do then many other things, that he can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doe: but thoughe the Pope cannot doe whatsoeuer God can doe, yet I will helpe hym a lyttle: he can doe more than God can doe, for hée can blaspheme God, he can lye, he can hate them that loue him, he can hurte them that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer offended him, hée can be vnmercifull, he can breake his promise, hée can saye, that hée can doe more than hée can doe, hée can bée a false Harlot, hée can bée the chylde of the Dyuel, he can bée Antichriste, and he can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce himselfe higher than he ought to be, al whych God can not doe.

               </note> as <hi>Siluester Prierias</hi> doeth write: Then when Christ shal sit in iudgemente at the laste daye, and hathe seuered the Shéepe from the Goates, and bidde the blessed Shéepe to come into the kingdome of heauen, and sente the curssed Goates into Hell, the Pope maye come in then by hys aucthoritie, and say to Christ, by your leaue sirra a little, séeing you haue giuen iudgement by your lawe, I will nowe giue defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue sentence by my lawe, (whiche is more than Gods worde.) And then the Pope maye say: Come backe againe yée curssed that Christ bad to go to Hell, and looke that yée go into Heauen, for I haue appointed it for you to dwell in: and you blessed that Christe hath willed to goe into Heauen, come backe againe or I wil fetche you, and sée that you goe into Hell, for that is the place that I haue appointed for you to dwell in.

and sende the godly to Hel, and the wicked to Heauen, and he himselfe to be in Heauen like a God, that liued on the earth like a Diuel.</p>
            <p>What Hel-houndes are these that would make vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, that the Popes power and aucthoritie is more than the word of God. But if the Pope in a maner can do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God can doe, or, if he haue all power giuen hym in Heauen and in Earth (as he sayeth) then why did Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight suffer <hi>Scaira</hi> wyth his souldiours to set fire on the gates of his pallaice,<note place="margin">

And why then did he suffer them to sette him on a wilde and vnbroken colte, with his face towardes the horsse tayle, and the colte to runne vp and down with him vntil he was almost breathlesse? and why did he suffer himselfe to be imprisoned by the sayde <hi>Scaira</hi> thrée dayes, and to be almoste famished for meate? thys holye Father that coulde commaunde the Angels to carry mens soules to Heauen, I maruell that he did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande them to come out of Heauen, to deliuer him out of prison, and out of his enimies handes. But be bolde he woulde haue done it if he coulde haue done it. And therefore you maye perceiue that he promiseth you more by hys Pardons than he is able to performe: for if the Pope hath suche power to pardon you, and to forgiue you your sinnes, and to sende your soules by Aungels to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: then the Pope woulde haue helped himselfe out of prison and thraldome. Therefore you maye sée (if you wil sée) that he tels you, that he can doe a greate deale more than he can do: for if he coulde deliuer mens soules from Hel, he were able to deliuer his owne bodye out of prison.

            <p>And thoughe the Pope hathe suche greate and high au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cthoritie as he hath, he claimeth it not but by the aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Scriptures, or by excellente and learned argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.

But who taughte the Pope so childishlye to playe with similitudes, thereby to aduaunce himselfe, and to abase the Emperour of the Worlde? who tolde him, that the Pope is the Sunne, and the Emperour the Moone? or that the Emperour is so farre inferior to the Pope, as the Moone is inferior to the Sunne?

If Christ made <hi>Peter</hi> Pope &amp; gaue him all this authoritie bicause he followed Christ, then the Pope is a false Pope and hath no such authoritie, bicause he hath cleane forsaken Christ, &amp; followes him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a whit: Marry if <hi>Peters</hi> sléeping and bicause he coulde not watch with Christ made him Pope, and therby had all this great authoritie: then I will not denye but the Pope may be a Pope aswell as <hi>Peter</hi>: for he sléepes in all kind of sinne, &amp; he watches neuer a whit with Christ. And as <hi>Peter</hi> did not preach Gods word all the while he slept, so it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res that the Pope sléepes alwayes, for he neuer preaches. And if <hi>Peters</hi> fighting and the cutting off of <hi>Malchus</hi> eare, made him Pope and got him such authoritie: then I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the Pope is a right and perfect Pope, for he doth fight as fiercely as <hi>Peter</hi> did for his life, &amp; whereas <hi>Peter</hi> did cut off the eare of one, the Pope cuttes off the heads &amp; burnes

the bodyes of thousandes. And whereas <hi>Peter</hi> dyd fighte with Christes enemie but kylled him not: the Pope doeth fight with Christes friends &amp; killes them out-right. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if <hi>Peters</hi> fighting made him Pope, then the Pope is a ryghte Pope as well as hée. But it is not to bée founde in all the newe Testament, that Christ eyther called <hi>Peter</hi> the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> or gaue hym any such authoritie as the Pope claymes by <hi>Peter.</hi> I finde (as I said before) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ called <hi>Peter</hi> Sathan or Diuell, but hée neuer called hym Pope.</p>
            <p>Marry if Christ had sayde these wordes to <hi>Peter, Peter</hi> thou shalt bée Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all that shall succéede thée in that seate shal be Popes, and shall neuer erre saye or doe what they wyll, I giue to thée and them all my power in Heauen and in earth: thou &amp; they shall be aboue Emperors and Kings, &amp; shalt treade in their neckes &amp; put them downe and put other in their places when thou &amp; they liste: Thou and they shall be called God, and shal in a manner do what soeuer God can do: and thou and they shal haue one place or seate of iudgement with me: you shall haue power to giue the Scriptures what vnderstanding and sense you list: thy authoritie and theirs shal be aboue the Scriptures or word of God: and you shal haue power to commaund the Angels of Heauen to come downe to the Earth, and to carry whose Soules you list to Heauen: And whosoeuer shall haue your pardons, (what offence so euer they haue done, or howe wickedly soeuer they die) they shal be forgiuen: and as soone as they are deade, they shall goe to heauen, &amp;c. If Christ (I saye) had sayde these wordes to <hi>Peter</hi> as plainely as he said <hi>Come after me Sathan,</hi> then I woulde haue graunted that <hi>Peter</hi> and all hys successours hadde béene made perfecte Popes, and that therefore Christ had gyuen them a good and large commission. But sure I neuer read that Christ gaue either him or them, al these authorities, or made them such Popes.</p>
            <p>But if euer Christe made <hi>Peter</hi> Pope at all, then true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:9415:56"/>
I thinke he made him Pope and all his successours, with all the priuiledges before mentioned, and a great sorte mo, at the same time when he called hym <hi>Sathan,</hi> or named him <hi>Diuell,</hi> whych Popedome and priuiledges belonging ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (as the Popes vse them) is so fitte an office for Sathan the Diuell to execute: that if al the world had deuised, they could not haue inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted a fitter office for him. Well, though the Pope holde not his Popedome and his power by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, yet at least he kéepes it by custome. Therefore hée will be a God, who euer sayes nay, for as he saith, he hath all power in Heauen and in Earth.</p>
            <p>But though he haue al the power in Heauen and earth, and ouer the Angels in Heauen, yet Hel is lefte out as hap is, so that it séemes he beares no swaye there. Therefore let the Pope take héede, least he come there among the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Diuels, for though he rule on Earth, the Diuell wyll bée ruler in Hell: it were a foule ouersighte of the Pope to goe to Hell, and to be ruled of the Diuels, that nowe doth rule both Angels in Heauen and men in earth. Wel, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the Pope hath gotten his authoritie, he hath it, and will holde it as long as he can, and if these two pillers will stay him, he meanes to sit stil in his seate.

and by other infallible argumentes, that wée haue the true religion, and how that God therefore hath and doth pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and blesse vs: I haue proued also, that the Popes whom you so much loue and leane to, haue béene moste wicked Murtherers, Coniurers, Aduouterers, Heretikes, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, Idolators, Sacrificers to Diuels, and Dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators of Christs benefites, hys death and passion, and that they are the enimies of God, the children of the Diuel, yea, and the verye Antichrist.</p>

            <p>Perhappes some of you maye saye, thoughe the Pope be wicked &amp; euil, and thoughe he be proued to be Antichrist, yet this religion that you and your fore-elders haue hadde &amp; vsed, is not therefore euil, nor to be despised: to whome I answere, if the trée be euil, the fruite cannot be good: can the Diuel sette forth a godly religion? no, it is agaynste his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: then, can the Pope which is of the Diuell, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Antichriste, sette forth the pure worde of God? no, it is impossible, for as the euil fruit doth shew the trée to be euil: so the detestable doings, &amp; wicked religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Pope, shewe him to be wicked and of the Diuell:<note place="margin">

            <p>But bycause I wil leaue nothing vndone, that may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure you not onely from the Pope, but also from his pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous religion, I will (God willing) prooue the chiefest pointes of Papistrie that you stand vppon, both by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, auncient Doctors, and by naturall reason, to be false, most wicked, and abhominable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:9415:60"/>And bycause one parte of the Popes religion whiche is worshipping of Images<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is mentioned before among the cursses of God, and therefore abhominable vnto the Lorde, and directly against the second commaundement, therefore I will firste beginne with it, not doubting, but that many of you doe not so much regarde and estéeme the worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or hauing of Images, though some of you are déepely and superstitiously giuen thereto.</p>
            <p>And first let vs heare what God said to <hi>Moses</hi> therein, and in his lawe:<note place="margin">

            <p>Nowe, bicause your Papistrie permitteth Images, and your papistical Churches are al ful of Images and Idols, and bicause you bowe downe vnto them, knéele vnto them, go on pilgrimage vnto them, and pray vnto them, therfore your religion is cleane contrarie to this lawe of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the first Table of <hi>Moses,</hi> and therefore moste wicked and abhominable, which deserues &amp; procures Gods great plagues, cursses, and vengeance. And the yongest chylde that is, if hée haue eyther read aught, or learned aught, knowes that to estéeme, reuerence, or worship Images, is euill and wicked, and against the commandement of God, so that your religion of Papistrie, in this poynt muste néedes be euill, wicked, and abhominable, as is aforesayd, and the Pope and his Prelates doo not onely suffer and permit them in Churches, but also maintaine them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende

            <p>And that you may the better perceyue howe readye the holy Ghost is to come among these holy harlots, (Prelates I shoulde saye) at these their holy Counselles: Marke wel this that followeth:<note place="margin">

If this be true that the Trueth is so fastened to the Chayre, I feare then that some haue stolne that true Chayre awaye, and haue set a chaire of falshood in the place of it, for surelye all the Popes haue had such lucke that haue of a long time sitten in that Chayre at <hi>Rome,</hi> that they haue told nothyng but lyes: woulde not that Chaire that was so ful of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and truth, make any desirous to steale it, and carry it awaye? for if the Pope were neuer so false, by and by as soone as he got himselfe into that Chaire he could not erre: For then he coulde saye nothing but trueth. But as soone as the Pope was gone out of that holy chaire, he left al the truth behinde him in the Chaire, and carried none awaye with him. If the Pope were neuer so vnlearned, and could not construe hys owne name, by and by as soone as he did once sit in that chayre, hée was the greatest Doctor in both lawes that was in the world, all knowledge was then crept into the Popes bosome, or breast: oh, if eyther the studentes of Gods law or mans lawe had such a chaire of Uertue as this Popes Chaire is, to sitte in, then they shoulde not néede to take suche paines in studying nyghte and daye as they doe.

            <p>Therefore consider and marke well (though euen nowe to serue their turne, the Scripture of them is called holye) in what estimation and reuerence the Popes Prelates haue the holy Scripture and word of God, and howe they extoll their Romishe Churche. <hi>Ludouicus</hi> a Canon of the Churche of <hi>Laterane</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> saith thus, <hi>The Church</hi> (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Church of <hi>Rome) is the liuely breast of Christ.</hi>

                  <hi>Iewel in def. Apolog.</hi> 552.</note> 
               <hi>But the Scriptures is as it is nowe deade Inke.</hi> The Byshoppe of <hi>Poyters</hi> sayde, <hi>the Scripture is a dead and a dumbe thing, as are all other politike lawes. Albertus Pighius</hi> sayeth, <hi>if thou saye these matters muste be putte ouer to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Scriptures, thou shewest thy selfe to be voyde of common reason: for the Scriptures are dumbe Iudges and can not speake. Eckius</hi> calleth the Scriptures, <hi>The blacke Gospell:</hi> and the <hi>Inken Diuinitie. Pighius</hi> agayne sayeth, <hi>The Church</hi> (that is the Church of <hi>Rome) hathe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to giue Canonicall authoritie vnto certaine writings whiche otherwise they haue not, neither of themselues nor of their Authors:</hi> and thus may the Pope by his aucthority allowe anye booke of the Scriptures, and so he may make Scriptures.

            </p>
            <p>Thus they teache the people to reuerence and estéeme the holy Scripture Gods worde, they cal it deade Inke, a liuelesse letter, a dumbe Iudge that can not speake, a blacke Gospell, Inken Diuinitie, a nose of waxe, &amp; a thing vtterlye voyde of aucthoritie of it selfe.

This fellowe belike takes his own word for a warrant, for he brings neither Scripture, nor auncient Doctor to confirme his sayings.

            <p>But perhappes you wil not beléeue me though I haue sufficiently proued it by the Scriptures, vnlesse I shewe you some authorities out of ancient Doctors. If you looke that the Doctors ought to confirme the Scriptures, then you are wide, for the Scriptures must confirme and allow the Doctors. But to satisfy you withall, I wyl alleadge the Doctors, who you shall sée wyl agrée with me, that the Scriptures must allowe the Churche, and that the right Church is knowne by the Scriptures: and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer refuseth to bée tryed by the Scriptures, is not of the right Church, nor of the church of God.</p>

They that worship God aright &amp; follow Christes Gospel, wil &amp; do detest such diuellish doctrine. Therefore flie from this Romish Church, that taketh the Pope to be hir heade, and that refuseth to be tried by the Scriptures, and spéedily become members of that Churche that taketh Christ to be hir heade, and is content to bée iudged by the Scriptures. For they that are of Christ will heare his voyce, which is the Gospell, which true Church (wherof Christ is the head) can not be knowne, but by the Scriptures.</p>

the Churche in our owne wordes, or in the wordes of hir heade, which is our Lorde Iesus Christ? In my iudgement wee ought rather to seeke the Churche in his wordes for that he is the trueth and best knoweth his owne body.</hi> And agayne he sayeth, <hi>Let vs not heare these wordes, this say I, This sayest thou, but these wordes let vs heare, Thus sayth the Lorde: there let vs seeke the Churche: there let vs dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse our cause.</hi> And <hi>Saint Ambrose</hi> sayeth, <hi>the Church shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth (or is knowne) not by hir owne light, but by the light of Christ, which is the word of God.</hi>

            <p>But what if these auncient and learned Doctors had not written thus? shoulde wée then haue taken that for the Churche of God, which the Popes doctrine doeth allowe? then we shoulde haue a trimme and holy Church, as by the premysses doth appeare.</p>
            <p>And nowe bicause nothing can describe which is the true Church better than Christ himselfe, which is the head ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: therfore let vs searche the scriptures for the same, and there we shal be best certified.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Petrarcha</hi> calleth <hi>Rome</hi> a Schoole of errour, and a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Heresie. <hi>Brigitta</hi> whose Prophesies and sayings are of the Popes Schollers and Disciples muche reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, saieth in hir <hi>Reuelations: Christe shall take his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the Cleargie of Rome, and shall gyue the same to a people that shall doe his will.</hi> Then by hir sayinges and the other before recited, the Pope and hys Prelates doe not Gods will, and so if they doe not Gods will, then they muste néedes do the Diuels will, so that by these (and by many other) the trueth is a straunger in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and dwelles not there.</p>
            <p>And whereas some saie that the trueth can not departe from the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> it had néede to be there first, before it departe from thence: therefore the trueth can not departe from the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> bycause it is not there. But that holy Churche for all their bragges loue the trueth so well, that yf they had it there, they would driue it awaie from thence. And now bycause the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not the trueth, but is a Churche of all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse and errour, as I haue sufficiently prooued bothe with Argumentes, Scriptures, Doctors, yea and by the Popes themselues and other of the same Churche: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I beséeche you come awaye from that whoorishe Church the seate of Antichrist, and flie to the true Church, whiche embraceth and obeyeth the Gospell, and that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the voyce of Christe: least you bée partakers of hir wickednesse, whose destruction is not farre off. And trust not to them neyther beléeue them, that saie the truth is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the truth shall neuer departe from thence.</p>
            <p>Yf truth &amp; falshood may dwell togither or be both at once
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:9415:75"/>
in one place, then I will not saie but that your Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> may haue the truth, but thy are such enimies, that it is very seldome or neuer séene, and though the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> had the trueth, (as it is manifestly prooued it hath not) yet it had néede to haue a very strong commission to tie the trueth so harde to it, that it shoulde neuer departe thence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hierusalem</hi> was once a holy Cittie, and the Temple of God was placed in the same, wherein hée appeared and shewed his Maiestie and reuealed his will, in which Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, King <hi>Salomon</hi> that buylded it thought the Lord would dwell there for euer, and that there should be his house and his Churche: yet now God hath lefte both that Cittie of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and the Temple, &amp; suffred them to be destroyed and ouerthrowen: now if God hath departed from and left <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and the holy Temple which he himselfe appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be buylded to be his house for himselfe, and wherein he appeared and reuealed his will and pleasure: then there can be no great warrantie made, but that he and the truth may departe from, and forsake the Cittie and Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he neuer called his Cittie, neyther appointed any Temple or Churche there to be buylded for him to dwell in, neyther euer appeared there and reuealed his will to his Prophetes and seruants as he did in the Temple of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> which Cittie of <hi>Rome</hi> was first buylded with murther, continued with murther, and maintayned with murther: where in is the Churche of couetousnes, the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of pryde, the Castell of crueltie, the boothes of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelrie, the Innes of Idolatrie, the mansion of mischiefe, the houses of Harlotrie, and the dungeon of all Diuelish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and iniquitie. Therefore it is verie harde to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that the truthe shall neuer departe from this your Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> vnlesse you meane that the trueth can not departe from thence bycause it is not there, or neuer wil be there.</p>
            <p>By this vndoubted assertion it should séeme that you
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9415:75"/>
haue bound Christe in some great bond or statute Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, that he beyng the trueth shall not departe from the Pope, but it were more méete that the Pope were bounde not to departe from Christe.</p>
            <p>Therefore seing the truth hath departed, from <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and the Temple there which was the Cittie and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, where he was content to appeare and reueale his will to his people. Then the truth may well departe from <hi>Rome,</hi> (if it were there) which God neuer chosed for his Cittie, neyther euer appeared there in any Temple, nor appointed any house there to be buylded for him as he did in <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet we may boldly affirme that the truth was once in <hi>Rome</hi> and the Gospell of Christe was there embrased, and then there was the Churche of God? but now of a long time, it hath not had the truth (as before it appeares) but is the enimie to the truth and forsakes and driues from them the trueth that is the Gospell. Therefore <hi>Rome</hi> is not nowe the Churche of God, but the Synagoge of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</p>
            <p>Yet Doctor <hi>Harding</hi> did write that the Churche that nowe is (meaning the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi>) and the Churche that was in the olde time is one Churche:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In his confut. of the Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of the Church.</hi>
               </note> as the man in his olde age is the same he was in his youth. I graunt herein that Maister <hi>Harding</hi> saies true, but though hée be the same man, yet the same man may be an honest man in his youth, and a false harlot in his age. Euen so your Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> when shée was yong, she was godly, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, and was a true spouse to Christe hir husbande: but now your Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> in hir olde age, is become wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, dishonest, and false to Christe hir husbande, and is a verie vnshamefast whore, and an aduoutresse, and goeth a whooring, worshippes Images, and committes Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</p>
            <p>And as the learned Maister <hi>Iewell</hi> late Bishop of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisburie saith thus vpon the same,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iewel in defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Apo. pag.</hi> 632.</note>

full: and the same Moone Eclipsed is one Moone. Euen so a man well aduised, and the same man starke madde, is one man: Euen so the house of God and a caue of theeues is one house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the same Master <hi>Harding</hi> was so farre in loue with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he thought it to be so holie &amp; true, that all other Churches ought to receyue their truth and light from it, and would not haue it dayed or Iudged by the Scriptures or by any other thing, but that all other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ought rather be daied &amp; iudged by the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; thought she was too old &amp; ancient to be controlled in these daies, either of God, Christ, or of the Scriptures. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he saith thus as followeth: <hi>Our doctrine</hi> (meaning the doctrine of the Pope and of the Churche of <hi>Rome) hath had too high a teacher,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iewel in defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Apo. pag.</hi> 639.</note> 
               <hi>to be tried by me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now, it hath bene ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued too lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to be put in daying in these daies at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the world.</hi> Thus much saieth he of the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> thinking she is too true, honest, and auncient, to come to triall or to be put to daying.</p>
            <p>But I say, he that refuseth triall of his matter, doubtes belike that it is not very good: he that standes so much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his honestie, and will refuse to be tried by his neighbors, may be thought to be scant an honest man, &amp; so the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> refusing to be tried by the Scriptures and by the worde of God, (which is as honest, as true, and as auncient as she is, I am sure), doubtes the truth of hir cause, and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects hir owne honestie.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iewes</hi> doctrine was once the doctrine of God, and the auncientest &amp; truest of al other, &amp; they the people of God, &amp; it was long before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gospel which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of Christ, yea and before the Popes holie religion, or the Romish doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: yet for all that, the Iewes now are not the people, seruantes, nor the true Churche of God. Who might now say thus (aswell as the Popes proctors &amp; a great deale bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) Our law hath bene approued too long to be put in day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in these daies at the latter end of the worlde.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:9415:76"/>I trust you would not thinke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saying were sufficient to ouerthrowe your Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> although it might well inough. It is not the auncientnesse, but the truth of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that ought to be allowed or accepted.<note place="margin">

            <p>The Heathen may say (by as good reason) our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of Idolles beyng long before the religion of the Christians, hath bene approued and vsed too long by our auncestors to be put in daying in these dayes in the latter end of the worlde.</p>
            <p>The Diuell was before the worlde began, and fell from Heauen for his pryde, a great while before God did sette foorth his lawe eyther by <hi>Moses</hi> or else by Christe: Yet I trowe, that pryde is not therefore to be allowed to be good. The Diuell might likewise say, my law of pryde began so long agoe, yea before the worlde was created or made, and hath bene allowed, approued, and vsed by many great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peroures, Kings, yea and Popes, Cardinals, and Byshops, and many other, too long, to be put in daying in these daies at the latter ende of the world. But whereas the murther of <hi>Caine,</hi> the Idolatrie of the Heathen, and the pryde of the Diuell began long before Christe, yet the Pope and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion began long and many a day after Christ, as plainly appeares. Therefore seing the murther of <hi>Caine,</hi> the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie of the Heathen, and the pryde of the Diuell, that are so ancient and so long before Christ, may be put to daying: then the Popes authoritie &amp; his new Romishe religion that began so long after Christ, (wherein murther, Idolatrie, &amp; pride beares such a sway) may aswel be put to daying, &amp; be brought to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt.

            <p>As all earthly Emperours &amp; Kinges haue their statutes &amp; lawes for the obeying of them &amp; the maintenance of the countrey &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth: so hath Christ the sonne of God his statutes &amp; lawes for them that be his people the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, thereby to obey their Captaine Christe, &amp; to do these

things that may conserue them all togither here in a holye congregation, and that maye leade them the waye to the kingdome, where their head King &amp; Captaine in Christ is.</p>
            <p>But as they that wil not suffer the lawes of their Kings or Emperours to be read &amp; published to their people, (but will hyde them, destroy them, and burne them, bycause they should not obey their Emperours and kings, and that they should not do their things that should be for the prosperitie, concord, and continuaunce of their Countrey and common wealth) are no true subiectes of those Kings or Emperours (but rather rebels and traytors:) Euen so the Pope and the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> are not the true children nor Churche of Christe (but rebels and Traytors to him) that hydes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes, and burnes the Scripture, Gospell, &amp; Gods worde, bycause we shoulde not knowe our duetie to oure Christe, and that we shoulde not kéepe his commaundements.</p>
            <p>Perhappes some of you wil saye, if the Popes be so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, their doctrine so detestable, and the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> so contrary to Christe (as is here alleadged) then why doth the Emperour and diuers Kings, and so manye Rulers in Christendome followe him, and do not espie his diuelish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Mary I wil tel you why they do not: forsooth bicause they looke not in the worde of God, whych is the only Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle that woulde make them to sée, and so without it they are blinde: therefore the Pope doth suppresse it, burnes it, and hydes it, and falsely expoundes it, and makes them beléeue it is Heresie to be in their vulgare and knowne tongue, and all bycause he woulde not haue them to sée, that he maye leade them by the noses whiche waye he liste: for the Pope is assured, that if the Kings and Rulers that are the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his religion, did once know the Scriptures, and had them in their vulgare tongue, as oure gracious Quéene of <hi>England</hi>

But séeing these holy Fathers &amp; Popes (who you do so reuerence, and whose lawes you so loue,) did not learne these Luciferlike doings of Christ nor of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:

then surely they must néedes learne them of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, who will reward them one day (if they haue not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) for learning his lessons so well, and for putting that in practise, that he taught them. If the Pope did not meane to kéepe the people in blindnesse &amp; errour, what reason shoulde then leade him to kéepe the Scriptures from them, and not to haue the same in their vulgar tongue?</p>
            <p>You sée that children &amp; schollers are suffered to haue rules in their owne tongue that they vnderstande, to make them Gramarians: they that learne Arithmetike are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue the Rules of that science, in the tongue they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande to make them Arithmeticians: they that studie Geometrie are permitted to haue the same in such a tongue as they vnderstand, that they may become perfect Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians: they that desire to learne Phisicke are suffered to studie the same, in the tongue they vnderstand, wherby they may be perfect Phisitions: &amp; so of all other Sciences. And shall not wée then that professe Christianitie, be suffered to haue the lawe of Christ, to looke on the lawe of Christ, and studie the law of Christ in that tongue that we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand? whereby we may become perfect Christians? Nay we haue more néede that meane to be Christians, to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of Christ in our mother tongue that we vnderstand: than they that studie any other Sciences. For the sciences that they studie, can but make them Doctors to maintaine them here to liue a while: but our lawe of Christ (if we stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die it and practise it well) will make vs Saintes, and the sonnes of God, whereby we shall liue in Heauen for euer. And therfore the lawe of Christ which is the Gospell, hath most néede of all other lawes &amp; sciences to be in the vulgar tongue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery one may reade, studie, &amp; vnderstand it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you wil say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not méete for euery one to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, or that it is not méete for euery one to be saued.</p>
            <p>Therefore howe iniuriously and tyrannously doeth the Pope vse the people in taking Gods worde from them that should guide them to heauen, and without which they must
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:9415:79"/>
néedes wander in darkenesse and fall into Hell.</p>
            <p>If many goe out of their way, which they haue gone in a faire bright day: then it is impossible for one to goe right in a darke night, where they knowe not the way, or neuer went before. Wherefore the childe of God will be willing that his brother shoulde haue a torche or a candle to guyde him in the darke. Then may not he be called the child of the diuell, that doth put out the candle or torche purposely, that his neighbour hath in his hand, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lighting of him home in the night, and leades him a wrong waye in the darke, whereby he falles into a ditch and is drowned? yes truely, and none will iudge the contrarie.</p>
            <p>Then must the Pope néedes be a most cruell and diuelish Tyrant, that pluckes the light of Gods word from vs, that should guide vs to heauen, &amp; so leades vs in the darke out of our way into the déepe pit of Hell, where we shal be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned both body and soule. For he doth not onely burne Gods worde, but also burnes them that haue it in their hands, to light them withall, and to guide them in this darke worlde, to the kingdome of Heauen.</p>
            <p>Perhaps some of you will say, that we doe belye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope, for he suffereth vs to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scriptures in Latine. Yea mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but that is euen as though one should take the burning candle out of the launtorne, and suffer the launtorne still in our handes: and doe you thinke, that then we shoulde sée to kéepe our way aswell as we did before? No I trowe. Euen so though we should haue the Bible in Latine, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande neuer a worde of Latine, what shoulde we then bée the better for the Bible?</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will say, that your Bishops, Doctors, and Priests would teach vs the right meaning of it, and would leade vs the right way: forsooth that they woulde as they haue done alreadye, and as he that plucketh out the bright lincke out of ones hande, and leades him in the darke into a ditche, and so makes him to be drowned.</p>
            <p>If one ment that I should go right, he would not put out
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:9415:79"/>
the Candel and leade me in the darke: No more the Pope meaneth that we shoulde walke in the right way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that blowes out the Candel of Gods word, and leads vs in the darke which way he list.</p>
            <p>Nay he that is my friende and woulde haue me goe right, wil not only suffer me to haue a linke to light me in my way in the darke, but also he himselfe wil direct me in my waye: Euen so, if the Pope and his Prelates were of GOD, they woulde not onelye suffer the people to haue the word of God in theyr vulgar or known tong that they vnderstande, to guide them in the way: but also they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues would preach Gods word vnto them, and so directe them the right way to heauen.</p>
            <p>Therfore as théeues hate the light, and desire to be in the darke, bycause they woulde not be spyed: so the Pope (bycause he is a spirituall théefe) hates the lighte of Gods worde, and woulde not haue the people to haue it, but kéepes it from them, and suppresseth it: least they by that light, should spye his théeuerie and perfectly perceiue that he is a spirituall théefe. For he knowes that Gods worde is the chiefest lighte of all other, whereby to espye a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall théefe, being well assured, that if they hadde the lighte of Gods worde, that then he coulde neyther robbe them of theyr goods and treasure (as he daylye doeth) ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther woulde they honour, estéeme, or credite him: but take him for a Théefe, a murtherer, the enimie of God, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer of soules, and the very Antichrist (as he is in déed.) And therefore by no meanes he can abyde, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shoulde haue Gods worde openly in theyr vulgar or knowen tongue: for it woulde shewe them, what he is, what he hath bin, and to what slauerie, bondage, and thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he brings them.</p>
            <p>For as the word of God in our English tong, hath vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; reuealed him what he is, and therby out of estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with our Prince &amp; vs here in <hi>England:</hi> Euen so he knoweth well ynough, if the word of God were in al other realmes
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:9415:80"/>
in their vulgar tong, they would then estéeme him no more than we do. And so the Pope (bycause he hides the Gospel and takes it from the people which shoulde chiefely guyde them) hates the light, and so is a spiritual théefe, &amp; Christs enimie.</p>
            <p>Therefore it séemeth, that Christ did not chose his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to be his Uickar: (but the Pope knewe that it was a good way to bring him in credite.) For if kings, rulers, and Lords of the earth (which may be deceiued) do chose as nie as they can, their most dearest and trustiest friendes, to bée their presedents, and deputies: then I am sure that Christ the sonne of God, and the King of all Kings (that can not be deceiued) if he had ment to haue had a general vickar on the earth, woulde haue made one of his dearest and trusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est friendes his vickar, and not his mortal enimie. And therfore the Pope may saye what he wil, but al wise men do sée, that Christ neither takes him for his vickar, nor yet for his Curate. Can he or his chaplaines be the children of God, that prefers ignorance before knowledge? I think not, some of them haue affirmed that ignorance is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of deuotion. O Lord how contrarie are these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both to God and to his son Christ? nay ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Gods word is rather, the mother of mischiefe, the father of falsehoode, the sister of sinne, the son of sedition, the daughter of diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediency, the coosin of conspiracie, and the Captaine of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie.</p>
            <p>Ful wel the Diuel knew that ignoraunce was the next way to bring the Pope to promotion and the people to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction for their ignorance made them thinke, that none but the Pope or his Prelats did know the truth. And their blindnesse did make them beléeue that none did sée perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but he and his pretious Prelates: So that for wante of knowledge of Gods word (which of purpose they kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them) they beléeued that al they spake was true, and that it was the very right way that they did lead them. So that the peoples ignoraunce was the occasion of the Popes cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:9415:80"/>
his credite the cause of his gaine, his gaine the cause of his power, his power th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> cause of his pride, &amp; his pride the cause he made Emperours and Kings his seruauntes, or rather slaues, and thus the ignoraunce of Gods worde, brought the Pope to promotion, the Princes to subiection, and the people to destruction.</p>
            <p>And if you mark wel, you may perceyue that the Popes suppressing and the keeping of Gods worde from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is a manifest argument that he is neither Christs vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kar nor his deputie, nor that he loues Christe. For Christe sayde to <hi>Peter, louest thou mee?</hi> to whome <hi>Peter</hi> sayde, <hi>yea Lorde, thou knowest that I loue thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 21<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> then Christ saide to him againe, <hi>Feede my sheepe, &amp;c.</hi> So that <hi>Peters</hi> loue to Christ, appeared by féeding of Christes shéepe, whiche was not by féeding their bodies with meate and drinke, but by féeding their soules, through preching to them the Gospel. Now if they loue Christe that féede his shéepe, then they must néedes hate Christ that starue his shéepe, neuer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to them at all: And such a one is the Pope, for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer preacheth, therfore he neuer féedes Christs shéepe. Nay besides that, he doth not only trouble, molest, hurt, burne, and kill suche as do or would féede Christes shéepe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hideth, kéepeth backe, and burnes the Bybles and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staments, leaste the people shoulde loke on them and féede themselues.</p>
            <p>So that here it is manifeste that the Pope loues not Christ bycause he féedes not Christes shéepe: And he that loues not Christe muste néedes hate Christe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope being Christes enimie can not be the vickar of Christ.</p>
            <p>And here also is a great contrarietie betwéene <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; the Pope though he claime to be <hi>Peters</hi> successor) for <hi>Peter</hi> loued Christ for that he fed Christs shéepe, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Christ bycause he sterueth his shéepe, yea and also kils his shéepe. So that the Pope doth not succede <hi>Peter</hi> in any thing, vnlesse it be in denying of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:9415:81"/>Here it plainely appeareth, that the Pope maye wel be the Uicar of the Diuel, for Christes Uickar sure he can not be. I am moste certaine that it was Christes wil that hys word should not be kept from any, though it be the Popes will it should be rightly knowen of any. For would Christ haue vs kepe that we neuer heard of, and would he haue vs searche we know not what? no, Christe was neuer so vnreasonable. For Christ sayth vnto vs all, <hi>If you loue me keepe my commaundements,</hi> (that is whatsoeuer he hath willed by his word.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.</note>) But how can we knowe what is his commandements y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we should kéep? if none declare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs? neither read the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our selues, nor yet haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> red vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs? Therfore if our louing of Christ depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kéeping of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we loue him, séeing we can not knowe his commaundements? So that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes kéeping or hurding of Gods word from the people, is the cause they can not kéepe Gods commaundementes: And their not kéeping of Gods commaundements, is the cause they doe not loue him: and their not louing of him is the cause that he hates them, and his hating of them, will be the cause of their dampnation. And thus the Pope is the first worker of the ignorant peoples damnation.</p>
            <p>Christ saith also, <hi>Search the Scriptures for they are they that witnesse of me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.</note> but how can they search the Scripturs that haue not the Scriptures to search, neyther know how to come by them? now if the Scriptures witnesse what is Christes wil and pleasure, and if their searching and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king therein wil shew them how to performe his wil and please him, and the pleasing of him would be the cause of their saluation. Then the Popes hiding and kéeping the Scripturs from them, is the cause they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not heare, read, or search the Scripturs: and not hearing, reading, or sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Scriptures, is the cause they cannot know the wil of Christe, and the not knowing the wil of Christe, is the cause they can not please him: and their not pleasing of him, is the cause they please the Diuel: and the pleasing of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:9415:81"/>
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diuel is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of their da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation. And thus once again, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope is the chief cause of the ignorant peoples da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation.</p>
            <p>Christe saith also: <hi>Blessed are they that heare the word of God and keepe it:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 11.</note> so that they that heare the worde of God and kéepe it not, are vnhappy. Nowe, if all they that heare the worde of God are not happy, then all they that heare not the worde of God muste néedes be vnhappy, (for there are none happy but they that kéepe or folow the word of God,) but howe can they kéepe the word of God, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heare it, nor reade it? Nowe, if the hearing of Gods worde is the cause that they kéepe it, and their kéeping or following of it, is the cause they are happye or blessed: then the Popes restrayning of Gods word fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people, is the cause they doe not heare it: and their not hearing it, is the cause they cannot kéepe or followe it: and their not kéeping or following of it, is the cause they are vnhappy: and theyr vnhappinesse is the cause of their damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And thus that holye Father that names hymselfe the Uicar of Christe, (whome you so muche estéeme, fauour, and honor) the third time is proued to be the chiefe cause of the ignorant peoples damnation, by kéeping them from the worde of God, which is their onely guide to Saluation.</p>

            <p>Christ saith moreouer, <hi>My Sheepe heare my voice,</hi> (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is the Gospel:) Euen so the diuel may say:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.</note> My Goates heare my voice (whych is Papistrie.) Thus it is manifest, that they that heare not the gospel (which his Christs voice) are none of Christes shéepe. Then the tyrannous Pope, &amp; his murthering ministers, that heare not Christes voice, that stop their eares at his voice, that suppresse and burne the Gospel (his voice) that torment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> murther, and kill his shéepe that heare his voice, are none of Christs shéepe. And if they be none of Christes shéepe, then they muste néedes be the Diuels Goates. For there are none, but must néeds be the one of these two: that is, either the shéepe of Christ, or the goates of the Diuell. And truely there is no better marke whereby to knowe Christes shéepe, than by hearing of Christes voice, (whiche is the holy Gospel.) And there is no plainer marke whereby to know the Diuels Goats, than by refusing to heare the Gospel, (which is the voice of Christe.) Therefore, if you entende to be Christes shéepe, then heare the Gospell Christs own voice. But if you had rather be the Diuels Goates, then refuse (as you doe) to heare the Gospell, and care not for Gods Gods worde, but loue and obey the Pope, and followe Papistrie, whych is the voice of the Diuel.</p>
            <p>Here may you plainely perceiue, that the Popes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is, to refuse the Scriptures in the mother tongue, and so not to heare the voice of Christe: therfore they that are of the Popes doctrine, are none of Christes shéepe, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they heare not Christs voice: so that you by the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Gods word, which is Christss voice, you make your selues to be none of Christes Shéepe. Therefore flye from Papistrie, and hearken to the Gospell (the voice of Christe) that you may bée Christes Shéepe, and so to bée placed on the right hande of Christe at the laste day, in the Kyngdome of Heauen. For assure your selues,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:9415:83"/>
if you wil not heare the Gospell, whiche is Christes voice you can be none of Christes shéepe, yet to heare Christes voice is nothing, vnlesse you vnderstande his voice. For, though the Iewes heard Christs voice when he preched to them in the Hebrewe tong whiche they vnderstoode, yet if one should come vnto vs, and preach the Gospell in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewe tong, we should be neuer the better, for though wée hearde his voice, yet we shoulde not vnderstande his word, whiche is the right hearing of Christs voice.</p>

Christe saide not to his Apostles, <hi>Whatsoeuer you aske my heauenly father in my name, he wil giue it you,</hi> so that you make your prayers to him in the Latine tong which you vnderstande not Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Disciples did euer say so to any other.<note place="margin">

            <p>You muste néedes graunte this, that Christe biddeth vs aske and wée shal haue: then it is méete, if wée woulde haue, to knowe what we aske: but if wée knowe not what we saye, howe can we knowe what wée aske? and if wée knowe not what we aske, howe can we knowe what wée shall haue? then they that pray in the Latine tongue, (and knowe not what they saye) doe not knowe what they aske, and they that knowe not what they aske, they can not knowe what they shal haue, and they that know not what they shall haue, can not bée sure to haue that they lacke: And thus, you that pray in Latine after the

Popes teaching whyche you vnderstand not, are not sure to haue that you lacke: but they that praye according vnto Christes teaching in their vulgare tongue, or whiche they vnderstande (if they aske in faith) they shall be sure to haue that they lacke.</p>
            <p>But nowe, if euerye one that prayes in a knowne tong, and knowes what they aske, do not aske in faith, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obtaine not their desire, nor haue that they lacke: then all they that pray in the Latine tong, and know not what they say or aske, can not praye in faith, and therefore muste néedes goe without that they lacke. And so your prayers in the Latine tong which you vnderstand not, must néedes bée a most friuolous, and vaine prayer: whereby you bothe anger God, and deceiue your selues, therfore if you would haue God to graunt your prayer, then you muste knowe what you say to God, and wherefore you make your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>If one shoulde come to a Noble man aboute a sute, and make a babbling to him with his tong, neyther knowing himself what he saith, neither y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble man vnderstandeth what he woulde haue, do you thinke he were like to spéed of his sute at the Noble mans hands? Nay, would not the Noble man thinke he were mad, and therefore bid him go out of hys sight? yes certainely: euen so, when you come thus babbling to God, not knowing what you say or aske, do you thinke to obtaine any thing at Gods hand? No, I warrant you, but he wil be angry with you for misusing his Maiestie in such an vndecent maner, and bycause you pray not in that order to him as Christe appointed you.</p>
            <p>But haply you wil say, the comparisons are not like, for though the Noble man doth not know our mind, yet God knoweth our meaning. I know well, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God both knowes oure mindes, and our harts. But what if you know not certainely your own meanyng, would you haue God to grant your vncertaine meanyng.

            <p>Christe willed his Apostles not onely to praye in theyr own vulgar tongue, but also he taught them a prayer, and to whom they should pray.

            <p>It may be that some of you wil say that as you like not praying to Images, so you mislike not to praye vnto oure Lady or vnto Saints, that they maye praye vnto God for you, for if one would speake with a King or with a greate man, it is no harme to speake to his Chamberlaine or to one that is next vnto him, that he may shewe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of vs, which vaine reason <hi>Saint Ambrose</hi> answers very wel,<note place="margin">

            <p>Marke also what a blasphemous prayer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth teache you to pray, whereby it appeares that they that belonge to that Churche, néede not the bloud of Christ to saue them, for the bloud of <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> which was once a traitour to his King here in <hi>England,</hi> is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for they say thus in their Mattins, <hi>O Christ make vs to ascend vnto heauen whether Thomas is ascended, euen by the bloud of Thomas that he shed for thy sake.</hi> Is not this Church of <hi>Rome</hi> thinke you the true Churche of God, that blots out the blessed bloud of Christ, (without which there is no saluation:) &amp; puts in the bloud of a sinfull wretch to climbe to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by, but I thinke they mistake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:9415:88"/>
perhaps the meaning of them is thus, make vs to descende into hell whether <hi>Thomas</hi> is descended, euen by the bloud of <hi>Thomas</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he shed for the Popes sake: for surely if <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> did pray to asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by the bloud of any (but of Christ) as these of the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> doe by his, I beléeue that this your holye <hi>Saint Thomas</hi> (a Saint of the Popes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king) is rather in hell than in heauen.</p>
            <p>Can the children of God, or they that are Christians, bée content to abide in this blasphemous Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that vseth suche a kinde of praying, as desires to climbe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the bloud of a vile wretched sinner, and refuseth the bloud of that immaculate lambe Iesus Christ the sonne of God?</p>
            <p>Surely if I were as déepely drowned in that detestable Papistrie (as any of you are or euer was, hearing but halfe this that I haue written,) I should not onely with al spéede detest that abhominable Religion of the Pope, but also flie vnto Christ and take holde on his holy Gospell, as I doe not doubt but assuredly trust that many of you will.</p>
            <p>And as this Romish Church hath with hir most wicked prayer, blotted out the pure and perfecte order of praying which Christ did teache in the Scriptures, euen so, she hath with their vaine, fonde, and superstitious fastings quite ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished the true fasting required by the Gospell. For Christ in the Gospell sayth,<note place="margin">

               <hi>When ye fast, be not sad as the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are, &amp;c, but when thou fastest appeare not vnto men, to fast, but vnto thy Father which is in secret, &amp; thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</hi> Here Christ doth appoint vs, that we must not let it bée knowne when we fast: but the Popes faste is so published and the dayes so commonly and openly commaunded and appointed, that euerie one may knowe when they fast. So that Christ hath not appoynted his fasting so priuily, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of <hi>Rome</hi> proclaimes hir fastes as openly. Christ hath appointed no dayes nor times for his fasting, the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> hath appointed dayes and times for hir fasting. The meaning of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:9415:88"/>
Christs fasting is to abstaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whatsoeuer either meats or drinkes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> makes vs prone to sinne: The Popes fast is to forbeare fleshe onely, but permits men to eate all kynde of fishe thoughe it be neuer so daintie and deliciously drest, and all kinde of Iunkets and banketing dyshes, with dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate wynes, as muche as wée will cramme and poure in: Christes fast is to kéepe our bodyes lowe to be in subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the spirite: but that is not performed in the Popes fast but by their daintie dyshes and drinkes the Spirite is brought in subiection to the bodie. Christes faste is a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling &amp; an vncompelled abstinence: the Popes fast is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained abstinence, and is done of many against their wils, Christes fasting is to make vs vertuous and holy before God: the Popes fast is hypocriticall, and to make vs séeme holye before men. This is difference enough to shewe you that the Christian fasting of Christ and the common fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pope, are farre vnlike, and doe not agrée, so that the one shall haue his rewarde hereafter of God, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath his rewarde alreadie of men. Therefore beléeue not that your accustomed fast of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> came either from Christ or his Apostles, for neither Christ in his Gospell, nor the Apostles in their Epistles doe once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde it or affirme it, and therefore we can not allowe it. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> one of the excellentest Doctors, (whose iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I trust you will not refuse) writes <hi>vpon what dayes we ought not to faste,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Augu. epist.</hi> 86.</note> 
               <hi>and vppon what dayes wee ought to faste, I fynde it not appoynted or lymitted by anye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement eyther of our Lorde or of the Apostles.</hi> But what if <hi>Saint Augustine</hi> had wylled vs to faste on suche dayes as the Pope doeth appoynt, and a thousande other learned men moe, yet wée are not bounde eyther to beléeue or follow him or them, vnlesse we finde their sayings agrée with Gods word, for Gods word must leade them, but they may not leade Gods worde. Therfore bicause your Popish fast, is not commaunded nor allowed by the holye Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but cleane contrarie to the same, as before is proued,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:9415:89"/>
therefore it is superstitious, wicked, and highly displease<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>God commaundes vs to refraine swearing euerydaye, but for fasting he appointes vs no day: but the Pope com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes vs to faste certaine dayes, but byds vs not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare swearing any daye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet manye of you regarde the Popes lawe so much, and Gods commaundement so little, that you thinke it a heynous matter to breake the fasting dayes that the Pope hath commaunded: but make it no matter of conscience to sweare euery day, which God hath forbydden: therefore kéepe the fasting dayes commaunded by our Quéene for good order and pollicye, and not for the Popes pleasure, for his holinesse or hypocrisie. Thus you may sée howe farre wyde you wander, and all bicause you will not giue your selues to the hearing and reading of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Consider further of your holy Romish Religion, which attributes to oyle health of body and soule, and remission of sinnes: which no oyle (but the bloud of Christ) can doe. And therefore a most blasphemous doctrine. Thus the oyle is blest, <hi>Fiat domino hoc oleum, &amp;c. O Lorde let this oyle by thy blessing,</hi>

By this holy annoynting, thou maist haue remission of thy sinnes.</hi> Is not this a precious oyle trowe you whereby we may haue remission of our sinnes? you may sée what vertue is in the Popish Priests wordes, that can make such a precious oyle, truely if God had reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred this oyle, he might haue spared Christ his deare sonne from dying. O what a horrible and blasphemous doctrine is this that is taught by your Romish Churche, <hi>S. Thomas de Aquino</hi> which may be <hi>S. Thomas</hi> of <hi>Watring</hi> in Englishe saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iewel in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen. Apolog. pag.</hi> 190.</note> 
               <hi>Some saye, and that not without good reason that a man may obteine remission of his venial sinnes,</hi> (which are
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:9415:89"/>
not deadly sinnes) <hi>onely by entring into a Churche that is consecrate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If one had suche a Churche, it would neuer lightly be emptie, <hi>and it is purposely noted in the glose vpon the Decretalles that veniall sinnes may be remoued eyther by a Pater noster, or by holy water,</hi> that it may be so by a <hi>Pater noster,</hi> which is the Lordes prayer, (so that it be faithfully sayd), I wil not denie, but that the popish <hi>Pater noster</hi> spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Latine of them that vnderstande not what they say, or els that holy water will do it, I will in no wise graunt. Thus the church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath founde out an other manner and way of forgiuenes of sinnes then either Christ or his Apostles euer taught, what a damnable doctrine is this to teach remission of sinnes by such toyes and trifles, which can be had by no meanes but by the passion &amp; death of Christe?</p>
            <p>May not you thinke that the church of <hi>Rome</hi> is of a pure doctrine and of a perfect religion,<note place="margin">

            <p>Be indifferent Iudges your selues, was there euer such a ridiculous religion (as this your Romish religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is), that

permitte and appointe Belles to be baptised? belike their baptising makes them giue a lowde, a perfect and a true sound: if it be so, then the Bels are better baptised, than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Popes preachers &amp; Doctors be: for many of them in the pulpet giue no sounde at all, or else giue a false sounde both in their preaching and writing.</p>
            <p>Many of you mislike the putting downe of Abbayes, and wishe they were vp againe, for you thinke the Monkes &amp; Friers were the holiest men in the world, yea and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holinesse can not be well without them, &amp; that God by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was chiefly serued.

Therfore he saith they carrie their hypocrisie about to sale. S.

            </p>
            <p>This same is the Protestants Religion, to trust with <hi>S.

            <p>For marke this well, all the déedes and good workes that you can doe are but worldly workes, and if you looke to be rewarded for doing of them, yet a heauenly rewarde is to good for an earthly worke, and a heauenly wages is to much for an earthly seruice. It is inough if God gyue you a worldly rewarde for your worldly workes: Nay, is your worldly workes and seruice that you saie you doo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, worthie of the earthly giftes and rewardes that God dayly giues you? no I warrant you, if a man might aske you, that saies you may deserue Heauen by your owne merits, what seruice do you or can you do that God stands néede off? he is a heauenly King and therefore hath heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seruants, to wayte vpon him to do his will, and to serue him, who obeye him in al things &amp; offende him in nothing, but you are earthly creatures, both vnworthie &amp; vnable to
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:9415:92"/>
serue such a king, that obeyes him in nothing, and offendes him in all things. Therefore if you be his seruauntes you are but simple seruantes and serue him but slenderly, and (as Christ cals you) vnprofitable seruants. Yet for all that marke the great goodnesse of God, though we neither obey him nor are able to serue him, yet he vseth vs rather like Sonnes then seruants. Hath he not created vs to his owne likenesse, (that is our soules to the Image of God, and our bodies to the likenesse of Christ) and doth not he giue vs meate dayly to féede vs: clothes to couer vs, &amp; all things on the earth to maintaine &amp; helpe vs? now weigh with your selues what seruice doe wée to God, or are hable to do vnto him, that can deserue al these earthly benefits that he doth dayly bestowe vpon vs? No, the greatest seruice that wée can do to God, is farre vnworthie of the least benefite that God hath done to vs, therfore we can not iustly say that we serue God in any point, but rather that God doth serue our turne in euery point. For if we do him any seruice, it is only to serue our owne turne, for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we pray vnto God, (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we say we serue God), do we then serue pleasure or help him in any thing? no, it is to helpe our selues, to pleasure our selues, and to profite our selues. For by our praier to God we craue of him, those things, that we haue néede of and do not proffer him any thing that he stands in néede of. Therefore though we saie we serue God when we praie, we might more truly say that we serue our selues whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we pray. And thus wheras you claime heauen as a due reward for your seruing of God: it séemes you claime Heauen for seruing your selues, wherein I must néedes saie, that you are without all reason or honestie.</p>
            <p>For if I should come to my Prince &amp; pray hir humbly vpon my knées that she would giue me a farme to dwel in, and then she of hir goodnesse should graunt me my request: might not I be thought to be most impudent shameles and without all reason, if I should then clayme for knéeling to hir for the farme which she gaue me, the inheritance of all
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:9415:92"/>
hir kingdome? yes and well worthie, yea and therefore to be quite thrust out of hir kingdome. Euen so they that claymes the kingdome of Heauen for their praying and knéelyng to God, (for their owne profite and commoditie) are not onely most impudent shamelesse and vnreasonable, but also are well worthie to be thrust out of the kingdome of Heauen. Now if our worldly seruing of God (if we do serue him) can not deserue the worldly benefites that hée doth dayly bestowe vpon vs: then our worldly seruing of him can by no meanes deserue the kingdome of Heauen, the ioyes wherof are without comparison, and euerlasting.</p>
            <p>If a King by chaunce let his gloue fall out of a window should he that takes it vp thinke that he hath deserued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the King shoulde make him heyre of his crowne and kingdome? euery one might thinke that he were to sawsie, presumptuous, and to déere a seruant that woulde clayme such a great gift, for such a small seruice, a worse rewarde might serue well inough, many woulde bée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to do a great deale more for a great deale lesse. Nowe if this worldly rewarde is a great deale to much for suche a seruice wherof the King stoode néede, then the euerlasting kingdome of Heauen is a wonderfull deale to much for our worldly workes whereof God stands no néede, (nay which perhappes he mislikes).</p>
            <p>Therefore reuoke this Diuelish doctrine of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe Churche, whiche teacheth you that you may deserue the kingdome of Heauen by your owne workes and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, for (as it is sufficiently proued before) our owne merites deserues the kingdome of Hell, and Christes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites onely deserues for vs the kingdome of Heauen. And bragge not of your vayne and sinfull workes, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you estéeme them, the worse doth God lyke them: and do what you can for your life, yet thinke your selues vnprofitable seruauntes. For the more you thinke you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue at Gods hande: the lesse I am sure you shall haue at his hande.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:9415:93"/>The proude <hi>Pharisey</hi> and the humble and repentant <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicane</hi> may be a sufficient example to you,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke.</hi> 18.</note> for the proude presumptuous <hi>Pharisey</hi> thought he had deserued much of God for his workes: but the humble <hi>Publican</hi> thought he deserued Gods wrath for his sinnes. Now whiche of these two got more at Gods hands, and was the better estéemed of God? forsoth the <hi>Pharisey</hi> that boasted &amp; bragged of his good workes, displeased God and went away vniustified: And the humble <hi>Publicane</hi> that disabled his owne workes and trusted not to them, pleased God, and went awaie par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. So that in any wise refuse your owne merites and trust to the mercie of God and the merites of Christ: for if your workes be no better than the workes of the holy Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> before mentioned (that teaches you to haue such confidence in your workes) they are more like to bring you to Hell than to Heauen.</p>
            <p>Now marke further what a pretie toye the Pope hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised, (which is his paineful purgatorie) to pick our purses withal, marueling that you can beléeue that there is any such place. The Scriptures in diuers and sundrie places make mention both of heauen &amp; hell, but not one worde at all of Purgatorie, &amp; therefore I am out of doubte there is no such place, for if there were, eyther <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets, Christ, or his Apostles would haue spoken something of it, therefore beléeue not that the Pope and his Doctours doe saie true in this thing, that haue lied to you in so many other thinges. For it is onely inuented to feare vs withall, whereby to emptie fooles purses to fill the Popes coffers.</p>
            <p>But if there were such a place, then it shewes that the Pope is a couetous and mercilesse Tirant, that will do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for pittie but all for pence, for the rich for money shal soone be ridde out, but the poore that wante money or friends must tarrie there stil, One sayth, <hi>The Soules being in Purgatorie,</hi>

               <hi>are vnder the Popes iurisdiction, &amp; the Pope might if he would auoide all Purgatorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:9415:93"/>Truely in this it séemes that the Pope is not halfe so mercifull as Christ was, that will suffer the poore soules to lie broyling and roasting in the fire of Purgatorie, &amp; might with one worde of his mouth or a bull of leade, rydde them out of their paines and prison. But belike the Popes thinke it néedes not, bicause they knowe there is no such place: the Pope would scarce doe so much for vs if he could, as Christ did, that came out of Heauen to Earth and suffered death, to ridde vs out of hell, that will not release the soules out of Purgatorie with speaking one worde, and néedes not once go out of his chaire.</p>
            <p>Well though the Popes doe tell vs that there is such a painefull Purgatorie, yet they are not agréed among them selues of the manner of the place, nor of the paynes. For <hi>Sir Thomas Moore said that there is no water in Purgatorie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iewel in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen. Apolog. pag.</hi> 357.</note> 
               <hi>no not one drop, which he woulde proue by the wordes of the Prophet Zacharie, which are these, thou hast deliuered thy prisoners out of the dongeon wherin there is no water, but Doctor Fysher the Bishoppe of Rochester sayth there is good store of water, and that he proueth by the Prophet Dauid. We haue passed through fire and water, &amp; thou hast brought vs forth into a place of refreshing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albertus</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> say, that <hi>the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners and ministers of Purgatorie are holy Angels.</hi> But sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> saith, <hi>out of doubt they be no Angels but very Diuels.</hi> But may not one come after these two learned men, and proue that there is neither fire nor water in the Popes Purgatorie? forasmuch as the Scriptures doe not certifie vs of any such Purgatorie, therfore I am sure there is no such Purgatorie: and if there be no Purgatorie, then I am sure there is neyther fire nor water in Purgatorie: and as there is neither fire nor water there, so neither An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels nor Diuels are executioners or ministers there.</p>
            <p>It is a verie strange matter that these wise learned and graue men should be so blinde, as to apply hell from which Christ hath deliuered vs, (whereof the Prophet <hi>Zacharie</hi>

ment,) to the Popes Purgatorie, wherof neither he nor any other of the Prophets dyd euer heare. But God when and where it pleaseth him doth blinde the eyes of the mightie &amp; wise of this world, that they may not vnderstande the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and againe doth open the eyes of the simple that they may sée the truth I beséech God to open your eyes to sée the truth, whereby you may shun all falshhood and lyes.</p>
            <p>Marke further what a maruellous mischiefe the Diuell hath brought into the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling of the marriage of Priests, (although many of you thinke it is a necessarie and a godly lawe,) but howe god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so euer it is, Saint <hi>Paule</hi> calles the forbydding of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage the doctrine of Diuelles, for thus he sayeth, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite speaketh euidently,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>that in the latter tymes, some shall departe from the fayth, and shall giue heede to Spirites of errour, and diuelish doctrine of them which speake falsely through hypocrisie, and haue their consciences marked with an hotte yrone forbydding to marrie and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to absteine from meates which God hath created to be receiued with giuing thankes, of them which beleeue and knowe the trueth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth not Saint <hi>Paule</hi> poynt oute the Popes doyngs here as plainely as thoughe he had vttered him by name? for in what Religion in the worlde, but his, is marriage and eating of meates forbydden? And as this texte doeth touche the Popes wicked and superstitious fasting, which before is disproued, euen so it doth touche his forbydding of marriage, which is an abhominable and detestable doctrine as hereafter shall bée proued. For whereas the Popes lawe is that Bishoppes, and Priestes maye not marrye: Gods lawe doeth permitte and allowe them to marrye, for Saint <hi>Paule</hi> sayeth that <hi>a Bishoppe must be faultlesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>and the husbande of one wyfe, likewyse</hi> (sayeth he) <hi>muste the Deacons bee honest not double tounged, &amp;c. Euen so must their wyues be honest, not euil speakers, but sober and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all things, let the Deacons bee the husbandes of one
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:9415:94"/>
wyfe, and suche as rule their Children well, and their owne housholdes, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Saint <hi>Paule</hi> doeth allowe that the Bishops and the other Ministers of the Churche shoulde bée marryed and haue wyues: but the Popes doctrine is that neyther Bishop nor Priest (whiche are Ministers of hys Churche) shall bée marryed, and therefore the Popes doctrine here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the doctrine of the Diuels, as S. <hi>Paule</hi> termeth it.</p>
            <p>It is euident that <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Priestes of the olde lawe before Christ were marryed, then why should not our Bishoppes, Priestes, and Ministers of the newe lawe, that are after Christ bée marryed, especially not forbydden but allowed by the Scriptures?) And that you maye perceiue that Christ allowed and lyked well of the Preachers and ministers of his Churche, thoughe they were marryed, hée choosed marryed men to bée his Apostles.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Ignatius</hi> that was Scholler to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelist, sayth,<note place="margin">

               <hi>That Peter &amp; other the Apostles of Christ were marryed men.</hi> And Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> sayth, <hi>that all the Apostles had wyues onely Iohn and Paule excepted, yet Origen</hi> sayth <hi>by report of other his auncestours, that Saint Paul and his wyfe were called to the fayth both at one time, of which wyfe</hi> (as he sayeth) <hi>he writeth thus in his Epistle to the Phillipians, I beseeche thee faithfull yokefellowe, helpe these women that haue laboured with mee in the Gospell.</hi> And moreouer <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Eusebius</hi> &amp; <hi>Ignatius,</hi>

               <hi>that sawe Christ after his Resurrection, and was in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie with the Apostles say in plain words that he had a wife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps some of you wyll say, (as you haue sayd,) what though some of the Apostles were marryed, yet they vsed not the companie of their wiues after they were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but did forsake them? when you haue proued that, wée will credite you the better: but vntill then we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue you. But as it is sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly proued they were married, so can you neuer proue, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> after they were Apostles they did vtterly forsake their wiues, &amp; after neuer vsed their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:9415:95"/>You thinke belike, bicause <hi>S. Peter</hi> hath not told you that he kept his wife still and vsed hir companie: that therefore he did forsake his wife. This is no sufficient proofe, that he vsed not hir companie: for euerie one that kéepe companye with their wiues, doe not vse to tell abroade that they lye with their wiues, and so <hi>S. Peter</hi> might kéepe his wife, and vse hir company sometimes, though he neuer tolde it abrode or wrote of it in his Epistles.</p>
            <p>I thinke that <hi>Saint Peter</hi> (whom you take to bée one of Christes chiefe Apostles,) did not breake Christes his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters decrée, so soone after Christ had made him his Disciple. For Christ saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark.</hi> 10.</note> 
               <hi>For this cause shall a man leaue his father and mother and sticke to his wife, and so they are nowe not twaine but one fleshe. Therefore what God hath coupled let no man separate.</hi> And thus séeing <hi>Peter</hi> was a man, by Christes doctrine, he ought not to separate himselfe from his wife.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 5.</note>And againe Christ saith, <hi>Whosoeuer putteth away his wife, (except it be for fornication,) causeth hir to playe the harlot.</hi> So that by this it must néedes fall out, that eyther <hi>Peter</hi> did expressely against his maisters doctrine, (and so was a false seruant to Christ, in forsaking his wife,) or else his wife playde the harlot for that he put hir awaye, or else he kept his wife still and did not forsake hir. But bicause I am sure you will not say that <hi>Peter</hi> was a false seruant to his maister, in breaking of his doctrine, and for that you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not proue that she was an harlot: then it must néedes bée, that he did not forsake hir, but kept hir still as his wife, and so likewise all the rest of the Apostles that were named did not forsake their wyues: if they followed the doctrine of their maister Christ.</p>
            <p>But suppose that none of the Apostles had bene married, should that be sufficient to bind al Bishops, Ministers and Priestes from marriage? Then I may aswell say, bicause none of the Apostles were Cookes, therfore no Byshoppes, Priestes, or ministers ought to play the Cookes, or in time
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:9415:95"/>
of necessitie dresse their own dinners.</p>
            <p>Christs Apostles did not ride in their iourneis that euer I heard, (for their maister Christe did ride but once in all his life) shall the Bishops, Priests, and ministers therfore neuer ride? The Pope and his Prelates would not lyke that.</p>
            <p>Christs Apostles neuer kept any Grammer scholes, shal Priests and ministers therfore neuer teache children grammer or the latine tong? that wer not méete, Therfore Bishops Priestes and ministers are not bounde to refuse that which Christ forbad them to do. And thus though the Apostles had not bene married as the moste of them were, yet that were not a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cause to make all Bishoppes, Pristes, and Ministers liue vnmaried.</p>

And why shoulde it hinder the godly liuing of vs more than the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liuing of them.</p>
            <p>But Pope <hi>Hyldebrand</hi> whose holy and vertuous doi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs is before something set forth, did first of all establish, as is before sayd, the lawe for disanulling Priestes marryages, therby to make them his chaste Chaplaines, about fiue hundereth years ago, which the other Popes haue allowed and defended euer since, more to get monye, than to make them liue chastly, and more to séeme godly, than indede to liue vertuously, which diuelish lawe doth shewe whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple he was that deuised it, whose Children they were that procured it, whose Chaplaines they were that establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed it, and whose Prelates they were that did practise it.</p>
            <p>Therfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope by the meanes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diuel (for Pope <hi>Hyldebrand</hi> was a coniurer of Diuels that first establisht it) hath put downe the marryage of Bishops and Priests, that they may get mony to lycence them to kéepe Harlots, knowing they are not able to liue chast.</p>
            <p>Marke how God &amp; the Pope do agrée, God forbids whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom &amp; alows maryage: but the Pope forbids mariage and allows whordome, clean co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to God. God appoynteth maryage as a remedy against whordom, the Pope taketh away that remedy bicause he woulde haue whordome.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:9415:96"/>
God sayes thou shalt not steale, but he allows worke and labour. But if the Princes should make a law that none of their subiects should labour or worke: (which is the chiefe remedie against theft) as the Pope hath made a lawe that no Priests shal marry, (which is the best remedie againste whoredome) then the most of their subiects would become théeues: as the most of the Popes Priestes become whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kéepers. For put down labour &amp; set vp theft. Euen so driue away marriage and bring in whoredome.</p>
            <p>There are a great sorte in <hi>England</hi> at this present y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> liue honestly with their wiues: but if they were al vnmarryed, and might not marry, do you thinke that they al then wold liue chaste? no I warraunt you. Euen so though a greate sort of Bishops, Preachers, and ministers liue godly and honestly now hauing wiues: yet al Bishops, Preachers, &amp; ministers wold not liue godly and chastly without wiues. Nay there are some of them fornicators hauing wiues: then think you they would liue chast if they had no wiues? I thinke not. If one woman be not ynow, then no woman would be too fewe: if they can not be content with one, they would scantly bée content with none: yet you wil skantly beléeue whatsoeuer is proued or sayd.</p>
            <p>But if the Quéenes maiestie (to please you and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please God) shoulde cause all Priestes and Ministers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hir to put away their wiues, and commaunde them to liue chast, do you thinke they woulde liue chastlye? yea y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they woulde, as poore men commaunded not to laboure, would liue truely, and not steale.</p>
            <p>You maye as well learne the chastitie of vnmarried Priests, by the Popes Priests of <hi>Italie, Rome, France, Spayne,</hi> &amp; of them that were late in Qu. <hi>Maries</hi> time, which liued &amp; liue vnder their holye and chaste Popes lawes, as to haue our Bishoppes and Ministers and Preachers to putte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their wiues, for if they liue and liued chastelye wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wyues, then ours woulde liue chastly without wiues.

But for as muche as we sée and knowe that they liued and do liue most abhominably and wickedly, (counting it no sinne) and haue license of the Pope, fréely to vse the same. Therfore (as Gods word doth allow) our Bishops Priests and ministers haue their lawful wiues, to auoyde wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and whoredome.</p>
            <p>But some of you haue a déepe and greate worldly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the marriyng of our preachers and ministers will fill al the realme ful of beggers: surely if that were true, it woulde haue bene spyed once in two and twentie yeares, if you sée so muche, you sée more than manye that are as wise and as well sighted as you. I maruel why you haue not spyed as wel, that if poore labouring men, blind men, and lame men yea and beggers be marryed, that they will likewise fil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Realm with beggers? but if you allow poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to marry y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue no liuing at al, but only by threshing, hedging, ditching, and suche like, (where diuerse of them are not worth fortie shillings in all the worlde.) Yea and beggers that liues only of almes, then I thinke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéens maiestie may as wel allow, the B.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the marrying of Preachers and ministers wil fil this Realme full of beggers, is but a bare beggerlye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse.</p>
            <p>But if one shoulde aske you howe manye of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren you haue séene goe a begging, I thinke you would either holde your peace, or else say that you haue séene but a few.</p>

               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:9415:97"/>And thoughe many of the Papistical Priestes, haue bin, and are great fornicators, yet they woulde séeme to be holy husbandes (and so they had néede,) for they make vs beléeue they haue a holy wife, for they saye that oure Lady (as they call hir) is their wife.</p>
            <p>They may wel take hir for their wife, but surely she doth not take suche fornicators for hir husbands. Truly I muse that she, when she was liuing here on earth, hadde but one husband, which was both godly and chaste: and now being dead and in Heauen, to haue such a rabble of husbands that are so vitious and wicked: therefore it is not like, that she that woulde haue but one honest husbande when she was a liue, wil haue so manye naughtye husbandes when shée is dead.</p>
            <p>If the marriage of Priestes be so euill, as many of you woulde make it, then the Priests children can not be good, and so, if any Popes were Priests sonnes, then these Popes must néedes be euil.

               <hi>though one kepe hir and lye with hir before they be married.</hi> But I may answer <hi>M. Hard.</hi> thus.

               <hi>your owne Pope Gregorie himselfe will soone tell you, touching aduoutrye and other small faults:</hi> (Here the Pope makes aduoutrye but a slender or small sinne) <hi>The Bishop after penance done may dispe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with a Priest.

            <p>If they had made no falser nor worser gloses than this, their gloses then woulde haue bene more true and godlye than they are.</p>
            <p>Again in the decrées it is thus writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Whatsoeuer wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man haue such companie with Priests, let them be remoued by the Bishop and solde, and made slaues.

            <p>By this goodly glosing marriage is double fornication.

And now to beginne therein, whereas many of you are persuaded, that this youre Masse was vsed of Christe and his Apostles, and so came from them: your opinion therein is moste vntrue &amp; false, for, if Christe hadde instituted it, and the Apostles had vsed it, then assure youre selues, that Christe woulde haue made mention thereof in the Gospell, or Saint <hi>Luke</hi> would haue shewed it in the Actes of the Apostles, or the Apostles woulde haue written of it in their Epistles, or else GOD would haue reuealed it in the Reuelations, whereby Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> woulde haue vttered it in the Apocalips: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forasmuche as there is no mention at al in any of those places, eyther of the Masse, or of any part of it, as you haue it, wée muste néedes thinke, and are moste assured, that it is not to be receiued, allowed, vsed, nor estéemed, but rather to be eschewed and contemned of all true Christians, for, whatsoeuer is necessarye for vs, Christe and hys Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles haue vttered in the Newe Testament.

But it is almoste sixtéene hundred yeres since oure Communion beganne, firste instituted by Christ: and the Apostles and holy fathers vsed this our Communion, according to the Scriptures: but your Masse was patchte vppe by the Pope but of late, and vsed of his Prelates and Priests, and is not to be founde in anye parte of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and cleane contrary to the same.</p>
            <p>Therefore you may well call the Popes Masse; a newe lawe: (and not our Communion) vnlesse you call it new, bycause it agrées with the new Testament.</p>
            <p>Thus you may sée, that your Masse was patchte vppe of late, and your owne Doctors say it came not from Christ, nor his Apostles, that there are manye abuses in it, and that they know not how nor when it firste began, therfore it is méere madnes for you to estéem the Masse any longer.</p>
            <p>And thoughe this be sufficient, yet, as I haue proued the Masse ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be good, so I wil proue, that the priests be most wicked that say the Masse, (if they be wicked that are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the body &amp; bloud of Christ.<note place="margin">

Here is difference ynough betwéene Christ and the Priest. Beside all this, Christ spake in such a tong, that he &amp; the Apostles knew what was spoken: but the Priest speaketh in latine, that fewe or none vnderstande him what he sayeth: And sometimes the Priest himselfe scantly vnderstandes what he sayth. And thus bycause y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Priest receiueth it otherwise than Christ did appoint it, he taketh it vnworthyly to his condemnation.</p>
            <p>Therfore the Priests were best to leaue saying of Masse to their owne condemnation, and saye our communion to their saluation. And for al this, Maister <hi>Harding</hi> (though he knewe not by whom nor when the Masse began) yet he was not ashamed to say, <hi>That the Masse is the moste high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and moste honorable seruice that is done to God in his Churche.</hi> If it be so,<note place="margin">

For if it would deliuer vs from our sinnes, then God at this special time, wold haue heard the earnest prayer and request of Christ his deare and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sonne, and would haue kept him from that cruell death that after he suffered, and would or might haue answered his sonne thus, oh my louing sonne be merry and glad, thou shalt not dye for the sinnes of the people, for I haue deuised another easier way to saue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherby thou shalt not néede to dye, and this it is, the Pope and his Priestes shal say and celebrate the Masse, whiche is not onely the most highest and honorable seruice that can be done to me, but also it shal be a sufficient and perfit sacrifice for sinnes both of the quicke and dead, and therby they shal be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Hel, as well as though thou had dyed for them, and it shal be a ladder for them to climbe vppe to heauen. If God had said thus to his son our sauiour Christe, when he prayed so earnestlye to his Father for the sauing of hys life, I would haue liked you Masses a great deale better: but bycause Christ saide to his Father, if it be possible let this Cup of deth passe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, &amp; yet God suffred him to die for al his request, therfore it is most manifest &amp; true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is impossible for vs to be saued by any thing but only by the passion &amp; death of Christ. This is so sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t an argument to make you forsake most spéedily y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most detestable Masse, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> robs Christe of his merits, &amp; to take hold on Christ &amp; to

            <p>If it be a Sacrament as you call it, then it can not be the body of Christ: for Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> sayth, <hi>Sacramentum est visibile signum inuisibilis gratiae, A Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is a visible signe of an inuisible grace.</hi> Now if it be a signe of an inuisible grace then it is not the inuisible grace it selfe.

            <p>Further this is the true diffinition of a Sacrament, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum est signum rei sacrioris se.

                  <hi>August. in Ioan. tract.</hi> 25</note> 
               <hi>Why prepares thou thy tooth and thy belly, beleeue and thou hast eaten.</hi> Thus by <hi>S. Augustines</hi> rule, beliefe is chiefly required to the receiuing of the Sacrament, though <hi>M. Harding</hi> makes no accompt whether we beléeue or not. <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> calleth the Sacrament, <hi>Cibum mentis non ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris, the foode of the minde or Soule not of the belly. Tertullian</hi> sayth, <hi>Christe must be deuoured by hearing, chewed by vnderstanding, and disgested by fayth. Saint Augustine</hi> sayth, <hi>To beleeue in Christe, that is the eating of the bread of lyfe.</hi> And he saith also, <hi>Vnlesse yee eate the fleshe of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, yee shall haue no life in you. Christe seemeth by these wordes</hi> sayth <hi>Saint Augustine, to commaunde vs to doe an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wickednesse, for it is an horrible matter to eate mans fleshe, or to drinke mans bloud. Therefore this is a figure commaunding vs to bee partakers of Christes passion: and
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:9415:114"/>
comfortably to laie vp in our minde: that his flesh was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified and wounded for vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the eating of the Sacrament or Christes body with our mouthes (as Maister <hi>Harding</hi> doth dreame) is not to eate Christes fleshe and drinke his bloud, for this holy Sacrament of Christe supper is the foode of the soule not of the bodie, and as the bodie hath a mouth whereby it dothe féede Corporally, so hath the Soule a mouth whereby it doeth féede Spiritually, which mouth of the Soule is faith, and as our bodies are fedde and norished by eating of meate, so are our Soules fedde and nourished by beléeuing in Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>For if there be none other eating of Christes body wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we shall haue eternall life, but only by the fantasticall &amp; fleshly eating with our mouth and téeth: then how can the holy Fathers in the old time before Christe, be saued: as <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob, Moses, Dauid, Samuell,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the holy Prophetes, that neuer did eate the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with their mouthes &amp; neuer knew it? There haue bene a great sorte of godly Martirs, yong christian childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, besides the théefe that died with Christe on his right side, whome Christ promised that he should be with him in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise,<note place="margin">

But if this eating of the Sacrament with the mouth as <hi>M.

no lyfe but are vtterly damned for euer. Which no true Christian will beléeue. Therfore if you will néedes beléeue the Popes Transubstantiation, and that the Sacramentall bread is turned into the body of Christ, and that if you eate it with your mouth &amp; champe it with your téeth that then you eate the very bodie &amp; flesh of Christ: then you must also beléeue that al these holy men, martires, yong children, and the théefe that neuer did eate it with their mouthes, are da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Which Diuelish and most vntrue doctrine I hope you wil beléeue no longer, but if you do, yet we will rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue they are saued, &amp; that your Diuelish doctrine of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation is altogither false. Thus you may sée into what a great mischiefe &amp; inconuenience you are driuen by beléeuing that the Sacramentall bread is the very body of Christ. And now marke well, how you are brought into an other maruelous mischiefe and inconuenience by this your Romishe doctrine. Christ sayth, <hi>Whosoeuer eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohan.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>hath eternall life, and I will rayse him vp at the last day.</hi> Now if your eating of the Sacrament with your mouth and téeth, and your drinking of the wine, is the right eating and drinking of the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ: then <hi>Iudas</hi> is saued, for he did eate &amp; drinke it, and Iewes, Turkes and the Heathen worshippers of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols shalbe saued, if they once catch holde of your bodie of Christ and eate it, yea and the little Mouse shalbe saued if she catch it and eate it, (for I dare say for hir that she nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beléeues in Christ, nor would beléeue that it were the bodie of Christ, but a péece of bread or a cake, for if shée did thinke it were the bodie of a man shée would not come so nie it.)</p>
            <p>Thus if it be the very bodie of Christ, and be truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued whether one beléeue in Christ or not, then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Infidels, Idolaters, Tirants, and the most wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons on the earth, yea and the Mouse, the Dogge, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beast, (if they may once get this your Christes bodie into their mouthes &amp; mawes,) are sure to be saued, &amp; Christ
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:9415:115"/>
will raise them vp at the last day, for Christ saith (as it is before) <hi>whosoeuer eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud, hath eternall life, and I will raise him vp at the last day.</hi> And so by this your true &amp; reasonable doctrine, Christ will raise vp Mise and Dogges that haue and shall eate your Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at the last day, and also by this meanes the théefe is damned that Christ said should be saued, and <hi>Iudas</hi> is saued that Christ saide was damned.</p>
            <p>When you haue red this, may you not be ashamed, that euer you gaue such credite to this vile &amp; Diuelish doctrine of the Romish Church. Yes verily, if you haue any wit or reason, but especially any sparke of the grace of God.</p>
            <p>Sée hereafter I praie you, how Christes doctrine and your Romishe religion agrées in this point, forsooth euen as it doeth in all the rest. Christe sayde, <hi>I am the liuing bread that came downe from Heauen,</hi> but cleane came:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohan.</hi> 6.</note> and quite contrarie, you saie that your earthly dead bread, is Christ that went to Heauen, for I am sure, that the bread that you make your Christes bodie of, was neuer in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen), therefore your bread neuer came from heauen, and so your bread can not be the bodie of Christe), for that hée sayth, <hi>I am the liuing bread that came downe from heauen.</hi> And so your dead bread can not be the bodie of Christ. And now bycause it can not be the liuing bodie of Christe: it must néedes be a dead Substance or péece of bread. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be no longer allured by the Romishe Religion, that teacheth you thus falsely and vnreasonably, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall bread by their consecrating of it is the bodie of Christ, but beléeue as the Gospell doth tell you, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles do shewe you, as Saint <hi>Steuen</hi> doth learne you, and as your Créede doth teache you, that the bodie of Christe is now in Heauen, on the right hande of God the father, from whence hée will come to iudge the quicke and the dead.</p>
            <p>And if these be not sufficient to persuade you that he in his bodie is in Heauen and no where else, you shall heare
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:9415:116"/>
the opinions of auncient, godly and learned men, therein. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

The manhood of Christ is contained in place: the godhead of Christ is infinite and in all places. The fleshe of Christ is doubtles locall or in place: the godhead of Christ is for euer in euery place. There remained still in Christ the infinite godhead: there was receiued of him a locall manhood: how ascended he into Heauen, sauing he is very man contayned in place? how is he present with the faithful, sauing he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and true God?</hi> And last of all he saith, <hi>Vnus idemque Christus secundum humanam substantiam, &amp;c.

If <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Augustine, Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,</hi> and this <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> with many other godly fathers and learned writers haue not fabled herein: then surely the very body of Christ, that died on the Crosse, is at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent time in heauen on the right hand of God the Father, &amp; neither here on earth nor any where else, though the Pope and his Parasites tell vs that he is here.</p>

Harding</hi> commendes it not) was more like a feast than your Masse, for he did not eate his Supper by himselfe, but he bad all his Apostles to it (yea <hi>Iudas</hi> his enimie that betraide him, and all) and they did eate &amp; drinke with him, and he deuided both the breade and wyne among them: but the Priest at the Masse, though he breake the bread, yet he eates and drinkes al himselfe. Therfore if the Masse be a feast, it is not onely a churles feast, but also it is quite contrarie to Christs feast, as before is well proued. Therefore in all things the Papistical religion and doings be quite contrarie to the doings of Christ.</p>
            <p>And for that in many places before, it appeareth that your Romish religion doth ouerthrowe it selfe, euen so I will nowe by your Doctors owne doctrine, ouerthrow your

Christ of bread. It is concluded in a Booke called <hi>Antidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagma,</hi> lately set forthe by the Chapter of <hi>Colain,</hi> that the bare wordes of Christes institution without the wordes of the Canon of the Masse, are not sufficient to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration. If this bée true, then Christ dyd not consecrate the breade and wyne, bycause the Cannon of the Masse was not then, nor of a good whyle after. And you saye that before the consecration the breade is not the body of Christ, so that for want of consecration, Christ dyd not make the breade his bodye, and bycause your Priestes makyng of Christes bodye dependes wholly of Christes making the breade his bodye, for that they claime to do as he did, and by the wordes that he spake, therefore they doe not make the breade Christes bodye, bycause Christ made not the bread hys bodye: and thus by your owne doctrine, your chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the breade into the bodye of Christ, is cleane o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne, and therefore it must néedes bée breade still, and so they teache you falsely, and you beléeue falsely that the Sacrament after it is consecrate, is the body and bloud of Christ.</p>

This your Christes body is such a body by their saying, that none can sée it, féele it, heare it, nor perceiue it: and so within a whyle they will make (I hope) that not none will beléeue it, and when none beléeues it, then farewell the Masse the flowre of your follio.

            <p>A garland of Iuie before it be hanged out of a tauerne, is nothing else but a garlande of Iuie, but when it is once hanged on a pole out of the Taruerne, then it is chaunged into an other thing than it was before, for it is a signe that there is wyne to sell. Notwithstanding it is styll a garland of Iuie. But if one woulde bée so fonde as to saye, that the same garlande of Iuie that hanges out of the Tauerne, is the verye wyne it selfe that is in the Tauerne, there is none woulde beléeue hym that is wise. Euen so I muste counte you most fonde and foolishe, that take the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall breade and wyne to bée the verye bodye and bloud of Christe, which are signes and tokens of the bodye and bloud of Christ. But some of you haue sayde (so fayne you woulde haue a Christe of a Cake) what? dyd not Christ at a marryage turne and chaunge Water into Wyne, and why myghte not he then turne the Sacrament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his bodye? forsooth and well sayde, you haue broughte such an argument for the prouyng of your Christ of breade, as I wyll desire none other for the ouerthrowing of your Christ of bread. Christ you say turned Water into Wine, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Christ turned the Sacrament into his bodye. If you coulde proue the one aswell as wée can proue the other, wée shoulde agrée better herein than wée doe: but marke howe your owne weapon y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> should wound your enemie doth kill your selfe. Christ by a wondeful myracle at a marriage
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:9415:121"/>
in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galile,</hi> turned water into wine, (but the Pope and euery one of his Chapleynes tagge and ragge by your say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings doe a greater myracle than Christ did, for they turne a péece of bread into the body of Christ. Nowe you shall sée whether Christes myracle and the Popes myracle are like or not: nay in all wyse mens eyes it shall appeare that Christes turning of the water into wyne was a great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, but the Popes turning of bread into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of Christ is no myracle: for the water that Christ turned into wyne, was very pure and good wine in colour, taste, and smell, and had all the qual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ties of perfect and excellent wine: but the bread after the Priestes (as they say) haue turned it into the body of Christ, is very bread still in colour, in smell, and in taste, and is neuer a whit changed, and hath all the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of bread as it had before. So that if Christ had turned the water no better into wine than the Priestes doe turne their bread into the body of Christ, the Iewes would haue drunke none of Christes wine, they woulde haue bidde hym drinke it himselfe, and might haue sayd but for the name of wine, one were as good to drinke faire water. But if the Priestes did turne the bread into the verye body of a man, with head, face, body, armes, legges and féete (as all men haue, and that we might sée it and féele it, as the Iewes did the wine that Christ made of water, then many woulde a great deale the better beléeue them. For séeing manye doe nowe beléeue them, a great sorte moe woulde then beléeue them. Which if they shoulde doe, yet for all that no godly or wise man woulde beléeue that it were the verye bodye of Christ, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it were some other fantasticall body wrought by the power of the Diuell. For thoughe by myracle one creature may be changed into an other contrarie creature, as Christ turned water into wine (which were two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie creatures,) yet a creature by any meanes can not be turned into Christ our Creator, both God and man. But whereas Christ turned water into wine, that is one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into an other contrarie creature, the Priestes woulde
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:9415:121"/>
make vs beléeue that they turne a creature which is bread, into Christ which is no creature but God &amp; Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the sonne of God creatour &amp; maker of al things. So that Christes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be made of bread nor of any other thing, for Christ is the Sonne of God, and was not made, but was begotten by God his Father, and was conceyued by the holy Ghost, and borne on the virgin Marie. Therefore let it neyther sinke in your mindes, that a péece of bread or a cake can be turned into the bodie of Christe, nor that the bodie &amp; bloud of Christ is to be eaten and drunke with our mouthes, and so to be conueyed into our bodies, as other meates and drinkes are, but they are onely foode of the Soule, and must be eaten and drunke of the same by faith, as before is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>

Christ bad them eate it, and therfore according to Christes commaundement they eate the bodie of Christe: well the meaning of those wordes and what is the true eating of Christes bodie, is sufficiently expressed before, but to driue you cleane from this grosse and absurde errour, marke wel these reasonable argumentes following. As Christ did say this is my bodie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.</note> so he said, <hi>I am the waye, &amp;c.</hi> yet wée must not thinke therefore, that he is a very waie that leades vs from Towne to Towne: or that wée muste treade or goe vppon him when wée walke or goe to any place: as the proude Persian Prince <hi>Sopores</hi> vsed to treade on a Kings backe when hée got vp vpon his Horse.

            <p>Christe also saith, <hi>he is the light of the worlde.</hi> If wée shoulde take these wordes litterally and as they are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,<note place="margin">

But Christ doth not meane that he is the Sunne or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny suche light: But as the Sunne doth gyue vs light to direct our iourneis on the earth: so Christ being the Sunne of God, doth shyne and giueth vs our whole light in our Spirituall iourney to Heauen. And thus Christe is the light of the worlde, that in this worlde doth light vs to Heauen. Christe also sayd, <hi>I am the doore,</hi> but wée muste not thinke (though he sayde so) that he is a very doore,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10.</note> but in some respect is lyke vnto a doore, for as the righte and readie waie into a house, is to go in at the doore: so Christ is the very true doore of Heauen, by whome euery one
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:9415:122"/>
must enter that shall go into Heauen. And as Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them Théeues that enter into the house any other waie, but by the doore, euen so they are Spirituall théeues and enimies to God, that goe aboute to enter any other waie into Heauen than by Christe the true doore of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And this is the true meaning of Christe that sayd he is the doore.</p>
            <p>Christ also sayd, <hi>haue I not chosen twelue of you, and one of you is a Diuell?</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.</note> (meaning <hi>Iudas</hi> that after betrayed him) &amp; if we may credite old wiues fables, the Diuell hath hornes and clouen féete, yet we must not thinke, (though Christ called him so) that <hi>Iudas</hi> was turned or Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiated into a Diuell, and had hornes and clouen féete: But as the Diuell is a murtherer and a betrayer of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud, so <hi>Iudas</hi> did resemble the Diuell in betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his innocent maister Christe: and in procuring his death.</p>
            <p>Thus you may sée that the wordes of Christ are not alwayes to be vnderstanded litterally as Christe spake them, no more ought those wordes spoken by hym of the Sacrament. But if all this that is sayde herein, will neyther satisfie nor persuade you, I woulde fayne knowe of you, whether the bread is turned into Christes bodie, that was vncrucified or that was crucified, if you saye it was his bodie that sate among his Disciples at his last Supper before hée was crucified, then how coulde he die on the crosse after, séeing his Apostles had eaten his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die before? If you saie, it was his bodie after it was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, that coulde not be, for when he brake the bread to his Disciples, he was not then crucified, therefore he could not gyue them his crucified bodie to eate, for then it was not crucified, for as one can not gyue to any baked bread before it bée baked, so Christe coulde not gyue hys cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified bodie to his Disciples before it was crucified. And thus euery way you are dryuen to a mischiefe.</p>

               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:9415:123"/>There was a learned man (he was a maister of Arte at the least) chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to be at supper where I was with diuers other, who said then that he would proue by Scriptures &amp; by learning, that the bread after it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>secrated by a priest, is the very bodie of Christ, the same that was borne on the virgin Marie: whome then I asked if he would stand to his worde, and he said he would: then I said to him againe, that I would eyther make him denie his worde, yéeld vnto me, or else hold his peace, for want of answere: who answered me againe (as it séemed) both proudely and disdainfully, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I was to yong a Scholler to do that. Then I sayd againe, if I do it not, then let all them at this table beare witnesse of it. And thus I began with him. I pray you sir how long is it since Christ was borne on the virgin Marie, and began in his humanitie? forsooth sayd he aboue fiftéene hundreth yéere since: you will denie this saide I, no that I will not saide he, for I can not if I would: then I answered him again, I feare either you wil denie it, or else hold your peace, which is as good as a grant, for <hi>qui tacet consentire vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur,</hi> you are not ignorant I am sure sayd I, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to morrow there wilbe many Masses sayd &amp; song (though not in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,) yet in <hi>Rome, Italie, Spaine, France</hi> and other places: that is surely so, said he: at the same Masses to morowe, said I againe, you are sure that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Priests will haue litle cakes, &amp; vntill the Priests haue consecrated them they are bread, yea said he that is very true, but assoone as he hath conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated them (said I) then it is the very body of Christ, that I must néedes graunt sayd he: then said I to all them that did sit at the table, maisters I pray you beare recorde, this Gentleman said in the hearing of you all, that to morrowe the litle cakes before the priests consecrate them, be bread, and immediatly after they haue consecrated the same, they are then the very bodie of Christ. So that hereby he plainly affirmes, that to morow the bodie of Christ wilbe made of a péece of bread, or that a litle cake will become the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ, whereby the bodie or humanitie of Christe
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:9415:123"/>
will begin to morrowe: notwithstanding he sayd as you did heare but euen now, that it is aboue fiftéene hundreth yéeres since the humanitie or the body of Christe first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. Which when I had spoken, all they at the table did not only hold their peace, but also the sayd learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had neuer a worde to say. Wherein he did wisely, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to say nothing, than nothing to the purpose. And thus by this true argument he was confuted, that by false ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentes thought to confute the trueth.</p>
            <p>And if this argument will not suffice you with diuers before that are infallible, but that you wil néedes persist in your most grosse opinion, &amp; beléeue that the Sacramentall bread is chaunged into the verie bodie of Christe, then I would faine know why the Priestes are allowed and doe vse to burne their bodie of Christ, when it doth putrifie, is mustie or waxe mowlie?<note place="margin">

            <p>But I will go further with you, what is that is burned or that was burned when Pope <hi>Hildebrand</hi> did cast the bread his bodie of Christ into the fire, or whereof are the ashes that commes of that you burne, or that Pope <hi>Hilde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand</hi> burned, eyther they must be the ashes of the body of Christ, or the ashes of bread. If they be ashes of the bodie of Christ, then why do they burne the bodie of Christe? and what wicked wretches are they that burne the bodie of Christ? no maruell though they burne the poore seruaunts of Christ, when they sticke not to burne the bodie of Christ himselfe. But if it be lawfull for them now in this world to burne Christes bodie whiche they make themselues: then it is as lawfull for God hereafter in the worlde to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:9415:124"/>
come to burne their bodies and Soules that hée made himselfe (farre inferiour to Christes bodie,) which I feare hée will, vnlesse they repent betymes this their maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous abusing of the woorthy Sacrament (whiche Christe lefte vs for a memorie of hys death and Passion,) and for thus deludyng the people of God. And if they are the ashes of bread that is burned, then why doo they make vs beléeue that it is the bodie of Christe? but there are some of you so vnshamefast, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to maintayne your errours, haue sayd that neyther the bodie of Christe nor the bread is bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the Accidentes, that is the whitenesse or colour, the roundnesse, the breadth, the thicknesse, the taste and the smell is burned, and thereof the sayde ashes came: that is very strange that a matter or Substance, (which is the ashes) should come of Accidentes. This is more than euer I knew, I haue heard that Accidents come of a matter or Substance, but not Substance to come of Accidents. If the Accidents were burned as some of you saye, then I would know whether the Accidents of Christes bodie or of bread was burned. If you saie they were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Accidents of Christes bodie that was burned, and his bodie is whole and sound and vnburned, then you haue drest Christe well in déede, you haue made Christe to haue a proper bodie, yea such a bodie as fewe haue heard of, for then the bodie of Christ is neyther shorte, long, thicke nor thinne, grosse nor leane, round nor square: and you haue made him also without weight, colour, taste, and smell, what a kinde of bodie haue you made Christ to haue, for want of his Accidents which are burned? there is not such a bodie to be found in all the whole worlde, as you haue made Christe, if you haue bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned al these his Accidents from him. If you say you burned the Accidents of bread, as the roundnesse, thicknesse, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, weight, taste, smell and colour, and left the bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining vnburned, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you burned no part of the bodie of Christe, &amp; so your Sacrament was not the bodie of Christ. But I would very fayne sée that bread that you drest in
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:9415:124"/>
that order: it woulde be a strange cake if one might sée it, that hath neither colour, taste, smell, thicknesse, length, breadth, nor weight, such a péece of bread or cake was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet séene nor neuer will be. You may sée what mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieues, inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniences, and impossibilities you bring your selues into, with maintaining your most false and grosse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of Transubstantiation. So that whether you burne the bodie of Christ or the bread, or those Accidents either of the bodie of Christe or of bread, you are confounded, &amp; your Christ of bread cleane lost and vanished, and your Christ of bread proued nothing but bread, &amp; so you do honor, worship, knock and knéele to a cake or péece of bread, whiche must néedes be most wicked and detestable idolatrie.</p>
            <p>And further, if you saie you burne but the Accidentes, so mighte <hi>Iosias</hi> also saie, when he burned the Priestes of <hi>Baal</hi> on the Altars whereon they committed Idolatrie, that he did not burne the Priestes nor hurte their bodies,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Kings.</hi> 23.</note> for he burned but their Accidents, as their colour, their length, breadth, weight, thicknesse, thinnesse, sauour and suche lyke. So if the Quéenes Maiestie should burne these Missall Priestes, that make Christe and eate Christe, and if he once be past mans meate, burne Christe, (who hath as great authoritie so to do as <hi>Iosias</hi> had) shée might likewise saye their fleshe nor bodies were not burned nor hurte, but their Accidentes, as their length, breadth, thicknesse, thinnesse, weight, and colour, and such like: but if they were thus handled (though they woulde make vs beléeue that nothyng of the Sacrament is burned but the Accidentes,) they woulde then both beléeue and féele, that their bones, fleshe, skinne, sinewes, and all their whole bodies were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded aswell as their Accidents.</p>
            <p>Marke this also, if the bread bée chaunged into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christe by the Priestes consecrating it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Carion. Martinus Polonus.</hi>
               </note> then why was the Emperoure <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixth, poysoned by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the bodie of Christ? and why was Pope <hi>Victor</hi> poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his Chalice by drynkyng the bloude of Christe?
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:9415:125"/>
is the bodie of Christe nowe so farre contrarie to it selfe to that it was before, and is nowe become a destroyer and killer of menne, whiche before was a helper and healer of men? a meruailous matter, when Christ was here on earth and his bodie not glorified,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 11.</note> he raysed <hi>Lazarus</hi> from death to lyfe that had bene foure dayes dead: and now that he is in Heauen and glorified, his bodie hath poysoned and killed men that had lyued aboue thirtie yéeres, and so brought them from lyfe to death. Therefore how soeuer you haue vsed Christ amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g you, he is wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfully changed. A man would thinke it had bene more likely, that Christes bodie (being so full of vertue and power as it is) that it should haue turned the poyson mixt with it, to the good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and vertue of it selfe, and to haue preserued mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: and not the poyson to turne Christes bodie into poyson and so to poyson or kill men.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will saie, that it was not Christes bodie that the poison was mixt withall, truely if you say so I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue you, I allow his wit the better that he tarried not: it was time for him to be gone, for if he had tarried he had bin poisoned. But I pray you what was it then that the poison was mixt withall? you will not now for shame say that it was the accidents of Christes bodie, least you make Christ to haue such a strange bodie, or rather no bodie at all, as is before mentioned. Belike then it was the bread that was there before, for the one it must néedes be, for (what soeuer the Popes Doctors saie,) al learned and wise men affirme, that there can be no Accidentes without a Substance, and yong children that are but in the beginning of their Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer can tell you, that an Adiectiue must néeds haue a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiue: truly if the bread being the bodie of Christ and exalted to so high a degrée, did vnchriste himself, &amp; was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to become bread again, &amp; to be poisoned to saue the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Christ fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poisoning: then it was the louingst bread, the friendliest bread, &amp; a bread of the greatest consideration that I euer heard of: well in so doing I muste néedes saie,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:9415:125"/>
that the bread shewed Christ a verye friendly part: for if the bread had not come againe, then Christ himself had bin poysoned, and then he had dyed twice, &amp; then the professors of the Gospell had bin vtterly vndone, for the Pope beyng <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>opercioner with Christ (hauing both one consistorie or seate of Iudgement) would haue claimed all by suruiuor, and so he woulde haue sit alone, and thereby he might haue sent the Diuels and the wicked to heauen, and the Angels and the godly to hell.</p>
            <p>But if one shoulde aske you howe many bodyes Christ had, I am sure you will say he had but one, if you say true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: then if the bread were changed as you say, yet coulde it be but a péece of the body of Christ, or else Christ hath had at one time twentie thousand bodyes at the least, for I am sure there haue bin so many Masses at the least saide in one day.</p>
            <p>Though this be sufficient that I haue alreadie spoken to any Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, godly, wise or reasonable man, that the bread is not, neither by any meanes can be changed into the body of Christ, yet I will go further with you: Suppose y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ at his last Supper by these wordes <hi>(this is my bodye)</hi> dyd turne the bread into his very body, (which before is proued he did not, both by the scriptures, auncient Doctors and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reason) yet therefore the Priestes are neuer a whyt the neare for the turning or changing of the breade into the body of Christ. For if he had done it, yet he gaue them no warrant nor commission to doe it. For where can you finde that Christ said, as often as any Priest shal pronounce and say these wordes ouer a white little cake, (this is my body) and shall blesse and consecrate it, that straight way the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cake shall be turned and transubstantiated into my very body, and the substance of the bread from thence forth shall be cleane gone, and my very bodye, fleshe, bloud and bone, that was borne on the virgin Marie my mother, shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine there in the steade of bread. If you coulde shewe vs these wordes or such like spoken by Christ, then it woulde
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:9415:126"/>
séeme that they had Christes commission so to doe, but they haue from Christ no such commission or warrant so to doe, (if Christ had done it as he did it not.) Therefore all the racking, glosing, and expoundyng of the some wordes of Christ, serue your turne neuer a whyt: all that Christ said therein to his Apostles was, doe this in my remembrance. So that neyther Pope nor Priest can haue anye more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie therein than the Apostles had themselues. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Priestes doe not onely most wickedly to make you beléeue that the Sacramentall breade is the body of Christ, which is but a signe or remembraunce of Christ and his death, but also both they and you committe moste horrible and abhominable Idolatrie, in knéeling to it and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of it.</p>
            <p>If a great Lorde that loues me wel, being my maister, should deliuer me his painted picture (which were somthing more like him than a cake is like Christ) &amp; say to me, when you looke on this my picture, in my absence, remember me: and then if I should when he were gone, shew the same pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abroade, &amp; say to euerye one that sées it, that the same picture is my Lord &amp; maister himselfe that left it with me, and so make curtesie to it, and reuerence &amp; honor it for the said Lorde, all that should sée me doe so, woulde not onely thinke I were starke mad, but also my said Lord &amp; maister that loued me so much, would not be very wel content with me for taking and honoring that dumbe, dead, and sencelesse picture for himselfe, that he did leaue with me for a signe to remember him withal in his absence: besides that, I thinke he would dismisse me (as I were wel worthy) out of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. Euen so all wise men may thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you are more than mad, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> take a péece of breade for the body of your deare and louing maister and Sauiour Christ, and knéele to it and honor it for Christ: which he hath lefte you for a signe to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber him withal in his abse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; a pledge of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming againe. And doubtlesse he wil be very angry with you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> so doe, &amp; thrust you out of his seruice, that giue that honor to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:9415:126"/>
a péece of breade, that is due vnto himselfe, (vnlesse you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and take it for a remembrance of him as he did leaue it for you.) Thus you may plainly sée that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ spake <hi>(this is my body)</hi> will not serue their turne any way to make the sacramentall bread the body of Christ: nay the Popes Doctors by tossing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same euery way for their tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, haue brought themselues into such a maze or labyrinth, that they can not tell how to get themselues out.</p>
            <p>I could haue helped the Pope to a better place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than this for the making of Christes bodye: whereby Christ should not onely by expresse wordes haue allowed it for his bodye at all times, but it shoulde haue bene like the body of Christ, in substance, qualitie, &amp; all other accidents. And that is this: <hi>Christ tooke a child and sayd,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 18.</note> 
               <hi>who so shal receiue such a little child in my name receiueth me.</hi> These are Christs very words, and woulde haue serued the Popes turne a thousand times better than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ spake of the sacrament at his last supper. But perhaps it may be thought, that by this word, <hi>whosoeuer,</hi> euerye one may doe it aswel as the Pope &amp; his Priests, therfore it is not for his purpose. Yea but I could helpe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> matter wel enough, for as much as the Pope hath power to expound the scriptures as he list, and that they shall haue none other sense than he will allow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope might haue said, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whereas Christ said, whosoeuer receiueth such a child in my name receiueth me, that is to say, whosoeuer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes, or of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Abbots, or priests, receiueth such a child in my name, receiueth me. And thus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pope &amp; his Priestes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so euer they would haue made the body of Christ might haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a childe and said: In the name of Christ, I receiue thée, and then straight way, by Christes owne wordes, the same childe had bene Christ: And so they might haue allured &amp; taught the people to haue knéeled to the same chyld, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped it, and so to haue taken it for Christe (althoughe it were not.) And thus doyng they shoulde not onelye haue had a good commission fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ by special words so to do,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:9415:127"/>
but also the childe whom they made the people beléeue was Christ, should haue had the proportion, shape, forme, body, bones, fleshe, skinne, head, armes, legges, &amp; all other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as Christ had. And therefore the Pope &amp; his Priestes bée very farre ouerséene, that without any authoritie make the body of Christ of a deade péece of breade so farre vnlike vnto Christ, and might haue made it with Christes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and warrant, of a liuing childe, that in all pointes (to the eye) is like vnto Christ. This had bin a finer, likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more credible way, to haue made Christ of a lyuing body, than of dead breade. For if the people are so fonde to beléeue that a cake of bread is the very body of Christ, then they would (I thinke) quickely beléeue, that a quicke boy or childe, were euen Christ himselfe.</p>
            <p>But though the Priest might make many beléeue that that same childe were Christ, yet perhaps the father of that childe would not beléeue it, but would say vnto the Priest, sir you make the people beléeue a false lye, for this childe is not Christ, he is my sonne, I begot him, and I am his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Euen so might the Wafer maker say to the Priest, sir you are much deceiued, and deceiue the people also, this is not the body of Christ, it is a cake, and thereof I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sure, for I my selfe made it. And though this had bene a more fitter text for the Pope to haue chosen, for the making of Christes bodye: yet if they had sayde the same wordes a thousand times ouer a boye, yet for all that he shoulde haue bene a boye still as he was before, (so the cake of breade is a cake of breade still, thoughe the Priest prattle neuer so much ouer it.) For as I sayd before, Christs words ought not alwayes to be taken litterally, but sometimes spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: and so these wordes of Christ ought also to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed spirituallye, and not as Christ spake them. For though Christ sayde,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 18.</note> 
               <hi>Whosoeuer shall receiue such a little childe in my name receiueth mee,</hi> he ment thereby, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer receiueth such a one in his name, and doth any thing for him for Christes sake, he shall haue as great a rewarde
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:9415:127"/>
therfore as though he had receiued Christ, or done y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same to Christ himselfe. And he that receiueth the spiritual me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christe, he muste néedes receiue and entertayne the spiritual heade of that member which is Christ: but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Christ his owne person or verye body, none can doe, neyther can we haue the body of Christ prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes before the last day, though you most fondly and falsely beléeue, that his body is presente here, and that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental bread is turned into his body, which is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye proued before to be a moste absurde, grosse, and wicked errour.</p>
            <p>Therefore whosoeuer sayth there is no bread in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but that it is the bodye of Christ, beléeue him not,<note place="margin">

If any of you haue done so, as I thynke some of you haue done so, yet you ought rather consider the thing wherefore you sweare or make your vowe, than the partie to whom you sweare or make your vowe, and the trueth and goodnesse of the matter, not the affection you beare to the person. Bycause your father, mother, or some other of your dearest friends, beléeued all their liues, and their Fathers before them, that the breade after the consecration is the verye bodye of Christe, yet that makes not that therefore it is the bodye of Christe, the heathen, and their Fathers, grandfathers and greate greate grandfathers before them doe, and haue moste wicked worshipped Idolles, yea and perhappes some of them at their deathes haue made their children or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whome they loued, to vowe or sweare vnto them, that they shoulde neuer forsake or refuse to worship theyr Gods or Idols, and that they shoulde by no meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Christians: yet this is not a sufficient argumente, to proue that therefore their Idols were Gods and oughte to be worshipped? or saye that therefore they shoulde kéepe their othe or vowe, to take their Idols for Gods and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them, and not to become Christians.</p>

for feare of loosing his fathers blessing? that were not méet: no more ought you to beléeue that a Cake of breade is the verie bodie of Christ, and to knéele to it and worship it for Christ, thoughe youre Father or mother beléeued so, and worshipped it, and though they at their death charged you of their blessing, so to doe: it is better for you to lose youre Father and mothers blessings, to haue the blessings of God, than to loose the blessings of God to haue the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of your Father and mother: neuer feare to breake your vowe or promise made to your earthly Father, if the kéeping of them will displease your heauenly Father: regarde not mans doctrine vnlesse it agrée wyth Gods do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: care not for mans commaundemente vnlesse it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée with Gods commaundement: and wey not what man doeth charge you, as long as GOD doeth not charge you.</p>

And further I thinke you wold not be content with them, that shoulde say you like wel of their worshipping of that golden calfe: And as you thinke not wel of their doings therein: So we can not like well of your doings herein, for as those wicked and rebellious Iewes moste falselye and abhominably did attribute the wonderfull deliueraunce out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to a molten image of mettal, and did worshippe the same which had neither life nor soule: So you most wickedly and Idolatrouslye do worship and honor a péece of breade that hath neither life nor soule, and do say, this is the verye body of Christe, the sonne of God, that was borne on the Uirgine <hi>Marie,</hi> which hath brought vs out of the spirituall bondage vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>Pharao</hi> the Diuel, and that hath saued vs by his death from endlesse damnation.</p>
            <p>Doe not you here make a cake or a péece of breade that hath neither life nor soule, to be Christ the sonne of God? y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath deliuered you out of Hel, as these fond foolish Iews did make a dumbe and dead golden Calfe to be the liuing God, that brought them out of the land of <hi>Egipt?</hi> Yes veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and thereby you make that the cake hath done more for you, than the golden calfe did for them, for their bodies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye were deliuered out of a shorte thraldome in <hi>Egipt:</hi> but bothe youre bodyes and soules are deliuered oute of the

endlesse tormentes in Hell. So that hereby you approue, that the Cake (whiche you say is the very body of Christ, and Christ is our onely redéemer out of hel) hath done more for you than the Iewes coulde attribute that the golden Calfe hadde done for them. And as they honored the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Calfe for their God, so you honor the cake of bread for your Christe.</p>
            <p>O howe witlesse and senselesse are you? can any of vs that are liuing soules, and made to the Image of God, bée equall wyth Chryste the sonne of God? no truly: and then can a péece of breade be Christ, that is a dead and senselesse creature, and that God hath made for vs to eate? no it is impossible.</p>
            <p>Therfore, as the Iewes were worthily plagued for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the word of the Lorde, in committing suche wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Idolatrie to a golden Calfe: euen so assure your selues, for your contemning and refusing the Gospell, and for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this moste detestable Idolatrie to a Cake of bread (making it your Christe) that you shal receiue the gréeuous plagues before rehearsed (or greater) in this world, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your deaths, euerlasting torments in hel fire: suche, as no tong can expresse, or hart can thinke, vnlesse you repent vnfainedly, flye from your Romish doctrine moste spéedily, and embrace Christes Gospel right thankfully, (whiche is the pure doctrine of Christ and law of God, thoughe many of you moste blasphemously call it Heresie.) Therefore right earnestly I desire you, and most humbly beséeche you to cease from worshipping a Cake on earth, and fall to the honoring of Christ in heauen.</p>
            <p>Thus you maye sée, if you wil sée, that youre Popishe Masse, and your Transubstantiation or turning or chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the bread into the body of Christe, by Gods worde is confounded, by the Doctors confuted, and by naturall reason cleane ouerwhelmed (which you counted y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and holyest parte of the Romish religion) besides that it is a most diuelish, detestable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and damnable doctrine, which
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:9415:130"/>
robbes God of his glorie, Christe of his merites, and you of youre saluation.</p>
            <p>Hitherto you may perceiue that the Popes and their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doe not muche differ, for, as the Popes were moste wicked and diuelish, so their religion is most erronious and pernitious: So that howe can you thinke well of your selues, and how can you take your selues to be méete mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Englande</hi>; that for to haue this abhominable, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous and monstrous Masse againe planted here, you seeke or wish the supplanting of our prince, the ouerthrow of our Nobilitie, the sorrowe of our Communaltie, the confusion of our Country, and the ruine of the whole realme of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> wherefore with all spéede, of English enimies becom English friends, to be defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by the power of <hi>England,</hi> and to be nourished in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And séeing that I haue proued vnto you, that your Masse is a gugaw, not a Iewell, a poyson, not a preseruatiue, a confusion, not a consolation, and a guyder to Hel, not a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Heauen. Nowe you shall heare what proper things the Popes pardons are to please you withall, as your yong children are pleased with Babies, but I would to God his pardons did hurte you no more, than the Babies doe the children: for the Babies doe stil them when they crye, and make them mery &amp; hurte them not, but the Popes pardons please you here for a while, to displease you euer after. I may compare the Popes pardons to a counterfaite Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as if a false suttle fellowe (to get mony withal) should write a large Priuiledge from the Prince, counterfayting the Kings seale, wherein he sheweth, that the King hath giuen hym licence (and whome hée shall allowe) to steale without daunger of any lawe, and to haue no harme there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoughe they be taken with the manner: where vppon many giue him money to be priuiledged thereby to steale, and think it to be no counterfaite, but a true priuilege from the Kyng, whereby they steale boldelye, but are hanged therefore sodainely: and though they alleage for themselues
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:9415:130"/>
at the gallowes, and shewe their aucthoritie to steale from hym that had the counterfaite Priuiledge, and say, that hée had money of them for it: yet al that wil not serue, but they are hanged for their stealing: Euen so the Pope maketh you beléeue, that he, by his power and auctoritie from God, may pardon whom he list, for whatsoeuer offence they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, but whatsoeuer he say, he hath no such Priuilege from God, therfore his is but a counterfaite Commission, which he like a false harlot hathe inuented, onelye to get money, whose wordes you so credite, that you beléeue, that God himselfe solde his Commission: wherevppon you thinke, that Commission from God is so cocke sure, that you gyue hym mony for his pardons, whereby you thinke you are not onely pardoned of all your sinnes, and as cleane as when you were newe borne: but also, that you maye fréely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit what sins you wil, assuring your selues, for money ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at anye time to be pardoned at the Popes handes, (yet we must not say, but that your religion doth restraine men from sin, and our religion of the Gospell doeth giue libertie to sin, but how true it is, herein you may sée, (if you be not blinde:) but when you are deade, (if before you haue not a better pardon of God without money, than you haue of the Pope for money) you are like to be hanged in hell, with the Popes pardons about your necke. And then the Pope brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth you into a worse case, than they that were hanged for stealing by a counterfaite Priuiledge.</p>
            <p>But marke the mischieuous crafte of the Pope, all the wares that he selleth you, as his Masse, Trentalles, Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and pardons and al other his trumperie, are such, that by iust tryall in this life, you cannot comptroll them, or say they haue not pleasured you, excepte you looke in Gods worde, whyche hée kéepeth safe ynoughe from you: for the tryall of hys wares, whether they do you good or not, is after your death: whereby he is sure you can not come backe agayne, to chyde or checke him for selling to you such deceitfull wares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:9415:131"/>He promiseth and selleth you great and wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull things that are to be tryed after your death, but he doeth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and sell you things of smaller force and waight, that maye be tryed duryng youre life.</p>
            <p>I warrant you he wil not sell you any Pardons or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges, that steale as ofte as you wil, you shall neuer bée hanged or putte to death therefore: that eate as muche as you will, you shall neuer surffet or be sicke of it: drinke as much as you wil, you shal neuer be drunk: and spend what you list, you shal haue neuer the lesse mony in your pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e: and yet these are easier things for him to promise and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, than to giue vs the kingdom of heauen y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deserue the kingdom of hel, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to saue vs from our spirituall hanging in Hel, though we neuer so much robbe God of his glorie: and though we offend neuer so much, yet still to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and cleane clensed from sinne. Wherfore, you may wel suspecte, nay firmely beléeue, that his pardons and other wares that he so boldly sels you, are naught, bycause they are such as you can not reproue before you be dead: and for that he neuer offers to sel you any thing that you may trie whiles you are aliue. For he knowes full well, that if hée should sell you a priuiledge, that though you eate neuer so much, or what meate soeuer you eate, you shoulde neyther be sicke or surfet thereby: yet when you were sicke or did surfet, by eating of it, (wherof you should be sure) then you would say that his priuiledges were naught, not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning and despising them: but also all other that knewe it, would neuer after buy any of those his priuiledges. And also the Pope is right certaine, if he should sell one a plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, that whatsoeuer he did steale, he should neuer be hurt, hanged, nor put to death for the same: yet when he should be troubled, hanged, or executed for stealing, (which he should be sure of at one time or other) then the same théefe would not only crie out of the Pope for deceyuing of him, and for selling to him suche a false plackard, and perhaps would saie that he had neuer played the théefe but for the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:9415:131"/>
Popes warrant to saue him harmelesse, as manye I feare would not sin so muche but for the Popes pardons: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so euery one that shoulde heare howe the Pope hadde ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hym, woulde despise the Pope, and buy no more of his plackardes. But as these that shoulde buy suche Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges of the Pope to robbe and steale at their pleasure, without anye feare of punishement, were worthye to bée compted for théeues, so you that buy the Popes pardons, to release you of your sinnes, whereby you may be bolde to offende God at youre pleasure, can not be compted verye true to God.</p>
            <p>But nowe, for that perhaps you wil giue but small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to my reasons, arguments, or persuasions, for the reprouing of the Popes pardons (though some of you may happly yéelde as bad reasons, arguments, or persuasions for the proouing of the Popes pardons) I will first shewe you by Christes owne wordes (who is worthy to be belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) that we ought to craue pardon for oure sinnes onelye of God: For in our prayer (whiche Christe taught vs) wée do say: <hi>Our father which art in heauen, &amp;c. Forgiue vs our trespasses, &amp;c.</hi> Here you maye sée,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> that wée are taughte by Christe to aske pardon for oure sinnes of God, and not of the Pope. And forasmuch as we committe our sins againste God, and not againste the Pope: therefore wée ought to craue Gods pardon, and not the Popes pardon: if we offende the Pope, the Popes pardons maye doe vs pleasure, but if we sinne against God, the Popes pardons can doe vs no good (though they may doe vs muche harme, by trusting to them that can do vs no good.)</p>
            <p>Al the holy Patriarkes, Prophets, holy and vertuous kings, that God both loued and blessed, Christs Apostles, &amp; al holy Martirs &amp; other godly men did neuer aske pardon for their sins and offences but onely of God. And shal wée think, that bycause they had not the Popes pardon, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they wer not pardned? or shal we beléeue that you are better pardned of the Pope than they were of God? think
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:9415:132"/>
you what you wil, for I can neuer thinke it, neither wil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue it.</p>
            <p>If you can shewe me but one of the holy Patriarks, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or the Apostles, or godly martyres, or other aunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and holy fathers, that either bought any of these Popes pardons, or desired anye of the Popes pardons, as wée can shewe you, that euery one of them didde onely require and craue Gods pardon: I will yéelde vnto you, and graunte, that the Popes pardons are good, necessarie, and requisite: But bycause I am sure you cannot, therefore to allowe the Popes pardons we oughte not. And bycause none of all these holy menne of God (whome God dearely loued) nor yet Christe the sonne of God: whome God aboue all other estéemed, did neuer teach, write, nor once make mention of the Popes pardons, therefore I am sure, that they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good nor necessarie: For, if the Popes pardons hadde béene so full of vertue (as some of you fondely beléeue) wée should haue hearde something of them in one place or other of the Scriptures. Nowe, for that they are not warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Gods word, nor to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in any part of the Bible, therefore if you are true Christians, if you loue Christe, if you woulde haue Christ to take you to be of his shéepe and flocke, then beléeue not the Popes pardons, trust not to the Popes pardons, neither allow the Popes pardons, bycause they are not allowed nor expressed in the Gospel and lawe of Christe: For, if an Aungell shoulde come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, or if one should come vnto vs in the likenes of Christ, teaching any other doctrine than Christe hathe alreadye taught vs: we ought not to beléeue them. Then wée may wel ynough discredite the Pope, that is a wicked earthlye man cleane contrary to God, and also contemne and refuse his paltrie pardons, that are contrary to Gods worde.</p>
            <p>And though some of you through ignorance, and Papisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call persuasions thinke that the Scriptures doe allowe the Popes pardons, you shall here what <hi>Siluester Prierias,</hi> (that was Maister of the Popes Pallace) writeth therein,

               <hi>but by the aucthoritie of the Church of Rome and of the Pope, whiche is greater than the aucthori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Scriptures:</hi> Here you sée, that the Popes owne seruant confesses, that pardons are not aucthorized or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Gods worde, but they are aucthorized by the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> and by the Pope, whose aucthoritie hée saith is greater than the word of God. Marke this wel, to proue the Popes abhominable pardons, the vile wretch and the Diuels Doctor doth not sticke to committe moste horrible blasphemie, making the Pope aboue God, and the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> aboue the lawe of God.

I hope that you that are the déepest drowned in Papistrie, wyll detest and abhorre the Popes pardons, that muste bée allowed or aucthorized by one that is greater than God and his word.

I think if one had got a child on Christs mother, if he were here on earth or aliue, I thinke the Pope (though hée were a bastard) would make him Legitimate, and I think they would make him more than the brother of Christ, for I beléeue he would say it were Christ himselfe: for he that makes a Cake to be Christ, woulde surely make our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies second sonne to be Christ.</p>
            <p>What folly and fondnesse is this your Romish religion, to pardon such vndecent and impossible things, but as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the things are ridiculous, foolish, &amp; vnméete to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that the Pope promiseth to pardon: So all his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons that should pardon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are vayne toyes and bables to please fooles withal, and of Christians are to be derided, reiected and to be abhorred.</p>

vttering of his wares of all that euer I knew or hard: for though his pardons are starke staring noughte and doe muche harme, yet manye are so witlesse and foolishe and so farre in loue with the Pope and his pardons, that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they shoulde not haue them, they would goe to <hi>Rome</hi> with great paine, trauell, and cost, and pay dearelye for them when they come there (thoughe they hang them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, drowne themselues, breake their neckes and dye sodainely when they come hom.

            <p>If Christ had vsed the Iewes in this sorte, as the Pope doth vse you, that is, to promise much &amp; performe nothing, so manye woulde not haue followed him as did, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Pope he promised little &amp; performed much.

I neuer heard or red that he eyther hanged himself, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himself, or brake his necke, died sodainly or desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as many of them haue done that haue had the Popes pardon. Christ layde his hands vppon yong children and blessed them (which was as good and a litle better than the Popes or Cardinals blessings) but none of the same Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren did breake their necks y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer I herd,<note place="margin">

Therfore none but fooles or mad men wil refuse Gods pardons and blessings which wil make vs dye the seruaunts of God, for the Popes pardons and blessings that wil make vs dy the children of the Diuel. Thus I haue not only proued that the Popes whom you so reuerence and estéeme, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, mischieuous, the impes of Sathan, and euen the very Antichrist himselfe, but also that his religion and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is most false abhominable, and detestable, and cleane contrarie to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church of Christ and his doctrine the holy Gospel. Therefore I beséeche you refuse the Pope and his doctrine (whiche hathe made you English Enimies) and embrace Christe and his Gospell which wil make you English friends. And further you shal perceiue, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath one especial mark, that shewes perfectlye that she is the Synagog of Sathan and not the Church of Christe, whiche is hir persecuting, murthering, &amp; killing of such as wil not obey hir law, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> encreasing, maintayning, &amp; setting of hir vp. <hi>Chrisostome</hi> writes thus,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Tertullian</hi> sheweth who are the true Christians, &amp; who are not.

Now if they are not to be counted Christians, that loue but onelye their friendes: then what is the Pope &amp; his holy Prelates that hate, trouble, torment, murther, burne, and kille the friendes of Christ? hereby it must appeare that you that are of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes persecuting religion, are no true Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, and so you haue not the true religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Christ. For none but the true Christians haue the true religion And as the Pope is the very Antichrist, so they that are of his religion are Antichristians, therefore continue no longer in the Popes doctrine, for so long as you embrace hys doctrine, so long muste you néedes bée Antichristians, and no true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Christians. Therfore deceiue not your selues, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade your selues, that if you murther, kyll, &amp; persecute, you are not of Christs folde, nor any of his shéepe. For Christ was persecuted, and his Apostles were persecuted. Now if Christ y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was persecuted, was and is the sonne of God, and Christs Apostles y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were persecuted his shéepe, then they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> persecuted Christ and his Apostles, and you that persecute now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must néedes be the children &amp; the Gotes of the Diuell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> propertie of shéepe to bite or deuour, but of dogs, wolues &amp; such like.

But if they died in errour, and are damned (as some of your religion saide) then who was the cause of their damnation? forsooth euen they that condemned them and burned them, for thoughe they had bene so wilfull to burne in an euill opinion, yet they shoulde not haue bene so mercilesse, to haue burned them in that opinion,</p>
            <p>If you should sée a mad man running into a pit to drown himself, would you run after him, &amp; thrust him into the pyt?

Euen so if they had bene such heretikes as you would make them, &amp; their opinions so damnable as you report them, why did your holy &amp; religious brethren of the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> so cruelly burne them whereby they were damned? haue you no greater zeale to your brethren, but so rashly and vncharitably to sende them to hell? Euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is an horrible and dolefull thing: for they that are there once, shal be in torments vnspeakable in hell fyre for euer and euer worlde without ende.

               </gap>, vppon this condition, that all his lyfe after he shoulde weare a rope. Upon this saying the Franciscane Friers of <hi>Paris</hi> caused him to be apprehended and to be laid in prison: &amp; also iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment past vppon him that he shoulde be hanged. But he to saue his life, was content to recant, and so did: the Friers hearing of his recantation, commended him saying, if he continued so, he should be saued: and so the Friers calling vpon the officers, caused them to make hast to the gallowes to hang him vp, whiles he was yet in a good way (sayd they) least he fal againe. And so this Marchant notwithstanding his recantation, was hanged. Thus though some of you do burne men to send them to hell: yet these charitable Friers did hang this Marchant to sende him to heauen. But as your burning of vs (contrarie to your saying) doth bring vs (through Christ) to saluation: so I pray God that the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers hanging of the Marchant (contrarie to their saying) did not bring him to damnation. If the Popes Friers do hang men for iesting against them: then it is no maruell though the Popes Champions doe burne men for speaking against them in earnest. The hanging of this Marchant may well be iustice according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Popes lawe: but it is scant iustice by Gods lawe, nor by the lawe of any godly Prince. These holy Friers might learne this of the Diuell: for I am sure they neuer learned it of God. You shall sée by Christes wordes, whether you that doe this murther and persecute your brethren are of God or the Diuel. Christ saith <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer you would that men should doe to you,</hi>

               <hi>do euen the same to them.</hi> Now weigh with your selues, would you be content, that if you were heathen men or Iewes, that other shoulde burne you, and sende you thereby after to hell: I thinke not,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 5.</note> Christ saith, <hi>Blessed are the mercifull, for they shall obtaine mercie,</hi> but the Papisticall persecutors are vnmercifull tyrantes, as their burning of their brethren
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:9415:137"/>
and their saying after they be damned, do euidently declare: therfore you that are the Popes persecutors are vnhappie &amp; shal not obteine mercy, vnlesse as I said you repent in time.</p>
            <p>But we are most sure that they are not gone to Hell, as some of your sect haue both boasted and bragged, for they are vnder the Altar where the rest of the Saints &amp; Martirs be, that haue dipt their garments in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bloud of the Lambe.</p>
            <p>But if they had bin in errour or Heresie, thus you would haue serued them. And though they died willingly they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not in Heresie, and yet they died not so willingly (as the mad man I spoke of parabolically) but that they woulde haue liued, if they might with a safe conscience without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Christ. For you droue them to a mischiefe, eyther to be burned here in your fire, and to saue their endlesse life in Heauen: or else to saue their life here, and to burne for euer in Hell, who remembred Christes wordes which are these, <hi>Whosoeuer shall denie me afore men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>him also will I denie before my father in Heauen.</hi> Thus you may sée what cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell Tirantes the Pope and his partakers are, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all pittie and mercie do burne and kill vs here, to burne vs and kill vs euerlastingly in Hell. And yet the Popes for all this call themselues the Seruants of Gods Seruants: but if the Pope be such an vnderling, then he vsed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour his maister but homely, when he made him lie downe and trode in his necke: and also if the Pope be the Seruant of Gods seruants, then he is a very euill seruant, that hath killed so many of his maisters.</p>
            <p>And now you shall haue an other infallible rule that our Religion is the true Religion, and that the true professors and followers thereof are of the kingdome of God. The Popes kingdome is encreased and mainteyned with cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, murther and persecuting, but Christs kingdome increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth by humilitie, by being murthered, and persecuted: for though the true Christians are dayly killed and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yet their number is dayly increased, for kill they neuer so many, yet let them tell them, &amp; they shall finde them mo
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:9415:138"/>
in number. And so doth no other religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world but it, therfore there is no better marke wherby to know the true religion &amp; the church of Christ, than by persecution, &amp; by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing thereby.

            <p>When the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> had yéelded to graunt one church within the cittie of <hi>Rome,</hi>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel aduised him in any wise not to do so, for that they said if the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s might haue but one church within the Citie, the whole people would al become Christians, and thereby their idols churches should be forsaken. Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes that holde on the Pope &amp; his religion would cease fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their killing, murthering, burning &amp; torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting of the professors of the gospel, &amp; suffer them quietly to teach &amp; preach the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel that would, &amp; to haue the Bible &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmunion in the Churches, surely the Bible would driue away al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> images, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would quite ouerthrow their Masses, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of Gods word would vtterly confound &amp; abolish the Pope &amp; al his false doctrine.

And as Christ is mercifull, so the Pope is cruell, (not to the wicked but to the godly,) for the Pope kil them that professe the Gospell, whom God would haue preserued and not killed: but harlots, fornicators, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouterers, <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and incestuous persons, which God appointeth to be executed &amp; stoned to death, he preserueth maketh much of &amp; maintaine.<note place="margin">

that ought to liue, both by Gods lawe and mans lawe? If <hi>Peter</hi> were Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> as some of you beléeue, then marke how his doings did differ from the Popes practises: for <hi>Peter</hi> did giue sentence of death against <hi>Ananias</hi> &amp; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phira</hi> his wife the children of the Diuell, &amp; so were sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stroken to death by the powre of God for lying: but the Pope &amp; his Prelates pronounce sentence of death agaynst the children of God and burne them for speaking of truth. And thus the persecuting Pope will néedes be contrarie to Christe do and say what we can.</p>
            <p>Therefore if Christ be good as he is, then the Pope is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill as he is, for that they be so contrarie, for Christe was méeke and mercifull, the Pope is proude &amp; a tyrant,<note place="margin">

               <hi>for theires is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heeauen.</hi> Nowe if the kingdome of Heauen be theirs that are persecuted for righteousnesse, then they that the Pope persecutes for testifying the Gospell, (which is trueth and righteousnesse) are sure to haue the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen, (though the Pope tell vs they are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.) And if the kingdome of Heauen be theirs that the Pope persecutes, then surely the kingdome of Hell is the Popes that thus doth persecute them. So that by Christes owne wordes, the Pope (though he say hée can saue whom he will, and can gyue the kingdome of Heauen to whome he li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And no maruell, for he hath bene so lyberall in gyuing to so many the kingdome of Heauen, that thereby he hath quite dispossest him selfe of Heauen, and therfore he is very lyke to dwell in Hell. Wherfore if you woulde auoyde Hell, haue no desire to burne your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne, nor to persecute the professours of the Gospell, for thereby you prouoke Gods wrath, and also increase his kingdome, and get the Diuels fauour, &amp; decaye the Popes kingdome. There is no striuing against God, it can be no good bulwarke that is builded with bloud.</p>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:9415:139"/>
ouerthrow in the daie whatsoeuer you builde in the night. For when the wicked Emperour <hi>Iulian</hi> in dispite of Christ had giuen the <hi>Iewes</hi> leaue to build &amp; repaire their Temple (the Princes power assisting them &amp; no power séemed able to withstand their purpose.<note place="margin">

And then was the Gospell of Christ more bewtiful and more glorious than euer it had bene before. Thus the <hi>Iewes</hi> might haue perceyued that God was bothe angrie and dispised them and their Iewish sacrifices, though once he estéemed them aboue all other, and the Temple that he before commaunded to be buylded, and wherein he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> now he from heauen ouerthrewe and the builders thereof. Wherby they also might well vnderstand that he had an other people and Religion that he estéemed better and would fight for.</p>
            <p>And therefore séeing God ouerthrewe the building and the builders of the Temple of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be builded, and that he once so well liked: then he must néedes ouerthrowe, (as he hath begon partly well already) all the dennes &amp; buildings of the temple or church of <hi>Rome</hi> which he vtterly hates, and that he neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be builded.

            <p>But some of you haue saide, that God in the olde lawe shewed for the better crediting of the same many wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full miracles, &amp; that there haue bene many strange mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles for the confirmation of the Popes religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then belike you looke for miracles, for a religion you think without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles is nothing worth, and therfore one of your religion, said where be your signes? where be your miracles? but as Christ called the <hi>Iewes</hi> an euill &amp; aduouterous generation bicause they required a signe from heauen (that they might the better credite him &amp; his doctrine) so I can not count you a godly generation,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 12.</note> that wil not beléeue the gospel of Christ without miracles, (yea &amp; such miracles as you your selues should like.) And wil you not beléeue our doctrine without miracles? nay will you beléeue it with great &amp; strange mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles? I would you would. Wel bicause yée would so faine haue myracles, you shal haue myracles, &amp; that other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of miracles, than euer your Romish church could shewe for the confirming of hir doctrine: therfore marke them wel for they are wonderful and maruellous miracles. Our litle Bible hath driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al your great idols out of al the churches of England. Our holy Communion hath put to flight all your Masses which you thought nothing could ouerthrow. They that were blind, the Gospell hath made them now to sée clearly the craftie iuggling of the Pope: they that before were dumbe, nowe speake so plainely, and vehemently preach the Gospel of Christe. These are wonderfull myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles I thinke.</p>
            <p>But if some of you should say that these are no myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or else no great miracles to be counted of: yet I dare boldly say they are maruellous great myracles, yea and passe your miracles a great deale. For marke this well, if you had neuer knowne that fire would increase in bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and should haue suddenly séene a whole Cittie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sumed with one litle sparke of fire, and that such
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:9415:140"/>
a huge and mightie fire shoulde come of one little sparke, would you not haue thought that the same had bin a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull myracle? I thinke you would: then why should not you thinke, that the spiritual burning and enflaming (with such a little sparke of the gospell at the first) of such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of peoples hartes, consuming and wasting the idolatrie, false religion, and Papisticall superstition of Kingdomes, Dukedomes, Prouinces, and such a great number of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Cities and Townes, and the mightie encreasing of this spirituall fire (the gospell) and that within so shorte a time, is a maruellous myracle? (although the Pope and his power did what they could to quench the same.)</p>
            <p>Surely it is such a miracle in all wise mens eyes, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Pope and his power (do what they could) were not able to quench, as there can not be a greater. And there is nothing that may more better persuade you, that this our Religion is the very true Religion and worde of God, than that God so mightily defendeth it and so mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously increaseth it. This and the other miracles before mentioned are sufficient miracles I hope, for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of any Christian hart to beléeue the Gospell, yet you shall heare more miracles hereafter.</p>
            <p>And now for that you haue called for our miracles, I trust I may likewise call for your miracles. What kind of miracles were they wherby your Romish religion was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed? forsooth they were such as might make the wittie to become fooles, but oures are such as will make fooles to become wisemen. And now marke your miracles, of your Romish Churche, your Roodes and Images can speake, if they haue a false knaue stande behinde them: your Idols can roll their eies, wagge there chappes, and caste their armes abroade, if there be one behinde them to plucke there Engines: and they will sweate in Winter and colde weather if they be well oiled with Penetratiue oyles, yea &amp; your images can light their owne la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ps, which is as great a miracle as a iack of the clocke to strike on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bell: your holy
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:9415:141"/>
water can chase away Mise: and your Priestes giuing women good counsell and blessing them (for the Pope will not haue it called kissing and dallying) miraculouslie make them to be with child, your Popes pardons can make men die desperately and suddenly, your Cardinals blessings can make Bishops breake their neckes, &amp; your <hi>Agnus deis</hi> can make menne hang themselues: are not these your Romish myracles wonderfull? are they not woorthie to go for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles? yes I trow, our miracles of the Gospel are no such, they are not lyke vnto them: but this you were best to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, that our miracles before mentioned are of God, and these your miracles nowe mentioned are of the Diuell.</p>
            <p>Thus I trust I haue sufficiently proued, by Gods word, by auncient Fathers, and learned Doctours, by naturall Reason, by Argumentes, by Similitudes, by Examples, by the Popes themselues, by their owne wryters, and by persecuting and murtheryng: that the Pope and many of his predecessors Popes, was and is wicked, Diuelish, the Diuels deputies (not Christes vickars) and the verie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, and that his Religion is most false, erronious, and detestable, and cleane contrarie to the worde of God, and that the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Sinagoge of Sathan, and that all you that loue, honoure, and reuerence the Pope, and fauour, folowe, estéeme, and embrace, his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisticall abhominable doctrine, are English enimies, and that such enimies, as you excéede all other Englishe eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>For as I haue before probably declared, you are enimies to God, to his Gospell, to our Sauiour, to our Soueraigne, to our Superiours, to hir louing Subiectes, to your selues, yea and to your owne Soules. And can you thinke to reap any commoditie by being enimie to all these? if you thinke so, the Diuell doth bewitch you, it is he that doth blind you, and he only will destroie you. Therefore if you be wise, be no longer English enimies, to please the Diuell, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come English friends, to please God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:9415:141"/>And if all this will not suffice to make you abhorre the Pope and detest this diuelish doctrine, then I beséeche you, (for I wil leaue no way to wyn you) let these sewe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples chosen out of many, of the pacient suffering, ioyfully dying, and myraculous ending of the professors of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and of this our religion, persuade and allure you.</p>
            <p>And though this first and rare example was long since, yet the blessed <hi>Martir</hi> was persecuted and tormented for the professing of Christ and his Gospell, as our late perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted brethren were: and as they were all of one Religion, so the same one God did strengthen them and myraculously wrought in them. Therefore I beséeche you marke them diligently, and consider them aduisedly.</p>

And first in thy fleshe thou shalt suffer the paines, &amp;c. To whom <hi>Romanus</hi> answered: thy sentence O Emperour I ioyfully embrace, I refuse not to be sacrificed for my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and that by as cruell meanes as thou maiest inuent: bicause it lay not in Idolaters and worshippers of Diuels to enter into the holy house of God, and to pollute the place of true prayer.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Asclepiades</hi> inflamed with this stoute answere, commaunded him to be trussed vp, and his bowels drawne out. But that was not performed, but he was scourged with whippes, with knaps of leade at the endes. And in his scourging he sung Psalmes and required them not to spare him. And he spake vehemently by the spirite of God, but it was not regarded.

And then he said giue me a childe O Captaine but seuen yéeres of age, &amp;c, and thou shalt heare what he wil say. And then a pretie boy was called out of the multitude and set before him. Tel me my boy quoth the Martyr, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou thinke it reason, that we worship one Christ, and in Christ one father: or else that we worship infinite gods? vnto whom the babe answeared, That certainly whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> men affirme to be God, must néeds be one, which with one, is one &amp; the same: And in as much as this one is Christ, of necessitie Christ must be the true God: for, that there be many gods, we childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can not beléeue.

Not so quoth the hangman, if ye suspect my déede, open his mouth, and searche the roote of his tongue. The Captaine at length being confounded with the fortitude and courage of the Martir, commaunded him to be brought backe into the prison, and there to bée strangled: And so he was: where his sorrowfull lyfe and paines being ended: he now enioyeth quiet rest in the Lord, and where no Tirants can hurt him.</p>
            <p>This worthy Martir in whom God thus myraculously did speake, when his tongue was plucked out by the rootes, and in whom God thus maruellously wrought, and whom God did thus strengthen and made bolde and stoute in his cause, though his name was <hi>Romanus,</hi> yet he was not of your Romish religion, but a professor of the Gospell and of Christes religion.</p>
            <p>And as the spirite of God was plentifull in this holye Martyr and true Christian, so hath he bene most aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in our Martyrs of late, and wil be for euer in all them that professe the Gospell of Christ, and are true and perfect Christians.</p>
            <p>And now I will recite no moe examples of the auncient Martyrs, but of such as were persecuted and suffred for the professing of Christes Gospell, of late dayes, wherein you shall plainely sée, that as they were persecuted and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Christs quarrel and cause, as <hi>Romanus</hi> was, so God wrought in them, as he did in <hi>Romanus,</hi> the holye Ghost taught them, as he taught <hi>Romanus,</hi> and Christ did streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them them most wonderfully &amp; myraculously, as he streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thned <hi>Romanus.</hi> Therfore marke the most cruell and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse dealings of these Tormentors the Papistes, which they doe to shew themselues howe like they are to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Diuell,<note place="margin">

There were fourescore and eight persons that were Protestants, put all into a house togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the executioner commeth in, and amongst them taketh one, and blindfoldeth him with a mufler about his eyes, and so led him furth to a larger place, where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded him to kneéele down, which so doing, he did cut his throte, and leauing him halfe deade, he helde the bloudye knife betwéene his téeth as Butchers vse to doe, and carried the mufler all of goare bloude in his hande, and came againe to the rest, and so he led them out one by one, into that other house, and cut their throtes. And thus Butcherly he killed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al like Calues and shéepe. Whych was a dolefull and horrible spectacle to behold: who wente so humbly and patientlye to their deathes, as many wyll scantly beléeue.

            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:9415:144"/>Wherevnto the Bishop sayde he would. But Doctour <hi>Dracote</hi> his Chauncellour hearing that, sayde, my Lorde you know not what you do: you maye in no case answere for an Heretike. Then the Bishoppe asked hir if she wold recant or no, and sayde she should answeare for hir selfe. Then the poore blinde woman perceyuing this, sayde, if you refuse to take it on your conscience, that it is true you woulde haue me beléeue, I wil aunsweare no further: and desired them to do their pleasure. And then they gaue sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against hir, and so she was burned. Were not these godly and holy Fathers, and of a good and true religion, that did burne innocente people, bycause they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, that they themselues did not beléeue to be true? for if the doctrine was true that they taught and they beléeued the same: why mighte not they then haue sayde on theyr conscience that it was true? and why might not they haue aunswered for them therein to God at the daye of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente? this notable example shewes plainely that the doctrine of these persecuting Papistes is wicked and false, &amp; that they are not of the church of God, but of the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Diuell, that burned these poore blinde and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple women, and manye other, bycause they beléeued not that the Sacramentall breade and Wine was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye body and bloud of Christe and theyr wicked religion of the Pope, whyche they themselues (being learned By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes and Doctoures) dyd not beléeue nor stande too.</p>
            <p>But our Preachers of the Gospell will take on theyr conscience, and wil stand betwéen God and their hearers, that the doctrine they teach is true. Therfore this only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample (if I had writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing else vnto you) is sufficient to persuade you, that our doctrine is true, and your Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe religion is false: vnlesse you winke for the nonce by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you wil not sée.</p>
            <p>Here also is another notable example whereby you may vnderstande howe God giues his spirite of trueth to

the professors of the Gospell, hys seruauntes that dye for the Testimonie of the same: wherein you shall heare howe maruellouslye and truelye, a poore man that was burned for thys our Religion, prophesied of the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ende of his persecuter a wicked Papisticall Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie.</p>
            <p>A certaine pore man of <hi>Callais</hi> saying that he woulde neuer beléeue that a Priest coulde make the Lordes body at his pleasure:<note place="margin">

And whereas thou saist, that I shall dye a vile death, thou thy selfe shalt dye a viler death and that short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

            </p>
            <p>Now, if the holy Ghost be the teacher of trueth, then the holy Ghost did teach this persecuted member of Christe to prophecie truely, and if the spirite of Sathan be the teacher of lyes, then the spirite of Sathan did instruct Pope <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand</hi> that prophecied falsely (as is before mentioned) of the deposing of the Emperour. Wherefore, if you woulde (by this notable example and by manye other) consider what trueth the holy Ghoste dothe vtter by the persecuted professors of the Gospell, thoughe simple and vnlearned: And againe on the other side, what lyes and falshoode the spirite of the Diuel doth vtter, by the great learned Pope himselfe, his Catholike Cardinalles, and hys proude pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous Prelates: you woulde (if you loue trueth as you say) forsake them and all their falshoode and lyes, and embrace the Gospell of Christe the Touchstone of tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>

Then sayde Mayster <hi>Tyrrell,</hi> why? art thou stil in that minde, thou naughtie huswife? Mary it is time to looke vppon suche heretikes indéede. Then saide <hi>Rose Allen:</hi> Sir, wyth that whych you call Heresie, do I worshippe my Lorde God I tell you truth.</p>
            <p>Then saide Maister <hi>Tyrrell,</hi> I perceyue you wil burn gossip wyth the reste for company sake. Then sayde she, no sir, not for companyes sake, but for Christes sake, if so I be compelled. And I hope in his mercies, if he call mée to it, he wil enhable me to beare it.</p>
            <p>Then Mayster <hi>Tyrrell</hi> turnyng to hys company sayde: sirs this gossip will burne, doe you not thinke it?

Then that cruell <hi>Tyrrell</hi> taking the Candle from hir, helde hir wreaste, and the burning Candle vnder hir hand, burning crosse wise ouer the backe thereof, so long till the very sinnes crackte asunder. In whych time of hys tyranny, hée said often to hir, why whoore, wylt thou not cry? thou yong whoore, wilt thou not crye? Unto whyche alwayes she aunswered, that she had no cause, she thanked God, but rather to reioice: you haue more cause, to wéepe (sayde shée) than I, if you consider the matter well. In the ende, when the sinews brake that al the house hearde them, he then thrust hir from him violently, and sayde: Ah strong whoore, thou shamelesse beaste, thou beastly whoore, and with suche like vile wordes, but she quietlye suffering hys rage for the time, at the laste sayde: Sir, haue you done what you wyll doe? and hée sayde yea, and if you thynke it be not wel, then mend it. Then <hi>Rose Allen</hi> sayd, mend it, nay, the Lorde mend you, and gyue you repentaunce if it bée hys wil.

The saide <hi>Rose Allen</hi> being asked of one, howe she coulde suffer the painefull burning of hir hand, she saide, at the first it was some griefe, but afterward, the longer she burned, the lesse she felte, or wel néere none at all.</p>
            <p>Thus you may wel perceiue, that the Gospel that shée professed, was, and is the true religion, and that she tooke Gods quarrel in hand, or else the Lord would not haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hir this wonderfull patience, and haue strengthned hir and mitigated hir paines, in the burnyng of hir hande, as he did.</p>

            <p>This worthy member of Christ <hi>Thomas Hawkes</hi> was burned for witnessing the worde of God, at a Towne in <hi>Essex</hi> called <hi>Coxhall.</hi> A little before whose death, certayne of his friends priuily desired, that in the mids of the flames he woulde shewe them some token, if he coulde, whereby they might be more certaine whether the paine of suche burning were so greate, that a man might therein kéep his minde quiet and pacient: whyche thing he promised them to doe. And so secreatlye betwéene them it was agréede, that if the payne myghte bée suffered, then hée should lifte vp his handes aboue his head towardes Heauen, before hée

And when hée was broughte to the stake to be burned, there mildely and paciently hée addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe to the fire, hauyng a straighte chaine caste a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his middle: after whose feruent prayers made vnto God, the fire was set vnto him, in the whiche when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued long, and when his spéeche was taken away by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the flame, his skinne also drawne togither, and hys fingers consumed with the fire, so that al men had thought certainely he hadde béene dead, sodainely, and contrary to expectation, the saide blessed seruaunt of God (beyng mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of his promisse before made) reached vppe hys handes burnyng on a light fire (which was maruellous to behold) ouer hys head to the liuing God, and with greate reioysing (as it séemed) stroke or clapped them thrée tymes togither.

            <p>As this <hi>Iames Abbas</hi> was ledde by the Shiriffe towards his execution, diuers poore people stoode in the way and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked their Almesse, he then hauing no money to giue them, and desirous yet to distribute something among them, did pull of all his apparell sauing his shirte and gaue the same vnto them: to some one thing, to some an other.

            <p>While he was thus charitably occupied, and zealously instructing the people, a seruant of the Shiriffes going by and hearing him, cried out alowde vnto them, and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouslie sayd, <hi>Beleeue him not good people, he is an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike and a mad man out of his wit, beleeue him not, for it is Heresie that he saith.</hi> And as the other continued in his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admonitions, so did this wicked fellow still blowe foorth his blasphemous exclamations, vntill they came to the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:9415:155"/>
stake where he should suffer, vnto the which stake this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Martire was tred, and in the ende cruelly burned. But immediatly after the fire was put vnto him, the same fellow that did raile on him, (saying, <hi>that he was an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike and madde</hi>) was there presently in the sight of all the people stricken with a Frensie (such was the great stroke of Gods iustice on him for his blasphemous rayling) and was then madde in déede, (as he before had charged the Martyr withall) who in this furious rage and madnesse, casting of his shooes withall &amp; the rest of his clothes, cried out vnto the people and sayde, <hi>Thus did Iames Abbas that true seruaunt of God who is saued but I am damned.</hi> And thus ranne he rounde aboute the Towne of <hi>Burye,</hi> still cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Iames Abbas was a good manne and saued, but he was damned.</hi> The Shiriffe then beyng amased, caused him to be taken and tied in a darke house, and by force com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him agayne to put on his clothes: thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by within a whyle to bryng him to some quietnesse. But he (all that notwithstanding) assoone as they were gone, continued his former raging, and casting of hys clothes, and cried as hée dyd before, <hi>Iames Abbas is the seruaunt of God and is saued, but I am damned.</hi> At length he was ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a carte and brought home to his Maisters house, and within halfe a yéere or there aboutes, he (beyng at the poynt of death) the Prieste of the Parishe was sent for, who comming to hym brought with him the Crucifixe and their hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This fearefull, terrible, and moste straunge example me thinke were inough to make you beléeue, that this same <hi>Iames Abbas</hi> that was burned did professe the true
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:9415:156"/>
lawe of God and the Gospell of Christe, and that hée was the seruaunt of GOD. As this blasphemous rayler was enforced by Gods mightie power to graunte and confesse, (though before he called him Heretike, and sayd hée was madde.) Nowe if this Gods maruellous mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle hath prooued that <hi>Iames Abbas</hi> that was thus burned was the seruaunt of GOD: then it is manifest that the Religion that hée died for is the true Religion, and if his Religion were true, then our Religion sette foorth by the Quéenes Maiestie (whiche is the same) muste néedes bée true. And so your Religion of Papistrie of force muste néedes be false, which is quite contrarie to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: of whiche Papisticall religion this Sheriffes man was, when hée had the people not to beléeue <hi>Iames Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> saying <hi>hee was an Heretike and was madde,</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting there is none of you so madde as to thinke hée was of a good and true Religion when he sayde so. For sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he himselfe knewe hée was both wide and wrong, else he would not haue sayd that <hi>Iames Abbas was the true ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt of GOD and was saued but he was damned.</hi> And as they that are saued die not in a false Religion or wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly: so they that are damned die not in a true religion or godlie. And if your Papisticall religion had bene true and good, he would not euen at his death haue cried out of the Prieste that brought the Crucifixe and the hous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But if any of you be so maliciously bente agaynst the trueth by the procurement of the Diuell (as the Diuell may doe muche) to say that this same fellowe made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe madde for the nones, or that he was hyred by some Protestant to doe and say so (whiche coulde not be.)

and rare example, that will stoppe you (I hope) from eyther saying so, or thinkyng so.</p>
            <p>And as this laste myraculous example was of a man, so this nexte and laste myraculous example that I will shewe you is of a woman.

            <p>Therefore marke it well, for surely of all other, there is not a more notable example of Gods greate loue and fauoure towardes the professours of the Gospell and that dye for the same, and of hys greate furie and wrath to the Papistes that persecute and murther them, than this that I will here sette foorth as a glasse.

And when shée was dead and burned, the people began to turne homeward. It happened in the meane tyme, as these Catholike executors were busie in slaying of this sillye Lambe at the Townes side, a certayne Butcher with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Towne was as busie in slayinge of a Bull, whiche Bull hée had faste bounde in ropes readie to knocke hym in the head. But the Butcher (belyke not so skylfull in hys arte in killyng of beastes as the Papistes be in murthering Christians) as hée was lifting the Axe
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:9415:157"/>
to stryke the Bull, fayled in hys stroke and smitte a little to lowe: or else howe he did smite I knowe not, but this was certaine, that the Bull somethyng grieued with the stroke, but yet not stricken downe, put his strength to the ropes, and brake lowse from the Butcher into the stréete, the very same tyme as the people were comming in very great prease from the burnyng of the godly woman. Who séeing the Bull commyng towardes them, and supposing him to be wilde, (as was none other lyke) gaue way for the Bull, euery man shifting for him selfe aswell as hée might. Thus the people gyuing backe, and making a lane for the Bull, he passed through all the throng of them, touching neyther man, woman, nor childe, till hée came whereas the Chauncellour was. Against whome the Bull as pricked with a suddaine vehemencie, ranne full but with hys hornes, and taking him vpon the paunche: gored him through and through, and so killed him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, carrying his guttes and trayling them with his hornes all the stréete ouer, to the great wonder of all them that sawe it.</p>
            <p>Although the carnall sence of man be blinde in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the workes of the Lorde, imputing many times to blinde chaunce: the thinges whiche properly perteyneth to Gods onelye prayse and prouidence: yet in this so straunge and so euident an Example, what man can be so dull or ignoraunt, whiche séeth not herein, a playne my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Gods mightie power and iudgement, both in iust punishyng of this wretched Chauncellour, and also in admonishing all other lyke persecutours, by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to feare the Lorde, and to abstaine from the lyke cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie.</p>
            <p>These wonderfull and myraculous examples with a great number mo, (to the great comfort and consolation of the persecuted Gospellers, and to the fearing and terrifying of the cruell &amp; vnmerciful murthering Papists) the worthy godly and learned <hi>M.

            <p>I feare there are some of you (so farre drowned in that abhominable Romishe Religion and so farre in loue with the Pope, and with all things whatsoeuer he or any of his cruell crue doe, or commaunde to do) that if a mad man had chaunced to haue runne on this wicked <hi>Whittington</hi> the Chauncellour and had killed him) hurting none of all that great throng and number of people but onely him) woulde haue sayde, that the man had made himselfe madde for the nonce: and that some of the hereticall Gospellers had hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to doe it. But I trowe none of you will saye that the Bull made himselfe mad for the nonce, &amp; that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers hyred him to runne onely on the Chauncellor &amp; kill him: and to let all the rest of the people goe away safe and vnhurt.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it can not be denyed, nor by any way be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyded, but that it was the Lordes wrathe and vengeance, that lighted on this cruel and persecuting Papist, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Chauncellor. And as the Diuel procured this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Chauncellor to be his slaughter man on the sayd godly woman the seruaunt of God: So God sent this Bull to be his slaughter man on the wicked Chauncellour the seruant of the Diuel. Therefore as I said before if the pacient, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, ioyfull, and myraculous endes and deathes of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of the Gospell, can not allure nor persuade you from Papistrie to the Gospell, from the Pope to Christ, &amp; from the Diuell to God: yet let the fearefull, horrible, desperate and dolefull deathes of the Papisticall persecutors &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of the professors of the Gospell enforce, feare, and terrifie you to flie with all spéede from the Popes daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, detestable and Diuelish doctrine.</p>

shoulde heare of it, myghte playnely perceiue, that the Gospell is the true Religion, wherein GOD is chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleased, and that they that are persecuted for professing of the same, are the seruauntes of God: and that the Papistes that murther and persecute them, are the children of the Diuell.</p>
            <p>Learne therefore to confesse willingly your errours, and to recant and refuse your diuelishe Papisticall doings and doctrine in tyme, whyles you may repent, recant, &amp; obtaine mercie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by these wofull wretches that compelledly confessed their errours, and recanted their diuelish doings and doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine out of time, when they coulde not repent neither ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any mercie at all.</p>
            <p>If you could shewe vs but one of your Papistical Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that died so willingly, chéerefully, constantly, Christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, peaceably, godly, and myraculously as these professors of the Gospell before described, and thousandes of such moe haue done: then you woulde reioyce and clap your handes, noysing abroade thereby that your Religion were true, and most godly.</p>
            <p>But bycause you can not shewe vs one suche, I haue shewed you diuerse (and coulde shewe you manye moe) of your cruell persecuting Papistes, that most desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and dreadfully haue kylled and hanged themselues, and that through the great and iust iudgement of God, haue bene strucken with the Lordes mightie hande, and so haue dyed most horribly, dolefully, diuelishly, &amp; desperately, to the great terror and feare of all them that either sawe it or hearde thereof.</p>
            <p>Therefore if there be any sparke of Gods grace in you at all, then the godly, pacient, and chéerefull suffering, and myraculous and tormenting deathes of the professors of the Gospell, will not onely allure you with all spéede to lay holde on Gods worde, and to embrace the Gospell our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: but also the dreadfull, dolefull, horrible, and most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:9415:159"/>
deathes and endes of the cruell persecuting &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering Papistes, will terrifie and feare you any longer to holde with the Pope, or to followe his detestable and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable doctrine.</p>
            <p>Many of the Heathen haue onely bene wonne to become Christians, by séeing the constant and pacient suffering of the Martyrs: and will you that professe to be Christians, be wonne to Papistrie by their crueltie and tyrannie, and by their dreadfull, horrible and desperate deathes?</p>
            <p>I beséeche you therefore for the loue of God, as you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse your selues to bée Christians, so heare dayly and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the lawe of Christ, by whom you are called Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
            <p>But some of you haue saide, that we may haue too many Sermons, and too much talking of the Scriptures, if wée may haue too many Preachings of the word of God which will guide vs to Heauen: then you maye haue too many Masses which will leade you to Hell. And if you thinke it is good to heare twentie Masses in a daye which worke your damnation: then we thinke it is godly to heare one or two Sermons in a day that will worke our saluation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if you will be Christes shéepe, then muste you heare Christes voyce: and his voyce is no where else to be heard but in his Gospell. There is no lawe can teache vs Christs will better, then his owne lawe that he spake and gaue vs hym selfe. As no lawe can teache the Popes wyll and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, better then the Popes lawe: so no lawe can teache vs better to please Christ and to performe his will, then his owne lawe the Gospell.</p>
            <p>If we ment to be Papistes, wée woulde not followe the Gospell, but the Popes lawe: then if you meane to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, followe not the Popes lawe but the Gospell.</p>
            <p>But howe can you followe the Gospell, when you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to reade it, or howe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an you heare Christs voyce, when by no meanes you wil heare the Preachers of Gods word, that vtter Christes voyce: That is such a fault in you, that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:9415:159"/>
hath kept you in errour, and will kéepe you still in blynd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>Perhappes you will say that our Preachers doe preache heresie, and therefore you will not heare them. But how do you know they preache heresie before you doe heare them? it were méete you shoulde heare them before you doe blame them. But suppose that you had the true doctrine, and that our Preachers should preach false doctrine, then what néede you refuse to heare them preache? or to reade their workes or writings, for you shoulde sooner confute their heresie with your true doctrine, than they shoulde allure you from your true doctrine to their heresie. What néede a true man feare to heare a lyer speake of that thing he knoweth? he shall sooner take the lyer in a trip, than the lyer can make him beléeue his lie, why should a wise man doubt to heare a foole talke, for the wise man should rather deride the fooles folly, than therby be allured to be a foole. Therefore if your Religion be the launterne of light (as some haue not sticked to call it) and our religion the doctrine of darknesse, then the light of your doctrine, would soone bewray the darknesse of our doctrine. And so the more you shoulde heare it, the more you would despise it, and the more you shoulde reade it, the more able you would be to confute it.</p>
            <p>As he that is in a faire, goodly, swéete, beautiful &amp; bryght house, néede not doubt to goe into a darke, euill fauoured, &amp; stinking dungeon, least he shoulde be allured to tarrie there still, and to forsake the faire and trim house: euen so (if your doctrine be good and true, and the beautie and light of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther religions) then you néede not feare to heare our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of heresie, and reade our bookes of false doctrine, least you should be seduced thereby and forsake your owne true doctrine, for as the vyle darke and stinking dungeon would rather enforce him that is in it to abhorre it and quickly to goe from it, making him further in loue with the trymme bryght and swéete house: so woulde our wicked and false doctrine (if it were so) make you further in loue with your
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:9415:160"/>
owne true and godly doctrine.</p>
            <p>But for that disdainefully, obstinately, and wilfullye you refuse to heare our Preachers, and to reade our bookes, it shewes that you doubte your owne doctrine, that you are determyned to dwell styll in your errour, and that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely you wyll not come from darknesse to lyght, nor from falshood to trueth.</p>
            <p>But bycause we are most sure that our Religion of the Gospell is right and true, and your Papisticall religion is most erronious and false: wée willingly reade your bookes without anye feare to bée allured from our doctrine. Nay we reade them desirously, for that we are sure to confounde you with your owne bookes and writings. And therfore <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> the Emperour and <hi>Apostata</hi> commaunded that the Christians should not be trained vp in good letters,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cooper in Epit.

            <p>But séeyng wée haue Gods worde (whiche is the tryer of trueth and confounder of falshoode:) wée desire none other arrowes to wounde you wythall, than the same you shoote at vs, for wyth your owne dartes wée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy your doctrine.</p>
            <p>Your Popishe Religion is so erroneous, so false, so foolishe, so childishe, so vayne, so ridiculous, so tyed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wyth rotten thréedes, so farre out of square, so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to Christes doctrine, so wyde from the Apostles tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, so farre from the auncient Doctors meaning, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to reason, and so farre disagréeing with it selfe, (as before it doeth appeare) that vtterly it doeth bewray it selfe.</p>
            <p>A lyer had néede to haue a good memorie, or else he wyll soone be taken in a trippe: let a théefe premeditate his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before hande neuer so well, and cast his cardes neuer so cunningly, yet if a wise man haue him in handling, his own

tale will trippe him and trye him a théefe: (yea, thoughe before he were thought to bée a true man. For assure your selues that trueth will abyde all tryalles,) <hi>Veritas non querit angulos, trueth seeketh no corners,</hi> and trueth (as is before said) feareth nothing, but least she should be hid. And trueth doth most triumph when she co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes to tryall.</p>
            <p>And nowe for that your Romish doctrine refuseth triall, that argues, that it is not true. For if your Papisticall doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine bée so true, so perfect, and so pretious as you saye it is, and our doctrine so false, so wicked, and so hereticall as you blase abroade, then why doe you not confounde it rather wyth persuadyng than wyth punishing, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting than by destroying, by learning than with murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, by preaching than by presecuting, and by writing than with burning.</p>
            <p>Thoughe I haue written this to wynne you, and for your instruction, yet I feare some of you therefore wyll wyshe my destruction. And thoughe some of you doe barke against it, (as I thinke you will) yet I am moste sure that none of you can disproue or confounde it, for that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation whereon it is builded is truth, which no storme can shake, nor tempest can ouerthrowe.</p>
            <p>Marrie if you had our power ioyned to your crueltie, you woulde confute it and the writer thereof quickelye (if bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and kylling maye bée called a confuting.) But if you shoulde so doe, I muste bée content, the seruaunte ought not to grutche to followe his Maister: but this I wyll tell you by the waye, the greatest friende I haue in the worlde, coulde doe mée no suche pleasure as you shoulde doe mée thereby: (if the sendyng of one to heauen bée a pleasure) for Christ sayeth (whose wordes I beléeue) <hi>Blessed are they which suffer persecution for righteousnesse sake, for theirs is the kingdome of Heauen.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 5.</note> Therefore if by your burning and kylling of mée, you shoulde send me to Heauen: then surely in my iudgement, you coulde doe mée no greater pleasure.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:9415:161"/>And contrarie, all the enemies you haue in the world, could doe you no greater displeasure, than you thereby should doe to your selues, (if going to hell be a displeasure) for if they be blessed that are thus persecuted and shall enioy the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen, then their persecutors must néedes be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and vnhappie, for theirs is the kingdome of hell. And so by sending me to Heauen, you shoulde sende your selues to hell, (vnlesse you repent): but it is a more common thing to the persecutors of the Gospell, (as before you may sée if you will sée) to die desperately than repentantly.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let their dreadfull and desperate deathes driue you from the Popes persecuting Religion, hoping that these terrible and fearefull examples of Gods heauie wrath, powred on the persecuting and reuolting Papistes (if they were fewer) are ynowe to such of you as are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly ledde in Papistrie, and that will open your eyes to sée: but I feare they are too fewe for such of you, as are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately, wilfully, and purposely bent to continue in the same, and that wyll winke for the nonce, bycause you will not sée.</p>
            <p>But marke this wel I beséeche you, which of you if you did sée a man goe before you, and fall on a slipperie ground, where he may rise or be helped vppe againe, woulde not shunne that place, and séeke an other safer waye? Nowe if you will shunne with one example a slipperie place for feare of a fall, where you maye ryse or bée helped vp againe: wyll you then runne wylfully (hauing so manye examples and warnings) into the dolefull and horrible pitte of Hell, where you can neuer get out againe by any meanes? thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandes haue shunned hell with a great deale lesse warning, and will you fall into hell for all this great warning?</p>
            <p>Though you féele not the tormentes of the saide persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and dead desperate Papistes, yet if you doe and die as they died, you shall féele as they féele.</p>
            <p>But perhaps you thinke, bycause you taste no smarte, that they féele no sorrowe: Be not incredulous, and thinke
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:9415:161"/>
not that your neighbours house is not burned, bicause your house is safe and vnburned. And be not lyke fooles that will not beléeue that fire hath burned their neighbours house, before they themselues haue set fire on their owne houses, and vntill they sée them burned and consumed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their faces.</p>
            <p>It is not your harme to take héede by other: but it would be your harme for other to take héede by you. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yéelde willingly vnto Christe and to his Gospell in time, least you yéelde to Christ and his Gospell (as the said desperate Papistes did agaynst their willes) out of time. And embrace Gods mercie whiles it is offered in tyme: least it be denied you, when you would haue it out of time. And beware by the sayd desperate Papistes that are dead: but let not them beware by you that are aliue. The sayde Papists of your religion that died so horribly, dolefully, and desperately, would giue all the world (if they had it to giue) to be but one howre in your place, that they might repent: then how happie are you that are here, where you maye turne to the Gospell without giuing anything, and where you haue many houres to recant and repent? Therefore take héede in any wise that you come not into their place where you can not repent, or else cannot haue mercie though you repent neuer somuch. Detest and abhorre Papistrie with repentaunce, leaste you detest and abhorre it (as the other before mentioned haue done) without repentance.

But if any of you be so obstinate &amp; so wilfull, that neither Gods word can winne you, nor the learned &amp; godly writers can withdrawe you, nor my reasons can persuade you, nor my arguments will allure you, nor the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples I haue brought can moue you, nor the pacient, godly, &amp; miraculous suffring and dying of the professors of the Gospell can procure you, nor yet the suddaine dreadful, desperate &amp; damnable deaths of the persecuting Papistes can feare you, from your dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable and Diuelish doctrine of the Pope (which is against the law of God, the law of our Quéene, the law of Nature, and the lawe of Reason): Then I can sée none other but that you are determined to withstand God and his Gospell asmuch as lieth in you to your vtter confusion, (as they did which before I sette foorth for examples to warne you withall.)</p>
            <p>And though by writing I can do no more for you than I haue done: yet I will pray for you still as I haue done. Whiche is, that God may giue you eies to sée, and hearts to vnderstand the trueth: whereby you and we may embrace and follow the Gospell of Christ, here on earth togither: that after this life we may dwell in the kingdome of Heauen togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children of God: to whom be all honour, glory, and praise, for euer and euer. <hi>Amen.</hi>
