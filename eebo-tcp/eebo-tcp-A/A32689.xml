         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Here, <hi>Sir,</hi> You have both the
true <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> of Docility
conveniently expreſſed; but yet
you are to ſeek, whether Wit
and Docility be alwaies one and
the ſame thing. For, Docility,
if reſtrained only to Arts and
Sciences, though it neceſſarily
implyes a good capacity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
in the Perſon, by the
bounty of Nature, therewith
enriched: yet can it not be thence
inferred, that all men who want
this Docility, want alſo wit; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
then none could have wit,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59836:14"/>
but <hi>Scholars</hi> alone, and becauſe
Experience ſufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
that many laudable Wits
are naturally averſe from the
ſtudy of Letters, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
perhaps alſo incapable of
proficiency in them. So that what
<hi>Anatomiſts</hi> generally ſay of the
ſigns of Virginity, namely that
the appearance of them is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
evidence of the Brides Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity;
but the non-appearance,
no proof of her deflowerment
before Marriage; may with
equal truth be ſaid of this Doci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
it cannot be without a good
Wit, but a good Wit may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be without that. Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
You know, is but Wit culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated;
the ſeeds thereof are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and grow up of themſelves,
and many times bring forth fruits
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59836:14"/>
both pleaſant and uſeful, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of Art, eſpecially
where their Luxuriancy is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by virtuous education,
and their maturity promoted by
ingenious converſation. If wit,
then, may ſubſiſt without <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
certainly it may ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Docility, i. e.</hi> a facility of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arts and Sciences.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if we divide <hi>Docility</hi>
into its three parts newly deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
and diſtribute them among
three Men, allowing to one quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of <hi>Apprehenſion,</hi> to the ſecond
<hi>Sagacity</hi> in hunting after conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
and ſtrength of <hi>Memory</hi>
to the third: this will not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to direct us to make a
judgement, which of the three
ought to have the praiſe of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59836:15"/>
beſt <hi>Wit:</hi> becauſe therein they
may all be Equal. For, we
want not the teſtimony of daily
obſervation, that many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Wits have but weak Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and as many of admirable
Memories are yet dull of Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion;
and again many, who
are good at Ranging after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,
though it be neceſſary
that they remember well (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is from the reminiſcence
of what they have known, that
they infer what they ſeek) are
yet but ſlow of Conception.
Hereupon I am of opinion, that
Wit and Docility, though fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Concomitant, are yet
diſtinct Faculties, and therefore
require both Names and Notions
diſtinct.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>Panegyries,</hi> and <hi>Invectives,</hi>
Phanſie ought to take place; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

Metaphors, they are wholly to

is no leſs than manifeſt folly and

However, ſince we are not
forbidden with due reverence to
conjecture; You (I hope) will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
refuſe to hear my fooliſh
ſentiments concerning this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem:
eſpecially while I offer
them rather to Your Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

                  <p>When, therefore, I obſerve,
that Men are no leſs diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

each from other by the
various Inclinations, Affections
and Capacities of their Minds,
than by the diſſenting features,
lines and aires of their Faces; I
am apt to perſwade my ſelf, that
<hi>God Almighty,</hi> in making ſo vaſt
diſſimilitude, and in that diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of His ſeveral Donatives
among Individuals of the ſame
<hi>Species,</hi> intended thereby to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
Mankind to a <hi>Civil
life:</hi> it being no more poſſible for
a Society of Men, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
to be compoſed of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
all of the like endowments
of Mind; than it is for an Animal
to exerciſe various Functions
with many Organs all of the
ſame parts, ſhape and fabrick;
or for Muſical Harmony to reſult
from a multitude of Uniſons.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59836:26"/>
I am not ignorant, that even the
beſt Philoſophers, when they
contemplate the diverſity of
Natures Endowments, and the
moſt probable Reaſon thereof,
modeſtly bound their Curioſity
with this clauſe, that <hi>Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
her ſelf in variety,</hi> as well in
this as in all other kinds. Nor do I
deny what they here ſay to be
thus far true, that Nature, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Art of God, can have no
other perfection, but what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from her Author and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
whoſe Goodneſs cannot
be terminated but in it ſelf; and
conſequently all Emanations
and Effects of that Goodneſs
muſt redound to the delight of
their firſt Fountain. Yet this
(methinks) doth not oblige us
to acquieſce in that conſideration
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59836:26"/>
alone, without all reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our ſelves; there being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
ſome other Reaſon or End
of ſuch Variety, wherein Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
may be highly concerned.
I conceive, then, that the <hi>Creator</hi>
having one Eye directed to the
pleaſure redounding to Him
from the manifeſtation of His
Power and Goodneſs; aimed
with the other at ſome general
benefit and favour to Man, to
whom He purpoſed to be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
indulgent and gracious in
all things: and that fore-ſeeing
how much more ſecurely, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly
and happily Men
might live in <hi>Societies,</hi> than ſingle
and diſperſed, as wild Beaſts; He
ordained this great diverſity of
<hi>Ingenies</hi> among them, as a means
to accommodate them to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59836:27"/>
aſſiſtance and aſſociation.
But this I deliver as only proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
not definitive: and leaving
it to Your better judgement to be
approved or rejected, I paſs on
to the <hi>Natural</hi> Cauſes of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity

that ſuch indeed was the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

You have lately not only

demonſtrated by the

for that end made by him
at the command of the <hi>Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety:</hi>
and that therefore You
hope, if <hi>Anatomiſts</hi> proceed in
their diſcoveries, with the ſame
accurate ſcrutiny, and the like
happy ſucceſs, as of late Years
they have done; ſome one of
them may at length be ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
as to find out the true
uſes of all the ſeveral parts of
the Brain of Man, and ſo ſolve
all the difficulties that now
amuſe thoſe, who profoundly
conſider the wonderful <hi>Oeconomy</hi>
thereof.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>reply,</hi> therefore; that grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59836:29"/>
                     <hi>Veſalius</hi> to have been much
miſtaken in that his Opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Brain; and that there
really are thoſe Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Man and all other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
which the Book you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

abſtruſity of the Nature, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Inſtruments, and wayes of
operation of the Intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
is nevertheleſs too true.
For, You cannot but remember,
that even the Author of that
Treatiſe himſelf doth in the end
of it ingenuouſly confeſs, that
notwithſtanding his frequent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of thoſe Differences,
he was ſtill as ignorant of the
principal ſeat of the ſoul, and
what parts ſhe made uſe of in
her ſeveral Functions, as before
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59836:30"/>
he firſt entred into the Anatomick
Theatre. And were it not a
<hi>Parergon,</hi> I could collect, and here
recount many obſervations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
by Eminent Phyſicians, of
ſuch, who retained the uſe of their
Senſes, Imagination, Memory
and Reaſon, without any the
leaſt defect, even to the laſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
of life; and yet in their
Heads opened after death, there
was found (as in moſt Fiſhes)

is ſo diffuſed, that it flies
at all things; and commonly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
with prolix Eloquence,
diſcourſeth copiouſly rather than
cloſely; without premeditation
ſupplying it ſelf with words and
ſentences, as out of a treaſury in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible.
Men of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59836:38"/>
are uſually in high eſteem
with the People, if of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions

to ſhew their Copiouſneſs in
publick Aſſemblies or Councils:
nor ungrateful in private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
at leaſt when once they
have learned as well to be ſilent
at ſome times, as to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely
at others. Which they
cannot eaſily do. For, as all
Brute Animals know, by natural
inſtinct, in what part their chief
power lies, and delight in the
frequent uſe of that part above
all the reſt of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
ſo theſe Men, highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with their faculty of
Eloquence, wherein alone they
excell, are hardly brought to
obſerve <hi>Decorum,</hi> and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
when to contract or expati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59836:39"/>
when to ſpeak or hold their
peace; but carryed violently on
by an itch of declaiming on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſubject, how trivial or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
ſoever, often entangle
themſelves in Arguments above
their underſtanding, and ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate,
but not ſatisfie their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
So that even a Wiſe man
may juſtly wonder, their impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
conſidered, how they are
able to ſpeak ſo much and ſo
little at once, ſo well and to ſo
little purpoſe. Having at length
ended (not finiſhed) their fine
<hi>Harangues,</hi> they ſcarcely refrain
from openly applauding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
and if their Auditors
ſhew any ſigns of Complacency
and good Humour, they are apt
to refer it only to a ſatisfaction
of judgement reſulting from the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59836:39"/>
Elegancy of their diſcourſes,
though the ſame ariſeth rather
from Joy that they are at length
delivered from the importunity
of them. Notwithſtanding this
Vanity it muſt be confeſſed, theſe
Wits have long wings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
by a ſecret <hi>impetus</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
delight to flye abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
range over the whole field of
<hi>Sciences:</hi> but then again ſuch is
their ſpeed and praecipitancy,
they ſtay no where long enough
to <hi>examine, ſelect</hi> and <hi>gather;</hi> like
Bees in a windy day, they take
only a ſuperficial taſte of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
flowers, and return to their
hives unloaded. Whence it
comes, that while they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
of one part of Learning,
if a new hint chance to ariſe and
intrude it ſelf into their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59836:40"/>
inſtantly quitting their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Theme, they as ardently
purſue the new one; and ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
divert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to freſh Arguments,
till they have wholly forgotten
the queſtion firſt ſtarted; as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanch
Hounds, meeting with a
new ſcent, follow it with full
cry, and loſe the Beaſt firſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
And this is that <hi>Defect</hi> of
<hi>Mind,</hi> which is commonly called
<hi>Levity:</hi> ariſing perhaps chiefly
from an exceſſive <hi>Mobility</hi> of the

even Vulgar ones in ordering
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59836:40"/>
their affairs according to the
rules of <hi>Domeſtick Prudence.</hi> Some
of them becloud themſelves
with the Vapours of <hi>Philauty,</hi>
ſelf-love, and over-valuation of

prove wanting to themſelves and
Friends in ſuch offices, where
conſtant <hi>ſedulity,</hi> and ſteady ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
to one purpoſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.
For, they are naturally
light, unconſtant even to their
own Hopes, variable in their
Deſigns, fixt to nothing but their
own Opinions, in which they
ſo abſolutely confide, that they
look not into the advantages of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59836:41"/>
others propoſals and counſels.
And yet for all this ſome of

the poliſh and luſtre of their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial

at length admitted to reap that

                  <p>This Art conſiſteth principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in moderating their fervency
of ſpeaking; in frequent change

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59836:41"/>
chooſing ſuch, in which they

of matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> of
the rites and cuſtoms of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,

generally have but little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
among men bred up in

diſcourſe of the foundations and

and great actions of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a word, <hi>Let them provoke

Colloquies, it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
ſo it be dextrouſly done,
to divert to things of which the
Company is ignorant: both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
Errours then eſcape diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and becauſe Novelty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
pleaſure, and by how much
more we eſteem things of which
we never heard before, by ſo
much more do we admire him
who delivered them. But above
all <hi>let them take heed of Writing;</hi>
which to Roving and Superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Wits is as difficult, as their
Gift of ſpeaking fluently is eaſie,
and for the moſt part proves no
leſs deſtructive to their Fame,
than their <hi>ex tempore</hi> Oratory hath
been favourable. For, that
which gives due ſharpneſs and
grace to the <hi>Stile</hi> of a <hi>Writter,</hi> and
recommends it to the preſent
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59836:42"/>
and ſucceeding Ages, is exquiſite
and elaborate <hi>Judgement;</hi> which
is very rarely conjoyn'd with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
fluency of ſpeech. The
<hi>Reaſon</hi> may be this; that a
prompt, but turbulent Mind,
when in retirement (which all
know to be neceſſary to a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
it comes once to reflect
upon it ſelf, and examine its
own ſtrength; burdened with
multiplicity of things together
offering themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
with variety of
thoughts, ſoon faints under the
weight: and having neither
judgement to <hi>ſelect,</hi> nor patience
to <hi>digeſt,</hi> falls at length into Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,
or Deſpondency. In
fine, the Faculty of writing well
is ſo different from that of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
volubly, and requires ſo
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59836:43"/>
much more of both Attention
and Deliberation; that moſt of
your <hi>Fine Speakers,</hi> when once
they find the wings of their Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
clipt, and their underſtanding
intangled in ſtrong and knotty
Reaſonings, are miſerably at a
loſs how to extricate themſelves,
and deſpairing of ſucceſs, return
to their former liberty. Yet
ſome of this <hi>Claſsis,</hi> either blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſelf-conceit, or deluded
by adulation of their Admirers,
have adventured to publiſh
Books; and out of vain Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to enlarge and eternize
their Reputation by their
Pen, have utterly ruined
what they had acquired by
the nimbleneſs of their Tongue.
My advice, therefore, to ſuch
ſhall be this; that they raiſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59836:43"/>
in the World an Expectation of
ſome conſiderable Volume from
them, and keep that expectation
alive as long as they can: but
be ſo wiſe as never to ſatisfie it
with ſo much as a ſingle Sheet.
But Wits of this temper are
commonly too Hot to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate

to take caution from the
Counſel of even their trueſt
Friends: and therefore I leave

which is converſant in the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

or <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and not rather in a
ſecret <hi>Vivacity</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> and a
piercing Judgement or Reaſon
that underſtands all Languages?
To be born with a pregnant Wit,
is no ſuch high indulgence of
Nature, if no more be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
therein, than a Propenſion to,
and Capacity of Erudition Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtick.
Thoſe of the <hi>Ancients,</hi>
whom we acknowledge to have
been the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of Sciences,
and great Examples of Wiſdom,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59836:52"/>
never conſumed much of oyl
and ſweat in the ſhades of the
<hi>Schools:</hi> and yet certainly they
were born under Stars highly
propitious. To found Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
to make wholſome Laws
for conſervation of publick
Peace, to ſupport their Countrey
by wiſe Counſels, to obſerve the
Conſtitutions, Rites and Cuſtoms
of other Nations, and transferr
into their own whatever they
found worthy imitation; ſo far
to note and regiſter the motions
of Coeleſtial Bodies, as to keep a
a true account of Time, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
their negotiations
both at home and abroad to the
moſt convenient ſeaſons of the

<hi>This,</hi> this was chiefly called <hi>Science</hi>

their iron Minds by manſuetude

common ſafety and the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Right in Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
by little and little there
grew up that Knowledge, which
is called <hi>Moral</hi> Philoſophy. And
while, being disjoyned by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
emulation and contention,
they endevoured to perſwade the
People to favour and adhere to
one or the other ſide, they made
ſpeeches to them to move their
Affections accordingly; that
gave the firſt beginning and credit
to <hi>Eloquence</hi> or <hi>Oratory.</hi> In a word,
the Monuments of Hiſtory have
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59836:53"/>
conveyed down to us the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Artifices of thoſe Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
ſo as to be Precedents to our
Modern <hi>Literati;</hi> at leaſt if they
be able to bear the like weight
of cares: if not, the beſt uſe
their weaker Heads can make of
ſuch Monuments, will be only to
boaſt of their Reading, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to others; as Prieſts
ſhew Reliques of Saints, but
want the power of working Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;
or as keepers of antick
and magnificent Structures can
perhaps name the Founders and
Architects, but imitate neither.
For, to read Hiſtory only for
Contemplation, is a vain and
idle pleaſure, that leaves no fruit
behind: but to imitate the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
actions and atchievements
of ſuch worthy Patriots, that's
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59836:54"/>
true and noble <hi>Erudition.</hi> This was

                  <p>Yet if any Man (as many ſuch

that I am apt to believe, that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorinus</hi>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59836:56"/>
when he meaſured the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour by
the greatneſs of his Power. The
Story is in ſhort this. <hi>Adrian,</hi> not a
little ambitious of the fame of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Learning, acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
meeting <hi>Favorinus,</hi> an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Philoſopher, fell inſtantly
upon him with a whole Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of Syllogiſms, and preſſed
him with Sophiſtical Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
to which the wary
Philoſopher made but ſparing
and modeſt anſwers, ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated
his being overcome, and
left the Emperour to pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with his imaginary victory.
Soon after, to his Friends repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
him for making ſo weak
defence, he returned this vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>I were to blame</hi> (ſaid he)
<hi>if I ſhould not grant him to be the

                  <p>Having thus in a ſhort digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

Lecture, Meditation and all
other labour of the Brain, as
not only unneceſſary, but alſo

would habituate them to confine

their Curioſity upon Notions,
though perhaps of great ſubtlety
in ſpeculation, yet of little uſe
in the occurrents of life: nor
could they eaſily let looſe
their thoughts to other things,
which though ſometimes of an
inferiour nature, yet may be more
neceſſary to be lookt into. To
theſe therefore I am bold to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe

have this for excuſe, <hi>That all Heads

the finer and acuter the Wit is,
by ſo much the more eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
doth it penetrate into things
difficult, and divide things invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
but then again it grows the

perhaps is this; that Nature
doth rarely commit ſuch Fine
Wits to the cuſtody of groſs and
robuſt Bodies; but for the moſt
part chooſeth to lodge them in
delicate and tender Conſtitutions,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59836:59"/>
ſuch as produce the pureſt and

Again, not only the

but even their <hi>Relaxation</hi> and <hi>Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
is therefore precious; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
no ſooner are their Brains

prone to exerciſe it ſelf chiefly
in re-ſearching into the Defects,
Errors, and even the Infortunes

to delight in both aggravating

to <hi>Chymical Spirits,</hi> which

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59836:63"/>
by which they are actuated, ſeem
to be extracted, not out of the
pureſt parts of their Blood (as
other Mens are) but from their
<hi>Gall;</hi> as if they deſired to verifie
the new opinion of <hi>Sylvius de la

Excrement is the Natural
Ferment of the Blood, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to not only the Vital, but
alſo the Animal actions, in all liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Creatures, in which it is found.
Out of Self-conceit, they affect
to be thought highly <hi>Ingenious;</hi>
becauſe nothing is more neerly
allied to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the proper good
of man, than <hi>Ingenie:</hi> whence
that of the Poët, <hi>Qui velit ingenio

that he did it, <hi>non ut verum dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſceret,
quod Socrates facere conſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit;

But conſcious of their own Vices,
and ſtudious to conceal them;
they endeavour by detraction to
make it appear, that others alſo
of greater Eſtimation in the
World, are tainted with the ſame
or greater: as infamous Women
generally excuſe their perſonal
debaucheries, by incriminating
upon their whole Sex, calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
the moſt chaſt and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
to palliate their own diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
To this baſe end, they
rejoyce to expoſe the ſecret faults
of men any way <hi>renown'd:</hi> which
being no otherwiſe ſo eaſily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
as by the <hi>Pen,</hi> they addict

the moſt pernicious licence of
<hi>Cenſuring.</hi> In which inhumane pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
they are ſure to make uſe
of one, or more of theſe cunning
artifices. Having found an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to mention ſome evil,
whether true or only ſuſpected,
in the Perſon, whoſe Merits they
intend to diſparage; either they
induſtriouſly pretermit what
they know, and ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
towards the excuſe thereof;
or they pretend (forſooth) not
to believe it, when yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
the memory of it for no
other end, but that it may be
more firmly believed by others.
Where they meet with notorious
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59836:65"/>
failings, there they ſeem to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate,
and as it were to compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate
them with ſlight Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
only to diſguiſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction:
as I have heard of a
certain Courtier, who deſirous
to obſtruct the preferment of a
poor Countrey Vicar, and yet
not daring to oppoſe his Maſter,
King <hi>James</hi> his charitable incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
thereunto; ſaid to the
King, <hi>Your Majeſty may do well to
give him a better Living, for though
he hath not much of Learning, he is
a very good Fellow, too hard for all
his Pariſhioners at Cudgels, and hath
a ſingular knack in catching Dotrells.</hi>
Another of their tricks is this;
where they cannot blame the
<hi>Fact</hi> it ſelf, they ſuggeſt ſiniſtre
<hi>Motives</hi> or inducements to the
doing of it, and deprave the <hi>Counſel</hi>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:59836:65"/>
and intention. To theſe may
be added one more, no leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable;
where rumour hath
diſperſed various conjectures
concerning one and the ſame
action of ſome Eminent Man,
omitting or ſuppreſſing the
more benign and favourable,
they ſelect the <hi>worſe</hi> and
more derogatory, and largely
comment thereupon; with
deſign to pervert the belief of
their Hearers, or Readers, <hi>in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorem

ſuſpicions from the crooked rule
of their own inſincere Mind and
depraved inclinations; they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to perſwade themſelves and
others, that there is among Men
no ſuch thing as true Virtue, but
only a Shadow or artificial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
of it: thereby vainly
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59836:66"/>
promiſing to themſelves the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of ſingular acuteneſs of
judgement, and more than vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Wiſdom. If they can Eclipſe
the glory of Worthy Men, by
fomenting obſcure and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
rumours concerning their
Atchievements, or by maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
aſcribing the ſame, not to

of <hi>Latine Hiſtorians,</hi> and the <hi>Oracle</hi>
of <hi>Polititians,</hi> hath been accuſed of
<hi>Malignity,</hi> in not only cenſuring
the Counſels and Affections of
all Great Men, whoſe moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Actions, together with
their ſeveral Succeſſes and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,
he recordeth in his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
but alſo in interpreting the
ſame according to his private
Conjectures, and wreſting them
for the moſt part to ſiniſtre and
ungenerous ends or intentions:
thereby depriving thoſe <hi>Heroes</hi> of
the beſt part of their Glory,
<hi>Virtue;</hi> and leaving to Poſterity
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59836:71"/>
both Maxims and Precedents ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Cunning</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> than
of true Wiſdom and ſound Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.
Whether this Venerable
Author, to whom the World is
in other things ſo highly obliged,
hath deſerved this accuſation, or
not; I leave to Your judgement,
who are ſufficiently converſant
in his Writings to direct mine.
In the mean time, I am obliged,
in my own defence, to produce
one of his <hi>Accuſers</hi> at leaſt. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
me, then, to referr You to
that famous <hi>Critick,</hi> and excellent
<hi>Grammarian, Gaſpar Scioppius,</hi> who
in many parts of his Writings,
but more expreſly in his Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<hi>de Hiſtorici Officio,</hi> delivers a
charge againſt <hi>Tacitus</hi> of this
among other faults. You'll ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
perhaps, that <hi>Scioppius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59836:72"/>
is generally condemned for
the ſame Vice of Malignity: and
I think not without deſert; but
yet you cannot deny him to have
been a man of admirable acute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in diſcerning the faults, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and lapſes of other Writers;
nor have I any where obſerved
him to want reaſon for his
Animadverſions. So that though
I am alwayes offended at his bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>invectives,</hi> yet I confeſs, I am
often pleaſed with the Sagacity
of his <hi>Criticiſms.</hi>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59836:72"/>
were not altogether free from
this malignant Humor; what
may we think of thoſe <hi>poorer Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
thoſe <hi>Sons of Earth,</hi> who
dream of erecting <hi>Obelisks</hi> to
their own obſcure Names, only
out of the ruines of others? and

the Cancer of Envy rooted in

Aphoriſm of daily Experience;

                  <p>By this, <hi>Sir,</hi> You plainly
diſcern the great <hi>Difference</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Malignity,</hi> and <hi>Feſtivity</hi> of
Wit. For, as to this <hi>latter,</hi> which
the Greeks name <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the
French, <hi>Raillerie,</hi> and we <hi>Jeſting;</hi>
whereby a Man modeſtly and
gently touches upon the Errours,
Indecencies, or Infirmities of
another, without any ſuſpicion
of hate or contempt of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
pleaſantly repreſenting them
as only ridiculous, not odious: I
do not think it ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as a vice of the Mind, but
allowed as a Quality conſiſtent
both with Honeſty and good
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59836:74"/>
Manners, as denoting the Alacrity
of his Diſpoſition, and Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of his Spirit (both ſigns of
Virtue) and often alſo the Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
of his Wit, in that he is able
to give a delightful and new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to the abſurdity at which he
moves his company to ſmile.
Nor is it diſingenuous to <hi>laugh,</hi>
when we hear the Jeſts of others:
nay ſome jeſts are ſo facete and
abſtracted from Perſons, that it
would ſavour of too much dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
or Moroſity, not to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with their elegancy. But
when we our ſelves break a jeſt,
it is more decent to abſtain from
Laughter, as well leſt what we
ſay ſeem to occurr to our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
unexpectedly, and by
chance rather than choice; as
leſt we be thought to admire the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59836:74"/>
felicity of our own Wit, in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out that alluſion, which had
eſcaped the notice of others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
both which are obnoxious
to diſpraiſe; the <hi>former,</hi> as a mark
of <hi>ſlowneſs</hi> of Conception; the
<hi>latter,</hi> as an evidence of <hi>Self-love.</hi>
To which may be added two
other Reaſons. Firſt, whoever
laughs at his own jeſt ſpoils it, by
rendring it leſs apt to ſurpriſe the
Hearers. Then again he puts all
the company into jealouſie and
examination of themſelves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
all this (as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
obſerves, in his Book of
<hi>Humane Nature</hi>) it is Vain-glory,
and an argument of little worth,
to think the infirmity of another
ſufficient matter for his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</p>

Your curious Eyes upon an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,

the Deformities of it, and
the charming beauties of Your

have led you all this while in a

I wiſh, the Province You were
