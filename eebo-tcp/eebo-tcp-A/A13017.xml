            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Their owne worth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but gaine them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme, but I know your Honour will prize them the more for their fathers ſake: who whileſt hee was alive did ſecure your Honour by his Prayers which he did daily offer up to God, not <hi>pro for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> as a legall and dead ceremony, but <hi>pro Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> as a ſpirituall and lively ſacrifice, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of your honour and happineſſe, and now that he is dead yet ſpeaketh in theſe and thoſe other

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have made choiſe of this place of Scripture to make the groundwork of my Diſcourſe: In which, to let paſſe the former part, which hath beene handled in another place, in another manner, and to another purpoſe, I come to the latter part: Wee pray
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14151:62"/>
you in Chriſts ſtead or in Chriſts name be ye reconciled to God: wherein three princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parts may bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The condition of man by nature,</hi> and this is but imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word <hi>Reconciled,</hi> and may be thus expreſſed; <hi>Every man by nature is an enemy of God,</hi> for reconciliation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſo much.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>the dutie of man in this condition,</hi> if he will eſcape the miſery of it, The onely way is to <hi>reconcile himſelfe to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> who muſt urge man to the performance of this dutie, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be reconciled to God: I might adde ſomething concerning the firſt eſtate of man in inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie for the terme of <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling</hi> ſuppoſeth, firſt <hi>an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſecondly, a <hi>falling out,</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:14151:62"/>
and then thirdly, the <hi>reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from</hi> the latter jarring to the former agreement: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is not ſo neceſſary for my ſcope I will rather omit it: But in the ſecond point it will not be amiſſe to diſtinguiſh two things for more perſpicuitie.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>medicine,</hi> in thoſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>application</hi> in the maine duty, <hi>he ye reconciled:</hi> And then in recompenſe of this increaſe I will leave out the third point altogether, concerning the office of the Miniſter as not ſo pertinent to my ſcope: ſo ſhall there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the words ſtill three points.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>miſery of man, who is by nature the enemy of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly the <hi>remedy of that miſery,</hi> which <hi>is Chriſt our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:14151:63"/>
Thirdly, the <hi>fruite of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy our reconciliation with God:</hi> The firſt point which I ſhall onely inſiſt on is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That we are by nature enemies of God:</hi> For the further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of which I ſuppoſe the meaning of the Tearmes, as facil and eaſie, and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by every one in this place, to be this.</p>
                  <p>The firſt word, <hi>We,</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> which is the Subject of the Propoſition to be generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the utmoſt extent of the nature of meere man: <hi>The ſonnes of the mighty,</hi> and <hi>the men of the earth,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> terms the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by way of diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Filii</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <hi>filii Enos, filii viri, &amp; filii hominis,</hi> be they but <hi>filii Adam,</hi> the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> deſcended from him; <hi>All men</hi> are by nature Gods enemies.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond word <hi>by nature,</hi> the qualification of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14151:63"/>
not by force of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of nature, <hi>qua homines,</hi> but by participation of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ſuperadded to this nature, <hi>qua tales:</hi> not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as primitive and created by God, but by nature as deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved corrupt from <hi>Adam:</hi> All men came out of his loines by naturall generation, before ſupernaturall regeneration, the ſtocke of <hi>Adam</hi> being not tranſplanted into Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam, All men</hi> are thus <hi>by Nature</hi> Gods enemies.</p>
                  <p>The third word <hi>Enemies, Gods enemies,</hi> the predicate in the Propoſition attributed to the Subject, becauſe it implies a relative diſpoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two: and <hi>Inimicitia, Enmitie,</hi> as you all know, is nothing elſe but the recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call affection of a morall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>viz. Hatred</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two perſons in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable nature: in which
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:14151:64"/>
there muſt concurre thoſe three Conditions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that it is <hi>betweene two.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it be <hi>recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;</hi> for if the hatred be but on the one part, not on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is truly hatred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, but it is not properly <hi>Inimicitia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that it is onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>perſons in a reaſonable nature</hi> for the ſame reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe among them onely can be found the reflexion of the like affection of Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: for a man may hate a toade, or ſome ſuch creature, and that by a ſecret antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, yet that is not enmity, by reaſon of the defect of that condition: therefore this word <hi>Enemies</hi> I underſtand both Actively and Paſſively. Wee are enemies to God and hate him, and God is an enemy to us and hates us; and ſo in both reſpects. <hi>All men are by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14151:64"/>
Nature Gods enemies.</hi> Now to handle both theſe briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, joyntly: The ground, of both is a diſſimilitude, which is betweene God and us, as we are by nature, we are men of polluted hearts, and polluted lippes; <hi>God is a God of pure eyes that can behold no iniquitie:</hi> Wee are wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſinne and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but God is He to whom the <hi>Cherubins</hi> and <hi>Seraphins,</hi> doe moſt <hi>juſtly cry, Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Sabboath:</hi> and if the Trinity were multiplied by it ſelfe, that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, were thrice three times redoubled, as yee have it nine times written in <hi>Plantines</hi> Edition in the fourth of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> yet how farre were it from that which the Saints acknowledge in God, who are ſaid there not to reſt day nor night, ſaying, <hi>Holy, Holy, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14151:65"/>
Lord God Almighty:</hi> and how much more ſhort of the infinite holineſſe in God, whoſe Attributes are him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and therefore he is even Holineſſe it ſelfe. No marvell then ſeeing there is ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilitude betweene them, nothing on mans part but <hi>ſinne and pollution,</hi> nothing on Gods part but Sanctitie and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, no marvell ſeeing ſuch a diſſimilitude, if we ſay there is ſuch diſlike that they are mutuall Enemies: for if the morall maxime which is moſt true be received, this cannot be avoided which followes out of it by an eaſie conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, according to the Law of contraries, <hi>Similitudo eſt mater amoris:</hi> But Secondly, by the opening of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, This will better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and firſt for the former.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We are by nature enemies to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:14151:65"/>
Perhaps ſome will ſay to me here: and doe wee hate God? How can that be, that he ſhould be hated, who is the perfection of Beauty, the pitch of Nobilitie, the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of Wiſedome, the <hi>Idea</hi> of all Vertue, in a word, who is goodneſſe it ſelfe, whereas the Object of hatred is ſome evill alway: And doe we hate God who hath made this world, this all, and us in it a a little world, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14151:68"/>
and told them weeping. But I thinke by this time it is cleare enough out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſo it is, that we <hi>are enemies of God, and hate him:</hi> Now to anſwer the objection diſtinctly, and ſhew how this may be, that God may be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as an enemy, ſeeing he is goodneſſe it ſelfe, and the object of hatred is ſome evill: You muſt conſider three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the <hi>degrees of hatred</hi> which are three.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the firſt is <hi>not to love ſo much as we ought,</hi> or not ſo much as ſome other: and ſo the beloved Wife, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are diſtinguiſhed in the Law, where is not meant that ſhe is abſolutely hated, but not ſo much loved as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and from this degree may ariſe this diſtinction of hatred, that is, either <hi>abſolute</hi> or <hi>comparative.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:14151:69"/>
Secondly, the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is, where there is <hi>no love at all,</hi> and in this caſe this is ſufficient from this negation, to conclude an affirmation of the contrary, for betweene love and hatred in reſpect of God, there is no <hi>Medium ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negationis,</hi> according to our Saviours ſpeech: <hi>He that is not with me is againſt me:</hi> And from this degree you may frame a ſecond diſtinction of <hi>Hatred,</hi> that it is either <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> or <hi>Poſitive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the third degree is a <hi>poſitive ill-will or hatred,</hi> where there may be conceived a great latitude, and ſo many degrees likewiſe: but it will be ſufficient to declare the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, if you obſerve but one diſtinction: for this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive hatred may be either <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely</hi> ſuch, or <hi>implicitely,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>formaliter,</hi> or <hi>interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivè:</hi> by the former I meane
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14151:69"/>
ſuch hatred as a man enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines againſt any thing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, and upon actuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and intention: by the latter, ſuch as (although the former be not ſeene) by which a man doth the ſame things in effect, as if he did purpoſely hate a thing: <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me hateth his owne ſoule,</hi> ſaith Wiſedome, <hi>Prov. 8. All they that hate me love death:</hi> not that any man hateth his owne ſoule ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely or purpoſely: for <hi>no man ever yet hated his owne fleſh,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. much leſſe his ſpirit, his ſoule: neither doth any man love death in that manner: but they that doe thoſe things which proceed indeed from hatred (though they intend not ſo much) are ſaid to hate <hi>interpretativè:</hi> So the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>He that ſpareth the rod hateth his ſonne:</hi> becauſe if
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:14151:70"/>
he hated him, he could not doe him a worſe turne: And thus you have a third diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of hatred, that it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is the firſt thing to be conſidered, <hi>the degrees,</hi> or if you pleaſe, the ſeverall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of hatred.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſecond thing is the <hi>degrees of Corruption</hi> which is to be found in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man: which be two, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the two kindes <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall</hi> and <hi>Actuall,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Originall</hi> is equall in all men: for it containes in it all ſinnes, and all degrees of ſinnes, <hi>tanquam in origine,</hi> and that I may ſo ſpeake, <hi>tanquam in ratione ſeminati:</hi> but</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Actuall</hi> is diverſe in diverſe men; in ſome more, in ſome leſſe, and that not from any ſpeciall, which is in one man more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14151:70"/>
by nature, for all (as I ſaid) are equally poyſoned and infected with the bitter roote of Originall ſinne, but from the Generall Grace of God, who in his providence doth bridle and reſtaine that unlimited boundleſſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of ſinning, as it ſeemes good to his owne wiſedome, by <hi>civill education,</hi> and <hi>morall inſtructions</hi> and the like; and doth not adminiſter thoſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions which ſhould ſerve to educe it into acts, which if they were applyed to all alike, all would be alike, as ranke in ſinne one as another. And this is the ſecond thing, the degrees of corruption.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the third thing to be conſidered, is concerning the <hi>Object of love or hatred, Good or Evill:</hi> which are of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt <hi>Abſolute,</hi> as they are in their owne nature: and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:14151:71"/>

or unconvenience? theſe three things being premiſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the faculty, and the degree of corruption in it, and the object with the kindes of good or evill in it, and the affection or habit of hatred, in the degrees of it, it is not hard to anſwer the queſtion, and declare how it comes to paſſe that man by nature ſhould be Gods enemy and hate him: and thus you may take it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All men,</hi> that are yet in their originall corruption, be the degree of their actuall, what it will, more or leſſe, cannot chuſe but hate God in all the degrees of hatred, Comparative, Negative, Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: though in ſome more appeare, in ſomeleſſe: in thoſe namely whoſe actuall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is improoved more through Gods juſt judgement, there it appeares more foule,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:14151:72"/>
and more cleere, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely, who harden their forehead, and with ſet malice fight againſt God: in thoſe whom Gods bridle of reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning grace hath curbed, more or leſſe, and but implicitely, according to that explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I gave before: and the ground is manifeſt out of that which hath beene ſaid before in generall; now, not for any evill that is in God, but for that good rather, becauſe they being evill, there is no congruity or convenience betweene them and it: And as there be two things in them Firſt <hi>A Love</hi> to <hi>Malum Culpae,</hi> and ſecondly an <hi>Hatred</hi> to <hi>Malum Poenae:</hi> and two things in God, cleane oppoſite to thoſe, firſt an <hi>Hatred</hi> to their <hi>Malum Culpae,</hi> and ſecondly a <hi>Love</hi> to their <hi>Malum Poenae,</hi> ſuppoſing the other: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer flowing from his <hi>Holyneſſ,</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:14151:72"/>
the latter from his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> they muſt needs hate him in both reſpects: As <hi>Author legis</hi> prohibiting all <hi>Malum Culpae</hi> which they love, by ſevere lawes, and as <hi>ultor peccati</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting upon them <hi>Malum Poenae</hi> which they hate, vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating their <hi>Malum Culpae</hi> by ſharpe puniſhment: and theſe are ſo predominant in them, that they caſt an aſpect of deformity upon other the moſt lovely attributes of God, an aſperſion of bitternes upon the moſt ſweete among them: ſo that his infinite perfection, and incomparable mercy, are ſo farre from altering and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting them, that they drive them further from him; becauſe though they can ſee in them <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14151:73"/>
therefore they thinke they doe, as indeed they doe, make ſo much the more againſt them: and hence it is, that though they cannot hate God for them directly, yet they hate him with them, and indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for them; as infinitely ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating by accident, the hainouſneſſe of their crime, as well as the grievouſneſſe of their condemnation: And thus you ſee the truth is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the objection ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: which if it be not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently opened out of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the word, and the generall ground of mans ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe, I will further ſhew how that makes a man enemy to God.</p>
                  <p>And firſt you may eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it out of the <hi>generall nature of ſinne:</hi> which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo oppoſite to God, the love of it muſt needes argue the hatred of God: for as our

Saviour requires obedience as a tryall of the truth of his Diſciples love to him, <hi>If you love me keepe my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> Then the Argument will be as ſtrong to conclude backeward, <hi>If you keepe not Gods Commandements ye hate him.</hi> But this hath beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated already: the ſecond more particularly, <hi>Sinne is enmity to God,</hi> and that two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Immediately</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Secondly, <hi>Mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Immediately,</hi> againſt in all thoſe three degrees of hatred; which I mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Comparative Hatred;</hi> which is, when ſomething is preferred before God in our affection, and prized above him: and this is done in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſinne, otherwiſe how could it come to paſſe that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:14151:74"/>
we ſhould cleave to it, or any inferiour thing rather then to God, nay forſake God to cleave to it? How could we diſobey God to obey a filthy luſt: and that this is truely hatred, appeares by that of our Saviour, <hi>Matth. 6. 24. No man can ſerve two Miſters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or elſe he will hold to the one and deſpiſe the other. Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon, nor God and pleaſure,</hi> and the like: Where you ſee ſuch an oppoſition, that if we love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing beſide God, ſo as to be a ſervant to it, we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the love of God that ſhould make us his ſervants, we will hate him: we muſt be ſo farre from ſerving any thing before him, that we have no liberty to ſerve any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide him, if we meane to ſtay in his ſervice, this Text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes not onely all ſuperiors
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14151:74"/>
that may outſtrippe him, but all equalls that may compare with him, yea all comportures and competitors with him in our love and ſervice: If this be not plaine enough then that is, <hi>Mat. 10. 37. He that loveth Father or Mother more then me, is not worthy of me:</hi> compared with <hi>Luke 14. 26. If any man come to me, and hate not his Father and Mother, and Wife and children, and brethren, and ſiſters, yea and his owne life alſo, he cannot be my Diſciple:</hi> Whence it appeares that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſer love is but hatred, and ſo to love any thing more then God, is to hate him; and the reaſon is plaine, both in generall becauſe if thoſe two ſo unequally loved ſhould come to thwart one another, then to ſhew the love to the principall, they would not ſticke to doe reall acts of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt the other, and ſo
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:14151:75"/>
diſcover themſelves: and in particular becauſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite eminency of Gods goodneſſe above any other thing, and ſo of our obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to proportionable love: But I need not ſtay long in this: it being ſo plaine that men by nature are wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from God and convert themſelves to the creature, and therefore enemies and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is of <hi>Negative hatred,</hi> namely, where there is no love at all: and this is eaſie to be obſerved in all naturall men toward God: for whereas it is the nature of love whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is rooted to have the command of the whole man, and ſway it as it liſteth, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affections, and faculties, and parts giving attendance to it as their Queene and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne: and in the love of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:14151:75"/>
God this is to be ſeene in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner: and therefore we are commanded to <hi>love him with all our heart, and all our ſoule and all our might; and all our minde:</hi> The underſtanding, the will, the affections, all the faculties of the ſoule together, with all the powers of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, muſt be wholly taken up with this love, you ſhall find that none of theſe in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man, are any thing of kin to the love of God.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14151:76"/>
eſpecially <hi>animus eſt ubi amat potiùs quàm ubi animat. Where it loves rather then where it lives:</hi> But is there any ſuch thing in the wicked toward God? No ſurely, <hi>All things</hi> concerning him are meere ſtrangers with them, and very unwelcome gueſts, that marre all their mirth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The wicked will not ſeeke after God, God is not in all his thoughts, Pſal.</hi> 10. 4.

or more <hi>madneſſe,</hi> but this I thinke you all conceive that it is the toppe and heighth of both: But ſo it is with every ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> in his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall condition, by the ſame reaſon that he is the <hi>Heire of Originall,</hi> and the <hi>Father of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall ſinne,</hi> his ſoule and all the powers thereof, being but a <hi>ſhop of ſinne,</hi> his body and all the parts of it <hi>tooles of ſinne,</hi> his life and all his actions of both ſoule and body, <hi>a trade of ſinne,</hi> by the ſame reaſon.</p>

which we would doe, if we did purpoſe and intend hatred againſt God, the uſe and ground of which I then ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you out of ſome; places of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, remember the <hi>difference of the degrees of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in men: for though all men be equally infected in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the roote and originall of ſinne; yet it doth not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually breake forth into actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but in great variety, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they be more or leſſe bridled and curbed by Gods reſtraining grace: which makes that though all men have the ſeedes of all ſinnes, and all the degrees of ſinne in them, yet they doe not bud and bring forth fruite in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; Theſe things being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, I ſhall eaſily cleare the point in hand, which in plaine termes is this.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Sinne</hi> (in which all

                     <pb n="144" facs="tcp:14151:83"/>
but rather makes that other kind, which they uſe to call <hi>odium abominationis,</hi> which is not needfull to finde in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners toward God: yet becauſe it doth indeed agree to them, and therefore to ſet it out ſo much the more fully; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it then agrees better with the deſcription of love alleaged out of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and therefore to parallell it more fitly, I would not omit it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>That all naturall men doe wiſh and worke all evill to God,</hi> and therefore <hi>are direct enemies and haters of him.</hi>

that we finde in the creature to him: Removing all imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: I will inſtance in three good things, wherein they goe about to wrong God.</p>

                  <p>The firſt then is the <hi>diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God: Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, and ſo it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14151:86"/>
for the unregenerate man butto diſpleaſe God: their beſt actions ſtinke in his noſtrills, <hi>The prayers of the wicked is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord;</hi> in the <hi>Proverbes, My Soule abborreth your new Moones and appointed feaſts, they are a trouble unto me, I am weary to beare them,</hi> as the Lord himſelfe complaineth of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi> 1. 14.

And the Prophet threatens in Gods
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14151:86"/>
name, 1 <hi>King. 14, 15. The Lord ſhall ſmite Iſrael, and ſhall roote him out of this good Land, becauſe they have made their Groves to provoke the Lord to anger:</hi> and <hi>Ieroboams ſinnes,</hi> wherewith he ſinned againſt God are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the ſame Booke 15. 30. His <hi>provocations wherewith he provoked the Lord God of Iſrael to anger:</hi> And in the ſecond Booke, 17. 17. Where you have a Catalogue of the ſinnes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> this concludes all: <hi>They cauſed their ſonnes and their daughters to paſſe through the fire, and uſed divinations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments, and ſold themſelves to doe evill in the ſight of the Lord, to provoke him to anger. Therefore the Lord was very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with Iſrael, and removed them out of his ſight.</hi> Out of which places you may ſee what is the iſſue of the ſinne of the wicked, what the ſcope, upon which their wit, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14151:87"/>
will, and wayes, are wholly ſet, namely to provoke the Lord to anger: and that ſinne in this reſpect is enmity to God, and ſinners enemies, I thinke it is plaine enough: for is not this enmity to doe all things, that we know will thwart and croſſe a man, and to omit and neglect any thing, that might in any ſort be to his liking: to delight to grieve, and vexe, and fret him? which the wicked doe in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I might further illuſtrate this, from another peeviſhneſſe, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath obſerved in our nature, which is ſuch that the <hi>Law of God,</hi> which ſhould be a bridle to reſtraine and curbe our lawleſſe luft, is a ſpurre to provoke and pricke it forward to runne more violently; the more God forbids ſinne, the more we bid for it, the more
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14151:87"/>
greedily we deſire it, <hi>Sinne</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 7. 8. Taking occaſion by the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence: for without the Law ſinne was dead, for I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live without the Law once, but when the Commandement came, ſinne revived and I dyed, And the Commandement, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death, for ſinne taking occaſion by the Commandement, deceived me, and by it ſlew me:</hi> As if we did ſinne upon purpoſe, ſo much the more, becauſe it is offenſive to God, to diſpleaſe him, and as you had it even now, to provoke him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and if God had need to deale with us, as he did in the ſtory, who was wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the contrary, when hee would have any thing done, becauſe he knew they would croſſe him, and as the Philoſopher couſend <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:14151:88"/>
who thinking that he would make ſute to him to reſtore his Country, which he had ruined (from which he was utterly averſe) when he ſaw him come toward him ſwore he would deny whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhould deſire, and he therefore demanded the cleane contrary of what he intended, that he would not reſtore his Country, and by that wile ſped in his ſute becauſe he did not ſpeed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I might further preſſe this, becauſe our diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is ſuch naturally to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, for the moſt part, as we will be moſt <hi>refractary,</hi> in thoſe things which he <hi>moſt earneſtly requires at our hands:</hi> if there be any ſervice more pure to him, any perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ours more precious then other in his ſight, any duty that he delights in, we are more aukward and unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14151:88"/>
to that, as if we did it of purpoſe to diſpleaſe him, and to provoke him to anger, and I could inſtance here parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, in the <hi>Sanctifying of his day,</hi> in private and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent prayer, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like, but this that hath beene ſaid already may ſuffice concerning the firſt, the diſpleaſing of God, to ſhew that it is a character of enmity, a badge of hatred: and as it is ſaid in the Goſpell of the Tares, ſowne while the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman ſlept <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath done this,</hi> ſo the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that doe this continually, may be branded in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with this marke, and knowne to bee an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſecond act of enmity whereby the wicked men ſeeke to bring evill upon God is by <hi>diſhonouring him:</hi> which they doe in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14151:89"/>
many wayes, both in <hi>conceiving very meanely and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of him in their minde,</hi> or elſe they could not ſinne, and ſo <hi>ſpeaking diminitively of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie,</hi> yea, <hi>blaſpheming his holy Name;</hi> as alſo in the very ſinne it ſelfe, which as it brings a <hi>deformity</hi> upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is <hi>diſhonourable</hi> to him as the Creator, and as it is a difformitie from his holy Will, and diſobedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is diſhonourable to him, as the King and Governour of all things; for as the mangling and defacing of ſome noble Pictures, robs the Artificer of his deſerved praiſe, and ſo tends to his diſgrace: and as the diſobedience of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects is a diſhonour to their Soveraigne: ſo we blurring and mangling of our owne ſoules with ſinne, and the Image of God in them, doe impaire the glory of his Wiſedome and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:14151:89"/>
Workemanſhippe of which hee made them to have beene Statues and Monuments, and rebelling againſt him, deny him the glory of his power and Soveraignetie, and make both his Wiſedome and Power to be called in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the defects that be in us, redounding in ſome ſort to the diſcredit of him that made us, as though hee wanted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power or wiſedome to have prevented, or to redreſſe it. Now ye know that <hi>God made all things to his glory,</hi> and he is moſt tender of his honor, and therefore to deprive him of that is the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity we can offer him, and muſt needs proceede from the greateſt enmity: Wee cannot adde any thing indeede to the glory of God, who was all glorious in himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was made, and ſtands not in neede of the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14151:90"/>
creature; much leſſe can wee dimme or diminiſh it, but we are ſaid to glorifie him, and he takes it ſo, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it ſo, when wee doe according to the preſcript of his Will, the proper end of our creation: and then wee diſhonour him, when wee tranſgreſſe and ſwerve from that, as much as lies in us, though God cannot ſuſtaine any loſſe in this neither, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is able to correct our active injuſtice, by his vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative juſtice, and ſo reduce them to his glory, and then when wee will not glorifie him, yet hee will be, and is glorified by us: Now both this and the former, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing and diſhonouring of God argues the deeper ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in us, becauſe they are joyned with contempt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in that we doe theſe things and ſinne, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14151:90"/>
Gods command, his promiſes, his threatnings, is not this open contempt, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines it: <note n="b" place="margin">

                     <hi>Diſdaine is an action of glory about that ſeemes nothing worth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in that we doe it in his preſence, and before his face, as it were.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that wee doe it upon ſuch beggerly termes, for ſo little advantage to our ſelves: The firſt ſinne, was it not for an Apple; and are wee any wiſer Merchants, who <hi>exchange God and his favour</hi> for as <hi>ſmall trifles</hi> for a little brutiſh pleaſure, for a little red earth, for a ſhadow of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, &amp;c. which argues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite contempt of the infinite Majeſtie.</p>
                  <p>But I paſſe to the third. Thirdly, evill which carnall men labour to bring upon God, which is of loſſe and dammage, and that of his
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:14151:91"/>
Kingdome: <hi>Thou Lord God Almighty art King of Saints, Revel.</hi> 15. 3. and there God reigneth in a more particular manner, where his Lawes are obeyed; but they that diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, caſt off his yoake, and acknowledge no ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him: and they rebell and fight againſt him, and ſo are enemies in all properties, and he accounts them ſo, as you ſee in the Parable, <hi>Luke 19. 14. But his citizens hated him, and ſent a meſſage after him, ſaying, we will not have this man to reigne over us:</hi> and the <hi>noble man</hi> at his returne, ſaith, <hi>v. 27. But thoſe mine enemies which would not have that I ſhould reigne over them, bring hither and ſlay them before me:</hi> yea, they doe not onely breake their allegeance to God, and breake out into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt him, but even depoſe him, and ſet another

And this leads me unto the laſt Conſideration, whereby wee
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14151:92"/>
may diſcover their hatred to God; for you may remember that I told you the laſt time, that wee might take notice of their affection, both as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected <hi>God immediatly;</hi> which wee have hitherto treated, and mediately as it is carried to ſome other thing: and that is of two kindes, the enemies of God, and the friends of God: for <hi>Amicorum omnia ſunt communia;</hi> but more eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have <hi>common enemies,</hi> and <hi>common friends:</hi> And therefore hence wee know the hatred of carnall men to God, firſt, in that they <hi>love Gods enemies, the Fleſh, the World, the Devill,</hi> and all ſuch men as yeeld their ſervice and obedience to them, and that in ſo high a degree, that they rob God to pay them, that which they never owed them: They make them their King, they honour them, they pleaſe

them: they love them with all their heart, and all their mind, and all their ſtrength: which are due onely to God; like ſome impudent whores, that beſtow all their Iewels which they had received as love tokens, from their loving husbands, upon their luſtfull lovers; As the Lord alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> by the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel, 16. 17.

willing to heare of a parley, much leſſe of a peace: and this place is proofe enough of it, where you ſee how farre the Lord is forced as it were to condeſcend and yeeld to our untowardneſſe, when his Ambaſſadours, to whom he hath committed the word of reconciliation, ſay thus, <hi>We are Ambaſſadors for Christ,</hi> as if God did beſeech you by us.

                  </p>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14151:96"/>
to remove one objection, one ſcruple leſt ſome may happily ſtumble at it: and that is this.</p>
                  <p>How can God whoſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is himſelfe, who is a moſt pure and ſimple Act, and therefore <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is tender love to mankinde, is particularly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4. be ſaid to hate men? or admit that too <hi>de poſſe,</hi> that it may be, how can this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare true <hi>de facto eſſe,</hi> when as without controverſie the elect of God, whom he loved from all eternity, never fall from that love, no not while they are in the ſtate of nature, and for the Reprobate, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes many favours upon them in the things of this life,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14151:96"/>
and offers freely and truely to them, at leaſt many the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of eternall life and happineſſe; and ſo that it is their fault that they have it not? There be three branches you ſee of this objection, which I will anſwer as I can, briefely and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the firſt, there is no great difficulty: The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer conſiſting in two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered two wayes. Firſt, as he is in himſelfe, and his owne excellency. Secondly, as he hath revealed himſelfe, and ſo as it were bowed himſelfe downe to our capacity, in the former conſideration, as in himſelfe he is a <hi>ſimple eſſence,</hi> and <hi>pure act,</hi> without any compoſition of matter and forme, and without all diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and variety of qualities,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14151:97"/>
he is onely that which he is, and thus we cannot at all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him but in the ſecond as he hath revealed himſelfe, ſo we may diſtinguiſh many attributes in him, which he hath taken to himſelfe: That what we could not graſpe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we may by parts in ſome ſort lay hold of: As <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> paſſed the river <hi>Euphrates</hi> by dividing it into many ſmall ſtreames.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſecond thing to be conſidered, is that among thoſe things that are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to God from the creature: ſome things are <hi>ſimply</hi> perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſome involve ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection in them alſo, or perhaps better, ſome thing in them is conceived as a perfection, to which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding there cleaves ſome imperfection alſo: here we muſt ſever the one from the other, and aſcribe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14151:97"/>
to God, but proſcribe and baniſh the imperfection: As in this caſe, <hi>Hatred</hi> is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to God, being taken from living, eſpecially reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures: as it imports a diſlike of evill, ſo it notes a perfection; but as it conno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates a diſlike by way of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or perturbation, as it is in the creatures, ſo it hath a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of imperfection: in the former ſenſe it is properly given to God, in the latter it cannot: thus you ſee the firſt part how hatred agrees to God: as an Attribute taken from Analogy to the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature, being a ſimple diſlike, and averſion from evill without any motion or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation,</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, how God can hate any of his creatures, eſpecially man.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, man may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered two wayes, firſt as <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
                     <pb n="174" facs="tcp:14151:98"/>
and ſo; God ſaw all things that they were good, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, and above all, man, whom he had made according to his owne Image. Secondly, as <hi>corrupted</hi> and defiled with ſinne, and God, who is a God of pureſt eyes, who is not a God that delighteth in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, cannot chuſe but abhorre him.</p>
                  <p>The third is ſomething harder, and ſo the place, though it be alledged but out of the Apocrypha, <hi>God bateth nothing that he hath made,</hi> may be ſatisfied: not ſimply in it ſelfe and for it ſelfe, but yet he hateth <hi>Sinne</hi> in man, which is not of his making, and man ſecondarily for his ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the third is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what harder. How this is true, ſince neither Elect nor Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate are hated by God, though in the ſtate of corruption: for the Elect I anſwer they may be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14151:98"/>
conſidered two wayes, firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Gods eternall counſell</hi> and ſecret will toward them, and ſo he is unchangeable, he loves them from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end, from eternity to eternity, <hi>Whom God loveth once, he loveth to the end: Iob.</hi> 13. 1. <note n="b" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>For the gifts and calling of God, are without repentance, Rom.</hi> 11. 29. There is no interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this love, much leſſe blotting out of the Booke of life. <hi>Nulla litura in deretis ſapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> as the <hi>Stoickes</hi> were wont to ſay. <hi>I have bleſſed him, and he ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> as <hi>Iſaack</hi> ſaid of <hi>Iacob. Quod ſcrip ſi ſcrip ſi,</hi> that <hi>which I have written, I have written,</hi> as <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſecondly the elect may be conſidered according to Gods revealed will, and ſo during the time of their corruption, he reveales no other, but that he hates them: And he may be
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14151:99"/>
truely ſaid to hate them in two reſpects, or with a double hatred.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as they <hi>are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Odio paterno,</hi> as a Father may be truely angry with his child, and during that ſtate be ſaid to hate him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as they are in <hi>Chriſt, Odio inimicitiae &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prio,</hi> as one doth his enemy: the former may be conceived in three reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Ex quoad parte termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> that I may ſpeake ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſees nothing in them which hee can love, being all over-ſpread with ſin and corruption, nothing but what he may moſt juſtly hate:</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Ex parte effectus,</hi> becauſe hee gives no ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing but diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and hatred, neither cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to ſh ine upon them,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14151:99"/>
not ſo much as giving them a good looke, much leſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing his favours upon them in that manner that hee doth where hee loveth; but on the contrary in token of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure many times ſharpely correcting and chaſtizing them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Ex parte ſenſus,</hi> which followes from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer two, becauſe he behaves himſelfe towards them, that they gather no comfortable aſſurance of love toward them, but evident tokens of wrath: and thus hee may bee ſaid to hate them, as they are conſidered in themſelves with a fatherly and improper kinde of hatred: but ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they have Chriſt their ſuretie, ſo hee hates them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and properly, ſo that hee will inflict the utmoſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon that their ſinne, juſtice doth deſerve, which
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:14151:100"/>
being conſidered as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and undergone by them in the perſon of Chriſt their ſurety, then his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them is grounded upon a new title: for beſides his free mercie of <hi>predeſtination,</hi> he loves them now in <hi>juſtice,</hi> as juſt by vertue of <hi>Christs purchaſe</hi> and Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Now ſecondly, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place for the <hi>Reprobate,</hi> I ſay that God doth abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſimply hate them in the ſtate of naturall corruption: neither doth his favours of this life temporary confer'd upon them, nor eternall of a better offered unto them prove the contrary: for the favours of God are of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Common,</hi> which are indifferently diſtributed to all out of his generall bounty and liberality.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Speciall,</hi> ſuch as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:14151:100"/>
are proper and Peculiar to his elect, both thoſe are of the former kinde, and all ſuch gifts as in Gods Decree have no neceſſary and infallible connexion with everlaſting life, and ſo no marvell if the Reprobate have part in them as well as the Elect or rather: <hi>God cauſeth his Sunne to ſhine, and his raine to fall upon the evill and the good, the just and the unjuſt, Matth.</hi> 5. 45. for theſe are ſuch things, <hi>as a man cannot know love or hatred by them, Eccle.</hi> 1. 9. The Papiſts abuſe this place to prove that no man can know whether we be in the ſtate of grace or no; but <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> affirmes not that, but onely thus much at the moſt: no man can know it by all that is before them, as our Tranſlation hath it, that is, by outward and common favours; for <hi>Iunius</hi> reads it cleane otherwiſe, onely thoſe
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14151:101"/>
are ſpeciall favours, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods ſpeciall love which are conjoyned with everlaſting life, as faith, and other ſaving graces, and thoſe belong onely to the Elect. And thus having removed this dead <hi>Amaſa</hi> out of the way which might have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered our march; I goe on to the proofe of the Point: <hi>That God is an enemie to all men in their naturall corruption, and doth hate them:</hi> I will not trouble you with many places of Scripture heaped up, becauſe all that have beene produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the former Point, doe give witneſſe to this alſo, the terme <hi>Enemy,</hi> as I then ſhewed importing a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call affection of hatred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two: two or three ſhall ſuffice: and firſt, that place I thinke is moſt pregnant in the <hi>Epheſians 2. 3. We were by Nature children of wrath, even
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:14151:101"/>
as others;</hi> where the Apoſtle ſaith, that both the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and others, even all men are children of wrath: which implies two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that wee are ſubject and obnoxious to the wrath of God and the heavy effects of that eternall condemnation, for both, I thinke, are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the word wrath.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that we are borne ſo, which is the meaning of the other word, ſonnes or children of wrath; and to ſet that downe yet more expreſly, there is another word joyned with it, by nature, <hi>We are by nature children of wrath:</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Rom. 5. 18. By the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceof one the fault, as the old Tranſlation</hi> ſupplies the Text, <hi>judgement,</hi> as the <hi>New, came on all men to condemnation;</hi> and in the 12. <hi>verſe, By one man ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne; and ſo death paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14151:102"/>
upon all men for that all have ſinned:</hi> Againe, <hi>Gal. 3. 10. For as many as are of the Law are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the curſe, for it is written, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is every man that continueth not in all things which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Booke of the Law to doe them:</hi> and ſuppoſing that all are borne in ſinne, you have a plaine and literall teſtimony, <hi>Pſa. 5. 5.

out of all other places that have beene alleaged.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ground of Gods enmity to us for our ſinne as it is hatred of him, is contained in the former, and needes no further explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But now for the further illuſtration and confirmation of the whole Point, that God is an enemy, and hates men as in the ſtate of ſinne and corruption; three things may be conſidered, out of which will appeare, both that it is, and what it is, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it conſiſts, and what are the fruits of it.</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>The two former I will paſſe over now, becauſe I meane

to make uſe of that which I thinke needfull and pertinent in them, in a more oportune place: onely remember what hath beene delivered in the former point, that may helpe to the underſtanding of them.</p>
                  <p>I come to the third and laſt of them, the <hi>Puniſhments which God in his juſt wrath againſt ſin,</hi> and hatred of it doth <hi>inflict upon ſinners:</hi> which if you will ſee how great and grievous they are, take but a view of them three wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in ſome particular and remarkable examples.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the generall nature and kindes of them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in one ſingular, which hath both undergone, and overcome them all, <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And by this, Gods deteſtation of ſin, and ſinners for ſinnes ſake, will be ſufficiently manifeſted; and as I declared mans hatred to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14151:105"/>
God by the effects of it, ſo the ſame courſe is more fit here, and more neceſſary, becauſe there is no ſuch affection to be conceived in God, but in relation to thoſe effects, which he produceth like unto thoſe creatures which are, and when they are ſo affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeake firſt of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nature and kindes of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, as man ſuſtaines for his ſinnes; <hi>Puniſhment is nothing elſe but ſome evill infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, for ſome fault committed;</hi> and therefore includes two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the ſufferance of ſome evill, and this is as it were the materiall of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the reference to ſome fault precedent, and this is the formal as it were; which makes it properly puniſhment, which otherwiſe would break <hi>malum naturae:</hi> as ſuppoſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:14151:106"/>
had beene, blind or ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his tranſgreſſion, that blindneſſe would have beene evill to him indeed, but onely <hi>malum naturae,</hi> but becauſe it was not inflicted by juſtice for ſin, it would not have beene <hi>malum Poenae,</hi> a Puniſhment: for Iuſtice ſheweth its diſlike to ſinne two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, before ſinne commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by prohibition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, after ſin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by puniſhment: I might perhaps adde another clauſe, and ſay, there muſt be a third condition to make an evill, a puniſhment, that it be inflicted with a mind of puniſhment, and ſo maketwo kinds, or two ſignifications of puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Proper, where all thoſe three conditions are found.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Improper, where the laſt is wanting: the evils that God brings upon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, are properly Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:14151:106"/>
becauſe they are evils, and they flow from Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt ſinne, and that with a purpoſe of puniſhing that ſinne, the <hi>evils that Gods children ſuffer,</hi> are <hi>improperly puniſhments,</hi> but properly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, becauſe though they be evill, and laid upon them for their ſinne, yet they are not ſo much <hi>animo puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endi,</hi> as <hi>animo corrigendi,</hi> not as from a Iudge, but as from a Father, not to revenge, but to reforme them: or rather they may be diſtinguiſhed, not from the perſons upon whom they are inflicted, but from themſelves: for Puniſhments may be conſidered, either as <hi>intermedia</hi> or as <hi>ultima:</hi> the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedia, &amp;c.</hi> Chaſtiſements of their owne nature, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the amendment, both of the wicked and godly, upon whomſoever they fall: but <hi>Supplicium ultimum,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14151:107"/>
it cannot be conceived as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall at all, but as <hi>Poenall</hi> onely that is properly and ſimply Puniſhment: ſo in Commonwealths, all other Puniſhments inflicted upon the delinquent party, are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall, for the recovering of them to honeſt life, according to the lawes, but the laſt of Death, which is the laſt that the Magiſtrates power can extend it ſelfe unto, is onely <hi>Poenall,</hi> and cannot be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as intended in love, for amendment of the malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours.</p>
                  <p>But this ſhall ſuffice to have pointed out the nature of a Puniſhment, now to conceive diſtinctly of the kindes of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments in generall, which God in his juſt wrath, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt ſin, inflicts upon ſinners: I thinke you muſt take the whole extent of the materiall of them, namely
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14151:107"/>
                     <hi>Evill:</hi> for man having offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt Gods juſtice, which is infinit, cannot be ſatisfied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe all evill be brought upon the ſinner, which he is capable of: for in civill Courts of Iuſtice, indeed a puniſhment in the ſame kind that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was, at leaſt in one kind of evill, will make ſufficient ſatisfaction: but where the offence is againſt God, it is not ſo: for though it be <hi>exparte principii,</hi> but one fault, yet it hath <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite guilt.</p>
                  <p>Nay, Secondly though it be <hi>ex parte principii,</hi> but one <hi>formaliter</hi> in that ſelfe, yet even in that reſpect alſo it is all <hi>virtualiter,</hi> in the ſeede, in ſo much as the offender in that once offended againſt God the Authour of the Law, and ſo againſt the whole Law, according to that in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Iames 2. 10. Whoſoever
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14151:108"/>
ſhall keepe the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </p>
                  <p>And thirdly, though it be but one actually, yet it is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively</hi> by all, becauſe the ſame party hath a mind and will to commit all, if there were the like occaſion, now as <hi>God accepteth the will for the deed,</hi> when: there is a willing minde, ſo he imputeth; And though we doe not ſay that God will <hi>de facto</hi> puniſh the wicked for all the ſinnes that they would have committed (as ſome fondly would have infants predeſtinated either to life eternall for the good, or to condemnation, for the evill which he foreſaw they would have done, had he lent them longer life) becauſe then all ſhould have equall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereas there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14151:108"/>
and that no doubt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degrees of their actuall ſinnes. Yet it is no errour to ſay, that God may <hi>de jure,</hi> puniſh any one ſinne with all kindes, and all degrees of puniſhment, not for ſinnes they would have committed, to ſpeake properly, but for that one which deſerves all in ſtrict rigour of Iuſtice, as well as if all were indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and that for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe that containes all in it, and is as much as all in the minde of the ſinner that committed it, though he were hindered, that they did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally breake forth: and as this is true of all ſinne, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of originall, which is all: ſo that to make the fault and the puniſhment equall, wee muſt divide puniſhment by the evill, and make it all evill that a man is capable of.</p>
                  <p>The whole laitude of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:14151:109"/>
then you ſhall take by a threefold diſtinction:</p>
                  <p>The firſt is this, the firſt evill is either <hi>Damni</hi> or <hi>Senſus,</hi> as they uſe to diſtinguiſh puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: either a loſſe and priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of good, or a poſition and feeling of ſome evill, privative or poſitive: for this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction muſt not be reſtrained to eternall puniſhments, as the Schoole ſeemes to doe, but is generall to all, as you eaſily doe and ſhall perceive: and this diſtinction is taken from the adjuncts or affections of evill, or at leaſt we will take it ſo without ſcrupulous inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for the preſent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſecond is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the cauſes or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grall parts: and ſo evill is loathſome in effects, that death, as it is generally uſed in Scripture, and by name, in that of <hi>Geneſis</hi> the intermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, 2. 17. <hi>In the ſame
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:14151:109"/>
day that thou eateſt therereof,</hi> that is, of the forbidden tree, <hi>thou ſhalt die ſurely:</hi> where accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaning of God, there is a <hi>Synec doche</hi> of one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent kind of puniſhment for all the reſt; and if the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the word be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all the particulars there under comprehended, there muſt needs be a metaphor in regard of ſome: for both the ſeparation of the ſoule from God is ſo called Death by the trope, and eternall death hath the ſame reaſon: now to lay out the parts in ſome order: as if divided the good of man, in the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Happineſſe; and it was either <hi>Summum,</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God: or ſecondly, <hi>Subordinatum,</hi> and that againe two fold; firſt, <hi>Internum,</hi> with the eſſence of man, as it were; or ſecondly, <hi>Externum,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him. <hi>Internum</hi> againe
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:14151:110"/>
two-fold, firſt, in the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſecondly, in the Will: firſt, in the <hi>Soule,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the <hi>Body.</hi> In the <hi>Soule</hi> againe two-fold, ſo it is contrary here, which you may reduce to theſe five.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the diſpleaſure of God, and enmity with him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, darkeneſſe of the Vnderſtanding, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, perverſneſſe and crookedneſſe of the Will.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Diſtemper and diſeaſes of the body.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Croſſes in the outward eſtate, want, and ſhame, and all the reſt: And let no man looke backe to the ſcope of this Diſcourſe, which was to ſhew how God ſhewes his enmitie to ſinners, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to ſin, in bringing thoſe puniſhments upon them for it, and than looke upon this
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:14151:110"/>
Catalogue and wonder, to ſee both mans ſinne which is in the third, the untowardneſſe of the will, and Gods wrath, which is the firſt of them: to be brought as puniſhments: for there is a double conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of theſe two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the riſe of them, and then the order of them is thus. <hi>Mans ſinne is the firſt which provokes Gods diſpleaſure,</hi> which brings all other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and then it is thus: <hi>God being provoked, juſtly ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers man to continue and goe on in his ſinnes,</hi> which continually addes fewell to the fire of Gods wrath, and that being the principall linke drawes the chaine of all plagues along with it: So that you ſee in this reſpect, both the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of ſinne, and of Gods wrath, ariſeth from
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:14151:111"/>
Gods wrath provoked by the firſt ſinne, and ſo are mutuall cauſes one to the other: and this is the ſecond diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the third is from the effects, and containes the <hi>Species of puniſhment,</hi> which are two; firſt <hi>Temporall</hi> in this life; ſecondly, <hi>Eternall</hi> in the life to come: and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall differences betweene theſe two are three-fold:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in regard of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of them for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments that God inflicts here, are not in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that they may be, but in a more remiſſe, mingled with the fruition of many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the <hi>Extenſion:</hi> for all puniſhments that make up our full miſery are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, no not upon the wicked here, but in the life to come they are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:14151:111"/>
Thirdly, <hi>In duration:</hi> for puniſhments ſuffered here by the wicked, are neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued without intermiſſion, but have many <hi>Lucida inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valla,</hi> nor continuall without end, but are all concluded in death, which brings a change of this eſtate: but the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the life to come, are to indure without eaſe or end. And the reaſon is, becauſe this life is the time of <hi>Gods patience</hi> and <hi>long ſufferance,</hi> and <hi>gentleneſſe towards ſinners;</hi> wherein he doth either win them by his bleſſings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, or leaves them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, by reaſon of his bleſſings abuſed, and ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt both the inability of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to helpe it ſelfe out of its miſery, which it is fallen into by ſinne, and the equitie of his judgements which are ſo ſweetly tempered with many mercies, before they are
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:14151:112"/>
excluded, and therfore all Gods dealing towards men here is medicinall, though in it owne nature it prove mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, through the corruption of the wicked: but the other is <hi>ſupplicium ultimum, &amp;c.</hi> And thoſe are the three diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Evill or Puniſhment: where the firſt muſt be in the ſecond; and the affections in the parts; and both firſt and ſecond in the third, as in the kindes. For example, in the diſtribution into integrall parts.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was the <hi>Diſplicere and wrath of God:</hi> where you muſt underſtand a double pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, both <hi>Poena damni, the loſſe of Gods favour,</hi> and <hi>Poena ſenſus, the feeling of his diſpleaſure,</hi> and ſo for all the reſt; there is both the <hi>priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome good</hi> conferring to our happineſſe, and the <hi>Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome evill</hi> conſpiring
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14151:112"/>
to our miſery.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe in the third Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution, which was into Species or <hi>kindes,</hi> but in the firſt of <hi>Temporall,</hi> you muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply all the particulars of the ſecond ranke by the parts of puniſhment (of which I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them as principall) and that both <hi>privately,</hi> and <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> according to the firſt: and in the ſecond <hi>eternall,</hi> you muſt doe the like, onely adding thoſe differences, which I mentioned before to their kindes.</p>
                  <p>And now if I ſhould goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to rehearſe the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, it would fill a large Volume which would be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Without and within, lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and mourning and woe:</hi> like that which the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw, 2. 10. If I ſhould muſter them all together, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their ſeverall Colours and Enſignes they would make a

Secondly, Againe, what a miſery to be ſtrucke with ſuch <hi>blindndſſe,</hi> that we cannot finde the way to heaven, no more than the <hi>Sodomties</hi> that groped for, but could not finde <hi>Lots</hi> doore where the Angels went in, no, nor ſee the plaineſt truths that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne that way, not the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall and Elementary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, no more than blind <hi>Sampſon</hi> could ſee the <hi>pilla's of the houſe,</hi> but was faine to have a guide to leade him to them: but live in more than <hi>Egyptian darkeneſſe,</hi> and are given over to moſt groſſe errors by the juſt wrath of God againſt ſinne, as it was, and is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations at this day, and in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in 2 <hi>Theſ. 2. 9. whoſe comming is after the working of Satan, with all power and ſignes, and lying wonders, and with all deceive ableneſſe of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What a depth of miſery is it, that man ſhould degenerate below the bruite beaſts in brutiſhneſſe, which notwithſtanding is a juſt effect of Gods wrath for ſinne, as it may appeare out of the firſt to the <hi>Romans, 21. Becauſe that when they knew not God, they glorifyed him not as God, neither were thankefull, but became vaine in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkened, &amp;c.

But which of you can think upon it, and weigh thoſe words inſerted, <hi>for Ever,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horror and aſtoniſhment? And now perhaps if you could but repeate thoſe words ſometimes with your ſelves, <hi>tormented for ever,</hi> and ſo often as you were about to be angry with God, to ſinne againſt him, as he counſelled <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> to repeate the Alphabet when he was angry, if you could rehearſe that <hi>for ever,</hi> you would take heed how you ever ſinned. <hi>Dives</hi> thought his brethren would beleeve, if ſome were ſent from hell to tell them the torments of the place, and to take heede that they neere come there: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve ye Moſes, and the Prophets, beleeve the Law, and threatnings of God:</hi> Beleeve an humbled Chriſtian, for he comes from hell ſcorched with the flames of Gods wrath: and beleeve

me that theſe argue Gods ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt ſinne, his enmity to ſinners.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of the firſt things I propounded in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, to illuſtrate the wrath of God againſt ſinne, from the nature and ſeverall kindes of puniſhment which a ſinner doth incurre.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſecond thing was (as you may remember) the conſideration of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, let the firſt be of the Angels.</p>
                  <p>The Angels, for one ſinne as moſt thinke, and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, <hi>The Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their owne habitation, he hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in everlaſting chaines under darkeneſſe, unto the judgement of the great day, Iude</hi> 6. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of their nature, which bare that Image of God with the neareſt reſemblance, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:14151:117"/>
are therefore called the <hi>Sonnes of God</hi> in a ſingular manner: their multitude, the good that might have come from their preſervation, their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and prayſing of God; the evill which was like to follow upon the contrary, the fall of man, their eternall blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could not move God to compaſſion: but if Angels ſinne, even Angels ſhall ſmart for it: And now as it is <hi>Iob 4. 18. Behold he put no truſt in his ſervants, and his Angels he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with folly: How much leſſe on them which dwell in houſes of clay, whoſe foundation is in the duſt: which are cruſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the mouth;</hi> that you may learne from hence how great the hatred of God is to ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for I muſt but name thoſe things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine: Looke upon the firſt ſin of man, our forefather: w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> though ſome ignorantly
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:14151:118"/>
have thought it ſo ſmall that they called in queſtion God juſtice in puniſhing it, and the proud Pope blaſphemouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded, that if God were ſo angry for an Apple then he might be juſtly much more for a Peacocke, which he miſſed at his table, yet how hath God ſhewed his deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne in that; in that for it man was deprived of that glorious Image of God, in which he was created, and caſt out of Paradiſe, contracting alſo that guilt of eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and lying under the curſe of God, the ſlavery of ſinne, the tyranny of the devill, and not himſelfe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with his 100000. of ſoules that were in his loynes, even all his poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a third may be the Univerſall deluge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God, the God of mercy, without mercy or compaſſion
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:14151:118"/>
to man, of what condition or ſexe, or age ſoever; to beaſts, to plants, to any creature, the workemanſhip of his owne hands, ſwept away all, and defaced the beauty of the world, reducing all to the firſt Chaos. <hi>When the Earth was without forme and void, and darkeneſſe was upon the face of the deepe,</hi> rather then not to revenge himſelfe upon his enemies, the ſinfull men of thoſe times: As though he had blotted that out of his titles which he ſaith of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Exod. 34. 6. The Lord, the Lord God, mercifull and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, long ſuffering, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in goodneſſe and truth, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping mercy for thouſands, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving iniquities, and tranſgreſſion, and ſinne:</hi> And now tooke up that Emperours Motto, <hi>Fiat Iuſtitia &amp; pereat mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Fourth, may be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14151:119"/>
of <hi>Sodom and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rha</hi> with fire and brimſtone from heaven, which before are ſaid to have beene like the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> the Paradiſe of God, and perhappes the fruits like the tree of Life: but now is famous for the dead ſea, which will admit of no living thing, and the fruit of <hi>Sodom,</hi> or apples are ſaid to be nothing but duſt or aſhes: and of theſe, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> reaſons, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 4. If God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them downe into hell, and delivered them into the chaines of darkeneſſe to be reſerved unto judgement: and ſpared not the old world but ſaved Noah, the eight perſon the Preacher of righteouſneſſe, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and turning the cities of Sodome and Gomorrha into aſhes, condemned them with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, making them an enſample
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:14151:119"/>
unto thoſe that after ſhould live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi> Then as he inferres, <hi>The Lord knoweth how to reſerve the unjuſt unto the day of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be puniſhed:</hi> Then ſay I, you ſee how God ſheweth himſelfe an enemy to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
                  <p>I might tell you of the ſtrange plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and above all, the lamentable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and diſperſion of Gods owne peculiar people; the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and their calamities which they have undergone, the ten Tribes for more then two thouſand yeares, the two for almoſt 1600. ſo great, as one of their owne Rabbins concludes from thence, that their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> muſt needs be come, and they muſt needs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo much for killing him, and ſo alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom. 11. 22. Behold the ſeverity of God in their fall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I might adde ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:14151:120"/>
of the <hi>laſt conflagration of the world,</hi> when by reaſon of the filthineſſe of this latter age of the world, it ſhall be ſo, that it cannot be waſhed with water as the old world was, God ſhall waſte it with fire: <hi>When the heavens ſhall paſſe away with a great noyſe, and the elements ſhall melt with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heate, the earth alſo, and the workes that are therein ſhall be burnt up, 2 Pet.</hi> 3. 10. but I will paſſe to the third, and but name that neither.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the third thing then in which we may behold the wrath of God and hatred againſt ſinne, is one ſingular example, which have both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone and overcome all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments due for our ſinnes, namely, <hi>our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> In which if you will conſider three things.</p>

                        <pb n="219" facs="tcp:14151:120"/>
Secondly, what he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, for what.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The two former are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently expreſſed, <hi>Philip. 2. 6. Chriſt Ieſus, who being in the forme of God, thought it not robbery to be equall with God, but made himſelfe of no reputation, and tooke upon him the forme of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſſe of man, and being found in faſhion as a man he humbled himſelfe, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſſe:</hi> Chriſt Ieſus then the Son of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with God was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: And his ſufferings were,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he became in the forme of a ſervant: laying downe the glory which he had from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, with his father, he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred not the wombe of the Virgin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in his whole <hi>life,</hi> he humbled himſelfe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14151:121"/>
obedient.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in his <hi>death,</hi> and that the moſt ſhamefull, and painefull death of the Croſſe: if you will but read the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, and goe along with our Saviour, in every paſſage of his infinite ſufferings, and then conſider ſomething in your mind, which you cannot ſee with your eyes, even the paines of hell, which he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as our beſt Divines thinke, and gather from his bloody ſweat, arguing more then out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuffering, the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the wrath of God, and his exclamation, <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> arguing a kind of ſeparation of God, which makes the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſubſtance of hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though he did not ſuffer them as the damned doe, for in the greateſt Paroxyſme, when he complained, <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me,</hi> even then he called
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14151:121"/>
him <hi>My God, My God:</hi> But thinke withall this is the Son of God that Created the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the earth, that ſuffers this by <hi>vile ſinners,</hi> his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and for <hi>vile ſinners,</hi> his enemies: And then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if here be not a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable demonſtration of Gods hatred againſt ſinne: and that in three reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in that it appeares by this, he will not be <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without ſatisfaction,</hi> ſo great is his anger, for ever then his nature inclined to mercy, yet he would not heare of it till his juſtice were anſwered, and though hee purpoſed in his Counſell to receive ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to grace, yet he will have the whole debt payed: and though it be curiouſly diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether God might not have freely pardoned ſin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch expiation, yet it is ſufficient for us to know that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14151:122"/>
hee did not, nor would not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee requires an <hi>equivalent ranſome, ex rigore juſtitiae:</hi> if not more than juſtice required: for ſuppoſe wee could imagine a terme of eternity in which ſinners ſhould have ſuffered that would bee a full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but the ſuffering of Chriſt the Sonne of God is farre more than that would be, ſo farre as the Creator ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the creature in infinite degrees of excellencies; now becauſe the ſuffering of any creature, or all creatures could not countervaile the wrong done to his Juſtice, rather than that full reſtitution ſhould not be made, he would have it made by him, who could not chuſe but pay it with overplus, if he did it at all, by reaſon of his infinite dignity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:14151:122"/>
Againe, if all the world had beene redeemed by the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Chriſt, whereas the greateſt part is not, hee neede not have ſuffered more than he did, but that would have beene enough, <hi>ex rigore juſtitiae,</hi> nay, for all the devills too, if there were not another defect of a condition, rather propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in that nature that ſuffered (he not taking upon him the nature of Angels) then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of the ſufferings themſelves, nay, for another world too if there were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world imagined, it would be ſufficient for that too: ſo that God rather than hee would depart one jot from his juſtice, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelfe to the full, in taking a full diſcharge for all our debts, if not more, as hath beene ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, rather than that ſhould faile, he tooke it not of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:14151:123"/>
the <hi>debters</hi> but of the <hi>ſureties,</hi> and that though hee were in ſo neere relation to him, <hi>His onely begotten and beloved ſonne in whom he is well pleaſed,</hi> and ſo as God ſaid to <hi>Abraham. Now I know that thou loveſt me, in that thou haſt not ſpared thins onely ſonne Iſaac:</hi> ſo wee may ſay to God, not onely <hi>now wee know,</hi> O Lord, that thou <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt us,</hi> ſince thou haſt not ſpared thine onely ſonne <hi>Jeſus;</hi> but alſo, <hi>Now we know that thou hateſt ſinne,</hi> ſeeing thou haſt not ſpared thine onely ſonne, but haſt given him to die, rather than that ſhould goe unpuniſhed, unpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the utmoſt farthing.</p>
                  <p>It remaines now onely that we come to make ſome uſe of that which hath beene deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and ſo conclude the firſt Point: but as I have done in the reſt hitherto, ſo I ſhall here alſo propound many things
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:14151:123"/>
briefely, rather than preſſe any thing, and proſecute it fully: one generall uſe I purpoſe to commend unto you,</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Inſtruction;</hi> Wee may from hence take notice of <hi>the miſerable condition of every natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man:</hi> And this is not the leaſt part thereof, that we are not ſenſible of it: it is Satans courſe to deale with his captives, as the Philiſtins dealt with <hi>Sampſon</hi> tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, firſt, <hi>to put out their eyes;</hi> and all ſinners are poſſeſſed with a ſpirituall kinde of drunkenneſſe which makes them ſee no danger when they are in moſt, as <hi>Salomon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the corporall, <hi>Prov. 23. 34. Thou ſhalt be as he that lieth downe in the midſt of the ſea, or as be that lieth downe upon the toppe of the maſt:</hi> they have ſtriken me, ſhalt thou ſay, and I was not ſicke: they have beaten me, and I felt it not: and ſo
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:14151:124"/>
it will not be amiſſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the enemies of God with an alarum from heaven, to cauſe an heavenly light to ſhine round about them, as it befell <hi>Saul</hi> in his furious march to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and I know not how it may be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter done than by collecting the beames of thoſe truths divine that ye have had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (as they doe the Sunne in a burning glaſſe) and caſting them in their faces: for they, I thinke will effectually diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the deſperate miſery they are in; for <hi>miſery</hi> being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to <hi>happineſſe,</hi> as that is a ſtate of <hi>Good,</hi> ſo it is of <hi>Evill,</hi> and evill being of two ſorts, <hi>Evill of ſinne and puniſhment,</hi> it appeares by that which hath beene ſaid, That a naturall man is deepe plunged in both theſe.</p>
                  <p>In ſinne by the firſt point, where it was ſhewed, That
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:14151:124"/>
man is an enemy to God and hates him: in puniſhment, where you heard, That God is an enemy to man and hates him: now can there be any greater height of ſinne, than that man ſhould become an enemy to God? Or any greater weight of puniſhment, than that God ſhould be an enemy to man? Or can there be any greater depth of miſery, than both theſe joyned? For though ſome may thinke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes according to the ſtrict acceptions of miſery that it is onely in penall evill, and includes not ſinne; yet there muſt be a concurrence of both: for</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is impoſſible that there ſhould be any <hi>miſery</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly where there is not <hi>ſinne:</hi> nay, it is ſinne that makes the thing which is but a naturall evill in it ſelfe to be a mortall evill to the ſinner.</p>

                  <p>There is none of us but would defie any that ſhould ſay that we are Gods enemies, to be haters of him: and would account him a moſt profligate and forlorne wretch that ſhould profeſſe himſelfe to be ſo: even that little ſparke of conſcience left in corrupt nature ſhines in the midſt of darkeneſſe, and diſcovers ſo much, that that muſt needs be a miſerable eſtate to be ſo farre forſaken? and would not every one be ready to ſay to the Preacher that tells him ſuch a thing, as <hi>Hazael</hi> told to the Prophet that foretold
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:14151:125"/>
him of his cruelty, <hi>Am I a dogge that I ſhould doe this thing?</hi> But you have heard that every naturall man is an enemy to God many wayes, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to doe him all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe he can in diſpleaſing him, in diſobeying, in diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring, and as much as lies in him in dethroning him: and ſetting up another in his place, even the <hi>world, the luſts of his owne fleſh, the devill, the</hi> baſeſt things, the moſt bitter enemies of God that are: and imployes their mind and ſoule and ſtrength to advance their kingdome; bring that curſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe home to themſelves, and make much of it: but to lay out unto you the vileneſſe of the naturall man in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect; conſider ſome ſew cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in it more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and to omit that filthineſſe with which itdefiles the nature of man, and many other, I will

name but two: firſt, the <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality:</hi> there is ſcarce any ſo bad almoſt, but hee miſlikes ſome that are given to other vices than himſelfe or more, and thinkes himſelfe ſome body in that he is not ſo bad as he: but if there were one that were infected with all vices, in the higheſt degree, how would they which are bad enough themſelves, deplore his caſe as lamentable, and bleſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves an hundreth times that they are not ſo: and I pray tell me what ſin is there which is not included in this to be an enemy to God? What would ſuch an one ſticke to commit? But I paſſe from this.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The iniquity:</hi> for</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is no <hi>reaſon</hi> for this <hi>hatred of God:</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, 2 <hi>Cor. 7. 2. Receive us, we have wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged no man,</hi> we have corrupted no man, <hi>wee have defrauded no

man:</hi> might not the Lord challenge entertainement in our hearts and beſt affections by the ſame reaſon? nay, doth he not expoſtulate the matter with the <hi>Iſraelites, Iere.</hi> 2. 5. to this purpoſe, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, what iniquitie have your fathers found in me, that they are gone farre from me, and have walked after vanity, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vaine:</hi> if the Lord ſhould make uſe of his Prerogative, yet ſhall the clay ſay to the Potter, what doſt thou? yet he never doth ſo. But it were well if this were all: but</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is <hi>great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the contrary</hi> why wee ſhould love God, and you may conceive that; eſpecially three-fold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for that <hi>excellencie that is in God:</hi> how doth <hi>beauty</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the <hi>amorous,</hi> and <hi>gold</hi> the <hi>covetous,</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> the <hi>ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> every thing that hath but
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:14151:127"/>
any luſter of good in it, breeds in us a luſt to have it; the leaſt appearance of it, is a loadſtone of our affections, and is attractive: and how comes it to paſſe that the Ocean of goodneſſe and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that is in God doth not draw us to him? nay, rather drives us from him; for then this to ſay truth is the height of our miſery, that we are ſofar from <hi>loving God,</hi> that wee <hi>loath him</hi> for <hi>his goodneſſe:</hi> this is the ground of the quarrell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us, as I ſhewed in handling the Point before: and who doth not deteſt in his heart ſuch a perverſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and hold it accurſed? but this is not all yet, for</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is not onely <hi>good in himſelfe,</hi> for if he were ſo, and withall, averſe from us, and cruell to us, there were ſiſtence of love (though even in this caſe wee ſhould
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:14151:127"/>
ſay with <hi>Iob, though he kill mee, yet will I truſt in him, yet will I love him)</hi> but it is not ſo, for God is alſo good to us; and may ſay too, as our Saviour once to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> many good workes have I done among you, and for which of them doe you ſtone me? I have created you of nothing, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and partly worſe almoſt than nothing, the duſt of the earth, and that according to mine owne Image. I ſuſtaine and ſupport you, <hi>In me you live, and move, and have your being;</hi> I have made you Lords of the creatures, all doe ſervice to you, even my glorious <hi>Angels have I made miniſtring ſpirits for your good,</hi> not a day paſſes in which you receive not from me, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand remembrances of Love, a thouſand love tokens, both poſitive and primitive graces, proviſion of good, and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14151:128"/>
from evill; I have ſent my beloved Sonne out of my boſome to die for you, ſo did I love the world, and when you had caſt me off, how often have I offered conditions of peace, and how often would I have gathered you as an hen gathereth her young under her wings, and ye would not. Would ye have any more yet, Behold I, even I beſeech you, I have made heaven and earth, that touch the Mountaines and they ſmoke, the Earth and it trembles, I beſeech you by my Miniſters to be reconciled. All this have I done and much more, if you were not your owne enemies in being my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, O ye Sonnes of men: and <hi>for which of my good workes doe you ſtone me,</hi> for which of them doe you hate me, O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull Children! <hi>Is this your kindneſſe to your friend?</hi> to your benefactor? to your Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor?
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14151:128"/>
                     <hi>Heare O Heaven, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken O Earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken, I have nouriſhed and brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt me: The Oxe knoweth his Owner, and the Aſſe his Maſters crib, but Iſrael doth not know, my people doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider: Iſai.</hi> 1. 2. Perhaps that which hath been ſaid, will make you to ſee ſomething in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the miſery of a mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eſtate, and like it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the worſe: For who is moſt ready to condemne an ungratefull wretch, and they are ſuch in ſuch meaſure as you ſee: but this is not all nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God beſide his eſſentiall goodneſſe, and his actuall graciouſneſſe to us, may allure us to love, or at leaſt ſcare us from hatred, by his infinite greatneſſe and Power; <hi>Who would not feare thee O Lord? Rev.</hi> 15. 4. And
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:14151:129"/>
ſo who ſhall not love thee O Lord and glorifie thy name? if not for piety, yet at leaſt for policy; Who doth not pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thoſe ſimple nations, that when it thunders, gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and ſhoote their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes to heaven, as who would ſay, to warre and fight with God? who doth not pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thoſe men that runne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt ſtone walls, and the like, as thinking to beare downe all before them? As <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> his companions told him, when he would needes provoke <hi>Polydimus</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> may not we ſay ſo to them much more that will needes provoke the Lord of hoſtes? if that be true any where, I am ſure it is here: <hi>dulce bellum inexpertis:</hi> let them that know not the weight of Gods hand, vant of their owne ſtrength, and deſire him for their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:14151:129"/>
but let them know the Charots of God are twenty thouſand, &amp;c. which he will bring forth againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſee their owne nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſend Ambaſſadors before and deſire peace: <hi>If God be with me, as David</hi> once ſaid, <hi>I will not be afraid for ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand that ſhall campe round about me:</hi> but if God be the enemy, all the armies in the world cannot ſecure me. Therefore this argues the deſperate mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and madneſſe of a naturall man, that will wage warre with God: this might be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully inlarged, and that not onely from his power, to love us, but to do good unto us alſo</p>
                  <p>I might uſe this as a paſſage to the ſecond conſideration, but I ſhall omit that, becauſe the vileneſſe of our condition, doth appeare ſufficiently out of this, that we are enemies unto God, in our ſinnes by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14151:130"/>
though our hearts abhor almoſt to thinke that any ſhould be ſuch, it is ſo fowle; and it appeares the more, if we adde that this enmity to God includes in it an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall pollution of Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that hates God, will not ſticke to doe any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: yea the more, if we conſider that this enmity is moſt unjuſt, upon no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is extreamely bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, yea it is againſt many reaſons, as the incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excellency, and beauty, and goodneſſe of Gods nature, the unſpeakeable multitude and value of his graciouſneſſe and bleſſings, the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible omnipotency of his power, in rewarding or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, and in all which we cannot chooſe but give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt our ſelves, for the horrible baſeneſſe and vileneſſe of our nature.</p>
