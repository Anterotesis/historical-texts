            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Henry Archer,</hi>
late of <hi>Thaydon Garnon</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who was
well verſed in the French language But
his death diſappoynted me of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
made my pen fall out of my hand,
lye ſtill and ſtirre no further, hauing then
more then halfe finiſhed the Booke. The
ſecond yeare after whoſe death, well
weighing with my ſelfe, that it was a
Worke might yeeld ſome profit to my
Countrie men of <hi>England,</hi> I tooke vp my
Pen againe, and at ſtarts and tymes fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
it. And then withall conſidering
with my ſelfe that a good Booke in theſe
dayes had need of a good man to Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
it, I called to mind that your worthy
ſelfe hauing beene in <hi>Fraunce</hi> and other

ſupport my weake labours therein, and
ſo boldly adventured to Dedicate the

you would not refuſe it, at leaſt for

And further, I hope that it will
not be accompted preſumption to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
a good Booke to the learned and
vertuous. Howſoeuer, it is my dutie to
craue pardon for preſuming to dedicate it
to your worſhip; my ſelfe being a man

            <head>¶To the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> AM loath to woce thee,
by ſtyling thee courteous,
kinde, gentle Reader,
but rather deſire, that the
ſubiect matter of the
Booke might allure thee
to read it. The French
Author thereof, hath intituled it, <hi>TheWiſe Old
Man:</hi> by which title, hee ſeemes to implie, that all
are not wiſe that are old, which if it be ſo, hee then
ſeemes to glance at our Engliſh Prouerb: <hi>No foole
to the old foole.</hi> Howſoeuer hee leſſons both
young and old what they ſhould be. As for my part,
I thinke it not fitting to preface the wholeſome docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and inſtructions contained in it, which as good
Viandes are offered to thy taste, least I ſhould take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
thine appetite to read it, and make thee to ſurfeit
<pb facs="tcp:3512:6"/>
before thou hast fed. All that I haue to doe, and leſſe
I cannot doe, is to craue thy fauourable conſtruction
of that I haue done. For I modestly confeſſe, I haue
beene too ouerweening and bold, to take vpon me to
tranſlate ſo worthy a Worke, of the worthy French
Author thereof, <hi>Monſieur Symon Goulart,</hi>
my ſelfe being no higher a graduate in learning, then
a common Grammarian, and no better skilled in the
French language, then what mine owne practiſe and
ſtudy hath enhabled mee to be. But vpon the firſt
reading of him, I was ſo delighted, that my fingers
did euen itch to ſet pen to paper, and to vnclaſpe ſo
good a Worke, which was ſhut vp from thy vſe and
benefit vnder a ſtrange tongue. Make much I pray
thee of him now, becauſe hee ſpeakes to thee in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
and if he ſpeake it not well, I craue thy pardon,
for I am in fault, that haue taken vpon mee, to make
him ſpeake our language, before I well vnderstand
his. Yet I hope I haue hit of his meaning, though I
vary from his wordes, as all Tranſlators must doe.
And now I am a ſuiter for pardon, I doe wooe thee
by theſe Epithites of courteous, kinde, gentle Reader,
charitably to cenſure mee, for taking vpon me, to put
into Engliſh ſo worthy a Worke, with ſo weake a
hand: which fauour I hope I ſhall the rather obtaine
at thy hands, for that I haue done it, out of a good
<pb facs="tcp:3512:6"/>
will to thee, and not out of any skill in mee, which I
doe diſclaime, and therefore I deſire to hide mee from
thee, and not otherwiſe to be knowne vnto thee, then
I am to the worthy Gentleman, to whom I haue
beene hold to commend the patronage of this Worke.
And ſo I leaue thee (courteous Reader) to God,
and wiſh thee to be with God, when
thy time is to goe to him, and will
ſtill bee thy well wiſher in
all good things.</p>

and requirable in the ancienter ſort of perſons
in euery thing they doe, ſo long as they ſoiourne and
make their abode here on earth. It is a thing very vſuall
and common vnto vs all our life long, which is but
ſhort, to caſt &amp; imagine continually with our ſelues, the

There is nothing ſomuch doth trouble vs, and makes
old age terrible vnto vs, as the feare to depart hence,
and to leaue this withering and tranſitory life, whereof
old age is the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> and laſt concluding act, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an end of vs ſpeedily, and may be called the ſunne
ſet of our dayes. Conſider the ancienter ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and you ſhall obſerue almoſt no one humour ſo
much predominant and raigning in them, as a feruent
deſire to auoide all ſurfeitings and exceſſe, and to keepe
a good diet, to the end to maintaine a little ſtrength,
and to hold our life, be it but for an houre, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
themſelues they may liue one yeare longer at the
leſt. Would you gladly pleaſe or flatter them; doe but
make them younger in yeares then they are, by telling
them they are not ſo old as they reckon and take them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to be, and that there is no cauſe or likelihood but
they may liue many a yeare longer then others, and
forget not in words to extoll their experience, ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
prudence, and wiſedome to contriue and wade
thorough great matters; you are by and by their onely
man, who but you, none more made on.</p>
               <p>It is a point of vndoubted truth that God created <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
and <hi>Eue,</hi> not onely to enioy a life for ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of yeares, but to liue for euer; whereupon there
was fixed and imprinted in their heartt a feruent deſire
to liue; and not to ſee death. For although that maſſe
and lumpe of duſt, whereof the firſt mans body was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
and made, did inueſt him with mortalitie, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the likeneſſe and ſimilitude which hee had with
God, death had neuer ſeized on him, but <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; all his
poſteritie had ſubſiſted and continued long vpon earth,
in a large and pleaſant plot of ground, purpoſely ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for them to dwell in (the whole world, before ſin
entred, being wonderfully beautifull) vntill ſuch time as
he and all his poſteritie, without feeling griefe of minde
or paine of body, had beene by God tranſlated into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
if they had remained in the firſt eſtate wherein they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3512:9"/>
were created. But <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> hauing wilfully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
Sathan to efface and deface the image of God
in them, they both, and all their naturall off-ſpring
long of them, were made ſubiect vnto death, became
ſtrangers to the life of God, and were called <hi>Fleſh;</hi> an
appellation and name very fit for them. Howſoeuer
this bee ſo, yet by the ſpeciall bleſſing of the Father of
heauen, through the meanes and fauour of his beloued
Sonne, who was ordained to be the Sauiour of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
this preſent life (how miſerable ſoeuer it be by
reaſon of ſinne) is no ſmall Donation or pettie Legacy,
but a moſt excellent gift of God vnto his children. I
ſpeake of long life promiſed to them which ſhall beare
and behaue themſelues, as they ought to doe, toward
God and toward their neighbours, as is recorded in the
ſecond and fifth commandement of the morall law,
where the promiſes are ſet downe, whereunto that
which is further added in the end of the 91. Pſalme, is
referred and hath relation; That hee which vnfainedly
loueth the Lord ſhall be ſatisfied with long life. But
this longitude and length of life muſt not cauſe vs to
forget, eſpeciall in all our troubles and trialls,<note place="margin">The benefit of death.</note> that by
death wee haue reſt and caſe from our toylings and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and that this life of ours is a paineful pilgrimage,
a Sea-voyage full of danger and perill,<note place="margin">The miſerable condition of life.</note> a mercileſſe war,
ſparing none, making hauocke of all, deſeruing (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the euills that wee ſuffer and indure in it) to bee
tearmed rather a death then a life. Vpon the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof, a certaine graue ancient Father cried out;
O death, how welcome and pleaſing is thy doome and
ſentence to him that is in want, to the man whoſe
ſtrength faileth him, to him that is waxen very old, and
is afflicted on all ſides, hauing no part of him free from
paine, to the man that is at defiance and out of loue
with himſelfe, and to him that hath caſt off patience and
is growne deſperate! What thing is there that may bee
more deſired, then ſpeedily to ſhake off, and rid vs of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3512:10"/>
theſe chaines, to get out of the priſon, and darke and
fearefull dungeons and deſerts, wherein wee are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
faſt tied and bound; that ſo wee may recouer the
precious libertie to goe to our home, to dwell in the
houſe of the Lord, and in his Palace of glory to triumph
and reioyce? What doth long life bring with it, but a
<hi>Chaos</hi> and infinite number of euills? It hath beene ſaid
many yeares agoe,
<q>
                     <l>This grieuous penalty vpon old men is ſet,</l>
                     <l>All the day long at home to grieue and to fret.</l>
                     <l>With ſorrowes and woes they are compaſt about,</l>
                     <l>Still one paine or other they are neuer without.</l>
                     <l>They conſume and weare old, as they goe mourning in blacke,</l>
                     <l>And ſo at laſt with griefes heauy load, away hence doe packe.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But he that hath liued well, although he die when he
is but twentie yeares old, ought to haue his tombe erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and placed with the oldeſt and wiſeſt, and with great
ioy and applauſe to haue this for his Epitaph.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>I haue liued long enough, and am content here to lye,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe nature is pleas'd I ſhould ſo ſoone dye.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But that man knowes well what it is to liue, whoſe
care is not altogether for himſelfe, but how hee may liue
to pleaſe God, and to benefit and do good to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
in whom Ieſus Chriſt liueth, who hath not ſo
great a care of any one part of his life, as he hath for his
whole man, and for euery part thereof. Verity it is a
ſtrange thing, and not much to be approoued or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
that we are ſo many wayes carefull for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
life, and to pranke vp and mainetaine our ſelues in
this world, and make ſo ſmall account of our better
part, which ſo much concernes vs, to wit, our ſoule,
the welfare and good health thereof. Whereof <hi>Dauid</hi>
ſeemeth to make high account, as is euident in the 34.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3512:10"/>
Pſalme, when he asketh this queſtion, Who is he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
long life, and loueth long dayes to ſee good?
Keepe (ſaith hee) thy tongue from euill, and thy lippes
from lying talke and equiuocation; turne aſide from
that which is euill, and doe the thing that is good, ſeeke
peace and purſue it. And when he ſpeaketh of life, hee
vſeth a word, which according to the <hi>Idiom</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of the language wherein he ſpake, may be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>liues;</hi> to put vs in mind, that we ſhould not reſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and content our ſelues, with that life, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with vs and the Plants and beaſts of the fielde, but
that our thoughts ſhould bee eleuated higher to that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life, which is guided by reaſon, and is indeed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be called life, without which we ſhould bee more
wretched &amp; miſerable then the beaſts. Verily the ſenſual
ſeruile and brutiſh life is nothing worth, and not greatly
to be regarded. What glory can it bee to vs, or how
ſhould wee place our felicity in ſuch a life, wherein the
beaſts &amp; euery Idiot and <hi>Lourdaut</hi> may braue it aſwel as
wee, and haue as great priuiledge and commoditie and
much more. Let vs carefully looke to, and ſet our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
vpon that life, by which our better part, the
ſoule, hauing as it were ſequeſtred and eſtranged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from all transſitory things is lifted vp vnto God,
cleaueth faſt vnto him, and by his Spirit is nouriſhed,
comforted, and fed vnto the hope of eternall life. This
is the life that the Prophet willeth vs to be in loue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and enamoured of, to the poſſeſſion and fruition
whereof, wee are regenerated by the incorruptible ſeed
of his word, who hath aboliſhed death, and by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
brought into the world life and immortalitie. For
the caſe being thus decreed, that all men muſt once die,
and euery one of vs hauing daily before our eyes foure
aſſured witneſſes, that beare record of our mortality,
and that die we muſt; our owne naturall frailty, diuers
accidents and miſchances that may happen to vs, many
ſurfeitings and diſtemperatures, and olde age at laſt;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3512:11"/>
how can we ſufficiently aggrauate and diſplay the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
and vanity of man, who doth not raiſe himſelfe
higher then theſe earthly things, and mindeth, and
thinketh vpon nothing ſo much as vpon this dying life,
or rather a liuing death. That which me heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
and Naturaliſts write of long life, and the
meanes to prolong it, will helpe vs little or nothing at
all, and at no time can aſſure &amp; comfort the conſcience.</p>
               <p>Some of them thinke that men may liue longer in
hote countries then in cold; others are of opinion, that
the Northerne and colder climates are beſt to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
health and long life, and <hi>Galen</hi> is perſwaded that
the ayre of <hi>Aſia Minor</hi> in the Eaſt parts is a more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
countrey to liue in then any other. But theſe
wiſe men doe further obſerue, that beſides a good ayre,
many other things are requiſite, as to keepe a good diet,
to vſe reſt and exerciſe at due houres, to purge ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
and to cuacuate the excrements and groſſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the body, and ſometimes to forbeare it, to
haue the mind merrily diſpoſed and free from pertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations
and paſſions. But admit all theſe helpes ſhould
concurre, which ſeldome happens, what man is ſo
ſimple and vnaduiſed, be he neuer ſo young, to aſſure
himſelfe in the morning when hee riſeth, to liue to goe
to his bed at night? What man is there by keeping a
good diet, and liuing temperately, and by following
the rules and preſcriptions of Phyſicians, is able to
make himſelfe continue and laſt ſo long as a Date or
Cypreſſe tree, or to liue ſo long as a Rauen, a Stagg, or
a baſe creeping worme?</p>
               <p>Many haue compoſed and ſet forth bookes, wherein
they treate how a man may preſerue health, and <hi>Galen</hi>
reporteth of one <hi>Antiochus</hi> a Phyſician, who conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himſelfe to eate ſparingly three times a day, a
piece of bread ſpread with hony, liued in wonderfull
health and ſtrength of body many yeares. <hi>Plinie</hi> in his
22. Booke. Chap. 24. maketh mention of one <hi>Pollio,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:3512:11"/>
who liued more then a hundred yeares, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> how and by what
meanes he preſerued ſo long the good health of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and vigour of minde, made him this anſwere, That
hee vſed to ſupple his ioynts with oyle, and to drinke
the beſt wine hee could get. In his 7. Booke and 50.
Chap. hee propoundeth for an example (thinking the
like not to be found) of one <hi>Xenophilus</hi> a Muſician, who
liued a hundred and fiue yeares, and was neuer in all
that time ſicke, nor felt any ach or paine in his body.
<hi>Cicero</hi> alſo in his Dialogue of old age, maketh mention
of <hi>Arganthonius</hi> King of <hi>Gades,</hi> who raigned foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
yeares, and liued a hundred and twenty. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the time of our life, which is not imployed in well
doing and vertuous actions, is to be accounted loſt, and
that the greateſt part of this preſent life, vaniſheth away
in miſeries, which we are forced to ſee and ſuffer. Good
God, how are they to be lamented, and pittied, that haue
nothing where of they can boaſt, nor whereon to reſt
and place their aſſurance, but vpon a number of yeares,
and who commonly die, when as yet they haue not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
take order to liue, or when they haue no ſooner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to be wiſe, but they are aſſoone dead?</p>
               <p>I pray you doe we call that long, which hath an end,
yea ſuch an end as euery minute wee expect and looke
for? Euery man is deſirous and willing to liue long, and
ſtriueth with might and maine, vſing his vttermoſt
power ſtudie and care to liue long, although the time
he runnes and moylingly trots vp and downe, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer
ſo long, compared to eternitie, is but as a drop of
water to the maine ſea. To bee briefe, long life in this
world is nothing elſe, but a painefull progreſſe, which
makes it ſhorter and ſhorter, and at laſt makes an end of
it. Let euery man then (as <hi>Cicero</hi> counſelleth) hold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
contented with the time is appointed vnto him, by
him, who hath the houre glaſſe of our life in his hand,
who hath ſtinted our dayes how long they ſhall runne,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3512:12"/>
and hath ſet downe this for his will, that they ſhould be
ſhort and miſeerable, which hee hath done to this end,
that we ſhould with good <hi>Abraham</hi> hauing our fill, full
loade and backe burthen of dayes, packe away and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
from this life, not as from a houſe of eaſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
but as from a baſe beggarly Inne, making all the
ſpeed wee can to goe hence, to enjoy that life which is
free from all feare of death, from ſorrow, errour, and
falſe dealing, and is euerlaſting. O how bleſſed are
they to whom God hath vouchſafed to reueale the way
of life, who by and through Ieſus Chriſt haue obtained
the fulneſſe of ioy, and thoſe euerlaſting pleaſures which
are in Gods right hand. For although it be elſewhere
promiſed, that ſuch perſons being planted in the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and family of the Lord, ſhall bring forth fruit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly
in their white old age, ſhall bee in good
caſe, alwayes flouriſhing, that their youth ſhall bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
as the Eagles, yet is to be vnderſtood rather of
their ſpiritual vigour &amp; ſtrength, then of the ſtrength of
the body, in which reſpect Lions, Elephants, &amp; Eagles
doe farre ſurpaſſe vs. Whereupon the ſaying of the
Prophet doth conſent and agree, that thoſe which are
the Lords followers, and doe attend and wait vpon
him, doe renew their ſtrength, their wings doe ſpread
and inlarge as the wings of an Eagle, they runne and ſhal
not be wearied, they trauell and walke vp and downe,
and ſhall not bee tyred nor faint, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40. 31. The
might and power of God doth ſo ſupport and vphold
them, that they ouercome difficulties and hard vſage,
they can paſſe ouer and vndergoe all troubles whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
by the meanes of Ieſus Chriſt, who doth aſſiſt and
ſtrengthen them, and doe at laſt happily end their
dayes. Neuertheleſſe, we grant and acknowledge, that
God doth ſometimes ſet foorth vnto vs notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of hardy old men; who for their ſtrength of body,
and courage of minde may be wondred at. Such a one
was <hi>Moſes,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. 7. that dying
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3512:12"/>
when hee was a hundred and twentie yeares old, his
ſight was not dimme, neither was his ſtrength of body
decayed. <hi>Caleb</hi> alſo, that valient chanpion and faithfull
ſeruant of God, who being foureſcore and fiue yeares
old, ſaid to <hi>Ioſhua</hi> Chap. 14. I am as ſtrong of body as I
was, when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſent mee for a Commander (being
more then fortie yeares ſince) and I am as able to doe
ſeruice in the warres, and to march and trauerſe my
ground as I was then. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> writeth thus to <hi>Paul</hi>
of <hi>Concorda;</hi> Behold this is the hundred yeare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate
of thy life, and yet thy ſight is good thou mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt
ſtoutly, thou art quicke of hearing, thy teeth are
ſound, thou haſt a ſhrill and eloquent voyce, thy body
is ſtrong and luſtly, thy face ruddy and well coloured,
wherat thy white haires ſeeme to enuy, and thy ſtrength
is ſuch that thou art taken to bee younger then thou art,
thy blood which freezeth and is cooled, doth not he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and dull thy ready and quicke wit, nor the wrinkles
of thy forehead make thee looke ſtrene and gaſtly. We
haue ſeen in our time many venerable old men, &amp; there
are to bee found many worthy Diuines, that are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
and tenne, and foureſcore yeares old, whoſe age
hath no whit diminiſhed their ſtrength of minde or
ſharpeneſſe of wit, but that they are ſtill to this day, by
their graue counſells, godly communications, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
writings, very helpefull to their Friends, and doe
good ſeruice to the Church, to their Prince and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
weale, and like <hi>Appius</hi> ſurnamed the blinde, ſee
more apparantly what is good and behoouefull for their
countrey, then thoſe that ſit neere the helme and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of the State. I affirme confidently of them,
that they are trees ſurely rooted and well grounded:
And that thoſe verſes of <hi>Virgill</hi> the Poet are wiſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented,
where he ſaith;
<q>
                     <l>The life of man at the beſt, is as a vaniſhing dreame,</l>

                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:3512:13"/>
And after many diſeaſes, and ſore trauell without reſt,</l>
                     <l>Death comes at laſt, and lockes him vp in a cheſt.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe that curiouſly ſearch into the nature of things,
haue from time to time obſerued, that wee are no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
borne but a certaine heat doth preſerue our naturall
and radicall moyſture, which at laſt, eſpecially in old
age, by extreame cold his contrary is cooled and quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
ſo as man hath not a iot of time left him to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
his vitall powers, or to maintaine the good tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature

before the flood.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the ſaying of an ancient man, that it is a
thing indifferent and not againſt reaſon, for
a right good man to wiſh death, or to deſire
to enjoy the life preſent in this world,
which to ſome is prolonged for their condemnation,
and to others as a ſpeciall fauour of God: ſo as wee bee
alwayes ready according as it ſhall pleaſe God to yeeld
vp our life, or to keepe it ſtill. Life is to bee deſired not
ſo much for it ſelfe, as for that we doe thereby attaine to
the wiſedome and knowledge of many and ſundry
things, eſpecially of things Diuine, for the attainement
whereof, God, who is Almightie and good, beſtowed
vpon the firſt Patriarches the gift of long life. The
times before the vniuerſall flood had herein a great pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge
in regard of the off-ſprings and progeny of
<hi>Seth.</hi> For though they were intangled and cumbred
with many miſeries (as from the name <hi>Henoch</hi> is collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which ſignifies a man of miſery, and from the name
of <hi>Noah,</hi> whoſe father <hi>Lamech</hi> gaue him that name, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hope he had of ſome comfort, after many ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
and afflictions) yet may it be ſaid, that the world
was then in his prime and beſt dayes: At which time
theſe good Patriarches were not booke learned, but all
the knowledge they had in naturall Philoſophy, or in
the courſe of the Starres they got it by long obſeruation
and experience, which from the grandfathers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
were deliuered ouer and taught to their children,
and to their childrens children, as <hi>Ioſephus</hi> witneſſeth in
his firſt booke of Antiquities, and third Chapter. Many
wondering heereat, haue mooued this queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be likely or probable, that the Patriarched liued
ſo long as nine hundred yeares and vpwards, as our firſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3512:14"/>
father <hi>Adam, Methuſula,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> did? Some curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
wits, whoſe maner is to meaſure euery thing by the
meat-wand, and rule of their owne ouerweening pride,
who becauſe they could not perſwade themſelues that
the years of the Patriarches were compoſed of twelue
moneths, or of three hundred threeſcore &amp; fiue dayes,
euery day hauing foure and twenty houres, and euery
houre his ordinary minutes, haue imagined (as Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> reports in his 15. Booke <hi>De ciuitate Dei, chap</hi>
10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.) that the yeares of the firſt world were not
reckoned according to our preſent computation and
ſtyle, but that one of our yeares now, is as much in the
ballance of account, as tenne yeare then, and they held
their opinion for currant and to bee approoued, for
that the people of the old world doe ſtill to this day dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
about the calculation of the yeare. For the <hi>AEgypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
had their yeare of foure moneths, the <hi>Acarnans</hi> of
ſixe, and the <hi>Lauinians</hi> of thirteene moneths. <hi>Plinie</hi> the
ſecond, hauing written that the Hiſtories make menti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
of two, whereof one liued one hundred fiftie and
two yeares, and the other liued two hundred yeares,
and of many that liued till they were eight hundred
yeeres old, addeth, that the ignorance of the times gaue
credit to ſuch tales and reports, becauſe there were of
the antienter men of thoſe times, that did ſhut vp and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe
the yeare within the ſeaeſons thereof, ſome of them
reckoning the yeare by the ſummer ſeaſon, others did
put the ſummer and winter ſeaſon together, and made
two yeares of them both, and ſome of them did reckon
the interuall and ſpace from the change of the Moone,
to the laſt day of the wayne for a whole yeere. But
beſides that the hiſtory of the Deluge, being heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
looked into and examined, according to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
and dayes, doth confute this errour: Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>
declareth, that ſuch coniectures can haue no force
or authoritie in this diſpute, and driueth theſe curious
diſputers into a manifeſt abſurditie. For if ſeuenty yeare's
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3512:14"/>
then, were but ſeuen of our yeares now, <hi>Kenan</hi> when he
was ſeuen yeares old begot his ſonne <hi>Mahalaleel,</hi> and
<hi>Mahalaleel,</hi> being onely fiue yeares old and a halfe,
ſhould haue had <hi>Iered,</hi> as <hi>Henoch</hi> alſo at the ſame age,
ſhould haue begot his ſonne <hi>Methuſula.</hi> But not to
ſtand and relye vpon the vaine diſputes of prophane
people, who being ignorant in the Art of Aſtronomy,
and Celeſtiall motions, haue inuented yeares after their
owne fancy, and haue intricated themſelues in infinite
errours, which time by the helpe and skill of learned
Aſtronomers hath reformed and corrected. Moſt ſure
and certaine it is, that after the Deluge, the whole earth,
by that fearefull puniſhment of the inundation of waters,
failed to yeeld his foiſon and ſtrength as before, and
men being more luxurious and diſſolute of life, liued
not ſo long as they did before, as appeareth by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy
of the ſonnes of <hi>Sem,</hi> in the 11. Chapter of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis.</hi>
Preſently the yeares of the holy Patriarches did
ebb and abate of their number, and in proceſſe of time,
men in their manners grew worſe and worſe, ſo that at
laſt in the time of <hi>Iacob,</hi> the age of man did ſhrinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and decay very much, and afterward much more in
the time of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> whereof wee may haue an inſtance
and proofe in the nintie Pſalme, although the yeares
there mentioned ſeeme to be abriged, and cut off for an
extraordinary rod of correction to them in the Deſert.
<hi>Caius</hi> the lawyer giueth his iudgement, that the houre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe
of mans life (euen of thoſe that are of the ableſt
bodies and mindes) cannot runne much longer then a
hundred yeares. In the bookes of Heathen Authors,
there are found notable and rare examples, and perhaps
fabulous, of men that haue liued very old. The yeares
of <hi>Neſtor</hi> are become a proueeb, by reaſon that <hi>Homer</hi>
gaue it out that he liued thee hundred yeares. The Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedian
Poets broach it for a truth that one <hi>Tireſias</hi> liued
ſixe hundred yeares, and <hi>Plinie</hi> in his 7. Booke Chap.
48. hath ſet downe a Catalogue of old men that liued to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3512:15"/>
a very great age. <hi>Sabellicus</hi> in his <hi>AEneades</hi> reporteth
that in <hi>Arabia,</hi> men liue till they bee foure hundred
yeares full out. Our French Hiſtoriographers doe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
the memory of one <hi>Iohn des temps,</hi> who had an
Eſquires place vnder <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> about the year 800.
and liued vntill the yeare 1124. vnder the Emperour
<hi>Conrad</hi> the third. In our dayes there haue beene found
in the Eaſt and Weſt <hi>Indies</hi> old men, that haue out liued
two hundred yeares, and in diuers parts of <hi>Europe</hi> chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the temperate Clymates, but eſpecially in the
mountaine countries, there be found men aboue a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares old, that are very voluble and fluent in
talke and diſcourſe. But whether this bee ſo or no, all
wiſe men agree in this, that although God, by his ſpeciall
bleſſing, for certaine great reaſons, hath drawne out the
dayes of ſome of his children to a very great length,
and that oftentimes it falleth out that the wicked ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
periſh, and haue their life taken away for their
rebellion againſt him, as the whole race of <hi>Cain</hi> was
ſwallowed vp of the flood, and not a man of them left
aliue: Yet this earth that beares vs vp, and whereupon
we tread, is not the Land of the liuing, as <hi>Baſil</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in his expoſition vpon the 44. Pſal. For here before
the ſoule goes out of the body, we are often and long a
dying, feele many aſſaults of death, who giues vs many a
ſore blowe, &amp; deadly wound before he kil vs out-right:
firſt our infancy dies in vs, next our childhood, afterwards
our youth or age of twentie or one and twentie yeares
growth, conſequently our manly and middle age which
is followed with old age, which changeth both vs, and
our affections, making vs to liue after another manner.
We ſhall then be in the land of the liuing, when wee
ſhall be the ſame men we ſeeme to bee, vnchangeable,
without griefe of minde, or ſickneſſe of body, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to any corruptions, or defilements, nor frowardly
liuing in ſtrife and debate. While we liue in this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
of the body (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4.) Wee
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3512:15"/>
ſigh and mourne, being heauily burthened, not that wee
deſire to be ſtripped or vnclothed, but to be clothed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
that that which is mortall in vs may bee ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp of life. In heauen, which indeed is the land
of the liuing, we ſhall be ſtripped of all that is vile, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
mortall, fraile, and corruptible in vs and ſhall
bee clothed with a robe of glory and bleſſed immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
In which countrey, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in ſome
place ſaith, we ſhall finde true and faithfull dealing, and
from whence all impoſtures, errour, and falſhood is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed;
as there our ioy ſhalbe a true ioy, ſo there our life
alſo ſhall bee a true life. Now although the damned
doeriſe againe, yet to ſpeake properly they ſhall not liue,
for their life ſhall bee in perpetuall torments, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are they ſtil kept aliue, that their tortures ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue end, that their gnawing worme die not, and
that their fire of torment goe not out. That life onely is
to bee accounted a life, which is both euerlaſting and
happy. God hauing no purpoſe therefore, that his
elect children ſhould mewe vp, or confine their felicitie
within the little narrow compaſſe of a brittle and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
life, but ſhould ſeeke out and looke for another
countrey, where they may liue at more libertie and for
euer, hath beene contented to giue them a moſt aſſured
teſtimony thereof, before the law, and before the
flood, in the perſon of the Patriarch <hi>Henoch,</hi> then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the law in the middle age of the world, in the perſon
of his Prophet <hi>Eliah,</hi> and in the laſt age of the world in
the perſon of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Which three perſons are
now gone into heauen: The firſt two as young ſchollers
and diſciples, purpoſely trained vp and choſen to bee
heires of eternall life, that they might bee to all others
worthy witneſſes of euerlaſting happineſſe, and that the
men of their times might euidently ſee and bee aſſured,
by that which fell out in the liues of theſe two great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
(whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Booke of the reſurrection
of the fleſh ſurnameth, The white robed Saints of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3512:16"/>
that there is another land of the liuing, where
wee ſhall one day meete together as well in body
as in ſoule. And as for Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, he
as head of the Church, and as a tryumphing conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
of death and hell, is aſcended into heauen to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
a place in his kingdome, for thoſe that be his &amp; to
draw vnto him at the appointed time, all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of his myſticall body. Then ſhall be fulfilled all the
words of the Prophet, mentioned in the end of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and ſecond Pſalme. Thou haſt afore all times laid
the foundation of the earth, and the heauens are the
worke of thy hands, they ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure;
they ſhall waxe old as a garment: thou ſhalt alter
and change them as a garment, and they ſhall be altered
and changed. But thou art alwayes the ſame, thy yeares
ſhall bee at a ſtay and neuer faile: the children of thy
ſeruants ſhal dwell in thy preſence, and their ſeed ſhall
remaine, and be eſtabliſhed in thy ſight.</p>

his Creator had placed him. Where
ſo long as he would doe that which
God commanded him, hee liued at
pleaſure and hearts eaſe, was in fauour with God, who
created him good, he wanted neither meat nor drinke
conuenient, nor any good thing. The tree of Life was
a ſtrong guard to his perſon, to defend him againſt the

or any outward thing to hurt or annoy him, hee had

there perfect health of body and tranquilitie of minde.
This Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affirmes of him in his 14. Booke,
<hi>De Ciuitate Des, chap.</hi> 16. Let vs adde that which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcene</hi>
writes of him in the eleuenth Chapter of <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxall</hi>
faith, in theſe words; That Gods will and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
being to create man after his owne image, and to
make him the prime Monarch ouer all the world, hee
prepared and built him a moſt ſtately and ſumptuous
Palace, where hee might lead his life in all happineſſe.
And this was the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> a ſtore houſe of all
ſorts of ſpices, and of all things elſe which might giue
him content and delight, a place very temperate, radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and ſhining, with a moſt cleere, wholeſome, pure
and freſh ayre, ſtrewed all ouer with greene hearbes,
and with moſt fragrant and ſweet ſmelling flowers; In
the middeſt was planted the tree of Life, and the tree
of knowledge of good and euill, to no other end but to
prooue and exerciſe his obedience, and that hee might
ſee that Gods will was not, that hee ſhould be diſtracted
with diuers and wandring imaginations, and that his
chiefeſt buſineſſe ſhould bee to prayſe and bleſſe his
Creator, and to make it his ſolace and delight, to ſixe
his thoughts and affections on him. Theſe teſtimonies
of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and <hi>Damaſcene,</hi> doe explaine the
wordes of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> who ſaide that the earthly Paradiſe
(for ſo is the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> commonly called) was
not an allegoricall and imaginary Garden, or ſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
hanging in the ayre, and not really in nature, but
it was the ſight of a goodly countrey, ſurueyed by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
had his bounds and abuttments vpon a certaine
angle of the world towards the Eaſt, where <hi>Eue</hi> was
framed and carued out of the ſide of <hi>Adam,</hi> and where
trees and fruits did naturally growe, and was the foode
by which they did liue: And this Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> was
not the whole continent of the earth, for <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eue</hi> after their fall were baniſhed and driuen out of it,
to goe to ſeeke there dwelling elſewhere. All Diuines
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3512:17"/>
doe affirme, that in the Hiſtory of <hi>Adams</hi> creation, as
things are penned and ſet downe by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> in the
three firſt Chapters of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> there were many myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
contained. But it followes not, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
in his eight Booke vpon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> according to the litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
text, learnedly cleares the point, that in the ſaid Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of <hi>Adams</hi> firſt eſtate, there was nothing conteined
but Allegories, <hi>Idenes,</hi> and things myſticall: As it muſt
not bee inferred vnder the collour and pretext, that the
pillar which followed the people in the Deſert, was
Chriſt; that there was not a materiall and naturall
rocke, out of which guſhed out waters, which did natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
quench the peoples thirſt in the Deſert. If then a
myſticall and typicall ſenſe bee the matter in queſtion,
Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his fourth Volume and Tractat, Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his ſecond Booke vpon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> vrging the
words of the text litterally againſt the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and
<hi>Damaſcene</hi> in the place before alledged, doe alſo ſay
that the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> was a figure of the Paradiſe and
felicity of the Church, in the middeſt whereof was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Chriſt, the true tree and bread of life, out of which
followeth riuers of heauenly and euerlaſting life: As alſo
that it ſignified and made a repreſentation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heauen, and to this latter ſignification our
Lord ſeemes to referre, when to the Theefe vpon the
Croſſe, who repented, acknowledged his Sauiour, and
made ſo excellent a confeſſion of his faith, as no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
can make a better, he ſaid, This day ſhalt thou bee
with me in Paradiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 43.</p>
               <p>Concerning the tree of Life, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his
26. Chapter of the fourth Booke, <hi>De ciuitate Dei,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
antient an moderne Diuines, doe thinke that the
tree of Life, was ſo called, not becauſe the fruite of it
ſuſtained man in life, as other fruits doe, but that (by a
ſpeciall bleſſing) the fruit of it did maintaine <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eue</hi> in life and ſtrength of body, that they were not
troubled with any diſeaſe. They gather their expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3512:17"/>
on from this, that <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall was by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
of God baniſhed with his wife out of the
garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> &amp; to this end that he ſhould not ſtretch
forth his hand to gather and eat of the fruit of this tree,
whereby hee might liue for euer. And from the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins,
which with a wauing and flouriſhing ſharpe edged
ſword, were placed towards the Eaſt part of the garden,
to keepe him from comming that way to the tree of life,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 22. 24. Some Diuines ſaid that after <hi>Adams</hi> reuolt,
the paſſage way to the tree of life was barrocadoed and
ſhut vp, not that God feared that <hi>Adam</hi> after he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
his doome and iudgement to returne to the duſt
of the earth, from whence hee was taken, could by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the fruit of the tree of life recouer immortalitie,
but that he hauing made himſelfe a mortall creature, and
loſt his dignity, ſhould haue his ſcutchion of honour
taken from him and trampled vnder feet, and all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments,
badges, and markes of the fauour of God and
immortality. For otherwiſe, to ſpeake properly, God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is the head ſpring of life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 10. Nay he is our
life and the length of dayes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 20. And not any
tree, nor the fruit of a tree. And wittily doth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
ſcoffe at <hi>Heſiodus,</hi> and his other fellow Poets, who tooke
vpon them to make a materiall bread and drinke for the
liuing gods, which they called <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambroſia.</hi> S.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his eight booke vpon <hi>Geneſis,</hi> ſeemeth out
of the wordes of the text very fitly to reſolue this point
of doctrine, when hee ſaith, that all the fruits of other
trees were giuen to man for the nouriſhment and food
of his body, but the tree of life, and the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of good and euill, were giuen him in the nature
and quality of a Sacrament. Other Diuines, whoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I reiect not, doe hold that the tree of life was a figure
of the Goſpel, and the tree of knowledge of good and
euill, was a figure of the Law; that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> by
eating of the fruit of this latter tree might now come to
know good and bad, vertue and vice, right and wrong,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3512:18"/>
iuſtice or iniuſtice, or by their diſobedience to God in
doing that which he had forbidden them, might learne
to their owne confuſion, from what an excellent ſtate
they were fallen, and into what an abiſſe and bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
gulfe of confuſion they had plunged themſelues.
Many ancient learned men doe write, that the tree of
life did ſignifie wiſedome planted in the middeſt of the
garden, that is ingraffed or infuſed into the heart of man,
which is in the middeſt of his body; And for proofe
hereof, they alledge the place in the third chapter of the
Prouerbes, where it is ſaid, That wiſedome is a tree of
life to thoſe that lay hold of it. We thinke no leſſe, but
that <hi>Salomon</hi> in that ſentence doth allude to the tree of
life in the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> which was to our firſt Parents
a Sacrament of the life which they had receiued of God,
and which had beene perpetuated to them, if they had
not rebelled againſt him; And that he doth alſo admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
vs, that the meanes to recouer that happy life, &amp; to
enioy Gods fauour againe, is to apply our ſelues to that
ſtudy of wiſdome, which is taught vs chiefly in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, We ſpeake not the wiſdome
of the world, but the wiſedome of God in a myſtery,
which is a hid wiſedome. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7. And the ſame Ieſus
Chriſt, which by God was made wiſedome for vs, is our
reſurrection and life.</p>
               <p>Concerning the tree of knowledge of good &amp; euill,
many doe wonder that it was planted in the terreſtriall
and earthly Paradiſe, ſeeing it was the occaſion and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
cauſe of the death of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue.</hi> But Diuines,
and namely S. <hi>Baſil</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> doe wiſely make
anſwere; That God planted no tree that was euill, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made he death, neither did he ſet or plant any ſuch
tree in the garden, to be the occaſion of mans ruine and
deſtruction; but to prooue his obedience, and to beget
in him an habite of abſtinence, and to weane him to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie;
ſo that although this tree was pleaſant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde,
yet was it not meete that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> ſhould
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3512:18"/>
climbe it to ſatisfie their greedy appetites, but ſhould
abſtaine and forbeare ſo to doe, becauſe God had for
bidden them to gather and eate of the fruit thereof. To
conclude with S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> The Lords will was that
the reaſonable creature ſhould ſee, that he was not to be
at his owne caruing and appointment, but as a creature
to yeeld all obedience to his Creatour; and in yeelding
obedience, ſhould finde it to be beſt for his health and
welfare. Thus, then <hi>Adams</hi> eſtate was excellent, and
aboue all things to be deſired, wherein hee abounded in
all ioy, integrity, iuſtice, and holineſſe, if hee had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in this happy eſtate wherein God created him.
But after hee had eaten of the forbidden fruit, of a man
iuſt, happy, and immortall, he became a ſinner, miſerable
and mortall. Theſe things being ſo, wee the miſerable
poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> who haue taſted of the forbidden
fruit, tranſgreſſed in the thing forbidden, and by our
diſobedience brought vpon vs the firſt and ſecond
death, ſeperated and eſtranged our ſelues from God the
author of our life, and of our good being and welfare,
are exhorted and put in minde to haue our recourſe in
true faith vnto that Mediatour, who by his death and
reſurrection hath opened vnto vs the celeſtiall Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
who giueth vs to eate of the tree of life planted in
the Paradiſe of God, Apocal. 2. 7. not of a figuratiue and
typicall tree, but that we might haue a right and intereſt
in Ieſus Chriſt the true tree of life, and in the heauenly
Ieruſalem, which is euerlaſting life, Apocal. 22. 14. For in
our Sauiour is the truth, and the accompliſhment of all
types and figures, and whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhall
not come to condemnation, but ſhall goe from death to
life. Vpon this ſentence S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt Chapter of
his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romanes</hi> 17. Verſe, doth ground this
principle: <hi>The iuſt ſhall liue by faith.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE diſloyaltie and fearefulneſſe of
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> was the violent
downefall of themſelues and their
poſteritie vnto death, and vnto all
the forerunners of death, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
diſeaſes, and wanne, and
pale old age, which is the reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
center, and ſinke of all mans miſeries. To ſpeake
properly, God onely is incorruptible, immortall, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable,
alwayes the ſame, and whoſe yeares alter not.
And although it be ſaid that the ſoule of man is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
(as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> affirmeth in his firſt booke, <hi>De
Trinitate</hi>) yet the true immortality is a perfect immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and vnchangeablenes which no creature hath. In
God onely there is no variableneſſe nor ſhadow of
change, as ſaith Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> Chap. 1. 17. Verſe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe,
our liues are variable and ſubiect to ſuddaine
reuolutions, changes, and chances, and our faire outſide
and feature of body turnes to bee as a moth eaten gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Our dayes (as the Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid to the king
of <hi>AEgypt</hi>) are few and euill or weariſome vpon earth.
<hi>Galen</hi> knowing well that old age a naturall infirmity,
which could not be auoyded, did iuſtly reproue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Philoſopher who braggingly gaue it out, that hee
had a receipt would preſerue a man from growing old;
Although, ſaith hee old age be naturall and ineuitable,
and withall further addeth, that this Philoſopher being
growen to the age of foureſcore yeares dyed of a
hectique feauer. At that time when Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> liued,
the whole world was iudged to be very much weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten,
to be growen old, and that all her former good
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3512:19"/>
dayes were gone and paſt. Behold, what this couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Martyr of Ieſus Chriſt ſaith of the world in his
tractate of death. If the old walles of your houſe ſhould
ſtand totteringly, if the battlement and roofe ſhould
ſhake, if the maine building ſhould leane awry, and the
rafters, poſtes, groundſells, and principall timbers
ſhould bee weake and rotten, all of them giuing you
warning of the perill yee are in, if yee tarry in it, would
yee ſtand to delay and pawſe on the matter, and not get
yee gone in all haſt? The whole frame of the world
doth totter and reele, and being old and neere her end,
ſhee cryes out that ſhee ſtands vpon her laſt legges, and
is quite downe, and you deferre to ſerue God, to ſeeke
your owne ſafety and good, by preuenting thoſe euils
which with her crimes are ready to fall vpon you, and
may bee eſcaped if you timely giue ouer the world.</p>
               <p>Many learned Aſtronomers haue prooued by firme
and ſure demonſtrations, that the celeſtiall Planets
haue altered their courſe and motions, and that the Sun
is come neerer to the earth, that by his warme neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood
(ſuch is the ſpeciall prouidence and will of
God) the Elements, which are become weake in their
influences might be the better relieued. Moſt certaine
it is that the world is growen old, that Kingdomes,
Common-weales, and Cities, haue their flouriſhing
times, and times of decaie; kindreds alſo and whole
families are rooted out, and not a man of them to bee
ſeene aboue ground, and all the creatures which ſerue to
our vſe, and are ſubiect to vanitie, doe after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
groaningly deſire and looke for an end, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 20.</p>
               <p>But to returne to our <hi>Vieillard</hi> or old man, who is the
ſubiect of this diſcourſe, what other thing is old age
then the road way to death? For ſeeing that death is a
ſuffocating and quenching of the naturall heate of the
body, old age makes way to him to enter and ſeize vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the body the ſooner. The older men are, the more
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3512:20"/>
weake and feeble they are in euery thing they doe and
take in hand, and this weakeneſſe of old age can in no
ſort be holpen and redreſſed, though wee ſtriue to doe
it, by keeping the heare from faintings and failings, and
in continuall motion. For life and action end both
at once; it being impoſſible that the liuing creature
ſhould die, ſo long as the heart receiues motion by the
bodies action. Moreouer, old men, who are of a dry
and cold conſtitution, are leſſe fit to vndertake many
actions, exploites, or imploiments. They are not quicke
enough of apprehenſion, their ſenſes fayling them by
little and little, the ſynewes, lineaments, and all the
members of their body doe ſhrinke, languiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,
their ſight and hearing failes them, they are chap-fallen,
and their teeth deny to champ and grinde the
bread they muſt eat. And as God hath appointed eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans race of life how long it ſhall be, and the ſtages
hee muſt paſſe before he come to the end of it, whereof
old age is the laſt ſtage of all; it is not euery mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteny
to goe ſo farre; ſome waxe old ſooner then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
ſome beare their age very well, ſome looke old
and are not: So that old age muſt not be iudged by the
wrinkles in the fore-head, by the white haires, by the
vnweldineſſe or witheredneſſe of the body; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the contrary ſome very old, that haue a ruddy
face and well coloured, a ſleeked and ſmooth skin, and
their haire of a cole-blacke or nutt-browne colour: But
it is fit rather to referre our ſelues to the wordes of the
Pſalmiſt in the nineteenth Pſalme, where mention is
made of the yeares of mans life, and of thoſe things
which often happen therein, and of the many and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
troubles and diſcommodities, wherewith old
men are beſieged and compaſſed about.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Naturaliſts and Philoſophers,
haue vſed to diuide old age as it were into certaine
ſpaces, paces, or progreſſes. The firſt pace and progreſſe,
is from fifty to threeſcore yeares, at which age a man is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3512:20"/>
yet luſty, ſtrong, and youthfull, eſpecially thoſe men
who haue beene wiſe to liue abſtinently and continent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
flying gluttony, drunkenneſſe, whooredome, effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacies,
exceſſiue paines taking, and labours more hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
then neceſſary for the welfare and ſtrength of the
body, ouermuch carking and caring, and ouer violent
paſſions of the minde, which ouerwhelme the ſoule,
not ſuffering it to reſt in quiet, or making it to goe gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and madding heere and there to and fro, as it
happeneth to the licentious, ambitious, couetous, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengefull,
irefull, froward, fearefull, and ſuch like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
who being tempeſted with diſordered thoughts,
and vnruly paſſions, are carried with the rage and fury
of them, ſo farre out of the way of reaſon and beſides
themſelues, that they can hardly hit the right way againe
to the houſe and citie of God. And though that after
fifty yeares the ſtrength of nature doth wane, and by
little and little doth abate and grow weake, yet wee ſee
that men at that age and after, vntilll they bee threeſcore
and fiue yeeres old and vpwardes, are fit perſons to bee
imployed in publike places of charge and command,
as well for their counſell and wiſedome to direct, as for
their ability and valour to execute and performe, wherof
we haue infinit examples in our owne Chronicles and
moderne Hiſtories. At threeſcore and fiue yeares, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
foureſcore, or much about that age old men may be
fit to be counſellours of eſtate, and directours and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours
of families. After this age vntill their dying
day old men are fit for nothing but to ſit in a chaire in
their chamber, to haue their friends, ſeruants, and thoſe
of their houſe to viſite them with reuerent and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſalutations, to haue their children and grand-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
leaping about them, making them paſtime and
ſport, to be entertained with talke and diſcourſe fitting
to their weake capacities; And their part and duty is to
returne them their bleſſing and well wiſhing, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
vp daily prayers for them and all others, wherein
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3512:21"/>
they muſt bee briefe and ſhort, expecting and looking
euery minute, when death will bee ſo kinde as to take
them out of the world.</p>
               <p>There is a kinde of old age ouerhaſtened, ouermuch
worne and broken with ſore labour, ouermuch paines
taking, watchings and ſurfettings in times paſt. Thoſe
that by this meanes are become old, ſhall yet at times for
the moſt part, haue perfect ſenſes and vnderſtanding,
and ſhall haue their blood moderately hote, the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme
heate whereof they ſhall know by skill and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to cheriſh and maintaine: But yet their ſurfeited
bodies ſhalbe tormented with ſharpe diſeaſes, and aches
in their bones, which by fits at times, ſhall put them to
ſuch griping paines and panges in their body, that they
ſhall be able no whit at all to helpe themſelues, and their
neighbours, for whoſe good and comfort they ought
the more carefully to preſerue, and the better to ſee to,
and to order their life, that ſo they may in peace of
conſcience yeeld the better account to God. Briefly,
our life may be compared to the light of a Lampe, which
by little and little goes out, as the oyle that maintaines
it doth waſte and conſume; or to the Moone, which as
it oftentimes ſhines forth and ſhewes it ſelfe, ſo is it as
often ecclipſed and vnder a cloud. But we commonly
ſee the moſt part of men ſweated to death with hote
burning feauers: peſtilences, famines, warres, common
diſeaſes, and diuers miſchances ſweepe them out of the
world, before they come neere by many a dayes iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to the doore of old age. What man would deſire
to ſee the fortith part of his age, if when hee is come to
be able to ſpeake, and to bee of ſome capacity and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
he ſhould be ſhewed in a booke all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
and miſchances, which from and after his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
is, or may happen vnto him, whereof (as <hi>Cicero</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
in his ſecond booke <hi>De diuinatione) Dicaear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
in times paſt wrote a large Volume; But I ſuppoſe
hee had great leaſure, and that all the world could not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3512:21"/>
containe all that might be imagined to fall out in ſome
mens liues in fiftie yeares ſpace. If a man fearing God
will ſeriouſly examine, what things haue paſſed in his
owne life, and make a Iournall or day booke of them,
whereby hee may bee brought to repent him of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
and faults, to amend his life, to lay hold on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of Ieſus Chriſt, to renounce the world, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly
to meditate and thinke vpon a better life, hee
ſhall doe a worthy worke; And I would gladly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
all wiſe old men to ſtay themſelues vpon ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
while ſome young foppiſh, and old doting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſpend their time in ridiculous and ſhamefull ſports
and delights, or which doe by fowle crimes and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deedes
deadly wound their woefull conſciences. It is
recorded by <hi>Lactantius</hi> in his ſecond booke of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Inſtitutions, that the old Poets did circle and incloſe
the life of man within three terminations or periodes,
ouer which they appointed three fatall Ladies, <hi>Atropos,
Lacheſis, Clocho,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Themis,</hi> to
ſpin at the thread of mans life; vnder which faigned
names, was couertly vayled and ſhadowed diuers conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
of our condition in this world, in the firſt,
middle, and laſt age of our life, whereof we purpoſe not
here to moralize or declare the meaning. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in
his booke of the world maketh mention, that by theſe
three daughters of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the ancient people of thoſe
times would repreſent time paſt, time preſent, and to
come; All things by them being tyed to a fatall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie,
which God hath decreed to bee; againſt which the
oldeſt, ſtrongeſt, and youngeſt cannot reſiſt or gainſay.</p>
               <p>The name of Senators is deriued from the Latine
word <hi>ſenes,</hi> which ſignifies old men, who are ſo ſtyled
in honour of their experience, prudence, and wiſedome,
inſeperable companions of ſuch old men, who are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to haue the ſuperintendency and gouernment
ouer others. In the gouernment of all Churches, there
is an Eccleſiaſticall Senate, or conuocation of Elders,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3512:22"/>
who being aſſiſted with the miniſters of the word, haue
their eyes ſtill prying into the manners of men, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
and reclaime them from euill to good, and if they
be good, to make them better. Theſe old men aboue
all others, ought to take heed that they doe not incurre
the ancient reproach and ſcandall of, <hi>bis pueri ſenes,</hi>
which is verified in thoſe who are old in yeares, and in
their manners and actions ſhew themſelues children.
But as it is a rare thing to ſee a yong man ſo well ſtayed,
as an old, or to doe things ſo well and wiſely as an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter
body, ſo is it a lamentable thing to ſee old men
to mocke &amp; make moes one at an other, and to make a
laughing ſtocke of thoſe who are as old as themſelues, or
to doe the vttermoſt they can to diſgrace them, onely to
pleaſe and curry-fauour with young men: Common
faults in theſe dayes, which the <hi>Ancient</hi> of dayes, will
redreſſe when it pleaſeth him. Let vs cloſe vp this
Section with a ſentence of a Romane Stoicke, who
ſayth, That as he maketh not a long voyage, who is
toſſed to and fro at ſea, with ſtormy and tempeſtuous
windes, and doth not proceed; ſo ought we not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that man to haue liued long, who hath not orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his life to make a happy end.</p>

But to come neerer to our purpoſe, let vs firſt diſcouer

that are neerer and more inherent and naturall, and let

               <p>Thoſe wee call the remote cauſes of old age, which
are ſupernaturall, and which proceed from the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> and from the ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
againſt them by the Lord God. For, ſo long
as God was mans friend, the skie, ayre, and earth, were
ſo beautifull to behold, that a fairer proſpect could not
be deſired, and man himſelfe knew and perceiued how
proportionably his bones and ioynts were ſet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and how exquiſitely and perfectly hee was faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
framed, and made as well in body, as in ſoule. But
man taking vpon him boldly to tranſgreſſe Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
and to reuolt from his obedience, had this
puniſhment for his boldneſſe and rebellion inflicted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, that within doores, or touching his inward
man, he was not ſo well fortified with the ſpirit of God,
as he was before, and abroad without doores, or tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
his outward man, all his former bleſſings became
curſes, as appeares by that which is contained, in the
ſentence pronounced againſt him preſently after his
fall. For where before he had liberty, hee was made a
bondſlaue, all the paines hee was put to in that pleaſant
garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> whereof he was owner, was onely to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3512:23"/>
trim it and keepe it handſome, which was an eaſie
worke to the hard labour hee was put to afterward; his
ſleepe and reſt was diſquieted with weariſomneſſe, and
diſcontentments, the Elements, and all other creatures,
and things ordained for the neceſſity of this life, and
which before willingly offered and did their ſeruice
vnto him, were after his fall ſubiect to vanity and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and began to bee enemies, and to proclaime
open warres againſt this wretched Apoſtata man; For
the skie was troubled with tempeſts and ſtormes, the
ayre was infected with noyſome vapours, the earth
brought forth thornes, thiſtles, hurtfull and venemous
hearbes, and the tame and wilde beaſts ſtood with their
ſeuerall weapons ready drawne, to encounter and make
head againſt him. Man being then inuironed with the
dreadfull wrath of God, combred with ſo many euills
and miſeries, and hauing ſo many ambuſhes and traines
laid for him, which hee was to paſſe and make a lane
thorough, it was impoſſible, but that hee ſhould by little
and little waſte his vitall ſpirits, and conſume his
ſtrength, grow old, and ſpeedily come to his death, if
God, of his meere good will to him, had not eaſed his
ſorrowes and troubles, and mitigated his afflictions,
prolonging the date of his yeares, and letting ſome liue
ſo long as it ſeemeth good vnto him. <hi>Dauid</hi> lamenting
this miſerable condition of his, ſaith in the extreame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of all his heauineſſe and troubles; There is no
health in my fleſh, becauſe of thine indignation; My
bones neuer leaue asking, becauſe I haue offended thee,
O Lord, Pſal. 38. 4. And in another place he ſaith, My
dayes are as a ſhadow which vaniſheth away, and I am
as a withered leafe, aſhes haue beene my bread, and I
haue mingled my drinke with teares, becauſe of thine
anger and heauy diſpleaſure, and becauſe hauing aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

all things that are old, doe by little and little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
and giue way to death. Which cauſed ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines
to be of opinion, that our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſt, among other reaſons, would not die of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
or of old age, that hee might not ſeeme to bee dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and turned out of the world perforce, by this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
infirmity, which doth threaten all the children of
<hi>Adam.</hi> As for that which is extraordinary, peculiar,
and not ſo much according to nature, wee may read ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
thereof in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 40. Chap. 30. 31. The young
men are weary and faint, yea the luſtieſt young men
doe ſtumble, and fall flat to the ground; but thoſe that
waite and depend vpon the Lord, doe renew their
ſtrength, their wings doe ſpread, as the wings of an
Eagle; they ſhall runne, and not be weary, they ſhall
walke, and not be feeble and faint. And the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
foretelleth in the 65. Chapter, concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration
of the Church, which is ſpiritually to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;
That hereafter there ſhall be in Ieruſalem no
more a childe of yeares, nor an old man, which ſhall not
accompliſh and fill vp his yeares, for hee that ſhall bee a
hundred yeares old, ſhall bee a young man. By which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3512:24"/>
manner of ſpeech, the Prophet would giue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that all the children of God, ſhall come to that
age and ſtature, where of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> maketh mention, in
the fourth Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> in
ſuch ſort, that they ſhall be exempt from all infirmities,
wherewith children and old men are cumbred, that is,
they ſhall not be children in vnderſtanding, nor poore
ſilly dotardes and ſots, as thoſe are that know not Ieſus
Chriſt, but liue in perpetuall ignorance, Idolatry, and
beaſtly impiety. On the contrary, life prolonged vnto
the prophane, ſhall bee but a preſage and forerunner of
their euerlaſting accurſed condition.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, the inherent and naturall cauſes of
old age, are not all of one ſort and kinde. For ſome of
them are meerely naturall, and ſleepe in our boſomes,
and ſome of them be accidentall and forraine, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of from vs. Thoſe we call meerely naturall, and
which ſleep with vs, which the Naturaliſts &amp; Phyſicians
ſpeake of, to wit, our coldneſſe and dryneſſe of body;
becauſe the more our radicall moyſture dryes vp, and
our blood cooles, the neerer is our ſenſitiue and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life to an end; which hath beene the cauſe to moue
ſome men to thinke, that old men were called <hi>Senes,</hi>
which is as much to ſay as <hi>Semineces,</hi> men halfe dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
old men, eſpecially thoſe that are decrepit, &amp; very
much worne with age, haue cold and dry bodies. For
although, they abound with excrements, and by this
accident ſeeme to haue moiſt bodies, for that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
heat, being too much cooled, and not able to
cheriſh and warme them within, the humour purgeth it
ſelfe at the noſe or mouth: Yet this age is found indeed
and in truth, to be cold and dry. And as death is a totall
ſuffocation of the naturall heate, ſo old age doth by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
and little coole and abate it; whereupon it alſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
that all cold and dry bodies are quickly worne
out and grow old. On the contrary, young men are of
hoate and moyſt conſtitutions. But euen as it is to bee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:3512:25"/>
found in wines, that ſome keepe collour long, and drink
briske and neate, and ſome by and by looſe collour, and
drinke eagre and flat: So wee ſee ſome men waxe old,
and were out ſooner then others. And notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that man wheele about from this place to that,
ſhifting ayres, and vſing all the wayes and means he can,
to cheriſh nature for a while, yet his naturall heate and
ſtrength doth by little and little leaue him; whereupon
doth enſue to aged perſons white haires, looſeneſſe of
teeth, deafeneſſe of hearing, weakneſſe and decay of
ſight, the ſhaking palſie in their hands and legges, and
the chilling and ſhrinking vp of all the whole body.</p>
               <p>This naturall weakneneſſe and dryneſſe, which by
ſucceſſion of time doth inuade all bodies made of earth,
or other matter; beſides, is ſeconded in many men with
diuers diſeaſes, and with old age comming on, which
with greater paine doth haſten it forward, and further it
the more. All theſe euils may be reduced to two heads,
which wee call the labours and toyles of the body di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly,
or both together; and intemperance. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
labour, it is expreſly ſet downe in that ſentence,
immediately after the ſinne of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> which
<hi>Moyſes</hi> doth propound in theſe words: The earth
ſhall bee accurſed becauſe of thee, in ſorrow ſhalt thou
eate of the fruites thereof all the dayes of thy life, in the
ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eate bread, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17, 19.
And in the ninetith Pſalme it is ſaid, That we flouriſh
and wither away all at once; Becauſe, as the Prophet
ſaith, there is no part of our life, how ſtrong and luſty ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
it bee, which is priuiledged and free from ſorrow
and labour. Theſe two are the parents of old age, as
euery man knowes, and there hath beene in our time
young men, which being oppreſſed with extreame
griefe, haue become old in a night; the toyles of the
warres haue made ſome gray headed, in the prime and
flower of their yeares, and it comes by kind to the men
and women of ſome kindreds and families, to be ſoone
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3512:25"/>
gray and old. <hi>Plime</hi> in his ſeuenth booke, and ſeuenth
chapter writeth, That in <hi>Albania,</hi> ſome haue all the
haire of their heads white from their infancy. I my ſelfe
haue ſeene in diuers places where I haue trauelled, fiue or
ſixe yong men, whereof the laſt I ſaw was in <hi>Dauphiné,</hi>
who had all the haire of their heads, as white as a man
of threeſcore and tenne yeares old.</p>
               <p>Touching intemperance, whereof there bee diuers
kindes, a vice to common in young men deſtitute of the
feare of God, and very vnſeemely in old men, being
the harbinger of death, and the Phiſicians beſt friend.
It hath beene an old complaint, ſeeing this preſent life
is ſo ſhort, fraile, and tranſitory, that men doe ſo natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
deſire to liue, and to bee ſo carefull to recouer and
preſerue their health, and to that end ſpare for no coſt,
nor make any bones or difficulties, to turne their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſtomackes into an Apothecaries ſhop of bitter and
vnſauory druges: how almoſt all men by their outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
riots, and ſurfettings, doe bring vpon themſelues
an irkeſome old age, doe before hand as much as in
them lies, with ſharpe and violent diſeaſes haſten their
death, are not wiſe till it bee too late, and neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne,
or finde fault with their ſhamefull luxuries and
riots, till the gout is in their knees, or the dropſie doth
painefully ſhingle them round, or the ſtone doth tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
them, and till the exceſſes and diſorders by them
committed, to the fearefull abuſe of Gods patience,
haue deliuered vp their rotten and crazed bodies, into
the hands of a miſerable old age. They ſhould before
hand remember, and bethinke themſelues, of the old
excellent Prouerb, If thou wilt bee a very old man, bee
old betime. Which doth warne vs to bee carefull of our
health in our youth, flying all ſhamefull and vnruly
paſſions, and ſeeking by the wiſe gouernment of our
ſelues, to obtaine ſuch an old age, as may bee long,
ſtrong, and healthfull. Verily, it is a licentiouſneſſe not
to be borne withall, or tollerated, that a man ſhould
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3512:26"/>
giue his youth, as a preſent to the vncleane ſpirit, by
abandoning it to impudent diſſoluteneſſe, pollutions,
and ribauld impurities, promiſing to himſelfe, that all
ſhall goe well with him at laſt, and conceiting to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
rude and wilde <hi>peccauies,</hi> which deceiue and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leade
him. It is a further euill, and vtterly abominable
in old men, to ſee them ſo farre to haue abandoned
God, their honour, their reſpect of others, all remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of their wretched condition, and of death
which hangs ouer their heads; that they would ſtill
weaue a webb of new yeares for Couerlets, to hide the
foule deedes they commit in horrible hypocriſie, which
at laſt doth transforme them into prophane perſons,
and deſperate Atheiſtes. If the exhortation was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
which the wiſe man hath giuen to euery young
man, in the twelfth Chapter and third Verſe of <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtes,</hi>
To remember his Creatour in the dayes of his
youth, before the euill dayes doe approach; what is to
be ſaid to old men, vpon whom thoſe dayes and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to paſſe and vndergoe, becauſe of the miſeries that
doe accompany them, are already come, more then
halfe gone and paſt, and almoſt at an end? What a
ſhame were it to old men to be reproached, and iuſtly,
that they play at leap frog, vſe fond courtings, and
make fooliſh toyes and brauadoes, and gadde vp and
downe, whetherſoeuer their affections lead them, and
the luſts of their eyes? It were well done to proclaime,
and cry out with a loud voyce, Know that for all thy
euill wayes God will bring thee to iudgement. O hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
where art thou? canſt thou hide thee from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
from thy ſelfe, from God thy Soueraigne? thou
haſt one foot in the graue, and thou wilt fetch gambols
and friskes, and caper aloft, that the world may ſee
thou art ſtill one of her minions, and a fauourite of her
vanities.</p>
               <p>But, let vs conſider the diſorder and licentiouſneſſe
of youth, which ſoone enough procure a miſerable old
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3512:26"/>
age, which beſmeare and rudely handle the ſinner and
lewd liuer. The firſt diſorder and licentiouſneſſe, as
Philoſophers, Phyſicians, and Diuines ſay, is found in
whooredome, adultery, and ſuch like abominable ſins
of the fleſh. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in his Tractate of the length and
ſhortneſſe of life, ſaith, That the males of all creatures,
which bill often with the females, are quickely old,
and doe waſte and conſume their bodily ſtrength. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
ſaid, that <hi>Venus</hi> which doth coole the blood too
much, and weaken the body, is the capitall enemy of
old men, and of hote complections. Long before him
the holy Ghoſt hath giuen a good and wholeſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueate,
and precept thereof, by the inſtruction of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaba</hi>
to King <hi>Salomon</hi> her ſonne, for whom ſhee made ſo
many vowes, <hi>Giue not thy ſtrength to women, following the
way which is the deſtruction of Kings.</hi> If ſuch infamous
diſorders and licentiouſneſſe bee inſupportable and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
in young men, how much more in old men, who
are obliged and bound to remember the holy ſtatutes,
and ordinances of their Soueraigne? who in his inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
law ratified, vnder great paines and penalties,
cryes out; Thou ſhalt not be a fornicatour; Thou ſhalt
not commit adultery; God will iudge whooremongers
and adulterers, and ſuch perſons ſhall not inherite the
kingdome of heauen. Wiſe old men tremble at the
words of their great Prince, who telles them in plaine
tearmes, That whoſoeuer lookes vpon a woman to luſt
after her, hath already committed adultery with her in
his heart. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 28. They mourne and lament, when
this interrogatory is miniſtred vnto them by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle;
Know yee not that our bodies are the members of
Chriſt? Shall I then take the members of Chriſt, to
make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.
Alſo he ſayth, Fly fornication, for euery ſinne which a
man committeth is without the body; but he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
fornication ſinneth againſt his owne body:
Know yee not, that your body is the temple of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3512:27"/>
holy Ghoſt, which yee haue of God, and yee are not
your owne men? 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. &amp;c. The reaſon which
he giues doth ouerthrow and cut off all pretexts, that
young and old men which deſpiſe the truth, can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
or take hold of, to excuſe themſelues, in accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
themſelues. You haue, ſayth hee, beene bought
with a price, glorifie then God in your body and in your
ſoule. Let vs without producing further allegations
and proofes in this caſe, end it with the words of the
ſame Aduocate of holineſſe and truth. This is, ſayth
he, the will of God, and your ſanctification, that yee
ſhould abſtaine from fornication, and that euery one of
you ſhould know, how to poſſeſſe his veſſell in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and honour, and not in the luſt of concupiſcence,
as the Gentiles doe which know not God. 1. <hi>Theſſal.</hi>
4. 3. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Prouerb is, That when the belly is full, the
bones deſire reſt, or we are apt for wanton delights.
Delicious fare, gluttony, drunkenneſſe, cauſe young
men and old to liue ſo diſſolutely and licenciouſly, as
before is mentioned. And, whereas the heathen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſought to finde veritie in wine, the Apoſtle ſaith to
the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> That in wine there is found vanitie, diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteneſſe,
diſorder, and all miſgouernment and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule.
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> as a heathen man ſaid, are the
fewellers and fier-makers to <hi>Venus.</hi> Wine and belly
cheare dull the vnderſtanding, and bereaue a man of
his ſenſes; And it is the onely time for old men, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the notable ſayings of <hi>Salomon</hi> to this purpoſe,
when they are at their great feaſts and iunketting ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.
I will content my ſelfe with repetition of thoſe
ſentences, which are contained in the end of the three
and twentith Chapter of the Prouerbes; where both
the vices are ſet downe together cloſe one by another.
My ſonne (ſayth the wiſe man) giue me thine heart,
and let thine eyes be watchfull, and looke to my wayes.
For a whoore is a deepe ditch, and the ſtrange woman
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3512:27"/>
is a narrow pit; Alſo, ſhee lieth in waite as for a prey,
and will make the trecherous, rebellious, and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours
among men to bee many in number. To whom
is woe is mee? to whom is ſorrow and alas? to whom
are vproares? to whom are murmurings? to whom are
ſtrifes and quarrels without cauſe? to whom are redde
eyes? To thoſe that ſit long at the wine, and which goe
to ſeeke mixt wine: Looke not vpon the wine when it
is redde, when it ſhowes his collour in the cup, and goes
downe pleſantly; It biteth in the end like a ſerpent, and
ſtingeth like a cockatrice. Then thine eyes will looke
vpon ſtrange women, and thine heart will ſpeake lewd
things: Thou ſhalt bee as one that ſleepeth in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of the ſea, and as hee that ſleepeth in the top maſt of
a ſhip. They haue buffetted me, thou wilt ſay, and haue
giuen me many cruell blowes, but I was ſo paſt ſenſe, I
felt not when I did awake: I will yet goe ſeeke after
new wine.</p>
               <p>To theſe elegant ſayings heere deſcribed, I will adde
the precept of our Sauiour, who ſaith, Take heed to
your ſelues, leaſt your hearts be oppreſſed with glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
drunkenneſſe, and the cares of this life, and the laſt
day come vpon you vnawares, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. Saint <hi>Peter</hi>
ſaith, Be ſober and watch, becauſe your aduerſary the
diuell goes about you like a roaring Lion, ſeeking
whom hee may deuoure. 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 8. And laſtly Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> hath this ſentence, That fornicators, adulterers,
effeminate wantons, drunkardes, and other wicked
perſons, who are dead aſleepe, and hardened in their
ſinnes, ſhall not inherite the kingdome of God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi>
6. 10. I forbeare to ſpeake of the diſeaſes, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
of the diſorders, and licenciouſneſſe formerly
ſpecified, or of the extraordinary plagues, wherewith
the iudge of the world can danton, and keepe vnder
the mighty and meane perſons, who neuer haue care of
their conſciences: It ſufficeth mee that they themſelues
are ſenſible witneſſe of them, or if they remaine for a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3512:28"/>
time ſtupide and ſenceleſſe, that the Almighty hath
ſharpe roddes of fearefull vengeance in ſtore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he doth whip them at laſt, though he ſpareth them
a while.</p>
               <p>Let vs ſpeake a word of choller, or anger, which like
a thunderbolt killes millions of young and old men
with the ſword, or with ſuddained ſeaſes. Hiſtories
declare, that in former times <hi>Valentiaian</hi> the Emperour,
and of late in our time, <hi>Mathias</hi> King of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
way, and ſuffering themſelues to bee ouercome
with choler and anger, dyed both of an Apoplexie. It
hath beene ſeen that many old men, furiouſly tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with choler and anger, haue fallen into ſoundings,
convulſions of the ſynewes, and other incurable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.
Women of ripe age, who are too much giuen to
anger and fretting, are commonly ſeene (as a reward
of their indiſcretion) puniſhed with the ſuffocation of
the mother, the falling ſickneſſe, and other ſuch feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſcourges. Couetouſneſſe, ambition, and the loue
of the world, make many men ſo hide bound with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
and griefe, that it is impoſſible to cure or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
them, when they haue moſt need of helpe. Soft
handed ſloth, and idleneſſe, contrariwiſe, exceſſiue la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and violent exerciſes, and countries that are too
cold, mariſh and moyſt, doe all giue an helping hand to
make vp an vnſeaſonable old age. But I haue not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vpon mee to ſcore vp all the accidents and occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to further old age. Happy is hee, that in his youth
giueth not the bridle, to the furious bounding, and
riſing of his vnlawfull deſires, and in his generall and
particular calling amuſeth and applieth himſelfe to all
laudable exerciſes, and ſincere holy duties, doing all
good offices and ſeruice with a franke and free heart to
God, and to his neighbours, and hauing a care to keepe
himſelfe temperate and vnſpotted, from the impure and
rude manners of the world.</p>

ſpeake of mens ages, and the dayes of

Chap. And <hi>Cenſorinus,</hi> in his booke of Natiuities, doe
treate of them at large. Theſe two (namely <hi>Cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>)
doe obſerue, that euery ſeuenth yeare, notable
changes haue fallen out in ſome mens liues; and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
doe hold the ſeuenth yeare to bee Climactericall
and fatall. Thoſe that doe calculate mens Natiuities,
doe hold that yeare fortie nine, which is compounded
of ſeuen times ſeuen; and the yeare ſixtie three, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of nine times ſeuen, is more perillous then any
other, and they haue ſhewed, that at the periodes and
ends of theſe yeares, many worthy and great perſons
haue dyed. <hi>Plato,</hi> iudged the yeare eightie one, which
is compounded of nine times nine, to be the Climacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
yeare, which was moſt to bee feared, which hee
calleth the ſquare number. <hi>Cenſorinus,</hi> doth not thinke
the yeare ſixtie three ſo dangerous, and maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſome men, who haue dyed at the yeare of their
age eightie one, as alſo of others who haue liued longer,
whereof wee haue many examples in our dayes. The
iudiciarie Aſtrologers, are full of vncertaintie and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
in their Art and profeſſion; beſides, conſidering
the great and infinite deuerſity of humane chances and
caſualties, of mens conſtitutions, of the iudgements of
God, they are to preſumptuous to limit the life of man,
to certaine periodes and numbers of dayes, which they
call Climactericall. The members of the body, haue
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3512:29"/>
not efficacy or ability of themſelues: there is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
required a ſymmetry and proportion betweene the
agent and the patient, as betweene the body and the
diſeaſe, betweene the diſeaſe and the cure. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſeuen, is otherwiſe iudged of in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
then in the Colledge of the Phyſicians, who haue
their criticall or iudiciary dayes: And yet there are
learned Phyſicians who differ in opinion about them,
by reaſon of the diuers coſtitutions of mens bodies, of
diſeaſes, whereof ſome are more, ſome leſſe violent; of
the different ayres of countries, according to which
men that liue in them are to gouerne themſelues; of the
skill of Phyſicians, wherein ſome haue better iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and better ſucceſſe then others, and other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
whereby, at this day is diſcouered, that there are
other dayes beſide the ſeuenth day, which appeare to
be criticall. The obſeruations of Diuines vpon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
day, being grounded vpon the textes of <hi>Moyſes,</hi>
are myſticall, and not naturall, nor Aſtrologicall. For
according to the obſeruation of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
the number of ſeuen, which is very often found in the
bookes of the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, ſometimes
indefinitely, ſometimes definitely, doth in his definite
ſence, whether wee take the number of ſeuen dayes, or
ſeuen yeares ſimply, or multiplied, ſignifie compleatnes
or perfection, liberty or reſt. The Lord reſted the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
day. The Iewes had their feaſts which laſted ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
dayes. In the ſeuenth yeare the ground was lay
and vnploughed, and bond ſlaues were ſet at libertie.
The Climactericall yeares of Iubile, compounded of
ſeuen times ſeuen, were a figure of the perfect reſt,
which the Church ſhall enjoy in heauen, after her ſo
many reuolutions and alterations vpon earth. But that
which we haue hitherto treated of old age, doth teach
wiſe old men to call to minde their dayes paſt, and to
thinke vpon the louing mercy of their Creator, who
hath ſo many wayes vpholden them; to pray vnto him
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3512:29"/>
that the ſhortneſſe of their dayes, may cauſe them to
conceiue and conſider ſo much the more his louing pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
toward them, and to take occaſion thereby to
walke with greater reuerence, and feare before his face,
and leaning vpon the ſtaffe of repentance, done in true
faith, to ſay vnto him in all humilitie: O Lord my
God, let my mouth be filled euery day with thy prayſe
and glory; caſt me not off in the time of mine old age,
forſake mee not when my ſtrength falleth mee, for mine
enemies haue ſpoken of me, and thoſe that lay waite for
my ſoule, take counſell together againſt me, ſaying, God
hath forſaken him, purſue and take him, for their is none
to deliuer him: O God, goe not farre from mee, O my
God, haſt thee to helpe mee: Let them bee confounded
and conſumed, that are againſt my ſoule, let them be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
with reproach and ſhame that ſeeke my hurt. But
I will waite continually, and will prayſe thee more and
more: My mouth doth rehearſe daily thy righteouſnes,
and the deliuerance thou giueſt to thoſe that are thine,
although I know not the number of them: I will march
forward in the ſtrength of the Lord, who is euerlaſting;
I will make mention of thy righteouſneſſe onely. O
God, thou haſt taught me from my youth, and hitherto
I haue declared thy wondrous workes, and yet, O God,

vntill I haue declared thine arme vnto this generation,
and thy power to all thoſe which ſhall come heereafter.
Theſe are the words of <hi>Dauid,</hi> contained in the ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
one Pſalme. Moreouer, when the wiſe old man ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
the eye of his thought, vpon the long life of the
Patriarches, hee thinketh not his condition the worſe,
though he liue not threeſcore yeares, or threeſcore and
tenne yeares; but thanketh the <hi>Ancient</hi> of dayes, who
in good time will crowne him with the gifts of a better
life in his celeſtiall Palace. He beholdeth, ſtanding in
the middle Court of the heauenly Citie; and on both
ſides of the pleaſant riuer which there runneth, the tree
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3512:30"/>
of life, bearing and yeelding his fruit euery moneth in
the yeare, whereof he gathereth with the hands of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and charitable faith for his ſoules health, and
marcheth in the ſtrength of the nouriſhment thereof,
vntill hee haue obtained to the full and perfect fruition
of it. As for old age, and the cauſes and degrees there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
he knowes well that God holds the Sun-dyall of his
life in his hand, that he is his ſtrength and the length of
his dayes, that all the yeares, weeks, &amp; houres of his life
are Climacterical: he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenteth himſelfe &amp; reioyceth, to
march forward vnder the ſafe conduct, fauour, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of his Sauiour: And being neere to death, he lifteth

and miſeries, wherewith
old age is reproched, and of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges
and aduantages old men
haue and enioy. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth. That
many men wondred to ſee <hi>Cato</hi> ſo
ſtrong and luſty in his old age, and that hee could ſo
eaſily beare the burthen of it, which is eſteemed more
heauy then huge high mountaines. Not to meddle
with the complaints made by prophane Authors, a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt
the miſeries of our life, all men agree in this point,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3512:30"/>
that old age is miſerable, being as it were the very
ſinke of all extreame miſeries, where they ſettle. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>
writeth, That old men are vnwilling to touch or
handle things, for feare to breake them or let them fall.
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> noteth in his ſecond booke of Politques,
Chap. 2. That the people of <hi>Sparta,</hi> with whom old
age was honourably eſteemed, and in great account;
held opinion, that old men were not to continue long
in any publique office &amp; charge, becauſe their ſtrength
of minde and iudgement did decay; Beſides, their ſight
did faile, which ſenſe of all other is requiſite in men
that haue the adminiſtration of eſtates, which requires a
nimble quicke eye, to ſee into all occurrences and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
There is alledged to this purpoſe, the example of
<hi>T. Manlius Torquatus,</hi> out of <hi>Titus Likins,</hi> in the ſecond
booke of the warres of <hi>Africke.</hi> This man being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
Conſul, refuſed the charge becauſe of his weakenes
of ſight, ſaying, It was a ſhame and diſhonour to the
Generall, or Captain of an Army, to deſire to haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
mens liues and eſtates committed to his truſt, and
not bee able to ſee how to manage them, but by the
ſpectacles of other mens directions: And although the
firſt Band of Souldiers, which had giuen their voyces,
would not alter what they had done, yet <hi>Manlius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
another cohort of ancienter Souldiers to ſit in
counſell about it, was diſcharged of his Conſulſhip.
The ſaying of that wiſe Cynicke <hi>Diogenes</hi> is notable,
who being demanded what was moſt miſerable in the
world, ſtood ſtill, and before hee ſtirred his foot, made
this anſwer: And old man that is in great need and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury.
The ancient <hi>Romanes</hi> had a very rude Prouerb,
to this effect, That men of threeſcore yeares old, were
to be caſt downe headlong, from the top of a bridge to
the bottome, becauſe they were dotardes, and men paſt
labour and vſe, and fit for nothing; or becauſe in times
paſt, the young men of <hi>Rome</hi> (as <hi>Ouid</hi> thinketh, in
ſcorne) would iuſtle old men as they mett them vpon
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3512:31"/>
narrow bridges, that ſo by drowning them, they might
not ſtand in their way, to croſſe and oppoſe them, or
giue their aduice in their doings and counſells. Some
men thinke, that if old age be to be borne withall, and
had in regard, it is of ſuch perſons as are rich, in great
place of honour, and haue plenty of all things in the
world, and in great aboundance. But if wee reckon
right, as we ought, we ſhall finde old age to be charged
with many inconueniences and faults, which are rather
to bee imputed to our corrupt manners and nature.
Fooliſh perſons, accuſe old age of crimes they are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of themſelues, and where they ſhould condemne
and repreſſe their owne peeuiſhneſſe, diſtruſt, impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
folly, and auarice, vices wherewith young men,
and men of middle age are tainted and beſmeared; they
blame old men, ſaying, Old men looke ſcowling, and
are ſullen, ſuſpicious, froward, childiſh, couetous, and
haue forgotten that there is no part of our life, but is
blemiſhed with ſome bad humour, and with one ill qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
or other; as we ſee roſes are not without thornes,
that there is nothing good, but hath euill for a checke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate;
and the rich mans reuenewes are ſerued in with
bitter ſops and ſobs to. But a man that knowes in
great patience, to vſe the traffiques and commodities of
this life, ſees great gaines to grow by it, and excellent
ornaments of vertue; when he conſiders that the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of this preſent life, vnto the children of God, are but
exerciſes of patience, humility, charity, temperance, faith,
hope.</p>
               <p>Commonly diſeaſes in young men, are more paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and dangerous then in old, and we ſee by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that for an old man, there dies ten children
and young men. All the hiſtories of former times doe
point out vnto vs, that ambition, enuy, deſpaire, doe
diſquiet and ſpurgall young men as well as old. Young
men (for the moſt part) ſpend their time badly, and it is
a rare ſight to ſee wiſedome and youth married toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3512:31"/>
Young counſells haue battered downe the walles
of great Monarchies and eſtates, and laid them leuell
with the ground, witneſſe that of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and very
many great kingdomes and eſtates ſince. It is euident
in the hiſtory of the Goſpel, that Ieſus Chriſt healed
more young then old perſons, whereof many inſtances
might be alledged; but the Centurions ſeruant, the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
ſonne of <hi>Naim,</hi> the childe poſſeſſed with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
the daughter of <hi>Iairus,</hi> and the Canaanitiſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
are ſufficient teſtimonies. Who will dare to deny,
but that more young and luſty men doe die, and
are ſlaine in the warres then old. The plague interres
and layes in the graue more children, and men of fiue
and twentie, and thirtie yeares old, then thoſe that bee
older, and young men are commonly ſooner infected
then old. Let vs then giue ouer vnwiſely to obiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
old men, and to vpbraide them with their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and miſeries, ſeeing that the youngeſt men feele
more, which doe put them to more paine and torment.
Whereas, old men are reproched, that they haue giuen
ouer Tennys-play, reuellings, dancing, dallying, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
leaping, vaulting, and hoyting and gallopping vp
and downe, as the wiſe <hi>Barzillay</hi> ſaith, when hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
King <hi>Dauid</hi> to giue him leaue to leaue the court,
and to liue quietly at home by himſelfe. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. So it
is, that old men are diſtaſted and weary of ſuch ſports
and delights; and on the contrary are glad, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reioyce, that they are free from the deſires and luſts
of young men, which doe tyrannize ouer them, and it
is a great ioy of heart vnto them, that being altogether
vnapt to exerciſe the vanities, and ſenſuall delights and
pleaſures of the world, they haue the more leaſure and
vacant time to imploy themſelues, to mortifie their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
luſts and affections, and to meditate vpon the life
to come. Good God, what a wrong doe wee doe to
our ſelues, to inſert and put into the catalogue and bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll
of our euills and afflictions, things which doe bring
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3512:32"/>
health vnto vs, and are very neceſſary documents and
inſtructions vnto vs? There are no people more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
then thoſe, who fooliſhly boaſt, They know not
what ſorrow and miſery meanes, nor neuer had any.
The euills of the world are euills, becauſe men thinke
them ſo, but indeed and in truth they are not euills. As
for example, our bodily infirmitie; men that are truely
wiſe and religious, make a good and profitable vſe of
it. Wee will take for our ſecond example, the approch
and comming of death, which the neerer it comes to vs,
the neerer we ſhall be to our Port, and the ſooner wee
ſhall be within the kennyng and diſcouery of our true
countrey. Thirdly, death it ſelfe is the end of our life,
and the beginning of our happineſſe, which all good
men wiſh for. Let vs then abandon the company of
thoſe idiots, who when old age is farre off from them,
wiſh and deſire it, and when it is come neere, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
at them, reuile and condemne it.</p>

of the minde.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no day, houre, minute, or
moment of our life, which doth not
put vs in minde that we are mortall,
and it is a brutiſh ſtupiditie and
ſenceleſſenes, both in yong and old
men, to promiſe to themſelues to
morrow. But why doe wee refuſe
to liue according to the conditions agreed vpon, when
wee came into the world, to wit, to leaue life in youth, or
in age, when death cals vs, and bids vs to take our leaue
of it? And whence is it, that wee beare ſo impatiently,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3512:32"/>
that which cannot be ſhunned, or avoyded? What
moues vs to look for knotts in Bull-ruſhes, and to make
doubts and difficulties in ſo plaine a caſe? We doe but
peruerſly blame and accuſe the iudge of the world,
when we ſpeake of old age, ſaying, it is miſerable, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it makes vs vnſeruiceable men, and vnfit to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
and meddle with worldly affaires, enfeebles our
bodies, putts vs beſide, and barres vs almoſt of all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
being moreouer the next neighbour to death.
<hi>Cicero</hi> in his Dialogue of Old-age putteth ſuch like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and anſwering them, denyes that wiſe old men are
idle bodies, and as for thoſe which make it their recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and take pleaſure to be ignorant, and to ſit ſtill, and
doe nothing, they are vnworthie the worthie name of
Old men, and deſerue rather to be called Idolles, and
Statues, which artificially are moued by viſes &amp; gynnes.
Great and important affaires are not effected by the
ſtrength, nimbleneſſe, and agilitie of the bodie, but by
counſell, authoritie, iudgement, and example: And as
<hi>Saluſt</hi> ſayth in <hi>Iugurth,</hi> the minde is the guide, chiefe
Captaine, and conductor of mens actions and liues.
But ſeeing that Old men haue alwayes beene eſteemed
to be endued with ſound counſell &amp; wiſedome, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon long experience, by reaſon whereof all thoſe
that haue eminent places of charge in the Church, and
Common-weale are wont to bee called Senators and
Elders. Why ſhall we thinke them lither idle perſons,
who direct and preſcribe vnto others, what is to be
done, and how, and in what order and manner things
are to be done, and though they ſit ſtill themſelues, yet
the whole burthen of the buſineſſe lyes vpon them?
Euen as wee ſee Pilots of Ships, who without much
troubling themſelues, or ſtirring from their places, ſit
quietly at the ſterne, and holding the Rudder, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite
of boyſtrous windes and waues, doe cond and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
their Ships laden with men and merchandize ſafely
to their vnlading port.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:3512:33"/>
And this is the cauſe why in euery well gouerned
Common weale, old men are had in great reuerence
and honour, which they iuſtly deſerue, and young men
frequent their company, and are conuerſant with them,
to benefit themſelues by their counſels and inſtructions.
On the contrarie, wiſe old men are no gybing and ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
Buffones, who with their armes a croſſe take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to trifle out the time, and to idle it at home in their
houſes; but they meditate, imagine, and contriue, and
are alwayes doing one good deed or other, teaching
good leſſons as they grow old, and growing old as faſt
as they teach them, not that they would ſeeme men of
knowledge themſelues, but that others by reaping the
fruits of their labours, might feelingly perceiue that true
pietie and vertue are the guides of their actions. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the weakneſſe of their bodies; as young men
content themſelues, with a proportiall and competent
ſtrength, and affect not to be ſo ſtrong as Bulls, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mells,
or Elephants; ſo old men for their part are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with that condition, which it pleaſeth God to lay
vpon them, and fancie not to be ſo ſtrong as they were
in their youth. It is very decent and fit, that a man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
and giue way to his owne nature, attempting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
aboue his owne ſtrength, but to doe as much as
he can and no more. Therefore <hi>Milo</hi> of <hi>Cretona</hi> made
himſelfe a ridiculous ſpectacle, who being growne old,
and beholding his withered armes, wept dolefully, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
that they were ſtarke dead. Whereupon <hi>Cicero</hi>
vſeth theſe words; Doth the vertue and honour of a
man lie in his armes? It is not rather a mature wiſedome
which makes him renowned to his dying day? Old
age doth not by and by ſo weaken a man, but that by
diuers exerciſes, wherewith he may invre his bodie
and minde, and by ordering himſelfe well in his drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
eating, ſleeping, by giuing himſelfe eaſe, vacancie
and reſt, and not tyring himſelfe, and ſpending his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
with much labour and ſtudie, he may keepe himſelfe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3512:33"/>
from bending in the hammes, and ſtooping in the
ſhowlders, and be ſtill an able and practiſed man. And
that this is true, <hi>Cicero</hi> giues vs ſome examples: Neither
the Kings counſell Table (ſayth he) nor his Court of
Common-pleas, nor my Clients for whom I pleade at
the barre, nor my friends nor ſtrangers can complaine
that they lacke me or my helpe. <hi>Zenophon</hi> reportes, that
<hi>Cyrus</hi> in a Diſcourſe which he made a little before his
death, maintained, that he neuer felt himſelfe to haue a
leſſe able bodie in his age, then he had when hee was
young. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth further, that when he was a childe
he ſaw <hi>L. Metellus</hi> a very aged man ſo ſtrong of body,
that he cared not to be young. <hi>Maſiniſſa</hi> king of <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi>
could not be perſwaded to goe couered with a Hatt
on his head, when he was foureſcore and ten yeares old,
but in raine, hayle, froſt, and ſnow, went bare headed.
<hi>Appius</hi> when he was very old &amp; blind gouerned a great
familie; had a ſpirit, like a bow, alwayes bent, prepared,
and reſolued to dare, defye, and wraſtle with old age,
in ſuch ſort, that he bore all the ſway of Command in
his houſe, and kept all his family in ſo good awe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that he was reuerenced of his children, and belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of his neighbors. Some doe accuſe old age in men
that it makes them heauie headed and dull, to haue no
mirth nor muſicke in them, and to abandon and caſt of
all pleaſures. But if they account the follies, fond iolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and gambolles of youth for true pleaſures, their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
is falſe, and they ſpeake iniuriouſly of Old age,
which procures great good vnto vs, blotting out quite,
whatſoeuer is moſt vicious and bad in young men, to
wit, carnall pleaſure, a capitall enemies to vs all, which
headlong plungeth all thoſe that are vaſſalls and ſlaues
vnto her, into gulfes of eternall perdition, is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of gluttony, drunkenneſſe, whoredome, adulterie,
of all diſſoluteneſſe, and debauched villanies, and in fine
is the cauſe of the ruines of Common weales and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
Old men which are free from the coulp and guilt
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3512:34"/>
of theſe and the like vices and abominations, haue leſſe
torture and torment of mind, and haue the more reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and authoritie giuen them, which is the Crowne
of their age. The approches of death ſeeme to ſtrike a
terror and aſtoniſhment into many old men. But wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
is the man, who all the time of his life hath not
learned to make light account of death, which he ought
before hand to envre and frame himſelfe to wiſh for and
expect, ſeeing death is his guide and conuoy to heauen,
and bringeth with him a <hi>dedimus poteſtatem</hi> to put him
in poſſeſſion of his euerlaſting inheritance, which the
Sonne of God hath adiudged vnto him, which iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is entred in deſpite of Sathan, who continually in
this world brings cauelling ſuites and actions againſt vs
to moleſt and interrupt vs in our iuſt clayme thereunto.
More occaſions and cauſes therebe of diſeaſes in yong
men, by reaſon they are put to all hard labours, and iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes,
whereby for the moſt part they do vntimely end
their liues, ſo that death doth as ordinarily ſeize vpon
them, as vpon old men. Some doe reply that ſuch yong
men haue a hope to liue long, but it is a fooliſh perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
by reaſon that they take that which is doubtfull
for ſure and certaine, and that which is falſe for true.
As the time of Autumne ſucceedes the ſpring time and
Summer, ſo there is nothing more naturall to old men
then to die. The death of young men reſembles a
great flaming fire, which is not quenched but with
much water; but old men are like a dry chipp of wood,
or a ſmall gloing fire, which dyes and goes out of it
ſelfe. Why ſhould wee mourne and lament for him,
who when he dies findes immortalitie, and whoſe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
and ſtudie hath beene from his tender youth to
contemne death, that his ſoule might be at reſt in a place
conuenient. This is briefely the ſubſtance of that
which <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Dialogue of old age doth handle
more at large. Chriſtians haue more excellent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
helpes, and refuges againſt the miſeries of old age,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3512:34"/>
and the aſſaults of death, which hereafter in their order
we will declare. That old age hath his particular miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in regard of the bodie and minde we are not now
to diſpute: It is that which we are next to ſpeake of.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Erily, that man which ſhould take

age is exempt and priuiledged
from all diſcommodities and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
ſhould reaſon againſt ſence,
experience, and nature it ſelfe,
which beares witnes againſt him.
For although the life of man, from the beginning to
the end, hath no part of it free from diuers calamities,
which it is to reſiſt and conflict, and that man from his
birth ſeemes to bee made to liue in paine and ſorrow:
Yet wee muſt know and acknowledge, that feeble and
decrepit old age is incident to many particular miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which are the cauſes that weake old men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
teſtie, froward, ſad, melancholy; eſpecially
thoſe, who are cholerique, fretfull, and impatient by
nature, or are not armed and prepared before hand to
vndergoe ſuch aſſaults, and to ſtoope to the miſeries,
which the laſt age of their life ſhall lay vpon them. It is
a well worne ſaying, That as lees and dregs doe ſinke
downe, and lie at the bottome of veſſels: ſo the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
noyſome humours, and all the miſeries of our
life, doe ſettle in old age their laſt lodging place. One
compares very fitly, the condition of old men to a
little City, halfe ruinous and decayed, whoſe walles
moulder away, are almoſt all broken downe, and is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3512:35"/>
altogether vnprouided of munition, and victualls, to
fortifie and ſuccour it ſelfe if need require. For wee ſee
in all old men, their eye ſight by little and little to faile
them; that they are duller and deaffer of hearing, their
teeth to fall out, their hands and feet to haue the palſie;
briefly, this building of clay and ſpittle, to haue many
defects and decayes, and daily to waſte and impaire
more and more, expecting a totall ruine. But the more
theſe euills doe preſſe and moleſt vs, the more we thinke
vpon, deſire, and expect to make an end of our painefull
pilgrimage, to hit the marke we ayme at, &amp; to be quietly
ſeated in our true dwelling place, &amp; eternall habitation.
Thoſe perſons, who from their youth haue learned to
ſubmit themſelues to the diuine prouidence, and to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
and reuolue with themſelues a better life, doe
with greater caſe ſuſtaine and beare all the miſeries of
their long age; And the weakeneſſe of body in old
men, doth not hinder them from doing that which is
meete and behoouefull for them to doe. But it is a great
reproach and obliquie to old men, if in the eye of good
men, without ſhame or feare of their great and ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Iudge, who is to bee feared, they imitate and
act the foule enormities and ſcandalous manners of
ſome wilfull impudent young men. But if, according
to the opinion of <hi>Seneca,</hi> there is nothing more wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in the world, then the man who hath neuer had
any misfortune, croſſe, or affliction: Let vs deeme him
happy, which beareth his afflictions in ſuch ſort, that
hee is confident and aſſured quickely to haue a releaſe
and end of them, to his credite and true contentment.
But to proceed, old men are not without laudable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
imployments, and delightfull ſtudies and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations.
If their feet bee ſlow of pace; their mindes
are quicke enough and ready to conceiue, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
as <hi>Euripides</hi> ſaith. If young men doe know how
to vſe the <hi>Stoccado,</hi> the <hi>Punto reuerſo,</hi> and are expert
and cunning in their weapon; it is old men doe direct
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3512:35"/>
them how to mannage a quarrell, and when to fight for
their aduantage and honour; if heerein wee will giue
credit to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> wh writes, that it belongs to young
men to beare Armes, and for old men to conſult and
determine, what is beſt and profitable for the good and
welfare of the State. Old men then, are the heads of
the politicke body, and young men are the armes. As
for holy meditations, wherewith the ſoule is rauiſhed,
and tranſported aboue the clouds, they require not
great ſtrength of body; but on the contrary, when the
wiſe <hi>Vicillard,</hi> or Old man, cannot without great paine
ſtirre hand and foote, and lies bedred, hee comforteth
and cheeres vp himſelfe, with diuine meditations ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to his age; and while fooles and diſſolute perſons,
confound themſelues in baſe ſhamefull pleaſures, hee is
priuately conuerſant and talking with God, hearkens
vnto him inwardly ſpeaking to him, not daring once
to looke vp with his eyes, doth queſtion and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
with him; humbly prayes and ſues to him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes,
and obtaines fauour of him, to grant him his
humble requeſt and deſires. Young men, that are ſo
forward and bold to prouoke old men to anger and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure,
feele now and then that old men haue ſtrong
and forcible reſiſtances, ſharp ſwords and words to, to
daune and diſmay the ſtouteſt of them: As in our time
it hath chanced to many great and meane perſons; who
in regard of their age, weakeneſſe of body, being eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as dead men, haue made young men to tremble
and quake, who earſt purpoſed to plucke their skin ouer
their eares, before they had beene laide in their beds
aſleepe. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> glanceth at theſe things, and tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
them by the way, in his letters to S. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
I pray you (ſaith hee) doe not challenge and dare one
that hath been an old beaten Souldier both by ſea and
land, to ſingle combate and to hand blowes with you,
who are but a young nouice, and freſh-water Souldier:
remember <hi>Dares,</hi> and <hi>Entellus</hi> in <hi>Virgil,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cicero</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3512:36"/>
that <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> the chiefe Generall of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
Army, was wont to wiſh for tenne <hi>Neſtors,</hi> that is,
eloquent and wiſe counſellours, and not for ten <hi>Aiaxes,</hi>
or ſtout Captaines, and bold daring warriours. <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Maximus,</hi> in his eight booke, chap. 1. maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of certaine old men, who being deepely ſtrooken
in yeares, would not giue ouer to doe ſeruice for their
Countrie, and to the State, and had good ſucceſſe in
their enterpriſes: Among others, hee nameth <hi>Marcus
Valerius Coruinus,</hi> who liued a hundred yeares, and was
ſixe times Conſul: Alſo <hi>Metellus,</hi> who being a very
aged man, was notwithſtanding choſen chiefe <hi>Pontifex,</hi>
and worthily diſcharged the place: Laſtly, <hi>Appius,</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
the blinde; who in his decrepit old age, cauſed
his Litter to be made ready, wherein he was carried to
the Senate houſe, where hee gaue his negatiue voyce,
and croſſed the treatie of a diſhonourable peace with
<hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> that it went not forward.</p>
               <p>Some doe obiect, that old age is to be feared, becauſe
it bleares mens eyes, or puts them out quite. But will
you reproach <hi>Appius,</hi> that he was blinde, who gaue eyes
to his weake ſighted countrey, to ſee what was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and behoouefull for it? I ſolemnely affirme, that
loſſe of ſight is a diſcommodity, which doth diuerſly
ſometimes blaſt and ſmite young men from their cradle,
either thorough ſome defect in nature, or by accident.
Some ſee beſt a farre off, others neerer hand: ſome can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
indure to looke vpon the Sunne, others are ſo
weake ſighted, that the light of the day doth offend their
eyes, ſome are borne ſtarke blinde, and ſome purblinde.
Howſoeuer this may bee, yet old men are not without
the comfort, which blinde <hi>Aſclepiades</hi> had; who plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
ſaid, That hee had this benefit by his blindneſſe,
that before he went all alone by himſelfe; but ſince hee
was blinde, hee went not abroad any whether, but hee
had the company of him that did lead him. The ſolace
and comfort of a wiſe old man, who is become ſtarke
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3512:36"/>
blinde or ſees but very little, is that hee hath no more
the ill hap to ſee ſo many diſſolute, laſciuious, arrogant,
impudent, mad-braine-ſicke, and lewd perſons, with
whom the earth is ouerſpread. Hee can make the ſame
anſwere, which a good Father made to <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtata,
who to mocke and ſcoffe ſo much the more at
Chriſtians, reproched and hit him in the teeth with his
imperfection of ſight; I prayſe God, ſaid the good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he hath giuen mee the grace not to ſee ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
a man as thou art. Let vs adde that which the good
<hi>Anthony,</hi> heretofore liuing a <hi>Hermites</hi> life, not farre from
<hi>AEgypt,</hi> ſaid to <hi>Didymus</hi> the blinde man of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
a very pious and religious perſon, and of ſingular lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
as <hi>Sozomene</hi> reports in his third booke, chap. 14.
Thou oughteſt not, friend <hi>Didymus,</hi> to hold it grieuous
or moleſtfull to haue loſt thy ſight, which myce, lynxes,
and other brute beaſts haue very piercing and quicke,
but rather to be glad, and to iudge thy condition hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
that thou haſt eyes like the eyes of the holy Angells,
by whoſe helpe thou beholdeſt the Lord, and doeſt
perfectly ſee and diſcerne the cauſes of his workes.
But what auayles it to haue eyes in our head, if our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
bee ſenſuall and brutiſh, if it bee clouded
with the darkeneſſe of ignorance: Briefly, if in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and diſcourſe of good things, wee be beetle-blinde,
and ſee no more then a mole? How great cauſe haue we
then to begge of the Lord with <hi>Dauid,</hi> 119. Pſalme, To
open our eyes that wee may be able to behold, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
myſteries of heauenly knowledge? The ſoule
(as <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaid in his firſt booke againſt <hi>Eunomius</hi>) is
glad, and reioyceth, which inquiring into things that
bee diuine, hath ſo good eye ſight, that ſhee can pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
and pry into things that are not to bee perceiued
by ſenſe, and can contemplatiuely behold the Lord,
with whom ſhe ſhall dwell for euer.</p>
               <p>Some find fault with and complaine of their memory,
the infirmitie whereof <hi>Seneca</hi> the Oratour, in the firſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3512:37"/>
booke of his controuerſies, doth number among the
principall hazards of old age, and ſayth, it doth firſt faile
and decay: that in times paſt hee had a very pregnant,
ready, and great memory, but long age had brought
him to this paſſe, that he durſt not relye or preſume vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his memory, in any thing he ſhould engage himſelfe
to doe, or to promiſe. <hi>Plinie</hi> in his ſeuenth booke, 14.
chapter, ſayth, That the memory is one of the principall
houſe imployments, and vtenſiles of our life; and that
<hi>Simonides</hi> did profeſſe to know the art thereof, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
that nothing is more fraile and brittle in man, then
memory; which by ſundry diſeaſes and miſcheeuous
accidents, is impaired and made weake, ſo that by a
ſmall accident, ſome haue forgotten the names of their
neereſt allyes, ſome the names of their ſeruants, and
ſome their owne names, as <hi>Meſſala Coruinus</hi> did.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Cicero</hi> maintaineth, that forgetfulnes is not a vice
of old age; but rather of a dull, ſluggiſh, heauy age, which
had need to be ſtirred &amp; ſpurred to imitate the ſchollers
of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> whoſe manner was euery night to repeat
all they had learned, ſaid, and done the whole day. Wee
doe not readily forget that which runneth moſt in our
mind, and which wee doe moſt effect: As old men doe
preciſely remember all their ſeuerall debtors, and their
manner of dealing, and all the coffers, cabinets, odd
holes and corners, where they haue laid vp and hid
their iewels and gold: They carry an exact inuentory
of them in their heads.</p>
               <p>It is good oftentimes to put many things out of our
minde, and to forget them, that ſo wee may remember
our Creatour and Redeemer, and whoſoeuer remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth
him, may ſay; He hath forgotten nothing: Who,
becauſe wee are of our owne nature ſubiect to tread vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our feet the memory of good things, hath inſtituted
that in memory of him, wee ſhould often communicate
in the holy Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Me thinketh, that it were expedient here, by all waies
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3512:37"/>
and means, to remember the prouidence of our all good
and merciful Father in heauen; who foreſeeing, that the
laſt age of our life ſhould bee obnoxious, and ſubiect to
many euils and infirmities, hath giuen vs many remedies
for our eaſe and comfort, which are to bee found in the
bookes of learned Phyſicians; whereof it is not conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for vs to make a ſcrowle or catalogue in this Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
becauſe wee preſent not a booke of receites for
the body, but of inſtructions neceſſary and fit for euery
wiſe old man. Onely we will ſay, that the Creatour hath
beene bountifull in giuing infinite meanes to thoſe, who
delight not in ſhamefull and exorbitant luxuries and
riots, to maintaine themſelues in a competent ſtrength
of body, vntill they be threeſcore and ten yeares old:
<q>
                     <l>Yea their old age, euen as a tree,</l>
                     <l>With goodly fruits ſhall loaded be:</l>
                     <l>Whoſe branches ſteept in ſummers dewe,</l>
                     <l>Shall goelie be, and greene of hewe.</l>
                     <l>Which being ſeene to euery eye,</l>
                     <l>Aloud to all doth teſtifie,</l>
                     <l>Gods goodneſſe and integritie.</l>
                     <l>Who is my ſtrength and my defence,</l>
                     <l>And keepes me by his prouidence:</l>
                     <l>That I doe liue without offence.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is impoſſible in mine owne opinion, that ſo great
ingratitude ſhould enter into the minde, or ſoule of a
wiſe old man, to forget the innumerable bleſſings, which
God in fauour hath enlarged vnto him, and to complaine
more of the euills which he doth iuſtly ſuffer. Iuſtly then
did <hi>Cicero</hi> taxe and blame <hi>Cecilius,</hi> who maintained that
among other the miſeries of old age, this was one, that
liuing long, we ſee many things which doe diſcontent
and diſpleaſe vs. For wee ſee alſo other things, which
doe giue vs all contentation, pleaſure, and delight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we are altogether vnworthy, if God would ſtrictly
examine our life. But <hi>Cecilius</hi> addeth further, that it is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3512:38"/>
a miſery and a death to bee contemned, and to bee a
burthen to others, as it happeneth to thoſe old men, who
for many yeares lie bedred of the gout, and are a trouble
to themſelues, and to all their ſeruants and family, by
reaſon their weake decrepit old age hath made them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to helpe themſelues, or to doe any thing, but lie ſtil
expecting to be laid in their graue. I ſay, that theſe are
offences and diſcommodities, which proceed from the
frowardneſſe or ingratitude of our ſeruants, and thoſe of
our houſe, or we our ſelues are the cauſe of them, hauing
liued ſo wretchedly and vntowardly that wee haue not
gained the loue of any: or our owne follies haue made
vs to be had in contempt of euery one, or we doe receiue
the reward of our owne arrogant and inſolent behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
towardes our anceſtors, fathers, mothers, maſters,
ſchoole-maſters, &amp; tutors, whereby it commeth to paſſe,
thorough the iuſt iudgement of the Almighty, that our
children, ſeruants, or thoſe of our family doe render the
like vnto vs. Not to harpe vpon this ſtring: if old men
bee odious, deſpiſed, and ſcorned, it is of graceleſſe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines,
for whom the gallowes groans, who neuer think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the frailty of man, and that they themſelues are
as ſubiect to the vncough and ſtrange accidents, which
in this life doe blaſt great and meane perſons, doe
as proudly diſdaine and vilifie the honour of old age,
as they doe the maiſtie of God, which they blaſpheme,
reuile, and rend and teare it aſunder. How ſhould ſuch
deſperate wretched perſons regard old men, when they
ſhew themſelues ſo refractary and vntractable, at the
good admonitions and reproofes of euery man that
grauely telles them of their follies and faults to haue
them abhorre and deteſt them? Reuerend old men
are worthy of commiſeration, and to bee ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in their infirmities, to bee honoured in their age,
and the wiſer ſort of perſons doe ſo eſteeme and
regard them; yea, euen thoſe old men, againſt whom
information is giuen, and complaint is made that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3512:38"/>
they are Dotardes, whoſe number for the moſt part is
but ſmall. Howſoeuer their caſe be, theſe Dotardes,
theſe twice children, theſe that are become childiſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
doe leaue among good men an honourable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
of themſelues, and haue no leſſe at their ſeruice
their holy Angells, beholding the face of their Father,
and watching ouer them, then heretofore thoſe little
children had of whom Ieſus Chriſt ſpeaketh in the 18.
Chapter of S. <hi>Mathew.</hi> This is ſpoken of wiſe old men;
as for thoſe men who hauing not enough glutted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with the ſlipps and peccadills of their youth, with
the ſinnes of their middle and manly age, doe fill vp the
meaſure of their iniquities with the vices of a ſhameleſſe
old age, killing their bodies by foule exceſſes and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits
of gluttony, drunkenneſſe, whoredomes, adult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
by madd bickerings and ſuddaine quarrells, riſing
of choller and anger, by vnlawfull practiques, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt
dealings, proceeding of couetouſneſſe, and by nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard-ſhipp,
and extreame parſimony on the one ſide;
by prodigalities, profuſe and inordinate expences, to
ſatiate their accurſed luſtes and appetites on the other
ſide: Theſe men build themſelues moſt noyſome and
naſtie priſons, where they are to be ſeene now and then
to languiſh long, and pyne vnder the vneaſie yoake, and
in the ſtockes of ſharpe diſeaſes, which doe torment and
torture them in the ſight of all the world, without any
pittie or eaſe, vntill the firſt death deliuer them ouer to
the ſecond death, to be for euer tormented in hell fire,
if in time they doe not reforme &amp; reclaime themſelues,
and forſake their wicked wayes, to dedicate their ſoules,
their bodies, and goods to glorifie God according to
his holy will. The beſt and choyceſt antidote, which we
can preſcribe to old men againſt the miſeries which ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
ſeize on them in their old age, is that before hand
they ſubdue themſelues, get the vpper-hand and maſter
thoſe paſſions, which doe tyrannize and cruelly Lord it
ouer Atheiſts and prophane perſons, that they chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3512:39"/>
vnder-goe and endure the miſeries which doe aſſayle
their bodies, that they liue with an vpright and pure
conſcience before God and men; that they alwayes
haue their ſoule lifted vp, and rauiſhed at the ſaying of
the Apoſtle, that their habitation, or right and priuiledge
of Cittizens is not in this world (for here we are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and way-faring men) but it is in heauen; that
they may be ſtrong in the Lord, in whom wee are able
to ouer come all things, according as it pleaſeth him to
fortifie and ſtrengthen vs, euen to ouercome Sathan,
the world, our owne concupiſcence, and ſenſualitie;
finally, as the Prophet ſpeaketh in an excellent Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
in the nintie-one Pſalme;
<q>
                     <l>On Lyons fell, and Lyons whelpes, and Vipers full of gall,</l>
                     <l>And on fierce Dragons they doe tread, and haue no harme at all.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>They alwayes remember that worthie ſaying of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
(which he himſelfe forgot in his diſtreſſe, and when
it behooued him more carefully to thinke on it) to wit,
that he that is ſlow to anger, is better then a mightie
man, and he which maiſtereth his owne affections is to
be preferred before him that winneth a Cittie. <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.
32. But it behooueth vs, to treat a little more at large of
the chiefeſt paſſions of the minde in old men, to the end
that the wiſer ſort may bend all their forces ſo much
the more againſt them, and may earneſtly
endeuour to conſecrate the reſt of their
dayes to the glory of their ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
who is called the

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Poet in times paſt, called Old age the
ſeaſoning, and as it were, the ſauce of
wiſedome. And ſome haue thought that
the word <hi>Seigneur</hi> is deriued from <hi>Senior,</hi>
which ſignifies, an Elder, or Auncient:
As if authoritie, honour, reſpect, or reuerence did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine
to none but thoſe that were auncient, being
indeed vnfit attributes for young men, whom if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
or regard, it is for their ripeneſſe of wit, and
capacities, and in regard they doe wiſely diſcharge and
performe the ſeruice, buſineſſe, and matters committed
vnto them. In the lawes of <hi>Pepin,</hi> in the fift Booke of
the Lawes made concerning free men, and the ninth
title, there is read to this purpoſe of our <hi>Senior,</hi> which
ſignifies <hi>Seigneur,</hi> this conſtitution vnder theſe termes:
<hi>Nullus comparet caballum, bouem, iumentum, vel aliam
rem, niſi illum hominem cognoſcat qui eum vendiderit, aut
de quo pago eſt, vel vbi manet, et quis eſt eius ſenior,</hi> that is,
that no man buy a horſe, oxe, nor labouring, or ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
beaſt, nor any other thing, vnleſſe he know the ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
or of what village he is, or in what place he dwells,
and who is his Lord and maiſter. But this is ſpoken by
the way. To proceed, It is very apparent that the heate
of paſſions in youth beginning to coole and ſmoother
out in old men, many vices are extinguiſhed and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
in them, by the helpe and aſſiſtance of long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
which makes them wiſe and aduiſed. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
which, wee yet doe confeſſe, that they
haue great imperfections, and that their owne folly doth
often enough beate them, and make them to ſmart;
the corrupt nature of <hi>Adam</hi> in his poſteritie being not
to be quite aboliſhed but by death, is aboliſhed in ſome
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3512:40"/>
leſſe, and in others more during this pilgrimage, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as it hath pleaſed God to permit ſome ſooner then
others to be better taught, trayned vp and invred to
bow, and more willingly to ſtoope vnder the yoke of
the Lord, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpeaketh in his third Chapter, and
27. Verſe. There are found very worthie old men,
who in their very old age, by the direction of the holy
ſpirit, and a right trayning vp, doe muſter in troopes,
and ſhewe like victorious Captaines and Leaders of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
For hauing diſcomfitted and broken the rankes,
and ſquadrons of diuers corrupt affections, which were
their pernicious enemies, they aduance and carry them
as excellent Trophies of victorie, and with hearts lifted
vp behold the heauens, and the reward of their calling
aboue, being able truly to ſay with the Apoſtle 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 10. when I am weake then am I ſtrong.</p>
               <p>To come againe to our poynt in hand, old age hath
his imperfections, and there be old men, who are cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
and tortured with particular paſſions, and diuerſe
diſeaſes, and peſtes of the minde, commonly called the
euils of guilt of ſinne, and the euils of puniſhment of ſin.
The puniſhments of ſinne are torments and vexations
of minde, griefes, paſſions, feares, and other miſeries,
which at firſt, being inflicted for the puniſhment of ſin,
doe alſo ſometimes afflict the children of God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as it hath pleaſed the Lord to exerciſe them, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
according as the humour of choller or melancholy
doth abound, and is predominant in ſome more then in
others. Phyſitians long ſince confirmed by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
grounded vpon the rules of ſcience, and a
right knowledge of cauſes, haue diſcouered theſe euils,
and diuers remedies for them, in ſuch ſort, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denyed, but that the ſtudie of true Philoſophie,
the continuall combat and conflict of a good minde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the defects and frailties of his owne inordinate,
and ouer-boyling paſſions, a ſetled forme and order of
life, feruent prayers to God to repreſſe theſe euils, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3512:40"/>
to weed out this euill nature, are of great vſe vnto thoſe
men, who doe make vſe of ſuch helpes and remedies.</p>
               <p>We call the euils of guilt of ſinne, the vices of the
minde, which ſolicite vs to luſt after, and to doe things
repugnant to the law and will of God, and to the office
and dutie of a good man. It muſt be confeſſed that old
men, who haue not beene well inſtructed and trayned
vp from their infancie, or be of a harſh, ſtubborne, craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
ſlie-ſubtile nature, and diſpoſition, are not without
diuers groſſe and enormous ſinnes: Yea, ſo it is (but
to the vtter confuſion and ouer-throw of themſelues,
and their families) that they growing ſtill older and
older, ſuch ſinnes are not mortified in them, but on the
contrary, the older they grow, the more doe malice,
braſen-faced impudencie, wickednes and villanie take
deepe roote in them. Whence doe proceede theſe nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Prouerbes, and by-words, old fornicator, old gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
old babler, thankeleſſe old man, old drunkard, and
more old drunkards then old Phiſitians: Formes and
partes of ſpeech, by which the imperfections of mad,
doting old men are bewrayed and diſcouered, and wiſe
old men are ſo much the more put in minde, how they
ought to beare, and behaue themſelues in the ſight of
God, of his Church, of their owne ſeruants and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
of their friends which wiſh them well, and of their
enemies which wiſh them ill, ſeeking to diſcredit, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
and defame them. It is lamentable to ſee ſome
old men to idle out the time in potting, tipling, and
ſwilling in drinke; others to ſeeke after meats and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocatiue
drugs, to enflame and ſtirre vp their beaſtly
luſtes, not regarding the commandement of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
in the ſecond Chapter of his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> ſecond
verſe, where he willeth auncient men to bee ſober,
graue, diſcreete, and aduiſed. Such perſons doe yet leſſe

poore man that is proud a rich man that is a lyer, and
an old adulterer, which doteth, or is without vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
A wiſe man ſayd, that is an imputation to an old
man to ſpeake of vnchaſt courting, and dalliance, much
more to be deuoted to it: yea, when it were fit to make
him a comely withdrawing roome farre from the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of the world, and the vncleane ſpirit, then to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and bemyre himſelfe in the perillous pleaſures of
the world, is to neglect and diſpiſe the wiſe admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>Salomons</hi> mother, and little to conſider the euils
which happened to that wiſe Prince, for not hauing
conſidered it well, when ſhe left him this worthie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<hi>Giue not thy ſtrength to women.</hi> Pro. 31. 3. Our
wiſe <hi>Vieillard</hi> will remember, that if true wiſedome
lodge in his heart, and the knowledge of truth deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his ſoule, ſhe will deliuer him from the ſtrange wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which ſmootheth her words, which forſaketh the
guide of her youth, and forgetteth the couenant of her
God. For her houſe leaneth vnto death, and her pathes
lead vnto the dead. Not one of them which goe vnto
her doe returne againe, neither take they hold of the
wayes of life, <hi>Pro.</hi> 2. v. 10. 16. 17. &amp;c. Keepe thy way
farre from her, and come not neere the dore of her
houſe, leaſt thou giue thine honour vnto others, and
thy yeares to the cruell: leaſt the ſtranger be filled with
thy ſtrength, and thy labours be in the houſe of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 5. v. 8. &amp;c. <hi>Salomon</hi> hauing in the ſame place
propounded notable things to this purpoſe, euen as a
wiſe Father, who with teares trickling a pace downe his
cheekes, would admoniſh his lewd ſtubborne ſonne,
addeth, why ſhouldeſt thou my ſonne bee tranſported
with the loue of a ſtrange woman, or embrace the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
of a ſtranger? ſeeing the wayes of man are before
the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his pathes.
The ſame wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> further ſayth, in the ſixt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
The woman which luſteth, hunteth after the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life of a man. Can a man put fire into his boſome,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3512:41"/>
and his cloathes not be burnt? ſhall a man goe vpon
hote coales, and his feete not be burnt? ſo he that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into his neighbours wife, ſhall not bee innocent
whoſoeuer toucheth her: Alſo he that committeth adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
with a woman is deſtitute of vnderſtanding, hee
that doth it deſtroyeth his owne ſoule. In the chapter
following, hee deſcribeth a ſhameleſſe and impudent
woman, who by her crafts, and ſubtile deuices brings
thoſe to deſtruction, who for want of vnderſtanding
ſuffer themſelues to be ſeduced by her enticing wordes,
comparing ſuch idiots to Beaſtes that are led to the
ſlaughter houſe, to fooles that are layed and chayned vp
in Priſon to be corrected; to Birds which willingly fall
into pit-falles, and ſnares. Let our wiſe <hi>Vieillard</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that the author of all holineſſe hath expreſſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
whoredome and adulterie, not onely in the
act, but alſo in the affection. In ſtead of beholding with
an euill eye thoſe women, whoſe company he ought to
ſhunne and avoyd, let him read, or cauſe to be read vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him the places of holy Scripture, which we goe about
to quoate vnto him, and which are the parts and points
of the inditement according to which God will judge
whore-mongers, and adulterers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4. The places
are theſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 3. Behold thou art dead becauſe of
the Woman which thou haſt taken; ſhee was onely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and not defiled. <hi>Gen. 26. 10. Abimelech</hi> ſayd to
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> who ſomewhat vnaduiſedly behaued himſelfe in
the behalfe of his wife <hi>Rebecca;</hi> it was a narrow hazzard
that none of the people lay not with thy wife, and that
thou haſt not beene the cauſe to haue the ſin layd vnto
vs. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 14. Thou ſhalt not commit adulterie.
<hi>Leuit.</hi> 18. 20. Thou ſhalt not lye with thy neighbours

and defyleth a betrothed virgin is condemned to

There ſhall not be a whore among the daughters of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell,</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:3512:42"/>
not a whore-keeper among the ſonnes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
Our Lord Ieſus condemneth him of adulterie in the
heart, which looketh vpon a woman to luſt after her.
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> propoundeth diuers arguments againſt
whore-mongers and adulterers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.
15. 16. 18. and the 10. 8. and the 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 22. Galat.</hi> 5.
19. <hi>Epheſ. 5. 3. Coloſſ.</hi> 3. 5. and the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 3. &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi>
13. 4. Which our wiſe <hi>Vieillard</hi> will examine, then hee
will ioyne thereunto the conſiderations of the terrible
puniſhments of families defyled with ſuch ſinnes, the
fearefull judgements pronounced againſt ſenceleſſe and
obdurate conſciences, the lamentable changes and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
in the familie of <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon,</hi> and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
others ſince, the ſtrong and inuincible arguments
of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. Chapter, to this effect briefely,
that whore-mongers and adulterers are ſhutt out of the
kingdome of God. Therefore that we may haue a part
in the inheritance of the Saints, who are ſanctified and
iuſtified in the name of the Lord Ieſus, and by the ſpirit
of God, we muſt remember firſt, that our bodies are
not for whoredome, but for the Lord, and the Lord
for the bodie. Secondly, that ſeeing our bodies ſhall
riſe againe, not to ignominie and pollution, but to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and holines, it is reaſon we ſhould keepe them pure
and vnpolluted, for ſo are they members of Chriſt, and
conſequently, it ſhould be horrible ſacriledge to make
them members of a Harlot. Thirdly, that being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
vnited vnto the Lord, and made one ſpirit with
him, it is not meete in no ſort, to ioyne them to a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot,
with whom we are made one bodie. Fourthly, that
whoredome ought to be deteſted aboue all other ſinnes:
for whatſoeuer ſinne a man committeth, it is without
the bodie, but he which committeth adulterie ſinneth
againſt his owne bodie. Fiftly, that our bodies are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the holy Ghoſt, which is in vs, which wee haue
of God. Sixtly, that we are not our owne men to liue as
we liſt, for we haue bin bought &amp; redeemed by a price,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3512:42"/>
to wit, by the precious blood of Chriſt, as a Lambe
without ſpot, and without blemiſh, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh
of him. Of theſe ſtrong and forcible reaſons, S. <hi>Paul</hi>
frameth a holy exhortation to all men, eſpecially to old
wiſe men, whom it moſt concernes, who before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are bound to thinke and be mindfull of it: Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
then God in your body, and in your ſoule, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
vnto God. Let vs conclude this ſhort diſcourſe,
with the definitue ſentence of Chriſt, propounded by
S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the laſt Chapter to the Reuelation, in theſe
wordes; Bleſſed are thoſe which doe his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that they may haue their right in the true tree of
life, and may enter in thorough the gates into the citie:
But dogs, enchanters, whoormongers, &amp;c. ſhalbe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
Heere wee doe put wiſe old men in minde of the
holy exerciſe of prayer, and particularly we recommend
vnto them the ſerious and continuall meditation of the
one and fiftieth Pſalme.</p>
               <p>All that hath beene ſpoken againſt the aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſinnes, is extraordinary and vnuſuall, and it is a
thing monſtrous to ſee old men addicted vnto them, or
if ſuch old men are to be found, at laſt diſeaſes, and old
decrepit age, or ſome particular vengeances of God
doe come to quench and put out ſuch fiers of hell. But
there are ſinnes, which doe not grow old, nor dye in old
age, but commonly grow young, and reuiue againe.
Theſe ſinnes among others, are couetouſneſſe, anger, or
choler, diſtruſt, or impatience. <hi>Cicero</hi> thinketh, that
ſuch ſinnes proceed rather from mens manners, then of
old age; becauſe other ages of mans life haue their part
in them, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaid of the people of his times; That
from the inferiour to the ſuperiour, from the loweſt to
the higheſt, euery man was giuen to fordid and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
lucre and gaine. That old men appeare to bee
more ſubiect to ſuch euills, then young men, it ſeemes
to proceed of their weakneſſe, and of diſeaſes which
doe inceſſantly harrie and moleſt them, ſo that feeling
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3512:43"/>
their ſtrength to faile, feare inuades them, and pynions
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp in ſuch ſort that (as one ſaith) they are more afraid
then euer they were before, that the earth ſlides from
vnder their feet, are ſuſpicious, diſtruſtfull, and doe mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
at, and finde fault with euery thing that is ſpoken or
done. <hi>Cicero</hi> excuſeth theſe frailties and imperfections,
with this; That they imagine they are deſpiſed, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
mockt and ſcoft at; And that they doe fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
ſicke perſons, who are quite out of taſte with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
thing, and nothing can be made or done to pleaſe
or like them: But all theſe froward humors, are calmed
and tempered by the knowledge of learning and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
of vertue. Moreouer, <hi>Cicero</hi> wondereth very
much to ſee an old man couetous, for that it is a ſtrange
folly to load himſelfe with much luggage, and to maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre
and torture his minde with making prouiſion of
victualls, when hee is neere his iourneyes end, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
at home. Doe you not ſee (ſaid Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
in his 246. Sermon, <hi>De Tempore</hi>) that couetouſneſſe is
ſo much the more furiouſly kindled, and flames out in
frozen old men, when it is time for them to leaue and
reſigne vp all, and when they cannot keepe any longer
that which they haue gotten and ſcraped together? O
ſtrange folly! the neerer ſhee is to her home, the more
haſty and inſtant ſhe is to lay on heauier loades then ſhe
is able to beare. All this is well ſpoken by theſe worthy
perſons. In all other things, except in couetouſneſſe,
time doth diſcouer vnto vs more plainely what is to be
done, and how we may handle and feele the pulſe beate.
But if wee queſtion old men of the cauſe of this
boyling deſire, and <hi>Cupid</hi> of theirs, they anſwere in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
That it proceeds not of couetouſneſſe, but of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimony
and thrift, and alledge foure ſpeciall reaſons or
motiues. Firſt, that their ſtrength failing them, thay are
paſt getting and gathering, and it behooues to ſeeke and
forecaſt for helpe and ſtayes, and to prouide pillowes
and propps, whereupon to lay their old bones, and to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3512:43"/>
reſt their weake crazie age. Secondly, that their ayme,
ſcope, and drift is, by the luſtre of their wealthy poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and riches, to keepe themſelues in honour, eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and credit with thoſe, who diſdaine old age that
is ſpurr-gald with pouerty. Thirdly, that being not
able to recreate themſelues, and to walke and ride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
from this place to that, their pleaſure and delight
is to bee caſhiers at home, to looke vpon their money
bagges, and to reckon what ſtore of crownes they haue
in Banke. Fourthly, that ſo they may in better ſort pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for their children, and be bountifull and doe good
to the poore. Theſe excuſes are but pretences, and the
Apoſtle doth in few words anſwere them, in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> ſaying;
Let your conuerſation be farre from couetouſneſſe, and
be content with that which you haue, for God hath ſaid;
I will not faile thee, nor forſake thee: ſo that wee may
boldly ſay, The Lord is my helper, wherefore I will
not feare what man can doe vnto me. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> in his
Homilies, or Sermons againſt couetous perſons, doth
confute their ſeuerall allegations, whereof we will here
draw out a few lines vnto you. If, ſaith he, old age
doth put you to paine, why doe you make it more paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and tedious to you, by treading morter, and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
clay to make brickes, as heeretofore the children
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did in the time of their bondage in <hi>AEgypt?</hi> If
your ſtrength faile you, ought your charity therefore to
faile? If you ſo much loue and affect life, will you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
preferre the goods of the world before the Author
of life? will you therefore deſpiſe and not regard the
true life? Doe you deſire to be had in honour and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?
Doe you feare to be contemned and deſpiſed?
practiſe that which the Prophet ſpeaketh in the 112.
Pſalme; and that which the Apoſtle rehearſeth in the
ſecond Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Chap. 9. A good man
is charitable and lendeth: The iuſt ſhall bee had in euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
remembrance: Hee diſtributeth and giueth to the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3512:44"/>
poore and needie: His righteouſneſſe remaineth for
euer: His might, or horne ſhall bee exalted in glory.
Doe you deſire gaine or profit: Hearke what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> Chap. 6. 9. 10. Let vs not be
weary of well doing, for in due ſeaſon wee ſhall reape
if wee faint not:<note place="margin">The time to doe good is in this world, but men cannot finde it.</note> Wherefore, while wee haue time let vs
doe good to all men, but eſpecially to the houſhold of
faith. What myching couetouſneſſe is it, not to bee
willing to part with ſomewhat of that which we haue,
and to let others haue a feeling thereof, vntill wee bee
dead, to wit, when we haue nothing to doe with it our
ſelues? Will you then haue men to wiſh your death, or
as they kill fat hogges to practiſe and procure it, that
euery one afterward may haue a peece and a part?
Though you haue the gout in your feet, it may not be in
your hands, as it is, when after the example of the accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
rich man, you will giue nothing to poore begging
<hi>Lazarus.</hi> What a ſhame is it to young men, and much
more to old men, to waſte, and ſo badly ſpend and lay
out ſo much money in banquets, reuellings, maskes;
yea, in many luſts and ſhamefull pleaſures, and to ſhew
themſelues ſo pinching and niggardly in neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolences,
tending ſo many wayes to their honour,
credit, and profit? What wrong doth a rich old man to
himſelfe, to loue rather to haue his table charged withſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perflous
diſhes of meate, to haue a great retinue and
number of leud ſeruants, to take pleaſure to bee cloyed
with buffones, impoſtors, ſcorners of all religion, then
to ſhew himſelfe religious indeed? What a wofull caſe
is it, to giue leſſe in a whole yeare to a great number of
poore Chriſtians, then to ſome one deteſtable rake-hell,
who hath tenne times deſerued to haue iuſtice executed
vpon him, to be nayled to the pillory, or to be put in a
ſacke and caſtinto the ſea? Vndoubtedly couetouſnes,
eſpecially in old men, knowes no meane in ſparing or
ſpending. Sometimes ſhee is all for belly cheare and
banquettings, and as wee ſay, throwes the houſe out at
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3512:44"/>
the windowes, then ſhee is niggardly and pinching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
and like vnto <hi>Rhodomache,</hi> a wilde beaſt in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi>
which forrages vp and downe ſeeking paſture to
fill her ſelfe, and afterward ſeekes to diſgorge and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
her panch, to cramme it quickly againe fuller then
before. It is a pleaſing and fauoured excuſe among
men (ſaith <hi>Baſil</hi>) to alledge that they ſpare for their
children. But haue you begged children of God, that
hauing them, you might forget God himſelfe, and your
neighbours. How many perſons by their riches haue
waſted themſelues in pleaſures, to the wracke and ruine
of their bodies and ſoules, to whom it had beene much
better to haue ſtill beene poore? What auayles it a man
to gaine the whole world, and to loſe his ſoule? to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in periſhing riches, and not to haue one myte of
faith, charity, repentance, humility, truth, and ſtedfaſt
hope? And what of all this? you deſerue then a double
puniſhment; both becauſe you haue doated, and beene
enamoured of this yellow and white oare and earth; as
alſo becauſe your rauennous niggardſhip, and baſe pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
on the one ſide, and your monſtrous and beaſtly
prodigality and lauiſhing out on the other ſide haue bin
the inſtrumentall cauſe of the diſſolution, perdition,
and ruine of your ſucceſſors, and children. You thinke
ſometimes, if you giue order that they bee well inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the feare of the Lord, your Soueraigne, and
theirs, that they ſhall lacke nothing: If they be wicked,
the more you ſhall leaue them, the worſe they will doe.
O ſot! thou flyeſt pouerty, which indeed hath want of
ſome things, and forgetteſt that the couetous perſon
wants all things: O mad foole (ſayd Ieſus Chriſt, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the rich worldling, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 20.) this night
they will take thy ſoule from thee, and whoſe ſhall theſe
things be, which thou haſt prouided, &amp;c. And I aske of
you rich old men, and not very wiſe, who haue deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſo many families to increaſe wicked riches for your
children, whoſe ſhall you bee, and what will become of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3512:45"/>
you, when you muſt be diſlodged and turned out of the
world? redeeme your ſinnes by iuſt dealing, and your
iniquities by your beneficence and good deedes to the
poore: this ſhall prolong the proſperity and welfare of
your ſucceſſors and poſterity, which you ſo much deſire.
And this counſell heeretofore wiſe <hi>Daniel</hi> gaue to the
King of <hi>Babylon, Dan.</hi> 4. 27. Let vs ſay further with a
worldly wiſe man, That he is rich, who is content with
his pouerty; on the contrary, hee is poore, which coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
more to that which he hath, not he which hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
For what auailes it, how much money a rich man
hath in his Coffer, or mowes of corne in his barne, or
heardes and flockes of cattle in his paſtures, or crownes
at intereſt, if he caſt an enuious eye vpon that which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
man poſſeſſeth, if he reckon not vpon the goods
he hath, but vpon thoſe he would haue? Will you know
what is the meaſure of riches? The firſt is, to haue that
which is needfull; the ſecond is, to haue as much as is
enough or to ſuffice. There is nothing then better or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
nor whereof our wiſe <hi>Vieillard</hi> ought more to take
heed, then not to ſuffer himſelfe to bee bewitched and
intoxicated with the poyſon of couetouſneſſe, which it
behooueth betimes to root out of our hearts, for if it
take roote there, euery eye ſhall ſee it bring forth leaues
and fruites of all ſorts of ſinne; according as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
teacheth in the laſt Chapter, of his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy.</hi>
For concluſion of this point, we exhort the wiſe
<hi>Vieillard</hi> to remember to imitate the prayers of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
in the 119 Pſalme, and to ſay with that great Prophet;
Encline mine heart to thy teſtimonies, not to couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
O Lord, I haue thirſted after thy ſaluation, and
thy word is my delight, I loue the doctrine of thy
mouth, better then thouſands of gold and ſiluer. Wee
further preſent vnto him the prayer which followeth,
to the end hee may want nothing which appertaines to
his duty, or which he might require of vs. O Lord
God Almightie, which haſt giuen me the vſe, and lent
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3512:45"/>
mee the commodities of this preſent life; I am greatly
diſpleaſed with the too greedy affection which I beare
to tranſitory riches. Behold, this is the worſt euill of
my ouer thirſty and ouer greedy mind, which no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
can allay, no meaſure limit; for the more I poſſeſſe,
the leſſe I ceaſe to couet, the more I loſe the poſſeſſion
of my ſelfe. The greater my heapes be, the leſſer I find
them. My carking and caring is beyond meaſure, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
my reuenewes, and to heape vp goods and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
and ſtill my couetouſneſſe makes the heape
ſmall. Gaping after that which I hope, I let that which
I hold in my hand fall to the ground. All that I doe, is
a very dropſie of the minde. In hunting after plenty, I
haue found ſcarcity and want, and imagining tranſitory
things to be very profitable, I finde my ſelfe intangled
in the toyle of miſeries, out of which I cannot get.
They are precious chaines and manacles I confeſſe, but
they binde me as faſt, as if they were of iron. They are
chaines which make me forget thy holy maieſty, to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
my ſaluation, for which I ought diligently to watch
and labour: O my God, tame and ſuppreſſe this vnruly,
wilde, and ouer greedy affection, making abſtinence
and continence to ſpring vp in ſtead thereof. Eaſe the
heart in my breaſt, which panteth and gapeth for breath.
Change this denne of rapine and robbery, into a quiet
lodge and harbour of holineſſe. Waſh, and waſh againe
theſe groſſe corruptions, and giue me the bright ſhining
beames of charity. Fill and damme vp the bottomleſſe
pit of my heart, with the loue of thy grace, that the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory
goods of this world may not bee able to fill it vp
againe. Inflame my thought with the ſole deſire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the beautie of thy face, and turne it away farre
from the greedy deſire of hauing and poſſeſſing much
earth. Grant vnto me, I beſeech thee, that I may frame
my ſelfe to a voluntary pouerty; which being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
with a milde, right, lowly, and true contentation,
may continually rule and beare ſway in mee in ſuch
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3512:46"/>
ſort, that reſting my ſelfe content with a little, I may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
all the houres of my life in thy ſeruice: that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ceaſing I may meditate and thinke vpon thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
and the benefits, whereof thou haſt giuen mee ſo
large a portion. Be it farre from mee to wiſh to lay vp
heapes of ſiluer and gold and tranſitory goods, and if I
bee frugall and ſparing to lay vp any, that I may doe it
with this minde, not to lay them out wickedly in vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and diſſolute riotings, but to releeue the neede of
my brethren thy children. Can I finde any of my
goods, wherewith I may doe good vnto all men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to the houſhold of faith, let theſe be my vacancies
and exerciſes. From thence let flowe the contempt and
refuſall of all things which doe not guide mee to thee,
and to hate thoſe things which lead mee out of the
way from thee. Grant vnto my ſoule, ſo much toſſed
vp and downe in the hauen of thy mercy, to land at her
Port, that floting no longer vpon the perillous waues
of ſo many fooliſh and noyſome luſtes, ſhee may reſt in
the loue which thou haſt teſtified vnto mee in my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
<hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to ſpeake of anger and choller, which
commonly keepe poſſeſſion in old men, by reaſon that
they ſtill feele ſharpe goades in their mindes, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
woundes in their bodies, either for that their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
miſgouerne themſelues, or their wiues behaue
themſelues vſurpingly, or conſidering the common
ſtate of things, the ordinarie burthen of their ſong is,
that all the world is naught, becauſe their manner is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
highly to commend the times paſt, and euer to
bode and preſage that the times to come will bee worſe
and worſe. Beſides, old men are ſuſpitious, diſtruſtfull,
and hard of beliefe, becauſe (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth) hauing
liued long, many men haue deceiued or dealt craftily
with them, or they haue deceiued and dealt craftily with
others. They are not eaſily reconciled, for they cannot
endure to be aduiſed or directed, although (as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

ſayth) there is no age too old to learne, and that
thoſe old men, which are incorrigible, and will not be
reformed, haue more cauſe to be aſhamed, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then to ſmooth vp themſelues that they do well,
and laugh in their ſleeues at thoſe which would grauely
put them in mind of their dutie. But the principall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
of our wiſe <hi>Vieillard</hi> ſhall be to ouercome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
eſpecially in reſpect of anger, or choller, a cruell
and outragious paſſion, which <hi>Horace</hi> the Poet fitly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nameth
a ſhort madneſſe. He ſhall eaſily get the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of it, if preſently vpon the firſt motions and aſſaults
he repreſſe and repulſe it, before he be invaded, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported,
wounded, poyſoned with it. To alter na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is a very hard thing: notwithſtanding many things
in nature may be corrected and tempered by taking a
little heed thereunto; Eſpecially choller may be repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by abſtaining to drinke too much ſtrong wine, and
to feed vpon meates and ſauces too much ſpiced, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining
the company of ſcoffers, quarrell-ſome, muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
and mad-braine-ſicke perſons, by frequenting the
company of good men, by framing the minde to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
vpon the ſuffrings, patience, humilitie, ſoueraigne
charitie of Ieſus Chriſt, by the reading alſo in good
bookes, the many worthie examples of the meekeneſſe
and patience of infinite perſons ſet forth vnto vs. Now
as greene things doe helpe the ſight, and as there bee
ſome coullors which doe leſſe offend the eyes then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
ſo there be pleaſant ſtudies and delightfull exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
and imployments, which driue away dullneſſe of
ſpirit, and melancholie of minde. And becauſe choller
is ſtirred vp in vs vpon an opinion of wrong done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
vs, let vs weed out of our hearts all ſuſpitions, let vs
ſtop our eares againſt rumors and tales, and let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
in our ſelues, that often-times it hath beene better
to winke at, and paſſe by an iniurie then to reuenge it,
ſeeing that it is a woefull and impious act to be cruell to
our ſelues, which falls out, when choller doth diſturbe,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3512:47"/>
and put the mind and bodie out of all good tune, frame,
and temper: ſo that (to ſpeake truely) there is none to
whom we doe ſo great iniurie as wee doe to our ſelues.
Vndoubtedly, the wrath or anger of man doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
the righteouſneſſe of God, that is, can doe
nothing that is pleaſing and acceptable to God, as ſayth
S. <hi>Iames</hi> in his firſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>The proper effect of magnanimitie and greatneſſe of
courage, is to bridle and ſuppreſſe choller and anger,
and there is nothing ſo commendable in an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Peere and great perſon, nor worthie his fame and
reputation, as clemencie and mercie. For although ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie
muſt be vſed in puniſhing offences, yet is it meet
to curbe and ſuppreſſe anger, which alwayes leapes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the boundes of mediocritie, and driues vs into
the toyle of odious and idle fuminges and chaffings.
If wee be prouoked to anger, let vs according to the
precept of the Apoſtle, be angry and ſinne not, which
we ſhall doe, if we be angry with our ſelues, and deteſt
our owne frailties and vices. But ſo long as we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant
with men, let vs carrie our ſelues friendly and
louingly, &amp; couragiouſly ouercome the miſeries, which
are of a ſhort continuance, by reaſon that while we are
taking a ſuruay of our ſelues, ſtirring to and fro, here
and there, turning vs about, and looking how feate and
handſome we be, death following with euerlaſting life
will ſeize and lay hold on vs. But if malice and priuie
hatred doe creepe into our hearts, it is expedient to
ſeeke a ſpeedie reconciliation, for when wee ſee the
minde of man (if in this point wee beleeue <hi>Valerius
Maximus</hi>) to abandon hatred, and to be of a peaceable
and reconcilable inclination, it is a ſigne that it is in an
excellent ſtate of reſt and tranquilitie. And as calme
weather at Sea after a raging guſt of winde, and as a faire
Sun-ſhine day after a cloudie ſtorme, is wonderfully
pleaſing, ſo warre turned to peace cauſeth vnſpekeable
contentments. Moreouer, touching the things which
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3512:47"/>
ſeeme to excite and prouoke vs to anger, as the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of our children, the ingratitude of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
or friends, the perfidious and falſe dealing of
ſome others, ſickneſſe, and diſeaſes: they are the viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Lord God, to proue our patience, and alſo
to repreſſe the pride of our fleſh. Let it be our part not
to thruſt our nayles into our owne wounds, nor to add
(as we ſay) fewell to the fire, but rather let vs daily pray
to our heaunly Father, who being our ſole Creator, is
likewiſe ſoly he, who can reforme and regenerate vs,
that by the vertue and efficacie of his ſpirit, hee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
all our corrupt and inordinate affections in ſuch
ſort, that as children of God, nor of Sathan, or of <hi>Cain,</hi>
we may be cloathed with the new man created accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to God, may be couteous one towardes another,
mercifull, mutually forgiuing one another all offences,
as our Lord hath graciouſly pardoned all our ſinnes in
Ieſus Chriſt. But it is not requiſite to proceede further
in the diſcourſe of anger or choller, the turpitude and
deformitie whereof is ſufficiently knowne to wiſe old
men, who haue read the excellent Treatiſes, which
haue beene aunciently written of it, eſpecially, in the
Bookes of <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Plutarch:</hi> Afterward in our tyme
by <hi>Iohn de L'Eſpine</hi> in his graue Diſcourſes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
of the minde. Whoſoeuer will adde to theſe
that which <hi>Turtullian</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Doctors of the
Church haue written of patience, can require to know
nothing further of this ſubiect, vnleſſe he may bee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to adde that which S. <hi>Baſile</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> haue
written in diuers Homilies againſt anger, and the great
deſire of reuenge, which is to be lamented in all men,
and beyond all meaſure to bee abhorred of a wiſe old
man. As for many late writers, which in Latine, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
Almaigne, or any other Language beſides the
French, haue written of choller, or anger, and of the
helpes and remedies againſt it, which they haue called
out of Bookes of Diuinitie, naturall Philoſophie, and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3512:48"/>
Phiſicke; We need not now to make a Catalogue of
them, they making nothing to our principall intention
in this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>There remaineth to ſpeake ſomething of diffidence
and diſtruſt, the mother of impatience and almoſt of all
other vices. Our Lord correcteth this euill in thoſe
that are his, whom he calleth ſometimes men of little
faith, ſhewing the remedies for it, to bee contained in
the conſideration of the gracious power of our God.
If any men be bound to ſuch contemplation, wiſe old
men are, who ſeeing themſelues at their iourneies end,
and feeling their ſtrength to faile, ought to profit in
faith, and in the meditation of the prouidence and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of God. It is that whereunto S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemes to haue
regard, when he willeth old men, to ſober, diſcreete,
aduiſed, ſound in the faith, in charitie, and patience,
<hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 2. What is the cauſe of the frowardneſſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
in old men? Euen this, that they forget ſo
many great fauours and benefits, which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
vpon them, hauing mercifully drawne them
from their mothers belly, tenderly brought them vp,
protected them from infinite dangers, ſo that they haue
great cauſe to prayſe God at all times, as <hi>Dauid</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them by his example in diuers Pſalmes, eſpecially
in the 34. 71. and 118. Pſalmes, which all young and
old men ought to know by rote, and by heart; As alſo
we recommend vnto them the ſeuen and thirtith
Pſalme, which may be called the ſhield againſt impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
becauſe we may finde therein, that which is able
to ſettle, and aſſure a conſcience wauering and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the ſcandalls and offence, to ſee the eminent
proſperitie of Atheiſts, and prophane perſons. Put the
caſe that the skie fall, that the earth melt into the deepes,
and that the elements of fire and water be mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
ſhall we ſuffer therefore melancholie, fretting,
and impatience to deuoure vs, when on the contrarie
our Sauiour exhorts vs at that very time to lift vp our
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3512:48"/>
heads to heauen, becauſe our deliuerance drawes neere,
and is at hand? <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 28. Is there any heauineſſe
or anguiſh which the promiſed comforter, who is more
mightie then all the world may not aboliſh and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way?
Prouided we leaue the matter to him, and baniſh
and caſt of all diſtruſt and impatience. Then to what
vſe ſhould ſo many promiſes of the ſonne of God ſerue?
and what ſhould that charitable and ardent prayer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
which he made a little before his death, deſcribed
in the 17. Chapter of S. <hi>Iohn?</hi> But if wee will conſerue
and keepe our ſoules in peace, and in true ioy, let vs care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
keepe faith, and a good conſcience, and let vs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and after his example, to hope that
the reſurrection of the dead, as well of the iuſt as of the
vniuſt ſhall come, and to haue our conſcience vnblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
towardes men, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 15. 16. Thus doing wee
ſhall alwayes haue ioy in God, <hi>Phillip.</hi> 4. 4. The heart
which is glad and reioyceth in the Lord, is a perpetuall
banquet, <hi>Pro.</hi> 15. 15. So the vncleane and froward ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
the horror of ſinne, the ſenſe and feeling of the
wrath of God ſhall vaniſh and depart from vs, and wee
ſhall ſing in triumph with the Apoſtle, theſe excellent
ſayings, If God be on our ſide, who ſhall be againſt vs?
He which hath not ſpared his ſonne, but gaue him for
vs all to death, ſhall not he bountifully giue vnto vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
all things with him? I am perſwaded that neither
death, nor life, nor Angells, nor principalities, nor
powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor
height, nor depth, nor any other creature is able to ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
vs from the loue, which he hath manifeſted vnto vs
in Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30, &amp;c: If ſometimes
we feele our faith to languiſh and droope, and our ſoules
to be heauy and penſiue, let vs ſpurre and rouze vp our

Pſalme. 12. v. My ſoule why art thou caſt downe,
and why art thou diſquieted within me? waite on God,
for I will yet giue him thankes, hee is my preſent helpe,

and my God. Let vs then diſcard and caſt from vs, the
execrable ſuggeſtions of the fleſh &amp; of Sathan, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to the counſell of the Sonne of God, who doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort

               <head>CHAP. XI. Of the cauſes that old age is burthenſome, and tedious to
many old man.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Well framed minde reioyceth in proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and is ſenſible of afflictions. But the
euill and miſchiefe is, that many men ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
their eye awry vpon euils, giue good
things a ſhrewed vnhappie, and wrong
name, ſpeake ſiniſterly and ill of them, or doe not iudge
of them as they ought: Whereupon it followes that old
age is tedious, and vnpleaſing vnto them, becauſe they
haue not learned wherof to reioyce, and to complaine,
nor know not the felicities of old age, what they are,
nor haue not ſaluted or congratulated them a farre off,
nor neere hand.<note place="margin">The common felicities of old age.</note> I doe not reckon nor reſt vpon thoſe
common felicities, to haue the Hatt put off to them, to
be men of countenance and reſpect, to haue ſeruants to
attend them, to be ſought vnto for their counſell and
aduiſe, felicities which doe not happen to all old men:
But I haue a regard to the true felicities, whereof our
next Chapter ſhall treate: In ſo much, that it was wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpoken, that old age doth reſemble the Images called
<hi>Silenes,</hi> which a farre off, and without appeared to bee
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3512:49"/>
groſſely carued, and very ill fauouredly made, but neere
hand were of excellent workemanſhip, and ſeemed to
haue in them, I know not what, that was more then
humaine. Such is properly old age, if the life paſt hath
beene wiſely ordered, and if old men doe truely know
their ſtate and condition. But in mine opinion there
are foure Reaſons wherefore many old men doe impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently
beare the burthen of old age. The firſt is, that
by their fretfull impatience, they doe aggrauate their ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable
miſeries a great deale more then is fitting, or
there is cauſe, &amp; giue out in ſpeech, that they are worſe
then they be, and being too ſenſible of them, regarding
altogether the preſent paines and euils, which they feele
and ſuffer, doe not comfort themſelues with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of their felicities paſt, nor with the hope of
the felicities of come. The ſecond, is an euill education,
which is ſo preuailing, potent, and powerfull, that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
is almoſt a nature, and habit doth vtterly depraue
mens manners, and wholly corrupt them. Therefore
the ſaying of a wiſe auncient man is of a authoritie; that
it is fit betimes to trayne vp young men to take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
or paines in ſuch things wherein it is meete for
them to recreate themſelues,<note place="margin">Delightfull good recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are as fit for young per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as labour.</note> or to bee buſied, or take
paines: Euen as it is good to make them fit for honeſt
trades, or occupations, and to envre them to good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
ſeruices, and to well-doing, which no age
ought to refuſe. For if wee ſhould draw the ſhoulder
from vnder the yoke, and ſhunne all ſtudie and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie,
we ſhould make no reckoning of vertue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we doe not attaine, but by the way that is narrow,
vneaſie, and painefull to clyme; whereunto hauing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
our care is, that we be not carryed beyond our
bounds, and miſled by the vices which we hate and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyde.
It is ſayd that good houſe-keepers make vſe of
any thing, be it neuer ſo ſmall a rag; and why ſhall not
wiſe old men haue the wiſedome and skill to drawe and
diſtill good out of the euils which they ſuffer. Phiſitians
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3512:50"/>
finde infinite remedies, and wonderfull medicinall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
in plants, herbes, and fruits, which wee would
neuer thinke to haue ſuch excellent vertues, if daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
did not make it manifeſt and probat vnto vs.
Shall it then be forbidden to thoſe whom ſo many years
haue enabled to be wiſe, to extract from the time, and
from the ſundry accidents and occurrences of their life
paſt, ſome remedie and refuge againſt the miſeries which
doe aſſaile and beſiege them? All things are mutually
helpfull and ayding to the good of thoſe that loue God;
And what ought then wiſe old men to hope for and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
if betimes they haue learned ſome documents and
leſſons touching their true office and dutie? The third
cauſe of impatience is, that we who make profeſſion of
Ieſus Chriſt, and ſpeake highly of the Church, of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
of the ſeruice of God, of faith, of good workes,
and ſay there is nothing ſo true as the Goſpel, haue but
a weake faith and beliefe in the Goſpell, or in the aſſured
promiſes of him, who cannot deceiue nor be deceiued.
From this ſource and fountaine doe iſſue and flow all
thoſe euils which our fore-fathers, and we haue ſeene.
What euils doth incredulitie and hardneſſe of beliefe
in gender and beget? How often doth our Lord finde
fault with his Diſciples for it, whom hee ſawe ſo dull
and ſlow to comprehend and vnderſtand what hee
taught them? Old men doe torment and vexe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
when they feele their ſenſitiue and carnall life to
ſhorten and melt away, but as for the life eternall,
Angelicall, bleſſed, the neerer it approacheth to
them, the leſſe they apprehend and perceiue it. If
a man of honour or credite, did promiſe you this or
that, this promiſe ſhould paſſe for ready pay, and for
money told on the nayle; and a hard matter it ſhould be
to make you in the leaſt manner to thinke, that his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſhould bee to falſifie or breake his word with you.
Beholde, God doth tell you, and when you are ready to
depart out of the world, promiſeth that you ſhall liue
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3512:50"/>
for euer; and your minde wauers and floates vpon the
waues of doubt and hardneſſe of beleefe. This is, not
to know that there is a God, nor who hee is; this is, by
the ſin of incredulity grieuouſly to offend Ieſus Chriſt,
the Lord and maſter of all them which beleeue; this is,
to imagine a Chriſtian dwelling in the houſe of faith, a
man without faith, &amp; without hope. The fourth cauſe of
our impatience is, that old men know not what the oyle
of ſaluation is, the oyle of ioy, the oyle, whoſe flaming
light neuer goes out; or if they doe in ſome ſmall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
know it, they care not for it, nor haue any minde or
fancy to ſeeke it and begge it of the Lord. This oyle, is
the vnction of the holy Ghoſt, wherewith Chriſtians
being inwardly annoynted are made ſtrong, not onely
to reſiſt death, but the gates of hell alſo. The ancient
manner was to annoynt wraſtlers with oyle, and old
men which are to combate and fight againſt the terrours
of death, haue very great need of this oyle and ſpirituall
vnction. Let them take heed then that they quench not
the ſpirit. 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 19. But (to vſe another compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon)
let them bee carefull to kindle the gift of God
in them, by a daily ſupply of this oyle, crauing with a
zealous affection the increaſe thereof, as King <hi>Dauid</hi>
did with a loud voyce in the one and fiftith Pſalme; O
God, caſt me not off from thy preſence, and take not thy
holy Spirit from me; Reſtore to me the ioy of thy ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and let thy free Spirit ſuſtaine and eſtabliſh mee.
This Spirit doth renew vs, to the end wee like
Eagles, which ſoare directly aloft in the ayre to the
Sunne, might flye vp to heauen, there to ſee our ſelues
pluckt, and ſtripped of the vaine light feathers of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
couetouſneſſe, anger, impatience, diſtruſt, and
of many wordly luſts and deſires, which like lyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twigges
doe ſtay and detaine fooliſh old men, euen, as

their hearts are buryed, hauing their ſoules more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly
crooked, then their heads and ſhoulders; ſo
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3512:51"/>
that they conſume their dayes in ſighes, waylings, and
torments; being wholly vnprouided of fit remedies to
temper and ſweeten the woes and ſorrowes of this life,
nor hauing the power of themſelues to leaue and forſake
this world; but as they muſt perforce bee driuen out of
it, although miſery doth aſſayle and afflict them on

ſpeake heere of a well framed and
well ordered old age, and of that age,
which is from fiftie fiue yeeres, or
there abouts, vntill threeſcores and tenne, or foureſcore
yeares. Touching thoſe caſuall miſeries, as childiſh hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and doting manners, paulſies, faintneſſe, feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and the like infirmities either of minde or body,
theſe art not heere to be conſidered, for all old men doe
not bring forth commendable fruits and effects of their
liues; being become ſots, leud, and men altogether
rude and ill nurtured. And who would thinke to goe to
gather grapes of thornes, figges of thiſtles, and to finde
hony in a gall? Ancient men had a Prouerb (as <hi>Dauid</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 14.) That wickedneſſe doth proceed
from the wicked. But we doe maintaine, that there are
vertues not common, which are to bee found in old
men, who are vertuous, wiſe, and fearing God, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are worthy and none elſe, (as <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith) of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
name of old men, although they haue faint and
languiſhing bodies and lye bedred. Speaking then of
good, we doe conſider diuers ſorts of good. There is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:3512:51"/>
a naturall good, a politique, a ſupernaturall, and a good
which is oppoſed to that which is vitious and bad, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing,
painefull, vnprofitable, hurtfull.</p>
               <p>Wee doe take vpon vs to make it appeare, that theſe
diuers ſpecies and ſorts of good, doe all meete in old
men. And firſt, to ſpeake of the naturall good; What
thing is there ſo agreeable to nature, as ripeneſſe of
iudgement? Now this is found properly and altogether
in old men. For pregnant and forward wittes, are of
an extraordinary laſt, and doe ſeldome laſt long. Men
of ripe age, doe vndoubtedly perceiue the ouerboyling
blood and paſſions of youth, to waxe luke-warme and
to freeze in them, they feele ordinarily many ſalt
rheumes, and Catarrhes to conſume and dry vp in
them, they are macerated and leane, and they know
their iudgement decayes. It is a naturall good to dye
old, for a man to bee carefull of himſelfe and his health,
which is ſounder in old men, then in young; who, for
the moſt part, regard not the good gouernment of
their bodies and liues.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ciuill or politique good, it chiefely
conſiſteth in honour, which being the Magnificent and
Maieſticall reward of vertue, hath beene the cauſe that
wiſe old men haue alwayes iudged, that there was no
good ſo commodious as this. The <hi>Spartanes,</hi> and many
other people, did honour very much the ancients and
elders; who in the common-weale of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendents,
and had the charge of publique and State
affaires committed to them. And Saint <hi>Paul, 1. Timoth.</hi>
5. 17. willeth, That the elders that rule well bee eſteemed
worthy of double honour. All conſtitutions and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
doe decree, that old men command, and yong
men obey. The <hi>Athenians</hi> obſeruing an ancient decree
of <hi>Solon,</hi> did honour old age in ſuch ſort, that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt
men of the citie had the prime voyce, and ſpake
firſt in all their common counſells and aſſemblies, and
they eſteemed it very expedient for the good of their
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3512:52"/>
ſtate, to reſpect the counſell of old men. Young <hi>Plinie</hi>
in the eight booke of his Epiſtles writeth, that there was
an ancient conſtitution to this effect; That young men
ſhould learn of old men, not only how to behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in their ſpeeches and words, but alſo in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and geſture of body: The father was tutor to the
ſonne, and if the father dyed, the ancienteſt man of the
place where he dyed, or of ſome other place, was to
haue the tuition and wardſhip of his ſonne. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſath to <hi>Timothy</hi> his ſcholler; Rebuke not an elder,
but exhort him as a father, and the elder women as
mothers.</p>
               <p>Concerning the goods of the minde, which are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall;
as prudence, temperance, continency, and thoſe
which are ſupernaturall and infuſed; as the true wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the ſincere knowledge of God, the zealous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation
of his name, the diſcuſſion of Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
controuerſies, the dexterity, and skill of mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
and ordering Church diſcipline; there was neuer
no doubt made, but it is agreed vpon of all men, that
old men haue a larger meaſure of knowledge heerein,
and without compariſon more vnderſtanding to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
then young men. Certainely young men, who
are of ſober and diſcreet conuerſation and manners,
and plentiouſly furniſhed &amp; qualified with graue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells,
as <hi>Timothy</hi> the Euangeliſt was, doe deſerue very
great commendation and applauſe. 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4. 12. But
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth not mynce and diſſemble the matter,
but that ſuch greene heads are often time in trauell, and
whurried about with intemperate luſts and deſires; and
further, will not admit that the Paſtour and Miniſter of
the Church, ſhould be a young ſcholler, or freſh-man;
leaſt being puffed vp with pride, hee fall into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the Arch Calumniator the Diuell. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi>
3. 6. Hee forbiddeth the young widdowes to meddle in
things ſet a part for the ſeruice of the Church. 1. <hi>Timoth.</hi>
5. 12. It is euident what opinion old men in times paſt
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3512:52"/>
had of young men. <hi>Homer</hi> in his <hi>Vliſſes</hi> declares, that
young men vſually are inconſiderate and heedleſſe. <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
writeth, That they are not very capable of morall
knowledge, for lacke of iudgement and experience,
which they could not attaine vnto, but by ſucceſſion
of time. <hi>Cicero</hi> propoundeth this ſentence; That young
men are raſh and heady, and old men are aduiſed and
ſtayed. Beſides, many others haue ſhot forth the like
bolts and cenſures, whereof this is the totall ſumme
and ſubſtance.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>I neuer ſaw wiſedoms and youth, both together dwell,</l>
                  <l>Nor him a good commander, that did neuer obey well.</l>
               </q>
               <p>I will heereunto adde further this Stanza of verſes
of the ſame quill.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Suddenly to reſolue, and raſhly to beleeue all,</l>
                  <l>Not to diſcerne and friends voyce, from a flatterers call:</l>
                  <l>Young headed counſell, and new ſeruants put in truſt,</l>
                  <l>Haue oftentimes laid high eſtates in the duſt.</l>
               </q>
               <p>It is recorded in Hiſtories, that many Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales
hauing beene diſturbed turned topſie turuie, and
brought to ruine, by the bold forwardneſſe and raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of young Counſellours, haue beene reeſtabliſhed,
and at length reduced to a good forme of gouernment
by the counſell of old men. The kingdome in the houſe
of <hi>Dauid,</hi> in the time of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> the Common-weale
of <hi>Athens</hi> many times, and of <hi>Rome</hi> in the conſpiracie
of <hi>Catiline,</hi> are a proofe heereof. So then the fruits,
which old age doth yeeld and bring forth, are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,
whereof ſome redound to the glory of God, as old
men haue more deuotion and religion then other men,
their prayers are more powerfull and frequent, they
doe more vſually, and daily extoll and magnifie the
grace, fauour, &amp; prouidence of God, whereof they haue
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3512:53"/>
many teſtimonies and experiences in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
There are other fruits, which old age doth yeeld,
which doe ſerue to the benefit and good of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
for that wiſe old men by their good counſells,
doe maintaine and ſupport publique eſtates, and their
owne priuate eſtates, be they great or ſmall. For he that
is a prudent gouernour of a ſmall family, deſerues great
commendation; As on the contrary, if the followers
and ſeruants of the mightieſt, and moſt eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that may be imagined, doe liue diſſolutely, it is a
woefull ſhame: And heereof wee muſt appeale to the
iudgement of <hi>Salomon,</hi> in the fourth Chapter of his <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes,</hi>
13. v. where hee ſayth, Better is a poore and
wiſe childe, then an old and fooliſh King, that will no
more be admoniſhed. And what is a wiſe old man in a
counſell of State? It is an incomparable treaſure. And
what is a King, Prince, Lord, that is old and wiſe? It is
a true and liuely image of God among men. There are
other fruits, which old men themſelues enioy, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
diſcreetly, reſt in peace, health, and welfare, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their courſe of life within the liſts of pietie, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
where they ſpend their dayes in holy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and with ioy of heart paſſe their time, in ſeeing
<q>
                     <l>Their vertuous children in comely ſhowe,</l>
                     <l>About their table all on a rowe,</l>
                     <l>Like Oliue plants to ſtand and growe.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then they reape the ſweet and precious fruite of
their labours paſt. But to proceed, who would dare to
tearme wiſe old men idle perſons, who doe imploy
themſelues to the true and proper exerciſes of a man, to
wit, to the actions of the minde. Magnanimitie, true
fortitude, is not incloſed in the muſcles, nor in the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes,
but in the bearing and ſuſtaining of grieuances;
in leuying all our powers and forces to fight againſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience,
carnall luſts, againſt Sathan and the world. The
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:3512:53"/>
famous deedes of old men are wiſe counſells, inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
good examples,<note place="margin">Old mens actions.</note> zealous prayers, ſeruices to the
Common-weale and State, ſuccours and helpes to
friendes, protection and maintenance to orphanes and
children. <hi>Plato, Sophocles, Iſocrates,</hi> and a number of
Heathens more, who in their old age began and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
workes, which are yet extant and vſefull, were
they doting old perſons? <hi>Baſil, Nazienzen,</hi> Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi>
ſo many ancient and moderne Diuines, who
during the profound darkeneſſe of Atheiſtes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
perſons, wallowing like ſwine in all confuſions,
dyed very old men, and their tongues and pennes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
lay ſtill, but were buſie and mouing to edifie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the Chriſtian Churches: are theſe old men which
haue ſpent their time badly? So many white beardes,
which yet to this day ſerue their ſoueraigne Lord, of
whom they expect a glorious reward, are they to bee
caſt behinde the doore as vnprofitable veſſels? Is it
wiſely done of young men to reuile them in wordes,
and ſhamefully to ſpurne and tread on them? But as <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophon</hi>
ſaid, Thoſe men liue wiſely, who are carefull
more and more to reforme themſelues; and they liue
cheerefully, who euery day feele themſelues to profit in
vertue, which may be truely ſaid of wiſe old men, whoſe
hearts are lifted vp to the Lord, and who already haue
a foot in Paradiſe. Wherefore then, doe we accuſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and her impediments, as we call them, I meane old
age, and the infirmities thereof? Seeing that the milde,
and meeke conuerſation of old men is of better eſteem,
and more gracious in them; a pregnancie and dexteritie
to counſell well, is more eminent in them; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie
to ſuffer death, more aſſured and ſtedfaſt; and the
temperance to bridle and reſtraine fond fooliſh luſts
and deſires, is more potent and forcible in them.
Though their body be weake, their minde is ſtrong. A
wiſe old man is no more daunted at the approach of
death, then a labouring man, who hauing vndergone
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:3512:54"/>
the raine, heat, and cold of the day, is not grieued to
ſee the ſunne ſet, becauſe it is a ſigne of his ſurceaſe and
reſt from his labour, and of receiuing his promiſed wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
And old man fearing God, doth already feele the
pleaſures of Paradiſe, and being aſcended to the top and
pynacle of true knowledge, diſpiſeth the baſe, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
periſhing, to wit, the woefull and corrupt riches
of the world. According as old men haue beene better
or worſer trained vp, and inſtructed; according alſo to
the diuerſitie of gifts, which they haue receiued of God,
we ſee they yeeld diuers fruits and effects. It is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulitie,
impatience, vitiouſneſſe, and leudneſſe of
life, not old age, which is the cauſe that many, in ſtead
of referring themſelues, and their actions and affaires to
the prouidence of God, of learning that whatſoeuer
diſtaſters and diſcommodities doe happen vnto vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
and at home, in our bodies, in our goods, from
our ſeruants and thoſe of our family, from our friendes,
from our enemies, is a gracious chaſtiſement vnto vs of
our heauenly Father, and an exerciſe and triall of our
faith, we ſtill perceiuering in the ſincere knowledge of
him in our calling, ioyned with a good conſcience; Doe
woefully torment themſelues, childiſhly bewaile their
condition, if their proiectes and plors, deuices and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
haue not that ſpeedy ſucceſſe which they deſire:
As that great Orator <hi>Cicero,</hi> who forgetting what hee
had written in his booke of Offices, That no man can
be iuſt which feareth exile, paine, or death, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne
and in a deſperate taking a few dayes before hee
was ſlaine, cowardly exclaimes in a letter of his to <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius;</hi>
Beaſt that I am! In vaine haue I beene taken and
held for the man I am not! My old age is moſt vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
and diſaſtrous! My white haires after a miſerable
life ſtand vp fearefully ſtaring, and out of order!</p>
               <p>There remaineth for concluſion of this Chapter, to
adde vnto the felicities of old age, certaine excellent
priuiledges, which thoſe that are learned in the ciuill law
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3512:54"/>
doe attribute vnto it. I will giue you the cullings and
choyce of fiftie, or threeſcore and more, quoated by
ſundry collectors. Men that were auncient themſelues,
did beare no leſſe honour to very aged perſons, then
they did to Magiſtrates. The older a man is the more is
his iudgement eſteemed. In conſultations, and in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ambiguous and doubtfull to be decided, the aduiſe
of old men is preferred before the aduiſe of yong men.
Old men enioyed the priuiledges of noble men. Old
men are not ſued, nor ſcited to appeare in any Courts
of iuſtice, without the <hi>Pretors</hi> expreſſe permiſſion, and
licence, and particular information of the cauſe. The
auncienteſt men haue their names alwayes enrolled and
ſet downe firſt. Old men ought to haue the firſt places
and ſeates, and to ſit at the vpper end of the Table.
The auncienteſt Counſellors in the abſence of the
Preſident may appoynt and call a counſell. If there be
queſtion touching the obſeruing and keeping of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
contractes and rates, the auncienteſt men of a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie,
or company, haue the firſt voyce. It is graunted
and permitted to old men to cenſure and reforme their
neighbours. Many willing to accuſe and beare witneſſe
againſt any one, the teſtimonie of the oldeſt man is of
moſt credit. Old men are <hi>Magnificoes</hi> and noble men.
The counſells of old men are more regarded, then the
ſtrength of young men. In the common weale of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
there was an expreſſe ordinance of God, touching the
honour due to old men, which <hi>Moyſes</hi> recites in theſe
words; Riſe vp before the hoare-head, honour the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the aged man, and feare thy God, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 19. 32.
<hi>Elihu</hi> in the two and thirtieth Chapter of <hi>Iob.</hi> 6. verſe,
doth declare what reuerence was giuen in thoſe dayes
to aged perſons. And <hi>Salomon</hi> in his 16. Chapter of the
<hi>Prouerbes,</hi> ver. 31. ſayth, Old age is a crowne of glorie
when it is found in the way of righteouſneſſe. The
common-weale of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had a long time the auncienteſt
of the people to the number of threeſcore and ten to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3512:55"/>
it, men of great age and experience, who were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much reſpected, men of great authoritie, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
the whole bodie of the people, as all the holy
hiſtorie doth verefie. It is apparant, that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> the
ſonne of <hi>Salomon,</hi> for not giuing credit to the counſell
of old men, loſt almoſt his whole kingdome, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.
Young counſellors were authors of this confuſion, by
which it appeareth how wiſe <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> had
beene, in their iuſt gouernment, to haue ſtill gray hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
men about them, and attending on their perſons,
and what miſerie doth enſue to Princes, to deſpiſe and
not regard wiſe old men. The auncient Iewes had this
ſaying, that it is <hi>bonum omen,</hi> a good ſigne to ſee an old
man in a houſe. This ſaying ſeemes to bee taken from
the firſt of <hi>Samuel</hi> and ſecond Chapter, where the Lord
threatning the high Prieſt <hi>Eli,</hi> ſaith, There ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
bee an old man of thine houſe, all that deſcend of
thine houſe, ſhal dye in the flower of their age, and when
they be men growen. The ſame Iewes had a ſaying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
That thoſe countries wherein there are no old men
to be ſeene, doe deſerue to bee ouerrunne, waſted, and
ſpoyled by enemies. They haue an eye of regard, to
the ſentence pronounced in the third Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
where the Lord threatneth <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Iuda,</hi> to giue
them young men for their gouernours, and children
ſhould rule ouer them, and further ſayth, That women
are Lords ouer them. In the booke of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi>
there are many worthy wiſe ſentences and ſayings, in
the honour of old age. It ſhall ſuffice to note two or
three of them. Diſhonour not a man in his old age, for
they were as wee which are not old; they haue beene
taught of their fathers, and of them thou ſhalt learne
wiſedome, and to make an anſwere in time of need.
Chap. 8. And in the 25. Chapter he ſayth, That it is a
pleaſant thing to beholde gray headed men miniſter
iudgement, and for a man to haue his cauſe referred to
the elders, who can giue good counſell; Alſo that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3512:55"/>
is the crowne of old men, and the feare of the
Lord is their glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Zenophon</hi> reports, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> had a law
enioyning all men to be ſilent, when an Elder ſhould
ſpeake, to giue him the wall when they mett him in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſtreetes, and to ſet open and cleare the paſſage wayes
when he ſhould goe any iourney, or voyage. Yea, the
auncient <hi>Grecians,</hi> as <hi>Heſichius</hi> obſerueth, gaue titles of
Maieſtie to old men, naming them Excellencies, Kings,
Princes. In the auncient Romaine Common weale
great reuerence was done to old men, as <hi>Calliſtratus</hi>
the Lawyer witneſſeth. And the Poet <hi>Ovid</hi> in his third
Booke, treating of pride and haughtineſſe of minde, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
that the auncient Romaines did greatly reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
old age. It is wonderfull what <hi>Plutarch</hi> in diuers
places doth relate of the priuiledges of old age in the
Common weale of <hi>Sparta,</hi> which flouriſhed many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeares, ſo long as the young men gaue care and
credit to the counſell of old men. And <hi>Zenophon</hi> in a
Diſcourſe of the <hi>Grecian</hi> ſtate worthily ſayth, that <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabazus</hi>
ſtood vp to ſpeake, becauſe hee was the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt
common counſell man. Moreouer, in the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Romaine or Latine tongue, that is called <hi>Antiqué,</hi>
which is honeſt, of credit, and authoritie; And <hi>Cicero</hi>
ſayth in one place, <hi>Ne dubites quin quod honeſtius, id mihi
futurum ſit antiquius.</hi> And in another place, <hi>At ſalus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquior,

which the Apoſtle propoundeth in the 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 5.
Where he forbiddeth <hi>Timothie</hi> his ſcholler, &amp; all others
rudely to rebuke Elders: Vnleſſe (as S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayth)
they be ſcandalous, and an euill example to others. For

toying young men.</p>

Latine Poets infinite leſſons and inſtructions touching
vices and vertues. We doe read in the Hiſtories penned
by many learned heathens, of wonderfull things, which
may be called the racke, and billes of fearefull indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt Chriſtians, before the iudgement ſeate of

of the men of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> to the end to ſtrike
a terrour in the Iewes. Wherefore then ſhould we make
any ſcruple to alledge ſome teſtimonies of Heathens
touching the happie eſtate and condition of old age? It
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3512:56"/>
ſhall ſuffice to giue the wiſe <hi>Vieillard</hi> ſome taſte of them,
leauing him to remember the reſt, or to learne them in
the fore-named Authors, and in others which hee ſhall
remember. I commend vnto him the lawes of <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
eſpecially of the auncient Greeke and Romaine Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines;
Alſo the Apophthegmes and wiſe ſentences, and
particularly the whole Treatiſe of the ſame Author in
his <hi>opuſcula,</hi> intituled, Whether an old man ought to
meddle with publique affaires and negotiations. The
Dialogue of old age in <hi>Cicero</hi> is excellent. And in the
Diſcourſes of <hi>Socrates,</hi> in <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Zenophon</hi> there are
found to this purpoſe in queſtion many worthy ſayings.
<hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> in the eight booke of his Collection
of auncient memorable acts and ſayings, doth ſet forth
many notable examples of famous old men, whereof
ſome haue hitherto beene propounded by vs. It ſhall
then be enough to adde yet ſome teſtimonies drawne
and culled out of the hoard and treaſurie of <hi>Stobeus</hi> in
his hundred and ſixteenth Diſcourſe in fauour of old
age. The experience of old men can reueale and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
more wiſedome, then the trauailes, ſweating ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
tugging and ſtriuing of young men. It is true
that the hands of young men are ſtrong to execute, but
the braines of old men doe better ſeruice, and preuaile,
and performe more: For time is the father that begets
varietie of wiſedome and prudence. Loue to commune
and aduiſe with old men, and abandon the fooliſh deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and fond imaginations of young men, wherein
there is nothing appeares but vaineneſſe and fopperie.
So it is that the pleaſure of a vitious and ſinfull content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
doth not laſte long.</p>
               <p>Old age is not ſo neere the end of life, as it is neere
the threſhold of the dore which opens to an aſſured
happie life. Hee that will take vpon him the wardſhip
and tuition of ſome young man, and to haue him well
brought vp, doth commit him to a wiſe old man; euen
as to qualifie ſtrong fuming wines, we doe brewe them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3512:57"/>
with water. Old men who are free and ridd of the ſo
many euill luſtes, wherein young men doe furiouſly
plunge themſelues, become like vnto God. Alſo old
men liue and die as if they were rather aſleepe: whereas
the life and death of young men reſembles boyſtrous
tempeſtes and violent ſhip-wrackes.</p>
               <p>It will be obiected againſt whatſoeuer I can all edge in
fauour of old age, that the heathens alſo haue ſpoken ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
diſgracefully and reprochfully of it; witnes the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and ſeauenteenth diſcourſe of <hi>Stobeus,</hi> the ſcoffing
taunts and quipps both of the Greeke and Latine comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
and Satyricall Poets in their Tractates. And hee
he may goe for a witneſſe to, who compares old age to
Wine that is lowe and almoſt nothing but lees; to a
ware-houſe full of refuſe and brayded wares, whereof
there is no reckoning to bee made; to a ſanctuarie or
place of refuge, whereunto all ſortes of euilles ſeeme to
retyre as to their garriſon and hold; to an eccho, to a
ſhadow, to a vaniſhing dreame, and to the dead time of
Winter. <hi>Horace</hi> in his art of Poetrie doth penſill and
picture out an old man in this manner.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Many are the miſeries of wretched man that is old,</l>
                  <l>Either becauſe he hazards himſelfe to get money and gold;</l>
                  <l>And when he hath got it, his wretchedneſſe is ſuch,</l>
                  <l>He dares not lay out a penny, he loues it ſo much:</l>
                  <l>Or becauſe in all things he takes in hand, and goes about,</l>
                  <l>He is fearefull, vnweldie, full of ſuſpition and doubt;</l>
                  <l>He puts off the day of death, ſtill his minde doth him giue,</l>
                  <l>And he verely hopes many a day longer to liue.</l>
                  <l>He lies lusking at home, and loues to heare men relate,</l>
                  <l>All newes whatſoeuer, yea, the ſecrets of State.</l>
                  <l>He complaines of the times preſent, is penſiue and ſad,</l>
                  <l>And ſayes his fore-fathers dayes, were nothing ſo bad.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iuuenal</hi> in his tenth Satyre, deſcribeth the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of ſuch old age. But if wee heedfully conſider the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3512:57"/>
ſcoffing ſpeeches of theſe Authors, it will ſoone appeare,
that they ſpeake either of the diſeaſes of the body, or of
old age that is decrepit, worne out, quite ſpent and
done, not regarding the commodious helpes and vſes
of wiſe old men. For otherwiſe, to what dangers and
diſaſters are young men expoſed vnto? And when
ſhould wee make an end, if wee ſhould take vpon vs to
make a Catalogue of them? The Heathens haue confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that a young man was happy, not in regard of his
age, but his vertue: They haue affirmed as much of an
old man, adding further, That an old man is already
poſſeſſed of that which a young man expects and hopes
for. And what doe young men ayme at, and hope af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but to liue to a great age and to be old men? They
haue compared young men, vnto men toſſed vp and
downe to and fro with the windes and waues in the
middeſt of the Sea, and old men to paſſengers which
are neere their port and readie to caſte Anchor. Ought
we to maruaile (ſayth <hi>Cicero</hi>) if old men be ſometimes
feeble and decayed in ſtrength, ſeeing that young men
cannot be exempt and priuilledged from conſumptions,
or pynings away of the bodie? There is no infirmitie
whatſoeuer in old age, which the wiſer old men are not
prepared and armed for, and with greatneſſe of courage
and patience doe eaſily ſuſtayne and endure. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the verſes of <hi>Horace</hi> doe fitly ſort and agree, who
ſayth;
<q>
                     <l>If God to thee a time doe giue,</l>
                     <l>Wherein thou mayeſt full happie liue,</l>
                     <l>Moſt ioyfully this time embrace;</l>
                     <l>Doe not neglect too long a ſpace,</l>
                     <l>The happie houre of thy Fate,</l>
                     <l>To enioy a life more fortunate:</l>
                     <l>But to the world proclaime throughout,</l>
                     <l>Thou art a voluntarie Souldier and ſtout;</l>
                     <l>And wilt not from thy coullors flie,</l>
                     <l>But ſtand thy ground couragiouſly.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:3512:58"/>
And in another place he ſayth;
<q>
                     <l>Irkeſome it is to be annoyde,</l>
                     <l>With euill a man cannot auoide;</l>
                     <l>But that which is paſt remedie,</l>
                     <l>Man beares at laſt contentedly.</l>
                     <l>When patience hath him vnder awe,</l>
                     <l>Yeelding obedience to her law.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Put caſe then that old age hath his opponents, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults,
and be expoſed to diuers diſaſters, and miſeries,
ſo hath it alſo ſtrong and fit weapons, ſtratagemes, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectories,
and practiſed vertues to helpe at need. Old
mens mindes are ſtill entire and ſound, ſo long as they
are invred to ſtudie, and exerciſed. Though their legges
faile them, their wittes doe not, as <hi>Homer</hi> ſayth, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Neſtor</hi> ſpeaking in this manner; I will with my
Counſell and Orations excite and pricke forward the
youthes and young men: This is the trade and practiſe
of old men, who haue more wiſedome and iudgement
then others, and as <hi>Ovid</hi> affirmeth, It is time that ripens
experience: The counſell and ſawe of old men hath in
it ſomewhat, I know not what, that is pleaſing to heare,
gracefull, and of venerable regard and well liking.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Euen as we ſee the Sunne at his decline,</l>
                  <l>With golden rayes more pleaſingly to ſhine.</l>
               </q>
               <p>If <hi>Seneca</hi> the Tragedian bee heerein to be beleeued.
And it there be to bee found, fooliſh, impertinent, and
vnprofitable old men, they are no other then fountaines
without water, forreſts grubd vp and gladed, trees with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fruit, ſtarres without light, and all their imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and defects proceed from ill education. Remember
(ſaith <hi>Cicero</hi>) that I commend that old age, which hath
had early good beginnings, and beene well taught and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3512:58"/>
trayned vp from childhood and youth. For that old
age is miſerable, that can plead nothing elſe for Atiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but the wrinckles of the face and the white haires.
Moreouer, the more old age ſees the time to approach
of appearing before the tribunall of the Soueraigne
Iudge, the leſſe it apprehends and reckons of death, the
threatnings and rage of Tyrants: As <hi>Solon,</hi> who being
demanded, By what vertue, hee did ſo braue the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>Piſiſtratus,</hi> anſwered, His old age. Touching the
contempt of death, and a reſolution couragiouſly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
and embrace it; who will not maruell to heare
the wordes, which the great <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi>
vttered to his ſonnes a little before his death? My
dearely beloued ſonnes, ſaid he, when you ſhall ſee mee
no more; thinke not therefore I am quite annihilated
and no where: for when I was in your company you
could not perceiue my ſoule, but onely diſcuſled it in
your minde to be in my body, by the deedes and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
you ſaw me to doe. Beleeue then, that the ſoule is
ſtill aliue, and in being, although you ſee my body no
more. Neuer could any man perſwade mee, that the
ſoules of mortall men periſh with their bodies, nor that
being departed out of our bodies paſt feeling and ſenſe,
that they are without feeling and ſenſe: on the contrary,
ſeeing that the ſoul being at liberty, and hauing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to doe with the body, begins to become pure and
wholy to ſee and behold it ſelfe, I hold and maintaine,
that then it is in full perfection of knowledge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.
Furthermore, the caſe ſtanding thus, that
death is the diſſolution of nature, wee ſee whither all
things tend, to wit, to their firſt matter whereof they
were made, the ſoule excepted, which we ſee not how it
comes into the body, remaines there, nor goes out. You
ſee that there is nothing ſo much reſembles death, as
ſleepe. But the ſoules of thoſe which ſleepe, ſhew their
diuine nature in this point, that being free from diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
and at reſt, ſee and behold things a farre off, and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3512:59"/>
to come, which plainely declares what they muſt bee,
after they are deliuered from the priſon of the body.
This being ſo, reuerence mee, my ſonnes, as a thing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine;
but if the ſoule be to periſh with the body, yet giue
not you ouer to feare the gods, which maintaine, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
&amp; gouerne this Principall, &amp; maſter peece, called
Man: And in this doing, as good children, you ſhall
inuiolably preſerue my name. To this Oration, which
is bettered by <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Dialogue of old age, reciting
<hi>Socrates,</hi> who in priſon wiſely and ſtoutly diſcourſeth of
the immortality of the ſoule: Old <hi>Cato</hi> alſo addeth,
that ſeeing the ſoules of men are ſo prompt and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſiue
to remember things paſt, and of ſo wiſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight
in things future and to come, haue inuented ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
trades, arts, ſciences, ſo many rare and notable
things; It is impoſſible that ſuch natures, capable of ſo
great excellencies ſhould bee mortall. And ſeeing the
ſoule is in continuall agitation and motion, which ſhee
originally hath not (to wit, from any extrinſecall cauſe,
and from other then her Creatour, which <hi>Cicero</hi>
forgetteth) ſeeing ſhee mooues and ſtirres of her ſelfe;
it followes that ſhee ſhall euer haue ſuch agitation and
motion, for ſhee will neuer leaue or abandon to bee her
ſelfe. Further, that the ſoule in it owne nature, being a
ſubſtance ſimple, pure, vnmixt, hauing no diſagreeing
qualities, cannot be diuided, and being indiuiduall, it
followes it is immortall; which ſerues to prooue that
men are capable and of vnderſtanding before they bee
borne; ſeeing that children in learning the baſer, and
more ſeruile and meaner trades, arts, and ſciences, doe
on a ſuddaine comprehend and conceiue infinit things,
ere on would ſay, they begin to apprehend and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
what this or that is, but onely their memories
ſerue them to retaine and beare them away. <hi>Cato</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
affirmeth further, That if the ſoules of men were
not immortall, good men would not deſire or aſpire
to a glory, which is durable and ay-laſting. What meanes
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3512:59"/>
this ſaying, That euery wiſe man dieth moſt willingly,
and the wicked depart hence full fore againſt their will,
and with much griefe and vexation of minde? Seemes
it not, vnto you, that the ſoule which ſees more cleerely
and father off knowes ſhe goes to a better place? On the
contrary, hebere, dull, and ſenceleſſe man is vncapable
and ignorant heereof. Verily, I deſire nothing more
then to ſee your forefathers, whom I haue made much
on, reſpected and honoured; and beſides, I deſire to
be with thoſe of whom I haue heard men to ſpeake and
diſcourſe, whoſe bookes I haue ſeene and peruſed, and
whoſe names I haue quoated and mentioned in mine
owne writings. Now that I am onward in my way, and
making haſt to goe to them, It would be a troubleſome
and hard matter to hale mee or make mee roule, or goe
backe, as men would a ball or a bowle. And if God had
made me a grant to become a childe againe, and to cry
in a cradle, I ſhould ſtifly and with might and maine
refuſe ſuch an offer; for ſeeing, I haue almoſt finiſhed
my courſe, I will not bee recalled from my laſt end, to
my firſt ſtate and condition. Is there any commoditie
in this life? Is not this life painefull in all her reuoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
terminations, periods and endes? But put the caſe
this life hath many commodities: ſo it is that wee may
be full gorged ſatiated, and glutted with them, and ſee
and end of them too. I will not for all that way wardly
and teſtily fret, fume, ſtorme, and chaffe at this life, as
many learned men haue oftentimes done, and I repent
me not that I haue liued, for I haue ſo ſpent my dayes,
that I account of my ſelfe, as one that hath ſerued for
ſome vſe, and for ſomething in the world. I goe out of
this life, as out of an Inne, and not as one out of a houſe;
ſeeing that nature leaues vs here in this world, a time to
paſſe and walke vp and downe, but not heere to ſettle,
abide, and continue. O happy the day, when I ſhall
goe to the holy company of bleſſed ſoules, and ſhall
leaue the baſe rabble, and raſcally route of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:3512:60"/>
See heere for certaine the worthy Treatiſes, of men
ignorant of the immortality of mans ſoule, but as they
did gropingly and blindely imagine. Notwithſtanding,
they were grounded vpon this imagination, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
being ſo common, nor of more price and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with man, then the loue and preſeruation of
himſelfe, a care and regard ought eſpecially to bee had
of that part, which properly may be called Man, to wit,
the ſoule, and that the way and meanes to liue well and
happily, conſiſteth in the knowledge and comtemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of things diuine, inciting and prouoking vs to good
workes: ſo as the tranquility of our mindes conſiſteth,
not properly in being freed from paine and griefe,
but rather in being deliuered from thoſe raging and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
paſſions, which hurry the wicked vp and downe.
For as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth in his booke, <hi>De Prouidentia,</hi> thoſe
caſuall miſeries, which our owne hands bring not vpon
vs, are ſent for our good, that our many vertues may
the more gloriouſly ſhew and appeare, and that as wee
cut Vines to make them yeeld the more fruit; ſo by the
ſmart and wound of afflictions, wee are made the more
fit for laudable actions. And as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth in his booke
of <hi>Tuſculane</hi> queſtions, If at the exerciſe of wraſtling, the
champions contemne bruiſes and hurts, and their paines
and tuggings in the preſence of noble perſonages are
eaſily borne, ſet light by, and not a whit blencht at, why
ſhould we make any difficulty, ſtoutly to thwarte and
reſiſt the dangers which in the wayes of vertue offer
themſelues? What magnanimitie can be of more fame
and note, then that which is ſeene in the hazard of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and in bearing thoſe euills, which muſt be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,
and cannot be auoided; for ſo long as the heart
keepes his hold, vnmoued, vndaunted, not fainting, not
quayling, all is well. And this reſolution is much more
excellent then the poſſeſſion of the treaſures and goods
of the world, which a great minde commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnes,
as things flitting, tranſitory, and vaine. Againe,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3512:60"/>
by the teſtimony of <hi>Seneca,</hi> vnintermitted and daily
aduerſitie and euill (at leaſt as we call it) hath this good
and commodity, that thoſe that are tempeſted, vexed,
and exerciſed therewith, are the more hardy to beare
and endure. But why ſhould hee which knowes, and
takes himſelfe to be a man, and triumphes and glories
to be called a man, refuſe to put vnder his ſhoulder and
ſtoope to thoſe ieopardies, burthens, and croſſes, which
are incident and caſuall to a man.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Heathens doe tell vs of other ſtayes
and helpes to old age, whereby to prolong it, and
make it more eaſefull as well in regard of the body, as
of the minde. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth, We muſt make head, and
ſtriue againſt old age, carefully correct, helpe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
her defaults and defects, and neither more nor
leſſe reſiſt it, then wee would doe ſome diſeaſe. Let vs
haue then a care of our health, let our bodily exerciſes
be moderate, let vs eat and drinke to reſtore, and not
to oppreſſe and ouerthrow that bodily ſtrength which
remaines. Hee that is old cannot be young againe, and
death is ineuitable: but it is poſſible to corroborate and
ſtrengthen old age by good gouernment and order of
diet, and to keepe the heart from fainting and dying on
a ſuddaine. Wiſe old men are taught and preſcribed
of learned, and Chriſtian Phyſicians, reamedies out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and inward of good and ſound health, which
they are carefull to obſerue, that ſo they might hold out
and continue the longer, to doe good in the ſight of
God, to themſelues, and their neighbours: For which
cauſe, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, beſides the tendring and cheriſhing
of their weake bodies, which daily doe languiſh and
pine away, they are much more thoughtfull of their
minde, and intellectuall and memoratiue parts, which
by little and little decay, if we doe not, euen as a Lampe
is with oyle, maintaine and keepe them exerciſed. Long
trauell, tyrings, and toylefull labours make our bodies
vnweldy, ſluggiſh, and lither: on the contrary, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3512:61"/>
exerciſe and ſtudy doe recreate, reuiue, and cheriſh
our mindes. If old men be ſcoffed and mockt at in the
Theaters and common aſſemblies, as dolts mad fooles,
and dotardes, it is onely meant of ſuch as be credulous,
obliuious, voluptuous, and diſſolute perſons. Theſe are
vices of young and old, but not of all perſons alike. For
the wiſe <hi>Vieillard</hi> hath alwayes his minde bent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
vnto vertue: All his deſire is to keepe himſelfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate
and pure before God, well affectioned to his
countrey, carefull for the building of that ſpirituall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which is called the Church, gouerning and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vp his family in the loue of pietie, righteouſneſſe,
holineſſe, verity: ſhining by his graue counſells and
ſayings, and by his worthy actions and deedes, as a ſun
among men, to the ioy of his friendes and well willers,
and to the aſtoniſhment at home and abroad, of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
and enuiers of the ſplendour, and eminency of
thoſe excellent gifts, which the holy Ghoſt hath liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
communicated and conferred vnto him. The wiſe
<hi>Vieillard</hi> deſirous to liue long in this eſtate, for the good
of many, hath moſt noble and worthy thoughts, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
to his age: though hee bee farre ſpent with
yeares, his heart is ſtrong to doe wonderfull matters ere
hee depart hence, and yet the beſt of his life is in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt
part, the ſoule. But I know not what falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or wretched ignorance of the truth doth poſſeſſe
vs, that in ſtead of taking pleaſure in our owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
we ceaſe not to torment &amp; vex our ſelues about
euills, which wee make much greater then they are, ſo
that almoſt ordinarily, and without much thinking
thereon, wee voluntarily runne our ſelues headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
voluntary carkings and fits, and into continuall
anxieties, diſquiets, and troubles of minde, making that
part of our life extreamely miſerable, which ſhould with
glory crowne all that is paſt: No whit remembring, what

doubts and hard queſtions, which humane wiſedome

minde, that the ancient Authors are to bee read, which,
in his opinion are the neerer ſtreames to the fountaine

guide vs to a happy life.</p>
               <p>But wee are no ſooner borne, but behold, wee are
plunged into all corruption, and into a gulfe of errors,
and aberrations, which wee ſeeme to ſucke with the
milke of our Nurſes. Then are we afterward put forth
to maiſters and tutors, which ſtaine and corrupt vs with
ſo many falſe and monſtrous opinions, that veritie giues
way and place to vanitie, and nature being preoccupied
and foreſtalled with ſtrange imaginations, ſuffers it ſelfe
by them to be out of meaſure tranſported and lead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wry.
As then we draw out of the fountaines of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
that is, out of the word of God, conteined in the holy
Books of the Prophets and Apoſtles, moſt certaine and
aſſured documents and doctrines of the nature and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3512:62"/>
of God, of his prouidence, of his loue towards vs,
of the ſoueraigne good, and of a happie and euerlaſting
life: So wiſe old men, and all good Chriſtians, nurtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and inſtructed in the wordes of truth, of faith, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
hope, temperance, pietie, are not daunted and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
with humaine brittleneſſe and frailtie, neyther
thinke their maladies incurable, nor their paines, and
ſorrowes vnſupportable, but by the helpe of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
recorded in this holy Schoole doe enioy a ſtedfaſt
and aſſured conſolation, and doe ſay with <hi>Dauid</hi> in the
Pſalme 94. O how happie is the man O Lord, whom
thou reproueſt, and inſtructeſt by thy law, to ſet him
in a ſure habitation and refuge in the dayes of aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that while and as often as ſharpe, heauie, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
thoughts and perplexities of mind doe wound and
peirce their ſoules, they may euer be cured, holped and
cheared with heauenly conſolations.</p>
               <p>But when we ſee many old men which call themſelues
Chriſtians, more faint-hearted, more effeminate, more
impatient and froward, then many poore ſilly, miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,
and infidells haue beene: And Chriſtians likewiſe
which make ſo great a ſound of their name, and haue
high ſwelling words in their mouthes, and baſe and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
manners, who thinke one thing, and ſay and doe
another, are farre indeed from the ſtayedneſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie
of the auncient Stoickes: We can doe no other

                  </gap>neantes, vaine &amp; vitious perſons,
who like bad ſtubborne ſouldiers, when tryall and need
is, throw downe their weapons, ſcoffe and mocke at
the exhortations and incouragements giuen them to
learne to handle and weild their ſpirituall weapons in
the hall of Fence, which ſtandes open for them in the
Manſion houſe of truth: briefely, pleaſe themſelues in
abiuring and renouncing all parts and poynts of any
good and laudable dutie and ſeruice in the army of the
liuing God. Verily, the life of a Chriſtian, ſo long as he
ſoiourneth here in earth, is affronted with carkings and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3512:63"/>
carings, annoyances, and tedious diſquiets: It is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
warre, wherein we are daily to cope, grapſe, and
ſtriue againſt the enemie, as well within as without, to
wit, Sathan, the world, and our owne corrupt nature:
There, is much worke markt and cut out. But as the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings
of Chriſt abound in vs, ſo our conſolation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth
thorough Chriſt. Vndoubtedly, a Chriſtian
hath an Arſenall or Armory repleate with whatſoeuer
is neceſſary for him, wherein he findeth all manner of
weapons, wherewith God himſelfe from heauen doth
array and furniſh him, ſo long as he will lift vp his eyes
toward the promiſe and aſſiſtance of his Lord, &amp; turne
away his ſight from whatſoeuer may hinder, lett, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapp,
and intangle him.</p>
               <p>That theſe weapons are ſtrong, ſure, and of proofe,
not fained, and vaine, wee learne of two moſt braue
Warriours, who long agoe, and a long tyme to, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred
perils and dangers, were in many skirmiſhes,
and battailes, wherein they fought valiantly: Men who
for their magnanimitie, valour, &amp; long experience, hold
the prime and chiefe places of honour and rancke in the
Armie of the ſupreame and ſoueraigne chiefetaine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
and head of the militant Church, which is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt. One of them is called <hi>Dauid</hi> the <hi>Bethlemite,</hi>
the other <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Tarſus. Dauid</hi> ſinges in the Pſalme 39.
Euery man at his beſt is vanitie; doubtleſſe man walketh
in a ſhadowe: and now Lord what haue I waited for?
my hope is euen in thee: harken vnto my requeſt bow
downe thine eare vnto my cry, bee not deafe at my
teares; for I am a ſtranger with thee, and a ſoiourner as
all my Fathers were. In the Pſalme 40. Bleſſed is the
man that maketh the Lord his truſt, and regardeth not
the proud, nor ſuch as turne a ſide to lies. O Lord my
God, thou haſt made thy wonderfull workes, and none
can count in order to thee thy thoughts toward vs they
are ſo many; will I take vpon me to declare and ſpeake
of them? they are moe, then I can recount and expreſſe.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3512:63"/>
Then at the end he addeth, Let all them which ſeeke
thee reioyce and be glad in thee, and let all them that
loue the ſaluation thou giueſt to thoſe that are thine,
ſay alwayes, the Lord be prayſed and magnified. Verely
I am poore and needie, but the Lord thinkes and hath
care on me: my God thou art my helpe and deliuerer.
The ſame great warriour ſinges in the Pſalme 46. in the
name of all the Church; God is my fortreſſe, ſtrength,
and ſuccour in troubles and diſtreſſe, very readie to bee
found, therefore wee will not feare, though the Earth
tremble, and be moued, and the Mountaines fall, and be
ouer whelmed in the middeſt of the Sea. Let vs heare the
Apoſtle of the Gentiles. Although, ſaith he, we be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deliuered ouer to death for Ieſus ſake, yet wee haue the
ſpirit of faith, which preſerues vs that wee periſh not.
But although our outward man periſh, yet the inward
man is daily quickened and renewed. For our light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
which is but for a moment, cauſeth vnto vs a
farre more excellent and eternall weight of glory, while
we looke not on the things which are ſeene, for the
things which are ſeene are temporall, but the things
which are not ſeene are eternall. In another place, to
wit, in the ſixt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
he leadeth his ſouldiers into the ſpirituall Arſenall and
Armourie, and ſayth vnto them; Finally, my bretheren
be valiant, and ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of
his might: Put on the whole Armour of God, that yee
may be able to ouercome, and ſtand againſt the ſlights,
and aſſaults of the Deuill, and hauing ouercome all
things ſtand faſt. Stand faſt then hauing your loynes
girded about with veritie, hauing on the breſt-plate of
righteouſneſſe, and your feete ſhod with the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of peace: Aboue all laying hold on the ſhield of
faith, wherewith you may quench all the fierie darts of
the wicked one: Take alſo the helmet of ſaluation, and
the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the Word of God:
Praying alwayes with all manner of prayer and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3512:64"/>
in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with all
perſeuerance. Theſe are the words of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it is not enough to name and ſhew wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
to a man, if he know not how rightly to vſe and
to handle them: We are more particularly to enquire
after, and to diſcourſe and ſet forth the practiſe of this
military Art, as much as the conſolation which we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to propoſe to wiſe old men doth require. Saint
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his commentary vpon the ſixt Chapter to
the <hi>Epheſians</hi> ſpeakes well to the purpoſe; that although
the Apoſtle names many ſpecialties and partes of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
yet faith it is that makes vs keepe to our tackling
and to ſtand faſt, and whereof principally we haue need
in this ſpirituall combat. In deed what auailes it to read
much, to heare many Sermons of the prouidence, grace
and mercy of God, if faith be not added to his Word?
And what auailes it to beleeue this word to be true, if
you tremble not when it ſoundes lowder in your eares
then vſually it hath done, if you ſtedfaſtly ſettle not
your ioy and aſſurance in the promiſes of ſaluation
which it propoundeth vnto you, if you doe not in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie
revere and honour your heauenly Father, if you
dread not his wrath &amp; indignation more then ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
deathes, if you bee not wholly reſolued that God
ſpeakes to condemne you, if you perſeuere and goe on
to prouoke him, and to offer you grace if you amend
your liues and beleeue in the Goſpell. To what purpoſe
ſerue ſo many Sermons touching Ieſus Chriſt, his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
his merit, his miracles, his loue to ſaue his elect?
And what are ſo many exhortations good for, if this
Sauiour dwell not in your hearts by faith, if he doe not
rule, amend, and reforme them, if by his ſpirit of ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
and adoption, he ſeale them not vp in them, if
he doe not ſtampe and engraue his loue and truth in
them? The Apoſtle S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaking of the ſpeciall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of God, who is Almighty, and good to his children,
wiſely and neceſſarily ioynes theſe two together: To
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3512:64"/>
wit, that he hath giuen vs eternall life, that this life is in
his Sonne, ſo that whoſoeuer hath the Sonne conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
hath an aſſured guard of defence againſt death,
and all the temptations, which goe before and precede
it. Afterward that God hath giuen vs knowledge and
vnderſtanding, to the end we may know him, and be
certainely aſſured, that hee herein is true, in this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all good, which is Chriſt. The ſame Apoſtle
doth vpon good right call this aſſurance our victorie,
that is our warlike furniture and armour, wherewith we
ouercome the world, and throw downe to the ground
all her ſtrong holdes.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe, according to the example of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
wee ought deuoutly to pray to God to giue vs
faith, and daily to increaſe it in our hearts. What
daſtardes and cowardes were the Diſciples of our
Lord? What a hard, harſh, diffuſed noyſe was it, and
not to be endured, to heare of their Maiſters death,
before the vertue and efficacie of a liuely faith did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
and enlarge it ſelfe in them? Wee may ſee what
the Euangeliſtes ſayde of them. Saint <hi>Matthewe</hi>
Chapter 16. verſe 23. Saint <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 34. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi>
16. 6.</p>
               <p>The eleauenth Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi>
contaynes a great number of worthie examples,
by which we may learne how great the efficacie and
power of a true and liuely faith is in all manner of
afflictions. Wee reade the ſame in the auncient and
moderne Hiſtorie of the Church, where wee ſee a
great number of men, and women of diuerſe and
differing Ages, of young boyes and girles, that
made proofe of an inuincible Faith, as well in the
fierie Furnace of perſecutions, as in the deepe dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
and priſon of all ſortes of troubles and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and had the victorie, and now are crowned
with prayſe and immortall glorie in the Pallace of
GOD in his triumphant Church. So wee muſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3512:65"/>
conclude with the Prophet in the Pſalme 73. that God
is good to <hi>Iſraell,</hi> yea, to all thoſe, which ſerue him in
holineſſe and righteouſneſſe all the dayes of their life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
on the contrary, the fleſh, the world, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
doe grumble, gnaſh their teeth, and ſnarle at it.
And in another place (Pſalme 66.) the Prophet ſayth,
O inhabitants of the earth, bleſſe our God, and ſound
aloud his prayſe: It is he that hath reeſtabliſhed our ſoule
in life, and hath not ſuffered our feete to ſlip. For thou
O God haſt prooued vs, thou haſt tryed and purified
vs, as ſiluer is tryed and purified. As if he did ſay, iuſtly
thou mighteſt conſume vs, and thou art content to try
vs, cleanſing vs from the filth of ſo many ſcand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lls and
imputations wherewith we haue beene diſgraced and
diffamed. Wee are fallen into the fire of afflictions,
which ſhould burne and waſte vs to nothing, and are vp
to the eares in the water of extreame anguiſh, and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of bodie and minde, where if we had our deſerts we
ſhould be ſtifled, and ſtrangled, but thou haſt enlarged
and ſet vs at eaſe: The peace and holy libertie which
we enioy by thy free gift, is as a Manſion or dwelling
in a large pleaſant country to all thoſe that deſire to liue
and without ceaſing to prayſe thee. Behold how faith
doth accommodate it ſelfe, is willing and readie, ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and mitigating all the paines. griefes, and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of this preſent life, quenching alſo all the fierie
dartes of Sathan, eſpecially, deſpaire and diſtruſt. It is
ſhee which hath the cuſtodie and charge of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of God, which ſhrowdes vs vnder the helmet of
ſaluation, with the ſtrong ſhield of affiance, hath the
ſword of the word of truth in her hand, is well ſhod
with the preparation of the Goſpell of peace, doth croſſe
and reſiſt all impediments and letts, and beſtirres her
ſelfe on euery ſide in the enemies campe. If then (as S.
<hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayth, writing to thoſe of <hi>Thibara</hi>) men practiſe
and learne to fence, and to fight pell mell, not ſparing
life nor lymme, making great reckoning of a corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Crowne, which is ſet vpon their heads in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Emperour, how much more excellent and
glorious is the combat, whereof God is the Emperour
and ſoueraigne, and his Angels are not onely ſpectators,
but moderators and Iudges, and propound to vs a
Crowne of glorie? Let vs then arme our ſelues, ſayth
he, with a ſimple and pure vnderſtanding, a ſound and
ſincere faith, and with a deuout zeale and courage.</p>
               <p>But let vs yet come neerer, and according to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
and purpoſe, let vs ſee what helpe and comfort
Philoſophie, and faith doe yeeld and afford vs againſt
our naturall frailtie. While we are in this world wee
cannot haue freedome and eaſe from all our affections,
perturbations, and paſſions, nor from all ſenſe of our
miſerie. Then ſeeing it is ſo, let vs at leaſt take a courſe
to moderate them, and with patience to beare our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
which we ſhall eaſily doe, if we call to minde,
what our ſinnes doe deſerue; and how great the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and goodneſſe of God is, in turning our aduerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and troubles to be profitable and wholeſome medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines
and helpes vnto vs. Let vs then firſt acknowledge
in our originall and naturall frailtie, that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
and to be obſerued in all the children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayth in one of his Sermons vpon the
Canticles; Man being aduanced and raiſed to honour,
is become as a brute Beaſt: he dwelt in a garden, and
had a pleaſant dwelling, and very delightfull, was not
preſſed with any care or annoyances, wanted nothing,
was ſurrounded with ſweet ſmelling flowers, with fruits
pleaſing to the taſte, was crowned with glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
was ſuperviſor and Lord ouer all the workes,
which his Creator had made. But his chiefeſt excellency
conſiſted in this, that he was created after the Image of
God, was a companion with the Angelles, and with all
the companies of the hoſte of Heauen; But hee hath
changed this glorie, and is become like to the Beaſtes.
O lamentable and woefull change! That man a trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3512:66"/>
of a garden of pleaſure, Lord of the earth, a cittizen
of Heauen, a domeſtique of the Lord God of hoſtes,
an heire of heauenly happineſſe, by a ſuddaine change
is become naked, miſerable, poore, like to the beaſtes,
which with a bridle we awe and keepe vnder! Now, as
man is come naked out of his mothers belly, ſo ſhall hee
returne to the earth, carrying nothing with him of all
his labour and trauayle. For to draw ſome comfort
from that which hath beene ſpoken, let vs now and
then ponder and weigh with our ſelues, that it is our
fault and miſdoinges hath brought theſe euils and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and others much more grieuous and heauie vpon
vs, that we muſt not blame God, but our owne diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
Then let vs conſider in God ſuch a mercie, as
doth eaſily ſwallow vp all the miſeries of this preſent
life, in as much as he turneth and changeth them to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
profitable to vs. To which purpoſe S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
ſaid vpon the expoſition of the Pſalme 22. Man knows
that God is a Phiſitian, that affliction is a remedie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
his ſaluation, and not a puniſhment effectuating
his damnation. When a remedie is ſought for, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
brings a ſearing iron and fire; thou cryeſt, thy
Phiſitian heares well enough thy roarings and clamours,
but he heares not to doe as thou wouldeſt haue him to
doe, but to heale thee. Behold, according to S. <hi>Paul</hi> in
the fift Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> how the
Phiſicke workes; Tribulation brings forth patience,
and patience experience, and experience hope. Let vs
then haue before our eyes this molehill of earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the bodie is kneaded and made, and the grace of the
holy Ghoſt proceeding out of the moſt hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of Gods loue, whoſe will it hath bin that this vile
maſſe of earth ſhould bee a veſſell of his glory: Let vs
make reckoning of it, in as much as our bodies (ſo ſayth
the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>) haue beene made members of Ieſus
Chriſt, &amp; temples of the holy Ghoſt. Let vs not be leſſe
conſiderate and ingrate then the incredulous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3512:66"/>
Gentiles, who haue ſo deepely conſidered the
frailtie, viletie, miſerie of our originall, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> in
the ſecond booke of his Inſtitutions, Chap. 12. collects
out of the firſt booke of <hi>Ciceroes</hi> lawes, that they haue
acknowledged that this wretched poore liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in whom is ſeene ſuch wiſedome, prudence, wit,
memory, a large and deepe vnderſtanding and reaſon,
was created of the high God, to be eleuated and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to an excellent ſtate and condition.</p>
               <p>Although then other liuing creatures, devoid of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſeeme better prouided and armed touching the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
then man: Some being very ſwift of foote, as
Hares, Does, and Stagges: others armed with ſharpe
clawes and hornes, as Lyons and Bulles: others dight,
trimmed and ſheltered with feathers and wings, as
Birds and Fowles: yet notwithſtanding, this is done
by the exquiſite prouidence of God, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>
notes well, That all the power and ſtrength of man,
ſhould be in the ſoule, and that man ſhould be ſo much
the more ſtrong in God, as he is more weake and naked
without. This myſtery and ſecret long agoe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by <hi>Dauid,</hi> and all wiſe old men to teach
the younger, ought to remember it. Thou haſt, ſayth
he (ſpeaking to God) put thy ſtrength in the mouth of
little children, and ſucking babes. Surely in this firſt
age, ſuſtained, gouerned, guarded, and protected by a
ſpeciall wiſedome, and admirable power of the Creator,
he ſeemes to lay, as the firſt foundations of his power
and might, to make them manifeſt to them that haue
any vnderſtanding, thereby to quell and confound with
ſhame the enemies of his name, Atheiſts, and prophane
perſons, which dare conteſt and contend againſt him.
In the Pſalme 22. the Prophet ſtrengthened by his
owne experience, ſayth aſſuredly, O God, thou art hee
which dreweſt me out of my mothers belly, thou gaueſt
me aſſurance and ſafetie at my nurſes breſt; I haue been
in thy cuſtodie, tuition, and charge from the wombe,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3512:67"/>
thou art my ſtrong God from my conception. And in
the Pſalme 139. Thou haſt poſſeſſed my reines from the
time that I was lapped vp, and couered in my mothers
wombe, I will celebrate and prayſe thee, for that I was
made in ſo ſtrange and wonderfull a manner: Thy
workes are wonderfull, and my ſoule knowes it right
well: The good proportion and ſetting in order of my
bones, was not hid from thee, when I was made in a
ſecret place, and curiouſly faſhioned beneath in the
earth. Thine eyes did ſee me when I was as a formeleſſe
embryon, &amp; all theſe things were written in thy booke
before they were. O mighty God, how precious then
vnto me are the conſiderations of thy workes, and how
great is the number of them: will I take vpon mee to
count them? they are more in number then the ſmalleſt
ſands. Theſe are the holy meditations of <hi>Dauid.</hi> So
then, caſting our eyes to the ground, vpon this little
heape of earth, whereof our bodies are formed, wee
learne to hang downe the head, and bowe downe the
creſt, and to abate more then three parts of our pride
and ſelfe conceit: On the contrary, lifting vp our eyes
to heauen, from whence our ſoules tooke their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and where the great Father of ſpirits dwelles, we
haue cauſe giuen vs to reioyce, and occaſion, with all
alacritie and readineſſe, to trample vnder our feete all
thoſe earthly and tranſitory things, which nature it ſelfe
teacheth vs to diſpiſe: And an inſtruction alſo to lodge
and harbour our meditations and thoughts in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of infinite glory, wherein wee are aſſured, that all
thoſe that are righteous and ſanctified to God, by Ieſus
Chriſt, ſhall bee aſſembled to bleſſe and prayſe him for
euer. If on our birth day, wee are extruded and come
forth into the world crying and weeping; Let vs alſo
remember, that preſently we receiue the viſible ſigne in
Baptiſme of our admittance into the Church, and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the liuing God, that wee put on Ieſus Chriſt,
that wee are conſecrated to God, that wee receiue the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3512:67"/>
Hoſtage, and pledge of that happy life, to which the
Sonne of God hath regenerated and begotten vs by his
precious blood: That it is hee that wipes away our
teares, which giues vs good hope and eternall conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which he ſufficiently ratified then, when he ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly
cauſed the little children to bee brought vnto
him, layd his hands on them, ſaying to his Diſciples,
Suffer little children to come vnto me, and forbid them
not, for to ſuch is the kingdome of heauen. So much
touching the firſt beginnings of our life.</p>
               <p>I come now to other afflictions and croſſes, which
ſeeme to aſſayle, and to lay neere ſiege to aged perſons.
Theſe opponents are ſo mighty and many in number,
which <hi>Salomon</hi> conſidering, hath oftentimes ſayd in his
<hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> That all that is wrought vnder the ſunne is
very vanity; That man reapes no profit of his labour
and trauell, and that all his dayes he feeles affliction and
vexation of ſpirit. Hauing ſhewed that all the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
good, dreamed on in outward and tranſitorie
things, is a meere imagination, hee wiſely concludes,
That this good conſiſteth in the feare of God, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Commandements, declaring that all mans good
conſiſteth heerein: Wee cannot more briefly and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
cleere this point. For whoſoeuer knowes not
God, to reuerence and ſtand in awe of him with a pure
heart, and to ſubſcribe and ſubmit himſelfe to all his
Statutes and Lawes, walketh, not in veritie, but vanity:
Wherefore, it behooues vs euer to come to this point;
That there is nothing more miſerable, then the man
which vnderſtands not, loues not, nor ſeekes after, nor

which happen many times without trauell or paines ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,

to the godly and good. But happy is the man,
which earneſtly lookes vp to God, walking in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and beleeues that all things ſhall further the helpe

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3512:68"/>
hee ſtands faſt and is neuer mooued, he feares no
euill tidings, truſting aſſuredly in the Lord. If he want
the neceſſary things of this life; his riches are in Gods
hand and keeping, who giueth him contentation and
contentment. Hath he a coſtly leud wife, and bad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
children? It is the proofe of his patience, and the
exerciſe of his faith, as it was in <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> of whom,
one had a very ſpitefull ſhrewd wife, and the other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
wholly giuen to lewdneſſe and miſchiefe; wit.
<hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Abſolon.</hi> Is hee ſeized with maladies, hee
calleth to minde what <hi>Baſil</hi> writes vpon the Pſalme 45.
Oftentimes, ſayth he, ſickeneſſe and maladies ſerue to
tame and reclaime vs: On the contrary, ſanitie and
health often hurteth enough, in that it helpes and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
many with occaſions and inſtruments to doe euill
and miſchiefe. Againe in the 124. Epiſtle, hee ſayth,
Make account that a maladie or ſickeneſſe ſerues for a
ſchoolemaſter, wherewith to attaine to this good, that
making no reckoning of the body, you alſo diſpiſe
whatſoeuer is fraile or tranſitory, troubleſome, and paſt
hope or recouery, to be placed in the heauenly compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and to liue in this world, as if already you were in
Paradiſe. Pondering theſe things in your minde, all
your life will bee a day of feaſting and ioy, and it
will bee ioyfull vnto you to impart your ioy to many
others.</p>
               <p>But why ſhould we finde it euill or ſtrange, to ſee our
body hardly handled and kept vnder, which feeling it
ſelfe fat, and well fed, pampred, and at too much eaſe,
will worke the wracke and ruine of the ſoule; and as a
hote furious horſe, boundeth, and reares vp aloft, and
ſeekes how to caſt his rider, and to lay him on the
ground? Vndoubtedly, mans proper ſtrength, is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
vigour of minde, held vp by and depending vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, whoſe power and ſtrength is principally ſeen
and diſcouered in our weakeneſſe. For which cauſe S.
<hi>Paul</hi> writeth; Being weake, I am ſtrong, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 10.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3512:68"/>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> was of the ſame minde in his greateſt agonies
and ſorrowes. I am (ſayth he, in the Pſalme 38.) weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and ſore broken; I roared for the great griefe and
terrour of my heart. O Lord, my deſire is before thee,
&amp; my ſighing is not hid from thee; my heart is toſſed to
and fro; my ſtrength fayleth mee, and the light of mine
eyes; yea they are no more vnto mee. But, ſeeing I
waite on thee, O Lord, thou wilt anſwere, O my God.
Forſake mee not, be not thou farre from mee, my God.
Haſt thee to helpe mee, O Lord, which art my ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So many excellent promiſes diſperſed throughout
the whole Bible, ſhall they not haue the efficacy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme
and encourage vs? Let vs haue a heed full eye (I
pray you) to the reiterated proteſtations of Gods loue
towardes his, of that fier of loue, which all the waters
of the world cannot quench. To which purpoſe <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
ſpake in his laſt Chapter of the <hi>Canticles.</hi> Set mee
as a ſeale on thy heart, and as a ſignet vpon thine
arme, for loue is ſtrong as death, and iealouſie is cruell
as the graue; the coales thereof are fiery coales, and a
very vehement flame: Many waters cannot quench this
loue, and the floodes cannot drowne it: If a man
would giue for it all the ſubſtance of his houſe, it would
be contemned. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> alſo ſayth, in the
Chapter 44. Thus hath the Lord ſayd, that made thee,
and formed thee from the wombe, and which hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
thee. Feare not, O <hi>Iacob,</hi> my ſeruant, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
whom I haue choſen, for I will powre water vpon
him which is thirſtly, and floodes vpon the dry land, I
will powre my Spirit vpon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing
vpon thoſe which proceed out of thy loynes. And in
the Chapter 46. O houſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and all that remaine
of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom I haue borne from the
wombe, and brought vp from the birth. I will doe the
the ſame to your old age, yea I will beare you vntill
your hoare white age: I haue made you, I will beare
you, and I will carry you, I will reſcue and deliuer you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:3512:69"/>
As touching old men (I ſpeake to thoſe that are
wiſe) they ſhall finde in the Scriptures, forcible and
fitting arguments of comfort. For firſt, although the
life of God be bliſſefull and vnchangeable, yet for the
honour and maieſty of his eternity, <hi>Daniel</hi> calles him,
The <hi>Ancient of dayes:</hi> not that therefore it is lawfull to
repreſent God in the ſhape of an old man, with a great
long white beard, as many ignorant folke doe, which
neuer read <hi>Moſes</hi> nor the Prophets, and which are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the nature and eſſence of the true God: But
that wee ſhould conceiue this incomprehenſible Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie,
to bee nothing elſe, but wiſedome, a venerable ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
and greatneſſe of eſtate, and a perfect ſanctitie.
Secondly, wee are taught to reuerence old men, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
their perſons, to riſe vp with great reſpect to
theſe white heads and beards, and to ſhew thereby,
that we acknowledge in this their old age, the ſtampes
and prints of God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> exhorts vs in the 19.
Chap. <hi>Leuit.</hi> v. 32. which we recite to the ſame end and
purpoſe, as wee haue done other ſayings and ſentences
before, whereunto wee adde this of a wiſe Elder, who
writ <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> in the third Chapter of which booke,
hee ſayth; My ſonne helpe thy father in his age, and
grieue him not ſo long as hee liueth; when his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
faileth him, haue patience and beare with him,
and diſpiſe him not, but honour him as much as thou
canſt. For the good intreaty of thy father ſhall not bee
forgotten, but ſhall bee a fortreſſe for thee againſt thy
ſinnes. The women of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> are friendly and kind
to the good old <hi>Naomi,</hi> for that her daughter in law
<hi>Ruth,</hi> had borne a ſonne to <hi>Boaz.</hi> This (ſay they) may
bring life againe to thee, and lenghthen thy dayes, and
cheriſh and comfort thine old age. <hi>Ruth.</hi> 4. 15. God by
his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> reprochet the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> that they
were cruell and vnmerciful to the Iewes, and laid a very
heauy yoke vpon them, Chap. 47. 6. Alſo theſe wicked
people were as hammers, which the iuſt Iudge of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3512:69"/>
world vſed to breake in peeces the old and the young,
as <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſpeakes in the 52. Chapter, Verſ. 22. whence
proceeded thoſe woes, and alaſſes of the Prophet in his
Lamentations 4. Chap Verſ. 16. They reuerenced not
the face of the Prieſts, nor had compaſſion of the
Elders. And in the fift Chapter following, Verſ. 12.
The Princes are hanged vp by the hands, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
not the face of the Elders. That which <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel</hi>
propoſeth in the 9. chap. v. 6. is moſt feareful, and it
ſufficeth vs to marke and obſerue it, that our wiſe <hi>Vicil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard</hi>
doe thereby take heed. On the contrary, in <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riahs</hi>
dayes, there being a queſtion and demurre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the reeſtabliſhment of the people, and of the
fauours that God was minded to beſtow vpon them,
<hi>Zachariah</hi> declares in the 8. Chapter Verſ. 4. That the
God of hoſtes, ſayd thus, There ſhall old men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
dwell in the ſtreetes of <hi>Ierufalem,</hi> and euery man
haue his ſtaffe in his hand for very age. But <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in the
third Chapter, Verſ. 2. and 5. putteth for ſignes of the
terrible iudgement of God to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> That the old
men ſhall be taken away and deſtroyed, that the childe
ſhall exalt himſelfe and preſume againſt the auncient,
and the abiect and vile, againſt the honourable. If in
theſe times there bee any preſage of the decay and ruine
of Churches and Common-weales, it is that the
number of wiſe old men is very ſmal, that the age of the
worthies and renowned men is vaniſhed and paſt: That
thoſe that are children in yeares and vnderſtanding, are
percht vp and ſet vp in the places of the experienced va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
and learned. An extreame miſery which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſufficiently deſcribe and lament.</p>
               <p>But as good fruit when it is ripeſt and mellow, is moſt
delicate and pleaſant to the taſte, and as the laſt draught
contenteth the thirſtie perſon: In like ſort, pleaſure
ſeemes to reſerue her dainties to the laſt, and for the laſt
ſeruice and meſſe. So likewiſe wee ſay, that old age
hath in it, I know not what, that is notable and more
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3512:70"/>
excellent then other ages, and the ſayings of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
as the ſinging of ſwannes, are daily excellent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors
and admonitions to vs. If wee liſten to the laſt
wordes of the Patriarches, <hi>Moſes, Ioſhua, Dauid,</hi> and
giue them the hearing, wee ſhall in them finde an ample
proofe heereof. Such Hiſtories are familiar to wiſe old
men, and it is much better to read them in themſelues,
then heere to recite them. What illumination of Gods
ſpirit is reuealed and manifeſt in the ſayings of infinite
Martyrs, eſpecially of ſuch as were old, euen from the
Apoſtles time till now? It is matter for a greater booke
then this ſmall Tractat, or Manuel. In the ſecond booke
of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> Chap. 6. It is ſpoken of <hi>Eleazar,</hi>
one of the chiefe Scribes, an aged man, who being preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and inſtantly ſolicited, to feigne and make ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
to adhere and obey to the ſuperſtitions of the
Heathens, vpon an honeſt and vpright minde worthy
his age, the excellency of his yeares, the honour of his
gray hayres, his good conuerſation from his childhood,
and chiefly Gods holy law, ſuddenly required that hee
might bee led to the place of execution, adding theſe
words worthy of memory. It becommeth not our age
to diſſemble, leaſt many yong perſons diffident and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering,
that <hi>Eleazar</hi> being fourſcore and tenne yeares
old, was gone and yeelded to prophane ceremonies,
thorough mine hypocriſie and diſſimulation (for a ſmal
moment of a caduque and tranſitory life) might bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
and I bring a malediction and curſe and a ſtaine
and reproach to mine old age: for though I ſhould bee
deliuered from the torments of men, yet could I not
eſcape the hand of the Almightie, neither aliue nor
dead. Wherefore, manfully changing and giuing vp
this life, I ſhall ſhew my ſelfe ſuch as mine age requireth
and meriteth: And I ſhall leaue a notable example for
ſuch as be young, to die willingly and couragiouſly for
the venerable and holy lawes. To this worthy old
man, let vs ioyne the conſtant Martyr <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3512:70"/>
Diſciple of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoſtle, and of the Church of
<hi>Smyrna</hi> in <hi>Aſia.</hi> As he was brought to the torturing fire,
the <hi>Proconſul</hi> hauing moſt earneſtly ſolicited him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
and renounce his faith, with promiſe of libertie: I
haue, ſaid this wiſe old man and conſtant Martyr,
theſe foureſcore and ſixe yeares ſerued Ieſus Chriſt, and
all this time he did me no outrage nor hurt; how ſhould
it then be poſſible to bring me to bee of the minde to
blaſpheme my Sauiour and King? I will neuer doe it.
If you feigne and pretend you know not my qualitie,
I would haue you to know that I am a Chriſtian. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other words of admirable conſtancie were then vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by this reuerend old man, who being armed with
inuincible courage, preſently ſuffred death for the
name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Theſe two examples ſhall ſuffice to ſhew, that the
neerer wiſe old men are vnto death, be it eaſie or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
the greater is their courage, the neerer are they
to the kingdome of Heauen: And ſtill as their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
growe weake, the holy Ghoſt doth fortifie and
ſtrengthen them in ſuch ſorte, that no tormentes
nor tortures canne quell, or diſmay their ſtoute
minde; nor no Bug-beare, or terror is gaſtly or hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
enough to fray and affright them.</p>
               <p>The Lord hauing made a couenant with his Church,
which here on earth is compounded of all ſorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
hath giuen vnto it two ſtrong propps of hope, to
wit, his ſpirit, and his true word. This ſpirit is called
the ſpirit of wiſedome, vnderſtanding, counſell, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
knowledge, of ſanctification, veritie, conſolation,
life, faith, grace.</p>
               <p>The word is called, the word of life, of ſaluation,
of the grace of God, of our reconciliation with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Heauen: A word teſtifying that all thinges
were giuen vs neceſſary to life, and pietie, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of him, who hath called vs by his owne power
and glorie, by which are giuen vnto vs great and preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3512:71"/>
promiſes, that by them wee (which are regenerated
by the holy Ghoſt, and the word) ſhould be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the diuine nature, being deliuered and freed
from the concupiſcences and corruptions of the world.
Whoſoeuer hath not this ſpirit of Ieſus Chriſt, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth
not in the promiſes of God, a midd all his babble
and prattle of the contempt of death, and the benefit of
old age, is ſtill in doubt, hath feeble hands, trembling
and ſtaggering knees, haltes, feedes himſelfe with the
winde, and not with any aſſured conſolation. But the
iuſt doe liue by faith, are ſtrengthened and vpheld by it,
which makes them reioyce all wayes in the Lord, who
ſanctifies them, preſerues whole and entire their mind,
ſoule, and bodie vnblameable, vntill the comming of
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>

But before we enter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
we will propound to
our wiſe <hi>Vieillard</hi> an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
drawne and taken out
of the volumes of ſacred
Philoſophie, to leade him
more eaſily on to that
whereunto he aſpires. But it behooueth thoſe who are
almoſt at their wayes end, more heedfully to conſider
both the way they haue gone, and are to goe, for their
further encouragement to their dutie. Behold then what
I pretend to remember to whomſoeuer being in old
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3512:71"/>
age will vouchſafe to hearken to him who is drawing
neere vnto it. It is reaſon that the grace of God, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
in ſo many ſortes ſo many yeares, and ſealed in
our Baptiſme at our firſt entrance into the world, and
into the Church, when we haue rightly apprehended in
whom we are dead and in whom quickned; doe cauſe
vs to wiſh a continuall ſenſe and feeling of our adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by his ſpirit, ſpeaking to vs by his word, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing
with our ſpirit that we are the ſonnes of God.
This ſenſe and feeling doth engender or beget an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
deſire, an earneſt devotion, a firme reſolution,
to yeeld him obedience all our life long, but more at the
diſſolution, and end of our life, then at the beginning,
which is devoide of knowledge, conſcience, experience,
wiſedome, plunged and drowned the greater part of
tyme in ignorance, ſelfe opinion, inſolencie, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauld
and laſciuious impudencie. Now then it behooues
ſo ſoone as we feele the motions of this grace, that our
hearts be repleniſhed with a ſincere and liuely affection
to obey God, not according to our worldly ſenſe, but
following the rule which he himſelfe doth propoſe and
ſet downe vnto vs. Touching this affection it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
vnto vs by generall and ſpeciall reaſons. The
generall reaſons are; that our God is holy, and that we
his people cannot cleaue vnto him, except we bee holy
likewiſe: then as members belonging to Ieſus Chriſt
our head and redeemer, we ought to be made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to him, imitating his life, which is called the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to God his Father, euen to the death of the
croſſe. The ſpeciall reaſons are; Firſt, that God is our
Father. Secondly, that Chriſt hath waſhed vs by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
bloud, and incorporated vs into him. Thirdly,
that this our head is aſcended vp into heauen. Fourthly,
that we are the temples of the holy Ghoſt. Fiftly, that
our bodies be predeſtinated to the laſt reſurrection, and
our ſoules to immortalitie, both of them to euerlaſting
glorie. Whereupon it followes, that it is horrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3512:72"/>
not to be willing to obey the will of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father; that it is madneſſe to returne to the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
from which we haue beene ſo dearely and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
cleanſed and purged; that it is deteſtable iniquitie
to wiſh and to will the members of Ieſus Chriſt to bee
ioyned to Sathan, and to the world; that is but reaſon
for euer to burie all earthly affection; to aſpire to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life; to be by a liuely faith ſet in the heauenly places,
and to feele and taſte of life and euerlaſting glory; that
we muſt not grieue him which dwelleth in vs, our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor,
guide, and comforter: That it is good reaſon, to
preſerue our ſelues immaculate, and pure, euen vntill
the day of our Lord.</p>
               <p>Hauing treated of our affection, let vs ſpeake of the
rule thereof declared in ſuch wiſe, and ſo expreſſely
in the law of God, to make vs yet to ſee, as the ſoule
and mayne of all, that his good pleaſure hath beene, to
forme and faſhion our manners, by a moſt exact man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and order, and which ſerues as a commentarie of all
that is contayned in the ſayd Law: That is, that wee
ſhould renounce our ſelues, to the end to be fit to apply
and frame our ſelues ſincerely and wholly to ſerue
God, becauſe we are not our owne but Gods. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it followes, that a Chriſtian (be he young or old,
and the old is more bound to this dutie, then the yong,
becauſe God hath vpheld and ſupported him long, hath
beſtowed many bleſſings and benefites on him, and a
bleſſed life, whereinto hee is nowe entring) ought to
ſearch and learne out, what God willeth and approueth,
briefely, whatſoeuer ſerueth to the advancement of his
glorie. Thoſe which are of an other minde, are ſtyled
and tearmed by the voyce of truth, vngracious, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
vngratefull, reprobates. All theſe licentious and
inordinate humours S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
vnder the word, <hi>Impietie:</hi> To which, hee
oppoſeth the duties of Chriſtians, marſhalled and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
vnder the three excellent giftes of the holy Ghoſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3512:72"/>
in the regenerate, to wit, ſobrietie, iuſtice, and pietie.
And in this ſacred triangle is included the renouncing
of our ſelues. And the Apoſtle not without cauſe hath
begun with <hi>temperance,</hi> which eſpecially concernes vs,
which moderates our luſtes, and deſires, baniſhing and
driuing away ſenſuall, carnall, worldly, and vncleane,
and filthie affections, much more their deteſtable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes
and effectes. It is ſhee which doth faſhion and
frame vs to a true ſquare, rulle, and order, as well in the
moderation of our wiſhes, and dreames of worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and greatneſſe, as of our inordinate beaſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences,
ſuggeſted by the vncleane ſpirit; In the
violent purſuite, ſeeking, and hunting after, proud v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurping,
ſacrilegious detayning, and miſerable poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of goods, not goods, but periſhing and tranſitorie,
and which doe not enlarge the ſtraight boundes of this
preſent life, where wee are confined (and this is our
happineſſe, comfort, tranquilitie) to deliuer vp and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
our perſons, goods, our affaires, briefely, all that
we loue, into the handes of our heauenly Father, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beſeeching him euery houre to ſubdue, guide, and
gouerne our heartes by his grace and power. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it followes, that it ill becomes all Chriſtians, much
more wiſe old men, to be voluptuous, ambitious, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous:
Alſo that in all the accidents and chances of
our life, we ought quietly to ſubmit and yeeld to the
will of God.</p>
               <p>Touching the word <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> which reſpecteth our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
toward our neighbours, it requireth two thinges:
The one is, that wee rightly examining and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
what we our ſelues are, wee ſhould preferre others
before vs; the other, that our ſtudie and endeuour tend
to this end, faithfully to procure their benefit and good.
In this behalfe, it is wholly requiſite that we be furniſhed
with humilitie, patience, a frank and liberall mind, leaſt
we fall into the neglect and contempt as well of thoſe
that are of the houſhold of faith, as of thoſe which ſeeme
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3512:73"/>
not to be, not ſhrowding our ſelues vnder this vaine
ſubterfuge, ſhift, and coullor, that our neighbour is a
ſtranger, one we know not, contemptuous, baſe, vile,
vngrateful, an enemie vnto vs. For to all this the law
of humanitie, charitie, the image of God, his honour,
mercie, and goodneſſe makes a ſuyply.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, euery good doing and deede ought to
proceed from a well informed conſcience, &amp; a ſincere
affection of heart, without which our workes are ſoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and tainted with damnable hypocriſie, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
confidence, vaine arrogancie, infamous reproch,
fond opinions; As that God is our debtor to repay and
requite vs, that our neighbours are exceedingly boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and obliged vnto vs; yea, that hauing performed
ſome ſmall dutie in this, or in that, wee are freed and
diſcharged (euen in the ſight of him of whom we hold
all that we haue, to whom we owe all that we haue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whom we are nothing of our ſelues, without whom
we can doe nothing of our ſelues, of whom onely wee
ought to glorie, in whom alone it behooues vs to put
our affiance and truſt) from all other duties of charity,
whereof we willingly make our ſelues ignorant, or baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refuſe, neither louing God, nor our neighbours, nor
ourſelues, and liuing one with another as brute beaſtes
before the eyes of our iuſt Iudge.</p>
               <p>But it is requiſite that our wiſe <hi>Vieillard</hi> mount vp yet
higher, though the way bee narrow, rugged, vneuen,
ſteepe, and headlong, to wit, that he bee continually
readie and prepared to beare the croſſe, which God
layes vpon him, that is, to be exerciſed within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
by diuerſe temptations, and afflictions all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
and reſt of his dayes. If from his youth he hath
borne the yoke, hath not bin brought vp in the ſhade,
but hath endured ſtormes, cold, and extreame parching
heate, his travaile toward the euening of his life will
be leſſe tedious, ſeeing the houre of his reſt is neere and
at hand. Hereupon he will call to minde that his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3512:73"/>
Father, who from the cratch did handle in like
manner his owne, and onely beloued ſonne, will alſo
that his members be made conformable to their head,
and hath predeſtinated them thereunto: whereof this
moſt excellent comfort doth follow, that being vnder
the croſſe, we partake of the afflictions and ſuffrings of
our Lord. Furthermore, for diuers reaſons, afflictions
are neceſſary for Chriſtians, more particularly to old
men. Firſt, the vaine aſſurance of their fleſh, the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their ſufficiencie, their obſtinate ſelfe-willd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt,
their arrogancie, require ſuch a correctiue.
Secondly, they haue need to be kept in humilitie, and in
a reuerend awe of God, to the end ſo much the more
heartily to ſeeke and ſue for his grace, without which it
would be impoſſible for them to ſtand vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
much leſſe to ſauour and reliſh well how ſweete,
and wonderfull the Lord is in their bodily and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
deliuerances. Thirdly, It is neceſſary alſo that their
patience and obedience, may more euidently appeare,
it being vnpoſſible for them to ſtoppe vnto God, if hee
doe not awe and reclaime them by afflictions. Fourthly,
Their life paſt is had in remembrance, to the end, that
being chaſtiſed in this world by the rod of a Father, they
may bee kept in order in their maiſters ſeruice, who
ſcourging their bodies, comforteth and ſaueth their
ſoules in the hope of the laſt reſurrection; briefely, hee
chaſtiſeth thoſe that are his in this world, that they may
not periſh with the world.</p>
               <p>Now among the ſundry ſortes of croſſes and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
one among others carries with it ſingular content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as when wee ſhall ſuffer for righteouſneſſe, for
Chriſts name ſake, for the maintenance and defence of
Gods word and truth. Chriſtians willingly lay downe
their neckes vnder the light yoke of the Lord, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
at it, not with a ſtupid, or haſtie mad braine-ſicke,
or fond toying ioy; their reioycing is ſpirituall, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with that magnanimous reſolution, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3512:74"/>
in the Apoſtles, after they had receiued the holy
Ghoſt, and in all their true Diſciples. This doth not
vanquiſh nor aboliſh true patience, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſting in this, that
Chriſtians doe not faint altogether vnder the burthen
that preſſeth them: But in the anguiſh and bitterneſſe
of their heartes feele the ſweetneſſe of the conſolations
of the holy Ghoſt, which comforteth and ſtrengtheneth
them vnto the end, ſo as the loue of God vanquiſheth
the vanitie which cumbers them in the world. In this
appeareth wherein the Philoſophers patience differs
from the Chriſtians. One ſayth, that it is an vnreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
neceſſitie, or doing of that which muſt bee done,
and counſelleth to beare what is vnavoidable: But
the other telles vs, that wee ought ſo to depend vpon
the conſideration of the iuſt, wiſe, and good will of
God, that wee acknowledge that our ſufferings in the
world are equall, agreeable, honourable, profitable:
that therefore wee ought to bee couragious and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in them, glorying in the conſtancie that our God
giueth vs, and will alwayes giue vs at need.</p>
               <p>The principall fruit, which the wiſe <hi>Vieillard</hi> may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the tree of affliction, is, that by the taſte
thereof he ſhould be enured to contemne this preſent
life, which would beguile and bewitch him, if all things
ſucceeded according to his ſenſuall appetite and luſt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
this fruit makes him by faith, to reliſh and taſte
the ſweetneſſe and pleaſure of the happy life, which is
reſerued for vs in heauen. For if in youth and old age,
We ſee nothing but troubles, and dangers in our courſe
heere on earth, if our delights bee mingled with griefes,
our hony with gall, our pleaſures bee ſteeped and dren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in diſtaſtes and diſcontentments, our mirth end in
teares, to what purpoſe ſhould wee ſtart backe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire?
And why ſhould wee bee ſorrie to goe out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to goe into the Palace of libertie; out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of ſinners, to be with the iuſt, and in the heauenly
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to reſt from our labours? But as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3512:74"/>
to old and young to haue their hearts, where
there treaſure is, which ought to be in heauen, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
not to be affectionated, and inamoured of this
preſent life, which is indeed no life, and is forbidden
them to loue the world and the things in the world:
So muſt they not hate and abhorre this earthly life, nor
take occaſion by the cumbers thereof, to bee ingrate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
God, much leſſe to mutter and murmure againſt
his iuſtice, or to cenſure his prouidence: Seeing that
our life here, though ſhort, painefull, and miſerable, is an
excellent gift, yea, an aſſured teſtimony of Gods loue
and fauour to vs. Let vs then ſo vſe it, that whatſoeuer
we ſhall abate (if wee bee wiſe) of the diſordinate loue
thereof, may be added to a feruent and holy deſire to be
with the ſooneſt receiued into heauen. For wee ſhould
doe ill, to wiſh death, but to be with the Lord, to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him in the triumphant Church, more compleately
and fully, then in the Church militant. Let vs onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
for this cauſe to liue on earth, to prayſe our Father
which is in heauen, and let vs ſtand and keepe ſentinell,
to wit, our vocation, wherein our chiefetaine and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
head hath placed vs, till he call vs away, which
is by the call and hand of death. True it is, that old men
are no leſſe frighted and skared, ſometimes more, then
young men, when we tell them of death. But the deſire
to be with our Sauiour in heauen, ought ſo to ouercome
this frailty, that faith may perſwade vs deuoutly to wiſh
that which nature is afraide of. By what badges and
collours ſhould we be knowne to be Chriſtians, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers,
if wee ſhould ſo much feare the day of death,
which brings vs to the true land of the liuing? Should
we not be more wretched then the beaſts, if wee ſhould
not leap and skip for ioy, pronouncing theſe comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wordes, I beleeue the remiſſion of ſinnes, the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the fleſh, the life euerlaſting. Are not theſe
the priuiledges of the holy vniuerſall, or Catholique
Church, and of the communion of Saints? Then ſhall
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3512:75"/>
our miſeries and infinite temptations bee aboliſhed:
Then ſhall wee enioy vnſpeakeable glory in heauen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all them, when after this happy reſurrection, all
our enemies ſhall be vanquiſhed, and God ſhall bee all
in all to his elect.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch, as the way to heauen lies open vnto
vs in earth, it is requiſite that Chriſtians old and young,
know to vſe well this preſent life, and the meanes to
ſupport it; becauſe without this knowledge and skill,
there is nothing but perills, miſchances, and diſtaſters
in our terrene and earthly pilgrimage, which it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to ayde, comfort, and further (not to hinder and
let) by vſing our meanes well, as well by a ſupply to
our neceſſities, as by honeſt lawfull recreations, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to our ages and callings. In both theſe reſpects,
two extreamities are to be ſhunned; Too great auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
on the one ſide; diſſolution, and intemperance
on the other. Thoſe which boaſt and glory before God
and men, of a certaine hypocriticall, and diſſembled ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence
and continence, and moulded in their owne
fancies, or others like themſelues, are way wardly wiſe
and <hi>Timons,</hi> enemies of honeſt ſocietie; perſons which
haue but a vaine, ridiculous ſhew and appearance, who
for the the moſt part commit in ſecret, things reſerued
to the iuſt puniſhment of the Lord: perſons vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
vnindifferent to themſelues and others, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the doctrine of holineſſe, true Chriſtian liberty,
enemies to Ieſus Chriſt, his offices and benefits. All the
life of Gods children, who in the Common weale,
Church, and their owne families, are profitable ſeruants
and miniſters, condemneth theſe frantike wizards,
who haue made their vaunt and boaſt of a Moonkiſh
lazie life, who vnder player-like habits, haue hatched
the greateſt pride and counterfeite confidence that may
be imagined, who haue inſolently defied, and ſpit at the
lawfull recreations of good men, and conuerted the
graces of the Lord into vncouth and ſtrange diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3512:75"/>
But to ſtirre this filth no longer: As thoſe that are
young and old indued with the feare of the Lord,
know that it is permitted them to vſe the goods and
things of thig life, not onely for neceſſity, but alſo for
honeſt delight, ſo it be to the glory of God, the reliefe
of their neighbour, and the common edification of all,
and to bee for their owne particuler, ſo much the more
adapted and fitted to conuerſe and keepe company: So
doe they not ceaſe to condemne, as much as their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
requires all diſſolutions, enormous, and licentious
liuing, in fine, all abuſe of the things of this life. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it is good to remember: Firſt, that all the goods wee
poſſeſſe, were ordained, that wee ſhould duely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the Author and giuer of them, magnifying with
thankſgiuing his liberality to vs, which intemperate and
diſſolute perſons cannot doe. Secondly, that all theſe
goods ought to bee abandoned, yea accounted as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
euen diſpiſed as dung, in compariſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
knowledge of our ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſt, and
of that glory which is reſerued for vs in heauen, which
is quenched and dyeth, when we are too much addicted
and wedded to goods tranſitory and periſhing: For as
much as wee exceſſiuely abuſe them in proſperitie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them inſtruments of our ruine and hurt, which are
to procure helpe, and further our good: For that alſo we
being depriued of them, ceaſe not to thinke and to ſay,
that all is loſt and gone, that we are miſerable. Indeed
ſo wee are in carrying our ſelues thus; but wee haue a
good Lord, who doth infinitely helpe and ſupport vs;
but it is to binde and oblige vs ſo much the more to our
dutie. Thirdly, that the holy Scripture for the ordering
of our goods, doth teach vs, that they are giuen to vs
vpon condition to yeeld account of them ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
yea, by him that hath expreſly forbidden the abuſe
of them, whom alſo wee cannot deceiue or abuſe.
Fourthly, that to diſcerne the right vſe from the abuſe

in all the actions of this life, caſt his eyes, and looke to
his vocation and calling, that he raſhly vndertake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor with a doubting and vnreſolued conſcience.
Whereupon it followes, that infidels, ſuperſtitious, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt,
diſſolute, prophane perſons and Atheiſts, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly
culpable and guilty before God, becauſe they
outragiouſly and aboue meaſure abuſe this preſent life,
and the good they poſſeſſe in it; all things being pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them, they themſelues being polluted both in
body and minde. For concluſion of our counſell and
aduice, the wiſe <hi>Vieillard</hi> ſhall remember, that the life of
euery Chriſtian young and old, conſiſteth in theſe ſixe
Articles. Firſt, That we haue a ſincere affection to obey
God. Secondly, That the doctrine of the Prophets and
Apoſtles, contained in the Canonical Bookes of the old
and new Teſtament, is the rule of his obedience. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That he renounce himſelfe, to the end to yeeld and
ſubmit himſelfe vnto God. Fourthly, That he patiently
and cheerfully beare the croſſe, that is, all kind of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it ſhall pleaſe God to inflict vpon him. Fifthly,
That in all his courſe of life, hee meditate vpon that bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life which is prepared in heauen. Sixthly, That the
vſe of tranſitory goods doe prouoke, and incite him to
goe forward more couragiouſly to the end of his high
calling.</p>

man, eſpecially he that is farre gone in yeares, ought
continually to haue Ieſus Chriſt in his meditation and
thought, which he ſhall ſtay and ſettle vpon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
following. As Ieſus Chriſt after he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed,
was ſolemnly, and with a loud voyce from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
declared to be the beloued Sonne, in whom the
Father delighted: So a Chriſtian inwardly may know,
by the efficacy of the holy Spirit, witneſſing in and
with his, that he is the childe of God. And when after
his initiation and entry into the houſe of God, ſealed
by the ſacred ſigne of Baptiſme, it happeneth vnto him
at many yeares end, to bee led into the deſart, as his
head was, there to bee brought to extreame hunger, to
be preſſed with ſundry neceſſities and wants, enuironed
with the dangers, perſecutions, miſeries and aduerſities
of this world, by meanes whereof Sathan aſſayeth to
make him thinke (as he aſſayled on the ſame ſide at firſt
our Lord Ieſus) that he is out of the number of Gods
children, being deſtitute of all helpes and comforts, and
many wayes perplexed; Thou oughteſt not, O wiſe
<hi>Vieillard,</hi> of what quality or condition ſoeuer thou be,
to reſigne and yeeld vp the buckler of faith, but oppoſing
it againſt the fiery darts of that wicked one, firmely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
that God is thy Father, hath care of thee, that all
his viſitations are full of loue, doe proceed from his
wiſedome, for his glory, and thy ſaluation and welfare.
I know that this outragious one will perſeuer and goe
on in his calumny, will ſay that thou ſhouldeſt make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
vnto God, if thou bee one of his children, that
theſe ſtones be turned into bread, that is, that theſe hard,
ſharpe, and violent aduerſities, which doe batter and
ſplit in peeces thy heart be changed into proſperitie:
But doe thou anſwere as thy Sauiour, that the children
of God are not ſuſtayned and maintained by goodes,
and things tranſitorie, and periſhing, but by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and by his rich, and bleſſed promiſes. If he charge
and ſet vpon thee another way, exclamining, that if
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3512:77"/>
thou thinke thy ſelfe ſo priuiledged, that thou ſhouldeſt
caſt thy ſelfe downe headlong from the top of the pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of the temple, that is, from the high degree of the
ſpirituall, politicall, oeconomicall dignitie and iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherin thou art promoted and aduanced far higher
and aboue many others, to tumble thy ſelfe into ſome
ſtinking ſinke of impietie, iniuſtice, defamatorie lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and villanie, and he doe add withall that nothing
ſhall follow of it, which thou oughteſt to feare, that no
body ſhall know ought of it, that thou ſhalt haue a foule
wide mouth, and a braſen impudent face, to deny all;
yea euen that God is much obliged to thee, that his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
haue a care of thee, that thou alwayes haue at a
pynch of need ready in thy ſleeue a good <hi>peccaui,</hi> that
whatſoeuer happen, if thou goe the way leading to hell,
it is notwithſtanding the way to Paradiſe: Make him
this anſwere, It is written, Thou ſhalt not tempt the
Lord thy God; but on the contrary, ſeeing that of his
ſo great benignity, goodneſſe, and grace he hath made
mee his, I am ſo much the more obliged and bound to
honour him, thanke him, and to ſtudy and indeuour to
aſſure my calling. Againe, if the tempter ſet before
thine eyes all the world, and thereupon demaund of
thee to doe him homage and worſhip, thou feeling thy
ſelfe by faith to bee the ſonne of God, and heyre of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
diſdaine, and diſpiſe theſe ſhadowes, dreames,
ſmoakie vapours, falling downe proſtrate before the
only true God, thy hope, life, and ſaluation. Who, where-as
thou wert by nature a childe of wrath, a member of
the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> a brance of a thorny, bitter, venomous,
corrupt, and wilde plant, hath cut and taken thee from
it, and graffed thee into Ieſus Chriſt, the ſtocke of life,
and the fruitfull, pure oliue branch, ſo that thou haſt
beene made a liuing member of him: which requires
that thou haue neyther ſtrength or vigour, nor motion
or progreſſe whatſoeuer; but as thou art mooued and
directed by the Spirit of Ieſus Chriſt dwelling in thee:
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3512:77"/>
that thou oughteſt not to thinke, to will, deſire, or doe
any thing, but by diuine inſpiration, and as much as is
behoouefull for a liuing and ſpirituall member of the
Lord. Vpon this thou art bound often to meditate,
eſpecially when the caſe is ſo, that thou art put to thy
tryall, and to ſtand to thy tackling; And when thou
doeſt any thing vnbeſeeming, and not agreeing to the
dignity of a Chriſtian, of one adopted of God, and of a
brother and member of Chriſt, be aſhamed of thy ſelfe,
and deferre not to repent and amend.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as our Sauiour was crucified, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
that all his members ought to bee nayled to the
croſſe with him. Which is firſt done by a feruent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as it falles out to all thoſe, who being enflamed, and
changed by an intire loue to their Redeemer, feele all his
ſufferings, and are mortified with him in his croſſe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
thou muſt yet in another manner bee crucfied
with Ieſus Chriſt; to wit, if thy feete will trample and
trot vp and downe, to and fro in the world to doe
ſome euill, nayle them to the croſſe of the Lord, with
ſtrong nayles of charity. Does as much to thy hands, if
they enterprize and take vpon them to doe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
ſome miſcheeuous act and deſigne, and with thy
wanton luſtfull eyes, including and ſhutting vp in
Chriſt thy intellect and vnderſtanding, with his cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
the will with her deſires and luſtes, and the
ſoule with all her faculties and powers, ſo that all the
old <hi>Adam</hi> being crucified, the ſaying of the Apoſtle
may be verified in thee, That thoſe that are of Chriſt,
haue crucified their fleſh with the luſtes thereof; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
thou oughteſt further to be faſtened in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to the croſſe of Chriſt, that as when hee hanged on
the croſſe, he was beheld naked, forlorne, emptied and
deſtitute of all the fauour, friendſhip, reſpect, and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of men, of all worldly riches, pompes dignities,
and pleaſures, by reaſon whereof himſelfe ſaid, That
the Prince of the world found nothing of his in him:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3512:78"/>
So likewiſe is it requiſite, that thou being emptied, and
ſtripped of the world, and the concupiſcences and luſtes
thereof, ſhouldeſt be wholly changed and deuoted to
further and aduance the glory of God. Whereupon the
Apoſtle ſaid; That our old man is crucified, that the
body of ſinne may be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Our Lord hauing beene nayled to his croſſe is there-dead,
and wee his members ought to die to the world
and to our ſelues, in ſuch ſort that as thoſe which are
dead, we ſhould make no more reckoning of the things
of the world, ſhould be without ſenſe or feeling of them,
and ſhould haue neither ſynewe, nor veyne ſtretching
or tending that way. To this purpoſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the
<hi>Coloſſians,</hi> you are dead, and your life is hidd in Chriſt.
Furthermore, we muſt alſo be buried with the ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.
He that is dead hath no more care of the world,
yet before he be buryed, the world hath care to winde
him vp in a ſheete, to Coffyn him, then to carry him to
his graue, where being interred, all ſocietie and dealing
one with another is at an end. In this ſort, many who
thinke themſelues to be dead to the world, pretending
and making ſemblance to haue renounced it, are not
yet buryed, becauſe the world makes great account of
them, doth reuerence and worſhip them. But it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
vs to be dead and buryed to the world, in ſuch
ſorte as we haue as ſmall accompt and eſteeme of it, as
of a ſtinking carrion, and that it eſteeme ſo of vs. For
it is an ill ſigne, when the children of this world ſpeake
well of vs. It is then a thing requiſite and neceſſary,
that we be buryed with Ieſus Chriſt by Baptiſme into
his death. And it is fit alſo that we deſcend as our head
into hell, that is, that we haue a right knowledge, and a
liuely feeling of our ſinnes, which is done, when wee
feele in our hearts the loue of God our Father, in Ieſus
Chriſt crucified. For being convicted to haue offended
him, we muſt deſcend to confeſſe, and earneſtly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt,
and abhorre our pride, ignorance, infidelitie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3512:78"/>
obſtinacie, and other vices. Seeing then that theſe
pollutions, and defilements haue ſo much and ſo greatly
diſpleaſed God, that to purge them out of the world, he
hath deliuered his owne ſonne to death, we are brought
to this point, in ſome ſorte to know our miſery, and
how much we our ſelues doe diſpleaſe God. Moreouer,
as the Sauiour is riſen againe, ſo his members ought to
riſe againe in newneſſe of life, in ſuch ſort that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
they haue no motion, or inclination whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
but to glorifie God, walking as perſons whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
is alreadie in heauen. Chriſt is riſen againe,
therefore his members ought to riſe againe, not onely
at the laſt day, but hourely and continually in newneſſe
of life, ſo that thence forward they haue no motion, or
diſpoſition whatſoeuer, but to glorifie God. Chriſt is
riſen immortall, for that hauing triumphed ouer death,
death hath no more dominion ouer him. Thereupon
S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſayth to Chriſtians, ſeeing our Sauiour hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
for vs in the fleſh, it is reaſon that we be armed and
reſolued in mind, that he which hath ſuffred in the fleſh
hath ceaſed from ſinne; willing and ready to ſay, that
Chriſt the head, pledge, and ſuretie for all Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
comming to die, conſequently to ſatisfie fully and
wholly the Iuſtice of God for them, hath clearely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
the debt for all his members, who are obliged
to him, (vnleſſe they would crucifie him againe, and
hold the precious bloud of the euerlaſting couenant for
a prophane thing) to ceaſe and giue ouer to ſinne. For
being dead to ſinne, buryed to the world, riſen againe
to God, they ought to ſinne no more, nor to die in
ſinne, much leſſe to remaine dead therein: Sinne ought
no more to raigne, nor haue dominion in them, they
ought no longer to obey their euill luſtes, but to curbe
and reſtraine them by the ſpirit, which doth quicken,
guide, and gouerne them. Our Lord is aſcended vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
heauen; In like ſort, if we be liuing members of his
myſticall body, we ought zealouſly, and with all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3512:79"/>
to be elevated and raiſed vp vnto God, truely
to ſay with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that our conuerſation is in heauen.
The ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayd to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> Chapter 3. 1.
If you be riſen againe with Chriſt, ſeeke the thinges
which are aboue, that is, heauenly and diuine not earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſenſuall.</p>
               <p>Now as this good Sauiour ſoone after his aſcenſion
into heauen, for a teſtimony of his infinite glory, in that
he is ſet at the right hand of God the Father Almightie,
ſent his holy ſpirit in a viſible forme vpon his twelue
diſciples; So we likewiſe after we are raiſed vp to God,
ſhall feele our ſelues filled with this ſpirit, and with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
charitie, which will then appeare, when wee ſhall
illuminate, kindle, and inflame our neighbours in the
loue of God, not onely with our wordes, but eſpecially
with our doings and deedes, by the good examples of a
blameleſſe life. Ieſus Chriſt ought to come to judge the
quicke and the dead; And if we be his members, a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fayth will make vs to feele the ſweetneſſe of theſe
wordes of our Sauiour: Come yee bleſſed of my Father
poſſeſſe the inheritance prepared for you before the
foundation of the world. Let vs adde, that as the judge
of all, ſhall be judged of none, ſo ſhall it be with all his
true members in the great and laſt day. And who ſhould
judge them? ſeeing the Father iuſtifieth them in his ſon,
and by the mouth of his ſonne pronounceth them juſt,
bleſſed, and heires of the kingdome of heauen. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt Ieſus denounceth, that he which heareth his
word, and beleeueth in him, hath eternall life, and ſhall
not come to condemnation, that is, ſhall not be judged
but is paſſed from death to life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 24.</p>
               <p>This needes no further expoſition; And it were to
blaſpheme, whoſoeuer would call into queſtion the
certaintie of our ſaluation by Ieſus Chriſt alone, who is
dead for our ſinnes, riſen againe for our iuſtification,
that we might be the righteouſneſſe of God in him. Let
vs ſay further with S. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 2. 3. Know yee not
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3512:79"/>
that the Saints ſhall judge the world? Know yee not
that wee ſhall judge the Angells? But as after the laſt
judgement, Chriſt Ieſus ſhall remaine in heauen in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
glorie; ſo true Chriſtians, already riſen
againe by faith, and ſitting together in the heauenly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations
with their head, hauing their conuerſation in
heauen, ſhall there appeare, and be found all perfect &amp;
entire in their bodies and ſoules with their Sauiour, who
in raiſing them vp againe, ſhall change their vile and
contemptible bodies, ſo as they ſhall bee made confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to his glorious bodie, according to the power,
and efficacie, whereby he is able to ſubdue all things to
himſelfe.</p>
               <p>If wiſe old men doe in a quiet and ſober moode me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
and conſider theſe thinges, euery one of them
hanging downe the head, will cry within himſelfe, O
wretch that I am, God hath made me, by the gift of
knowledge, capable of infinite wonderfull ſecrets and
myſteries, and I ſeeke contentment in vanitie! He hath
created me Lord and commander of all things, and I
am the ſlaue of the Creatures! I ought to ſerue God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
and I am in ſubiection to mine owne inordinate
paſſions! He hath created me vpright, the more eaſily
to behold and looke vp to the place of my felicitie; but
I am more brutiſh then a beaſt, which lookes ſtill downe
to the ground! Chriſt hath made mee a King, and a
Prieſt to God his Father, and ſenſualitie doth tyrannize
and domineer over me, and I ſacrifice to mine owne
inſolencies, and lewdneſſe! O what miſery! Ought I
not to be fruitfull, and abound in all good workes, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
a tree of righteouſneſſe, and a heauenly plant?
What doe I? I draw no breath of life but from the
world, I bring forth nothing but iniquitie, nothing but
poyſon for my ſelfe and others. Am I created after the
Image of God, to be changed into a Beaſt? What reſteth
more for me but to be like the image of God! Should I
I then be a lyar, a villaine, a ſlanderer, an enemy of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3512:80"/>
righteouſneſſe, holineſſe? I am a little world, a
world of wounders! ſhall I then become a bottomleſſe
gulfe of wickedneſſe? I am the end and meaſure of
things, but I am like the mad man which killeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with his owne knife, like the wicked rich man that
damneth himſelfe, and by the winding ſtayres of his
riches goes downe to hell. I ought to be the benefit,
and well-fare of my houſe and familie, of my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood,
of a whole country, to procure true peace
and quietneſſe to rule there, and I trouble mine owne
peace and reſt, and other mens too. I that am the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and rule of all things, am my ſelfe out of all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and order, as much as can bee ſpoken and more.
The veſſell appoynted to honour, which will fill it ſelfe
with ſtinking myre and filth. The temple of the holy
Ghoſt, a moſt holy place, wherein Chriſt onely ought
to enter and lodge, but ſo prophaned that I am aſhamed
to thinke on it. Thou ſayeſt thou art a Chriſtian, and
thou makeſt no conſcience to wallow in impurities, and
hypocriſies, ioyning thy ſelfe with Sathan, Antichriſt,
and the world, ſo little thou regardeſt God, Ieſus Chriſt,
and his Church. Thou that art light, art nothing
but darkeneſſe. Thou that art a ſheepherd, art become
a wolfe. Thou that art the ſalt of the earth, art vnſauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and taſteleſſe. Thou that art the glory and peace of
the world, thou ſoweſt diſgrace, reproch, and trouble
therein. Thou that art the brother, friend, and Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſt
of Chriſt, doeſt thou betray him with a kiſſe?
Thou that art a member of Chriſt, where are the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that thou haſt of the ſpirit? Thou that art Chriſtes
Lieutenant in earth, or in thy houſe, or familie, or over
many houſes, or families, wilt thou daily warre againſt
thy Lord? Chriſt is thy garment, and thou putteſt it off,
to cloath thee with ſhame, ryot, diſſoluteneſſe, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Thou art within three ſtepps, within three fingers
breadth of death, and thou thinkeſt not on the true life,
and thinkeſt onely on the tranſitorie and periſhing life.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3512:80"/>
But thinke on the bleſſinges and honours which God
hath beſtowed on thee, on the dangers, which he hath
guarded and protected thee from, of the true pleaſures
which he offers vnto thee, and thou wilt bee aſhamed of
the falſe pleaſures which vndoe thee, thou wilt bluſh &amp;
be apalled to liue and die as thou doeſt by a poore ſorry
fire: Thou wilt repent and fly to the throne of grace,
to the end, that hauing obtained it, thou render him
thankes for the ſame, who in ſpeciall regard of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
ſheweth himſelfe wonderfull towardes vs, and
ſubmitting thy ſelfe to obey his truth, thou wilt goe on
in ſilence to glorifie him to the end. Loe here a little

               <head>CHAP. XVII. Conſolations againſt death, and how it ought to be
feared, or not feared.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E preſent now ſome conſolations to
the wiſe <hi>Vieillard,</hi> to ſtrengthen him
againſt death, and doe ſhew him
how he ought to feare or contemne
it: For in this point it is, that wiſe
men at laſt ſhew what they are. He
that hath not learned to die betimes,
can hardly die well, and for one that doth it, thouſands
lagg behinde where they periſh. Many according to
the ſaying of <hi>Cicero,</hi> thinke old age is miſerable, becauſe
it is ſo neere approching to death, which among the
moſt terrible things, being terrible to the children of
this world, for that it deſtroyes the ſtructure &amp; frame
of this mortall bodie, and endeth the life, which wee
keepe and maintaine with ſo much carking and caring:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3512:81"/>
We are not able to relate how great and many the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
be, which the apprehenſion of death cauſeth in
moſt perſons, which liue in the world, yea, euen in thoſe
men and women, which vnder the weight and burthen
of extreame anguiſhes and griefes deſire nothing more
then to be gone hence. This terror floweth from the
ſenſe and feeling of the wrath of God, and a bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
with which when wicked ones come to feele
themſelues tormented, they haue no reſt, nor can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
nothing elſe but euill for them in death. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we cannot too much allaude and commend the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Sineca</hi> in the Epiſtle 62. where he ſayth; before
I grew old I endeuoured and ſtudied to liue well: In
my old age I frame and diſpoſe my ſelfe to die well. It
is well ſpoken: For according to the counſell of Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his ſecond booke of Chriſtian doctrine;
he cannot die ill, who hath liued well, and hardly ſhall
any man whoſoeuer make a good end which hath lead
a wicked life. But they are groſſely deceiued, who
thinke that old men and none elſe, are lodged in deaths
quarter, and that they onely are preſt and obliged reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
to awaite and looke for him: Seeing that in all
places, and at all tymes he lyeth in waite for perſons of
all ages and ſexes, and ſayth vnto them, Stand, I take
thee priſoner by the great Kinges commandement:
packe hence away, come before thy Iudge. Death re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes
neither babe, young nor old, man nor woman,
rich nor poore, high nor low, ſtrong nor weake.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>The poore mans cottage built very low,</l>

                  <l>The rich mans Pallace high towring and ſtrong,</l>
                  <l>He ſhiuers in peeces, and layes it along.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Who knoweth not that warre and the peſtilence doth

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3512:81"/>
the life of man is nothing elſe but a road way to death
Wee came into the world vpon this condition, to goe
out of it. In this wee greatly erre and beguile our ſelues,
as many moſt learned Philoſophers and Diuines haue
long agoe ſpoken, that we looke vpon death afarre off,
and ſtill thinke him to bee a poore feeble impotent,
which marcheth with a ſlow pace, and is yet fiue or ſixe
thouſand dayes iourney behinde the weakeſt of our
troupe: not conſidering that death is on the threſhold
of our dores, yea, is our chamber-fellow, a gueſt at our
tables, and our bed-fellow too. Death hath alreadie
truſſed vp the faireſt and beſt part of our life, like a
Sergeant, which taking vs by the throate carries away
vnder his arme our money-bagges, our precious iewels,
and vpon his yeomens ſhoulders our curious houſhold
moueables. Not to wonder hereat, conſider (ſayd S.
<hi>Baſile</hi>) the changes and revolutions of ages. Doe wee
not obſerue how in three weeks of yeares three are dead?
Childhood is paſſed away, and all his fond and vaine
wiſhes haue left vs: As much may be ſaid of other parts
of our life. The caſe being ſo then that the meditation of
death belongeth to all perſons, and that nothing is ſo
miſerable as not to know to die, and that to feare death
is an euill more dreadfull then death it ſelfe, ſeeing alſo
that the proper force of faith, conſiſteth in this, not to
be afraid of death: It is meete now, ſomewhat the
more at large to treate of this poynt, and to ſhew what
other holy, and prophane Authors doe ſay therein to
our purpoſe, to wit, to remoue out of the heart, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
of euery wiſe old man, the too violent and raging
apprehenſion of death, and to ſtrengthen and fortifie
ſo well the minde, that it bee neuer diſmounted, or
throwne out of the ſeate of aſſurance, wherein it is ſetled
by the knowledge of the truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We will ſhew that euery one, eſpecially, our
<hi>Vieillard,</hi> ought continually to meditate vpon death, and
betimes to prouide and furniſh himſelfe with remedies,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3512:82"/>
againſt the affrightments and terros thereof. Secondly,
what death is: how many ſortes there are: what death
it is ought to be feared. Thirdly, for what reaſons the
Heathens haue ſo manfully contemned death. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
of the extreamities which muſt be avoyded, and of
the meane, that it is meete to keepe in all. Fiftly, the
defences and comfortes againſt death, the commodities
of it, and the great benefits which they reape by it, who
in young and old age make their recourſe to Ieſus
Chriſt, the food and drinke of eternall life. The two
firſt poynts ſhall be handled in this ſeauenteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the other three in the Chapter following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is reaſon that we ſhould betimes thinke vpon
death, and meditating thereon, we ſhould caſtour eye
vpon the freedome, life, immortalitie, and other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
which enſue it. For he giueth death a ioyfull well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
who before hand is prepared for it, and who
ſeeing him to come as at the beginning, is no more
moued and troubled thereat, then the paſſenger which
with a fauourable winde ſhould in ſhorter time make an
end of his ſayling. A certaine Auncient compared our
life to him which is ſet in a ſayling Ship: be he ſitting or
ſtanding he forwardes his way. So wee euery moment
make towardes death, in our waking, ſleeping, ſtanding
ſtill, or going. But it is meete to ſettle and invre our
mindes not to be too much affected, and to doate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this preſent life, not therein to lazie and houſe
them, as if it were their Countrie, but rather to thinke
that we are way faring perſons from the Manſion and
royall Pallace of our heauenly Father. Let our minds
then ſigh and groane in this Tabernacle; let them me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
vpon, and wiſh for that happie life, wherein all
corruption ſhall bee ſwallowed vp, leaſt it happen to
them as to thoſe inconſiderate perſons, who being
a long tyme growne lazie and idle in ſome incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
rude, and baſe Inne, cannot bee haled out
thence, whatſoeuer remonſtrance and counſell is giuen
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3512:82"/>
them. But on the contrary, let vs call to minde our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall,
and that wee are the ſonnes of the euerlaſting
King, that heauen is our countrey, that for a while wee
trot vp and downe in the earth, as little children which
are carryed out of cities into countrey villages there to
bee nurſſed vp, till there fathers and mothers ſend to
fetch them home. Let vs remember that wee are
poore paſſengers, and that after much running vp
and downe, wee muſt returne home to our dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and ſettle our ſelues in ſome certaine place: leaſt
our hearts make a ſtay and demurre at the things wee
behold with our eyes, and which haue ſome appearance
to deceiue and detaine them.</p>
               <p>Let vs take great heed of being deſirous to dwell,
and to rott and ſtincke in the cloſe and darke denne
of our body, and this preſent life, which is nothing
elſe but a horrid pryſon of infinite temptations, cares,
carckings and dangers, where pleaſure is vnpleaſing,
where our ioy is vnſure, where wee are tortured with
feare, ſcroched with luſt and concupiſcence, waſted with
ſorrow and griefe. Let our ſoule be daily couerſant in
heauen, let our heart be where our treaſure is: By this
meanes wee ſhall eaſily contemne all things that bee
earthly, tranſitory and periſhing. Whoſoeuer doth
daily thinke that hee is mortall, (and the <hi>Vieillard</hi>
ought to thinke on it more then any other) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſeth
that which hee ſees preſent, and makes haſt
to thoſe happineſſes, which are future and to come. I
know no better meanes for our ſerious conuerſion
to God, and to inioy perfect comfort, then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the end of our race in the world,
and the meditation of death. This is a powerfull
doctrine to draw vs out of the ſwallowes and
gulfes of intemperance, impatience, and all riots
and exceſſe.</p>
               <p>Let vs remember our Creator in the dayes of our
youth, before old age and death intrappe and ſeize on
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3512:83"/>
vs: Let the end of our actions and affayres bee before
our eyes, to containe vs in our obedience to God.
When death is betweene our teeth, it is too late to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
remedies againſt the terrours thereof. He is vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed
who thinkes to caſt out his lading, when his ſhip
is all leakie, &amp; takes in water on all ſides. It is no time to
make prouiſion for a voyage, when men are put forth
and forward at Sea. Hee deceiues himſelfe who ſeekes
preſeruatiues, when the peſtilence is ſpread all ouer the
body, and hath ſeized the heart; The fooliſh Virgines
bethought themſelues vnſeaſonably to ſeeke oyle for
their Lampes, when the ſpouſe was entred and the gate
ſhut. But our Lord hath willed that the day of our
death ſhould be vnknowne vnto vs; ſo much the more
to diſpoſe vs to waite for it, following the example of
thoſe faithfull ſeruants, who not knowing the houre of
their maſters returne, ſtand vpon their guard carefully
watching. Such ſeruants are wiſe. But the ſlothfull, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
riotous, who make ſpoyle and hauocke of all in
the houſe without care of their maſter, are miſcheeuous
and vnluckie. <hi>Plato</hi> writeth in his firſt booke of his
Common-weale, That when any one is come to this
point, to thinke that he ought to die out of hand, and
yet is ſo heedleſſe that death doth ſurprize him, hee ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
falleth into griefes, frightes, diſpaires, horrors,
for not hauing in his life kept reckoning of thoſe things,
which hee ought maturely and betimes to conſider of.
Wee adde, that this is wholly neceſſary, by ſomuch the
more as we are to render our account, before the in eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
throne of the eternall Father of that great family,
which muſt appeare before him. Verily the meditation
of death is not irkſome, anxious, perplexing, nor ought
we to deferre it from one yeare or age to another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſottiſh opinion of the vulgar: But cleane
contrary to thinke, that nothing doth ſafeguard or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
vs ſo much in the middeſt of aduerſities and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
as ſuch meditation. It is that which makes vs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3512:83"/>
in proſperitie; preſt, ready, and prepared in all
euents. Alſo as (Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayd to the people of
<hi>Thibara</hi>) wee weare not enrolled by Baptiſme among
Chriſtian Souldiers, to thinke that we ought to doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe in the world, then there to ſeeke and hunt
after our pleaſures and eaſe, turning our backes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictes,
woundes, death. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth in the
fifth Chapter of his thirteenth Booke, <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi>
That faith would vtterly bee weakened; if preſently
after our Baptiſme, we ſhould become immortall, and
ſhould be crowned before we had fought.</p>
               <p>2. Let vs ſee in the ſecond place, what death is, how
many kindes there are, and how it ought to bee feared
and contemned. Life and death (according to <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>)
are common accidents to all liuing creatures, for
that the reaſon of originall and corruptible matter doth
ſo beare, mainetaine, and require it. Touching the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the firſt man, and how hee had euer liued, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
in his obedience to God, wee haue formerly
ſpoken of it in the diſcourſe of the tree of life. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
as the condition of man, created after Gods
image, who kindly receiued him into his alliance, was
excellent: By ſo much the more miſerable, dreadfull, and
terrible, is the death into which hee fell after his reuolt,
then the death of other liuing creatures, whoſe ſoule dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with the body, and who after this annihilation
feare no torment whatſoeuer. But wee ſpeake heere of
the death of man, which God cauſed not, for hee alſo
taketh no pleaſure in the death of any, but rather in the
conuerſion, good, and ſaluation of vs all. This doth
not impugne, but that God is a iuſt Iudge, puniſhing
ſinnes, and ſuffering no miſdeedes and tranſgreſſions
vnpuniſhed, but bringing all things to their endes by
miraculous meanes, wherein his wiſedome doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
appeare, although very often the inſtruments,
which hee vſeth to execute his iuſt iudgements, may
haue foule crimes and groſſe faults. In this ſence it is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3512:84"/>
ſayd; That God woundeth, killeth, whetteth his ſword,
that he bringeth to ruine, that hee caſteth the body and
ſoule into hell, and that hee ſendeth the wicked into
euerlaſting fire. So then, God hath not made death, but
death is crept, and entred into the world thorough the
diuells enuy, and malice, and mans diſobedience. Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> in a certaine place ſayth, That if God had
made death, hee would not with teares haue bewayled
dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom therefore hee rayſed and reſtored
to life, that the diuell might ſee, that it is but loſt labour
with ſuch rage and fury, to purſue the children of God
to take them out of the world, foraſmuch as thoſe
whom we deeme vtterly loſt and deſtroyed, doe liue
vnto God.</p>
               <p>Touching their errour, who held that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould
haue dyed, though he had not ſinned: Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
anſwereth, That all Chriſtians are to hold this point
for firme and vndoubted, that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> were
created ſuch, that if they had reiected the counſell of the
ſeducer, who ſpake by the Serpent, continuing in the
free liberty wherein they were, they had enioyed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life and not dyed: But making no reckoning of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying
God their Lord, and abuſing their free will,
prone and ready to yeeld to the ſuggeſtions of Sathan,
and their owne luſtes and concupiſcences, ſo, as they
very ſoone felt the effect of the threatning denounced
to them both: <hi>In that day that thou ſhalt cate of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fruit, thou ſhalt die the death.</hi> Before his fall the firſt
man was mortall, as touching the condition of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
immortall by the good pleaſure of his Creator: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſinne hee could not dye. But by the redemption of
Chriſt Ieſus, the elect of God ſhall obtaine in the life
eternall, euen the ſame priuiledge that the holy Angells,
not to be able to fall from the ſtate of grace, nor to dye.
And as touching this point, that our father <hi>Adam</hi> dyed
not ſo ſoone as he had obeyed the voyce of <hi>Eue,</hi> it doth
derogate nothing from the truth of the ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3512:84"/>
againſt him, nor from the haynouſneſſe of his
ſinne: For the ſence and meaning of the threatning,
<hi>Thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> is as if God ſayd, certainely thou
ſhalt be ſubiect to the firſt death, which is a ſeparation of
the ſoule from the body, and to the ſecond death, a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
puniſhment, foraſmuch as it is an euerlaſting ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from God, from the light of heauen, from ioy
vnſpeakeable, from the life which is bleſſed for euer. If
then it be demaunded, how can it bee, that <hi>Adam</hi> liued
after his reuolt and falling away; <hi>Gregorie</hi> the great, doth
ſufficiently to the purpoſe make anſwere, in his 145.
Epiſtle of his fifth Booke: that death in two kindes ſteps
in and ſeizeth vpon vs; eyther by the priuation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of life, or by the quality of life. In regard of the
firſt kinde of death, <hi>Adam</hi> dyed not ſo ſoone, but rather
as touching the ſecond: For preſently after his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
being depriued of happineſſe, of the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
of contentment of minde, of a ſtrong ſound
conſtitution of body, hee felt himſelfe couered with
ſhame, horrors, ſorrow, with ſundry miſeries, knew
himſelfe to be aliue in paine vnder the curſe of his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
who was created by Gods fauour to liue in an
excellent eſtate, and perpetuall quiet, and tranquility of
minde.</p>
               <p>Some thinke that wee meddle and goe too farre, to
ſay, that man tranſgreſſing in time, was pronounced
guilty of temporall and eternall death. The Iewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched
with the like errour doe dreame, that they haue
no need of a <hi>Meſſias</hi> to aboliſh and take away ſinne,
and to deliuer from eternall death. This errour did
grow from the ignorance of the definition of ſinne, as
alſo of the ſoueraigne and infinite Maieſtie of God,
whom man had offended by his tranſgreſſion. For, ſin
being a reuolt and falling away from God to ioyne and
cleaue to the diuell, and a tranſgreſſion of the holy law
in diſpite of God, man ſinning could not eſcape eternall
perdition and puniſhment, but by the grace of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3512:85"/>
as by obedience hee had kept his Creators fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
for euer. Euen ſo then, as it is not iniuſtice (as Saint
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, in the 11. Booke, <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi>
Chap 11.) If Magiſtrates capitally puniſhing many
haynous crimes and offences, doe baniſh for euer the
malefactors from humane ſociety: Who ſhall dare to
ſay, that it is iniquity in God, the Lord of the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and durable City, if he eternally baniſh out of his
kingdome of glory, his ſworne enemies the wicked,
who continually offend him; And the polluted, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
vniuſt, reprobates, who plot and conſpire againſt
God, and their neighbours, remaine for euer vnder the
wrath and curſe of the Lord? For iuſtification of all,
conſider onely the corruption of humane nature, and
what the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are in themſelues. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
the beleefe, touching the immortality of mans
ſoule, be orthodox and moſt true, yet may it fitly bee
ſayd, that the ſoule is ſubiect to a certaine kind of death.
Wee call it immortall, becauſe it ceaſeth not to liue, and
in ſome ſort to haue ſence and feeling. The body is
mortall, becauſe it may bee depriued of life, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtes
in the reſidence of the ſoule in it, from whence
floweth that which doth maintaine it, not liuing of it
ſelfe, but by the ſoule which doth gouerne and mooue
it. But the death of the ſoule is, when God doth aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
it, and depriue it of his grace: And wee ſay, that
man is vtterly dead, when the ſoule is quite gone out
of the body, and that God doth abandon the ſoule
finally adiudged to euerlaſting torments. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>
will, that the name of death bee deriued from the veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
morſure, or ſting of the infernall ſerpent the diuel,
then by him brought into the world, when hee firſt bit
and ſtung out firſt mother <hi>Eue,</hi> leauing faſt ſticking in
vs the ſting of ſinne, which the Apoſtle calleth the ſting
of death. This ſting being blunted and taken away,
death ceaſeth mortally to ſting vs. When S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
writeth (in his Treatiſe of the benefit of death, Chap. 1.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3512:85"/>
&amp; 2.) that death hurteth not the ſoule, conſequently is
not euill; ſeeing that nothing but ſinne hurteth the
ſoule, it is to bee vnderſtood of the bodily death in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of Gods children. Therefore hee maketh a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
diſtinction of death, the one good, the other euill,
the third good or euill. The good is the myſticall death,
when a man dyeth to ſinne and liueth to God, whereof
the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, That we are buried with Chriſt
Ieſus into his death by Baptiſme. The euill is the death
of ſinne, whereof it is written, Then ſoule that ſinneth
ſhall dye. And the third is the end of our race and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in this world, that is, the ſeparation of the ſoule
from the body; of good men accounted good, of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men euill. Although death doth vnſhackle and ſet
all perſons at liberty; very few yet are to bee found,
which take pleaſure therein: But this proceedeth not
from any offence that is in death, that is, in the ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the ſoule from the body, but from the infirmity of
mortall men, who ſuffering themſelues to goe on in
their carnall pleaſures and delights of this life, doe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and feare to ſee themſelues at the end of their race in
the earth, louing long life, there to liue euilly, that is,
there to dye hourely. O how ſweet is the good death
to wiſe old men, to men and women who are the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God, who watch, who pray, who cry to their
Lord in repentance, in faith, and charity, who manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fight againſt all temptations. And how bitter is the
euill death to thoſe euill ſoules, vnbeleeuers, ſtiffe nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ones, hypocrites, who wrap themſelues in their
ſinnes, who haue no pleaſure, hope, nor comfort, but in
this world.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being ſo, it is eaſie to ſhew how death is
to be feared or not. Certainely, the death of ſinners is
euill, who not content to be borne in ſinne, liue ſtill in
all manner of iniquities. But the death of the Saints is
precious, being the end of their labours and toyles, the
conſeruation and <hi>cuſtos</hi> of their victory; the doore of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3512:86"/>
life, and the entrance into an aſſured, perfect, glorious
reſt. Thoſe are to bee bewayled in their death, who
haue hell for their priſon: But it beſeemes vs to reioyce
and bee glad at their departure, whom God doth bid
welcome into his heauenly Palace, where they magnifie
him for euer. If any one aske vs (ſayth <hi>Lactantius,</hi> in the
third Booke of his Chriſtian Inſtitutions) whether
death be good or euill? wee will anſwere, that the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
thereof doth conſiſt in the conſideration of life in
it ſelfe. Death in it ſelfe cannot bee ſayd to bee good,
pleaſing and to be deſired, on the contrary, it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of nature, and the reward of ſinne. But wee
muſt eſteeme it a thing worthy great prayſe, pleaſing,
and full of grace and delight, when wee dye ioyfully in
the true knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus, to goe out of the
priſon of this mortall body, out of this valley of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
out of this deſart where we are exiled perſons, to
returne to our Father, our countrey and heauenly city.
He dyeth well, who with the Apoſtle ſayth in ſincerity
of conſcience, all my deſire is to depart hence, and to
bee with Chriſt Ieſus: Particularly, as touching
my ſelfe, I haue fought the good fight, I haue finiſhed
my courſe, I haue kept the faith, alſo the crowne of
righteouſneſſe is layd vp and reſerued for mee, which
the Lord, the iuſt Iudge ſhall in that day giue vnto me;
not to me onely, but to thoſe who loue his appearing.
Againe, death and the remembrance and apprehenſion
of it, is wonderfull irkeſome, and bitter to a man which
truſteth in his riches, liuing in all eaſe, in full ſtrength of
body and proſperity.</p>
               <p>Here we demand, what we are to judge of the death
of thoſe, who are cruelly quartered and diſmembred by
hangmen, or by fierce and wilde beaſtes, are ſwallowed
vp in the belly of fiſhes, are ſtifled with a ſuddaine apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie,
are bereaued of wit, ſenſe, and reaſon, by ſome
hot burning feaver, or who die franticke, and madd?
As for thoſe who are put to cruell death for the name of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3512:86"/>
Chriſt Ieſus, the anſwere is that their death cannot bee
tearmed and accompted but deare and precious in the
ſight of the Lord, and of all his Church. For if the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Philoſophers haue had ſome reaſon to ſay, that a
vertuous man, leaues not to be happie, though he bee
put to a violent death; why ſhould we not ſay the ſame
of the true vertuous, to wit, the holy Martyrs, ſeeing we
haue ſo certaine teſtimonies, and ſo many famous exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of their faith, charitie, patience, and conſtancie in
death? The Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> is herein expreſſe:
for it conteyneth the heroicall trophies of faith, alſo the
opprobries, diſgracefull reuilings, and cruell torments
of the invincicible Champions of Chriſt Ieſus. But I
pray you what torments can diſmay, and terrifie him
which glorieth in the croſſe of Chriſt Ieſus, among all
others a ſhamefull and terrible torment and death. <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
obſerueth in his <hi>Apologetico,</hi> that in his tyme
Chriſtians were called <hi>Sarmentitij</hi> &amp; <hi>Semiſsij</hi> baviniſtes,
and poore ſnakes, becauſe they were bound to a ſtake,
which coſt but ſix Liards, three halfe pence, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
and there were burned with faggotts of reedes,
or bruſh wood, which were ſet round about them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
ſayth he our equipage, our munition, and armour
of victorie; this is out triumphall Chariot. <hi>Euſebius</hi>
writeth in the fiftie booke of his Hiſtorie, of a holy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr
burned aliue with certaine plates of iron made red
hot, and ſet to his naked bodie; notwithſtanding which
tormentes hee made a conſtant profeſſion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
faith, even to the laſt gaſpe. <hi>Euſebius</hi> addeth, that
this ſheweth that nothing is terrible to him, which feeles
that God loueth him, and that whoſoeuer ſeekes the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Chriſt Ieſus is guarded, and ſaued harmeleſſe from
euery painefull, and terrible accident and caſuall event.
As for the vncouth and ſtrange diſeaſes, and kindes of
hideous death, whereunto to mans life is expoſed, as they
are to be ſeene in the horrible convulſions of Epilepſies
&amp; falling ſickneſſes, in the violent fittes of Apoplexies,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3512:87"/>
in cruell, and hot burning feavers; theſe are pittifull ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to behold, and incident to our fraile and ſinnefull
nature: But they are alſo certaine monitors of a better
life, ſeeing that our health, and happineſſe conſiſteth
not in a ſound temperature of humours, but in this that
our names are written in heauen, and that wee haue bin
dedicated to Ieſus Chriſt. For the Lord God who
knoweth our heartes, who in his ſecret judgement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth
ſome more then others, regardes and conſiders
what he hath done for vs, and what the holy Ghoſt,
who comforteth vs in ſuch accidents and caſes, doth
for vs by vnſpeakeable groanings; not the intempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our bodies, nor the effectes of it. For this is an
aſſured thing, that there is no condemnation to thoſe
that are in Chriſt Ieſus, and that nothing is able to ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
vs from the loue, which the father of heauen beares
vs for his ſonnes ſake: yea, that all things doe helpe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for the good of thoſe, whom according to his
determinate counſell he hath called to the participation
of his grace. Therefore all Chriſtians ought to remaine
vndoubted and reſolued in this poynt, that there is no
kinde of maladie, torment, or death, which doth hurt
Gods elect: that there is no death, happie, ioyful, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the wicked, vnbeleeuers, and miſcreants, whom
God often times for a while doth vphold in this world,
to the end, more heauily to puniſh them, after hee hath
dragged and haled them out of the earth.</p>
               <p>Hereupon it will be demanded, wherefore then ſo
many great perſonages, members of the Church of
God, and Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe the head thereof, did
feare death, and prayed to be guarded and ſecured from
it?</p>
               <p>I anſwere, that there was ſomething of ſingular note
in our Lord, and which muſt be differenced and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
from others; In that he not onely bore and felt
a common death, or ſeperation of the ſoule from the
bodie, but alſo vnder-went and ſuſtayned the wrath of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:3512:87"/>
God, and all the torments and agonies, that may be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined,
without ſinne notwithſtanding, becauſe hee
was an hoſtage and pledge for vs: Neuertheleſſe, in ſuch
ſort, that he did not yeeld nor ſhrinke vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
nor murmured a whit againſt God, but volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
offred himſelfe in ſacrifice, ſtood not demurring,
and ſhifting of death with natures delayes, wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
himſelfe to the will of God his Father, as it was
foretold and figured by <hi>Dauid</hi> in the fortieth Pſalme,
Here am I O God, that I may doe thy will. Behold, as
touching the head of the Church, who had had no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
of combat and victorie, if he had not felt the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
and terrors of death, without ſinne, or any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and fault on his part. In reſpect then we are his
members, let vs keepe and obſerue this rule: That wee
cannot commend euery refuſal, or euery deſire of death,
nor diſcommend all contempt of death. Some wiſh
death not ſo much for any deſire they haue of a better
life, as for the deſpite and diſlike they conceiue againſt
their abode and ſtay in the world, where they ſee miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which their weake mindes cannot brooke and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
and which giue terrible ſhockes and aſſaults to the
moſt reſolued and ſtouteſt hearts. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> wanting
bread in the wilderneſſe, wiſhed death; as alſo when
newes was brought them, that the <hi>Cananites</hi> were men
of a very tall ſtature. <hi>Iob</hi> in the depth of his panges and
griefes deſired to die; as alſo the Prophet <hi>Eliah</hi> did, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his eſcape in the Deſert. On the contrary <hi>Dauid,
Ezechias,</hi> and other great perſonages very much feared
death, and inſtantly beſought the Lord to guard and
ſaue them from it. But this was for a ſpeciall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to wit, in as much as they being afraide of the
threatninges and judgements of God, the approach of
death appeared more terrible vnto them; or, becauſe
they wiſhed to continue longer to aduance Gods glory,
and to yeeld their helpe and ſeruice to the edification
of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:3512:88"/>
Againe, the ſame perſonages baniſhed all feare from
them, looking vpon death, according as now it is made
vnto vs (by the grace of God) the reſt from our labours,
&amp; the paſſage to a better life. In this ſenſe the Patriarch
<hi>Iob</hi> ſpake in the 19. Chapter, I know that my redeemer
liueth, and that I ſhall riſe againe at the laſt day, that I
ſhall be againe cloathed with my skin, and ſhall ſee the
Lord in my fleſh. So <hi>Dauid</hi> did ſing in the 16. Pſalme.
For this cauſe my heart is glad, my tongue reioyceth;
Moreouer, my fleſh reſteth in aſſurance, for thou wilt
not leaue my ſoule in the graue. And in the 23. Pſalme,
Though I ſhould walke in the ſhadow of death, I will
feare no euill, becauſe thou art with me.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F there be any men bound to meditate
ordinarily vpon death, to be armed
with remedies againſt the alarumes of
it, to procure that their children,
friends, and families doe liue as preſt
and readie to die, wiſe old men are
eſpecially they, whoſe true Philoſophie is called the
Meditation of death. To draw them ſo much the more
eaſily vnto it, we will remember to euery one of them
ſome ſayings of wiſe Pagans and Heathens, which will
cauſe vs to ſay to all perſons, who vaunt themſelues of
the name of Chriſtians; At leaſt doe not afflict and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
your ſelues more with the death of the your ſelues and
yours then the ſilly Heathens, who had no hope, who
ſo manfully contemned the approches of death, who
with ſo great conſtancie haue embraced it, and ſtriuen
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:3512:88"/>
againſt it. I ſpeake thus conſidering the cowardize of
ſome Chriſtians, who haue nothing ſo much in their
mouthes, and take ſo little to heart, as death. S. <hi>Ierome</hi>
in the Epiſtle to <hi>Heliodorus</hi> ſhewing, how we ought to
be more reſolute againſt the aſſaults of death, and all
accidents and caſualties of humaine life, then Infidells
were, maketh mention of <hi>Xerxes</hi> that mightie Monarch,
who ouerthrew mountaines, and paved the Sea with
Shipps. This Monarch conſidering from the toppe of
a hill many millions of men at his ſeruice in warres, fell
a weeping, that at the end of a hundred yeares, not one
of them ſhould be aliue. And if we loue (added he) this
advantage to be mounted vpon ſo high a watch Tower,
that from thence we may behold all the earth vnder our
feete, and ſo many kingdomes fallen to ruine; alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
liuing men, ſome tortured, others ſtrangled, and
drowned; on the one ſide feſtiualles, on the other ſide
funeralles; ſome to be borne, others to die: To what
ſtraight and exigent ſhould we be brought, if wee were
not aſſured that all theſe things are ordered by the juſt
appoyntment of the All-mightie. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the creation of the world, ſayth, that all men
are borne and die naked, that there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the bodies of poore men and rich, but that the
bodies of rich-men being very purſie, well fed and fat
while they liue, are more puant and ſtinking then the
bodies of poore men.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe helpes and ſupports againſt death, which
the Heathens haue collected from our condition to be
borne and to die they haue from thence collected other
cauſes, which we are now to diſcuſſe and examine, and
whereof <hi>Ciceco</hi> ſpeaketh in his Dialogue of old age, as
followeth. We know how chearefully and manfully
ſouldiers contemne death; why then ſhould wiſe old
men feare it? To haue our fill of all things cauſeth that
we haue our fill and ſatietie of life. Thoſe who die well,
liue a life which alone deſerueth the name: but ſo long
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:3512:89"/>
as we are locked vp in the priſon of the bodie, wee are
as it were plunged deepe in the earth, and exiled very
farre from, and beneath our heauenly Manſion. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all wiſe men die willingly, fooles on the contrarie
leaue this world againſt their will, mauger their teeth,
or in brutiſh ignorance. <hi>Socrates</hi> the laſt day of his death
diſcourſed of the immortalitie of the ſoule. <hi>Cyrus</hi> a little
before his death ſayd to his ſonnes, Doe not thinke
that after I ſhall be dead, I am annihilated and brought
to nothing. If ſome god (ſaid <hi>Cato</hi> in the ſame Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue)
would permit me to returne from old age to
childhood, and to cry in a Cradle, I ſhould forbeare to
accept ſuch a condition, nor would I for any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to the beginning of my race, hauing almoſt fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
it. For what commoditie is found in a life toſſed to
and fro with turmoyles and toyles, as this preſent life
is? Notwithſtanding, I will not bewayle it, nor doe I
repent me to haue liued, I which goe out of this world
as out of an Inne, not as out of a houſe, ſeeing nature
hath giuen vs a cabbin here of ingreſſe and egreſſe, but
not to ſtay and continue. O how glorious will that
day be, wherein I ſhall be found in the holy aſſembly of
ſoules, and ſhall goe to heauen.</p>
               <p>Certainely, Old age is the end and Epilogue of our
life, even as of ſome Comedie or Interlude. Loe here
ſome ſayings of <hi>Cicero</hi> in the fore-mentioned dialogue.
In the firſt Booke of his <hi>Tuſculane</hi> queſtions, wherein
he expreſſely treateth of the contempt of death, among
other his ſayinges and diſcourſes, we reade that among
the old Latines, whom the Poet <hi>Ennius</hi> calleth <hi>Caſcj,</hi>
that it was a doctrine held from Father to Sonne, that
death did not aboliſh man, ſo as it might be ſayd he was
vtterly periſhed. The ſages would not haue ſet out and
adorned their funerals, ſepulchers, and tombes with ſuch
ceremonies, nor hallowed them with ſo many devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if they had certainely held that death is an vtter
deſtruction of the whole man: on the contrarie they
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3512:89"/>
were in this poynt perſwaded, that it was a departure
and change of life, which brought worthie men and
women to heauen. <hi>Plato</hi> alſo bringeth in <hi>Socrates</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to death, ſaying to his judges, I hope that good
ſhall befall me to die; For if all ſenſe and feeling be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed
in death, it bringeth a quiet and perpetuall reſt,
but if that which is ſaid of it be found true, that it is a
departure out of this world to goe into places where
thoſe that be dead are aſſembled together, what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
ſhall it be to me, to talke and diſcourſe with
them? It is further (addeth <hi>Cicero</hi>) a ſound and ſolid
Argument, that nature it ſelfe proclaimes the ſoules of
men to be immortall, in this, that all men haue a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
care, what ſhall become of them and all thinges
elſe after their death, and die very willingly, when life
beginning to faile and to leaue them, may ſtay and ſettle
it ſelfe vpon a good conſcience, and a worthie euidence
to it ſelfe. In the ſecond Booke of the Lawes theſe
words following are read; Our aunceſtors haue ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that the dead ſhould bee canonized, and placed in
the number of gods, by certaine ceremonies which they
did inſtitute. <hi>Ennius</hi> as of opinion that wee were not
to weepe for the dead, becauſe their ſoules were immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
<hi>Plato</hi> ſayd in the firſt Booke of his Common weale,
that a man which hath this good teſtimonie in himſelfe,
to haue done no man wrong, is alwayes vpheld with a
greacious and ſtedfaſt hope, the good nurſſe and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe
of his old age.</p>
               <p>And againe, <hi>Cicero</hi> in his firſt Booke of <hi>Tuſculane</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions,
writeth theſe words; You haue in ſleepe the
image of death, wherein you are ſheeted and wrapped
vp euery night. Are you in doubt then that there is no
more ſenſe in death, ſeeing you know that in ſleepe the
ſoule of man is never at reſt? Moreouer, baniſh farre
from you thoſe old wiues fables and comptes, that it is
a great miſerie to die before the time. And of what
time? Of Nature? But nature hath lent vs life as ſiluer
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3512:90"/>
or coyne, without ſetting vs a day of reſtitution, but to
reſtore it backe againe at her will and pleaſure. Why
then doe you complaine, if ſhee call for and demand
her owne againe, when it pleaſeth her, ſeeing you hold
and haue it vpon this condition? With what alacritie
and chearefulneſſe ought we to goe that way, at which
wayes end we ſhall be releaſed and diſcharged of all
carefull carkinges, faſcheries, and anxieties of minde.</p>
               <p>A woman of <hi>Sparta</hi> hauing ſent her ſonne to the

                  <hi>Seneca</hi> an excellent Stoicke Philoſopher hath verie
worthie precepts, in his morall Bookes, touching death.
We could compile a great Booke of them, but not to be
too long &amp; too large, it ſhall ſuffice vs to cull out ſome
ſentences of them, which ſhall be able to giue the reader
a taſte, and deſire to ſee the reſt. I will beginne at the
end of the thirteenth Epiſtle, which ſpeaketh to old
men. Among other euills folly hath yet this one, that
ſhee ſtill begins to liue. This poynt ſheweth how bad
and ſcurrilous the levitie and giddie humour of men is,
who euery day lay new foundations of their life, and
beginne to build and raiſe hopes, when it behooues
them to goe out of the world. You ſhall ſee old men,
who runne themſelues out of breath after honors, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fittes,
and tranſitorie goods. But can there bee a more
vnſightly, and vnſeemely thing ſeene, then an old man
to become a childe againe? In the two and twentith
Epiſtle: Is it not a great ſhame to bee afraid, when wee
are to enter into a Pallace of aſſurance and ſafetie? The
reaſon is, that we are diſpoſſeſſed and turned out of all
the goods after which we doe ſigh, and painefully toyle
at the end of our life, whereof not any portion or part
remaines vnto vs, all being gone and loſt. There is no
man which takes care to liue well, but to liue long, &amp; yet
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3512:90"/>
all men may be able to attaine to this good, to liue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly,
but no man can or ought to promiſe himſelfe
long life. We doe adde: And the old man, which now
hath no more to do with the things of this life, that are
common to all, is ſo ill aduiſed, that he thinketh not of
the amendment of his life, nor of the boxe and blowe
which death ſhall ſuddenly giue him on the eare. At
the very end of the three and twentith Epiſtle; There
are ſome, who begin to liue, when they muſt dye, and
there are ſome, who are dead, before they haue begun to
liue. In the thirtith Epiſtle, As little wiſe is hee who
feareth death, as the young man who feareth to bee old.
For as old age doth kicke and ſpurre young age, in like
ſort doth death old age. Hee which will not dye, hath
no will to liue, becauſe life was giuen with this excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That we muſt die. Wee are in the way of death,
and who feareth it is out of his wits, ſeeing we expect
that which is certaine, and feare that which is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
At the end of the two and thirtith Epiſtle. He is
free and his owne man, who liueth as if hee had no
longer to liue. And at the end of the ſixe and thirtith
Epiſtle, Neither little infants, nor young boyes, nor
madde men feare death; it is then a great ſhame, if rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
doe not as much confirme and aſſure vs, as ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and ſottiſhneſſe doth them. At the end of the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
and ſeuenteenth Epiſtle: It is with our life, as with
a Comedie, it skils not how long it be, ſo it bee well
acted. Take no care where the end of your race ſhall
be, make a ſtop and a ſtay, where neceſſity enforceth
you, prouided you make a good end. In the nintith
three Epiſtle. Let vs take order, that as gold and other
things of excellent price and worth; ſo our life be not
of a great length, neuertheleſſe that it weigh much: Let
vs not meaſure it by our time, but by our worke. Will
you know a very good reſpite of yeares, it is to liue till
we be wiſe. He that is come ſo farre, though hee haue
not attayned to a great number of yeares, hath ſeene the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3512:91"/>
greater and better part of them. The nintith nine Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
containeth ſundry conſolations in death, which I
will briefly ſet downe. It is a fond and childiſh part to
giue the reynes to ſorrow, and to make account of an
vncertaine thing as our life is. He doth ill who weepes
vpon cuſtome, and ſeeing that ſorrow doth make vs
forget the bleſſings and benefits receiued of God, wee
muſt betimes ſhake off, and rid our ſelues of it, to the
end to call to minde the vertue of our departed friends,
and to make our vſe of it, and of them, as if they were
preſent. Wee ought to follow the example of thoſe,
who haue ſhewed themſelues vnmoued at the death of
their friendes, to thinke we ſhall follow the dead, whom
we haue not loſt, but giuen vp vnto God, who are gone
but a little before vs: It is the way of the world, our life
doth ſo manifeſt it: wee haue aſſurance of nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heauen, but of death, and our life is ſhort though it
containe many ages: It is croſſed and wounded with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
miſeries, which end in death freeing it of malice,
and of errour and ignorance. Conſequently, he which
is accuſtomed to grieue much, depriueth himſelfe of
comfort, to remedy which, and in ſtead of imitating the
fond cuſtomes of the ignorant and vulgar, hee muſt
ſhew himſelfe a man of courage, in the moſt violent
ſhockes and aſſaults of aduerſitie, ſetting before our
eyes the worthy deportments and behauiours of thoſe
which goe before vs, keeping a meaſure betweene ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and forgetfulneſſe, of thoſe whom wee haue made
much on, and beene kind and friendly vnto in the
world, and whom we ſee no more, and when they are
at peace and reſt, we are to giue ouer to grieue and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for them. I reaſcend to the nintith one Epiſtle,
from whence I will deduce that which followes. Doe
not meaſure vs by our Tombes, and Monuments,
which ſeeme to note ſome way differing betweene
ſome and others. The graue wherein our bodies are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
to duſt, makes vs all equall. Wee are borne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3512:91"/>
but death makes vs all equall. The Soueraigne
Law-giuer hath not differenced vs by our nobilitie, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
blood, and greatneſſe, but in this life: but when
death commeth, hee ſayth to this worldly greatneſſe,
Begon; I will that there bee the ſame law to all liuing
things vpon earth. Wee are all ſubiect to all ſorts of
euills. One is no more frayle, nor more aſſured to liue
till to morrow then another. In the hundreth and one
Epiſtle: There is no day nor houre, which doth not
point out vnto vs our vanity, and which by ſome new
experiment and tryall, doth not remember vs of our
frailty, which we tread vnder our feet, and which doth
not compell euery one of vs, who build and deuiſe end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
plots and deſignes, to haue an eye vnto death. From
the hundred and ſeuenth Epiſtle, I will make this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction;
It is good to beare that which we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
&amp; to follow without murmuring or complaining
that great God, by whoſe prouidence all things come
to paſſe. A bad Souldier is hee, who followes his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
vnwillingly. Let death finde vs preſt, forward, and
cheerefull. The heat which doth reſolutely conſigne
and yeeld it ſelfe into the hands of God, is euery way
great. On the contrary, he is a luske, coward, and
baſely bred fellow, who ſpurnes, kickes, and winſes,
who complaines of the gouernment of the world, and
who had rather cenſure God, then himſelfe. In the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twentith Epiſtle: A man is neuer more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
minded, then when he thinketh vpon his owne
frailty, and knowes and acknowledgeth that he is borne
to dye: Alſo that his body is not a houſe, but an Inne,
and for a while: It is a folly for vs to feare the laſt dayes
of our life, ſeeing our firſt dayes are tributarries, and
owe as much vnto death as our laſt. The laſt day of our
race makes vs to touch death, all the other doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
it. Death doth not violently lay hands vpon vs,
but gently laies hold on vs. Wherefore a vertuous ſoule,
feeling it ſelfe called to the participation of a greater
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3512:92"/>
happineſſe, endeuoureth to carry and behaue it ſelfe,
honeſtly and wiſely in this earthly Sentinell and Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
accounting none of thoſe things to be hers, which
doe hemme her in on euery ſide; but ſerues her turne
with them, as with borrowed mooueables, remembring
her ſelfe that ſhee doth but goe a iourney, and in poſt
haſt. There are many other ſentences of <hi>Seneca,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the benefit of death, in his Conſolations to <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>
and <hi>Marcia,</hi> as alſo in his other Treatiſes. But we
will make this extract no longer, leaſt ſo wee trouble
and offend with long reading impatient and froward
old men.</p>
               <p>4. Fourthly, wee ſpeake now of the extreamities
that muſt be auoyded, when there is queſtion of death,
to wit, Too great confidence, or raſhnes, or rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane,
or barbarous ſtupidity and ſenceleſneſſe; then
the too great apprehenſion, feare, and paine of death.
Of a truth our Creator and Soueraigne Lord, hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
vs with this fauourable gift and graunt, that our
hearts are of fleſh, not of ſtone or iron, to bee eaſily tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with the ſence of our miſeries, and the miſeries of
others. How ſhould we apprehend the mercy of God,
if we had not an apprehenſion of our miſeries? And
what feare of God, and of his iudgements would there
be in the world, if we ſhould not feare death, and other
puniſhments which he doth mitigate, and vſually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
into wholſome remedies to perſons, who mourne
vnder the burthen of their ſinnes, and with a repentant
heart, craue and implore the grace of their heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Wee are not willing to approoue the practiſe of
thoſe too auſtere <hi>Thracian</hi> Elders, who wept at the birth
day of their children, and made great cheere &amp; merrily
banquetted at the funeral of them that died. Much leſſe
doe we purpoſe to diſpute of death, as <hi>Hegeſias</hi> of <hi>Cyrena,</hi>
whom the King of <hi>AEgypt</hi> prohibited to diſcourſe any
more of death, becauſe many who heard him; killed
themſelues. No more doe we approoue thoſe mad men,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3512:92"/>
ſuch as were in times paſt, certaine ſurnamed, <hi>Circamcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianes,</hi>
of the Sect of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who not rightly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
the ſayings of the Scripture, touching mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of the fleſh, caſt themſelues downe headlong
from the toppes of high mountaines, and without
looking or ſtaying for any commandement to doe ſo,
reſigned and gaue vp the place they held in this humane
life. It is not lawfull for any priuate perſon, without
expreſſe authority and order of the Magiſtrate, to kill a
guilty or condemned perſon; And hee which killeth
himſelfe is not hee a murtherer? Who hath giuen him
power and authority to doe ſo? We abhorre, and iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the facinourous fact of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who by diſpaire increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his deteſtable impiety. Sathan is the author of ſuch
counſells, as wee ſee in the fourth Chapter of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi>
where Chriſt Ieſus being importuned, by that
malignant and miſchieuous one, to throw himſelfe
headlong from the top of the Temple, anſwereth, That
we muſt not tempt the Lord. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayd, in his
firſt Booke, <hi>De Ciuitate Dei,</hi> Chap. 22. That thoſe
which kill themſelues, make a hazardous proofe of
ſome kind of greatneſſe of courage, but indeed they are
mad men: Further, they are not magnanimous, ſeeing
that being vnable to ſupport and beare aduerſity, they
diſcouer their impotency and puſillanimity, not their
fortitude and valour, in caſting themſelues ſo into the
gulfe and iawes of death. But hee is truely magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
who chooſeth rather to beare the burthen of a
miſerable life, then raſhly to rid himſelfe, and flye from
it, inſtead of ſtanding and abiding in the place allotted
and appointed vnto him. It is ſaid that <hi>Cleombrotus</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
read the Booke which <hi>Plato</hi> writ of the immortality
of mans ſoule, caſt himſelfe downe headlong from a
high wall, to paſſe to the other life, which hee iudged to
be better. But it was an act of wretched folly, for <hi>Plato</hi>
taught no ſuch thing, although he diſcourſed of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the ſoule. Therefore let vs turne our backes
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3512:93"/>
to the Stoickes, ſo brutiſh and beſotted in their pride,
that they thinke it lawfull to a man, which cannot ſuffer
an iniury, to kill himſelfe. A man of courage, and fearing
God, knowing indeed that life is not giuen him, doth
not violently rid himſelfe of it, but renders it into the
hands of God, not fearing the approaches of death, but
ſubmitting himſelfe to his Soueraigne Lord, who hath
imployed him in his ſeruice in the world, to goe out of
it when he ſhall commaund him. It is alledged, that a
ſpeedy death is better then a faſtidious and tedious life,
and once to bee quiet for altogether, then ſo long to
languiſh and droope. But to attempt to leaue this life
before God giue vs leaue, is to fall into another death,
which neuer hath end. What then, ſhall not a Souldier
dare to goe out of the armie, without his Captaines li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
and paſſe port, but vpon hazard of his head, and
ſhall mortall man goe out of this preſent life, without
the auouchy and warrant of the immortall, who hath
placed him in it, protected and bleſſed him. What
crowne can the impatient, the furious, the infidell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
who in diſpite of his Lord, cowardly reſignes his
charge, his place, his honour, with the loſſe of his body,
ſoule, goods, and friends, who forſakes thoſe to whom
hee is bound and beholden, breakes all the bandes of
diuine and humane ſociety? God giueth a happy iſſue
to their temptations who feare him, hee doth in fit time
deliuer and helpe them. It is they which are to hold
out to the end in a full aſſurance of hope, not to quaile
and loſe courage, but to follow thoſe, who by a faithfull
and humble patience haue obtained the promiſed inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.
Let vs then take heed and beware of the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
of the Stoickes, and of the vaine confidence of
<hi>Epicures,</hi> who neuer thinke on death, but thinke they
are in league and friendſhip with him, perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
that it ſhall be eaſie for them to put by his blowes,
and to pacifie him. Moreouer, let vs haue no part in
their effeminacy and diffidence, who tremble at the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3512:93"/>
meere name of death, not thinking that in death it ſelfe
there is not ſo great euill, as in the ſolicitudes, carkings,
ſorrowes, and feares, wherewith a thouſand times a day
they kill themſlues, without any eaſe to their vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
heart. Their apprehenſions are ill ordered, fond,
and vnprofitable, ſeeing (as witneſſeth the Prophet in
the Pſalme 89. 90.) there is no man liuing can boaſt
himſelfe not to ſee death, and to be able to ſaue his life
out of the hand of the graue. Hereupon we will ſay to
young and old, that their duty requires, that they beare
and behaue themſelues ſo toward God, that their death
may not be a mortall, but a liuing death: And that they
ſo gently and wiſely lay downe their load in the world,
that they may not be found vnder a heauy and vnſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
burthen, whoſe weight doth ſuppreſſe
them, and cauſe them to tumble into euerlaſting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
               <p>5. Fifthly, let vs now adde ſome aſſured conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
againſt death; and firſt we will draw from certaine
places of the holy Scripture, the faire termes and names,
which it giueth to death, to ſweeten vnto vs the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of it. By whoſe teſtimony, to dye, is to bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
to his people, as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 25. 8.
It is to goe the way of all the earth. 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 2. It is to
be bound vp in the bundle of life. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 29. It is to
be taken away from euill, to enter into peace and reſt in
our beds. <hi>Eſaiah</hi> 57. 1, 2. It is to be in the ſhadow, and
at reſt as the hireling, which hath ended his dayes
worke. <hi>Iob</hi> 7. 1. 2. It is to ſleepe. <hi>Iohn 11. 11. 1. Theſſ.</hi>
4. 13. To reſt from his labours. <hi>Apocalips</hi> 14. 13. It is
to goe out of the world to goe to God our Father. <hi>Iohn</hi>
13. 1. It is to goe to our Fathers houſe, where there are
many dwelling places. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 1. It is to returne to our
home and countrey, after a long, painefull, and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
voyage. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. It is to be vnſhackled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
out of a galley or priſon, to bee with Chriſt
Ieſus. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 23. It is to goe hence out of a poore beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:3512:94"/>
tabernacle. 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 14. It is to be clothed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
with glory and immortality. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. 2. It is to
finiſh our courſe and our fight, to receiue a crowne.
2. <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4. 7. 8. It is to goe to the Nuptialls of the
Lambe, and his Bride in the Celeſtiall Ieruſalem, in the
City of God, all garniſhed with gold and precious
ſtones, that is, adorned with incomprehenſible glory
and eternall happineſſe. <hi>Apocalips</hi> 21. 1. &amp;c. It is to liue
with Ieſus Chriſt a thouſand yeares, to wit, for euer.
<hi>Apocalips</hi> 20. 4. This life and glorious immortality
is manifeſted vnto vs in the Goſpel by Chriſt Ieſus,
who by his appearing hath aboliſhed death. 2. <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi>
1. 10.</p>
               <p>Wherefore then ſhould a wiſe man feare to goe to
his Fathers, and would haue a way by himſelfe? Is it
well done not to will, and deſire to be gathered with the
true liuing, from ſo many euills, without, within, aboue,
belowe, behinde, before, and round about vs? After ſo
many battailes, ſo many conflicts, skirmiſhes, and
wounds, eſpecially in the ſoule, to refuſe peace, to reſt
out of the ſhort and danger of the weapons, teares,
alarmes, vacarmes, gurboyles, and ſtirres of the world,
of our owne heart, of the corruption of the wicked, and
of the powers of Sathan our capitall aduerſary? O
ſtrange caſe! Wee runne after peace and reſt, and flye
from it when it offers it ſelfe. Trauailes and labours
weigh vs downe and oppreſſe vs, and we are agaſte and
abaſhed to bee ridde of them! There is no bed in the
world ſo ſoft, as that where the bodies doe reſt, when
the ſoules are ſeparated from them; notwithſtanding
not to lie in it, we would be contented to bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to goe wooll ward, in ſackcloth, and haire cloth
in totters and ragges, and to lye on the hard ground, or
vpon thornes; Had we rather dwell with Vipers, then
with our Father in his heauenly Manſion? Thoſe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Manſions, ſo much to be deſired, are in leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
and eſteeme with vs, then the vncleane and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3512:94"/>
naſtie ſtables of Beaſtes. The earth doth more infinitely
pleaſe vs then heauen.</p>
               <p>This galley of our life, where we tugg both day and
night, at the oare of ambition, auarice, cruell luſtes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
pleaſures; Theſe darke dennes of innumerable
ſinnes are the reſting places, that we make much on, and
wherein we briſtle vp our ſelues, and outragiouſly curſe
whatſoeuer ſacred Philoſophie doth propoſe and ſet
forth vnto vs, of the bleſſed eſtate of the triumphant
Church, with her head in heauen. What old men are
we, who grow young in our vices, who had rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
our ſweete Countrie, and trott vp and downe
in the hideous deſertes of the world, full of ſcorpions
and Baſiliſques, of horrid ghoſtes, and hob goblins, and
ſo many kindes of Deuills, then to ſet one ſteppe in the
right way of repentant faith, of charitable hope and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
humilitie! Men of wit, where is our wit, when
our bodies are of more price vnto vs then our ſoules,
and we are willing to forgoe and looſe our armes to
ſaue our ſleeues? Who preferre a garment before eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
glory, a handfull of crownes before moſt durable
treaſures, a fond, idle, wicked damnable pleaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euerlaſting ioyes! Who ſtill deſire to runne on in
the way of perdition, who fight and ſtriue againſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but pietie, righteouſneſſe, holineſſe; to conclude,
who purchaſe a buryall place for vertue, to cauſe vice to
raigne and triumph. When will it be, that the invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the ſolemne feaſt of the Sonne of God with his
Church, will pleaſe and be well-come vnto vs? When
will we prouide our coſtly rich robes to appeare in this
holy aſſembly? Will we ſtill deferre to cleanſe our ſelues
from the filth of ſinne, which makes vs holds downe the
head, to bluſh, to looke pale, and wan, to be halfe dead,
or in a traunce, not to dare once to lift vp the eyes of
our minde (but in hypocriſie, and a very ſtrange ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie)
to him, which calleth vs to him, to the gates of the
Pallace, whereunto we are ſo neere? Wiſe old men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3512:95"/>
and rouze vp your ſelues, and more deepely yet
conſider and meditate vpon the conſolations inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and inſerted in the termes and names, which diuine
wiſedome giueth and aſcribeth to death.</p>
               <p>It is demanded, ſeeing Chriſt Ieſus hath aboliſhed
death, and that by him we are reconciled to God to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
eternall life, how comes it to paſſe that we are ſtill
ſubiect to death? S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> anſwereth, that hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
death came, and was by ſin haled into the world,
but now death takes away our temporall life, to the end
we ſhould ceaſe from ſinne, and that the remembrance
of death doe keepe and conteme vs in our dutie. So by
the vnſpeakeable mercie of God, the puniſhment of our
ſinnes, was changed into an armour, or ſhield againſt
ſinnes. And although that the death of the fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
originally from ſinne, ſo is it that the good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and face of death hath made many excellent Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.
And although death and all the euils, trauailes, and
turmoyles, vexations, and ſorrowes of this preſent life
proceed from the deſert of our ſinnes, and that after
hauing obtained pardon, theſe euills remaine ſtill, it is
to the end we ſhould haue aduerſaries to wraſtle againſt
and to exerciſe vs, to make knowne and ſenſible to vs
how ſtrong the power of the Lord is in our weakenes:
And that ſo the new man may grow vp, and bee fitted
and prepared in this world for the world to come, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the perfect and compleat happineſſe of all Gods
children. Therefore repentant Chriſtians, whoſe ſins
are pardoned, and who accept this pardon by the gift
and hand of a liuely faith, doe wraſtle againſt the image
of death, againſt a bruiſed Serpent, a wourried torne
Lyon, againſt a ſtingleſſe Waſpe, againſt a vanquiſhed
enemie. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> cenſureth in good manner thoſe
wretches, who feare death, and feare not ſinne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they are inſnared and wrapped, nor the vnquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
fire of hell which gapes for them. Thus, ſayth he, as
children are wayward and wrangle, if their mothers
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3512:95"/>
come neere them with maskes on their faces, but when
a lighted Candle is brought neere vnto them, they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
thruſt their handes in it, and are burned: So thoſe
men feare death, who know not what it is to liue. Death
ſnatcheth away a miſerable and ſhort life to make vs to
enter into an eternall and perpetuall bleſſed life. Death
doth ſeperate vs from the heapes of Iewells, the robes,
moueables, coffers crammed with gold and ſiluer, the
ſundrie immoueables which we muſt leaue. But in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
we haue vnſeperable riches with the Angels: death
extrudes and thruſtes vs out of the earth, but to bring
vs into paradize: death kills the bodie, but it ſhall riſe
againe to die no more, but be conformable to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
bodie of Chriſt Ieſus. If any man fight with his
owne ſhadow, he hurtes no bodie: ſo death doth but
beate the ayre, in bickering and jouſting againſt the juſt.
It hath beene Gods will and pleaſure (ſo ſayth <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>)
that this preſent life ſhould be painefull and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
to the end that being buffetted on all ſides with
ſo many and manifold miſeries, we ſhould eagerly aſpire
to the happineſſes to come. But ſeeing we are thus farre
ill aduiſed to wallow and idle it ſo willingly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
life, where ſo many diſaſters and miſeries doe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round
and encompaſſe vs, how would it be with vs,
if there were nothing but ioy, peace, and reſt here? Our
moſt mercifull heauenly Father doth ſo mitigate and
temper the afflictions of this life, that as a Lute-player
doth not winde vp too high his Lute ſtrings, for feare
to breake them, nor ſlacken them too much, that ſo their
ſweete harmonie &amp; tunableneſſe may be more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perceiued: So doth the wiſe maiſter of our life, not
leauing vs in continuall proſperitie, nor too much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.
He is faithfull who will not ſuffer vs to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
beyond and aboue our ſtrength, but will giue a good
iſſue to our temptations and tryalls, to the end we ſhould
be able to beare them.</p>
               <p>We ſee men of warre, deſirous of honour, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3512:96"/>
to ſome rancke and degree, manfully to expoſe
themſelues to a thouſand dangers: The couetous Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
to runne vpon all hazards and riſques for a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of yellow earth: The voluptuous perſon to diſdaine
and ſet light by infinite, reprochfull and woefull dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
to ſatisfie his paſſions and humours: And you
wiſe old men, will you ſlumber and ſleepe in a corner,
will you ſtill ſit with your armes and legges a croſſe, not
rouzing &amp; lifting vp your ſelues to the contemplation,
and diligent ſeeking after ſo many happineſſes, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for them which loue God? Doe you feare death,
you which in the middeſt of the ſhadowe of death, haue
ſtanding at your ell-bow the Prince and Author of life?
If you beare in your hearts that quickning ſpirit, which
raiſed vp Ieſus Chriſt from the dead, whence is it that
you feare death? Haue you blotted out of your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
him, who hath the wordes of eternall life, who
is the way, the truth, the reſurrection, the life, who dyed
for our ſinne, and is riſen againe for our iuſtification?
But ſoyle not this gracious remembrance with the myre
and mudd of ſordid and obſcene pleaſures: Let not the
perſwaſions of the vncleane and filthie fleſh ſtoppe and
hinder the motions of the ſpirit, illuminated by ſacred
Philoſophie. Let the repetitions of his moſt ſweete,
moſt certaine, and moſt holy promiſes bee potent and
powerfull in your hearts, who was willing to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
of our fleſh and bloud, that in the ſame nature foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by Sathan, our Sauiour hath aboliſhed it by his death,
as by a moſt ſufficient ranſome, he which conquered
death, to wit, the Deuill. Giue me leaue to reforme and
rectifie you by recitall of the excellent promiſes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Lord. Verely, I ſay vnto you, that whoſoeuer
heareth my word, and beleeueth in him which ſent
mee, hath eternall life, and ſhall not come to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but is paſſed from death to life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 24. This
is the will of him which ſent me, that whoſoeuer behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the ſonne, and beleeueth in him, hath eternall life,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3512:96"/>
and for this cauſe I will raiſe him vp againe at the laſt
day. Such perſpection and contemplation of faith is not
(as prophane perſons chatter and mutter) a vaine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination;
but is coupled and covnited with his effect,
and with the true apprehenſion and laying hold of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, and his benefites. This great Sauiour hath
ſo often times, and againe and againe recommended it,
and for confirmation of it, hath prepared his holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to which we draw neere, there to receiue the bread
of life, ordayned to the nouriſhment of our ſoules to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life, not for our bellies, to receiue which bread
we hold vp the hands of faith to heauen, and beleeuing
in him doe eate it. That bread I ſay which is giuen to
the children of the houſe, not to reprobates, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
eate the bread of the Lord, but not the bread of
life which is the Lord. He which is not reconciled to
Chriſt Ieſus, eateth not his fleſh, and drinketh not his
bloud, although euery day hee receiue (but to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation)
the Sacrament, or the holy ſignes of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
a thing. But he which confirmes and eſtabliſheth
vs in Chriſt, and who hath annoynted vs, is God, who
alſo hath ſealed and giuen vnto vs the earneſt of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in our hearts. It is this holy ſpirit of promiſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we haue beene ſealed, yea, for the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without which ſpirit the viſible ſignes in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes
are receiued to condemnation, by which ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
faith taught by the word &amp; confirmed by the ſignes,
or ſeales of the righteouſneſſe of the ſame faith, takes
daily new growthes and growinges, and is manifeſted
by holy workes; of which the ſumme and totall is, that
we liue and die to the Lord, who is dead and riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to haue dominion, as well over the liuing as the
dead, to gouerne and guide vs as the ſheepe of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture;
and finally, to draw vs out of the hideous deſerts
of this worldly life, no life in deed, to gather vs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
his heauenly ſheep folde. If God be on our ſide,
who ſhall be againſt vs? Who ſhall bee able to make vs
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3512:97"/>
afraide and diſmay vs? Ieſus Chriſt who is dead, is riſen
againe, it is he who now being ſet at the right hand of
God maketh requeſt for vs.</p>
               <p>Let vs adde ſome worthie ſayinges of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in
his excellent Treatiſe of death. <hi>Simeon</hi> the iuſt, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to hold in his armes the little babe Ieſus, whom
he had ſo much deſired, declareth by his wordes (which
breathed nothing but faith, charitie, conſolation, a
ſtedfaſt hope) that the ſeruants of God are in peace, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
a free reſt, being drawne out of the foaming and
tempeſtuous waues of this world, and landing at the
port of ſafetie, and eternall happineſſe, when after the
aboliſhment of death we come to a glorious immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
For this is our peace, our aſſured reſt, our aſſured
and perpetuall ſafetie. In this world we are continually
grapling, tugging, and wraſtling with Sathan, and all
our exerciſe is, to repulſe and repell his dartes. We haue
on our armes, on our foreheads, ſides, and backes, ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
incontinencie, anger, ambition: of neceſſitie wee
muſt wraſtle without ceaſing againſt the luſtes of the
fleſh, and the baites and allurements of the world. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the end of the ſame Treatiſe, hee ſayth further,
that we muſt not weepe for our brethren, when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
God to call and deliuer them out of this world; for
well I know that they are not loſt, but gone before, and
haue the ſtart of thoſe who tarrie behinde. Wee may
deſire and looke after them, as men do for their friends,
who are going ſome voyage, or who take ſhipping to
ſayle, and goe to land in a good port. But we muſt not
bewayle them, nor here weare black mourning habitts,
ſeeing they haue alreadie receiued white robes in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
It becomes vs not to giue occaſion to Heathens
juſtly to tax and reproue vs, if they ſee by an inordinate
loue our countenance appalled and agaſt thinking them
vtterly loſt, and annihilated, whom we hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to be aliue with God, and if they perceiue it wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
euidently enough by our minde, that wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3512:97"/>
the faith we profeſſe with our mouthes. In this
caſe we ouer throw our faith, and our hope, which we
could not ſay but to proceed of hypocriſie. It is nothing
to ſhew our ſelues hardie in wordes, if we evert and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the truth with our doings and deedes.</p>
               <p>It is tyme to conclude this Chapter. We ſay then that
the anxieties of minde, maladies, perplexities, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of ſo many deathes which doe ſpurne and
kicke againſt vs, doe ſilently and tacitely cry vnto vs,
and exhort vs with ſpeed to lift vp our eyes to Chriſt
Ieſus the fountaine of life, to the communion we haue
with him, alſo to the bleſſinges alreadie receiued of him,
and to thoſe, which the hope which makes vs not afraide,
doth aſſuredly expect. And following the counſell of
S. <hi>Baſile</hi> in his Treatiſe, that thankes muſt alwayes bee
giuen to God; Let vs not put our affiance and truſt in
man, nor let vs ſay with the ignorant vulgar, death hath
taken from me all my ſuccour and helpe, my father, my
husband, my ſonne, the comfort of my old age, the
prop and piller of my houſe: Who hath commaunded
you to moore your ancher of hope in ſuch a little lump
of duſt as man is? What age is priuiledged from the
handes of death? What a one is he who by couenant
made with vs proteſteth that he will be the God of their
fathers, and of their children to a thouſand generations,
who loue &amp; feare him! Shall we forget him, who makes
ſo kinde a proffer of himſelfe to vs, to imagine &amp; forge
to our ſelues ſuccours and helpes of ſtraw and of wind?
Let the ancher of our ſure and ſtedfaſt hope ſincke into
the vaile of heauen, and let it bee ſticking faſte in the
throne of God. It ſhall there be a braſen bullwarke for
vs, a wall of fire. Let Chriſt be our life in death, in him
let death be our gaine. Let vs ſay with <hi>Ieremiah</hi> in the
17. Chapter, Bleſſed be the man, which truſteth in the
Lord, whoſe confidence the Lord is. For he ſhall be as
a tree planted by the water, which ſpreadeth out her
roots by a flowing riuer, which ſhall not feele when the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3512:98"/>
heate ſhall approach, her leafe ſhall be greene, and ſhall
not wither in the yeare of drought, and ſhall not ceaſe
to yeeld her fruit. Let vs further amaſſe and gather ſome
words from the ſame Prophet; O Lord thou art the
hope of thy Church; thoſe that forſake thee ſhall bee
confounded, for they haue forſaken the fountaine of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
waters. Heale thoſe that are thine, O Lord, then
ſhall they be in reſt: ſaue them, and none ſhall bee able
to hurt them. Leaue them not forlorne, and in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
plight, thou which art their hope in the day of
affliction. Let their deſpayring and hopeleſſe enemies
be confounded; and let them reſt in ſafetie vnder the
ſhadow of thy wings.</p>

condition ſhould be more miſerable
then other mens, ſeeing that true
Chriſtians are continually expoſed to diuers afflictions,
and from time to time doe ſuffer great tortures &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.
But what would it auaile to liue in the world, and

and helpe, nor a more ſweete comfort and ſupport a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the miſeries and infirmities of this preſent life,
then the aſſured hope of the reſurrection to a better life.
When we ſhall beare about vs no longer the image of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3512:98"/>
the firſt earthly man, but of the ſecond, who is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>Adam;</hi> and that this corruptible and mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
ſhall put on incorruption and immortalitie. The
ſure confidence of Chriſtians, is the reſurrection from
the dead, wherein we ſhall haue a glorious bodie, which
ſhall be ſo revnited to the bleſſed ſoule, and the ſoule
againe to the bodie, that we may be for euer with our
head, fully repleniſhed with euerlaſting ioy in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God. The Heathens, enemies of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
haue eſpecially impugned this Article of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of the bodie. And which is more, many of
their Philoſophers haue ſpoken doubtfully of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie
of the ſoule. At this tyme, to the end to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
our faith, our hope, and aſſured conſolation, we
will conſider the groundes of theſe two Articles, aſwell
by the nature of things, and by certaine conceptions,
as by the ſound reſolutions rehearſed in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Certainly, as <hi>Gregory</hi> the great ſaid in his Moralls,
That thoſe who haue not learned from the Scripture,
the doctrine of the Reſurrection, ought to learne it of
nature. For what doe men daily obſerue in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
medley and blending of the Elements, whereof
all viſible things are compoſed, but proofes of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the dead? Wee ſee by the viciſſitude and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution
of time, the Plants and Trees to loſe their
greene leaues, which wither and fall off when Winter
comes, after in the Spring to ſprout forth againe, and
the earth to become greene &amp; gay as before. If the ſmal
kernells of ſo many ſeuerall ſeedes, ſomewhat before,
or at the Spring doe grow, ſhoot vp, and become ſo
great, that they are Plants and young Trees in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
or in the Autumne following; Shall wee ſay that
the ſame God, who hath giuen this vertue to ſeedes, is
not able to doe as much in the moſt noble of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and made expreſly for his glory? Chriſt Ieſus
propoundeth this argument, when hee ſayth in the 12.
Chapter of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Verily, verily, I ſay vnto you, if
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3512:99"/>
the wheat corne falling into the earth doe not dye, it
abideth alone, but if it dye, it bringeth forth much fruit,
And S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the fifteenth Chapter of the firſt to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> Verſ. 35. &amp;c. But ſome man will ſay, How
are the dead raiſed vp, and with what bodies, come they
forth? O foole, that which thou ſoweſt is not quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
except it dye, and as for that which thou ſoweſt,
thou ſoweſt not that which ſhall come vp againe, but
bare corne as it falleth, of wheat, or of other graine.
But God giueth it a body as hee will, and to euery ſeede
his owne body.</p>
               <p>The Patriarch <hi>Iob,</hi> in his fourteenth Chapter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
the frailty of our life in earth, prayeth God in
theſe tearmes; Turne from the man that is afflicted,
let him be at reſt till hee come to the end of his life, as a
hireling. Then he addeth: For if a Tree be cut downe,
there is hope, and it will yet ſprout, and his branches
ſhall not fayle: Although the root thereof waxe old in
the earth, and the ſtocke thereof be dead in the ground,
yet feeling water it will bud and bring forth bowes, as
a Tree newly planted: But man dyeth, and all his
ſtrength is gone, yea man breatheth out his laſt gaſpe,
then where is hee? Theſe are the complaints of <hi>Iob,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely
afflicted, beholding in his condition, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of ſuch like himſelfe, not ſpeaking preciſely, nor
determinately, much leſſe after the manner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of <hi>Epicures.</hi> On the contrary, both his wordes
of the tree cut downe, and growing greene againe, and
that which hee addeth preſently after, makes it plaine
what ſenſe and feeling hee had in his ſoule, of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
concerning the reſurrection. The waters (ſaith he)
flow from the Sea, and the Riuer decayes and is dryed;
ſo mans lies in the earth, and riſeth not to wake againe,
till the heauens be no more, they ſhall not to wake, and
they ſhall not be awakened from their ſleepe. It is well
ſaid, for our bodies being cut off, and layd vpon the
earth, and in the earth, in the day of death ſhall take
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3512:99"/>
root againe, haue bud and fruit, that is, ſhall liue againe.
They ſhall indeed reſt in the earth, vntill the end of the
world: And as S. <hi>Peter</hi> declareth in the third Chapter of
his ſecond Epiſtle, Verſe 10. The day of the Lord ſhall
come as a theefe in the night: In that day the heauens
ſhall paſſe away, with a whizzing tempeſtuous noyſe,
(It is that which <hi>Iob</hi> denoteth by theſe words, There
ſhall be no more heauens) and the Elements ſhall melt
with heate, and the earth and all the workes therein ſhall
be quite burnt vp. But moreouer, the ſame Patriarch
maketh a plaine confeſſion of his faith, vpon this Article
in the 19. Chap. Verſ. 25. ſaying; As for me, I know that
my Redeemer liueth, and that he ſhall ſtand the laſt day
on the earth, and although after my skinne, wormes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
this body, I ſhall ſee God in my fleſh, whom I my
ſelfe ſhall ſee, and mine eyes ſhall behold him, and none
forme. So then it may bee demonſtrated from the firſt
teſtimony of the tree cut downe, after growing greene
againe, that the reſurrection of the fleſh is not aboue,
nor beyond, beſides, nor againſt nature. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
wee acknowledge, that the mighty power of
God ſhall then bee ſeene, as it was when hee rayſed vp
Chriſt Ieſus ſhut vp in the graue, as the Apoſtle witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
<hi>Rom. 1. 4. Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19. 20. And in the third Chapter of
the <hi>Philippians,</hi> at the end; From heauen (ſayth hee) wee
looke for the Sauiour, and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who
ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned and
made conformable to his glorious body, according to
the working and efficacy, whereby hee is euen able to
ſubdue all things to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Among the ancient Theologians S. <hi>Baſil</hi> doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and ſet out an image of the reſurrection in thoſe
Inſects, which wee call Silke wormes. Wherefore doe
you wonder (ſayth he, in his expoſition of the ſix daies)
at the change which ſhall bee of our bodies at the day of
the reſurrection? Seeing you ſee ſo many mutations
and changes in the very inſectes, eſpecially in the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3512:100"/>
                  <hi>Indian</hi> worme. It is firſt a Caterpiller, which turnes
to a Silke-worme. Moreouer, it keepes not this forme,
but is changed into a Butter-flye. You, thoſe women,
who artificially winde vp your quilles and bobbins of
ſilke, and ſo cunningly and wittily twiſted on your fine
skaines and clues, to make the moſt coſtly and curious
garments that can be worne; Remember you the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
of this admirable worme, to gather from it a cleere
and certaine teſtimonie of the reſurrection, and beleeue
that one day our bodies ſhall be otherwiſe, then they be
in this preſent life, and in the graue. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the
booke which he penned of the reſurrection of the fleſh,
confirmeth this Article of our faith, by reaſons worthy
memory. What difference is there at the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to giue vs our life, and after to reſtore it againe?
We cannot diſpiſe the fleſh of man, except wee would
alſo diſpiſe the Lord and Creator of the ſame fleſh. The
earth, from whence the body of our fleſh was taken, is
vile; but that which is abiect and contemptible in his
originall, may bee excellent in regard of his very ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence
and matter. Gold is but yellow earth, and yet is
much more precious then any other earth. Doe we call
the fleſh vile, wherein God hath infuſed the breath of
his Spirit? which the Sonne of God hath priſed, hath
willed to be baptiſed, and commanded to receiue the
holy ſignes of the Sacrament with thankeſgiuing? True
it is, that the workes of the fleſh, that is, of mans nature
corrupted by ſinne, are condemned, but not the fleſh it
ſelfe, which the Sonne of God hath reſumed, and taken
into the vnity of his perſon, being God-man euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly.
Moreouer, the accompliſhment of the laſt
iudgement ſhould bee imperfect, if the whole man
ſhould not appeare there, to the end that hee who hath
ſuffered in his body, for the confeſſion of the truth, may
receiue remiſſion and repoſe, and that hee whoſoeuer,
hath made the members of his body ſlaues to execute
wickedneſſes, may be puniſhed. Alſo, it is meete that
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3512:100"/>
we ſhould take vpon vs to ſpanne with our fingers, and
meaſure with our arme the miracles of God, who alone
(as all people who are not altogether brutiſh doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch)
doth wonderfull workes, of purpoſe that there
might bee many choyce and rare things in the world,
and not to be paralleld, whereof the reaſon is hid from
vs, though we ſee the things themſelues. But there is a
great difference betweene the deſtruction or annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the change of nature. As we beleeue the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of this our fleſh, ſo is it certaine that the nature
of the ſame fleſh, ſhall ſubſiſt and remaine in the life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall:
But the condition ſhall be changed, in as much
as this fleſh, vile and miſerable, ſhall be made glorious
and happy. Theſe are ſome proofes brought by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lactantius Firmianus</hi> in his Booke of the Heauenly
Reward, Chap. 23. obſerueth, That the Pagan Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
who deſired to diſcourſe of the laſt reſurrection,
haue confounded and ſoyled this Article of our faith,
as al the Poets haue done. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> maintained, that
the ſoule did tranſmigrate and paſſe out of one mans
body into anothers, and that he himſelfe in the <hi>Troian</hi>
warre was <hi>Euphorbus. Chryſippus</hi> the Stoicke hath made
a better anſwere, who in his Booke, <hi>De Prouidentia,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing
of the reſtauration of the world, addeth; This
being ſo, wee ſee that it is not impoſſible that after our
death, at the end of the reuolutions of ſome ages, wee
may bee reſtored againe into the ſtate and condition
wherein we are now. But (as <hi>Lactantius</hi> addeth) the faith
of Chriſtians is much otherwiſe, and their hope much
more certaine. For they vndoubtedly beleeue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of the fleſh, confirmed by moſt ſacred and
inuincible proofes of the holy Scripture, by the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of God, and by the motions of the Spirit, which ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
vp Chriſt Ieſus from the dead; as the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
it in the eight Chapter to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> ſaying, If
the Spirit of him that rayſed vp Ieſus from the dead,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3512:101"/>
dwell in you, hee that rayſed vp Chriſt from the dead,
ſhall quicken alſo your mortall bodies, becauſe of the
Spirit dwelling in you. True it is, that the wicked ſhall
riſe againe in their bodies, but this ſhall not bee for any
communion they haue with the body of Chriſt Ieſus,
nor with his Spirit, but ſimply by the abſolute power
of God, who ſhall giue them againe their being, life, and
motion to ſuffer the ſecond death, being for euer dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in their bodies and ſoules. So then, ſuch a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
cannot be counted grace, nor called regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
nor a reſurrection to life, but a repairing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
whereof <hi>S. Iohn</hi> writes theſe wordes in the
twentith Chapter of the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> Verſe eleuenth, &amp;c. I
ſaw a great white throne, and one that ſate on it, from
whoſe face fled away the earth and the heauen, and their
place was no more found. I ſaw the dead great and ſmall
ſtanding before God, and the Bookes were opened, and
another Booke was opened, which is the Booke of
Life, and the dead were iudged by the things which
were written in the bookes, according to their workes,
and the Sea gaue vp her dead which were in her, and
death and hell deliuered vp the dead which were ion
them, and they were iudged euery man according to
their workes. And the wicked were caſt into the lake
of fire: this is the ſecond death. And whoſoeuer was
not found written in the Booke of Life, was caſt into
the lake of fire.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed then bee God the Father of our Lord Ieſus
Chriſt, who by his great mercy hath regenerated vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a liuely hope by the reſurrection of Chriſt Ieſus from
the dead, to obtain an incorruptible inheritance, which
cannot bee defiled, nor fade away, reſerued in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens

thorough faith, to haue the ſaluation prepared to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed
at the laſt day: wherein we reioyce, being now
made heauy by diuers temptations, as it is meete, to the
end that the triall of our faith, much more precious then
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3512:101"/>
gold, (which periſheth and yet is tried in the fire) may
turne to our prayſe, honour, and glory, when Ieſus
Chriſt ſhall be reuealed, who ſpeaketh thus vnto vs in
the perſon of his Diſciples, in the beginning of the 14.
Chapter of <hi>S. Iohn.</hi> Let not your hearts bee troubled;
You beleeue in God, beleeue alſo in me: There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

the 19. chap. of his Manuel) ſhal riſe againe without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh,
without deformity, without corruption, heauines,
or impediment; This ſhall as eaſily be done, as their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
ſhall be conſummated: for which cauſe wee call
them ſpirituall, although their bodies ought ſtill to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
not to be changed into Ghoſts and Spirits. As
for the corruption which now preſſeth downe the
ſoule, and the vices by whoſe meanes the fleſh luſteth
againſt the ſpirit, ſuch fleſh ſhall ceaſe to be, becauſe it
could not be able to poſſeſſe the Kingdome of God. In
regard of the ſubſtance of the ſame fleſh, it ſhall not be
aboliſhed, but ſtill remaine, but euerlaſtingly glorified.
For this cauſe <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaid, That the body being ſowen
a fleſhly body ſhall riſe againe a ſpirituall body; becauſe
there ſhall be ſo ſtrong an vnion betweene the ſoule and
the body, that the ſoule making the body to liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

combate and ſtriuing within vs betweene the ſpirit and

aſſaults, nor dangers whatſoeuer, without, nor
within, but ſhall be repleat, compaſſed about, ſaciated,
crowned with permanent glory. Behold, as touching
this point of the reſurrection of the fleſh. The beleefe
of this Article encourageth all Chriſtians, but particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wiſe old men, patiently to beare their infirmities and
maladies; remembring the counſell of the Apoſtle S.
<hi>Peter,</hi> in the third Chapter of his ſecond Epiſtle; Seeing
that ſo it is (ſayth he) that the heauens and the earth muſt
be diſſolued, what manner of perſons ought wee to bee
in holy couerſation, and holy workes? looking for and
haſting vnto the comming of the day of the Lord, by
whom the heauen being ſet on fire ſhall bee diſſolued,
and the Elements ſhal melt with heate. But according to
his promiſe wee looke for new heauens, and a new
earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſſe. Wherefore
beloued, ſeeing ye looke for ſuch things, be diligent that
ye may bee found of him in peace, without ſpot, and
blameleſſe. Let vs ſtrengthen this Article of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
by the notable ſayings of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
Chap. 5. of the 2. Epiſtle. We muſt all appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the iudgement ſeat of Chriſt, that euery man may
receiue according to what he hath done in his body, be
it good or euill. Knowing then the terror of the Lord,
we perſwade men to the faith, and wee are made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
to God. And that which he ſayth at the end of the
fourth Chapter of the firſt to the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> This we
ſay vnto yee by the word of the Lord, that wee which
ſhall liue and remaine to the comming of the Lord, ſhall
not preuent them which ſleepe. For the Lord himſelfe
with a ſhout, with the voyce of the Archangell, and
with the Trumpet of God ſhall deſcend from heauen,
and thoſe which are dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
wee which ſhall bee aliue and remaine, ſhall bee
caught vp with them alſo in the cloudes to meete the
Lord in the ayre, and ſo ſhall we euer be with the Lord.
O how great occaſion haue young and old, who
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3512:102"/>
read theſe things, to thinke vpon and conſider their
conſciences!</p>
               <p>Let vs adde ſome lineaments of the immortalitie of
mans ſoule; not that wee thinke that any good man
doth call in doubt this truth: but becauſe we cannot too
much fortifie young nor old againſt the bloudie ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings,
&amp; execrable blaſphemies of Epicures &amp; Atheiſtes,
with whom the earth is couered in theſe latter tymes.
Many auncient Philoſophers, as <hi>Pythagoras, Pherecydes,</hi>
the <hi>Platoniſtes,</hi> and the Stoickes, haue ſet forth many ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges
of the immortalitie of the ſoule, as much as they
could learne out of the Schoole of Nature; And yet (as
<hi>Lactantius</hi> declares it, in his 7. booke of Diuine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
ſeeing they were ignorant, wherein the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
good of man doth conſiſt, vnlearned in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
of the Prophets and Apoſtles, they apprehended
not any thing of the truth of this Article, but by vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
opinion, and coniecture, rather then by aſſured
knowledge. Yea, which is worſe, ſome of them, firſt <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caearchus,</hi>
then <hi>Democritus,</hi> and after them <hi>Epicurus,</hi> haue
diſputed againſt the immortalitie of ſoules. <hi>Cicero</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
who otherwiſe doth eloquently harang and pleade
this cauſe in the firſt booke of his <hi>Tuſculane</hi> queſtions, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
examined diuers opinions, is at a demurr &amp; doubt
euen to ſay, that it belongs to ſome god, to ſcan and to
ſee which of all theſe diuers opinions are maintained
ſayth he, becauſe theſe diuers opinions are maintained
by learned men, we cannot well coniecture, which of
them all is to be receiued. But as <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſayth, wee
to whom God manifeſteth his truth, need not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture.</p>
               <p>But the ſource and ſpring of error vpon this poynt
is, that thoſe who haue queſtioned the certaintie of the
immortalitie of the ſoule, haue ſtood too much vpon
their owne conceiptes and vnderſtanding, judging falſe
and incomprehenſible whatſoeuer was out of the reach
of their apprehenſion. Their reaſons are well ſet forth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3512:103"/>
and fitly confuted in the ſecond and third Chapter of
the Booke of <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> as it followeth. The wicked
haue falſely imagined with themſelues, our life is ſhort,
and full of vexation, and in the death of man there is no
recouery, and it was neuer knowne that any returned
from the graue. For we are borne at aduenture, and ſhall
be as if we had neuer beene, becauſe the breath of our
noſtrilles is as ſmoake, and our wordes as a ſparke riſing
vp out of our heart, which being extinguiſhed, our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is turned into aſhes, and our ſpirit vaniſheth as ſoft
ayre. Come then and let vs frolicke it with the pleaſures
that are preſent, chearefully vſing the creatures, and our
youth; let vs fill our ſelues with the beſt wine, and with
parfumes, &amp;c. It is added alſo after; The wicked haue
thus erred, and gone aſtray, becauſe their wickedneſſe
hath blinded them, and they haue not vnderſtood the
myſteries of God, nor hoped for the reward of holines,
and haue not diſcerned what is the reward of the ſoules
that are faultleſſe. For God created man to be incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,
hauing made him to be an Image of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and likeneſſe, but thorough the enuie of the Deuill,
death is come into the world, and thoſe which hold on
his ſide proue it. But the ſoules of the righteous are in
the hand of God, and no torment ſhall touch them. In
the ſight of the vnwiſe they ſeemed to die, &amp; their end
was grieuous. At their departure from vs, they ſeemed
vtterly deſtroyed, but they are in peace. They ſuffered
paines before men: their hope was full of immortalitie:
hauing beene lightly, or in few things puniſhed, they
ſhall be plentifully rewarded, becauſe God hath proued
them as gold, and hath found them worthie of him.
They ſhall judge the Nations, and ſhall haue dominion
ouer the people, and their Lord ſhall raigne for euer.
Thoſe which truſt in him ſhall vnderſtand the truth,
and the faithfull ſhall remaine with him in loue; For
grace and mercy is to his Saints, and he hath care of his
elect. But the vngodly ſhall be puniſhed for their very
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3512:103"/>
imaginations, who haue made no reckoning of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and haue rebelled againſt the Lord. For wicked
is he, who deſpiſeth Wiſedome and Diſcipline; their
hope is vaine, their labours helpe them not, and their
workes are vnprofitable.</p>
               <p>From theſe words we gather, that the abhominable
opinion of the mortalitie of the ſoule openeth the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe
to error, and letteth goe the raynes to all impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and diſſolution. Whereunto doth ſort and agree the
ſcoffing ſpeeches of Epicures and prophane ones, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
and ſhift off the judgments of God denounced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, of which <hi>Eſaiah</hi> in the 22. Chapter, and Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> in the 15. Chapter of the 1. to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> make
mention: Let vs eate and drinke for to morrow we ſhall
die: Let vs be frolicke and merry, we haue but one day
more to liue; This is the reckoning of theſe clamourers
and brawlers, who deafe and trouble our eares with their
diſcourſes and reaſons.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, this Text of the Booke of <hi>Wiſedome</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth
the prophaneneſſe of theſe ſenſuall, and carnall
men, to proceede from this, that they judge of the ſoule
of man according to their groſſe imaginations to wit,
that it is no other but a reſpiration, a breath, and vapour
of ſmoake: not conſidering there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the effect and the cauſe, that is, betweene reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
which proceedes from the lunges, and is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the noſtrills, or to the mouth, and the ſoule it ſelfe,
which is that eſſentiall ſpirit, which formeth man, yea,
doth many thinges without the adiument and helpe of
the bodie, witneſſe her ſpeculations, deepe imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
profound meditations, ſhee being neuer idle and
without motion, when the bodie is faſte a ſleepe and
ſtirres not. Although then that reſpiration ceaſeth, the
naturall faculties of the heart and lunges being ſuffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and leauing their office, the ſoule created to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God is not ſtifled, and aboliſhed; ſo as there is
great difference betweene it and the ſoules of Beaſtes,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3512:104"/>
which being formed with the bodies of the ſame matter
that the bodies are, doe periſh alſo as the bodies, and
with them: whereof it is, that the Beaſtes doe ſuour the
earth, and deſire nothing but that which is earthie, and
of the earth: Man on the contrary (as the wiſeſt of the
Heathens, eſpecially <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> in diuers paſſages
of their writings doe obſerue) hath a diuine and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſoule, which being enfranchiſed and deliuered out of
the priſon of the bodie returneth to the place of his
originall; And the more generous the mind of man is,
the more he luſteth after and deſireth heauenly thinges,
meditating and looking for a better ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then he enioyeth in this preſent life. From thence
it commeth to paſſe, that he deſpiſeth loſſes and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
calamities, wounds, and death it ſelfe, holding it a
great honour to yeeld vp his ſoule in ſome valiant and
vertuous exployt, and enterpriſe for the ſeruice and
ſafetie of his Countrie, to the end to goe to the other
life, where good men haue their reward. <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſayth,
that the vertuous effectes and ſuffringes of the minde,
are no leſſe immortall then the ſoule it ſelfe, which to vs
is common with God, but the body aſſimilateth and a
greeth with the beaſtes.</p>
               <p>Another reaſon hath ſtrongly perſwaded the auncient
Philoſophers to beleeue the immortality of mans ſoule:
That God ſhould ſeeme otherwiſe vniuſt, if he ſhould
ſuffer the vau-neantes, treacherous, diſſolute to proſper
in the world, after to eſcape his vengeance: and good
men, who are induſtrious, and imploy themſelues to
preſerue humane ſocietie, ſhould vtterly periſh in death,
without hope of reſt at the end of their trauailes, and of
ioy after ſo many diſquiets and griefes of minde, and
of a crowne at the end of ſo many thouſand fought bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes
and combatts.</p>
               <p>Vndoubtedly, prophane perſons, who are bold to
thinke and affirme the ſoule of man to bee mortall, doe
aboliſh as much as in them lyes, all pietie and religion,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3512:104"/>
they ouerthrow all vertuous and laudable actions and
enterpriſes, and as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> very well ſayth in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the worke of the ſix dayes, they are madd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, what is more avers, prepoſterous, and
ill beſeeming, then to haue a ſtraight body, and a croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
ſoule, alwayes groveling and ſtooping to the earth,
never lifting or rouzing vp it ſelfe toward heauen her
true dwelling place? But as God our creator hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inſtructed vs in his word touching the originall, end
and ſoueraigne good of man: It is alſo from the ſame
word, that wee muſt gather the infallible doctrines
which we doe handle. Mans ſoule was not compoſed
of the elements, nor fabricated, or formed of the duſt of
the earth, but the Lord God inſpired it, and endowed
it with diuers gifts. Little children doe obtaine even a
ſoule of God their creator, to wit, a reaſonable ſoule,
not of the ſeed of their fathers and mothers, but by the
ſingular fauour and benefit of him, whom the Apoſtle
(<hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.) calleth the Father of ſpirits, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cauſe: For although that he be the father of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
yet notwithſtanding he created not our ſoules by
corporall helpes; but hath placed them in our bodies as
excellent lampes and lights, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeakes of them.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 7. We call them immortall for two reaſons:
firſt, by reaſon of their eſſence, which is ſpirituall and
originarie, or primarie from God the giuer of it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
in regard of the grace (peculier to the children
of God) for ſo much as we haue communion with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, the eternall Word of the Father, the Prince
and author of life. This immortall and eternall life is
the true happie life, and ſo much to be deſired, ſo much
recommended in the Scripture whereof Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
ſayth, The juſt ſhall liue by faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. Alſo, who
beleeueth in me hath eternall life. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 47. And the
Apoſtle ſayth, Ieſus Chriſt hath aboliſhed death, and
brought life and immortalie vnto light thorough the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:3512:105"/>
Goſpell, 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 1. 10. For although the ſoules of the
wicked in regard of their eſſence, ſenſe, and motion,
be immortall, neuertheleſſe they ſuffer death in as much
as they are depriued of the iuſtice, light, beatitude, and
glorious life of God, vpon which cauſe the wicked who
triumph, and braue it for a while in the world are called
dead, and after this preſent life it is ſayd, that they goe
into condemnation, and into eternall death becauſe the
ſtate wherein they are then to be and remaine in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
torments, deſerueth rather the name of death,
then life.</p>
               <p>Prophane people talke they know not what, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting
vnto vs, that neuer any came from the other
world, as they babble and prattle, to tell newes of them.
O the greateſt fooles and idiots among people! O ſilly
ſotts! will they be ſtill madde? miſerable, and more
brutiſh them beaſts, who beleeue nothing but what they
ſee with their eyes and touch with their hands! Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their babble they ought to giue ouer to beleeue,
that they doe participate of reaſon, ſeeing they doe not
ſee their ſoule: Let them giue ouer to beleeue that our
friends dwelling remote and farre from vs, doe liue and
are at their eaſe and content, deſiring to ſee vs againe,
and that becauſe wee ſee them no more. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
it is not ſimply true, that neuer any returned from
the other life; on the contrary, the Hiſtories of the Old
and New Teſtament doe furniſh vs with examples, of
men and women, of young ſtriplings and damſells rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
againe from death.</p>
               <p>The Prince of our faith, the head of all Chriſtians,
our Lord Ieſus deſcending from heauen to aſſume our
humaine nature in earth, hath tould vs ample and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
newes, of the ſtate of heauen and of life eternall.
His aſcenſion to heauen in bodie and ſoule is an aſſured
pledge, that we alſo ſhall aſcend into heauen in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
and ſoules. <hi>S. Paul</hi> caught vp into the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
where he was informed of the high and deepe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3512:105"/>
and ſecrets of God, from thence came to tell vs
afterward many particularities of the Church. Chriſt
Ieſus is in heauen, and we ſhall liue there. For although
that death diſſolue the bodie into duſt, from whence
it was taken; death cannot let the ſoule to returne to
him, that gaue it. And when we die, young and old,
let vs after the example of Chriſt Ieſus, and of <hi>Dauid</hi>
recommend our ſoules to God, rendring them into
his hands, as into the handes of a moſt faithfull keeper
and gardian of them; And let vs ſay with <hi>S. Stephen,</hi>
Lord Ieſus receiue my ſoule: being well aſſured that at
the ſame houre, when it ſhall be fit for vs to goe out of
this preſent life, we haue part in that gracious promiſe
of the ſonne of God, made to the ſinner conuerted,
Verely I ſay vnto thee, that this day thou ſhalt be with
me in Paradize. This is the ſweete voyce, which ſtill
ought to be ſounding in the heart of the wiſe <hi>Vieillard,</hi>
to the end that being at the poynt to leaue this world,
as his age plainely ſhewes him, his conſcience doe not
ſmite and checke him, to be a prophane perſon and a
contemner of God, to be obdurate and hardened in his
ſinnes, and that Sathan bawle not in his eares, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thou haſt delighted in nothing but to ſatisfie thy
luſtes, to follow thy affections and deſires, that thou art
an hypocrite, a lyer, murderer, an vncleane perſon; in
effect that thou haſt loued nothing but the world, that
thou haſt not carried the name of a Chriſtian, but to liue
in all carnall licentiouſneſſe, renouncing the guide-ſhip
of the ſpirit of truth, and holineſſe, thou ſhalt ſpeedily
be with me in hell. Wiſe old men lift vp your thoughts
to the meditation of this doctrine of the Reſurrection
of our bodies, and of the immortalitie of mens ſoules,
ioyning to it the laſt Article of our Faith, to ſay in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

Whence doe proceed ſo many miſeries? God hath
taken away from vs many wiſe old men, many true
Fathers, and men alwayes affected and forward to
procure whatſoeuer was for his glory, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.
Let poſteritie iudge more ſoundly then
wee of what wee doe want. Wee doe not launce this
impoſtume. It is but too much ſayd, if we ſay that
almoſt all, young and old, are the ſlaues of pride, of
diſſolutneſſe, of auarice, of vanitie, in fine borne to the
ſeruitude &amp; ſlauery of vices, and to the hatred of vertues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:3512:107"/>
What doth this ſeruitude beget and bring foorth?
Another ſo lamentable as nothing more. Young men
open your eyes, to the end that your fathers, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
families, may take true comfort in your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
proceedinges, that your countrey may receiue
honourable ſeruice from you: reſemble (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
ſayth in the Pſalme 127.) Arrowes ſhot out of
a ſtrong bowe: Speake in the aſſemblies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
counſells, for pietie, iuſtice, temperance, and
ſtoutly procure the ſuppreſſion of vice, and the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of vertue.</p>
               <p>Let yong men be ſuch as the Apoſtle commandeth,
<hi>Titus</hi> 2. 6. to wit, ſober minded, to the end (that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their vſuall wiſhes and deſires) they may be
ſtrong of body and minde, well reſpected, well wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
eſteemed, and commended, with all the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and immunities, whereof the diſſolute and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
haue no part. And what madneſſe is it, not to
be willing to be imployed alwayes in doing that which
they ought willingly and cheerefully to doe? Let yong
men be ſuch able men, that they may ouercome the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
one, as the moſt wiſe and welbeloued Diſciple
of the Lord requires them to be, in the ſecond Chapter
of his firſt Epiſtle. Aboue all, I pray them that (to
crowne their age with true prayſe) they be ſober, that
they reſpect ancient men, bearing with the lumpiſhneſſe
and ſowerneſſe of thoſe, who haue done them many
good turnes and ſeruices, and who are ſtill able to helpe
and further them much. For hardly can yong age decay
and wrong it ſelfe more, then in appearing, vngratefull,
ſullen, churliſh, and inſolent to aged perſons.</p>
               <p>I come now toyou venerable and reuerend old
men, beſeeching you in the name of the Lord our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Father, to thinke that your vndoubted prayſe,
peace, felicity, aſſured health conſiſteth in this; That
you bee (according to the Apoſtles doctrine) ſober,
graue, meeke, ſound in the fayth, abounding in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:3512:107"/>
patience, and wiſedome. The Emperour <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
in a certaine Edict addreſſed to Chriſtians, ſayth,
That the firſt degree of ſaluation, conſiſteth in an open
confeſſion of the true fayth. The knowledge of true and
comfortable Antiquitie conſiſteth, according to Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle, In this, if
the Fathers know him, who is from the beginning. Let
wiſe old men profit in ſuch knowledge, and let them
not be weary to goe on, and be forward ſchollers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
euen vntill with vnſpeakeable ioy, they behold the
glorious face of the <hi>Ancient</hi> of dayes, and bee entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in his heauenly Pallace. Honour is the nutriment
of old men, ſo alſo is hope, yea that hope which maketh
not aſhamed, the aſſured hope of a better ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and that taſte which wee haue, euen of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation
of God in this preſent life, is the ſound food
and ſolid ſubſtance of wiſe old men. But let vs grow
old in ſuch ſort, that wee may make a good end: that it
be not reproached vnto vs in Gods preſence, that the
laſt yeares of our life, haue beene the worſt of all; But
let vs ſtriue to partake of that ſingular benediction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the end of the Song of the wiſe <hi>Debora,</hi> in
the fifth Chapter of the Hiſtorie of the Iudges; That
thoſe who loue God, ſhall bee as the Sunne going
foorth in his ſtrength. It is not to decline, but to riſe
euen to midday. Our midday is to continue ſuch, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to declyne.</p>
               <p>Not onely old age, but the world alſo is in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline.
Let vs then lift vp our eyes to the Eaſt aboue, let
vs behold the Sonne of righteouſneſſe, let vs turne
our faces that way, leaſt we periſh with the world.</p>
               <p>When we ſhall be departed hence (ſayth Saint <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>
againſt <hi>Demetrius</hi>) there will be no more time to
repent, ſatiſfaction ſhall haue no more effect: In this
world wee loſe or ſaue life. Let no man then bee
hindred by his ſinnes, or by the yeares of his life, to
come to the ſaluation which is offered vnto him. There
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3512:108"/>
is no repentance too late to him that remaines yet in
the world. The gate to obtaine pardon of God is open:
thoſe which ſeeke and follow the truth cloſe, ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
difficulty approach to it. Although you bee ready
to topple into your graue, and haue not much longer
to liue, if you pray the onely true God to pardon your
ſinnes, confeſſing them vnto him, and calling vpon
him in faith vnfainedly, who hath manifeſted himſelfe
vnto you, your requeſt ſhall bee granted, his mercie
ſhall giue you grace to ſaluation, and you ſhall paſſe
from death to eternall life. Chriſt affoordeth vs part of
ſuch grace, hee giueth vs that excellent preſent of his
mercy, hauing ſlaine and put death to death for vs by
the Trophie of his Croſſe, redeeming whoſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth
in him by the price of his blood, reconciling
man to God, quickening him that is dead, by a heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
regeneration. If it bee poſſible let vs follow after
this Sauiour, let vs bee taken and recognized for his
Souldiers, let vs fight vnder his banner. It is hee
which openeth vnto vs the paſſage to life, which doth
bring and ſet vs vp againe in the poſſeſſion of Paradiſe,
which doth guide vs to the Kingdome of heauen: wee
ſhall liue altogether with him, who hath made vs the
children of God, and being reſtored by his precious
blood, we ſhall enioy ioy for euer in his preſence. We
ſhall be glorified with our head, bleſſed in God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
haue our fill of gladneſſe and euerlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in his preſence, whom wee ſhall thanke without
ceaſing. And truely whoſoeuer acknowledging his
miſeries paſt, hath beene made aſſured of immortall
life, it cannot bee but hee will bee alwayes ioyfull, and
render continuall thankes to God. Theſe are the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of S. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> the meditation of which we doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to the wiſe <hi>Vieillard,</hi> and for to excite and ſtir
him vp yet the more thereunto, wee doe preſent vnto
him theſe two Prayers following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:3512:108"/>
O Lord my God, who haſt giuen to man life, vpon
condition to bee a while on the earth, and then
to goe thence by death, to the end to admoniſh mee
that there is a better life, heauenly and eternall; Grant
mee thy grace, I beſeech thee, that as alwayes I ought,
to thinke by all meanes to liue holily, ſo now I may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
to depart happily out of this world: Let the
hope to behold ſpeedily and out of hand thy glory, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue
from mee the feare of death, that I may waite in
ioy for that day, wherein that approaching and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
libertie ſhall vnloſe mee from the chaynes of my
ſinnes, which doe ſo mightily ouerload mee. Let
this hope vphold mee ſo, that I may make no recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of any tranſitory thing, and let humane affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
bee ſo mortified in my frayle members, that I
may not deſire to beginne againe, or to continue my
courſe, but to bee ſoone at an end. Grant that I may
not bee carefull for this wretched body, and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
building, but ſo much onely as may bee fit for
this ſhort life, which remaines for mee to vſe. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
fortifie my minde againſt the many impoſtures,
and guiles of Sathan, which doe compaſſe mee about
on euery ſide. I am aſhamed that I am become a childe
againe, and worſe then a young man, who doth forge
yeares to himſelfe, and doth dreame of immortalities
in the ſhadow of death. Suffer not this fond confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of lingering ſtill in the earth, inſenſibly to ſteale
away my life from mee, ſo as without thinking on it,
and too late, I ſhall finde my ſelfe at the end of it, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed,
and ſuddenly taken, deſperate and paſt hope;
wherevpon would follow a vaine complaint, to haue
wretchedly caſt away thy graces, to ſee my ſelfe ſhack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with an vnſupportable chaine, and from which I
feare to bee looſed. My life is betweene my lips, why
then ſhould I pant, and ſigh after tranſitory thinges?
What haue I any more to doe with the profits, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3512:109"/>
commodities of this life? My weakeneſſes doe bidd
mee enough to turne my backe to all infamous
lendneſſe and licenciouſneſſe, and, O my God, though
I ſhould be ſtronger then I am, ſhould it bee to offend
thee? My ſight is dimme, and decayes, my hearing is
dull and deaffed; ſhould I reuiue theſe dead ſenſes,
with the remembrance of old pleaſures and new alſo?
O let mee not, with new crimes and ſinnes, increaſe
and adde to mine iniquities paſt! And if thy fauour
hath vpheld mee in my young age, oh let mee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
it in old age, or vilely ſinke into the bottomleſſe
gulfe of death, notwithſtanding ſo many graces of
thine, for which I am bounden and indebted to thine
infinite goodneſſe, and am to make account before thy
iudgement ſeate. Thy holy Angels, ſhall they mourne
euer mee? Thy Spirit, ſhall it be made heauy in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
mee? My conſcience ſhall it accuſe mee, to bee
hypocriticall and malicious? Make this old age (O
Lord) free from ſtupiditie, and ſottiſhneſſe, from pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
from weakeneſſe, talkatiueneſſe, from arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
bragging, doating, from too much niggardſhip,
and from vnneceſſarie, vaine, odious expences; make
me become charitable, honeſt, ſober, temperate, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
mindfull of my neere departure, and deſirous of
that immortalitie, which I hope for. In fine, let my old
age haue nothing that I may feare, nothing that my
friends and enemies may lament or condemne. Let it
be beloued and welcome vnto mee, in that it will make
mee ſhorly to returne into thy heauenly Pallace, where
thou ſhalt wipe away the teares from mine eyes, where I
ſhall ſee my ſelfe deliuered from all ſinnes, filled with
thy grace, and cloſed about with bliſſefull glory, in the
holy company, who there continually magnifie thee.
O my God, deliuer mee from theſe ſo many cares and
miſeries, which doe preſſeme downe, to the end that
at the houre of my departure I may follow thee with
courage. Let this be my meditation continually: Let me
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:3512:109"/>
be releaſed from the vaine imployments, and buſineſſes
of this world, not ſetting my ſelfe to any thing, but that
which directly concernes my calling, and behauing
my ſelfe in ſuch ſort, that both thoſe which dwell neere
me, and thoſe which are farre and remote from mee,
may from my behauiours and carriage, take example of
pietie, iuſt dealing, and holy manners. Let mee bee an
enemie to Atheiſme, and ſuperſtition, and ſincerely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to thy ſeruice, according to the rules of thy word.
Graunt me I beſeech thee this grace, that I may care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
meditate on whatſoeuer I haue vnderſtood, or
perceiued of thy wiſedome, power, and mercie in the
wayes of my life. That I may euery day learne that,
whereof to be ignorant, it would be both ſhamefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me, and dangerous.</p>
               <p>Aboue all roote out of my heart all wicked guile and
craft, and graunt me the grace to walke before thee in a
ſincere and honeſt heart, hating euill in my ſelfe more
then in an other, to bee a louer of plaine dealing, of
peace, of equitie, of meekeneſſe, of puritie, of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie
of life. Let theſe be the ornaments of mine age,
and let thy ſpirit ſo direct, comfort, and ſtrengthen me,
that I may not be too much deiected, though I become
deafe, blind, weake, &amp; lame. Onely let me haue ſtrength
left and remaining, to prayſe and call vpon thee to the
laſt gaſpe, ſo as the weakeneſſes and decayes of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
may be borne vp by the ſupply of thy graces in
my ſoule, which deſires not to be and remaine in this
priſon, but to bleſſe and prayſe thee. Suffer me not to
conceite ſtill on moneths and yeares, but that at euery
ſteppe and moment of tyme, I may remember my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
out of this preſent life, that my whole thought
may be, that I muſt once pay this debt, leaſt being ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely
taken, I caſt away my ſoule. When then the
appoynted tyme ſhall come, graunt I beſeech thee, that
I may ioyfully depart, and with fervent deſire lift vp
my ſelfe to thee. Let thy goodneſſe, O Lord my God,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3512:110"/>
cauſe me to imploy my laſt dayes to the ſtudie and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
hereof, not fearing to leaue and reſigne this
life, whereby I ſhall no more offend thee, but ſhall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
thee continually. The apprehenſion of ſo happie
a day, which ſhall be the birth day of my eternall and
vnſpeakeable bleſſed being, let it make mee to reioyce
before thee my Lord, my God, my heauenly Father,
thorough Ieſus Chriſt thy ſonne my redeemer. Amen.</p>
               <p>O Eternall God and almightie, heauenly Father and
mercifull, which haſt beene my hope from the firſt
day of my life, and during all the courſe of the ſame,
and vntill this great age haſt by infinite wayes, cauſed
me to feele thy prouidence, care, and protection, thou
art he to whom I haue recourſe as to my God, my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
my ſaluation. My legges are feeble, but I lift vp my
ſelfe vpon the winges of my thoughts, even vnto thee,
who art my ſtrength in infirmitie, my light in ſo great
darkneſſe of my vnderſtanding, my life in death which
compaſſeth me about, beſeeching thee to be pleaſed to
forget the ſinnes of my youth, and to haue no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of my tranſgreſſions, but remember thy
faithfull promiſes, to looke vpon the woundes and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings
of thy ſonne my pledge and Sauiour, for whoſe
loue be pleaſed to pardon mine iniquities. Suffer mee
not, O my God, for euer to caſt thee off and forſake
thee. Be pleaſed to annoynt the eyes of my ſoule with
the ſalue of thy ſpirit, that I may continually behold
thee, and that acknowledging my ſelfe a poore way-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
man, and a ſtranger in this world, as all my fathers
were, I may earneſtly aſpire to thee, and to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
where the bleſſed are, and where thou haſt prepared
a place for all thine elect. Graunt that I may ſee my
ſelfe deliuered out of the waues and ſtormes of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Sea of this world: O Lord teach mee to know
mine end, and the number of my dayes, to the end
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3512:110"/>
that ſeeing that the flouriſhing ſtate of this humaine life
hath no abiding, but is compaſſed with ſorrowes, and
oppreſſed with labours and paines, and then the more
dangerous when we leaſt feele them, I may giue my ſelfe
to the ſtudie and exerciſe of that wiſedome, which doth
teach me to renounce the world, and my ſelfe, and to
meditate vpon the heauenly happineſſe of thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
to the end that my heart may be there where
my treaſure is, the head and ſpouſe of the
Church, and where thou haſt prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for them which loue thee
incomprehenſible joyes,
