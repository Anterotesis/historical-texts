         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(before the froſt begin) they go downe with
their boates into the Bay of S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> to a
cape called <hi>Cuſconeſſe</hi> or <hi>Foxnoſe,</hi> where they
leaue their boates till the next ſpring tide.
When the ſunne waxeth warme towarde
the ſpring, and yet the yſe not melted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

Then drawing their boates ouer the ſea yſe,
they vſe them for houſes to reſt and lodge
in. There are commonly about 17. or 18.
fleete of them, of great large boates, which
diuide themſelues into diuers companies,
fiue or ſix boates in a conſort.</p>
            <p>They that firſt finde the haunt, fire a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,

            <p>The manner of the Seals is, when they ſee

fall to ſharing euery boate his part in equall

well knowen, and of very late memorie. The
chiefe of that houſe that aduaunced the

the three laſt that raigned before this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
to wit. <hi>Iuan Baſileus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iuan</hi> father to

the whole ſtocke and race concluded in one,
two or ſome fewe of the bloud. For beſides
the Emperour that now is, who hath no
childe (neither is like euer to haue for ought

more vz. a child of ſixe or ſeuen yeares old,
in whom reſteth all the hope of the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and the poſteritie of that houſe. As for
the other brother that was eldeſt of the

of a blowe giuen him by his father vpon the

(as ſome ſay) of a thruſt with the prong of

him no ſuch mortall harme when hee gaue

left him till it brought him to the graue.
Wherein may be marked the iuſtice of God,
that puniſhed his delight in ſhedding of

houſe of the <hi>Nagaies:</hi> yet not ſafe (as I haue

of ſome that aſpire to the ſucceſsion, if
this Emperour die without any iſſue. The
nurſe that taſted before him of certaine meat
(as I haue heard) died preſently. That hee is
naturall ſonne to <hi>Ioan Vaſilowich,</hi> the <hi>Ruſſe</hi>
people warrant it, by the Fathers qualitie that
beginneth to appeare already in his tender
yeares. He is delighted (they ſay) to ſee ſheepe
and other cattel killed, and to looke on their
throtes while they are bleeding (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
children are afraid to beholde) and
to beate geeſe and hennes with a ſtaffe till
he ſee them lie dead. Beſides theſe of the
male kind, there is a widdow, that hath right
in the ſucceſsion, ſiſter to the old Emperour,
and aunt to this man, ſomtime wife to <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
Duke of <hi>Holſt,</hi> brother to the king of
<hi>Denmarke,</hi> by whom ſhee had one daughter.
This woman ſince the death of hir huſband
hath bene allured again into <hi>Ruſsia</hi> by ſome

which appeareth by the ſequele. For hir ſelfe

Emperour that now is (the better to entend
his deuotions) referreth al ſuch matters per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning
to the State, wholly to the ordering
of his wiues brother, the L. <hi>Borris Federo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich
<pb facs="tcp:2440:25"/>
Godonoe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the like is to be ſaid of the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
concerning matters iudiciall, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſuch as concerne life and death.
Wherein there is none that hath anie au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
or publike iuriſdiction that goeth
by diſcent, or is held by charter, but all at
the appoyntment and pleaſure of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and the ſame practiſed by the iudges
with ſuch awe and reſtraint, as that they
dare not determine vpon anie ſpeciall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but muſt referre the ſame wholly, vp
to the <hi>Mosko</hi> to the Emperours Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.
To ſhewe his Soueraintie ouer the liues
of his ſubiects, the late Emperour <hi>Iuan Vaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowich</hi>
in his walkes or progreſſes, if hee had
miſliked the face or perſon of any man who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hee met by the way, or that looked vpon
him, would command his head to be ſtrook
off. Which was preſently done, and the head
caſt before him.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, for the ſoueraigne appeale, and
giuing of pardons in criminall matters to
ſuch as are conuicted, it is wholly at the
pleaſure and grace of the Emperour. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
alſo the Empreſſe that nowe is, being a
woman of great clemencie, and withall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
to deale in publike affaires of the
Realme, (the rather to ſupply the defect of
her husband) doeth behaue her ſelfe after an
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2440:25"/>
abſolute manner, giuing out pardon (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
on hir byrth, day and other ſolemne
times) in her owne name, by open procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
without any mention at all of the
Emperour. Some there haue beene of late
of the auncient Nobilitie, that haue held
diuers prouinces by right of inheritaunce,
with an abſolute authoritie and iuriſdiction
ouer them, to order and determine all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
within their owne precinct without all
appeale, or controlment of the Emperour.
But this was all annulled and wrung cleane
from them by <hi>Iuan Vaſilowich</hi> father to this
Emperour.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2440:27"/>
propounded. Commonly it is to this effect.
<hi>That the Emperour and his Councell are of great

therefore it may pleaſe them to proceede. That
inſteede of their aduiſe, they will aide them with
their prayers, as their dueties and vocations doe
require, &amp;c.</hi> To this or like effect hauing
made their anſweres euery man in his courſe,
vp ſtandeth ſome Abbot or Frier more bold
then the reſt (yet appointed before hand as
a matter of forme) and deſireth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour

by his <hi>Deiake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereto is replied by the ſaide Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

with thoſe of his noble Councell, vpon good

to be verie good and neceſſarie for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

for aſmuch as they as religious men, &amp; know what
is right, his Maieſtie requireth their godiie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2440:27"/>
therefore deſireth them againe to ſpeake their
mindes freely. And if they ſhal like to giue their
conſents, that then the matters may paſſe to a full

            <p>Hereunto when the Cleargie men haue
giuen their conſents (which they vſe to do
without any great pauſing) they take their
leaues with bleſsing of the Emperour: who
bringeth the Patriarch on his way ſo farre as

theſe in their order. 1. The
<hi>Nobilitie</hi> which is of foure
ſortes. Whereof the chiefe
for birth, authoritie, and reuenue are called
the <hi>Vdelney Knazey,</hi> that is, the exempt or
priuiledged Dukes. Theſe held ſometime a
ſeueral iuriſdiction, and abſolute authorite
within their precincts, much like vnto the
States or Nobles of <hi>Germany.</hi> But afterwards
(reſeruing their rights vpon compoſition)
they yeelded themſelues to this houſe of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ala,</hi>
when it began to waxe mightie, and to
enlarge it ſelf by ouermatching their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
Onely they were bound to ſerue the
Emperour in his warres with a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of horse. But the late Emperour <hi>Iuan Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilowich</hi>
father to this prince, being a man of
high ſpirit, and ſubtill in his kind meaning
to reduce his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t into a more ſtrickt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2440:28"/>
forme beganne by degrees to clip of their
greatnes, &amp; to bring it downe to a leſſer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion:
till in the end he made them not
onely his vaſſals, but his <hi>Kolophey,</hi> that is, his
very villains or bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſlaues. For ſo they terme
and write themſelues in anie publike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
or priuate petition which they
make to the Emperour. So that now they
holde their authorities, landes, liues and
all at the Emperours pleaſure, as the reſt
doe.</p>
            <p>The meanes and practiſe whereby hee
wrought this to effect againſt thoſe, &amp; other
of the Nobility (ſo well as I could note out
of the report of his doings) were theſe, and
ſuch like. Firſt, he caſt priuate emulations
among them about preroragatiue of their
titles, and dignities. Wherein hee vſed to
ſet on the inferiours, to preferre or equall
themſelues to thoſe that were accounted to
bee of the nobler houſes. Where he made
his aduanntage of their malice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
the one againſt the other, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
deuiſed matter, and accuſations of
ſecrete practiſe and conſpiracies to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt his perſon, and ſtate. And
ſo hauing ſingled out the greateſt of them,
and cut them off with the good liking of
the reſt, hee fell at laſt to open practiſe,
by forcing of the other to yeeld their rights
<pb facs="tcp:2440:29"/>
vnto him.</p>
            <p>2 Hee deuided his ſubiectes into two
partes or factions by a general ſchiſme.<note place="margin">The factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Oppreſſini</hi> &amp; <hi>Zempskey</hi> deuiſed by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note> The
one part hee called the <hi>Oppreſſini</hi> or <hi>Select
men.</hi> Theſe were ſuch of the Nobilitie and
Gentrie as he tooke to his owne part to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
and mainteyne them as his faithful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
The other hee called <hi>Zemskey,</hi> or the
<hi>Commons. The Zemskey</hi> conteyned the baſe
and vulgar ſort, with ſuch Noblemen and
Gentlemen as he meant to cut off, as ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to miſlike his gouernment, and to haue
a meaning to practiſe againſt him. Wherein
he prouided that the <hi>Oppreſſini</hi> for number
and qualitie of valure, money, armour, &amp;c:
farre exceeded the other of the <hi>Zempskey</hi>
ſide, whom he put (as it were) from vnder his
protection: ſo that if any of them were ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
or killed by thoſe of the <hi>Oppreſſini</hi> (which
hee accounted of his owne part) there was
no amendes to bee ſought for by way of
publike iuſtice, or by complaint to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>
            <p>The whole number of both partes was
orderly regiſtred and kept in a booke: ſo
that euery man knewe who was a <hi>Zempskey</hi>
man, and who of the <hi>Oppreſſini.</hi> And this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of the one part to ſpoyle and kill the
other without anie helpe of Magiſtrate, or
lawe (that continued ſeuen yeeres) enriched
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2440:29"/>
that ſide, and the Emperours treaſurie, and
wrought that withall which hee intended
by this practiſe, viz. to take out of the way
ſuch of the Nobilitie, as himſelf miſliked:
whereof were ſlayne within one weeke to
the number of three hundred within the
citie of <hi>Mosko.</hi> This tyrannicall practiſe
of making a generall Schiſme, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
diuiſion among the ſubiects of his whole
Realme, proceeded (as ſhould ſeeme) from
an extreame doubt, and deſperate feare,
which hee had conceiued of moſt of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
and Gentlemen of his Realme, in his
warres with the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Chrim Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</hi>
What time hee grewe into a vehement
ſuſpition (conceiued of the ill ſucceſſe of
his affayres) that they practiſed treaſon with
the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Chrim.</hi> Whereupon he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
ſome, and deuiſed this way to be ridde
of the reſt.</p>
            <p>And this wicked pollicy &amp; tyrannous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
(though now it be ceaſſed) hath ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
that countrey, and filled it ſo full of
grudge &amp; mortall hatred euer ſince, that it
wil not be quenched (as it ſeemeth now) till
it burne againe into a ciuill flame.</p>
            <p>3 Hauing thus pulled them and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all their inheritaunce, landes, priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
&amp;c. ſaue ſome verie ſmall part which
he left to their name, hee gaue them other
<pb facs="tcp:2440:30"/>
landes of the tenour of <hi>Pomeſtnay</hi> (as they
call it) that are helde at the Emperours
pleaſure, lying farre of in an other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and ſo remoued them into other of
his Prouinces, where they might haue
neyther fauour, nor authoritie, not being
natiue nor well knowen there. So that now
theſe of the chiefe Nobilitie (called <hi>Vdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
Knazey</hi>) are equalled with the reſt: ſaue
that in the opinion and fauour of the people
they are of more account, and keepe ſtil the
prerogatiue of their place in al their publike
meetings.</p>
            <p>Their practiſe to keepe downe theſe
houſes from riſing againe and recouering
their dignities are theſe, and ſuch like. Firſt,
many of their heires are kept vnmaried per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
that the ſtocke may die with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Some
are ſent into <hi>Siberia, Cazan</hi> and <hi>Aſtracan,</hi>

by pretence of a vowe to be made volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
and of their owne accord, but indeede
forced vnto it by feare, vpon ſome pretenſed

Couent it ſelfe (vpon whoſe head it ſtandeth

haue no hope but to ende their liues there.

onely. For their order is to deliuer their
names and titles of their dignities ouer to all
their children alike, what ſoeuer elſe they
leaue them. So that the ſonnes of a <hi>Voiauodey</hi>

though they neuer ſaw the field, and the ſons
of a <hi>Knez</hi> or Duke are called <hi>Knazey</hi> though

Of this ſort there are ſo many that the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

diſſent, they may appeale, and goe farther to

            <p>Thirdly, if there be any publike ſeruice to
be done within that Prouince, (as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing

with the people, where they gouerne,
being neither borne, nor brought vp among
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:2440:35"/>
them, not yet hauing inheritance of their

they haue for that ſeruice an 100.
markes a yeare, he that hath moſt, ſome fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
ſome but thirtie. Which maketh them
more ſuſpected &amp; odious to the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
being ſo bare, and comming freſh and
hungrie vpon them lightly euery yeare, they
rack &amp; ſpoile them without all regard of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
or conſcience. Which is eaſily tollerated
by the chiefe officers of the <hi>Chetfirds,</hi> to the
end they may rob them againe &amp; haue a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
bootie when they call them to account:
which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly they doo at the end of their
ſeruice, making an adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage of their iniuſtice
&amp; oppreſsion ouer the poore people. There
are few of them but they come to the <hi>Pudkey</hi>
or whip when their time is ended, which
themſelues for the moſt parte doo make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of. And therefore they furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with all the ſpoile they can for the time
of their gouernment, that they may haue
for both turnes, aſwel for the Emperour, and
Lord of the <hi>Chetfird,</hi> as to reſerue ſome good
part for themſelues.</p>
            <p>They that are appointed to gouerne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
are men of this qualitie: ſaue that in
the foure border townes that are of greateſt
importance, are ſet men of more ſpeciall
valure and truſt two in euery towne. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb facs="tcp:2440:36"/>
one is euer of the Emperours priuie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.
Theſe foure border townes are <hi>Smolens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko,
Vobsko, Nouogrod,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cazan,</hi> whereof three
lie towards the <hi>Polonian</hi> &amp; <hi>Sweden,</hi> one bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth

haue larger co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſsion then the other Dukes
of the Prouinces that I ſpake of before, and
may doo execution in criminall matters.
Which is thought behoofull for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwelth:
for incident occaſions that may
happen vpon the borders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that are far of, &amp;
may not ſtay for direction, about euery oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
and particular matter from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
and his Counſell. They are chaunged
euery yeare (except as before) and haue for

            <p>Onely for their ordinary matters (as buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,<note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of <hi>Mosko.</hi>
               </note>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:2440:36"/>
two Gentlemen, &amp; two Dyacks or Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,

his ſeruant of theft or like matter, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he may bring him to haue him exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vpon the <hi>Pudkey,</hi> or other torture. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
theſe two Gentlemen, and Secretaries
that order the whole Citie, there are <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſts</hi>
or Aldermen for euerie ſeuerall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie.
The Alderman hath his <hi>Sotskey</hi> or
Conſtable, and the Conſtable hath certeine
<hi>Decetskeis</hi> or Decurions vnder him, which
haue the ouerſight of ten houſholds a peece,
whereby euerie diſorder is ſooner ſpide, and
the common ſeruice hath the quicker diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pach.
The whole number of Citizens poore
and rich are reduced into companies. The
chiefe officers (as the Dyacks and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men)
are appointed by the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
the <hi>Staruſt</hi> by the Gentlemen and Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks,
the <hi>Sotskoy</hi> by the <hi>Staruſt</hi> or Alderman,
and the <hi>Decetskoies</hi> by the Conſtables.</p>
            <p>This manner of gouernment of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
and townes, if it were aſwell ſet for
the giuing of iuſtice indifferently to al ſorts,
as it is to preuent innouations, by keeping
of the Nobilitie within order, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in ſubiection, it might ſeeme in that
kinde to bee no bad nor vnpollitique way,
<pb facs="tcp:2440:37"/>
for the conteyning of ſo large a Common-wealth,
of that breadth and length as is the
kingdome of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> But the oppreſſion
and ſlauerie is ſo open, and ſo great, that a
man would maruell how the Nobilitie and
people ſhoulde ſuffer themſelues to bee
brought vnder it, while they had any means
to auoid and repulſe it or being ſo ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as it is at this preſent, how the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
themſelues can be content to practiſe
the ſame, with ſo open iniuſtice and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of their ſubiects, being themſelues of a
Chriſtian profeſsion.</p>
            <p>By this it appeareth how harde a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it were to alter the ſtate of the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,<note place="margin">An harde matter to alter the State of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi>
               </note>
as now it ſtandeth. Firſt, becauſe
they haue none of the Nobilitie able to
make head. As for the Lords of the foure
<hi>Chetfirds</hi> or <hi>Tetrarchies</hi> they are men of no
Nobilitie, but Dyacks aduanced by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
depending on his fauour, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
onely about his owne perſon. And for
the Dukes that are appointed to gouern vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, they are but men of a titular dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
(as was ſaied before) of no power, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
nor credit, ſaue that which they haue
out of the office, for the time they enioy it.
Which doth purchaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no fauour, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hatred of the people, for aſmuch as they
ſee that they are ſet ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not ſo much for
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2440:37"/>
any care to doo them right and iuſtice as to
keepe them vnder in a miſerable ſubiection,
and to take the fliece from them, not once in
the yeare (as the owner from his ſheepe) but
to poule and clip them all the yeare long. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the authority &amp; rule which they beare,
is rent and diuided into many ſmall pieces,
being diuers of them in euery great Shire, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
beſides with a very ſhort time: which
giueth them no ſcope to make any ſtrength,
nor to contriue ſuch an enterpriſe, if happily
they intended any matter of innouation. As
for the common people (as may better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in the deſcription of their ſtate &amp; qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
afterwardes ſet downe) beſides their
want of armour &amp; practiſe of warre (which
they are kept from of purpoſe) they are rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
continually both of their harts &amp; mony,
(beſides other means) ſomtimes by pretence
of ſome ſeruice to be done for the common
defence, ſometimes without any ſhewe at
all of any neceſsitie of Common-wealth or
Prince. So that there is no meanes either
for Nobilitie, or people to attempt any inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
ſo long as the militarie forces of the
Emperour which are the number of 8000. at
the leaſt in continuall pay) hold themſelues
faſt and ſure vnto him, and to the preſent

of the qualitie of Souldiours, and enioying
<pb facs="tcp:2440:38"/>
withal that free libertie of wronging &amp; ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the commons at their pleaſure, which
is permitted them of purpoſe, to make them
haue a liking of the preſent ſtate. As for the
agreement of the Souldiers and commons,
it is a thing not to be feared, beyng of ſo
oppoſite and contrarie practiſe much one to
the other. This deſperate ſtate of things at
home, maketh the people for the moſt part
to wiſhe for ſome forreine inuaſion, which

<hi>Zabore,</hi> or high court of Parliament, where
their lawes and publique orders are conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon. Which commonly tend to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion

and proportion of their degrees) are well
contented that the whole burden ſhall light
vpon the commons, ſo they may eaſe their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2440:49"/>
owne ſhoulders by laying all vpon them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
into what ſeruile condition their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is brought, not onely to the Prince, but to
the Nobles, and Gentlemen of the Countrie
(who themſelues alſo are but ſeruile, ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of late yeares) it may farther appeare by
their owne acknowledgments in their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
and other writings to any of the
Nobles or chiefe officers of the Emperours.
Wherein they name and ſubſcribe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<hi>Kolophey,</hi> that is, their villaines, or
bondſlaues: as they of the Nobilitie doo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

of them, that there is no ſeruant nor bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaue
more awed by his Maiſter, nor kept
downe in a more ſeruile ſubiection, then the
poore people are, &amp; that vniuerſally, not only

high way, he muſt turne himſelfe about, as
not daring to looke him on the face, and fall
down with knocking of his head to the very
ground, as he doth vnto his Idoll.</p>
            <p>Secondly concerning the landes, goods,
and other poſſeſsions of the commons they
anſwere the name and lie common indeed
without any fenſe againſt the rapine, and
ſpoile, not onely of the higheſt, but of his
Nobilitie, officers, and ſouldiers. Beſides
<pb facs="tcp:2440:50"/>
the taxes, cuſtomes, ſeazures, and other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique
exactions done vpon them by the
Emperour, they are ſo racked and pulled by
the Nobles, officers, and meſſengers ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
by the Emperour in his publique af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
ſpecially in the <hi>Yammes</hi> (as they call
them) and thorough faire townes, that you

a mile, and a mile long, ſtande all vnhabited
the people being fled all into other places
by reaſon of the extreame vſage and exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
done vpon them. So that in the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Mosko,</hi> betwixt <hi>Vologda</hi> and <hi>Yaruſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueley</hi>
(which is two nineties after their recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

there are in ſigt fiftie <hi>Darieunes</hi> or vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
at the leaſt, ſome halfe a mile, ſome a
mile long (that ſtand vacant) &amp; deſolate with
out any inhabitant. The like is in all other
places of the realme (as is ſaid by thoſe that
haue better trauelled the countrie then my
ſelfe had time, or occaſion to doo.</p>
            <p>The great oppreſsion ouer the poore
Commons, maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue no courage
in following their trades: for that the more
they haue, the more daunger they are in, not
onely of their goods, but of their liues alſo.
And if they haue any thing, they conceale it
all they can, ſomtimes conueying it into Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries,
ſometimes hiding it vnder the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2440:50"/>

In ſo much that many times you ſhall
ſee them afraid to be knowen to any <hi>Boiuren</hi>

haue to ſell. I haue ſeene them ſometimes

for a liking (as their principall furres &amp;
ſuch like) to looke ſtill behind them, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
euery doore: as men in ſome feare, that
looked to be ſet vpon, &amp; ſurpriſed by ſome

            <p>This maketh the people (though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
hardened to beare any toile) to giue
themſelues much to idlenes and drinking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as paſsing for no more, then from hand to

woont to doo: becauſe the people being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
and ſpoiled of their gettings, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
from their laboures. Yet this one
thing is much to be noted, that in all this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion
there were three brethren Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants

They are ſaid to haue paied to the Emperour
for cuſtome to the ſum of 23000. rubbles a
yeare (for which cauſe they were ſuffered to
enioy their trade) beſides the mainteining
of certeine garriſons on the borders of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beria,</hi>
which were neare vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherin the

downe woods from <hi>Wichida</hi> to <hi>Perm,</hi>
aboue a 1000. verſe and then tooke it all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

a <hi>Mouſick,</hi> the Emperour began firſt to

though there ſeemeth to be in them
ſome aptneſſe to receyue any art (as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
by the naturall wittes in the men, and
very children) yet they excell in no kinde of
common arte, much leſſe in any learning,
or litterall kinde of knowledge: which they
are kept from of purpoſe, as they are alſo
from all militarie practiſe: that they may be
fitter for the ſeruile condition, wherein now
they are, and haue neyther reaſon, nor va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
to attempt innouation. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
alſo they are kept from traueling, that
they may learne nothing, nor ſee the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions
of other Countries abroad. You
ſhall ſeldome ſee a <hi>Ruſſe</hi> a traueller, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

he make a ſcape out of his Countrie. Which
hardly he can doo, by reaſon of the borders

for any ſuch attempt, which is
<pb facs="tcp:2440:52"/>
death if he be taken, and all his goods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate.
Onely they learne to write, and to
read, and that very few of them. Neither doo
they ſuffer any ſtraunger willingly to come
into their realme out of any ciuill Countrie,
for the ſame cauſe, farther then neceſsitie of
vttering their commodities, and taking in of
forreine doth enforce them to doo.</p>
            <p>And therefore this yeare 1589. they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
about the remouing of all Marchants
ſtraungers to the border townes,<note place="margin">The ielou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of the Emperour concerning his ſtate.</note> to abide
and haue their reſidencie there, and to bee
more wary in admitting other ſtraungers
hereafter into the Inland parts of the realm,
for feare of infection with better manners
and qualities, then they haue of their owne.
For the ſame purpoſe alſo they are kept
within the boundes of their degree by the
lawes of their countrie: ſo that the ſonne of
a <hi>Mouſick,</hi> artificer, or husbandman, is euer
a <hi>Mouſick</hi> artificer, &amp;c: and hath no means
to aſpire any higher: except hauing learned
to write and read, he attaine to the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a Prieſt, or Dyack. Their language is
all one with the <hi>Slauonian,</hi> which is thought
to haue bene deriued from the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> tongue,
rather then the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> from the <hi>Slauonian.</hi> For
the people called <hi>Sclaui,</hi> are knowen to haue

tongue, ſignifieth as much as <hi>Glory,</hi> or <hi>Fame.</hi>
Though afterwards being ſubdued and trod
vpon by diuers nations, the <hi>Italians</hi> their

ſignification, and terme euery ſeruant
or peaſant by the name of <hi>Sclaue,</hi> as did the

hee declareth the effect of his cauſe, or

vnto him a <hi>Wepis,</hi> or warrant, which
hee deliuereth to the <hi>Praeſtaue,</hi> or Sergeant,
to doo the arreſt vpon the partie whom hee

is to put in ſureties to anſwere the day
appointed, or els ſtandeth at the Sergeants
deuotion, to be kept ſafe by ſuch meanes as
he thinketh good.</p>
            <p>The Sergeants are many, and excell for
their hard and cruell dealing towards their
pryſoners, commonly they clappe irons
vpon them, as many as they can beare, to
wring out of them ſome larger fees. Though
it bee but for ſixe pence, you ſhall ſee them
<pb facs="tcp:2440:54"/>
goe with chaynes on their legges, armes,
and necke. When they come before the
Iudge, the plaintife beginneth to declare
his matter after the content of his ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
As for Attourneis Counſellours, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatours
&amp; Aduocates to plead their cauſe
for them, they haue no ſuch order, but euery
man is to tell his owne tale, and plead for
himſelfe, ſo well as he can.</p>

they produce it before the Iudge. If
they haue none, or if the truth of the cauſe

euidence on both partes: then the Iudge
asketh eyther partie (which hee thinketh
good plaintife or defendant) whether hee
will <hi>kiſſe the Croſſe,</hi> vpon that which he auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,
or denieth. Hee that taketh the
Croſſe (being ſo offered by the Iudge) is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
cleare, and carrieth away the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This ceremonie is not done within the
Court or office, but the partie is carried to
the Church by an officer, and there the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie
is done: the mony in the meane
while hanging vpon a naile, or els lying at
the idols feete, ready to be deliuered to the
partie, as ſoone as he hath kiſſed the Croſſe
before the ſaid Idoll.</p>
            <p>This kiſsing of the Croſſe (called <hi>Creu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina
chelouania</hi>) is as their corporall oath.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2440:54"/>
and accounted with them a very holy thing,<note place="margin">Iudgement by lotte.</note>
which no man will dare to violate, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
with a falſe allegation. If both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
offer to kiſſe the Croſſe in a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie
matter, then they drawe lottes. The
better lotte is ſuppoſed to haue the right,
and beareth away the matter. So the partie
conuicted is adiudged to pay the debt or
penaltie whatſoeuer, and withall to pay the
Emperours fees, which is twentie pence
vpon euery marke, as before hath bene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>When the matter is thus ended, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
conuicted is deliuered to the Sergeant,
who hath a writte for his warrant out of the
office, to carry him to the <hi>Praueuſh</hi> or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Iuſtice, if preſently hee pay not the
monie, or content not the partie. This
<hi>Praueuſh</hi> or Righter, is a place neare to the
office: where ſuch as haue ſentence paſſed
againſt them, and refuſe to pay that which
is adiudged, are beaten with great cudgels
on the ſhinnes, and calues of their legges.
Euery forenoone from eight to eleuen, they
are ſet on the <hi>Praueuſh,</hi> and beate in this
ſort till the monie be payd. The afternoone
and night time, they are kepte in chaines by
the Sergeant: except they put in ſufficient

wherewithall to ſatisfie his creditour, it is
lawfull for him to fell his wife, and children,
eyther out right, or for a certaine terme of
yeares. And if the price of them doo not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to the full payment, the creditour
may take them to bee his bondſlaues, for

drawe of great length, and yeeld great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
to the Iudge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and officers. If the
ſuite be vpon a bond, or bill, they haue for
the moſte parte good and ſpeedy iuſtice.

Vpon this there are witneſſes, Micheta Sydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueskoy,

none.</p>
            <p>When any is taken for a matter of crime
(as treaſon,<note place="margin">Proceeding in criminall matters.</note> murder, thefte, and ſuch like)
hee is firſt brought to the Duke, and Diack,
that are for the Prouince where the partie
is attached, by whom hee is examined. The
manner of examination in ſuch caſes, is all
by torture, as ſcourging with whips made
of ſinowes, or whitleather (called the <hi>Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi>)
as bigge as a mans finger, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
a ſore laſh, and entreth into the fleſh,
or by tying to a ſpit and roſting at the fire,
ſometimes by breaking and wreſting one
of their ribbes with a pavre of hote tongues,
or cutting their fleſh vnder the nayles, and
ſuch like.</p>
            <p>The examination thus taken withall the
proofes, and euidences that can bee allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
againſt the partie, it is ſent vp to the
<hi>Mosko</hi> to the Lord of the <hi>Chetfird</hi> or Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte,
vnder whom the Prouince is, and by
him is preſented to the Counſell table, to
bee read and ſentenced there, where onely
<pb facs="tcp:2440:56"/>
iudgement is giuen in matter of life &amp; death,
and that by euidence vpon information,
though they neuer ſawe nor heard the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
who is kept ſtill in pryſon where the fact

downe by the Lord of the <hi>Chetfird,</hi> to the

the priſoners that are condemned in Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
are kept for the winter, to be knockt
in the head, and put vnder the yſe. This is
to bee vnderſtood of common perſons. For
theft, and murder, if they be committed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a poore <hi>Mouſick</hi> by one of Nobilitie
are not lightly puniſhed, nor yet is hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to any account for it. Their reaſon is,
becauſe they are accounted their <hi>Kolophey,</hi>

or Gentleman ſouldier, a murder or theft
bee committed, peraduenture he ſhal be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2440:56"/>
manner of the fact be verie notorious, he is
whipped perchance, and this is commonly
all the puniſhment that is inflicted vpon
them.</p>
            <p>If a man kill his owne ſeruant little, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is ſaid vnto him, for the ſame reaſon:
becauſe hee is accounted to be his <hi>Kolophey,</hi>

by aduantage of ciuill diſſentions, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

the diſquietnes of his owne ſtate at home.
Onely the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> Emperour, at this time hath
left him on that ſide his countrie, the cities of

of his <hi>Ruſſe</hi> Captaines. But by their
conſpiracies and attempts not long after, he
was taught to deale more ſurely with them.
And ſo comming vpon them the ſecond

three partes of foure, which hee gaue or
ſolde to the <hi>Tartars</hi> that ſerued him in

people (that ſhould haue tilled the ground,

the great townes) out of his owne countrie

when it was finiſhed, for reward to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect

In his foure chiefe border townes of <hi>Vobs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko,
Smolensko, Aſtracan,</hi> and <hi>Cazan,</hi> he hath
certeine of his Counſell not of greateſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
but of greateſt truſt, which haue more
authoritie within their precincts (for the
countenauncing and ſtrengthning of their
gouernment there) then the other Dukes that
are ſet to gouerne in other places, as was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before, in the manner of ordering their

euery yeare, ſometime euery ſecond or third

very ſpeciall truſt, and good liking of the
partie, and his ſeruice: leaſt by enlarging of

               </note>
and that part of <hi>Siberia,</hi> which he hath
now vnder him, they are kept by as eaſie
meanes, as they were firſt got. vz. rather by
ſhewing, then by vſing of armes. Firſt, hee
hath ſtoared the Countrie with as manie
<hi>Ruſſes</hi> as there are natiues, and hath there
ſome fewe ſouldiers in garriſon, inough to
to keepe them vnder. Secondly, his officers
and Magiſtrates there, are of his owne <hi>Ruſſe</hi>
people, and hee chaungeth them very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
vz. euery yeare twiſe or thriſe: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
there bee no great feare of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation.
Thirdly, he deuideth them into
many ſmall gouernments, like a ſtaffe broke
in many ſmall pieces: ſo that they haue no
ſtrength beyng ſeuered, which was but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
neyther when they were all in one.
Fourthly, hee prouideth that the people of
the Countrie haue neither armour, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
beyng taxed and pilled ſo often as hee
thinketh good: without any means to ſhake
of that yoke, or to relieue themſelues.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Siberia</hi> (where he goeth on in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his conqueſt) he hath diuers caſtles and
garriſons, to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of ſix thouſand ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
of <hi>Ruſſes,</hi> and <hi>Polonians,</hi> and ſendeth
many new ſupplies thither, to plant and to
<pb facs="tcp:2440:68"/>
inhabite, as he winneth ground. At this time
beſides he hath gotten the kings brother of
<hi>Siberia,</hi> allured by certeine of his Captaines,
to leaue his owne countrie by offers of great
intertainement, and pleaſanter life with the
<hi>Ruſſe</hi> Emperour, then he had in <hi>Siberia.</hi> He
was brought in this laſte yeare, and is now
with the Emperour at <hi>Mosko</hi> well intertey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>This may be ſayd of the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> practize,
whereſoeuer he ruleth, either by right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
or by conqueſt. Firſt, he berie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
the countrie of armour &amp; other means
of defence, which he permitteth to none, but
to his <hi>Botarskies</hi> onely. Secondly, he robbeth
them continually of their monie, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
and leaueth them bare with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but their bodies, and liues, within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
yeares compaſſe. Thirdly, he renteth
and deuideth his territories into many ſmall
pieces by ſeuerall gouernments: ſo that none
hath much vnder him to make any ſtrength,
though he had other oportunities. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he gouerneth his Countries by men of
ſmall reputation, &amp; no power of themſelues,
and ſtraungers in thoſe places where their
gouernment lieth. Fiftly, he chaungeth his
gouernours once a yeare ordinarily, that
there grow no great liking nor intierneſſe
betwixt the people and them, nor acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:2440:68"/>
with the enemy if they lie towards the
borders. Sixtly, he appointeth in one and
the ſame place aduerſarie gouernours, the
one to bee as Controller of the other, as
the Dukes and Diacks: where (by meanes
of their enuies and emulations) there is
leſſe hurt to bee feared by their agreement,
and himſelfe is better infourmed what is
done amiſſe. Seuenthly, he ſendeth many
times into euery Prouince ſecrete meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of ſpeciall truſt about him as intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to prie and harken out what is doing,
and what is a miſſe there. And this is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
though it be ſodaine, and vnknowen
what time they will come.</p>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2440:71"/>
leaue the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie deſolate to the poſſeſsion
of ſo vile &amp; barbarous an enimie, as was the
<hi>Tartar</hi> nation, terming themſelues in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull
manner. For notwithſtanding he
had loſt his carriages, with ſome fewe ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
that had marched diſorderly, yet hee
doubted not but to recouer that loſſe, with
the acceſſe of a notable victorie, if the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
<hi>Tartar</hi> durſt abide him in the fielde.
To this purpoſe hauing written their letters
in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> character, by certaine young
men whom they tooke in the field, &amp; ſigned
them with the Kings ſeale, they diſpatched
them foorth to all the quarters of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi>
that lay neare about the place. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Vngarians,</hi> that were now flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with their goods, wiues, &amp; children vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the rumour of the Kings ouerthrow, taking
comfort of theſe counterfait letters, ſtayed
at home. And ſo were made a pray, being
ſurpriſed on the ſuddaine by this huge num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of theſe <hi>Tartars,</hi> that had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed them
about before they were aware.</p>
            <p>When they beſiege a towne or fort, they
offer much parle, and ſende many flattering
meſſages to perſwade a ſurrendry: promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
all things that the inhabitants will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire:
but beyng once poſſeſſed of the place,
they vſe all manner of hoſtilitie, and eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie.
This they doo vppon a rule they
<pb facs="tcp:2440:72"/>
haue, vz: that Iuſtice is to be practiſed but
towardes their owne. They encounter not
lightly, but they haue ſome ambuſh, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
(hauing once ſhewed themſelues, and
made ſome ſhort co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flict, they retire as repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
for feare, and ſo draw the enimie into it
if they can. But the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> being wel acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with their practiſe, is more warie of them.
When they come a rouing with ſome ſmall
number, they ſet on horſebacke counterfait
ſhapes of men, that their number may ſeeme
greater.</p>
            <p>When they make any onſet, their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is to make a great ſhoote, crying all out
together <hi>Olla Billa, Olla Billa, God helpe vs,
God helpe vs.</hi> They contemne death ſo much,
as that they chuſe rather to die, then to yeeld
to their enimie, and are ſeene when they are
ſlaine to bite the very weapon, when they
are paſt ſtriking, or helping of themſelues.
Wherein appeareth how different the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
is in his deſperate courage from the
<hi>Ruſſe,</hi> and <hi>Turke.</hi> For the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> Souldier if
he begin once to retire putteth all his ſafety
in his ſpeedie flight. And if once he be taken
by his enemie, he neyther defendeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
nor intreateth for his life, as recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
ſtraight to die. The <hi>Turke</hi> commonly
when he is paſt hope of eſcaping, falleth to
intreatie, and caſteth awaie his weapon,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:2440:72"/>
offereth both his handes, and holdeth them
vp, as it were to be tyed: hoping to ſaue his
life, by offering himſelfe bondſlaue.</p>
            <p>The chiefe bootie the <hi>Tartars</hi> ſeeke for
in all their warres, is to get ſtore of captiues,
ſpecially yong boyes, and girls, whom they
ſell to the <hi>Turkes,</hi> or other their neighbors.
To this purpoſe they take with them great
baskets made like bakers panniers to carrie
them tenderly, and if any of them happen to
tyer, or to be ſicke on the way, they daſh
him againſt the ground, or ſome tree, and
ſo leaue him dead: The ſouldiers are not
troubled with keeping the captiues, and the
other bootie, for hindering the execution
of their warres, but they haue certein bands
that intend nothing els, appointed of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to receiue, and keepe the captiues and
the other praye.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ruſſe</hi> borders (being vſed to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaſions
lightly euery yeere in the ſommer)
keepe fewe other cattel on the border parts,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartar</hi> religion.</note>
ſaue ſwine onely, which the <hi>Tartar</hi> will not
touch, nor driue away with him: for that he
is of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> religion, and will eate no
ſwines fleſh. Of Chriſt our Sauiour they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
aſmuch as doeth the <hi>Turke</hi> in his Alka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
vz. that hee came of the Angell <hi>Gabriel,</hi>
and the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> that hee was a great
Prophet, and ſhalbe the Iudge of the world
<pb facs="tcp:2440:73"/>
at the laſt day. In other matters likewiſe, they
are much ordered after the manner and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the <hi>Turke:</hi> hauing felt the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi>
forces when hee wonne from them <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zou,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Caffa,</hi> with ſome other townes about
the <hi>Euxine,</hi> or <hi>Blacke ſea,</hi> that were before
tributaries to the <hi>Chrim Tartar.</hi> So that now
the Emperour of the <hi>Chrims</hi> for the moſt
part is choſen ſome one of the Nobilitie
whom the <hi>Turke</hi> doeth commend: whereby
it is brought nowe to that paſſe, that the
<hi>Chrim Tartar</hi> giueth to the <hi>Turke</hi> the tenth
part of the ſpoyle, which hee getteth in his
warres againſt the Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Herein they differ from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
for that they haue certeine idole pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
made of ſilke, or like ſtuffe, of the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a man, which they faſten to the doore
of their walking houſes, to be as <hi>Ianuſſes</hi> or
keepers of their houſe. And theſe idols are
made not by all, but by certeine religious
women, which they haue among them for
that, &amp; like vſes. They haue beſides the image
of their King or great <hi>Cham,</hi> of an huge big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
which they erect at euery ſtage: when the
army marcheth: &amp; this euery one muſt bend
and bowe vnto as hee paſſeth by it, bee
he <hi>Tartar,</hi> or ſtranger. They are much giuen
to witchcraft, &amp; ominous coniectures, vpon
euery accident which they heare, or ſee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:2440:73"/>
In making of mariages they haue no
regard of alliance or conſanguinitie. Onely
with his mother, ſiſter, and daughter a man
may not marrie, and though hee take the
woman into his houſe, and accompany with
her, yet hee accounteth her not for his wife,
till he haue a childe by her. Then he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to take a dowrie of her friendes of
horſe, ſheepe, kyne, &amp;c. If ſhe be barren after
a certeine time, he turneth her home againe.</p>
            <p>Vnder the Emperour they haue certeine
Dukes,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartar</hi> Nobilitie.</note> whome they call <hi>Morſeis</hi> or <hi>Diuoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſeis:</hi>
that rule ouer a certeine number of
10000. 20000. or 40000. a piece, which they
call <hi>hoords.</hi> When the Emperour hath any
vſe of them to ſerue in his warres, they are
bound to come, &amp; to bring with them their
ſouldiers to a certeine nomber, euery man
with his two horſe at the leaſt, the one to
ride on, the other to kill, when it commeth
to his turne to haue his his horſe eate. For
their chiefe vittaile is horſe fleſh,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tartar</hi> dyet.</note> which they
eate without bread, or any other thing with
it. So that if a <hi>Tartar</hi> be taken by a <hi>Ruſſe,</hi> he
ſhall be ſure lightly to finde a horſe legge, or
ſome other part of him at his ſaddle bow.</p>
            <p>This laſt yeere when I was at the <hi>Mosko,</hi>
came in one <hi>Kiriach Morſey,</hi> nephewe to the
Emperour of the <hi>Chrims</hi> that now is (whoſe
father was Emperour before) accompanied
<pb facs="tcp:2440:74"/>
with 300. <hi>Tartars,</hi> and his two wiues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
one was his brothers widdow. Where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
intertained in very good ſort after the
<hi>Ruſſe</hi> manner; hee had ſent vnto his lodging
for his welcome, to bee made ready for his
ſupper and his companies, two very large
and fatte horſes, ready flawed in a ſledde.
They preferre it before other fleſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the meate is ſtronger (as they ſay)
then beefe, mutton, and ſuch like. And
yet (which is marueile) though they ſerue all
as horſemen in the warres, and eate all of
horſe fleſh, there are brought yeerely to the
<hi>Mosko</hi> to be exchanged for other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
30. or 40. thouſand <hi>Tartar</hi> horſe, which
they call <hi>Cones.</hi> They keepe alſo great heards
of kine, and flockes of blacke ſheepe, rather
for the skins and milke (which they carry
with them in great bottels) then for the vſe
of the fleſh, though ſometimes they eate of
it. Some vſe they haue of ryſe figs, and other
fruites. They drinke milke or warme blood,
and for the moſt part carde them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
They vſe ſometimes as they traueile
by the way, to let their horſe blood in a
vain, and to drinke it warme, as it commeth
from his body.</p>
            <p>Townes they plant none,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> nor other ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
buildings, but haue walking houſes
which the Latines call <hi>Veij,</hi> built vpon
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:2440:74"/>
wheeles like a ſhepheards cottage. Theſe
they drawe with them whitherſoeur they
goe, driuing their cattaile with them. And
when they come to their ſtage, or ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
place, they plant their cart houſes very
orderly in a ranke: and ſo make the forme of
ſtreetes, and of a large towne. And this is the
manner of the Emperour himſelfe, who hath
no other ſeat of his Empire but an <hi>Agora,</hi> or
towne of wood, that moueth with him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoeuer
hee goeth. As for the fixed and
ſtanding building vſed in other countreys,
they ſay they are vnwholſome and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant.</p>
            <p>They beginne to mooue their houſes and
cattaile in the ſpring time from the South
part of their Countrey towards the North
parts. And ſo driuing on til they haue graſed
all vp to the fartheſt part Northwarde, they
returne backe againe towardes their South
countrey (where they continue all the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
by ten or twelue miles a ſtage: in the
meane while the graſſe being ſprung vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
to ſerue for their cattaile as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne.
From the border of the <hi>Shalcan</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea, to the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> frontiers,
they haue a goodly Countrey, ſpecially on
the South and Southeaſt partes, but loſt for
lacke of tillage.</p>
            <p>Of money they haue no vſe at all, and
<pb facs="tcp:2440:75"/>
therefore preferre braſſe and ſteele before
other mettals, ſpecially bullate, which they
vſe for ſwords, kniues, and other neceſſaries.
As for golde and ſiluer they neglect it of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
purpoſe, (as they doe all tillage of their
ground) to be more free for their wandring
kinde of life, and to keepe their Countrey
leſſe ſubiect to inuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Which giueth them
great aduantage againſt all their neighbors,
euer inuading, &amp; neuer being inuaded. Such
as haue taken vpon them to inuade their
Countrey (as of olde time <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius
Hyſtaſpis,</hi> on the Eaſt and Southeaſt ſide)
haue done it with very ill ſucceſſe: as we find
in the ſtories written of thoſe times. For
their manner is when any will inuade them,
to allure and drawe them on by flying and
reculing (as if they were afraide) till they
haue drawen them ſome good way within
their countrey. Then when they beginne to
want vittaile and other neceſſaries (as needs
they muſt where nothing is to bee had) to
ſtoppe vp the paſſages, and incloſe them
with multitudes. By which ſtratagem (as we
reade in <hi>Laonicus Chalcacondylas</hi> in his <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi>
ſtorie) they had welnigh ſurpriſed the
great aud huge armie of <hi>Tamerlan,</hi> but that
hee retyred with all ſpeede hee coulde, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
the riuer <hi>Tanais,</hi> or <hi>Don,</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
great loſſe of his men, and carriages.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:2440:75"/>
In the ſtorie of <hi>Pachymerius</hi> the <hi>Greeke</hi>
(which he wrote of the Emperours of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi>
from the beginning of the reigne
of <hi>Michael Palaeologus</hi> to the time of <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi>
the elder) I remember hee telleth to
the ſame pourpoſe of one <hi>Nogas</hi> a <hi>Tartari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
captaine vnder <hi>Cazan</hi> the Emperour of
the Eaſt <hi>Tartars</hi> (of whome the Citie and
kingdome of <hi>Cazan</hi> may ſeeme to haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the denomination) who refuſed a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of Pearle and other iewels ſent vnto
him from <hi>Michael Palaeologus:</hi> asking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
for what vſe they ſerued, and whither
they were good to keepe away ſickneſſe,
death, or other misfortunes of this life, or
no. So that it ſeemeth they haue, euer or
long time bene of that minde to value things
no further, then by the vſe, and neceſsitie
for which they ſerue.</p>
            <p>For perſon and complexion they haue
broad and flatte viſages, of a tanned colour
into yellowe and blacke, fearſe and cruell
lookes, thin haired vpon the vpper lippe,
and pitte of the chinne, light and nimble
bodied, with ſhort legges, as if they were
made naturally for horſemen: whereto they
practiſe themſelues from their childehood,
ſeldome going afoote about any buſineſſe.
Their ſpeach is very ſuddaine and loude,
ſpeaking as it were out of a deepe hollowe
<pb facs="tcp:2440:76"/>
throate. When they ſing you woulde thinke
a kowe lowed, or ſome great bandogge
howled. Their greateſt exerciſe is ſhooting,
wherein they traine vp their children from
their very infancie, not ſuffering them to
eate, til they haue ſhot neere the marke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a certein ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tling. They are the very ſame
that ſometimes were called <hi>Scythae Noma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
or the <hi>Scythian Shepheards,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks</hi>
and <hi>Latines.</hi> Some thinke that the <hi>Turkes</hi>
tooke their beginning from the nation of
the <hi>Chrim Tartars.</hi> Of which opinion is <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus
Chalcocondylas</hi> the <hi>Greeke</hi> Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher,
in his firſt booke of his <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi>
ſtorie. Wherein hee followeth diuers
very probable coniectures: The firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the very name it ſelfe, for that
the worde <hi>Turke</hi> ſignifieth a ſhepheard, or
one that foloweth a vagrant and wilde kinde
of life By which name theſe <hi>Scythian Tartars</hi>
haue euer bene noted, being called by the

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or the <hi>Scythian</hi> ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards.
His ſecond reaſon, becauſe the <hi>Turks</hi>
(in his time) that dwelt in <hi>Aſia the leſſe,</hi> to
wit, in <hi>Lydia, Coria, Phrygia,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia,</hi>
ſpake the very ſame language that theſe <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi>
did, that dwelt betwixt the riuer <hi>Tanais</hi>
or <hi>Don.</hi> and the countrey of <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> which
(as is well knowen) are theſe <hi>Tartars</hi> called
<hi>Chrims.</hi> At this time alſo the whole nation
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2440:76"/>
of the <hi>Turkes</hi> differ not much in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſpeach from the <hi>Tartar</hi> la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe the <hi>Turke</hi> and the <hi>Chrim Tartar</hi>
agree ſo well together, aſwell in religion, as
in matter of traffique neuer inuading, or
iniurying one another: ſaue that the <hi>Turke</hi>
(ſince <hi>Laonicus</hi> his time) hath encroached vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome Townes vpon the <hi>Euxin</hi> ſea, that
before perteined to the <hi>Chrim Tartar.</hi>
Fourthly, becauſe <hi>Ortogules</hi> ſonne to <hi>Ogu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalpes,</hi>
&amp; (father to <hi>Otoman</hi> the firſt of name
of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> nation) made his firſt roads
out of thoſe partes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> vpon the next
borderers, till he came towardes the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
about the hill <hi>Taurus,</hi> where hee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the <hi>Greeks</hi> that inhabited there: and ſo
enlarged the name and territorie of the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> nation, til he came to <hi>Eubaa</hi> and <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica,</hi>
and other partes of <hi>Greece.</hi> This is the
opinion of <hi>Laonicus,</hi> who liued among the
<hi>Turks</hi> in the time of <hi>Amurat</hi> the ſixt <hi>Turkiſh</hi>
Emperour, about the yeere 1400. when the
memorie of their originall was more freſh:
and therefore the likelier hee was to hit the

            <p>There are diuers other <hi>Tartars</hi> that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the <hi>Nagay,</hi> are of two ſorts, the <hi>Lugauoy</hi> (that
is of the valley) and the <hi>Nagornay,</hi> or of the
hillie countrey. Theſe haue much troubled
the Emperours of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> And therfore they
are content now to buy peace of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnder
pretence of giuing a yeerely penſion of <hi>Ruſſe</hi>
commodities, to their <hi>Morſeis,</hi> or <hi>Diuoymor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeis,</hi>

vnder certeine conditions. They are ſaide to
be iuſt &amp; true in their dealings: and for that
cauſe they hate the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> people, whom they
account to be double, &amp; falſe in all their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
And therfore the common ſort are very
vnwilling to keep agreement with them, but
that they are kept in by their <hi>Morſeis,</hi> or

            <p>The moſt rude &amp; barbarous is cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the

This hee doeth (as the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> ſayeth) that
his friend may haue a good horſe to carie

are, <hi>Derbent</hi> (built by <hi>Alexander</hi> the great,
as the inhabitauntes ſaye) and <hi>Zamachie</hi>
where the ſtaple is kept for rawe ſilkes.
Their manner is in the Spring time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue
the ſilke-wormes (that lye dead all the
Winter) by laying them in the warme

The opinion is that they were firſt termed

thither, and to acknowledge a ſpirituall

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2440:82"/>
and to that Church. Which cuſtome they
haue held (as it ſeemeth) euer ſince they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed

(that I could heare of) to ſhewe what
hath bene done in times paſt within their
countrie concerning either Church, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth matters. Onely I heare a report
among them, that about three hundred
yeares ſince, there was a marriage betwixt
the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> &amp; the kings
daughter of that countrie: who at the firſt
denied to ioyne his daughter in marriage
with the <hi>Greeke</hi> Emperour, becauſe he was of
the Chriſtian religion. Which agreeth well
with that I finde in the ſtorie of <hi>Laonicus
Chalcacondylas</hi> concerning Turkiſh affaires
in his fourth booke: where hee ſpeaketh of
ſuch a marriage betwixt <hi>Iohn</hi> the Greeke
Emperour, and the Kings daughter of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia.</hi>
And this argueth out of their owne
report, that at that time they had not recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Chriſtian religion: as alſo that they
were conuerted to the faith, and withall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
at the very ſame time, receyuing the
doctrine of the goſpell, corrupted with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions
euen at the firſt when they tooke it
from the <hi>Greeke</hi> Church, which it ſelfe then
was degenerate, and corrupted with many
<pb facs="tcp:2440:83"/>
ſuperſtitions, and fowle errours, both in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and diſcipline: as may appeare by the
ſtory of <hi>Nicephorus Gregoras,</hi> in his 8. and 9.
bookes. But as touching the time of their
conuerſion to the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, I ſuppoſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that it is miſtaken by the <hi>Ruſſe,</hi> for that
which I find in the <hi>Polonian</hi> ſtorie, the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
booke the third chapter: where is ſaid that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

Wherupon the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> receiued the
faith &amp; profeſsion of Chriſt. Which though
it be ſomewhat more auncient then the time
noted before out of the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> report, yet it
falleth out al to one reckoning, touching this
point, vz: in what truth and ſinceritie of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> receiued the firſt ſtampe of
religion: for aſmuch as the <hi>Greeke</hi> church at

gaue him great intertainment. Before his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2440:83"/>
His arra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſult with the Emp.
concerning theſe points. Firſt about a league
to paſſe betwixt him &amp; the king of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as
the meeteſt Prince to ioyne with him in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
againſt the <hi>Turke.</hi> To which purpoſe
alſo Ambaſſages had paſſed betwixt the
<hi>Ruſſe</hi> &amp; the <hi>Perſian.</hi> Likewiſe from the <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi>
to the Emperour of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> to ioyne
league together, for the inuading of the
<hi>Turke</hi> on all ſides of his dominion: taking
the aduantage of the ſimple qualitie of the
<hi>Turke</hi> that now is. This treatie was helped
forward by the Emperours Ambaſſadour of
Almaine, ſent at the ſame time to ſolicite an
inuaſion vpon the parts of <hi>Polonia,</hi> that lie
towards <hi>Ruſland,</hi> and to borrow mony of the
<hi>Ruſſe</hi> Emperour, to purſue the warre for his
brother <hi>Maximilian,</hi> againſt the <hi>Swedens</hi> ſon
now king of <hi>Poland.</hi> But this conſultation
concerning a league betwixt the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> &amp; the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> (which was in ſome forwardnes at
my comming to <hi>Mosko,</hi> and already one ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for Ambaſſage into <hi>Spaine</hi>) was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by means of the ouerthrow giuen to the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> king by her Maieſtie, the Queene of
England, this laſt yeare. Which made the
<hi>Ruſſe</hi> Emperour and his Counſell, to giue a
ſadder countenance to the Engliſh Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
at that time: for that they were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
of ſo good a policie, as was this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
<pb facs="tcp:2440:84"/>
ſuppoſed to bee betwixt them and
the <hi>Spaniſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His ſecond purpoſe (whereto the firſt
ſerued as an introduction) was in reuenge
of the Turke and the Greeke cleargie, that
had thruſt him from his ſeat, to treate with
them about the reducing of the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> church
vnder the Pope of Rome. Wherein it may
ſeeme that comming lately from Rome, he
was ſet on by the Pope, who hath attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ſame many times before, though all
in vaine: and namely in the time of the late
Emperour <hi>Iuan Vaſilowich,</hi> by one <hi>Anthony</hi>
his Legate. But thought this belike a farre
better meane to obteine his purpoſe by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and mediation of their owne Patriarch.
But this not ſucceeding, the Patriarch fell to
a third point of treatie, concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
of his Patriarchſhip, &amp; tranſlation
of the Sea from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or <hi>Sio,</hi> to the
citie of <hi>Mosko.</hi> Which was ſo well liked, and
intertained by the Emperour (as a matter of
high religion, &amp; pollicie) that no other trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
(ſpecially of forrein Ambaſſages) could
be heard, or regarded, till that matter was
concluded.</p>
            <p>The reaſon wherewith the Patriarch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
the tranſlating of his Sea to the citie
of <hi>Mosko,</hi> were theſe in effect. Firſt, for that
the Sea of the Patriarch was vnder the <hi>Turk</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:2440:84"/>
that is enemie to the faith. And therefore to
bee remoued into ſome other countrie of
Chriſtian profeſsion. Secondly, becauſe the
<hi>Ruſſe</hi> church was the only naturall daughter
of the Greeke at this time, and holdeth the
ſame doctrine &amp; ceremonies with it the reſt
being all ſubiect to the Turke, and fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the right profeſsion. Wherein the
ſubtill Greeke to make the better market of
his broken ware, aduaunced the honour
that would growe to the Emperour, and his

into the chief citie, and ſeat of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
As for the right of tranſlating the ſea,
and appointing his ſucceſſour, hee made no
doubt of it, but that it perteyned wholy to
himſelfe.</p>
            <p>So the Emperour, &amp; his Counſell,<note place="margin">The Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archſhip of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko.</hi>
               </note> with the
principall of his cleargie being aſſembled at
the <hi>Mosko,</hi> it was determined that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolite</hi>
of <hi>Mosko,</hi> ſhould become Patriarch
of the whole Greeke Church, and haue the
ſamefull authoritie, &amp; iuriſdiction that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
before to the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
or <hi>Sio.</hi> And that it might bee done with
more order, &amp; ſolemnitie, the 25. of <hi>Ianuary,
1588.</hi> the Greeke Patriarch acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with
the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> Cleargie, went to the great Church
of <hi>Precheſte,</hi> or our Ladie, within the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
caſtle (hauing firſt wandred thorough
<pb facs="tcp:2440:85"/>
the whole citie in manner of a proceſsion,
and bleſsing the people with his two fingers)
where hee made an Oration, and deliuered
his reſignation in an inſtrument of writing,
and ſo laied downe his Patriarchicall ſtaffe.
Which was preſently receiued by the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polite
of <hi>Mosko,</hi> and diuers other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
vſed about the inauguration of this new
Patriarch.</p>
            <p>The day was holden very ſolemne by the
people of the citie, who were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to
forbeare their workes, and to attend this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie.
The great Patriarch that day was
honoured with rich preſents ſent him from
the Emperour and Empreſſe, of plate, cloth
of gold, furres, &amp;c: carried with great pompe
thorough the ſtreats of <hi>Mosko</hi> and at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
receiued many giftes more, both
from the Emperour, Nobilitie, and Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.
Thus the Patriarchſhip of <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
or <hi>Sio,</hi> (which hath continued ſince the
Counſell of <hi>Nice</hi>) is now tranſlated to <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko,</hi>
or they made beleeue that they haue a
Patriarch with the ſame right and authoritie
that the other had. Wherin the ſubtil <hi>Greeke</hi>
hath made good aduantage of their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
and is now gone away with a rich
bootie into <hi>Poland,</hi> whither their Patriarch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
be currant or not.</p>
            <p>The matter is not vnlike to make ſome
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2440:85"/>
ſchiſme betwixt the <hi>Greeke</hi> &amp; <hi>Ruſſe</hi> Church,
if the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> holde this Patriarchſhip that he
hath ſo well payed for, and the Greekes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
an other withall, as likely they will, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this man were baniſhed by the Turke,
or depriued by order of his owne Cleargie.
Which might happen to giue aduantage to
the Pope, &amp; to bring ouer the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> Church
to the ſea of Rome (to which end peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he deuiſed this ſtratageam, and caſt in
this matter of ſchiſme among them) but that
the Emperours of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> know well enough,
by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of other chriſtian Princes, what
inconuenience would grow to their ſtate &amp;
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, by ſubiecting themſelues to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
ſea. To which ende the late Emperour
<hi>Iuan Vaſilowich</hi> was very inquiſitiue of the
Popes authority ouer the Princes of chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
&amp; ſent one of very purpoſe to Rome,
to behold the order, &amp; behauior of his court.</p>
            <p>With this Patriarch <hi>Hieronimo</hi> was driuen
out at the ſame time by the great Turke, one
<hi>Demetrio</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Lariſſa:</hi> who is now
in England, &amp; pretendeth the ſame cauſe of
their baniſhment by the Turke (to wit) their
not admitting of the Popes new Kalender,
for the alteration of the yeare. Which how
vnlikely it is, may appeare by theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
Firſt, becauſe there is no ſuch affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
nor friendlie reſpect betwixt the
<pb facs="tcp:2440:86"/>
Pope &amp; the Turke, as that he ſhould baniſh a
ſubiect for not obeying the Popes ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
ſpecially in a matter of ſome ſequele for the
alteration of times within his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
Secondly, for that he maketh no ſuch
ſcruple in deducting of times, and keeping
of a iuſt and preciſe account from the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of Chriſt: whom he doth not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
otherwiſe then I noted before Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for that the ſaid Patriarch is now at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> where it may be gheſſed he would
not haue gone within the Popes reach, and
ſo neare to his noſe, if he had bene baniſhed

ſtate to their Church, and newe Patriarch,

office is to receiue of the Patriarch ſuch Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
orders, as he thinketh good, and
to deliuer the charge of them ouer to the
Archbiſhops: beſides the ordering of their
owne dioceſſe.</p>
            <p>Their Archbiſhops are foure: of <hi>Smolenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ko,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</note>
               <hi>Cazon, Vobsko,</hi> and <hi>Vologda.</hi> The partes of

their authoritie ouer the Cleargie, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
ſuch matters as are meare Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall,

cauſes, matters of marriage,

<pb facs="tcp:2440:87"/>
&amp;c. To which purpoſe alſo they haue
their Officials, or Commiſſaries (which
they call <hi>Boiaren Vladitskey</hi>) that are Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the degree of Dukes,<note place="margin">Their Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

oppreſsions ouer the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
raigne ouer the Prieſtes: as the Dukes
&amp; Diacks doo ouer the poore people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their precincts. As for the Archbiſhop or

thoſe cauſes, that are brought into

matter, hee muſt doo it by intreatie with
his Gentleman officiall. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
theſe <hi>Boiarskey,</hi> or Gentlemen offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
are not appointed by the Biſhops, but
by the Emperour himſelfe, or his Counſell,
and are to giue account of their doings to
none but to them. If the Biſhoppe can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
at his admiſsion to haue the choice of
his owne officiall, it is accounted for a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
great fauour. But to ſpeake it as it is,
the Cleargie of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> aſwell concerning
their landes and reuenues, as their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and iuriſdiction, are altogether ordered
and ouer ruled by the Emperour, and his
Counſell, and haue ſo much, and no more of
both as their pleaſure doth permit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They

            <p>Concerning their rentes and reuenues
to mainteyne their dignities,<note place="margin">The church reuenues.</note> it is ſomewhat
large. The Patriarches yearely rents out of

rubbels, or markes. The Metropolites and

a 1000. ſome 800. ſome 500, &amp;c. They haue
had ſome of them (as I haue heard ſay) ten
or twelue thouſand rubbels a yeare: as had
the Metropolite of <hi>Nouograde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their habite or apparell (when they
ſhewe themſelues in their Pontificalibus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

their heades,<note place="margin">The habite of their clergy men.</note> after the popiſh faſhion, ſette
with pearle and pretious ſtone, a cope on

embrodered with pearle, and a Croſiers
ſtaffe in their handes, layed ouer all with
plate of ſiluer double guilt, with a croſſe
or ſheepheardes crooke at the vpper ende
of it. Their ordinarie habite othewiſe
when they ride or goe abroad, is a hood on
their heads of blacke colour, that hangeth
downe their backes, and ſtandeth out like a

(which they call <hi>Reis</hi>) is a gowne or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
of blacke Damaske, with many liſtes or
gardes of white Sattin layed vpon it, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

followe after, bleſsing the people

            <p>The election,<note place="margin">The electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Biſhops.</note> and appointing of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops

Emperour himſelfe. They are choſen euer
out of the Monaſteries: ſo that there is no
Biſhop, Archbiſhop, nor Metropolite, but
hath bene a Monke, or Frier before. And
by that reaſon they are, and muſt all bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maried
men, for their vow of chaſtitie when
they were firſt ſhorne. When the Emperour
hath appointed whom hee thinketh good,
he is inueſted in the Cathedrall church of
his dioces, with many ceremonies, much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the manner of the Popiſh inauguration.
They haue alſo their Deanes, &amp; their Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons.</p>
            <p>As for preaching the worde of God,<note place="margin">The lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> Clergie.</note>
or any teaching, or exhorting ſuch as are

skill of it: the whole Cleargie beyng
vtterlie vnlearned bothe for other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and in the word of God. Onely their
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2440:88"/>
manner is twiſe euery yeere, vz. the firſt of
September (which is the firſt day of their
yere) and on S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſts day, to make an
ordinarie ſpeach to the people, euery Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolite,
Archbiſhop, and Biſhop in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall
Church, to this or like effect: That
if anie be in malice towardes his neighbour,
hee ſhall leaue off his malice: if any haue
thought of treaſon or rebellion againſt his
Prince, he beware of ſuch practiſe: if he haue
not kept his faſts, and vowes, nor done his
other dueties to the holie Church, he ſhal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
that fault, &amp;c. And this is a matter of
forme with them, vttered in as many words,
and no more, in a manner, then I haue heere
ſet downe. Yet the matter is done with that
grace and ſolemnitie, in a pulpit of purpoſe
ſet vp for this one Acte, as if he were to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
at large of the whole ſubſtance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie.
At the <hi>Mosko</hi> the Emperour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
is euer preſent at this ſolemne exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>As themſelues are voyde of all maner of
learning, ſo are they warie to keepe out all
meanes that might bring any in: as fearing
to haue their ignorance, and vngodlineſſe
diſcouered. To that purpoſe they haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
the Emperours, that it would breed
innouation, and ſo danger to their ſtate, to
haue anie noueltie of learning come within
<pb facs="tcp:2440:89"/>
the Realme. Wherein they ſay but trueth, for
that a man of ſpirit and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, helped
by learning and liberal education, can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
indure a tyrannicall gouernment. Some
yeres paſt in the other Emperors time, there
came a Preſſe and Letters out of <hi>Polonia,</hi> to
the citie of <hi>Mosko,</hi> where a printing houſe
was ſet vp, with great liking &amp; allowance of
the Emperour himſelfe. But not long after,
the houſe was ſet on fire in the night time,
and the preſſe and letters quite burnt vp, as
was thought by the procurement of the
Cleargy men.</p>
            <p>Their Prieſtes (whom they call <hi>Papaes</hi> are
made by the Biſhops,<note place="margin">Prieſts.</note> without any great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
for worthineſſe of giftes, before they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them, or ceremonies in their admiſsion:
ſaue that their heades are ſhorne (not ſhauen
for that they like not) about an hand bredth
or more in the crowne, and that place an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted
with oyle by the Biſhop: who in
his admiſsion putteth vpon the prieſt, firſt
his ſurpleſſe, and then ſetteth a white croſſe
on his breſt of ſilke, or ſome other matter,
which he is to weare eight dayes, and no
more: and ſo giueth him authoritie to ſay
and ſing in the Church, and to adminiſter
the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>They are men vtterly vnlearned, which is
no marueile, foraſmuch as their makers, the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2440:89"/>
Biſhops themſelues (as before was ſaide) are
cleere of that qualitie, and make no farther
vſe at al of any kind of learning, no not of the
ſcriptures themſelues, ſaue to reade and to
ſing them. Their ordinary charge &amp; functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is to ſay the Leiturgie, to adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
after their maner, to keepe &amp; deck
their idoles, and to doe the other ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
vſuall in their Churches. Their number
is great becauſe their townes are parted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
many ſmal pariſhes, without any deſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for deuiding them into competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of houſholds, and people for a iuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation:
as the manner in all places where
the meanes is neglected, for increaſing of
knowledge, and inſtruction towardes God.
Which cannot well be had, where by means
of an vnequall partition of the people, and
pariſhes, there followeth a want and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equalitie
of ſtipend for a ſufficient mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.</p>
            <p>For their prieſts,<note place="margin">The <hi>Ruſſe</hi> Prieſts can marry but once.</note> it is lawful to marrie for
the firſt time. But if the firſt wife dye, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
hee cannot take, but hee muſt looſe
his Prieſthood, and his liuing withall. The
reaſon they make out of that place of Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie</hi> 1. 3. 2. not well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
thinking that to bee ſpoken of diuers
wiues ſucceſsiuely, that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh
of at one and the ſame time. If he will needs
<pb facs="tcp:2440:90"/>
marry againe after his firſt wife is dead, hee
is no longer called <hi>Papa,</hi> but <hi>Roſpapa,</hi> or
<hi>Prieſt quondam.</hi> This maketh the Prieſtes to
make much of their wiues, who are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as the matrones, and of beſt reputation
among the women of the pariſh.</p>
            <p>For the ſtipend of the Prieſt, their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is not to pay him any tenthes of corne,
or ought els: but he muſt ſtand at the deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the people of his pariſh, and make vp
the incommes towards his maintenance, ſo
wel as he can, by offerings, ſhriftes, marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
burials, dirges, and prayers for the dead
and the liuing. (which they call <hi>Molitua</hi>)
Forbeſides their publike ſeruice within their
Churches, their manner is for euery priuate
man to haue a prayer ſaide for him by the
Prieſt, vpon any occaſion of buſineſſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer,
whether he ride, goe, ſaile, plough,
or whatſoeuer els he doeth. Which is not
framed according to the occaſion of his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe,
but at randome, being ſome of their
ordinarie and vſuall Church-prayers. And
this is thought to be more holy, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
if it be repeated by the Prieſts mouth, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then by his owne. They haue a cuſtome
beſides to ſolemnize the Saints day, that is
patrone to their Church once euery yeere.
What time al their neighbours of their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and pariſhes about, come in to haue
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2440:90"/>
prayers ſaide to that Saint for themſelues,
and their friendes: and ſo make an offering
to the Prieſt for his paines. This offering
may yeeld them ſome ten poundes a yeere,
more or leſſe, as the patrone, or Saint of
that Church is of credite, and eſtimation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. The manner is on this day
(which they keep anniuerſarie) for the prieſt,
to hire diuers of his neighbour prieſtes to
helpe him: as hauing more diſhes to dreſſe
for the Saint, then he can wel turne his hand
vnto. They vſe beſides to viſite their pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
houſes, with holy water, and perfume,
commonly once a quarter: and ſo hauing
ſprinckled, and beſenſed the goodman and
his wife with the reſt of their houſhold, and
houſhold-ſtuffe, they receiue ſome deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
more or leſſe,<note place="margin">The prieſts mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> as the man is of abilitie. This
and the reſt laid altogether, may make vp
for the prieſt towardes his maintenaunce, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thirtie or fourtie rubbels a yere: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he payeth the tenth part to the Biſhop of
the Dioces.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papa</hi> or Prieſt is knowen by his long
tufts of haire,<note place="margin">The prieſts attire.</note> hanging downe by his eares,
his gowne with a broad cape, and a walking
ſtaffe in his hand. For the reſt of his habite,
he is apparelled like the common ſort. When
he ſaith the Leiturgie or ſeruice, within the
Church, he hath on him his ſurpleſſe, and
<pb facs="tcp:2440:91"/>
ſometimes his coape, if the day be more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne.
They haue beſides their <hi>Papaes</hi> or
Prieſtes, their <hi>Churnapapaes</hi> (as they call
them) that is; <hi>Blacke Priestes:</hi> that may
keepe their Benefices, though they bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
Friers withall within ſome Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.
They ſeeme to bee the verie ſame
that were called Regular Prieſtes in the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Church. Vnder the Prieſt, is a Deacon
in euery Church, that doeth nothing but the
office of a pariſh Clearke. As for their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>topapaes,</hi>
or Archeprieſtes, and their Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons
(that are next in election to be their
<hi>Protopopas</hi>) they ſerue onely in the cathedral
Churches.</p>
            <p>Of Friers they haue an infinit rabble farre
greater the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any other countrey,<note place="margin">Friers.</note> where po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
is profeſſed. Euery city, &amp; good part of
the countrey, ſwarmeth ful of them. For they
haue wrought (as the popiſh Friers did by
their ſuperſtition and hypocriſie) that if any
part of the Realme bee better and ſweeter

dedicated to ſome Saint.</p>
            <p>The number of them is ſomuch the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
not onely for that it is augmented by
the ſuperſtition of the countrey, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Fryers life is the ſafeſt from the
oppreſsions, and exactions, that fall vpon
the Commons. Which cauſeth many to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2440:91"/>
put on the Fryers weede, as the beſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
to beare off ſuch blowes. Beſides ſuch
as are voluntarie, there are diuers that are
forced to ſhire themſelues Fryers, vpon
ſome diſpleaſure. Theſe are for the moſt part
of the chiefe Nobility. Diuers take the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries
as a place of Sanctuary, and there
become Friers, to auoyde ſome puniſhment,
that they had deſerued by the lawes of the
Realme. For if hee gette a Monaſtery ouer
his head, and there put on a coole before
hee be attached, it is a protection to him
for euer againſt any law, for what crime ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
except it be for treaſon. But this <hi>Prouiſo</hi>
goeth withal, that no man commeth there,
(except ſuch as are commanded by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
to be receiued) but hee giueth them
lands, or bringeth his ſtock with him, &amp; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
it into the common Treaſurie. Some
bring a 1000 rubbels, &amp; ſome more. None is
admitted vnder 3. or 4. hundred.</p>
            <p>The manner of their admiſsion is after
this ſort.<note place="margin">Their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Friers.</note> Firſt, the Abbot ſtrippeth him of
all his ſecular or ordinarie apparell. Then
hee putteth vpon him next to his skinne, a
white flannel ſhirt, with a long garment o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
it down to the ground, girded vnto him
with a broade leather belt. His vppermoſt
garment is a weede of <hi>Garras,</hi> or <hi>Say,</hi> for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and faſhion, much like to the vpper
<pb facs="tcp:2440:92"/>
weed of a Chimney-ſweeper. Then is his
crown ſhorne a hand breadth, or more cloſe
to the very skinne, and theſe, or like wordes
pronounced by the Abbot, whiles hee clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
his haire: <hi>As theſe haires are clipped of, &amp;
taken from thy head: ſo now we take thee, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
thee cleane from the worlde, and worldly
thinges, &amp;c.</hi> This done, hee annoynteth his
crowne with oyle, and putteth on his coole:
and ſo taketh him in among the Fraternitie.
They vowe perpetuall chaſtitie, and abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from fleſh.</p>
            <p>Beſides their landes, (that are verie great)
they are the greateſt marchants in the whole
countrey, and deale for all manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.
Some of their monaſteries diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
in landes, one thouſande, or two thouſande
rubbels a yeere. There is one Abbey called
<hi>Troits,</hi> that hath in lands &amp; fees, the ſumme
of 100000. rubbels, or marks a yeere. It is
built in maner of a Caſtle, walled rounde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
with great ordinance planted on the
wall, and conteineth within it a large bredth
of grounde, and great varietie of building.
There are of Friers within it, (beſides their
officers, and other ſeruants) about 700. The
Empreſſe that now is, hath many vowes to
<hi>Saint Sergius,</hi> that is patrone there: to intreat
him to make her fruitful, as hauing no chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by the Emperour her huſband. Lightly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2440:92"/>
euery yeere ſhe goeth on pilgrimage to him
from the <hi>Mosko,</hi> on foote, about 80 Engliſh
miles, with fiue or ſixe thouſand women at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
vpon her, all in blewe liueries, and
foure thouſand ſouldiers for her garde. But
<hi>Saint Sergius</hi> hath not yet heard her prayers,
though (they ſay) he hath a ſpeciall gift and
facultie that way.</p>
            <p>What learning there is among their Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">The Friers learning.</note>
may be knowen by their Biſhops, that
are the choyce men out of all their monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
I talked with one of them at the Citie
of <hi>Vologda,</hi> where (to trie his skill) I offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him a <hi>Ruſſe</hi> Teſtament, and turned him
to the firſt Chapter of Saint <hi>Mathewes</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.
Where hee beganne to reade in verie
good order. I asked him firſt what part of
ſcripture it was, that hee had read? hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that hee coulde not well tell. Howe
manie Euangeliſtes there were in the newe
Teſtament? Hee ſayde he knew not. Howe
manie Apoſtles there were? Hee thought
there were twelue. Howe he ſhoulde be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued?
Whereunto he anſweared mee with a
piece of <hi>Ruſſe</hi> doctrine, that hee knew not
whether he ſhoulde bee ſaued, or no: but if
God woulde <hi>Poſhallouate</hi> him, or gratifie
him ſo much, as to ſaue him, ſo it was, hee
would be glad of it: if not, what remedie.
I asked him, why he ſhoare himſelfe a Fryer?
<pb facs="tcp:2440:93"/>
He anſwered, becauſe he would eat his bread
with peace. This is the learning of the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> which though it be not to bee
meaſured by one, yet partly it may bee geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the ignorance of this man, what is in
the reſt.</p>
            <p>They haue alſo many Nunneries,<note place="margin">Nunneries.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſome may admitte none but Noblemens
widowes, and daughters, when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
meaneth to keepe them vnmarried,
from continuing the blood or ſtocke, which
he would haue extinguiſhed. To ſpeak of the
life of their Friers, and Nunnes, it needes not,
to thoſe that know the hypocriſie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe
of that Cloyſter-broode. The
<hi>Ruſſe</hi> himſelfe (though otherwiſe addicted
to all ſuperſtition) ſpeaketh ſo fowlly of it,
that it muſt needes gaine ſilence of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
man.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe,<note place="margin">Eremites.</note> they haue certeyne <hi>Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi>
(whome they call <hi>Holy men</hi>) that are
like to thoſe <hi>Gymnoſophiſts,</hi> for their life and
behauiour: though farre vnlike for their
knowledge, &amp; learning. They vſe to go ſtarke
naked, ſaue a clout about their middle, with
their haire hanging long, and wildely about
their ſhoulders, and many of them with an
iron coller, or chaine about their neckes, or
middes, euen in the very extremity of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Theſe they take as Prophets, and men of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2440:93"/>
great holines, giuing them a liberty to ſpeak
what they liſt, without any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troulme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, thogh
it be of thee very higheſt himſelfe. So that if
he reproue any openly, in what ſort ſoeuer,
they anſwere nothing, but that it is <hi>Po gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi>
that is, for their ſinnes. And if anie of
them take ſome piece of ſale ware from anie
mans ſhop, as he paſſeth by, to giue where he
liſt, hee thinketh himſelfe much beloued of
God, and much beholding to the holy man,
for taking it in that ſort.</p>
            <p>Of this kinde there are not many, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is a very harde and colde profeſsion,
to goe naked in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> ſpecially in Winter.
Among other at this time, they haue one
at <hi>Mosko,</hi> that walketh naked about the
ſtreetes, and inueyeth commonly againſt
the ſtate, and gouernment, eſpecially againſt
the <hi>Godonoes,</hi> that are thought at this time
to bee great oppreſſours of that Common
wealth. An other there was, that dyed not
many yeeres agoe (whome they called <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leo</hi>)
that would take vpon him to reprooue
the olde Emperour,<note place="margin">Baſileo <hi>the</hi> Eremite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> for all his crueltie, and
oppreſsions, done towards his people. His
body they haue tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated of late into a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Church, neere the Emperours houſe in
<hi>Mosko,</hi> and haue canonized him for a Saint.
Many miracles he doth there (for ſo the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
make the people to beleeue) and manie
<pb facs="tcp:2440:94"/>
offrings are made vnto him, not only by the
people, but by the chiefe Nobilitie, and the
Emperour, and Empreſſe themſelues, which
viſite that Church with great deuotion. But
this laſt yeere, at my beeing at <hi>Mosko,</hi> this
Saint had ill lucke, in working his miracles.
For a lame man that had his limmes reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
(as it was pretended by him) was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by a woman that was familiar with him
(being then fallen out) that hee halted but
in the day time, and coulde leape merily
when he came home at night. And that hee
had intended this matter ſixe yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Nowe he is put into a Monaſtery, and
there rayleth vpon the Fryers, that hyred
him to haue this counterfaite miracle, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
vpon him. Beſides this diſgrace, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before my comming from thence, there
were eyght ſlaine within his Church by fire
in a thunder. Which cauſed his belles (that
were tingling before all day and night long
as in triumph of the miracles wrought by
<hi>Baſileo</hi> their Saint) to ring ſomewhat ſoftli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and hath wrought no little diſcredite to
this Miracle-worker. There was another of
great account at <hi>Plesko,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nicôla <hi>the</hi> Eremite.</note> (called <hi>Nichôla</hi> of
<hi>Plesko</hi>) that did much good, when this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
father came to ſack the towne, vpon
ſuſpition of their reuolting and rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. The Emperour, after hee had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2440:94"/>
the <hi>Eremite,</hi> at his lodging, ſent him a
reward. And the <hi>Holy man</hi> to requite the
Emperour, ſent him a piece of rawe fleſhe,
beyng then their Lent time. Which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
ſeeing, bid one to tell him, that hee
marueiled that the <hi>Holy man</hi> woulde offer
him fleſh to eat in the Lent, when it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
by order of holie Church. And doth
<hi>Euasko,</hi> (which is as much to ſaye, as Iacke)
thinke (quoth <hi>Nicôla</hi>) that it is vnlawfull to
eate a piece of beaſts fleſh in Lent, and not to
eate vp ſo much mans fleſh, as hee hath done
already. So threatning the Emperour with
a prophecy of ſome hard aduenture to come
vpon him, except hee left murdering of his
people, and departed the towne: he ſaued a
great many mens liues at that time.</p>
            <p>This maketh the people to like very well
of them, becauſe they are as <hi>Paſquils,</hi> to note
their great mens faults, that no man els dare
ſpeake of. Yet it falleth out ſometime, that
for this rude libertie, which they take vpon
them, after a counterfeite maner, by imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Prophets, they are made away in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret:
as was one or two of them, in the

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:2440:95"/>
or <hi>Lord haue mercie vpon vs, Lorde haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

ſome Saints life, miracles, &amp;c. This is diuided
into manie partes, for euerie day in the

ſinging note, not vnlike to the Popiſh tune,
when they ſoung their Goſpels. After all
this (which reacheth to an houre, and an
halfe, or two houres of length) hee addeth
certeyne ſette Collectes, or prayers vpon
that which hee hath read out of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend

<pb facs="tcp:2440:96"/>

            <p>About 9. of the clock in the morning, they

hauing ſaid a collect in remembrance of the

All this while the Prieſt ſtandeth aboue

though otherwiſe their office is to ſweepe,

for piew, or ſeate they haue none within

            <p>The Sacrament of baptiſme they admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
after this manner.<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</note> The child is brought

cuſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of cloth of gold, &amp; ſuch like ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

are come to the Church, the Prieſt ſtandeth
<pb facs="tcp:2440:97"/>
ready to receiue the child within the church
porch, with his tub of water by him. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
beginneth to declare vnto them, that they
haue brought a little Infidell to be made a
Chriſtian, &amp;c. This ended, he teacheth the
witneſſes (that are two or three) in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
ſet forme out of his booke, what their
dutie is in bringing vp the childe after hee is
baptiſed vz. That he muſt be taught to know
God, and Chriſt the Sauiour. And becauſe
God is of great maieſtie, and wee muſt not
preſume to come vnto him without media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
(as the manner is when wee make any
ſuit to an Emperour, or great Prince) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they muſt teach him what Saints are
the beſt, &amp; chiefe mediatours, &amp;c. This done,
he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth the diuell in the name of God
after a coniuring manner, to come out of the
water: &amp; ſo after certeine praiers he plungeth
the childe thriſe ouer head, &amp; eares. For this
they holde to be a point neceſſary, that no
part of the childe be vndipped in the water.</p>
            <p>The words that beare with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forme
of baptiſme vttered by the Prieſt, when he
dippeth in the childe, are the very ſame that
are preſcribed in the goſpell, &amp; vſed by vs,
vz: <hi>In the name of the Father, &amp; of the Sonne, &amp;
of the Ghoſt.</hi> For that they ſhould altar the
forme of the words, and ſay <hi>by the holy Ghoſt,</hi>
(as I haue heard that they did (folowing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2440:97"/>
heretikes of the Greeke church, I found
to be vntrue, aſwell by report of them that
haue bin often at their baptiſmes, as by their
booke of <hi>Leiturgie</hi> it ſelfe, wherein the order
of baptiſme is preciſely ſet downe.</p>
            <p>When the childe is baptiſzed, the Prieſt
laieth oile and ſalt tempred together vpon
the forehead, and both ſides of his face, and
then vppon his mouth, drawing it along
with his finger ouer the childes lippes (as
did the Popiſh prieſtes) ſaying withall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
prayers to this effect: that God will
make him a good Chriſtian, &amp;c: all this is
done in the Church porch. Then is the
childe (as being now made a Chriſtian, and
meet to be receiued within the church dore)
carried into the church, the Prieſt going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and there he is preſented to the chiefe
Idoll of the Church, being layd on a cuſhion
before the feete of the image, by it (as by the
mediatour) to bee commended vnto God.
If the child be fick, or weake (ſpecially in the
winter) they vſe to make the water luke
warme. After baptiſme the manner is to cut
of the haire from the childes head, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
wrapped it within a piece of wax to lay
it vp, as a relique, or monument in a ſecret
place of the church.</p>
            <p>This is the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of their baptiſme, which
they accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be the beſt &amp; perfecteſt form.
<pb facs="tcp:2440:98"/>
As they doo all other parts of their religion,
receiued (as they ſay) by tradition from the
beſt church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> meaning the Greeke. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they will take great paynes to make a
proſelite, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uert, either of an infidell, or of
a forrein Chriſtian, by rebaptizing him after
the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> manner. When they take any <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>
priſoner, commonly they will offer him
life, with condition to be baptized. And yet
they perſwade very few of them to redeeme
their life ſo: becauſe of the naturall hatred
the <hi>Tartar</hi> beareth to the <hi>Ruſſe,</hi> and the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
he hath of his falſhood, and iniuſtice.
The yere after <hi>Mosko</hi> was fired by the <hi>Chrim

Of Engliſhmen ſince they frequented the
countrie there was neuer any found, that ſo
much forgot God, his faith, and countrie, as
that he would bee content to be baptized
<hi>Ruſſe,</hi> for any reſpect of feare, preferment,
or other meanes whatſoeuer: ſaue onely <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard

            <p>Such as thus receiue the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> baptiſme,
are firſt carried into ſome Monaſterie to be
inſtructed there in the doctrine and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

Firſt, they put him into a new and
freſh ſuite of apparell, made after the <hi>Ruſſe</hi>
faſhion, and ſet a coronet or (in Sommer) a
garland vpon his head. Then they annoint
his head with oile, &amp; put a waxe candle light
into his hand: and ſo pray ouer him foure
times a day, the ſpace of ſeuen daies. All this
while he is to abſtaine from fleſh and white
meats. The ſeuen daies being ended, he is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
and waſhed in a bathſtoue, and ſo the

where he is taught by the Friers how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
<pb facs="tcp:2440:99"/>
himſelfe in preſence of their idols, by
ducking downe, knocking of the head, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

            <p>The ſacrament of the Lordes ſupper they

The manner of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating, is thus.
Firſt they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe themſelues of all their ſins
to the Prieſt (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they call their ghoſtly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Then they come to the Church, &amp; are
called vp to the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion table, that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
like an altar, a little remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

Here firſt they are asked of the Prieſt
whither they be cleane or no, that is, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they haue neuer a ſinne behind that
they left vnconfeſſed. If they anſwere, <hi>No,</hi>
they are taken to the table. Where the Prieſt
beginneth with certeine vſuall prayers, the
communicants ſtanding in the meane while
with their armes foulded one within an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
like penitentiaries, or mourners. When
theſe prayers are ended, the Prieſt taketh a
ſpoone, and filleth it full of claret wine Then
he putteth into it a ſmall piece of bread, and
tempereth them both together: and ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth
them in the ſpoone to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants,
that ſtande in order, ſpeaking the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:2440:99"/>
vſuall wordes of the Sacrament. <hi>Eat this &amp;c.

            <p>After that he deliuereth them againe
bread by it ſelf, and then wine carded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a little warme water, to repreſent
bloud more rightly (as they thinke) and the
water withall, that flowed out of the ſide of
Chriſt. Whiles this is in doing the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants
vnfold their armes. And then foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
them againe, follow the Prieſt thriſe
round about the communion table, and ſo
returne to their places againe. Where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſaid certeine other prayers, he diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
the communicants, with charge to bee

bread and ſalt, except a little cabbage, and
ſome other hearbe or roote, with water or

            <p>This is their manner of adminiſtring the

Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Their diſallowing of certeine parts of the Canonicall ſcriptures.</note> concerning the word of
God it ſelf, they will not read
publiquely certeine bookes
of the Canonicall ſcripture,
as the bookes of <hi>Moſes:</hi> ſpecially the foure
laſt, <hi>Exodus, Leuiticus, Numeri,</hi> and <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie,</hi>
which they ſay are al made diſauthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,
and put out of vſe by the comming of
Chriſt: as not able to diſcerne the difference
betwixt the morall, and the ceremoniall law,
The bookes of the prophets they allow of,
but read the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not publikely in their churches
for the ſame reaſon: becauſe they were but
directers vnto Chriſt, &amp; proper (as they ſay)
to the nation of the Iewes. Onely the booke
of Pſalmes they haue in great eſtimation and
ſing and ſay them dayly in their Churches,
Of the new Teſtament they allow, and read
all except the <hi>Reuelation:</hi> which therefore
they read not (though they allow it becauſe
they vnderſtand it not, neither haue the like
occaſion, to know the fulfilling of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2440:100"/>
conteyned within it, concerning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
the apoſtaſie of the Antichriſtian
Church, as haue the Weſterne Churches.
Notwithſtanding they haue had their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts
of the Greeke Church, and may finde
their owne falling of, and the puniſhments
for it by the Turkiſh inuaſion in the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of that Booke.</p>
            <p>Secondly (which is the fountain of the reſt
of al their corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,<note place="margin">2. Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons equall to the holy Scripture.</note> both in doctrine &amp; ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies)
they holde with the Papiſtes, that
their church <hi>Traditions</hi> are of equall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with the written worde of God. Wherein
they prefer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues before other churches:
affirming that they haue the true and right
traditions deliuered by the Apoſtles to the
Greeke church, and ſo vnto them.</p>
            <p>3. That the church (meaning the Greeke
and ſpecially the Patriarch and his Synod,<note place="margin">3. The Church to haue ſoueraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Scriptures.</note> as
the head of the reſt) haue a ſoueraigne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
to interpret the Scriptures, and that
all are bound to holde that interpretation as

            <p>4. Concerning the diuine nature &amp; the

            <p>5. About the office of Chriſt,<note place="margin">5. Chriſt not ſole mediator of interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> they holde
many fowle errours, and the ſame almoſt as
doth the Popiſh church: namely that hee is
<pb facs="tcp:2440:101"/>
the ſole mediatour of redemption, but not of
interceſsion. Their chiefe reaſon (if they bee
talked withall) for defence of this errour, is
that vnapt and fooliſh compariſon, betwixt
God and a Monarch or Prince of this world,
that muſt bee ſued vnto by Mediatours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him: wherein they giue ſpeciall prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to ſome aboue others, as to the bleſſed
<hi>Virgin</hi> whom they call <hi>Precheſte,</hi> or vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and S. <hi>Nicôlas,</hi> whom they call <hi>Scora po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſnick,</hi>
or the <hi>Speedy helper,</hi> and ſay that he
hath 300. angels of the chiefeſt appointed by
God to attend vpon him. This hath brought
them to an horrible exceſſe of idolatry, after
the groſſeſt &amp; prophaneſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, giuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their images al religious worſhip of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
thankſgiuing, offerings, &amp; adoration, with
proſtrating and knocking their heads to the
ground before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as to God himſelf. Which
becauſe they doo to the picture, not to the
portraiture of the Saint, they ſay they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
not an idol, but the Saint in his image &amp;
ſo offend not God: forgetting the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, that forbiddeth to make the
image or likenes of any thing, for any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
worſhip, or vſe whatſoeuer. Their church
walles are very full of them, richly hanged &amp;
ſet forth with pearle &amp; ſtone vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſmooth
table. Though ſome alſo they haue emboſſed,
that ſtick from the board almoſt an inch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2440:101"/>
They call them <hi>Chudouodites,</hi> or their
miracle workers: and when they prouide
them to ſet vp in their Churches, in no caſe
they may ſay that they haue bought the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
but exchaunged monie for it.</p>
            <p>6. For the means of iuſtification,<note place="margin">6. Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by workes.</note> they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with the Papiſts, that it is not by faith
only apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding Chriſt, but by their works
alſo. And that <hi>Opus operatum,</hi> or the worke
for the worke ſake, muſt needes pleaſe God.
And therefore they are all in their numbers
of praiers, faſtes, vowes, &amp; offrings to ſaints,
almes deeds, croſsings &amp; ſuch like, and carrie
their numbring beads about with them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,
aſwel the Emperour &amp; his Nobilitie
as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people, not only in the church,
but in all other publike places, ſpecially at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſet or ſolemne meeting, as in their faſtes,
lawe courts, common conſultations, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement
of Ambaſſadours, and ſuch like.</p>
            <p>7. They ſay with the Papiſts that no man
can be aſſured of his ſaluation,<note place="margin">7. Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine.</note> til the laſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
be paſſed at the day of iudgement.</p>
            <p>8. They vſe auricular confeſsion,<note place="margin">8. Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> &amp; thinke
that they are purged by the very action fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſo many ſinnes, as they confeſſe by name, and
in particular to the Prieſt.</p>
            <p>9. They hold three ſacramentes, of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi>
               <note place="margin">9. Three Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</note>
the <hi>Lords ſupper,</hi> and <hi>the laſt annoiling,</hi>
or <hi>vnction.</hi> Yet concerning their Sacrament
<pb facs="tcp:2440:102"/>
of extreame vnction, they holde it not ſo
neceſſarie to ſaluation as they do baptiſme,
but thinke it a great curſe and puniſhment of
God,<note place="margin">10. All da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that die without baptiſme.</note> if any die with out it.</p>
            <p>10. They thinke there is a neceſsitie of
baptiſme, and that all are condemned that
die without it.<note place="margin">11. Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme.</note>
            </p>
            <p>11. They rebaptiſe as many Chriſtians
(not being of the Greek church) as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
to their <hi>Ruſſe</hi> profeſsion: becauſe they
are diuided from the true Church, which is
the Greeke,<note place="margin">12. Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of meates.</note> as they ſay.</p>
            <p>12. They make a difference of meates &amp;
drinks, accounting the vſe of one, to be more
holy then of an other. And therefore in their
ſet faſtes they forbeare to eate fleſhe, and
white meats (as we call them) after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Popiſh ſuperſtition: which they
obſerue ſo ſtrictly, &amp; with ſuch blinde deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as that they will rather die, then eat one
bit of fleſh, egges, or ſuch like, for the health
of their bodies in their extreme ſickneſe.</p>
            <p>13. They hold marriage to be vnlawfull
for all the Clergie men,<note place="margin">13. Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age for ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> except the prieſts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and for them alſo after the firſt wife, as
was ſaid before. Neither doo they well allow
of it in Lay men after the ſecond marriage.
Which is a pretence now vſed againſt the
Emperours only brother, a child of ſix yeres
old: Who therefore is not praiſed for in their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2440:102"/>
churches (as their manner is otherwiſe for
the Princes bloud) becauſe hee was borne of
the ſixt marriage, and ſo not legitimate This
charge was giuen to the prieſts by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
himſelfe, by procurement of the
<hi>Godonoes:</hi> who make him beleeue that it is a
good pollicie to turne away the liking of the
people from the next ſucceſſour.</p>
            <p>Many other falſe opinions they haue in
matter of religion. But theſe are the chiefe,
which they holde partly by meanes of their
traditions (which they haue receiued from
the Greeke church) but ſpecially by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the holy Scriptures. Which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
they haue in the <hi>Polonian</hi> tongue,
(that is all one with theirs ſome few wordes
excepted) yet fewe of them read them with
that godly care which they ought to doo:
neither haue they (if they would) bookes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
of the old and new Teſtament for the
common people, but of their Leiturgie one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or booke of common ſeruice, whereof
there are great numbers.</p>
            <p>All this miſchief commeth from the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
who being ignorant and godleſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
are very warie to keepe the people
likewiſe in their ignorance and blindneſſe,
for their liuing and bellies ſake: partly alſo
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the manner of gouernment ſetled among
them: which the Emperours (whom it ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb facs="tcp:2440:103"/>
behoueth) liſt not to haue chaunged by
any innouation, but to retaine that religion
that beſt agreeth with it. Which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it is not to be doubted, but that hauing
the word of God in ſome ſort (though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ordinarie meanes to attaine to a true
ſenſe and vnderſtanding of it) God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
his number among them. As may partly
appeare by that which a <hi>Ruſſe</hi> at <hi>Mosko</hi> ſaid
in ſecret to one of my ſeruaunts, ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their images and other ſuperſtitions:
That God had giuen vnto England light to
day, and might giue it to morrow (if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
to them.</p>
            <p>As for any inquiſition or proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
men for matter of religion, I could
heare of none: ſaue a few yeares ſince againſt
one man and his wife, who were kept in a
cloſe priſon the ſpace of 28. yeares, till they
were ouer growen into a deformed faſhion,
for their hayre, nailes, collour of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and ſuch like, and in the end were bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
at <hi>Mosko,</hi> in a ſmall houſe ſet on fire.
The cauſe was kepte ſecrete, but like it was
for ſome part of truth in matter of religion:
though the people were made to beleeue
by the Prieſts and Friers, that they
held ſome great, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

<pb facs="tcp:2440:104"/>
a courteſie more, at the diſcretion of the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
If the huſband depart without iſſue

On the eaue before the marriage

and is commonly very faire, with much coſt
beſtowed vpon it. Here ſhe is accompaned

<pb facs="tcp:2440:105"/>
firſt the father, and the other friends of
the Bride, and bowe themſelues downe low
to the Bridegroome: and ſo likewiſe his
friends bow themselues to the Bride, in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of affinity &amp; loue, euer after betwixt the two
kinreds. And withall, the father of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome
offreth to the prieſt, a loafe of bread,
who deliuereth it ſtraight again to the father,
&amp; other friends of the Bride, with atteſtatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
before God and their idols, that hee deliuer
the dowry wholly and truely at the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
&amp; hold loue euer after, one kinred
with another. Wherupon they break the loaf
into pieces, &amp; eate of it, to teſtifie their true
&amp; ſincere meanings, for performing of that
charge, and thenceforth to become as grains
of one loafe, or men of one table.</p>
            <p>Theſe ceremonies being ended, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome
taketh the Bride by the hand, and
ſo they goe on together, with their friendes
after them, towardes the Church porche.
Where meete the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certein with pots, &amp; cups
in their handes, with meade and <hi>Ruſſe</hi> wine.
Whereof the Bridegroome taketh firſt a
charke, or little cuppe full in his hand, and
drinketh to the Bride: who opening her
hood, or vale below, and putting the cup to
her mouth vnderneath it (for beeing ſeene
of the Bridegroome) pleadgeth him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.
Thus returning altogether from the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:2440:105"/>
Church, the Bridegroome goeth not home
to his owne, but to his fathers houſe, and
ſhe likewiſe to hers, where either intertayn
their friends apart. At the entring into the
houſe, they vſe to fling corne out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
vpon the Bridegroome, and Bride, in
token of plentie, and fruitfulnes to bee with
them euer after.</p>
            <p>When the Euening is come, the Bride is
brought to the Bridegrooms fathers houſe,
and there lodgeth that night, with her vale
or couer ſtill ouer her head. All that night
ſhe may not ſpeak one word (for that charge
ſhe receiueth by tradition from her mother,
and other matrones her friendes) that the
Bridegroome muſt neither heare, nor ſee
her, till the day after the marriage. Neither
three dayes after, may ſhee bee hearde to
ſpeake, ſaue certeyne fewe wordes at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
in a ſet forme with great manners, and
reuerence to the Bridegroome. If ſhe behaue
her ſelfe otherwiſe, it is a great preiudice
to her credite, and life euer after: and will
highly be diſliked of the Bridegroome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
            <p>After the third day, they depart to their
owne, and make a feaſt to both their friends
together. The marriage day, and the whole
time of their feſtiuall, the Bridegroome hath
the honour to bee called <hi>Moloday Knez,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:2440:106"/>
or yong Duke, and the Bride <hi>Moloday Kne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zay,</hi>
or young Dutcheſſe.</p>
            <p>In liuing with their wiues, they ſhewe
themſelues to be but of a barbarous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
vſing them as ſeruants, rather then
wiues. Except the Noble-women, which are,
or ſeeme to be of more eſtimation with their
huſbands, then the reſt of meaner ſort. They
haue this fowle abuſe, contrary to good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and the worde of God it ſelfe, that vpon
diſlike of his wife, or other cauſe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
the man may goe into a Monaſterie and
ſhire himſelfe a Frier, by pretence of deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and ſo leaue his wife to ſhift for her ſelfe
ſo well as ſhe can.</p>

themſelues continually with it, on their

Which were leſſe offence, if they gaue not

vſed the dumbe ſhewe, and ſigning of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteede

which they owe vnto God. When they

the ſight of ſome ſteeple, that hath acroſſe
on the toppe: and ſo bowing themſelues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
the croſſe, ſigne themſelues withal on

thankſgiuing to God for their nightes reſt,
without any word ſpeaking, except perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
they ſay, <hi>Aſpody Pomeluy,</hi> or <hi>Lorde

to meate, and riſe againe from it, the thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing

and breſts. Except it be ſome few that
adde peraduenture, a worde or two of ſome
ordinarie prayer, impertinent to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
When they are to giue an oath for the
deciding of anie controuerſie at Lawe, they
doe it by ſwearing by the Croſſe, and kiſsing
the feet of it, making it as God, whoſe name
onely is to bee vſed in ſuch triall of iuſtice.
When they enter into any houſe (where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

<pb facs="tcp:2440:107"/>
they ſigne themſelues with the croſſe, &amp; bow

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
is all their prayer to God, for good
ſpeede of their buſineſſe. And thus they
ſerue God with croſſes, after a croſſe and
vaine maner: not vnderſtanding what the
croſſe of Chriſt is, nor the power of it. And
yet they thinke all ſtrangers Chriſtians, to
be no better then Turkes, in compariſon of
themſelues (and ſo they wil ſay) becauſe they

of proceſsion in this order as followeth.
Firſt goe two Deacons, with banners in their
hands, the one of <hi>Precheſte</hi> (or our Ladie) the

Then follow after, the reſt of the Deacons &amp;

the prieſts of <hi>Mosko,</hi> two &amp; two in a ranke,
with coaps on their backs, and their idols at

made faſt about their necks. Next the prieſts
come their Biſhops in their pontificalibus:

the Patriarches, in very rich attite, with a
ball, or ſphere on the top of his myter, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
his vniuerſalitie ouer that Church. Laſt
commeth the Emperor with all his nobility.
The whole traine is of a mile long, or more.
When they are come to the riuer, a great
hole is made in the yſe, where the market is
kept, of a rod and a halfe broad, with a ſtage
round about it to keepe off the preſſe. Then
beginneth the Patriarch to ſay certaine prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and coniureth the diuel to come out of
the water: and ſo caſting in ſalt, and cenſing
it with frankincenſe, maketh the whole riuer

all the people of <hi>Mosko</hi> vſe to make croſſes
of chawlke ouer euerie doore, and window

            <p>When the ceremonies are ended, you ſhal

alſo ſee the women dippe in their children o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

The like is done by other Biſhops, in al parts

to God, Whereby they kill many, through

This in their proceſsions, they carry about
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2440:108"/>

the people crying <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> &amp; ſpreding their

of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When euery Biſhop in his Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
Church ſetteth forth a ſhew of the three
children in the Ouen. Where the Angell is
made to come flying from the roofe of the
Church, with great admiration of the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
on, and many terrible ſlaſhes of fire, are
made with roſen, and gun-powder, by the

Fridayes throughout the whole yeere, (the

the Wedneſday, the other becauſe he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on the Friday) they haue foure great
Faſtes, or Lentes euery yeere. The firſt,
(which they call their great Lent) is at the
ſame time with ours. The ſecond, about
Midſommer. The third, in Harueſt time. The
fourth, about Hallontide: which they keepe
not of pollicie, but of meere ſuperſtition. In
their great Lent for the firſt weeke, they eate
nothing but bread and ſalt, and drinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but water, neither meddle with anie
matter of their vocation, but intende their
ſhriuing, and faſting only. They haue alſo 3.
<hi>Vigils,</hi> or <hi>Wakes</hi> in their great Lent, which
they cal <hi>Stoiania</hi> &amp; the laſt Friday their great
<hi>Vigil,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vigils.</note> as they cal it. What time the whole pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
muſt bee preſent in the Church, and
watch from nine a clocke in the Euening, til
ſixe in the morning, all the while ſtanding,
ſaue when they fall downe, and knock their
heads to their idoles, which muſt be an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2440:109"/>
and ſeuentie times, iuſt through the
whole night.</p>
            <p>About their burials alſo,<note place="margin">Burials.</note> they haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
ſuperſtitious and prophane ceremonies:
as putting within the finger of the corpes, a
letter to Saint <hi>Nicolas:</hi> whome they make
their chiefe mediatour, and as it were, the
porter of heauen gates, as the Papiſtes doe
their <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Winter time, when all is couered with
ſnow, and the ground ſo hard frozen, as that
no ſpade, nor pikeaxe can enter their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is not to burie their dead, but to keepe
the bodies (ſo many as die all the Winter
time) in an houſe, in the ſuburbs, or outparts
of the towne, which they call <hi>Bohſedom,</hi> that
is, <hi>Gods houſe:</hi> where the dead bodies are py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vp together, like billets on a woodſtack,
as hard with the froſt as a very ſtone, till the
Springtide come, &amp; reſolueth the froſt: what
time euery man taketh his dead friend, and

            <p>They haue beſides their yeeres and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths
mindes,<note place="margin">Moneths mindes.</note> for their friendes departed.
What time they haue praiers ſaide ouer the
graue by the Prieſt: who hath a penie ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
for his paines. When any dieth, they
haue ordinary women mourners, that come
to lament for the dead party: and ſtand how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
ouer the bodie, after a prophane, and
<pb facs="tcp:2440:110"/>
heatheniſh manner (ſometimes in the houſe,
ſomtimes bringing the bodie into the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
asking him what hee wanted, and what

            <p>Many other vaine and ſuperſtitious cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
they haue, which were long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious

exchanged the worde of God, for their

great ceſterne of Copper by it, full of yſe
and ſnow, wherein ſtande the pottes that
ſerue for that meale. The taſter holdeth the
cup that he drinketh in all dinner time, and
deliuereth it vnto him with a ſay, when hee
calleth for it. The manner is to make many
diſhes out of the ſeruice after it is ſet on
the table, and to ſend them to ſuch Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and officers, as the Emperour liketh
beſt. And this is counted a great fauour, and
honour.</p>
            <p>After dinner hee layeth him downe to
reſte, where commonly hee taketh three
houres ſleepe, except he employ one of the
houres to bathing, or boxing. And this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
for ſleeping after dinner, is an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
matter with him, as withall the <hi>Ruſſes.</hi>
After his ſleepe, he goeth to euen ſong (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Vechurna</hi>) and thence returning, for the
moſt parte recreateth himſelf with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
till ſupper time, with ieſters, and
dwarfes, men and women, that tumble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, and ſing many ſongs after the <hi>Ruſſe</hi>
manner. This is his common recreation
betwixt meales, that hee moſte delightes in.
<pb facs="tcp:2440:113"/>
On other ſpeciall recreation is the fight with
wilde Beares, which are caught in pittes, or
nets, and are kepte in barred cages for that
purpoſe, againſt the Emperour be diſpoſed
to ſee the paſtime. The fight with the Beare
is on this ſort. The man is turned into a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
walled round about, where he is to quite
himſelfe ſo well as he can: for there is no way
to flie out. When the Beare is turned looſe
he commeth vpon him with open mouth.
If at the firſt puſhe hee miſſe his aime, ſo that
the Beare come within him, hee is in great
daunger. But the wilde Beare being very
fearſe, hath this qualitie, that giueth aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to the Hunter. His manner is when
he aſſaileth a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to riſe vp right on his two
hinder legges, and ſo to come roaring with
open mouth vpon him. And if the Hunter
then can puſhe right into the very breſt of
him betwixt his forelegges (as commonly
hee will not miſſe) reſting the other ende of
their boareſpeare at the ſide of his foote, &amp; ſo
keeping the pike ſtill towards the face of the
Beare, he ſpeedeth him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly at one blow.
But many times theſe Hunters come ſhort,
and are either ſlaine, or miſerably torne with
the teeth &amp; talents of the fierce beaſt. If the
partie quite himſelfe well in this fight with
the Beare, he is carried to drinke at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
ſeller doore: where he drinketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2440:113"/>
drunke for the honor of <hi>Hospodare.</hi> And
this is his rewarde for aduenturing his life,
for the Emperours pleaſure. To maintain this
paſtime the Emperor hath certein huntſmen
that are appointed for that purpoſe to take
the wild Beare. This is his recreation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
on the holy daies. Somtimes he ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his time in looking vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his goldſmiths,
and Iewellers, tailers, embroderers, painters,
&amp; ſuch like, &amp; ſo goeth to his ſupper. When
it draweth towaeds bed time, his prieſt ſaieth
certein praiers: and then the Emperour bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
and croſſeth himſelfe, as in the morning
for a quarter of an houre or thereaboutes,
and ſo goeth to his bedde.</p>
            <p>The Emperour that now is (called <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore
Iuanowich</hi>) is for his perſon of a meane
ſtature, ſomewhat lowe and groſſe, of a

by reaſon of ſome weakenes of his lims, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie

to a laughter. For qualitie otherwiſe,
ſimple and ſlowe witted, but verie gentle,
and of an eaſie nature, quiet, mercifull, of no
martiall diſpoſition, nor greatly apt for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of pollicie, very ſuperſtitious, and infinite
that way. Beſides his priuate deuotions at

publique ſtate and
vſage of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.
As touching
the naturall habite of their bodies, they are
for the moſt parte of a large ſiſe, and of very
fleſhly bodies: accounting it a grace to bee
ſomewhat groſſe and burley, and therefore
they nouriſh and ſpread their beardes, to
haue them long and broad. But for the moſt
part they are very vnweldy &amp; vnactiue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
Which may bee thought to come partly
of the climate, and the numbnes which they
get by the cold in winter, and partly of their
diet that ſtandeth moſt of rootes, onions,
garlike, cabbage, and ſuch like things that
breed groſſe humors, which they vſe to eate
alone, and with their other meates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:2440:116"/>
Their diet is rather much then curious
At their meales they beginne commonly
with a <hi>Chark</hi> or ſmall cuppe of <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Their diet.</note>
(which they call <hi>Ruſſe</hi> wine) and then drinke
not till towardes the ende of their meales,
taking it in largely, and all together, with
kiſsing one another, at euery pledge. And
therefore after dinner there is no talking
with them, but euery man goeth to his bench
to take his afternoones ſleepe, which is as
ordinary with them as their nightes reſte.
When they exceede, and haue varietie of
diſhes, the firſt are their baked meates (for
roſte meates they vſe little) and then their
broathes, or pottage. To drinke drunke, is
an ordinary matter with them euery day in
the weeke. Their common drinke is <hi>Mead,</hi>
the poorer ſort vſe water, and a thin drinke
called <hi>Quaſſe,</hi> which is nothing els (as wee
ſay) but water turned out of his wittes, with
a little branne meaſhed with it.</p>
            <p>This diet would breede in them many
diſeaſes, but that they vſe bathſtoues, or hote
houſes in ſteede of all phiſicke, commonly
twiſe or thriſe euery weeke. All the winter
time, and almoſt the whole Sommer, they
heat there <hi>Peaches,</hi> which are made lyke the
<hi>Germane</hi> bathſtoaues, and their <hi>Potlads</hi> like

their skinnes beyng tanned and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
both with colde and with heate: ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the women, that for the greater parte are

Whereof the cauſe take to bee their kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
within the hote houſes, and buſying
themſelues about the heating, and vſing of
their bathſtoues, and peaches.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ruſſe</hi> becauſe that hee is vſed to
both theſe extremities of heat and of cold,
can beare them both a great deale more
patiently, then ſtraungers can doo. You
ſhal ſee them ſometimes (to ſeaſon their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
come out of their bathſtoues all on a
froth, and fuming as hote almoſt as a pigge
at a ſpitte, and preſently to leape into the
riuer ſtarke naked, or to powre colde wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all ouer their bodies, and that in the
coldeſt of all the winter time. The women
to mende the bad hue of their skinnes, vſe
to paint their faces with white and redde co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
ſo viſibly, that euery man may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
it. Which is made no matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

them colours to paint their faces withall,
<pb facs="tcp:2440:117"/>
and delight themſelues much to ſee them
of fowle women to become ſuch faire ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

            <p>They apparell themſelues after the

on this faſhion. Firſt a <hi>Taffia</hi> or little night
cappe on his head, that couereth little more
then his crowne, commonlie verie riche
wrought of ſilke and gold thread, &amp; ſet with
pearle &amp; pretious ſtone. His head he keepeth
ſhauen cloſe to the very skin, except he be in
ſome diſpleaſure with the Emperour. Then
hee ſuffereth his haire to growe and hang
downe vpon his ſhoulders, couering his face
as vgly and deformedly as he can, Ouer the
<hi>Taffia</hi> he weareth a wide cap of black Foxe
(which they account for the beſt furre) with
a <hi>Tiara</hi> or long bonnet put within it, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vp like a <hi>Perſian</hi> or <hi>Babilonian</hi> hat. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his neck (which is ſeene al bare) is a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
ſet with pearle and pretious ſtone, about
three or foure fingers broad. Next ouer his
ſhirt, (which is curiouſly wrought, becauſe he
ſtrippeth himſelfe into it in the Sommer
time, while he is within the houſe) is a <hi>Shepon,</hi>
or light garment of ſilke made downe to the
knees, buttoned before: &amp; then a <hi>Caftan</hi> or a
cloſe coat buttoned, and girt to him with a
<hi>Perſian</hi> girdle, whereat he hanges his kniues
and ſpoone. This commonly is of cloth of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:2440:117"/>
gold, and hangeth downe as low as his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles,
Ouer that he weareth a loſe garment of
ſome rich ſilke, furred and faced about with
ſome gold lace, called a <hi>Ferris.</hi> An other ouer

When hee goeth abroad, he caſteth ouer all
theſe (which are but ſleight (though they
ſeeme to be many) an other garment called
an <hi>Honoratkey,</hi> like to the <hi>Alkaben,</hi> ſaue that
it is made without a coller for the neck. And
this is commonly of fine cloth, or Camels

earerings (which they call <hi>Sargee</hi>) of two
inches or more compaſſe, the matter of gold
ſet with Rubies, or Saphires, or ſome like
pretious ſtone. In Sommer they goe often
with kerchieffes of fine white lawne, or Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke,
faſtned vnder the chinne, with two
long taſſels pendent. The kerchiefe ſpotted
and ſet thicke with rich pearle. When they

The poorer ſort of them haue their <hi>Odnorat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi>
or vpper garment, made of Kowes haire.
This is their winter habite. In the ſommer
time, commonly they weare nothing but
their ſhirts on their backes, and buskins on
their legges. The woman goeth in a redde or
blew gowne, when ſhe maketh the beſt ſhew,
and with ſome warme <hi>Shube</hi> of furre vnder
it in the winter time. But in the Sommer, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:2440:119"/>
but her two ſhirts (for ſo they call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)
one ouer the other, whether they be within
doores, or without. On their heades, they
weare caps of ſome coloured ſtuffe, many of
veluet, or of cloth of golde: but for the moſt
part kerchiefes. Without earings of ſiluer or
ſome other mettall, and her croſſe about her
necke, you ſhal ſee no <hi>Ruſſe</hi> woman, be ſhee
wife, or maide.</p>
            <p>As touching their behauiour,<note place="margin">Their wits and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> and quality
otherwiſe, they are of reaſonable capacities,
if they had thoſe means that ſome other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
haue to traine vp their wittes in good
nurture, and learning. Which they might
borrowe of the <hi>Polonians;</hi> and other their
neighbours, but that they refuſe it of a very
ſelf pride, as accounting their owne faſhions
to be far the beſt. Partly alſo (as I ſaid before)
for that their manner of bringing vp (voide
of all good learning, and ciuill behauiour) is
thought by their gouernours moſt agreable
to that State, and their manner of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Which the people would hardely
beare, if they were once ciuilled, &amp; brought
to more vnderſtanding of God, and good
policie. This cauſeth the Emperours to keep
out al meanes of making it better, and to be
very warie for excluding of all peregrinitie,
that might alter their faſhions. Which were
leſſe to bee diſliked, if it ſet not a print into
the very mindes of his people. For as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2440:119"/>
are verie hardlie and cruellie dealte
withall by their chiefe Magiſtrates, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuperiours, ſo are they as cruell one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
an other, ſpecially ouer their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
and ſuch as are vnder them. So that
the baſeſt &amp; wretchedeſt <hi>Chriſtianoe</hi> (as they
call him) that ſtoupeth and croucheth like a
dogge to the Gentleman, and licketh vp the
duſt that lieth at his feete, is an intollerable
tyrant,<note place="margin">Crueltie of the <hi>Ruſſe</hi> people.</note> where he hath the aduantage. By this
meanes the whole Countrie is filled with
rapine, and murder. They make no account
of the life of a man. You ſhall haue a man
robbed ſometime in the very ſtreats of their
townes, if hee goe late in the euening: and
yet no man to come forth out of his doores
to reſcue him, though hee heare him crie

Whereby it may bee gheaſſed, what they are

may bee doubted whither is the greater, the

ſo soule and not to bee named. The whole
countrie ouerfloweth with all ſinne of that
kinde. And no marueile, as hauing no lawe

            <p>As for the truth of his word, the <hi>Ruſſe</hi>
