            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN
ANSWER
TO
Papists Protesting
AGAINST
Protestant Popery:</head>
            <p>SINCE the Protester thinks my Answer to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
so great a Complement, I am resolved to
oblige him a little farther, and to complement him
very heartily, and I see no reason, but Complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
may be as good a word for Disputing, as Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
is.</p>
            <p>The Reply consisted of two parts, 1. Concerning the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representation
of a Papist. 2. Concerning the Rule of true
Representing, and I shall consider, what the Protesting Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
says to each of them.</p>
            <p>As for the First, a Misrepresenter is so foul a Character,
that no Man can wonder, if we think our selves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
to wipe off such an imputation: and therefore I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
denied the charge, and made it appear from compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his own Characters of a Papist Misrepresented, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
together, that we had not charged them falsly in
any matter of Fact, and therefore are no Misrepresenters:
for if we charge them with believing and doing nothing, but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53692:3"/>
what they themselves confess to be their Faith and Practice,
wherein is the Misrepresentation? Thus I particularly show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that all matters of Fact (excepting some points, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they disown the Doctrine of their own Church) in the
Character of the Papist Misrepresented, are confessed and
defended in the Character of the Papist Represented; and
the Protester himself acknowledges, that <hi>I have learnedly</hi> (as
he is pleased to speak) <hi>distinguished between matters of Dispute,
and of Representation;</hi> and if so, then he ought to own, that
we do not Misrepresent them: and this is all I undertook to
prove in the first part of my Reply, and for that reason gave
it the Title of, <hi>A Papist not Misrepresented by Protestants,</hi> wholly
with relation to his Character of a Papist Misrepresented,
which I had proved to contain nothing in it, which in a
strict and proper sense can be called a Misrepresentation. We
truly relate what the Faith and Practice of the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> is, and this is true Representing; and though we say their
Faith is erroneous, and their Practices corrupt or superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
contrary to the Laws of God, and the usages of the
Primitive Church; yet whether this be true or false, it is no
matter of Representation but Dispute; though we believe
thus of their Faith and Practice, we do not charge them with
believing so, and therefore do not Misrepresent a Papist.
Whether they or we be in the right is matter of Dispute,
and not to be determined by Character-making, but by an
appeal to the Laws of God, and the dictates of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the Authentick Records of the ancient Church.
While we agree about matter of Fact there can be no Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representing
on either side, for there is a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between a Misrepresentation, and a false Judgment of
things; and thus I hoped, the talk of Misrepresenting would
have been at an end.</p>
            <p>But our Author, though he confesses I am in the right,
will have us to be Misrepresenters still; He says, <hi>I declare
plainly, that Popery is really that Antichristian Religion, which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
say it is, that it teaches and practises all those fopperies, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions
and non-sense, which have at any time been charged against
it by Protestants.</hi> But I never said any such thing yet, but only
said and proved, that all matters of Fact complained of in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53692:3"/>
the Character of a Papist Misrepresented, are owned by
himself in the Character of a Papist Represented; and this, I
thought, was proof enough, that we were no Misrepresenters.
But the Title of my Reply offends him, <hi>A Papist not Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by Protestants,</hi> which he says, <hi>is a condemnation of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to all those horrid shapes and monstrous forms, it has been at
any time exposed in by Members of the Reformation;</hi> by no means!
If there have been other Misrepresentations of them, which our
Author has not yet given us an account of, I can say nothing
to them, till I see what they are; but my Title related only
to my Book, and that related only to the Character of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
Misrepresented, which our Author had given us, and I
undertook for that then, and will defend it still, that there is
no Misrepresentation in it.</p>
            <p>Of the same nature is what he adds, That <hi>I tell my Reader
in the name of all my Brethren, we charge them</hi> (the Papists) <hi>with
nothing, but what they expresly profess to believe, and what they
practise;</hi> and thus says the Protester, <hi>in this one assertion vouches
for the truth of all that infamy, and prophaneness, which is laid at
their doors:</hi> and thus, for ought I see, I am drawn in for a
great deal more than I intended; I spoke with reference to
his Characters, and now I must discharge the scores of all
Protestants since the beginning of the Reformation; but
when a Man's in, he must get out as well as he can: but would
not one wonder, that there should not be one word of his
own Characters all this while? that instead of defending
his own Misrepresentations, which he has so unjustly father'd
upon us, he should be hunting about to pick up some new
Misrepresentations for me to answer? There must be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for this, and I believe, I can guess what it is.</p>
            <p>But however he takes this occasion to ransack the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of Protestants, and to see what fine things they have
said of Papists, and to collect a new Character of a Papist
Misrepresented out of them. <hi>For since all that proceeds from a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
hand of this nature is suspected and challenged, and the double
Character of a Papist Misrepresented and Represented (about which,
as the Replier says, there is so much pother and noise) is questioned
as to its method, its sincerity, and exactness, we'll now follow our
Author's call, and learn what Popery is, from the Pens of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53692:4"/>
and especially from some of those, who are supposed to know
what Popery is.</hi> And thus our Author makes as many turnings
and doublings as ever any poor Hare did, which was almost
run down. Because I have proved, that his Character of a
Papist Misrepresented, contains no Misrepresentation in it,
properly so called, therefore forsooth we will not take Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
from a Papist, because we confute them, as soon as
they make them, which is not very civil; and therefore
hoping that we will be more civil to Protestant Characters,
he turns off the Dispute to them; never did any Man take
more pains to defend Popery, than he does to prove a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
to be Misrepresented; it seems there is something in the
World called Popery, which he is very much ashamed of,
and it is well if it does not prove to be his own beloved
Popery at last.</p>
            <p>I had told him as plainly as I could in Answer to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a Papist Misrepresented, what I called Popery, and
what I take to be the general sense of Protestants about it,
and shewed him evidently, that what he calls a Misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
is none; nay in most cases I have allow'd his own Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a Papist Represented, and surely there is no Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
in that, unless he has misrepresented a Papist him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
and why is he not satisfied with this? why so much Zeal
to prove us Misrepresenters, when we are willing to fall with
the Market, and to abate as much in the Notion and Idea of
Popery, as they are pleased to lower it? Why must we be
bound to justifie that Representation of Popery, which some
Protestants have formerly made of it, when Popery was quite
another thing, than the Bishop of <hi>Condom,</hi> and the Representer
have now made it, any more than they are bound to justifie
every thing, which <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> or <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> or <hi>Vasquez</hi>
have taught for Popery?</p>
            <p>But let us consider that Character, he has made of a
Papist out of the Writings of Protestants, only I must
put him in mind, that he must still distinguish between
matters of Representation and Dispute. If the matter of
Fact they charge them with be true, they are no Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenters;
as for their Reasons and Arguments, I will
no more undertake to defend all the reasonings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53692:4"/>
than I suppose, our Protester will all the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Papists.</p>
            <p>The first Misrepresenter, he brings upon the Stage, is
<hi>John</hi> Lord Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> in his Manual or three small
and plain Treatises, written for the use of a Lady, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
her from the danger of Popery. And all that I shall
say to this, is, that if what he transcribes out of his Book, be
a Misrepresentation, it is not a Protestant, but a Popish,
Misrepresentation. For the Archbishop cites his Authors
for what he says, as the very Title of the Chapter tells us,
which I shall here present to the Reader, with all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
and Authorities as they are Printed in his Book, and
leave the Protester to consider of a good Reason, why he
left all these Authorities out.</p>

                     <hi>The Use and Application of this Doctrine you may find
in the next Chapter, and a particular proof that some Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Roman Church</hi> destroy justice towards Men in
all relations; as the Popes power of dispensing with the duties of
all relations: their Doctrines of probabilities, of mental reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
that the intention regulates the action, that no Faith is
to be kept with Hereticks; that the Pope may depose Princes, and
dispose of their Kingdoms, pardon, nay canonize King-killers, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
Subjects from their Allegiance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know our Author calls all this Misrepresentation, but
that is not our Dispute now; but whose Misrepresentation
it is. It is plain, this is not <hi>Protestant but Popish Popery;</hi> for
not Protestants, but Papists, were the Original Authors:
And I doubt not, were it worth the while, it might easily
be proved, that the grossest Misrepresentations, which this
Author charges on Protestants, are only transcribed out of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Authors; and this he seems to own, when he is so angry
with us for proving these Misrepresentations, as he calls them,
by appealing to their own private, but approved, Doctors, who
have in plain terms asserted those things, which poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
must not repeat after them, without incurring the
Censure of Misrepresenters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53692:6"/>
Now though we grant, that every Doctrine, which we
find in Popish Authors, ought not to be accounted an Article
of the Romish Faith, yet if such Books be published by the
authority of Superiors, and when they are published and
known in the World, escape the Inquisition and the <hi>Index
expurgatorius,</hi> the Doctrines contained in them ought at least
to be looked on, as licensed and tolerated Doctrines, and
therefore consistent with the Romish Faith, not a Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of it. For will a Church so strict and severe
in its Discipline, and so jealous of Heresies, which censures
all the Ancient Fathers, and expunges out of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
every passage, which in the least savours of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
which will not entrust the People to use the Bible
for fear of their learning Heresie from it; I say will such a
Church suffer their own Doctors to publish such Opinions
to the World, as Misrepresent her own Faith and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
without condemning, or passing the least censure on
them?</p>
                  <p>And therefore though we cannot prove from these pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Doctors, what the Faith of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is,
and what all are bound to believe, who are of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
yet by their Authority we may confute the charge
of Misrepresentation. For no Protestant can be justly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
of Misrepresenting the Doctrines of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> who charges them with no Doctrines, but what are
allowed to be taught in that Church, as all those Doctrines
are, which are allowed by publick Authority to be Printed
and Read in the Communion of that Church, especially, as
I observed before, where the Press is kept under such strict
Discipline, as it is in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must not indeed charge all Papists with believing
such Doctrines, because all are not bound to believe them,
as they are to believe the Decrees and Definitions of their
Councils; but we may say, that they are not contrary to
the Faith of the Church, because all Papists are allowed to
believe them, who will; for I presume all Men are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to believe that, which any Man among them is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to teach.</p>
                  <p>However I hope, it may be some excuse to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,
that he Misrepresents only at second hand, (since
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53692:7"/>
our Author will have it to be a Misrepresentation) and
says no more than some Papists themselves say, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
all into the Credit and Authority of his Authors;
and I cannot think it a greater fault in a Protestant to give
an account of such pernicious Doctrines and Opinions, as
are owned by some of their own Writers, than it is in the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to suffer them to be published by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and to pass without any Censure, if they dislike the
Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>As for what he transcribes out of Doctor <hi>Beard</hi> and
Mr. <hi>Sutcliff,</hi> I presume, he intended we should take it all
upon his Authority; for he has not directed us, where to find
any of those passages he has cited, and it is a little too much
to read two great Books in Quarto to pick them out. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
looking on the Books we might easily perceive, that
those sayings he has transcribed out of them, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Representing but Disputing, and I never undertook to
justifie every saying in Protestant Writers against Popery;
but yet some things sounded so harsh, that I vehemently
suspected foul play, and therefore had the curiosity to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
and found it to be, as I suspected. Some passages for
which they produce their Authorities, and that very good
Authorities as the World went then, are cited by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tester,
without any Authorities, as he dealt before with the
Archbishop; or what they prove by variety of reasons, is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
Represented without any reason to back it; or their
words are curtailed, or transplaced, which alters their sense
and signification. I shall give some few instances of this out
of Mr. <hi>Sutcliff,</hi> to let the World judge, who are the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representers.</p>

This is abundantly enough to give the Reader a tast of the Protesters
honestly in Representing, and how little I am concerned in these Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
If some Protestants have charged the Doctrines and Practices of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with such consequences as they cannot justifie, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Protestants disown it, and Papists may confute it, if they please, which
will be a little more to the purpose, than to cry out so Tragically about
Misrepresenting.</p>
                  <p>But to make good this charge of Misrepresenting against us, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
with several passages out of the Homilies, concerning the worship of
Saints and Images. Now if our Church be guilty of Misrepresenting
in her very Homilies, which we are all bound to subscribe, we must
acknowledge our selves to be Misrepresenters. But wherein does the
Misrepresentation consist? Do they not set up Images in Churches? And
do they not worship them? Have they not a great number of Saints, whom
they worship with Divine Honours? The matter of fact is plain and
confessed, and therefore our Church does not misrepresent them. So
that the only Misrepresentation he can complain of, is, that he does not
like the judgment of our Church about the worship of Saints and Images,
and we cannot help that. This is the belief of our Church, and this is
our belief, and let him prove us to be Misrepresenters in this, if he can;
for that is not proved meerly by his calling it Misrepresenting.</p>
                  <p>Only I would gladly know of this Author, what he takes the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be about the worship of Images?
Whether it be Idolatry or not? If he thinks our Church charges them
with Idolatry in worshipping Images, (which I suppose he means when
he complains of Misrepresentation, and picks out some passages, which
look that way) there is the authority of Doctor <hi>Godden</hi> against him (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he has changed his mind lately) who accuses Dr. <hi>St.</hi> with contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Church of <hi>England</hi> in his charge of Idolatry upon the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and makes it a certain mark of Fanaticism to do so: and then how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we may be thought to misrepresent the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this
charge of Idolatry, we do not misrepresent the Church of <hi>England</hi> in it,
which is some satisfaction to us, that we are not Misrepresenters on both
sides. But these Men take great liberties in Representing the Faith and
Doctrines of Churches. In one Kings Reign the Church of <hi>England</hi> does
not charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with Idolatry, in the next it does; though
their Articles and Homilies be the same still: but they deal with the
Church of <hi>England</hi> no worse than they do with their own Church; in one
Age a <hi>Bellarmine</hi> truly Represents the Doctrine of their Church, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
a Bishop of <hi>Condom;</hi> and though the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> be but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53692:9"/>
one and the same, the Faith of it alters very often, as it may
best serve the interest of the Catholick Cause.</p>
                  <p>Our Author having exposed <hi>the Protestant Character</hi> (as
he calls it) <hi>of a Papist,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Papists Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>which he always looked upon no other,
than of a Papist Misrepresented,</hi> he falls a commending the zeal
of Protestants against such Popery with great earnestness and
passion, and therein we agree with him, as believing it to be
very commendable; and do not doubt (as he says) but
<hi>those Martyrs recorded by</hi> Fox, <hi>who for not embracing this Popery
passed the fiery Tryal, had surely a glorious Cause, and that the
Triumphs and Crowns of Glory, which waited for them in Heaven,
were not inferior to what those enjoyed, who suffered under</hi> Decius
<hi>or</hi> Dioclesian. I agree with him also, <hi>that there is no need of
any longer disagreement, that there is no necessity of keeping up names of
division; that Protestant and Papist may now shake hands, and by one
subscription close into a Body, and joyn in a fair and amicable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence:</hi>
For if (as he says) there is no Papist, but will
<hi>give his hand for the utter suppressing this kind of Popery,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 1<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> I see no
reason, why they may not joyn in Communion with the
Church of <hi>England</hi> which has suppressed it. But I am not of
his mind, that all the Strife <hi>has been about a word;</hi> for the
Dispute has been about the Worship of Saints, and Images,
about Transubstantiation, worshipping the Host, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in one kind, Service in an unknown Tongue, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and the use of the Holy Scriptures, the Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
Indulgences, Purgatory, the Popes Supremacy, and
several other material differences; which are something more
than a meer Word; will they now part with all these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Practices, <hi>since they have been informed by great and
good authorities,</hi> what the nature and evil tendency of these things
is? No! by no means, they will retain all these Doctrines and
Practices still, but will renounce and abhor all that evil, which
Protestants charge them with. They will pray to Saints, and
worship Images still, but they will abhor all Heathenish Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in such Worship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but what reason is this for Protestants
to joyn with them in one Communion, while they retain the
same Faith and Worship, which at first made a separation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and we retain the same opinion of their Faith and
Worship, which ever we had? If Papists be the same, &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
the same, that ever they were, if Separation were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53692:10"/>
once necessary, surely it is so still. What change is there
now in Papists, which was not before, that should now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
us to embrace their Communion? Yes they abhor all
that which Protestants call Popery. This is good news, but
let us a little better understand it. Do they abhor the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Saints and Images, and the Host? Do they abhor
the Doctrines of Transubstantiation, Penances, Indulgences,
Purgatory? Do they renounce the Popes Supremacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
no such matter! but they abhor those Opinions, which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
have of these things; did they then ever believe that
these Doctrines and Practices were so bad, as Protestants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
did, and to this day, say they are? if not, what change
is there in them, that should invite us now to a reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Did Protestants separate from Papists, because they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that Papists thought Idolatry lawful? If not, why
is their abhorring Idolatry, while they do the same things,
that ever they did, a sufficient reason for a re-union? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
some Common-wealths-men, who take up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King, should tell the Royalists, who fight for him,
that they have all this while mistaken one another, that for
their parts they hate Rebellion, as much as they can do, and
have been greatly misrepresented by those who have called
them Rebels; <hi>the strife has been only about a word,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is time for them now to joyn all together, not in their
duty to their Prince, but in opposing him; though I dare
not smile at our Author for fear of his displeasure again, yet
I fancy a good Subject would entertain such a proposal with
a very disdainful smile.</p>
                  <p>And therefore as for misrepresenting, our Author may
complain on till he is a weary, but he can never prove us
to be Misrepresenters, while they still own that Faith and
Worship, which we charge them with, and if he thinks we
censure their Doctrine and Worship too severely, let him vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
it, when he can.</p>
                  <p>In my Reply I considered, what were the faults of his two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Character of <hi>a Papist misrepresented, and represented,</hi> and
shall now briefly examine, what he says to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As for the Character of a Papist misrepresented, I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
1. That he put such thing's into the Character, as no Man in
his wits ever charged them with: <hi>As</hi> that Papists are not permitted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53692:10"/>
to hear Sermons, which they are able to understand, or that they held it
lawful to commit Idolatry; or that the Papist believes the Pope to be his
great God, and to be far above all Angels, <hi>which the Answerer calls</hi>
Childish and wilful mistakes. And yet <hi>(says the Protester,</hi> p. 19.)
those very things almost in express terms, and others far more absurd,
we see charged on them, as is shewed above; <hi>that is in the Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
out of the Archbishop and others. But I can see no such
thing, unless the</hi> Supremum numen in terris <hi>(as</hi> Stapleton <hi>calls</hi> Greg.
13.) <hi>signifie that the Pope is their great God, and then I must
beg his pardon, that I did not think any Man in his wits so silly,
as it seems some of their own great Divines have been, for this
is not a Protestant, but a Popish representation of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. I found fault,<note place="margin">Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Opinions of Protestants concerning Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Doctrines and Practices, and those ill consequents which are charged
and justly charged upon them, are put into the Character of a Papist
misrepresented, as if they were his avowed Doctrine and Belief.</hi> For
whosoever gives a Character of a Papist, ought only to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
what his Faith and Practice is, not what Opinion, he, who
gives the Character, has of his Faith and Practice: for this does
not belong to the Character of a Papist, but only signifies his
own private Judgment, who gives the Character: while we
charge Papists only with matter of Fact, what they believe and
what they practise, this is a true Character, and no Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting;
but if we put our own Opinions of his Faith and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
into his Character, this is Misrepresenting, because a Papist
has not the same Opinion of these things, which we have, and
this makes it a false Character.</p>
                  <p>To this the Protester answers. <hi>p. 20. This is a pretty speculative
quarrel, I confess, and might deservedly find room here, were it our business
to consider the due method of misrepresentation in the abstract: But as our
present concern stands, here's a quaint conceit lost for coming in a wrong place.
For what had the Author of the Misrepresentation to do with these Rules?
He did not intend to misrepresent any Body.</hi> This is very pleasant! a
Man, who undertakes to make Characters, is not bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
what a Character is, nor what belongs to representing, nor
misrepresenting. Any Man would have thought so indeed, who
had read his Characters, but I never expected, that he should have
said so. But <hi>he did not intend to misrepresent any Body,</hi> and therefore
had nothing to do with those Rules; but he intended, it seems,
to give an account, how Papists are misrepresented by Protestants,
and therefore ought to have understood, what is Misrepresenting,
and not have called that Misrepresenting, which is not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:53692:11"/>
But <hi>his Province</hi> (he says) <hi>was only to draw forth the Character of a
Papist, as it is commonly apprehended by the Vulgar or the Multitude,
with the common prejudices and mistakes that generally attend such a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Now I would fain know, whether this Character, as it lies in the
Peoples heads, is distinguished into antecedents and consequents; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they, when they hear one declaiming against Popery for committing
Idolatory, as bad or worss than that of the grossest Heathens, worshipping
Stocks and Stones for Gods, distinguisheth between the Doctrine of the
Papists, and these interpretations and consequences charged against it.</hi>
—Thus in short he tells us,<note place="margin">P. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>The Character of a Papist Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
was intended only, as the Author expresses himself in his intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
for a Copy of Popery as painted in the imagination of the Vulgar,
and if it be conform to that, it is exact and perfect; and if there be any
faults in it, the blame must fall on those, who drew the Original.</hi> This
is the sum of his excuse for putting such things into the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a Papist Misrepresented, as do not belong to Character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making,
nor are in a strict and proper sense Misrepresentations.
That the common People, who do not distinguish between An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents
and Consequents, have such an idea and notion of a
Papist, as he has described in the Character of a Papist Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>represented.
Well, suppose this, how does this mend the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
If his Character of a Papist Misrepresented, be no misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation,
then our People, who have this notion of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
are not Misrepresenters. Now this is that, which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
to prove in my Reply. That there is nothing of misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation,
properly so called, in his Character of a Papist Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented;
It is a false Character indeed, because it contains such
things, as are not matters of Representation, but of Dispute, and
therefore do not belong to a Character; but separate matters of Fact
from matters of Opinion and Dispute, as I have particularly done in
my Reply, and the Character of a Papist Misrepresented contains no
matter of Fact, excepting some very few things, but what the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of the Papist Represented owns. And therefore as far as it
can be called a Character, it is a true one. And if this (as he says) <hi>be
a Copy of- Popery- as painted in the imagination of the Vulgar,</hi> the Original
can have no more of misrepresentation in it, than the Copy has.</p>
                  <p>But though the Protester does acknowledge, that there is a
real difference between Representing the Doctrines and Practices
of Papists, and declaring our own Judgment and Opinion
concerning them,<note place="margin">P. 20.</note> he suspects the People <hi>do not distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Antecedents and Consequents, between the Doctrines of the
Papists and these interpretations and consequences charged on it.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53692:11"/>
They swallow all down greedily in the lump, Antecedents and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents
go down with them all at once.</hi> But what does he mean
by this? that any Protestant People are so silly as to think
that Papists believe as bad of their own Religion, as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
of it? That Papists believe Idolatry to be lawful, as
he tells us in the Character of a Papist Misrepresented; or
that they believe the Worship of an Image to be Idolatry?
no, I assure him, our People are taught, what Popery is <hi>in
its genuine purity,</hi> as he speaks; they know in the most mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
points, what the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is, and
are taught, what to think of it; and when they hear or read
our Disputes against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are not so weak
as to believe, that we and Papists have the same Opinions
about Worshipping Saints and Images, and the Host, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
and therefore are not in danger of affixing such Opinions on
Papists, as they hear us charge on Popery. So that this is a very
needless fear he is in, and if nothing else hinders, he may (as he
promises) reform his Character of a Papist Misrepresented.</p>
                  <p>I must confess we are pretty positive in declaring to our
People the evil and danger of Popery. We tell them what
we think of it, not as <hi>thinking</hi> signifies doubtfulness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty,
but an assured perswasion founded on Reason, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
and the best Authorities: as he complains, <hi>that we go
beyond thinking,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>and instead of saying we think so, we positively say,
so it is.</hi> But if we are in the right, there is no hurt in this, and
we shall believe so, till they can prove, that we are in the
wrong; we do not indeed pretend to Infallibility, but we think
our selves as certain, as those who do.</p>
                  <p>This is the sum of what he says in defence of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a Papist Misrepresented, that though he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
my distinction to be good between Matters of Dispute
and of Representation; and consequently that his Character
of a Papist Misrepresented has nothing of misrepresentation
in it, truly so called; yet he says, this is the Idea of a Papist,
as it is commonly apprehended by the Vulgar, who do not
distinguish between Antecedents and Consequents, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they hear said of Popery, they take to be the Faith of a
Papist, without distinguishing what it is the Papists own, and
believe, and practise, and what guilt Protestants charge them
with for thus believing and doing: that when they hear the
Papists charged with Idolatry for Worshipping Images, they
as verily think, that Papists believe Idolatry to be lawful, as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53692:12"/>
they do, that they believe it lawful to Worship Images. If
there be any among us so very silly, I dare say, they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Read nor Write, and therefore he might have spared his
pains in writing and printing Characters for them; and if his
Character of a Papist (as he says) be what he thought of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist,
while he himself was a Protestant, it seems he was in a
very low dispensation then, and could not himself <hi>distinguish
between Antecedents and Consequents, but swallowed all down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
though he is now improved into a Writer of Characters;
and may they never have any wiser Converts. However this
does plainly yield the cause, that the Protestant Clergy, and
understanding Gentry and Laity, who can distinguish between
Antecedents and Consequents, are no Misrepresenters; and as
for others, we fear, they have a great many more Misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
on their side, than we hope, we have on ours.</p>
                  <p>Let us now consider his Character of a Papist Represented,
and what the faults of that are. Now the general fault is, that
whereas one might reasonably expect, that there should be
some difference between the Character of a Papist Misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
and of a Papist Represented, and he has endeavoured
to make his Readers believe, that there is, yet in truth there is
none in most parts of the Character. For what does strictly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to Representation, that is, all matter of Fact, is the same
in both. For, 1. He having put the Opinions of Protestants
concerning Popish Doctrines and Practices into the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
of a Papist Misrepresented, as if they were his avowed
Doctrine and Belief; in the Character of a Papist Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
he denies, that he believes those Interpretations and
Consequences; and this he might very easily do, because (as
he observes, <hi>p. 24.) no body charges him with that belief;</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he says, <hi>then he contradicts no Body, and he hopes there is no fault
in that,</hi> he is so far in the right; but his fault is, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
upon his Reader, with an appearance of a Misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
when there is none; and by his denying that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
such things, would perswade the World, that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
charge Papists with believing all these ill things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which we say of their Faith and Worship; a sign that
he was hard put to it, to find out some Protestant Misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of Papists. And 2. As for matter of Fact, which alone
is proper for a Character, <hi>he generally owns the Doctrines and
Practices we charge them with;</hi> and his saying, <hi>how could this pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be otherwise, if they charge us with <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore, but what we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53692:12"/>
profess to own</hi> (in which he reflects upon what I had said
in my Reply, that we charge them with believing nothing, but
what they expresly profess to believe) is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
for it is not absolutely <hi>what we charge them with,</hi> but
what he himself makes us charge them with in his Character
of a Papist Misrepresented, and calls us Misrepresenters for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so, that he owns in the Character of a Papist Represented,
as I particularly shewed in my Reply; now the question is,
why he calls one Character a Misrepresentation, and the other
a Representation, when the matter of Fact is the same in both?</p>
                  <p>But then (3.) I observed, <hi>that in some cases he disowns that to
be the doctrine and belief of their Church, which manifestly is so,
and has been proved on them, beyond all possibility of a fair Reply,
by the learned Answerer.</hi> To which he Answers: <hi>then for all his
word, we are in some cases charged with more than we expressly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to believe.</hi> But he must know we do not take the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Roman Faith from every private Character-maker,
but from the authentick Records of their Church; and if
they deny what their Church teaches, and requires them to
believe, it is not indeed their Faith, but yet it ought to be so:
and though he may huff at <hi>manifestly and proving,</hi> I suspect,
he will take a little time before he brings it to the Tryal.</p>
                  <p>This is a sufficient answer to his fresh complaint of Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations.
I now proceed to the second part of the Reply,
The rule of true Representing, or the Rule whereby the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is to be known. He appealed to
the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the Catechism <hi>ad Par<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>chos,</hi> and these
I acknowledged to be authentick Rules; but since Catholick
Divines differ about the sense of the Council and Catechism,
the question is, Why we must prefer his sense of the Council
and Catechism before Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s, or any other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of Note and Eminency in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
lived since the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and may be presumed to
understand the meaning of it, as well as the Representer;
and therefore to remove this difficulty in his Reflections he
appealed to the Bishop of <hi>Condom,</hi> as the Authentick Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitor
of the Council and Catechism, and told us, how his
Book had been approved by many Bishops, and Cardinals,
and by the present Pope himself, and therefore has the <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the See Apostolick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I answered in my Reply <hi>(p. 44.)</hi> that the attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given to Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Controversies was not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53692:13"/>
to that given to the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Exposition of the
Doctrine of the Catholick Church; that it was Dedicated to
Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. and that with the Popes leave and good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
which is not much inferior to a testimonial under the
Popes hand; and why then are not <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Controversies
as authentick a rule for the Exposition of the Catholick
Faith, as the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s? But to this he thought fit to
answer nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And whereas he pretends that the Popes approbation gives
it the authority of</hi> the Apostolick. See: <hi>I acquainted him out of</hi>
Melchior Canus; That the name of the Apostolick See does not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the Pope in his private capacity, but in his Chair, or doing such
things, and in such a manner, as belong to the Papal Chair, that is,
not giving his own private sense, but proceeding in Council with the
advice of good and learned Men; and therefore that is not to be
accounted the Judgment of the Apostolick See, which is given only
by the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> privately, maliciously, and inconsiderately,
or with the advice only of some few of his own mind, but what he
determines upon a due examination of the thing, by the advice and
Counsel of many wise Men.</p>
                  <p>To this the Protester answers <hi>that it is only an ungrounded
and ill-turned consequence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>that because that is not to be accounted
the judgment of the Apostolick See, which is given only by the Pope,
privately, maliciously, and inconsiderately, or with the advice only of
some few of his own mind, therefore this learned Prelates Expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Catholick Faith is to be thrown by, as of no Authority; so
that our Replier has here concluded without any more ado, that the
approbation of this Book was only given privately, maliciously, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately,
or else with the advice only of some few of the Popes
own mind, otherwise the Consequence will not hold.</hi> But I thought
<hi>Canus</hi> had told us, what was necessary to make the Popes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
the judgment of the Apostolick See, as well as what
hinders it from being so. That the Pope must give judgment
according to the due form and method of proceedings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Apostolick Chair, in full Council, after due exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
and with the advice of many wise Men. Now I
only desire to know, whether the Pope in a full Council of
Cardinals, did give judgment <hi>ex Cathedrâ,</hi> that the Bishop
of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Book was a true Exposition of the Catholick
Faith; For if he did not, though the Pope and all his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
should singly for themselves give their own private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and approbation of it, according to <hi>Canus</hi> his rule, it is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53692:13"/>
not the judgment of the Apostolick See; for it is a private
judgment, whether it be malicious or not, which I was
so far from <hi>concluding without more ado,</hi> that, as the Protester
observes, I did not so much as translate it, (though I put it
in the Latine Quotation in the Margin, which is an argument
I did not designedly conceal it) because I thought it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
to my purpose: and yet the Consequence holds good
without it, if it be not a judgment <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> it is not the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>the Apostolick See,</hi> which was all I intended to prove;
and our Author in his long harangue has said nothing to prove
that it was, nay is so far from that, that he avoided the very
mentioning of that, because he knew not what to say to it.
<hi>Malitiously</hi> and <hi>inconsiderately</hi> were pretty words to descant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but the <hi>Cathedra</hi> choaked him.</p>
                  <p>The truth is the principal Commendation, which is given
to the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, that it is a new way of
dealing with Hereticks, and that which they hope may be
more effectual than Disputing has been; but there is none of
them, that make it the Rule, much less the only Rule of
the Catholick Faith. Cardinal <hi>de Buillon</hi> acquaints Cardinal
<hi>Bona,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Card. <hi>Bona</hi>'s Letter.</note> 
                     <hi>that there are some</hi> (and he speaks of Catholicks) <hi>who find
some fault in it;</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Sigismond Chigi</hi> in his Letter to
the Abbot of <hi>Dangeau,</hi> though he highly commends him,
yet is far from allowing his Book to be the Standard of
the Catholick Faith, or the Authentick interpretation of the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> when he tells the Abbot, <hi>certainly it was
never his</hi> (Condom'<hi>s</hi>) <hi>intention to give the interpretation of the
Tenets of the Council, but only to deliver them in his Book right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
explicated, in such sort, that Hereticks may be convinced:</hi> that
is, he did not allow him to interpret the Council, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
him for dealing with Hereticks in a new, and, as he
thought, more advantageous method, than had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used; and to this purpose the Pope commends him, <hi>that his
Exposition of the Catholick Faith contains such Doctrine, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in such a method, and with so much prudence, that it is thereby
rendred proper to instruct the Readers clearly in few words, and to
extort even from the unwilling, a confession of th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Catholick Faith.</hi>
Now to me this seems to fall very short of making the Bishops
Exposition the Authentick interpretation of the Council of
<hi>Trent;</hi> that what ever the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi> says, is the sense
of the Council, must be acknowledged to be so, though other,
as good Catholick Divines, as famous in their Generation,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53692:14"/>
and whose Books have been received with as universal appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
are of another mind; and which signifies a little with
us Protestants, where the plain words and reason of the
Council is against him.</p>
                  <p>I would desire our Author to tell me, whether the Pope, when
he approved the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Book, did at the same time
condemn Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s, or those other Divines and
Schoolmen, who give such a different explication of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent,</hi> from what this Bishop does; if he did not, what
authority has he given to this Exposition, more than any other
Catholick Doctor may challenge? Why may we not, if we
please, follow <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> or <hi>Suarez,</hi> or <hi>Vasquez,</hi> or <hi>Cajetan,</hi> as
well as <hi>Condom?</hi> Our Author thinks it the shortest and easiest
way to decide this Controversie whether he have truly Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the Faith of a Papist, by making an experiment:
Thus he concluded his Reflections, <hi>p. 19. Do but you, or any
Friend for you</hi> (though I did not know before, that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would admit Proxies in the profession of
our Faith) <hi>give your assent to those Articles of Faith, as I
have Represented it, in the very form and manner a I have stated
them, in that Character of a Papist Represented; and if upon your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
you are not admitted into the Communion of the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
and owned to believe aright in all those points, I'le then
confess, that I have abused the World, that my Representing is Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the Faith of the Papist.</hi> To this I answered in my
Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 40. that I did believe that his Representation was
the Faith of a Papist, excepting what concerned the deposing
Doctrine, and some few other points, which I had before
particularly remarked (not that this is the whole of what
Papists believe, but that it is right as far as it goes) but we
did not like his Faith so well, as he had Represented it, as to
make the experiment. This I thought had been answer
enough for any reasonable Man, but in his Answer to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
he is still for new experiments, as being much easier than
Disputing, which he does not like, and now the trial is, <hi>That if
notwithstanding my refusal to admit the deposing Doctrine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Papists Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. <hi>p.</hi> 29.</note> 
                     <hi>and the
Popes Infallibility, but as stated by the Representer</hi> (that is, not as
Articles of Faith) <hi>I be not judged sufficiently qualified as to these
points, to be received into the Communion of the Roman Catholicks,
then he will grant, that I have reason to charge the Representer not to
have done his part in those particulars,</hi> that is, not to have truly
Represented the Faith of a Papist.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:53692:14"/>
Now in answer to this, I beg his leave, that I may take my turn
too in making Proposals, and I will do it very gravely, without
the least Smile, since I see he is offended at it, and that is this.
Suppose I should resolve to be a thorough-paced Papist, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of assenting to his Representation, should rather chuse that
Representation, which Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> has made of the Faith
of a Papist, who does not mince the matter, as to worshipping
Images, and praying to Saints, and trusting in their aid and
assistance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who makes the Popes Infallibility and his Deposing
Power an Article of Faith; should I be thought sufficiently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
as to these Points (wherein the Cardinal expresly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts
and condemns our Authors, and the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation)
to be received into the Communion of Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks?
If I should (and I will venture the Protestor to say,
that I should not) then if his Argument from Experience be good;
it is plain, That Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> has made a true Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Roman Catholick Faith; and thus we have Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
for both sides, for Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and for the Bishop
of <hi>Condom,</hi> and our Representer; and yet it is somewhat strange,
they should be all true Representers, especially in those points,
wherein they contradict each other.</p>
                  <p>This the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi> was aware of, and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
his Book with a Caution against it to those, who should
think fit to answer it. <hi>That it would be a quitting the design of this
Treatise, to examine the different Methods which Catholick Divines
make use of,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Condom'<hi>s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos.</hi> p. 51.</note> 
                     <hi>to establish or explicate the Doctrine of the Council of</hi>
Trent, <hi>and the different Consequences, which particular Doctors have
drawn from it.</hi> Which is a plain Confession, that other <hi>Catholick
Divines</hi> do not agree with him in this Method, nor allow of those
narrow Bounds, which he has set to the Catholick Faith; and
therefore it was wisely done of him to persuade his Answerers,
to take no notice of any such Disagreement, and it will be a great
piece of Civility and good Breeding in them not to do it; but how
other Catholick Divines will take this, I cannot tell.</p>
                  <p>This is enough in all Conscience concerning the Bishop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>'s
Authority, which I must still say is <hi>nothing,</hi> when we speak
of an Authentick Rule of expounding the Catholick Faith, in
which sense our Author appeals to him; though we will allow
him the Authority of a wise and prudent man, whose writings are
published and approved by Publick Authority, as the writings of
other Catholick Doctors are, which is all the Authority we Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53692:15"/>
give to our best Writers; and therefore the Protester
has no reason to complain (as he does p. 27.) of <hi>an uneven kind
of Justice and Reasoning</hi> in this matter, and whoever desires a more
particular account of the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Authority, and those
Glorious Testimonies which are given to his Book, if he be a
reasonable man, may find Satisfaction in the Preface to the late
Answer to the Bishop of <hi>Condom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the truth is, I know no reason there is for all this Dispute.
I told the Reflector before, that I did not like his Faith, though
it were as he has represented it; should we allow the Bishop of
<hi>Condom's</hi> Exposition, and his Character of a Papist represented,
to contain the true Catholick Faith, and that this is the whole
of what the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> has determined, yet I can never be
of this Religion; and since he was not satisfied with my bare
telling him so, I will now give him some Reasons for it, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
shew him, what it is I dislike in <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi>
the late Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi> his Exposition of the Doctrine of the
Church about the Object of Worship, Invocation of Saints, and
worship of Images, and take the flourishes of his Introduction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the bargain. And I chuse these Heads, because these are the
matters, wherein he principally appeals to the Bishop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and about which only he has offered any thing like an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
in his answer to my Reply: And I am as glad to take
any opportunity of useful Discourse, as our Author seems
cautious not to give any. And that neither he nor the Bishop
may have any occasion of Quarrel, I shall observe the Directions
the Bishop has given to those, who think fit to answer to his
Treatise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He tells us;</hi> To urge any thing solid against this Treatise <hi>(the
Exposition)</hi> and which may come home to the point,<note place="margin">Condom'<hi>s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos.</hi> p. 51.</note> it must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that the Churches Faith is not here faithfully expounded, and that
by Acts, which the same Church has obliged her self to receive; or else it
must be shewn, that this Explication leaves all the Objections in their
full force, and all the disputes untouched; or in fine it must be precisely
shewn, in what this Doctrine subverts the foundations of Faith. <hi>As
for the first of these, it is done already to my hand, in</hi> the Doctrines
and Practices of the Church of Rome truly represented, in answer to
the Papist misrepresented and represented. <hi>And he must be as bold a
man, who will attempt to mend that Author, as who attempts
to confute him. The other two I will have in my eye in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining,

               <p>WEre it possible to reconcile the Differences between us

matters in Controversie between us; I should think it an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Design; and this being all the Author professes to intend, I
cannot but highly commend his good Meaning in it; whether
he has shewn so much Skill and Judgment, in undertaking a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in its own nature impracticable, I shall leave to the Reader to
judge, when he has fairly heard both sides. Had I known no
more of the matter, but that the Reformation was begun by men
brought up in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately
acquainted with the Doctrines and Practices of that
Church; that some of these Corruptions, both before and since,
have been complained of by men of that Communion; that the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which was convened upon this occasion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
many Doctrines of the Reformers, as contrary to the
Catholick Faith, and guilty of Heresie; that both before and
after this Council, there have been many Volumes written, and
many fine Disputes between Popish and Protestant Divines, who
have been men of as great Learning and true Understanding in
these matters, as any the Age has bred, who did all this while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that there was a real and substantial difference between them:
I say, when I consider these things, I should not venture, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
both of Papists and Protestants, especially of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent,</hi> to say, That the Dispute has been only about Words;
that Papists and Protestants, even the most Learned men among
them, have mistaken each others Propositions; and that the only
way to reconcile this Difference, is so to state the matter in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,
that Papists and Protestants may understand each other. I
doubt not, but fierce men on both sides, may have made this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
much wider than it is: but yet such a difference there is, as
no Representing can cure, as I believe will appear by considering
Particulars.</p>

all the Fundamental Articles of the Christian Faith, to believe any

               <p>He observes indeed from <hi>M. Daille,</hi> that we ought not to charge
men with believing such Consequences, as they themselves do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
reject; nor do we charge any such thing upon the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>M. Daille</hi> never said, that we may not charge mens
Doctrines and Practices with such Consequences, as they, who
teach these Doctrines, disown; for <hi>M. Daille</hi> himself, in the place
quoted by the Bishop, charges the Opinion of the Lutherans, and
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the manner of Christ's Presence in
the Sacrament, <hi>with inferring the destruction of the Humanity of
Jesus Christ:</hi> and therefore the Bishop concludes too much, when
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53692:16"/>
he infers; <hi>It is then a certain Maxime established amongst them, that
they must not in these cases look upon the Consequences,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>which may be
drawn from a Doctrine, but purely upon what he proposes and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
who teaches it.</hi> But the use <hi>M. Daille</hi> makes of it, is only
this. That when such ill Consequences, as mens Doctrines are
justly chargeable with, have no ill influence upon Worship, or as
he speaks, <hi>no poyson</hi> in them; if they disown such Consequences,
this ought not to break Christian Communion. And therefore,
though no man ought to be received into the Communion of the
Church, who denies the Humanity of Jesus Christ; yet the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Synod at <hi>Charenton</hi> admits Lutherans to the Holy Table;
because whatever might be inferred from their Doctrine, yet they
expresly owned the Humanity of Christ; and this Doctrinal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
was a meer Speculative Error, which made no change at
all in Acts of Worship; but when the Consequences are not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speculative, but practical, and do not so much concern, what
other men believe, and think, as what we our selves are to do, as
it is in the Worship of Saints and Images, and the Host, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to
say, that we must have no regard to Consequences, if the Church
disowns them, is to say, that we must not consider the nature and
tendency of our Actions, nor what they are in Gods account,
but only what the Church thinks of them: and therefore though
we will not charge the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with believing any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences,
which she disowns; yet if her Doctrines and Practices
corrupt the Christian Faith and Worship, it is fit to charge her
with such Corruptions; and if the Charge be just, though she dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
it, it will justifie our Separation from her Communion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THE account the Bishop gives of</hi> that Interior Adoration which
is due to God alone,<note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>is very sound and Orthodox;</hi> that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
principally in believing he is the Creator and Lord of all things,
and in adhering to him with all the powers of our Soul, by Faith, Hope,
and Charity, as to him alone, who can render us happy by the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of an infinite Good, which is himself. <hi>But there are two things
I except against in this Section, as not fairly stated: First, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:53692:17"/>
the exteriour marks of Adoration. <hi>Secondly, concerning</hi> the
terminating of Religious Worship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for the first, he tells us:</hi> This interiour Adoration, which we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
unto God in Spirit and in Truth, has its exterior marks, of which the
principal is Sacrifice, which cannot be offered to any but to God: <hi>And
with respect to the second, he tells us;</hi> The same Church teaches
us, that all Religious Worship ought to terminate in God, as its necessary
End; and that if the Honour, which she renders to the Blessed Virgin,
and to the Saints, may in some sence be called Religious, it is for its
necessary relation to God.</p>
               <p>The Bishop very well knew, that this is the main Seat of the
Controversie between us, and had he intended by his Exposition,
to have put an end to our disputes; he should have taken a little
more care about this Point; for as he has now stated it, he has
left the matter just as he found it. We say, <hi>that all Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
ought not only to terminate in God, as its necessary End;</hi> but that
God is the sole and immediate Object of all Religious Worship,
and that we must worship none besides him, as our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
the Law.<note place="margin">See a late Tract of the Object of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
shalt thou serve,</hi> Matth. 4. We have always denied any relative
Worship to be due to Creatures; for to worship Creatures, is to
make them Gods, and it is no honour to the Supreme God, to
advance his own Creatures to divine Honours, to make more,
though inferiour, Gods for God's sake. We say, all external Acts
of Religious Worship, are peculiar and appropriate to God,
as well as Sacrifice; for since we must worship none but God,
whatever can be called Religious Worship, must be given to none
besides him; and the Bishop has not dealt plainly in this matter;
he says, that Sacrifice can be offered to none but God, but he has
not told us, what he thinks of other external Acts of Worship,
whether they may be paid to some excellent Creatures: for since
Sacrifice is not a natural but instituted Worship; if nothing but
Sacrifice is peculiar to God, then all external natural Worship is
common to God and Creatures, and then in the state of nature,
there could be no external and visible Difference, between the
worship of God and Creatures; nor had there been any under the
Gospel neither, had not Christ instituted his last Supper, which
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has transformed into a Sacrifice of his natural
Flesh and Blood.</p>
               <p>Thus when he says, that all <hi>Religious Worship ought to terminate
in God, as its necessary end,</hi> this seems to me an ambiguous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53692:17"/>
for Worship properly terminates in the Object to
which it is given; and in this sense, If all Religious Worship must
terminate in God, then all Religious Worship must be given to
God, and to none else; which is the true Catholick Faith, that
God is only to be worshipped. But then what becomes of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worship which is given <hi>to the Virgin Mary, and Saints, in
relation to God?</hi> Does not this Worship, which is given to them,
terminate in them, and not in God? Are not they the immediate
and proper Objects of that Worship, which is given to them?
And does not the Object terminate the Worship? Is God the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of that Worship, which they give to the Saints and Blessed
Virgin? Then they either give that inferior Degree of Worship
to God, which is proper for Creatures, which is an affront to
his Majesty and Greatness; or they give that Worship to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which is proper to God, which is Idolatry. Which plainly
shews, that that Worship, which is given to Creatures, is termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
in those Creatures to which it is given; and therefore if
any degree of Religious Worship be given to Creatures, all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worship does not terminate in God, as he said it must;
and if all Religious Worship must terminate in God, then no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Worship must be given to Creatures, as he grants it may,
to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and Saints.</p>
               <p>Yes, you will say, that Worship, which is given to the Saints
and Blessed Virgin, terminates in God, because it is given them
upon account of their Relation to God; but this is a great
mistake; their Relation to God can only serve, for a Reason why
they are worshipped; but cannot terminate that worship on God
which is given to them; because not God, but they themselves
are the Object, and the ultimate Object of that Worship, which
is given to them.</p>
               <p>Though we should grant, that God is honoured by that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which is given to some excellent Creatures, who are his
Friends and Favourites, yet the Honour we do to God in this, is
of a very different nature from that Worship, which we pay to
Creatures; it does not consist in this, that the worship we give
to Creatures is terminated on God, for it is terminated upon
those Creatures whom we worship; but the Honour must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in the Reason of our worship, that we worship them for God's
sake: It is an honour to God by Interpretation and Consequence,
as we intend it for God's Honour, or as God is pleased to think
himself honoured by it; but it is no act of Worship to God, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53692:18"/>
therefore not terminated on him. The Worship can go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than its proper Object, though the Reason of the Worship
may: For there is a great deal of difference between an Object,
and a Medium of Worship; a Medium of Worship, which is only
a representative Object, receives our Worship, but does not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
it, but convey it to that Being it represents; because it
is worshipped only in the place and stead of another, as it is in
that Worship, which is given to the Images of Christ and the
Saints; which some Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> tell us, is not
terminated on the Images, but on Christ or the Saints represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by those Images; but a proper Object of Worship, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
worship in its own proper person, for whatsoever reason it
is worshipped, it terminates the Worship; the Worship, which
is given to it, goes not beyond it self, though the Reason of the
Worship may reach farther, and be thought to reflect some Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
upon God, and to testifie our Love and Reverence for him,
by that Worship we pay to those, who are dear to him. So that
if we do give Religious Worship to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and Saints,
such Worship is terminated on them, and then all Religious
Worship is not terminated on God, as he says the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
teaches it must be, which yet teaches also the worship of Saints
and the Blessed Virgin. Methinks he should have taken care, to
have stated this matter a little plainer: For if he cannot reconcile
the Doctrine and Practice of the Church together, I fear his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
will rather increase than end Controversies.</p>
               <p>Thus how doubtfully does he speak; <hi>If the Honour she renders
to the Blessed Virgin and to the Saints, may, in some sense, be called
Religious, it is for its necessary Relation to God.</hi> Why does he not
tell us plainly, whether this Honour the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gives
to Saints and the Virgin be Religious, or not, and in what sense
it may be called Religious Honour? If he undertake to expound
the Catholick Faith, why does he not do it? Why does he speak
so cautiously? As if he were afraid to own, what the Faith of the
Church is in this point? Which yet is a very material one, and
very necessary to be truly stated. Thus I can understand, how
the Honour, which is given to Creatures, may have Relation to
God, <hi>viz.</hi> because we honour them for God's Sake, and upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Relation to him; but I do not understand, how this
relation to God, makes the Honour of Creatures a Religious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
For though we honour Creatures for God's Sake, yet the
Honour we give to Creatures must be sutable to their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53692:18"/>
and therefore not that Religious Honour, which is proper
to God only: As when we honour a man for the sake of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or our Prince, we do not give him that Honour, which is
proper to our Father, or our Prince, though we honour him for
their Sakes. And therefore if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does give Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Honour to any Creatures, it will not justifie her, in giving
religious Honour to Creatures, that she honours them for God's
Sake; for Creatures are Creatures still, though never so nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to God, and therefore not capable of Religious Honours.</p>
               <p>So that I do not see, how this Explication, if it may be so called,
takes off any Objection, that was ever made against the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the Object of Religious Worship. For if <hi>by all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worship being terminated on God,</hi> he means, that no other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
must be religiously worshipped but only God; then this is an
invincible Objection against that Religious Worship, which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gives to the Blessed Virgin, and to Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
If he means by it, that Religious Worship may be given to
other Beings besides God, so it be all <hi>terminated</hi> in God, then all
the other Objections, against worshipping any other Being besides
God, are in full force still, notwithstanding his Explication: their
Relation to God will not justifie the Religious Worship of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and it is contrary to all Sense and Reason to say, That the
Worship, which is given to Creatures, is terminated on God.</p>

               <head type="sub">Invocation of Saints.</head>
               <p>THere are two great Opinions against that Worship, which
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gives to Saints departed, who now
reign with Christ in Heaven, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> teaches.
1. That it is to give them that Religious Worship, which is due
only to God. 2. That it makes them our Mediators and Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
in Heaven, which is an Honour peculiar to Christ. Now
<hi>M. de Meaux,</hi> and after him, the Author of the Character, think
to remove these Objections, only by explaining the Doctrine of
their Church about this matter; and I shall distinctly consider,
what they say to each of these.</p>
               <p>1. As for the first, That in praying to Saints they do not give
them that Worship, which is due only to God, they think is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53692:19"/>
from hence, That the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> and the Catechism
<hi>ad Parochos</hi> teaches them only, <hi>to pray to Saints to pray for them:</hi>
The Bishop takes great pains to prove this to be the sense of the
Council,<note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> and therefore, <hi>that in what terms soever those Prayers,
which we address to Saints, are couched, the Intention of the Church,
and of her Faithful, reduces them always to this Form.</hi> Now I will
not dispute this matter at present, but refer my Reader to the
<hi>Answer to a Papist misrepresented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But let us suppose, that this is all the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>intends by
it, that we should only pray to the Saints to pray for us, what
advantage can they make of this? Yes, says the Advertisement
before the Bishops Exposition, p.</hi> 12. To pray to Saints only to pray
for us, is a kind of Prayer, which by its own nature, is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reserved by an Independent Being to himself, it can never be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
to him; <hi>That is, we must never pray to God to pray for
us; and therefore such a Prayer is no part of that Worship, which
is due to God. And he adds,</hi> If this Form of Prayer, pray for us, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished
the trust we have in God, it would be no less condemnable to
use it to the Living than to the Dead; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not
have said so often, Brethren, pray for us: the whole Scripture is full of
Prayers of this nature.<note place="margin">Papist misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, <hi>p. 3. Ed.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus the Author of the Character, tells us.</hi>
In this he does not at all neglect coming to God, or rob him of his honour,
but directing all his Prayers up to him, and making him the ultimat Object
of all his Petitions, He only desires sometimes the just on Earth, sometimes
those in Heaven to joyn their Prayers to his, that so the number of Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners
being increased, the Petition may find better acceptance in the
sight of God: and this is not to make them Gods, but only Petitioners to
God: He having no hopes of obtaining any thing, but of God alone.</p>
               <p>This is the least that can possibly be made of that Worship, they
give to Saints, which is not reconcileable with their practice nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and if it should appear, that this (as little as it is thought
to be) is to give that Worship to Creatures, which is due to
God, they must e'en reject praying to Saints to pray for them, as
they now do, trusting in their aid and assistances, and power to
keep them.</p>
               <p>Now I only ask, whether Prayer be not an Act of Religion, and
a worship due to God? if it be not, why do they pray to God? if
it be, then they give the worship of God to Saints, when they
pray to them. For it is not so much, the matter of our Prayer, as
the nature of Prayer, which makes it an Act of Religion. We
may pray to God for those things, which men can give, <hi>viz.</hi> Food
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53692:19"/>
and Raiment, and yet these are as religious prayers, as when we
ask such things of God, as none can give but himself; and by the
same reason, though we pray to Saints only to do that for us,
which a creature can do, that is, only to pray to God for us; yet
our very praying to them is an Act of religious worship, which
is due only to God.</p>
               <p>The truth is, I am so dull, that I cannot see, what makes these
new Reformers of the Roman-Catholick Doctrine and Worship,
so shy of owning any other <hi>aid and assistance,</hi> which they expect
from the Saints, but only their Prayers for them: for this makes
no alteration at all in the nature of that worship, they pay to
them. For suppose the Saints in Heaven (who now reign with
Christ, as the Council affirms) were intrusted with the Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of men, and the care of Saints on Earth, as Cardinal <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
expresly says they are;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm.</hi> de sanct. beatit. l. 1. c. 20. &amp;c. 18.</note> might we not as lawfully pray to
them to imploy that power, God has committed to them, for our
good and happiness, as to use their interest with God for us by
their prayers? Does one exalt you more above the condition of
creatures than the other? May we not beg our Friends on Earth, to
relieve our wants and necessities, as well as to pray for us? And if
begging the prayers of our Friends on Earth, will justifie our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Saints in Heaven, to pray for us; our asking an Alms
on Earth, will equally justifie our begging the aid and assistance,
as well as prayers, of the Saints in Heav<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n; and then we are just
where we were. And if ever there were any good Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
praying to Saints, they are all good still, though they pray
to Saints only to pray for them: which is my only business at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to shew (according to the Bishop's desire) <hi>that his Explication
leaves all the Objections in full force, and all the Disputes untouched.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that setting aside the matter of our prayers, or what it is we
ask, which makes no alteration in this case, the inquiry is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when we pray to Saints, we do not give that worship to
them, which is peculiar and appropriate to God?</p>
               <p>Now the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is so far from thinking such prayers
to be the peculiar worship due to God, that she thinks it as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
to pray to the Saints in Heaven to pray for us, as it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
the prayers of our Christian Brethren on Earth. The Bishop
says, <hi>The Church in teaching us, that it is profitable to pray to Saints,
teaches us to pray to them in the same spirit of Charity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>and according to
the same order of fraternal Society, which moves us to demand assistance
of our Brethren living on Earth.</hi> The Character to the same purpose
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53692:20"/>
makes <hi>our desiring sometimes the Saints on Earth, sometimes those in
Heaven, to joyn their prayers with ours,</hi> to be Actions of the very
same nature, and equally lawful. This is the true Pinch of the
Controversie, and here it is we part with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi>
that we think, there is some difference between speaking to our
Christian Brethren on Earth, whom we see, and converse with,
and praying to the Saints in Heaven, with all the external ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of religious worship and adoration: The first is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with them as men; the second is such a manner of Address,
as is proper only for a God.</p>
               <p>To pray to Saints, is somewhat more than to desire our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Friends to pray for us; it is <hi>supplicitèr eos invocare,</hi> as the
Council of <hi>Trent</hi> speaks, to invoke them, or call on them, in the
manner of Supplicants; so that this must be acknowledged a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Saints; and then it must be either a civil or religious
worship; and which of these two it is, must be known by the
manner of paying it. And therefore when all the circumstances
of worship are religious, we must acknowledge the worship to be
religious too: Such as praying to them in religious Places, in
Churches and Chappels, and at consecrated Altars with bended
knees, and hands and eyes lifted up, in a very devout manner,
when they see no body to speak to, or to receive their Addresses,
unless it be the Image of the Saint they worship. Thus some
Nations worship their Gods, but no People ever paid their civil
respects to each other in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But as I observed in my Reply</hi> (p. 66.) There is one infallible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
between civil and religious worship, between the worship of God
and men: That the worship of the invisible Inhabitants of the other
World, has always been accounted religious worship. Civil respects are
confined to this World, as all natural and civil Relations, which are the
foundation of civil respects, are; but we have no intercourse with the
other World, but what is religious. And therefore as the different kinds
and degrees of civil honour, are distinguished by the Sight of the Object,
to which they are paid, though the external acts and expressions are the
same; as when men bow the body, and are uncovered, you know what kind
of honour it is, by seeing who is present, whether their Father, their
Friend, or their Prince, or some other Honourable Person: So the most
certain mark of distinction between civil and religious worship is this,
that the one relates to this World, the other to the invisible Inhabitants
of the next. <hi>In this last Paragraph the Protester says</hi> (p. 35.) We
have a Consequence and Comparison, and both so excellent in their kinds,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53692:20"/>
that if any better connexion can be found in them, then between the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument</hi>
and the <hi>May-pole,</hi> it must be by one, who has found one trick
more in Logick, than ever <hi>Aristotle</hi> knew. <hi>Sometimes indeed</hi> Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle<hi>'s
Logick does not do such feats, as one would expect; but a
little natural Logick, called common sense, would have shewed
him the connexion. For I think, there is some sence in saying,
that as the different degrees of civil honour, though most of the
external signs of honour be the same, such as kneeling, bowing
the body, uncovering the head, may yet be distinguished by the
presence of the Object, to which it is paid; whether it be our
Father, or our Prince: So though the external signs of civil and
religious honour, are in many instances the same, yet civil and
religious worship may be visibly distinguished, by the object to
which it is given: For civil worship can belong only to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of this World; but whatever worship is given to the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Inhabitants of the other World, is religious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if this be so, then to pray to Saints, now they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
out of this World into an invisible state, is to give reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
worship to them; which makes a vast difference between
praying to the Saints in Heaven to pray for us, and speaking to
our fellow-Christians on Earth to pray for us.</p>
               <p>The Protester is willing to grant, or at least suppose, that the
honour or worship,<note place="margin">Papists Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. <hi>p.</hi> 33.</note> which is given to the invisible Inhabitants of
the other World, is religious worship; but still he says, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
to be proved, <hi>that all religious respect and honour is so a divine
honour, as to make a God of the thing, to which it is paid, at least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structively:</hi>
This I think, is no hard matter to do; but I shall first
consider his Arguments against it, and all that he says, is, That if
it be true, <hi>it proves too much, and will bring my self in for a share</hi> with
them, in giving religious worship to creatures, and so making
Gods of them, at least constructively. He instances in that Custom
of <hi>bowing to the Altar, or Communion Table,</hi> as he calls it, and <hi>bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the name of Jesus;</hi> but this shall be considered, when I come
to the worship of Images. His other instances concern <hi>that religious
respect, which we allow due to sacred places and things, and a religious
decency to the bodies of Saints and Martyrs;</hi> but what is this to a
religious worship. The respect we shew to such things and places,
is no more than a civil respect, which consists in a decent usage,
in seperating them from vile and common purposes; and
it is called a religious respect, not from the nature of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
but from the reason, why we give it, <hi>viz.</hi> out of reverence
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53692:21"/>
to God, to whose worship they are seperated. Thus that love and
honour we pay to a living Saint, though it rise no higher than the
expressions of a civil respect, may be said to be religious, when we
love and honour them for Gods sake; but this is an external deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
from the Cause and motive, not from the nature of the
Act, and therefore cannot make Gods of them, because it is not reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
worship; but to give proper religious worship to any Being,
is to give it that worship, which is proper only to God, which is
the only way to make any Being a God, which is not a God.</p>
               <p>Now if this be a true notion, that all worship, which is given
to the invisible Inhabitants of the other World, is religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
I will easily prove, that we must worship no other invisible
Being, but God alone, and therefore cannot pray to Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
without giving the worship of God to them.</p>
               <p>And my reason is this, Because God challenges all religious
worship to himself; as our Saviour tells us, <hi>Thou shalt worship the
Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve,</hi> Matth. 4. It seems to
me a very needless dispute, what is the peculiar and incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Worship, which must be given to none but the Supreme God,
when God has appropriated all Religious Worship to himself,
whatever act of religious Worship God requires us to pay to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
must be given to none else; and therefore if all worship paid
to invisible Beings, be in its own Nature religious Worship, we
must worship no Invisible Being, but only God. For if all Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Invisible Beings be religious, and God challenges all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worship to himself, then we must worship no Invisible
Being but only God; for to worship any other Invisible Being, is
to give religious Worship to that, which is not God.</p>
               <p>But the Protester thinks I ought to have allowed, for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>Kinds and Degrees of Religious, as well as Civil Honour.</hi> Such I
suppose as they call their <hi>Latria</hi> or <hi>Dulia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 35.</note> Supreme or Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Absolute or Relative, Terminative or Transient Worship; but
there is no place for these different Degrees and Distinctions of
religious Worship, if we must worship no other Invisible Being,
but only God; for if there be but one Object of religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
there is no need to distinguish this Worship into different
Kinds and Degrees, as Civil Worship is, which has very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and very different Objects. If we must give no Worship to
any invisible Being besides God, it is ridiculous to dispute, what
Degree of Worship we may lawfully give them, when we must
give them none.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:53692:21"/>
And it is a good Argument, that there are no different Kinds of
Religious Worship; one which is Supreme and Soveraign, and due
to the one Supreme God; other Inferiour and Subordinate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Worship, which may be paid to those Excellent Spirits,
which are very dear to God, and the Ministers of his Providence;
because there are no external and visible Signs, to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
such different Degrees of religious Worship. As Civil Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is confined to the Inhabitants of this World, and is thereby
distinguished from religious Worship; so the Different Degrees
of Civil Honour, though the External Signs and Expressions of it
are the same, are distinguished by the visible Presence of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to which it is paid; for when a man bows or uncovers his
head, we know what kind of Honour it is, by considering the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
or the Quality, of the Person, to whom it is paid, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be a Father, a Prince, or a wise and good man. But if there
were more Invisible Beings than one to worship, though there
might be different Degrees of Internal Honour and Worship paid
to them, according to the different Apprehensions men had of
their several Degrees of Perfection; yet the External Signs of
Worship must be the same in all. And thus there would be no
visible distinction, between the Worship of the Supreme God, and
created Spirits, and Glorifyed Souls of dead men; and therefore
if it be necessary to distinguish, between the Worship of God and
Creatures, we must worship no Invisible Being, but only the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
God.</p>
               <p>The Protester proposes some ways, whereby <hi>the different kinds
and degrees of Religious Worship may be distinguished;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 35<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> as <hi>by the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Giver;</hi> but this is not a Visible Distinction: For mens
intentions are private to themselves, and there is no difference
in the Visible Acts of Worship, to make such a distinction, <hi>or by
some Visible Representation;</hi> that is, by Images: This I grant, would
make as visible a Distinction between the Worship of God, and
Christ, and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as the presence of the person distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes
the Kinds and Degrees of Civil Honour; for when we
see, whose Image they worship, we may certainly tell what Being
they direct their Worship to; but the fault of this is, that it is
forbid by the Law of God; of which more in the next Section; or
by <hi>Determination of other Circumstances,</hi> but what these are, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, and therefore can say nothing to it.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> indeed does appropriate the Sacrifice of
the Mass to God, as his peculiar Worship, which must not be given
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53692:22"/>
to any other Being; and if this be so, then indeed we can certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tell, when we see a Priest offering the Sacrifice of the Mass,
that he offers it to the Supreme God; but there are a great many
other Acts of Worship, which we owe to God, besides the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Mass, and in every Act of Worship, God ought to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
distinguished from Creatures; and yet if all the other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Acts of Worship be common to God, and Creatures, where
is the distinction? And yet the Sacrifice of the Mass can be offered
only by the Priest, so that the whole Layety cannot perform any
one Act of Worship to God, which is peculiar to him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can make no Visible Distinction in their Worship between
God and Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And yet the very Sacrifice of the Mass, is not so appropriated
to God in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>but that it is offered to God
in Honour of the Saints. This the Bishop of</hi> Condom <hi>(p. 7.)
endeavours to excuse by saying;</hi> This Honour which we render them
(the Saints) in Sacrificing,<note place="margin">See D. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry <hi>p.</hi> 216. &amp;c.</note> consists in naming them in the Prayers we
offer up to God, as his Faithful Servants, and in rendring him thanks
for the Victories they have gained, and in humbly beseeching him, that
he would vouchsafe to favour us by their Intercession.</p>
               <p>Now it is very true, according to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> the
Priest offers the Sacrifice only to God, but they do somewhat
more than name the Saints in their Prayers, for they offer the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
in Honour to the Saints, as well as to God, which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
calls <hi>to Honour the Memory of the Saints:</hi> Now if Sacrifice be
an Act of Honour and Worship to God, it sounds very odly to
worship or honour God for the Honour of his Saints, which
seems to make God only the Medium of Worship to the Saints,
who are the terminative object of it; and that the Saints are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in this Sacrifice appears from this, That by this Sacrifice
they <hi>implore the Intercession of the Saints,</hi> that <hi>those whose Memories
we celebrate on Earth, would vouchsafe to intercede for us in Heaven.</hi>
The Bishop translates <hi>implorat</hi> by <hi>Demand,</hi> for what reason I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell; and makes this <hi>Imploring</hi> or <hi>Beseeching,</hi> to refer to God,
not to the Saints, whose Patronage, <hi>Patrocinia,</hi> and Intercession they
pray, they would vouchsafe them, contrary to the plain Sense of the
Council, and I think to common Sense too: For I do not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
offering Sacrifice to God, that he may procure for us the
Intercession of the Saints; for if he can be perswaded to favour us
so far, as to intercede with the Saints to be our Intercessors, he
may as well grant our Requests without their Intercession; and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53692:22"/>
yet the Bishop was very sensible, that if we offer up our Prayers
to the Saints in the Sacrifice of the Mass, it does inevitably entitle
them to the Worship of that Sacrifice,<note place="margin">St. <hi>Aug.</hi> de. ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Dei <hi>p. 8. c.</hi> 27.</note> which, they say, must be
offered only to God. He alleadges indeed St. <hi>Austin's</hi> Authority,
who understood nothing of this Mystery of the Sacrifice of the
Mass, and how far he was from thinking of any thing of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is evident to any man, who consults the place.</p>
               <p>But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as the Bishop observes <hi>p. 8.)</hi> has
been charged by some of the Reformation, not only with giving
the Worship of God to Creatures, when they pray to the Saints,
but with attributing the Divine Perfections to them, such as <hi>a
certain kind of Immensity and Knowledge of the Secrets of hearts;</hi> for
if they be not present in all places, where they are worshipped,
how can they hear the Prayers, which are made to them at such
distant places at the same time? If they do not know our thoughts,
how can they understand those mental prayers, which are offered
to them without words, only in our secret Thoughts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires?
for even such Prayers are expresly allowed by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<hi>voce vel mente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to this he answers very well, that though they believe
the Saints do by one means or other know the Prayers, which are
made to them, either <hi>by the Ministry and Communication of Angels,
or by a particular Revelation from God, or in his Divine Essence, in
which all truth is comprised, yet never any Catholick yet thought, the
Saints knew our Necessities by their own power, no nor the desires which
move us to address our secret Prayers to them. And to say a Creature
may have a Knowledge of these things, by a light communicated to them
by God, is not to elevate a Creature above his Condition.</hi> This I
grant and therefore do acknowledge, that they do not attribute
the Divine perfections of Omniscience and Omnipresence to the
Saints, either in thought or word, but yet actions have as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
a signification as words; and if we give them such a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
as naturally signifies Omniscience and Omnipresence, our
worship attributes the incommunicable Perfections of God to
them. For it is unnatural and absurd to worship a Being, who is
not present to receive our worship; to speak to a Being, who
does not, and cannot hear us; and since God has made us reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Creatures, to understand what we do, and why, he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
our Actions, as well as words and thoughts, according to
their natural signification. And herein the natural evil of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-worship
consists, That every act of religious worship does
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53692:23"/>
naturally involve in it a Confession of some excellency and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
which is above a created nature, and thereby (whatever
the worshipper thinks or intend) does attribute the incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable
Glory of God to creatures.</p>
               <p>If the Saints are not present in all places to hear those Prayers
which are made to them, and if they cannot hear in Heaven, what
we say to them on Earth, <hi>by their own Power,</hi> then Prayer is a
worship, which is not due to their nature, even in a glorified
state. For no Being can have a right to our Prayers, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hear them; and though we should grant, that God reveals
our Prayers to them, yet to know by Revelation is not to hear.
In this case all that can be reasonable for us to do, is only secretly
to desire, that the Saints would Pray for us, which God can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal
to them, if he pleases, as well as our Prayers; but it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be reasonable to Pray to those, who cannot hear us.</p>
               <p>And if Prayer cannot be due to a created nature in its most
exalted state, because no creature can be present in all places to
hear our Prayers, then if it be a proper worship for Creatures,
it must be so by a positive Institution of God; but then they
must shew an express command for it, and when they can do that,
we will dispute the reason of the thing no longer.</p>
               <p>And this is a manifest reason, why we should worship no other
invisible Being besides God, because no other invisible Being is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of our Worship. God alone fills all places, and therefore
may be worshipped, though we do not see him, for he is present
every where to hear our prayers; but we cannot know, that any
Being, of a limited presence, is present with us, unless we see it;
and it is unnatural to pray to any Being, who is not present to
hear us.</p>
               <p>And though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not directly and positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attribute any divine perfections to Saints, yet mankind are so
naturally prone, to ascribe a kind of Divinity to immortal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Spirits, that this is a sufficient reason, why God should
not allow the worship of any invisible Spirits. For after all that
can be said to the contrary, it is a mighty temptation to men, at
least to make inferior Deities of those, to whom they constantly
pay divine honours.</p>
               <p>And though they do not attribute to Saints, a natural power to
know our Thoughts, and to hear our Prayers, and to answer
them: yet if this supernatural gift and power, whereby they do
it, be as constant, and act as certainly as nature does, it is as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53692:23"/>
great and adorable a perfection, as if it were natural: for since all
created Excellencies are the gift of God, what mighty difference
is there between a natural and supernatural perfection, or gift, if
that which is supernatural, be as certain and lasting, and that
which they can as constantly use, as that which is natural. As to
take their own instance: Were the gift of Prophesie, which God
bestowed on some in former Ages, as constant and certain, as
natural knowledge; that they could use this gift, whenever they
pleased, and as constantly foretel things to come, as they could
reason and discourse; what difference would there be in this
case, between a natural and supernatural knowledge of future
things: truly no more but this; That a natural knowledge is
a perfection, which God did originally bestow upon our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
supernatural knowledge is an additional Perfection, but
yet upon this supposition, as inseparably annexed to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as natural knowledge, and always as ready for use as that;
which I think, would make such a Prophet as truly venerable, as
if Prophesie were natural to him.</p>
               <p>Thus it is in this present case. If the Saints know our prayers,
by what means soever they do it, it must be as constant and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a gift, as if it were natural; that is, they must as certainly
know when, and what we pray for, every time we pray, as if
they were present to hear us. For if they do not always know
our prayers, we can never know, when to pray, and can never
have any security of their Intercession for us; many thousand
<hi>Ave Maries</hi> may be every day lost, and turn to no account; and if
they do constantly know this by a supernatural gift, it is as glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a perfection, as if this knowledge were natural. Mankind
do not so critically distinguish between natural and supernatural
gifts; in whomsoever these perfections are, they are divine, and
such creatures have a supernatural kind of Divinity annexed to
their natures; they are made Gods, though not Gods by nature,
which is as much as any people believe of their inferior Deities,
who believe but one Supreme and Sovereign God, who is a God
by nature.</p>
               <p>And yet the Author of the Character of <hi>a Papist represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
gives some instances, which would perswade us, that the
Saints have a natural knowledge of our Prayers. Thus he
tells us, <hi>That</hi> Abraham <hi>heard the petitions of</hi> Dives, <hi>who was yet
at a greater distance, even in Hell, and told him likewise his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of living, while as yet on Earth,</hi> (p. 4.) Now not to ask, how
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53692:24"/>
he comes so exactly to know, where Hell is, and that it is at
a greater distance from Heaven, than the Earth is: If there
be any force in this Argument, it must prove, that the Saints
have a natural knowledge of our Prayers, though at so great a
distance from us, as Heaven is: That they see, and hear us, as
<hi>Abraham</hi> did <hi>Dives,</hi> though we cannot see and hear them, as <hi>Dives</hi>
did <hi>Abraham;</hi> which might have satisfied him, since he thinks fit
to reason from Parables, that whatsoever distance there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Heaven and Hell, there is a greater communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, than between Heaven and Earth. However our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
cannot here speak of any supernatural gift, whereby <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
saw and heard <hi>Dives</hi> in Hell; unless we will say, that <hi>Dives</hi>
did by a supernatural gift also, see and hear <hi>Abraham</hi> in Heaven;
and therefore if this prove any thing, it proves, that Saints
know and hear our Prayers by their own natural powers.</p>
               <p>Thus he adds, <hi>That the very Devils hear those desperate wretches,
who call on them; and why then should he doubt, that Saints want this
priviledge in some manner granted to sinful men and wicked spirits.</hi>
But though he call this a Priviledge, I suppose, he means a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
one, unless he thinks, that the Devils hear witches by a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
revelation, as the Saints in Heaven hear the prayers of the
Saints on Earth: But I always thought, that Devils had been a
little nearer bad men, than the Saints in Heaven are to us on
Earth; for they are confined to this Lower Region, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are often so near, as to see and hear bad men, though they are
invisible themselves: And this is one reason, why God will not
allow us to worship any invisible Spirits, because though we
should intend only to worship good Spirits, and glorified Saints,
yet bad Spirits, who are near and present, as having their resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the Air, as the Devil is called the Prince of the Power
of the Air, do assume this worship to themselves, and both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the worship, and abuse their Votaries, with lying Wonders.
Thus they did in the times of Paganism, and whether they have
more reverence for the Christian Saints, than they had for the
Pagan Deities, in assuming their names and worship, let others
consider.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Bishop. He having assured us, that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does not ascribe any divine perfections to the
Saints (of which the Reader may judge by what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
discoursed) he thus concludes. <hi>It is therefore true, that by
examining what are our interiour Sentiments concerning the Saints, it
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53692:24"/>
will be found we do not raise them above the condition of creatures,<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note>
and from thence we ought to judge, of what nature that exteriour honour
is, which we render them; exteriour Veneration being established to
testifie the interior Sentiments of the mind:</hi> That is, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
they do not give the worship of God to them, because
they do not believe them to be Gods. Now this, I confess, would
be true, were the external Signs of honour wholly arbitrary, and
at our own choice; for then they could signifie no more, than
what we intend to signifie by them, and we ought not to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with intending to signifie more, than what we profess to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend;
but when either the Act of worship naturally signifies di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
perfections, as prayer to an Invisible Being does, or God has
reserved any Acts of worship to himself, as he has done all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worship, that is, all Worship paid to Invisible Beings, as
I have already shewn; in these cases we may be guilty of giving
divine honours to creatures, though in words and intention, we
ascribe no divine perfections to them.</p>
               <p>So that I cannot see, but that, after all the fine colours, and soft
interpretations, which the Bishop puts upon this practice of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in praying to Saints, the charge against them of
giving the peculiar worship of God to creatures, is as strong and
forcible as ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, let us now consider, whether our praying to the
Saints, to pray and intercede for us, be not injurious to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and Mediation of Christ. Now there are two things the
Bishop urges to prove, that the Mediation of Saints is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
to the Mediation of Christ.</hi> 1. That if the quality of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,<note place="margin">Pag. 6.</note>
which the Scriptures gives to Jesus Christ, received any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
from the Intercession made to the Saints<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who raign with God, it
would receive no less from the intercession made to the Faithful who
live with us.<note place="margin">Nam si prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terea Subsidiis sanctorum uti non liceat, quod unum patronum ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bemus Jesum Christum, nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam id com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misisset Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolus, ut se Deo tanto studio fratrum viventium precibus adjuvari vellet; ne<expan>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>For this he alledges the Authority of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism</hi>
ad Parochos, <hi>which tells us,</hi> That if it were not lawful
to desire help of the Saints, because we have one Patron or Mediator
Jesus Christ, the Apostle would not so earnestly have desired the
Prayers of the Brethren, who were then living, to God for him. For
the glory and dignity of Christ, as Mediator, is not less diminished
by the Prayers of the Living, than by the Intercession of Saints in
Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:53692:25"/>
This is the least that can be made of it, that the Mediation and
Intercession of the Saints for us in Heaven, is no more than one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
praying for another on Earth; and I fear this is not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
with the practice of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this matter.
For can this (if it be no more) be thought a sufficient foundation,
for all that pompous worship of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other
powerful Saints? Is this a good reason to erect Temples and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
consecrated not only to their Memory, but to their Honour;
to set up their Images in Holy Places, and pay our humble Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
before them; because they pray for us in Heaven, just as
Christian Brethren pray for one another on Earth?</p>
               <p>And therefore I must needs say, the Bishop has not truly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Point, which
makes the Saints to be <hi>our Mediators in Heaven;</hi> not indeed Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of Redemption, which she acknowledges none to be but
Christ, who has purchased us with his own Blood; but Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of Intercession, who have so much interest, and favour, in the
Court of Heaven, as powerfully to recommend those to God,
who put themselves under their Patronage. This I confess makes
a great difference between the Mediation of Christ, and of the
Saints, and yet leaves a great distance between the Prayers of
Saints in Heaven for us, and the mutual Intercessions of Christians
for each other on Earth, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> never taught,
that they were of the same nature; for though the Catechism
endeavours to prove, that the Mediation and Intercession of the
Saints in Heaven for us, is not injurious to the Mediation of
Christ; because the Prayers of Christians for each other on Earth,
are very reconcileable with the Honour of Christ's Intercession:
yet it never teaches, that there is no difference between the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Saints in Heaven, and Christians on Earth; and I think we
ought to distinguish, between the Doctrine and the Arguments of
the Church. What she declares to be her Doctrine we must own
to be so, but I think we must not grant every thing to be her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes
which ought to be supposed to make her Arguments good;
because there is no necessity of granting, that all her Arguments
must be good.</p>
               <p>This Argument indeed, that the intercession of the Saints in
Heaven, is no more injurious to the Mediation of Christ, than
the Prayers and Intercessions of the Saints on Earth for each
other, cannot be good without supposing, that the Intercessions of
the Saints in Heaven are of the very same nature, with the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53692:25"/>
of Christians for each other on Earth; and the Bishop takes
the advantage to represent this as the Doctrine of the Church,
that <hi>she teaches us to pray to Saints in the same spirit of Charity, and
according to the same order of fraternal society, which moves us to
demand assistance of our Brethren living upon Earth.</hi> But this I think
is not reconcileable with the express words of the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> which founds the invocation of Saints upon their <hi>reigning
with Christ;</hi> which makes a vast difference between their interest
and authority in the Court of Heaven, and the humble suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of Christians on Earth. And I think <hi>the spirit of Charity,
and the order of fraternal society,</hi> does not require us <hi>supplicitèr in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocare,</hi>
to pray to our fellow Christians on Earth <hi>as humble Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants</hi>
to pray for us, as the Council teaches us to address our
selves to the Saints in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Christians indeed on Earth, and Saints in Heaven (since the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
has limited all their aid and assistance to their prayers) can
do no more than pray for us; and are thus both of them distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Christ, who is our Mediator of Redemption, who has
bought us with his blood: But then we ought to consider, that
there is a vast difference in prayers, and prayers may prevail
upon such different Reasons, as may quite alter the nature of the
Intercessions. For is there no difference between the power and
interest of a favourite, to obtain what he desires of his Prince, and
the Petition of an ordinary Subject? A Prince may grant the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Subject for himself, or of one Subject for another, where
there is reason and equity in the case, without any more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
intercession; but acts of grace and favour must be dispensed
by the intercession of favourites; and yet it is all by way of
prayer and Petition to the Prince; but though it is all but Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and request, yet those who have any request to make to their
Prince, place more confidence in the interest and power of one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite,
than in the joynt Petitions of many ordinary Subjects.</p>
               <p>Thus it is here; Christians on Earth pray for each other as
common Supplicants, and the benefit they expect from such
Prayers and Intercessions, is only from the prevalency of Faith and
Charity, which inspire such prayers, and make them efficacious.
God has commanded us to pray for one another, and has promised
to hear our united, fervent, and importunate Prayers, for the
merits of our common Saviour Jesus Christ: But those who pray
to Saints in Heaven, pray to them as Favourites and Mediators,
who prevail not meerly by the force and efficacy of Prayer, but
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53692:26"/>
by their personal Merits and Interests with God; and this makes
them just such Mediators as Christ is, who by their Power and
Interest can recommend us and our Prayers to God's acceptance.
No you'll say, Christ purchased us with his Blood, and mediates
in the vertue of his Sacrifice, which makes his Mediation of a
different nature from the Mediation of Saints, who mediate only
by their interest with God, upon account of their personal Merits.
But this alters not the case; for the general notion of a Mediator,
is one who has Power and Interest with God, effectually to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
us to his favour; and whether he mediates with, or
without a Sacrifice, if his Mediation be powerful and efficacious,
he is a true and proper Mediator; and to set up such other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators
besides Christ, must be injurious to his Mediation, for then
Christ is not our only Mediator; and after all the Apologies that
can be made for it, it argues some distrust, either of Christ's Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
or good Will to help us, when we fly to other Patrons and
Advocates.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>And therefore</hi> Monsieur de Meaux <hi>has another Reserve; for
in the second place he tells us from the Council of</hi> Trent, That to
invocate Saints, according to the sense of this Council, is to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se
to their Prayers, for obtaining benefits from God through Jesus
Christ, so that in reality we do not obtain those benefits, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
by the Intercession of the Saints, otherwise than through Jesus
Christ, and in his Name; seeing these Saints themselves pray in no other
manner than through Jesus Christ, and are not heard but in his Name.
After which we cannot imagine, that any one should accuse us of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
Jesus Christ, when we beseech his Members, who are also ours,
his Children, who are our Brethren, and his Saints, who are our first
fruits, to pray with us, and for us, to our common Master, in the
name of our common Mediator.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>forsaking Jesus Christ,</hi> this we do not charge them with;
tho whoever considers, how much more frequent addresses are
made in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and some other
powerful Saints, than to Christ himself, will be tempted to
think, that it looks very like forsaking him; but we only say,
that they rob Christ of the glory of being our only Mediator and
Advocate, by having recourse to the Prayers, and intercessions of
so many Saints.</p>
               <p>But how can the Intercession of Saints be injurious to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of Christ, when they themselves intercede in the Name
and Mediation of Christ; which necessarily reserves to Christ
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53692:26"/>
the glory of his Mediation entire, since the Saints themselves <hi>are
not heard but in his Name?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now rightly to understand this, we must consider the Nature
of Christs Mediation, which is to offer up all those Prayers to
God in Heaven, which we make to God in his name on Earth. He
is our Mediator in Heaven,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>our High-Priest, who is passed into the
Heavens;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 16. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>who is made not after the law of a Carnal Commandment, but
after the power of an endless life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>who is made higher than the Heavens,
who is not entred into the Holy Place made with hands, which are the
figures of the true, but into Heaven it self, now to appear in the presence
of God for us.</hi> So that as the High-Priest under the Law entred
once a year into the Holy Place, which was a type and figure of
Heaven, to make expiation and intercessions for the People; so
the Office of Christ, as our High-Priest and Mediator, is to ascend
into Heaven with his own Blood, and there to appear in the
presence of God for us. His mediatory Office is confined to
Heaven; there he presents our Prayers to God, in vertue of his
own Blood; and this is as peculiar and appropriated to him, as it
was to the High-Priest under the Law, to offer the Blood of the
Sacrifice, and make Attonement, and Intercession in the Holy of
Holies.</p>
               <p>So that to present our Prayers to God in Heaven is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
office of Christ, who is our great High-Priest, and only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
in the immediate presence of God in Heaven; and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
our selves to any other Mediators in Heaven, to present our
Prayers to God, in what manner, or upon what pretence soever
it be, is injurious to the Mediation of Christ, whose proper Office
it is to present our Prayers to God in Heaven. And that pretence
that the Saints pray for us only in the Name and Mediation of
Christ, is no Apology in this case, for in what name soever they
pray, they offer up our Prayers to God immediately in Heaven,
which is the Office of our great High-Priest, for there is and must
be but be but one Mediator in Heaven.</p>
               <p>And if we consider, what is meant by Praying to God in the
Name and Mediation of Christ, we shall see reason to think, that
this is very improperly attributed to the Saints in Heaven. For
when we pray to God in the Name of Christ, though we address
our Prayers immediately to God, yet God does not receive them,
as coming immediately from us, but as presented by the hands of
our Mediator; which is the true meaning of Praying to God in
the Name of Christ, that we offer our Prayers to God, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53692:27"/>
from our selves, for then we should have no need of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
but by his Hands, whose Office it is to present them to
God, to appear in the Presence of God for us, which is therefore
called <hi>coming to God by him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now this is very agreeable to the state and condition of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
on Earth, who are at a great distance from the immediate
Throne and Presence of God, to offer their Prayers by the hands
of a Mediator, who appears in the presence of God for them;
and the reason, why we want a Mediator to appear for us, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are not yet admitted into God's immediate Presence our
selves. But could every ordinary Priest, or <hi>Jew,</hi> have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the Holy of Holies, as the High-Priest was, they might
as well have offered their Prayers and Sacrifices there immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to God, without the Ministry and Mediation of the High-Priest;
and those who are in Heaven in the immediate presence of God, if
they offer up any Prayers to God for themselves or others, they
offer them immediately and directly to God, because they offer
them to God in his immediate Presence; which is the true notion
of Christ's Mediation, that he appears in the presence of God for
us: And therefore whatever use there may be of the Name of
Christ in Heaven; Saints in Heaven, who live in the immediate
Presence of God, have no need of a Mediator to offer their Prayers
to God, as Saints on Earth have, because they are admitted to
the immediate Vision of God themselves. To offer up our Prayers
to God, in the Name and Mediation of Christ, supposes, that we
are at a distance from God, and not admitted into his Presence to
speak for our selves; but those Prayers, which are offered to God
in his immediate Presence, need no Mediator to present them.
And yet to say, that the Saints in Heaven offer their Prayers to
God in the Name and Mediation of Christ, is to say, that when
they are admitted to the immediate Presence of God themselves,
they still need a Mediator; that the Prayers they offer to God, in
his immediate Presence, they do not offer immediately to him, but
by the hands of a Mediator; which if it be Sence, I am sure, is
no good Divinity, as neither agreeing with the Types of the
Law, nor with the Gospel-account of Christ's Mediation. And
therefore if glorified Saints appear for us in the presence of God
in Heaven, they are as much our Mediators as Christ is; for this
is the most essential Character of this Mediation, that <hi>he appears
in the presence of God for us.</hi> The only Objection I can fore-see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this, is, that some of the ancient Fathers, though they did
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:53692:27"/>
not pray to Saints to pray for them, yet were inclined to believe,
that Saints departed did Pray for the Church on Earth, especially
for their particular Friends, which they left behind them, and
therefore to be sure did not think this any injury to the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ. But then we must consider, that as they spoke
doubtfully of this matter, so those very Fathers did not believe,
that Saints departed were received up into the highest Heaven,
into the immediate Presence and Throne of God; though they
thought them in a very happy state, yet not perfect, till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection;
and therefore they prayed for Saints departed, as
well as believed, that Saints departed prayed for them. Now
any Mediation and Intercession on this side Heaven, is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the Mediation of Christ in Heaven; but to intercede
in Heaven is his peculiar Office, which no other Creature can
share in, since his Resurrection and Ascension. This, I think, is
sufficient to prove, that <hi>Monsieur de Meaux</hi> his Exposition cannot
reconcile <hi>Praying to Saints to Pray for us,</hi> either with the peculiar
Worship of God, or with the Glory and Dignity of our great and
only Mediator <hi>and Advocate Jesus Christ.</hi>

bare <hi>Ora pro nobis;</hi> but the Representer, who pretends to follow
the Bishops Pattern, but wants his Judgment and Caution to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it, undertakes to Apologize for this too; and it is worth
the while to consider what he says.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Papist Mis-represented is said</hi> to believe the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to
be much more powerful in Heaven than Christ, and that she can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him to do, what she thinks good, and for this reason he Honours
her, much more then he does her Son, or God the Father, for one Prayer
he says to God, saying ten to the Holy Virgin. <hi>Let us then consider
how much of Mis-representation there is in this; and I shall begin
with the last first, because mens Actions are the best Interpreters
of their Thoughts and Belief.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Papist <hi>for one prayer he says to God, says ten to the Virgin</hi>
Mary: Is this mis-represented? Let him but tell over his Beads<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:53692:28"/>
and see how many <hi>Ave Maries</hi> and <hi>Pater nosters</hi> he will find upon
a string, which are exactly ten for one. This he confesses, and
thinks it as innocent to recite the Angelical Salutation now, as
it was for the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to do it. But did the
Angel use it as a Prayer to the Virgin <hi>Mary? Is Hail thou that art
Highly favoured, the Lord is with Thee, blessed art thou amongst
Women,</hi> when spoken to the Virgin, who was then present to hear
it, a friendly Saluation, or a Prayer? Was it delivering a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
or an act of Devotion? Or is this the <hi>Ave Maria</hi> now in use
in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> As I remember, there are two or three
little words,<note place="margin">Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the life and Glory of holy <hi>Mary p.</hi> 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Ora pro nobis,</hi> added to it, which make it a Prayer,
not the Angelical Salutation: And we do not read, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
said, <hi>Holy</hi> Mary, <hi>Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and in
the hour of Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed were it lawful to pray to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> I should
have less to say against the frequent repetition of this prayer;
but yet a man might enquire, why the prayer to the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> is repeated so much oftner than the prayer to God; is
not this <hi>to honour her much more then he does her Son, or God the
Father?</hi> For is not Prayer an act of Honour and Worship? And
do we not then honour that Being most, to whom we pray of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenest?
No, says the Representer, for he does not <hi>at any time say
even so much as one Prayer to her, but what is directed more principally
to God.</hi> Surely there must be some Mystery in this. For do they
not say a great many Prayers, immediately directed to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<hi>Mary,</hi> and not at all directed to God? Is not their <hi>Ave
Maria</hi> such a Prayer, and do they <hi>principally</hi> pray to God in those
Prayers, which are immediately directed to the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi>
When they pray to the Virgin <hi>Mary to pray to them,</hi> is this
Prayer <hi>princ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>pally</hi> directed to God Almighty? What when the
Virgin is only named; And the matter of the Prayer is such, that
it cannot be directed to God Almighty, unless they think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to pray to God to pray for them? Yes, these Prayers to the
Virgin are <hi>offered up as a thankful Memorial of Christ's Incarnation,
and an acknowledgement of the Blessedness of Jesus the fruit of her
Womb.</hi> The meaning of which can be no more than this, That
when they Pray to <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of Jesus, it is a tacite ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement,
that Jesus was born of her, and that the Son
must be a very Glorious Prince, when the Mother is so highly
exalted upon account of her Relation to him, as to have so many
devout Prayers and Hymns offered up to her. But does this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53692:28"/>
prove, that the Prayers, which are immediately directed to the
Virgin Mary, are <hi>principally directed</hi> to Christ, because <hi>Mary</hi> was
his Mot<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>, which is the whole Mystery of the business. Suppose
Christ should think himself honoured by those Prayers, which are
offered to his Mother, yet is there no difference between praying
to Christ, and that Honour we do him in praying to his Mother?
A late Author indeed tells us,<note place="margin">Ibid p. 5.</note> that the <hi>Veneration, which we give
to</hi> Mary, <hi>redounds to Jesus: All Honour given to the Mother, tending
to the Glory of the Son; for as he communicates with her in Flesh and
Blood; so also doth he partake with her in her Qualities and Perfections,
and therefore he is a sharer in that Homage and Observance, that is
made to her.</hi> This is a new sort of Consubstantiation, and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of Properties; but yet how much soever we honour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
when we pray to <hi>Mary,</hi> yet we do not pray to Jesus, when
we pray to <hi>Mary;</hi> and therefore these Prayers are principally and
immediately directed to <hi>Mary,</hi> not to God or Christ; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to offer ten Prayers to <hi>Mary,</hi> for one to God, look very
like <hi>honouring</hi> Mary <hi>much more than her Son, or God the Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Well, but <hi>she is the Mother of God, and Blessed amongst Women;</hi>
but how does her being Christs Mother entitle her to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
share in our Prayers and Devotions than Christ himself? It is
indeed a great Honour to her to be the Mother of Jesus, but does
this entitle her to that Worship and Homage, which is due to her
Son? She is the happiest Mother among Women, but does this
advance her above Angels and Arch-Angels? For my part I see
no reason to think, that her bearing Christ in her Womb, which
was a singular Favour conferred on her, but has nothing of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in it, should advance her above the most Eminent Apostles and
Martyrs, who with undaunted Courage and unwearied Industry
propagated the Gospel throughout the World, and were the
great Ministers of his Kingdom: I am sure our Saviour does not
seem to attribute any such mighty Vertue to the Maternity of
<hi>Mary,</hi> when a certain Woman said unto him, <hi>Blessed is the Womb
that bare thee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 11. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Paps which thou hast sucked;</hi> he answered, <hi>yea
rather Blessed are they,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 12. 46. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>who hear the Word of God and keep it.</hi> And
in another place, when some told him, <hi>behold thy Mother and thy
Brethren stand without desiring to speak with thee, he answered and said
unto him, that told him, who is my Mother? And who are my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?
and he stretched forth his hand towards his Disciples, saying,
behold my Mother and my Brethren, for whosever shall do the Will of
my Father, which is in Heaven, the same is my Mother, and Sister,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53692:29"/>
and Brother.</hi> Which prefers his meanest Disciples before the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of his Flesh, considered only as his Mother; which he would
not have done, had the bare Maternity of <hi>Mary</hi> advanced her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all other Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Well, but <hi>she is most acceptable to God in her Intercession for us.</hi>
Did the Angel tell them this too, as well as that she is Blessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Women? Whence then do they learn it? Is it only because
she is a Mother? Have all Mothers then such a natural Authority
over their Sons, even when they are Soveraign Princes? Cannot
the Eternal Son of God chuse an Earthly Mother, but he must
admit her into the Throne with him, and govern his Kingdom, if
not by her Commands, yet by her Importunities and Requests?
This is thought a great weakness in Earthly Princes, and usually
proves fatal to their Government; and yet it is much more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in Earth than in Heaven. What has the Mother of his Flesh
to do, to intermeddle in the affairs of his Spiritual Kingdom, which
she is not capable of managing? She had no Authority in the
Church, while she was on Earth, which methinks her Maternity
might give her as much Right to, as to be Queen-Regent of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
When Christ was a Child he lived in Subjection to <hi>Mary</hi> and
<hi>Joseph,</hi> though he began early to give them a Specimen of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
Power he had, and such a work to do, as discharged him
from Subjection to Earthly Parents. When he was but twelve
years old,<note place="margin">Luke 2. 48. 49.</note> he told his Mother, <hi>how was it, that ye sought me, wist
ye not that I must be about my Fathers business?</hi> When his Mother at
the Marriage in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee</hi> acquainted him, that their Wine
was spent, and insinuated her desire, that he should help them,
he rebukes her for it, <hi>Woman what have I to do with thee? my
hour is not yet come.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 2. 3, 4.</note> She was not to direct him, what to do in
such matters; and can we think then, that now he is advanced
to the Right Hand of God, he will suffer her to intermeddle in
the administration of his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>But our Author <hi>believes it damnable, to think the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>more
powerful in Heaven than Christ, or that she can in any thing command
him.</hi> It is well the <hi>Impera Redemptori, command the Redeemer,</hi> is
at last disowned by them, though it may be some may think it
a little too much to call it <hi>damnable;</hi> because whatever Papists
believe now, there was a time, when this was used in the Missals
of the Roman Church; and will he say, that it was damnable
then to use that Hymn?</p>
                  <p>I believe no Papist ever thought the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be-Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53692:29"/>
much less, that she can do more than Christ can, or can
command him by a direct and Superior Authority; nor did
any man, that I know of, ever charge them with this: and if it
be only in this sense, that he denies the Virgin to be more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in Heaven than Christ, it is nothing to the purpose; for it is
possible for a Subject to be more powerful than his Prince,
though he cannot command him, and can do nothing but by his
Princes favour; but if he have so much the ascendant of his Prince,
that he can deny him nothing, that he does whatever he will
have him, and such things as no other consideration should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
him to do, but the desire of such a powerful Favourite; this
man is really more powerful than the Prince, because he has
the direction and Government of the Princes Power: He has the
Prince himself in his Power, and therefore is more powerful
than he. And if this be the case of the Blessed Virgin, that she
has the Disposal of Christ's Grace and Mercy, though not by a
direct Authority, yet by her Interest in her Son, if he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that which she asks, but grants that at her Intercession,
which he would not grant without it; if the Papists believe
this, they believe her to be more Powerful than Christ, and
they have then good reason, as they do, to put up more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Prayers to her, than to God or Christ himself. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they do not believe this, and that at this very day, let any

who is not devoted to <hi>Mary,</hi> nor hath any one been specially
confident of the Patronage of <hi>Mary,</hi> who hath not through
her received a special Blessing from Jesus. Whence it is one
great mark of the Predestination of the Elect, to be singularly
Devoted to <hi>Mary,</hi> since she hath a full Power, as a Mother, to
obtain of Jesus, whatever he can ask of God the Father, and
is comprehended within the Sphere of man's Predestination to
Glory, Redemption from Sin, and Regeneration by Grace. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the greatest of our inward Conflicts with Sensuality,
and outward Tribulations from the adverse Casualties of
this Life; through a strong Judgment of her eminent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
within the Empire of Jesus, grounded upon the singular
Prerogative of her Divine Maternity; for by vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
no State of man can be so unhappy, through the malice
of Satan, the heats of our Passions, or the Enormity of Sin,
which exceeds her Love towards the Disciples of Jesus, or
the efficacy of her Mediation for us unto Jesus: So that
though the condition of some great Sinners may be so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable,
that all the limited Excellency, Merits and Power
of all the Saints and Angels, cannot effectually bend the
Mercies of Jesus to receive them, yet such is the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness
of the Mother of Jesus to Jesus, that whoever is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Verge of her Protection, may confide in her Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
to Jesus. He denying no Favour to her, whereby
the Wonders of man's Predestination and Redemption
through Jesus, may be magnified and promoted.</q> So that
the Blessed Virgin is more Powerful than all the Saints and
Angels in Heaven; she has all the <hi>Power</hi> of Christ, all his
Grace and Mercy in her hands, and can dispense it to such
Sinners, whom Christ would not pity and relieve without
her, and therefore is a more powerful Patroness of Sinners,
than Christ himself is. And therefore he might well add in
the next place, that all these <hi>Blessings flow from Jesus to all
through</hi> Mary, <hi>and may therefore justly refer them all to her, as to
the most effectual Instrument, Channel, and Conveyance of all.</hi> Now
if this be true Representing, it is no Mis-representation to say,
that a Papist believes the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to be much more Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in Heaven than Christ; not that she has any Power of her
own, but that she can more powerfully and <hi>effectually bend the
Mercies of Jesus to relieve Sinners, than the mercies of Jesus can
bend themselves without her.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>THAT the Worship of Images, as it was practised by
the Heathens, is Idolatry, Monsieur</hi> de Meaux <hi>and
the Representer suppose; and therefore their Business is,
to give such an account of the Worship of Images, as pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>as to distinguish themselves
from Heathen Idolaters. To this purpose the Bishop tells
us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> forbids us expresly to believe any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
or Virtue in them, for which they ought to be reverenced, to
demand any favour of them, or to put any trust in them; and
ordains, That all the Honour which is given to them, should be
referred to the Saints themselves which are represented by them.
That the Honour we render Images, is grounded upon their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
in us the remembrance of those they represent. That by
humbling our selves before the Image of Christ crucified, we show
what is our submission to our Saviour. So that to speak precisely,
and according to the Ecclesiastical Stile, when we honour the Image
of an Apostle or Martyr, our intention is not so much to honour
the Image, as to honour the Apostle or Martyr in the presence of
the Image. Thus the Pontifical tells us, and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
expresses the same thing, when it says, The Honour we render to
Images, has such a reference to those they represent, that by the
means of those Images which we kiss, and before which we kneel,
we adore Jesus Christ, and honour the Saints, whose Types they
are. <hi>To the same purpose the Representer speaks, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in the same words. So that the Sum of their Apology
is this, That they do not believe Images to have any Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in them, or to be Gods, and therefore do not pray
to, nor put their trust in the Image, nor so much honour
the Image in those external Expressions of Reverence they
pay to it, by kissing it, and kneeling before it, as Christ,
or the Saint whom the Image represents; and the usefulness
of Images to excite in us the remembrance of those whom
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53692:31"/>
we love and honour, is a justifiable Reason of that Honour
we pay to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a Matter of very great consequence, and deserves
to be carefully stated; and therefore I shall strictly examine,
Whether this Exposition will justify the worship of Images,
and sufficiently distinguish the Worship of the Ch. of <hi>Rome,</hi>
from that Worship which the Heathens gave to their Images.</p>
               <p>Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> pretends, by his Exposition of the
Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to cut off Objections and
Disputes; that is, so to state the Matter, that there may be
no place for those Objections which Protestants commonly
urge against worshipping Images. But I do not see, that he
has made any Essay of this Nature in the Point of Image-Worship,
but has left both all the Disputes among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and with Protestants, untouched.</p>
               <p>The Objections which Protestants urge against the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Images, as taught and practised in the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> are principally these four.</p>
               <p>1. That it is expresly forbid by the second Commandment,
without any limitation or exception.</p>
               <p>2. That the Heathens are in Scripture charged with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
in the Worship of Images.</p>
               <p>3. That it is a violation of the Divine Majesty, <hi>crimen
lesse Majestatis,</hi> to represent God by a material and sensless
Image or Picture.</p>
               <p>4. That a visible Object of Worship, though considered
only as a Representation, is expresly contrary to the Law of
<hi>Moses,</hi> and especially to the spiritual Nature of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Worship.</p>
               <p>Now I do not see, how the Bishop's Exposition takes off
any of these Objections, which after all that he hath said,
are in full force still, as I shall particularly shew.</p>
               <p>1. Then he tells us, <hi>That the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>forbids us
expresly to believe any Divinity or Virtue in Images, for which
they ought to be reverenced.</hi> We grant, the Council does
forbid this; and he knows that we never charge them with
it; though there are some practices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which look very suspiciously that way: but then we say,
the second Commandment forbids the worship of all Images,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53692:31"/>
without any such limitation; for there is not any one word
in the Commandment to limit the Prohibition of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Images, to such Images, as are believ'd to have any Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in them The words of the Commandment are as general
as can be, <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self any Graven Image, nor
the likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or in the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
or in the Water under the Earth; thou shalt not how down
to them, nor worship them.</hi> The Commandment takes no notice
of any Divinity which is supposed to be in these Images, but
only of the Representation made by them, that they are the
Likeness or Representation of things in Heaven, or things on
Earth, or things under the Earth; and therefore the whole
Dispute between Papists and Protestants about the sense of
the second Commandment, and the strict notion of an Idol,
is left untouch'd by this Exposition.</p>
               <p>The Roman Doctors indeed tell us, that the Heathens wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
their Images as Gods, and did ascribe Divinity to
them;<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> upon which account Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> tells us, <hi>All
these words of the Council are like so many Characters to distinguish
us from Idolaters;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>p.</hi> 466, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>seeing we are so far from believing with them
any Divinity annexed to the Images, that we do not attribute to
them any Virtue, but that of exciting in us the remembrance of
those they represent.</hi> But he knew very well, that Protestants
deny, that the Heathens took their Images for Gods any
more than Papists do; their Philosophers despised the charge,
and made the same Apologies for themselves, which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> now do; and we may suppose,
that common Heathens had much such Apprehensions about
them, as common Papists have: Those who had any sense
could not believe them to be Gods; and those who have none,
may believe any thing: but there is no great regard to be had
to such Mens Faith, whatever their Religion be, who are void
of common Sense. However this Dispute, whether the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
did believe their Images to be Gods, or to have any more
Divinity in them, than Papists attribute to their Images, is
a Dispute still, and Monsieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has not said one word
to prevent it; and therefore the Condemnation of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
for worshipping Images is still a good Objection against
the worship of Images in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> till he prove
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53692:32"/>
as well as assert this difference between them.</p>
               <p>But indeed, tho I readily grant that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
does not believe that there is any Divinity in their Images,
and that the Heathens did believe that Consecration brought
down the Gods, whom they worshipped by such Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and tied them by some invisible Charms to their
Image, that they might be always present there to receive
their Worship; yet this makes no material difference in their
Notion of Images.</p>
               <p>The reason why the Heathens thought it necessary by
some Magical Arts to fasten their Gods, or some Divine
Powers to their Images, was not to incorporate them with
their Images, but to secure a Divine Presence there, to hear
their Prayers, and receive their Sacrifices, without which all
their Devotions paid to an Image were lost; which was very
necessary, especially in the Worship of their Inferior Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
whom they did not believe to be present in all places.
As <hi>Elijah</hi> mocked the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 18. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>and said, Cry aloud; for
he is a God: either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a
Journy, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</hi> But
now, those who believe that God is every where present to
fee and hear what we do; and that the Saints, who are
not present in their Images, yet do certainly know (by
what means soever it be) what Prayers and Homages are
offered to them at their Images, need not call down any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Powers constantly to attend their Images, but only to
procure their acceptance of those Devotions, which are paid
to them at their Images. And this is the difference between
the Consecration of Heathen and Popish Images: The first
is to procure the Presence of their Gods in their Images;
the other to obtain the Favour of Christ, and the Saints, to
accept those Prayers and Oblations, and other Acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
which are offered to them at their Images; as to
give but one Instance of it in a Prayer used at the Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Cross.<note place="margin">Pontif. in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. nov. eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</note>

let the Blessing of that Wood, on which the holy Members of our
Saviour hung, be on this Wood; that those, who pray and bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
before this Cross, may obtain Health both of Body and Soul.</hi>
This peculiar Virtue which Consecration bestows on Images
to obtain the Favour of Christ and his Saints, to those who
pray and worship before them, is all that the Heathens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in calling down their Gods to attend their Images
to hear and receive their Prayers and Sacrifices. They did
not believe their Images to be Gods, but Silver, or Gold,
Wood, or Brass, or Stone, according to the Materials they
were made of, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does; but they thought
their Gods were present to hear the Prayers they made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Images; as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> also believes, that
Christ and his Saints have a peculiar regard to those Prayers
which are made before their Images, as is evident from their
forms of consecrating Images to such an use. The Heathens
did not put their trust in an Image of Wood and Stone, but
in that God, who was represented by that Image, and was
there present to help them. And thus, tho the Church of
<hi>Rome does not demand any Favour of Images, nor put any Trust
in them,</hi> yet she expects the Relief and Acceptance of Christ
and the Saints for that Worship she pays to their Images;
and I would desire any Man to show me the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these two, especially when we consider how much
greater Vertue is attributed to some Images of the Blessed
Virgin in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than there is to others; as
to the Image of the Lady of <hi>Loretto,</hi> &amp;c. which can signify
nothing less, than that the Virgin is more pleased with, and
will more graciously accept our Worship before such an
Image, than any other; or else me-thinks the Devotoes of the
Virgin should not go so many Miles in Pilgrimage to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of <hi>Loretto,</hi> as they often do, if they believed the Images
of the Virgin which they had at home to be of equal Power:
which is as much trusting in Images, and attributing a Divine
Virtue to them, as ever the Heathens were guilty of. For
me-thinks those who strictly adhere to the Letter of Scripture
to prove that the Heathens believed their Images to be
Gods, and did put their Trust in them, because the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53692:33"/>
expresly says so, should consider also, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
expresly tells us, <hi>that the Idols of the Heathens are Silver
and Gold, the Work of Mens hands; they have Mouths, but they
speak not;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psalm 135. 15, 16, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Eyes have they, but they see not; they have Ears,
but they hear not, neither is there any Breath in their Mouths:</hi>
and therefore we have as much reason to conclude, that the
Heathens did not put their Trust in the material Images,
which they knew to be no better than stupid senseless matter,
which could not of themselves hear or help them, as to
confess, that in some sense they made Gods of them. For
if the Heathens did not believe them to be dead senseless
Images, which could neither speak, nor see, nor hear, but
that they were really animated by invisible Spirits; they
were not such dull and sottish Idolaters, as the Psalmist re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
them; and if they did (as the Psalmist takes
it for granted they themselves acknowledged) than it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
they could not believe the material Images to be Gods,
nor the Objects of their Hope and Trust, and therefore
might (as some of their Philosophers in effect did) as safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
renounce <hi>believing any Divinity or Vertue in their Images,
for which they ought to be reverenced, or demanding any Fav<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ur
of them, or putting any Trust in them,</hi> as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
does. So that their not believing any Divinity in their
Images, does neither excuse them from the Breach of the
second Commandment, nor sufficiently distinguish the Church
of <hi>Rome's</hi> worshipping Images, from that Worship which the
Heathens gave them; at least the Bishop has said nothing to
answer or prevent these Objections against Image-worship,
which he pretends to be the design of his Exposition.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>As a fuller Explication of the Doctrine of the Church
about Image-worship, Monsieur</hi> de Meaux <hi>adds, that the
Council of</hi> Trent ordains, That all the Honour which is given to
them <hi>(Images)</hi> should be referred to the Saints themselves, which
are represented by them: <hi>Or, as the Council expresses it,</hi> The
Honour we render to Images has such a reference to those they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present,
<hi>(ad Prototypa quae illae representant,</hi> to the Prototypes
which they represent) that by the means of those Images <hi>(per Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,</hi>
by those Images) we kiss, and before which we kneel, we
adore Jesus Christ, and honour the Saints, whose Types they are.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53692:33"/>
                  <hi>Quorum illae similitudinem gerunt;</hi> Whose likeness they are,
or whom they represent.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have no Exposition at all of the Doctrine of
the Church about Image-Worship, but only a bare relation
what the Council says, that Images must be worshipped only
upon account of their Representation; and that the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which is given to the Image, is referred to the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type:
This all Roman-Catholicks agree in; but yet there is
an endless Dispute among them, about the Nature and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of this Worship, and it will be necessary to take a short
view of it.</p>
               <p>They are all agreed, that at least the external Acts of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration
are to be paid to Images, such as Kissing, Kneeling,
Bowing, Prostration, Incense; this <hi>Durandus,</hi> and <hi>Holcot,</hi>
and <hi>Picus Mirandula</hi> allowed; they all agreed, that the
Worship which was given to Images, is upon account of
Representation, or as Christ and his Saints are represented by
them, and worshipped in that Worship, which is given to
their Images; but then there was a threefold difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them.</p>
               <p>1. That some would not allow this Worship in a proper
sense to be given to the Images, but <hi>improperly</hi> and <hi>abusively;</hi>
because at the presence of the Image, which excites in us
the remembrance of the Object, we worship the Object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by it, Christ or his Saints, as if they were actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
present; this was the Opinion of <hi>Durandus, Holcot,</hi> and
<hi>Picus Mirandula,</hi> who could hardly escape the censure of
Heresy for it;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vasquez</hi> D<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sp. 106. c. 1.</note> and that which excused them, as <hi>Vasquez</hi>
says, was, That they agreed with the Catholick Church in
performing all external Acts of Adoration to Images, and
that they differed only in manner of speaking from the
rest.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and his Followers, and several great
Divines since the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> teach, That the same
Worship is to be given to the Image, which is due to the
Prototype; and therefore as Christ must be worshipped
with <hi>Latria,</hi> or a supream Worship, so must the Image of
Christ, because the Image is worshipped only on account of
its Representation, and therefore must be worshipped with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53692:34"/>
the same Worship with the thing represented: and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Mind to an Image, as an Image, is the same with
the motion to the Thing represented. Which seems the
most reasonable Account; for if I worship Christ by his
Image, I must give that Worship to the Image which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
for Christ, because in that case the Image is in Christ's
place and stead to me.</p>
               <p>3. The third Opinion is, That though we must worship
Images, yet we must not give the Worship of <hi>Latria</hi> to
them, no not to the Image of Christ himself, but an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
degree of Worship. This some Divines asserted on the
Authority of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which expresly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
that <hi>Latria</hi> is not to be given to Images. But this is
the most absurd Opinion of all; for if we must worship
Images only upon the account of their Representation, we
must give that Worship to them, which is due to the thing
represented by them; and if we give any other Worship
to them, we must worship them for their own sakes. And
what is that Worship which is due to them as separated
from the Prototype? What Worship is due to carved and
polished Brass and Stone? Whoever desires to see these three
different Opinions, with the proper Reasons of them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
more at large, may consult Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s learned
Defence of his Discourse of Idolatry, <hi>Part 2. Chap. 1. pag.
575, &amp;c.</hi> Now the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> only determines, that
the Honour we give to Images, must be referred to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totypes,
that we must adore Christ and his Saints in that
Worship which we give to their Images: which seems to
countenance the second Opinion, That the Worship of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi>
is to be given to the Image of Christ, because that is the
Worship which we must give to Christ: But then the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
refers to the second Council of <hi>Nice;</hi> which determines
the quite contrary; and I dare not undertake to reconcile
the Council with it self, since the Fathers of that Council
would not plainly decide this Controversy among their
Divines.</p>
               <p>Let us then try, if we can discover, what Monsieur <hi>de
Meaux</hi> thinks of this Matter; what Worship that is which
he allows to be given to Images.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:53692:34"/>
Now, as far as I can guess, he is of <hi>Durandus</hi> his Opinion,
That all External Acts of Adoration are to be performed
before the Image, but that the Image is not to be properly
worshipped, but only Christ in the presence of his Image,
as representing his Person to us, and exciting in us the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of him.<note place="margin">Pag. 9.</note> Thus he tells us, That <hi>while the Image
of Christ crucified, being present before our Eyes, causes so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a remembrance in our Souls, we are moved to testify by some
exteriour signs, how far our gratitude bears us; and by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
our selves before the Image, we show what is our submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to our Saviour.</hi> So that he allows of <hi>humbling our selves
before the Image,</hi> that is, of paying the External Acts of
Worship before it. Well! but is this to worship the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage?
For that he tells us, <hi>to speak properly, and according to
the Ecclesiastical Stile,</hi> (I suppose he means a new Modern
Stile, for the old Ecclesiastical Stile did somewhat differ)
<hi>when we honour the Image of an Apostle or Martyr, our Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is not so much to honour the Image, as to honour the Apostle
or Martyr in the presence of the Image:</hi> that is, this is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
but <hi>improperly and abusively</hi> called the Worship or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the Image: but Christ, or his Saints, are properly
worshipped before, or in presence of their Images, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
them to us; which was exactly the Opinion of
<hi>Durandus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This certainly is the least that can be made of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Images; and yet as far removed as this Opinion
seems to be from the Opinion of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who affirms,
that the Worship of <hi>Latria</hi> is to be given to the Image of
Christ; I take them to be the very same, though very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
expressed. The right stating of this, will mightily tend
to clear this perplexed Controversy; and therefore I shall
do it with all the plainness I can.</p>
               <p>1. Then I observe, that to pay the external Acts of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<hi>to,</hi> or <hi>before,</hi> or <hi>in presence</hi> of a representative Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
as representing, signify the very same thing; it is all
one kind of Worship, because the formal Reason is the same
in all; and that is, the Representation. When I bow to
the Image of Christ, I bow to it as representing Christ to
me, who is the ultimate Object of my Worship; when I
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53692:35"/>
bow before, or in the presence of the Image, I do the same
thing, tho I give it a new Name; I bow before it, as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Christ to me, as if he himself were there personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
present in the Image. When I bow to the Image, I do
not bow to the Wood or Stone, but to Christ as represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Image: when I bow to Christ before the Image,
I do the same thing, I bow to Christ as represented in the
Image which stands before me. For suppose Christ were
there present instead of the Image, would it make any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in my Worship, to say, That I bow to Christ, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, or in his presence, when they all signify, that I
direct my Worship to him as personally present; no more
difference is there in bowing to, or before, or in the presence
of the Image, when I direct my Worship to Christ as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by the Image. There may indeed be a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between bowing to my Prince, and in the presence
of my Prince, when these Expressions signify different Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
for I may bow to another Man <hi>in the presence</hi> of my
Prince, and in that Act I do not bow <hi>to</hi> my Prince; but
when <hi>to,</hi> and <hi>before,</hi> and <hi>in presence,</hi> do not distinguish the
Objects, the Act is the same: If the presence of the Image
were an accidental thing, and had no relation to that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which we pay to Christ or the Saints, where such Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are present, there would be a great difference between
bowing <hi>to,</hi> and <hi>in presence</hi> of the Image; but if these Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
be on purpose set up in Consecrated Places, and are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
consecrated for that use, to represent Christ and the
Saints to us; whether we say we bow to them, or before
them, we do the same thing, and with the same intention,
to worship Christ and his Saints as represented by them. So
that if we own, as the Bishop does, that the Honour done
before the Image, goes to the Prototype, to Christ, or the
Saints represented by such Images, we need not dispute
about the manner of expressing it; he may take his own
way of speaking, that he honours Christ in the presence of
his Image, so he honours Christ as represented by the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage;
and therefore, in Scripture, to fall down before and
to the Image, and to worship the Image, are all equivalent
Expressions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:53692:35"/>
There is indeed a vast difference between bowing to, or
before an Image, which represents God, or Christ, or some
Divine Being to us, as the Object of our Worship; and
bowing towards a Place, or worshipping God towards a
Place, as the Jews worshipped towards the Temple, and in
the Temple towards the Mercy-Seat; the one was absolutely
forbid by the Jewish Law, the other allowed and practised
by the devoutest Worshippers of God: which argues, that
there is some difference between them; and it is not hard to
say, wherein the difference consists, that one is a represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Object, the other only a Circumstance of Worship.
To bow to, or before an Image, is to worship the Image,
or God or Christ by the Image, which makes the Image as
representing the Prototype, the Object of our Worship;
but which way soever we look or bow, towards the East,
or towards the West, God alone is the immediat Object of
our Worship, the Place only the Circumstance of Worship;
whenever we bow to God, we must bow towards some
Place or other: but the Place does not represent God to us
as an Image does, and therefore is no Object of Worship:
which shows what little reason the Protestor had to compare
<hi>bowing to the Altar, and kneeling to the Sacrament,</hi> as he calls
it, with bowing to an Image. There is no Man of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> that I know of, who bows to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar;
I am sure the Church no where teaches any such Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
She only recommends to her Children bowing of the
Body to God, when they come in and go out of his House;
and though the Communion Table, or Altar, is generally so
scituated at the East end of the Church, as to be opposite to
the entrance of it;<note place="margin">See <hi>Dr. Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingst.</hi> Defence of the Disc. of Idol. <hi>p. 703, &amp;c.</hi> And several Conferences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Romish Priest, <hi>&amp;c. p. 211, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> for which reason some have called it,
bowing <hi>towards the Altar;</hi> yet our Church teaches us to
have no regard at all to it. And Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> in his
Speech in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> declares, That <hi>if there were no
Table standing, he would worship God when he came into his
House:</hi> So that there is no need <hi>to find any Hole,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testor
speaks, <hi>to get out at with the Altar,</hi> for that was never
in yet, as far as this Controversy is concerned; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am like to make no breach for him <hi>to follow at with his
Image.</hi> Nor does any Man <hi>kneel to the Sacrament,</hi> but only
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53692:36"/>
receive the Sacrament kneeling; and if he cannot distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
between an Act of Worship to the Sacrament, and a
devout Posture of receiving it; yet the meanest Son of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> can. Why does he not as well say, that
when we kneel at Prayers, we worship the Common-Prayer
Book which lies before us, and out of which we read, as
that we worship the Bread, when we receive and eat it with
devout Passions upon our Knees.</p>
               <p>But to return to the Exposition.</p>
               <p>2. I observe, that there is a great difference between a
memorative Sign, and the Representation of an Image:
both of them indeed excite in us the remembrance of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but in such different manners, as quite alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of them. It is necessary to take notice of this, because
I find Monsieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and after him the Representer,
very much to equivocate in this Matter: it is a very inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
thing to worship God or Christ, when any natural or
instituted Sign brings them to our minds, even in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of such a Sign: As if a Man upon viewing the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and the Earth, and the Creatures that are in it, should
raise his Soul to God, and adore the great Creator of the
World; or upon the accidental sight of a natural Cross,
should call to mind the Love of his Lord, who died for him,
and bow his Soul to him in the most submissive Adorations;
because, I say, this is very innocent, the Bishop would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
his Readers, that this is the only use they make of
Images, <hi>to excite in us the remembrance of those they represent;</hi>
and mightily wonders at the <hi>little justice of those, who treat
with the term of Idolatry, that religious Sentiment, which moves
them to uncover their Heads, or bow them before the Image of the
Cross, in remembrance of him who was crucified for the Love of
us.</hi> And that it is sufficient to distinguish them from the
Heathen Idolaters, <hi>That they declare, that they will not make
use of Images, but to raise the mind towards Heaven, to the end
that they may there honour Jesus Christ or his Saints, and in the
Saints God himself, who is the Author of all Sanctity and Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is certain, an Image will call to our remembrance
the Person it represents, as the presence of the Person him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
will make us remember him; but this vastly differs from
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53692:36"/>
a meer memorative Sign. For the use of Images in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not primarily for Remembrance, but for
Worship, as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> expresly teaches. <hi>That
the Images of Christ, and the Virgin the Mother of God, and
other Saints, are especially to be had and kept in Churches, and due
Honour and Veneration to be given to them—because the Honour
given to them, is referred to the Prototypes, which they represent;
so that by the Images, which we kiss, and before which we uncover
our Heads, and prostrate our selves, we adore Christ, and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the Saints, whose likeness they bear.</hi> These are the words
of the Council, and it would be a very odd Comment upon
such a Text to say, that Images serve only for Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
               <p>A meer Sign, which only calls Christ to our Minds, can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
no Honour or Worship; but a representing Sign, which
puts us in mind of Christ by representing his Person to us,
as if he were present, whether it raises our hearts to him
in Heaven or not, yet according to the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> it
must direct our Worship to him, as represented in his Image.
When Men go to Church to worship <hi>Christ,</hi> or the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> before their Images, it may be presumed they think
of them before they see their Images, and therefore do not
go to be put in remembrance of them by their Images, but
to worship them before the Images, in that Worship which
they give to the Images. And therefore when the Bishop
speaks so often of the Virtue of Images, to excite in us the
remembrance of the Persons they represent, to reconcile him
with himself, and with the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to own, we must not understand him as if Images were
of no use but to be helps to memory, and are honoured for
no other reason, (which is no reason at all) as the unwary
Reader will be apt to mistake him; but that these visible
Images represent to us the invisible Objects of our Worship,
and give us such a sense of their Power and Presence, as makes
us fall down and worship them before those Representations,
which we honour for their sakes; that is, tho they serve for
remembrance, yet not as meer memorative Signs, but as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morative
or representative Objects of Worship.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:53692:37"/>
3. I observe, that it is the very same thing whether we
say, that we worship Christ as represented by the Image, or
worship the Image as representing Christ, for they both sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
that Christ is worshipped in and by his Image, that the
Honour and Worship is given to the Image, and referr'd to
the Prototype. If Christ be worshipped as represented by
the Image, then the Worship which is intended for Christ is
given to the Image in his Name, and as his Representative;
if the Image be worshipped as representing Christ, then the
Worship which is given to the Image, is not for it self, but
for Christ, whom it represents; which differ just as much as
a Viceroy's being honoured for the King, or the King's being
honoured in his Viceroy. And therefore I wonder, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Man of Understanding and Judgment, as Monsieur <hi>de
Meaux</hi> certainly is, should think there is any great matter in
saying, <hi>When we honour the Image of an Apostle or Martyr, our
Intention is not so much to honour the Image<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as to honour the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
or Martyr in the presence of the Image;</hi> that is, in and by
the Image, as I have showed that Ph<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>se signifies, when it
is referred to a Representati<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for it is the very
same thing to say, we honour the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> as representing the
Martyr, or we honour the Martyr as represented by the
Image.</p>
               <p>Having premised these things, let us now compare the
Opinion of Monsieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> with the Opinion of St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Aquinas</hi> about the Worship of Images; and tho the first
is thought by some Men to say a great deal too little, and the
other a great deal too much; yet it will appear, that their
Opinions in this matter are the very same.</p>
               <p>They both agree, That Christ and his Saints are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by their Images; they both agree, that Christ and
his Saints are worshipped in their Images, as represented by
them; they both agree, that no other Worship is to be paid
to, or before, or in presence of the Image, but only that
Worship which is due to the <hi>Prototype,</hi> to Christ or his Saints
represented by such Images: Hence <hi>Thomas</hi> asserts, that the
Image is to be worshipped with that Worship which is due
to the Prototype; the Image of Christ with <hi>Latria,</hi> because
that is due to Christ; and the Images of the Saints with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53692:37"/>
                  <hi>Dulia,</hi> because that degree of Worship is proper to them;
and the Bishop teaches, <hi>That when they honour the Image of an
Apostle or Martyr, their Intention is not so much to honour the
Image, as to honour the Apostle or Martyr in presence of the Image:</hi>
that is, they perform no other Act of Worship in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Images, but that which is proper to the Apostle
and Martyr; and therefore they both agree, that there is
but one motion of the Mind to the Image, and to the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type
represented by it; that is, as the Bishop speaks, they
have but one Intention, and that is to honour the Apostle or
Martyr in the presence of the Image: and yet after all, they
seem vastly to differ; for <hi>Thomas</hi> says, that they give the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the Prototype to its Image; that is, that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Image of Christ with <hi>Latria,</hi> which is the Worship
due to Christ; but the Bishop will not own, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
give any Worship at all to Images, but only worship
Christ, or the Saints in the presence of the Images; Christ
indeed with <hi>Latria,</hi> and the Saints with <hi>Dulia,</hi> but their
Images properly with neither: and yet this difference is
only in words, as <hi>Vasquez</hi> confesses concerning <hi>Durandus</hi> and
<hi>Holcot,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> follows, <hi>that they agreed with the
Catholick Church, in performing all external Acts of Adoration
to Images, and that they differed only in manner of speaking from
the rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, as I have already shew'd, to worship the Image, or
before, and in the presence of the Image, when it signifies
a Representative Object, is the same thing; and there is no
difference between worshipping the Image as representing
Christ, and worshipping Christ as represented by the Image;
and yet this is all the difference between Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> and
<hi>Thomas Aquinas:</hi> Tho I think <hi>Thomas</hi> speaks most properly;
for if Christ be worshipped in his Image, we must give the
Worship to the Image, which we intended for Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ is worshipped in that Worship we give to his
Image; and therefore he cannot be worshipped by his Image,
if his Image be not worshipped; of which more presently.</p>
               <p>Durandus <hi>indeed, whose Opinion Mr.</hi> de Meaux <hi>seems to
follow, did in words oppose the Doctrine of</hi> Thomas, <hi>that
the Worship of the Prototype ought not to be given to an
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53692:38"/>
Image,</hi> because the Image and the Prototype were two distinct
things; and therefore what belonged to the Exemplar could not be
attributed to an Image, however considered as an Image; and so
the Worship due to the Exemplar could not be given to the Image:
<hi>but yet he plainly grants all that</hi> Thomas <hi>intended by it;</hi> that
the Image may be said to be worshipped with the same Worship
with the thing represented; because at the presence of the Image,
we worship the Object represented by it, as if he were actually
present.</p>
               <p>But I have a better reason than this to believe that they
were both of a Mind, tho they expressed themselves very
differently; and that is, because their Arguments, whereby
they confirm their several Opinions are the same, and then
it is not likely that their Opinions should much differ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Durandus</hi> proves,<note place="margin">Durand. in Sent. 3. Dist. 9. q. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Images are not to be worshipped,
but only improperly and abusively; because at their presence we
call to mind those Objects represented by them, which are worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
before the Images, as if they were present,</hi> by such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
as these: that Worship properly belongs only to that
Being in whom the cause of Worship is, and that only to his
Person, upon account of his adorable Perfections, which are
the cause of that Worship; and therefore <hi>Latria,</hi> or Supream
Worship can be due only to God, upon account of his Deity.
But that which is no Subject capable of Holiness and Vertue,
cannot in it self be the term of Adoration; and therefore
proper Worship can never be due to the Image of Christ, or
to his Cross; for tho Christ be represented by his Image,
there is a real difference in the thing, and in the conception
between the Image and the thing represented; and therefore,
properly speaking, the same Worship is never due to the
Image, that is to the Object represented by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> on the other side proves, that the Image
must be worshipped with that Worship which is due to the
Prototype, or the thing represented by it, by much the same
Arguments.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That no irrational Creature is capable of Worship, but with
a respect to a rational Being,</hi> which answers to <hi>Durandus</hi> his
reason, that Worship properly belongs only to that Being, in
whom the cause of Worship is; and that which is no Subject
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53692:38"/>
capable of Holiness and Vertue (as no inanimate, or irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Creature is, and therefore no Image) cannot in it self
be the term of Adoration. From which it appears that
they must agree, that no proper Worship can be given to
Images. 2. <hi>Because Images are to be worshipped upon account
of their Representation; therefore they are to be worshipped with
the same Worship of the thing represented. 3. Because the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Mind towards an Image, as an Image, is the same with
the motion towards the thing represented.</hi> So that <hi>Thomas</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allows, that the Image is not to be worshipped at all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
its own account, but only as it represents; and to worship
the Image as it represents, is the very same act with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
the Object as represented by the Image; because
the motion of the Mind towards an Image, as an Image, that
is, as it represents, is the same with the motion towards the
thing represented: That to worship an Image as represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Christ, is the same thing with worshipping Christ as
represented by the Image; and therefore the same Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
which is due to Christ, must be given to his Image, as
representing him; or to him as represented by the Image. So
that according to <hi>Thomas</hi> his reasoning, there is no difference
between his giving the Worship of Christ to his Image, as
representing him, and <hi>Durandus</hi> his worshipping Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Image, as represented by it, as if he were actually
present. <hi>Thomas</hi> could not have quarrelled with <hi>Durandus,</hi>
because he owns it is the same thing, tho <hi>Durandus</hi> quarrels
with <hi>Thomas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Vasquez,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vasquez</hi> Disp. 106. c. 1.</note> who seems to understand the
Doctrine of <hi>Thomas</hi> as well as any Man, acknowledges that
<hi>Durandus</hi> and <hi>Holcot</hi> differed only in manner of speaking from
the rest; and freely declares his own Opinion to be, that
<hi>an Image cannot be lawfully worshipped any other way than as in
and by that the Exemplar is made the term and next material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Adoration:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Idem <hi>Disp.</hi> 108. c. 3.</note> and he gives this Reason for it, <hi>because no
inanimate thing is of it self capable of Worship; but an Image con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as an Image, but without the Exemplar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>is an inanimate
thing.</hi> This is the Doctrine of <hi>Thomas</hi> according to <hi>Vasquez,</hi>
which allows no more Worship to an Image, considered in
it self, then <hi>Durandus</hi> does, and yet he says, <hi>that it may be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53692:39"/>
delivered absolutely,<note place="margin">Disp. 109. c. 1.</note> that Images are to be worshipped with</hi> Latria,
<hi>if by that be meant the same Worship, which is given to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bellarm.</hi> de Cultu Imag. l. 2.</note>
And therefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us, <hi>That to give the
Worship of</hi> Latria <hi>to the Image of Christ, as representing Christ,
is to worship the Image but improperly,</hi> and <hi>per accidens;</hi> and
this reconciles <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Durandus,</hi> who grants that the
Image may be said to be worshipped improperly and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively,
as in presence of the Image, the Object is worshipped
represented by it, as if it were actually present.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Durandus</hi> his Argument against <hi>Thomas</hi> his Doctrine,
that the Worship of the Prototype is to be given to the
Image, <hi>That there is a real difference in the thing, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
between the Image and the thing represented; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note>
                  <hi>properly speaking, the same Worship is never due to the
Image, that is to the Object represented by it.</hi> I think, if any
Worship of Images were justifiable, this Argument were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answered. For tho there be a great difference indeed in
the nature of things, between the Image and the Object, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ suppose, and his Image which represents him;
yet in this case there is none in the Conception; for an Image
when it receives our Worship in the place and stead of the
Prototype, does not represent according to the usual nature
of an Image by its likeness and similitude; for so both in
the thing and in the conception the Image differs from the
Object it represents; but it represents as a Proxy and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,
who in the eye of the Law, is the same Person with
him, whom he represents. Thus <hi>Thomas</hi> must understand
the Representation of an Image, when he says, that it is
the same motion of the Mind to the Image, and the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar
represented by it; that is, that the Image is supposed
to supply the place of Christ, and represent him present to
us; and therefore we worship the Image as Christ's Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
with that Worship we would give to him were he
actually present; this is not indeed the natural use of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
nor is it natural to worship them, but this is the true
Interpretation of <hi>Thomas</hi> his Doctrine;<note place="margin">Greg. de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. <hi>de Idolol. l. 2. c.</hi> 7.</note> and therefore <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius

Christ's stead:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cajent. in Aq. 3 <hi>p. q. 25. art.</hi> 3.</note> And Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> says, <hi>That Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is the reason of the Worship of the Image; and his being in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53692:39"/>
the Image is the condition by which the reason of the Worship doth
excite Men to worship and terminate it:</hi> that is, Christ is in his
Image, as a King is in his Viceroy, or any Man in his legal
Proxy:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Suarez</hi> Disp. 54 Sect. 4.</note> This is what <hi>Suarez</hi> meant by the <hi>esse reale,</hi> and <hi>esse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentativum</hi>
of the Prototype; that tho the Image does not
contain Christ in the first sense in his own proper Person, yet
it does in the second sense as his legal Proxy, and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
And this <hi>Durandus</hi> himself must acknowledg, if there
be any sense in his words, <hi>That at the presence of the Image,
we worship the Object represented by it, as if he were actually
present.</hi> For why should he in the presence of the Image,
worship Christ represented by it, as if he were actally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
unless he account the Image the Substitute and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative
of Christ, as if he were actually present; and
this, I think, reconciles that appearance of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Durandus,</hi> occasioned by a Misapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of <hi>Thomas</hi> his Doctrine. <hi>Durandus</hi> owns the Worship
of Christ in the presence of the Image, as he is represented
in the Image, as if he were actually present, which is
Mr. <hi>de Meaux</hi> his Opinion also in this matter; but he will
not allow this, but only <hi>in an improper</hi> and <hi>abusive</hi> sense, to
be the Worship of the Image, because the Image is not
Christ, but both in the thing and in the conception is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from him; and therefore to worship the Image of
Christ, would be to worship Wood or Stone, with the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Christ: Whereas <hi>Thomas</hi> considers the Image not as
to its external matter or form, upon which account he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
any Worship to be given to it, but as the Proxy and
Representative of Christ; and thus it is Christ represented
in the Image, and not the material Image, which is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped;
which is the very same with <hi>Durandus</hi> his way
of worshipping Christ as represented in the Image, in
the presence of the material Image; that is, he worships
before the material Image, but worships only the Person of
Christ, as represented by the Image.</p>
               <p>But this will be better understood by considering the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and capacity of a legal Proxy or Representative. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<hi>A</hi> were to all intents and purposes a legal Proxy for
<hi>B,</hi> to do, and to receive whatever <hi>B</hi> might do and receive
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53692:40"/>
in his own Person; in this case <hi>A</hi> is not considered as <hi>A,</hi> in
his own personal Capacity, but <hi>A</hi> is <hi>B,</hi> as his Proxy and
Representative. Suppose now that <hi>C</hi> owes a Sum of Mony,
or a certain Homage to <hi>B,</hi> and pays it to <hi>A</hi> as <hi>B</hi>'s Proxy;
that is, not as he is <hi>A,</hi> but <hi>B.</hi> When <hi>C</hi> worships <hi>A</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the Person of <hi>B,</hi> he is properly said not to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<hi>A,</hi> but <hi>B;</hi> because he worships <hi>A</hi> not as <hi>A,</hi> but as <hi>A</hi> is <hi>B,</hi>
in his Representative Capacity. Now if you will suppose
<hi>A</hi> to be the Image, and <hi>B</hi> to be Christ, this explains in what
sense <hi>Thomas</hi> worships the Image for Christ, not as the Image
is Wood or Stone, but as it is the Representative of Christ's
Person. Now suppose <hi>D</hi> should scruple paying the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>B</hi> to <hi>A,</hi> because <hi>A</hi> is a distinct Person from <hi>B,</hi> and
has no right to the same Worship; and therefore should on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worship <hi>B</hi> in the presence of <hi>A,</hi> as representing him;
would not all the World see, that <hi>D</hi> and <hi>C</hi> meant and did
the same thing, worshipped <hi>A</hi> as the Representative of <hi>B,</hi>
tho <hi>D</hi> is pleased to phrase it otherwise, and more improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than <hi>C</hi> does; for the personal Capacity of <hi>A</hi> is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
at all, when it is worshipped for <hi>B,</hi> but only his
Representative Capacity; and this is the only difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Durandus. Thomas</hi> worships the Image
in Christ's place and stead, as representing Christ, without
considering its natural Capacity as an Image of Wood or
Stone; as <hi>C</hi> worships <hi>A</hi> as <hi>B</hi>'s Proxy, without considering
<hi>A</hi>'s personal Capacity: but <hi>Durandus</hi> worships Christ as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by the Image (which is the same with the Image
representing Christ) in the presence of the Image consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in its natural Capacity; as <hi>D</hi> worships <hi>B</hi> as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
by <hi>A,</hi> in the presence of <hi>A,</hi> considered in his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Capacity; that is, he worships representative <hi>A</hi> in the
presence of personal <hi>A,</hi> which is the same thing that <hi>C</hi>
does, but is a more uncouth and absurd way of speaking.</p>
               <p>Thus to proceed, When <hi>C</hi> worships <hi>A</hi> as <hi>B</hi>'s Proxy, in
his name and stead, does he worship <hi>A</hi> or <hi>B?</hi> he worships
<hi>A</hi> indeed, but considered as <hi>B;</hi> and therefore the Worship
given to <hi>A</hi> in the name of <hi>B,</hi> is not the Worship of <hi>A,</hi> but
of <hi>B;</hi> And will any Man say that <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B</hi> are two Objects
of Worship? when in this sense, <hi>A</hi> is <hi>B,</hi> and is considered
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53692:40"/>
only as <hi>B,</hi> that is, as <hi>B's</hi> Proxy; and therefore <hi>A</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as <hi>A,</hi> in his own personal Capacity, is not worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
at all, neither absolutely nor relatively, <hi>per se,</hi> nor <hi>per
accidens;</hi> but if <hi>A</hi> be worshipped only as <hi>B,</hi> to say, that <hi>A</hi>
is worshipped relatively, or <hi>per accidens,</hi> is to say that <hi>B,</hi>
who is worshipped in <hi>A,</hi> is worshipped both absolutely and
relatively, properly and improperly, <hi>per se</hi> and <hi>per accidens;</hi>
which are some of the Objections which <hi>Catharinus</hi> and
others use against <hi>Thomas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much at the same rate others compare <hi>Thomas</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of worshipping the Image with the Worship of the
Prototype, as represented by it, with worshipping a Sign,
and the Thing signified; or worshipping the King and his
Robes, which are very remote from the Business, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
and confound a Doctrine, which is very easy to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
and easily rescued from those Scholastick Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
which are charged on it, if that were its only fault.
For the true Representation of it, is by considering the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a Proxy, and legal Representative, which acts in
another's name and stead.</p>
               <p>Having thus considered what is the Notion of Image-Worship,
according to <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Durandus,</hi> and Monsieur
<hi>de Meaux,</hi> that it is a worshipping the Image in the name
and stead of the Prototype, as its Proxy and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
worshipping the Image as representing Christ, as <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
speaks, or worshipping Christ before his Image as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
by it, as <hi>Durandus</hi> and M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> speak. We
have now some Foundation to build on; and I think they
have no reason to complain that I have stated it in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which grants them all they can desire or ask for, <hi>viz.</hi>
That they do not worship Images, as an Image signifies a
Figure of Wood or Stone; but they worship the Image as
representing Christ; or if they like that better, Christ as
represented in his Image; <hi>That when they honour the Image of
an Apostle or Martyr, they do not so much intend to honour the
Image, as the Apostle or Martyr in the presence of the Image.</hi>
Let us then consider whether this will justify them; and if
this will not, I doubt their Cause is desperate. And in order
to this, I shall do these three things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:53692:41"/>
1. Show you, that this is the only intelligible Notion of
worshipping God, or Christ, or the Saints, by Images;
that Images are a kind of legal Proxies and Representatives,
to receive our Worship in the name and stead of Christ, or
the Saints.</p>
               <p>2. That this is the Scripture Notion of Image-Worship;
and that in this sense it is the Scripture condemns the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of Images, as practised by the Heathens.</p>
               <p>3. I shall show, wherein the Evil of worshipping Images
according to this Notion consists.</p>
               <p>1. That this is the only intelligible Notion of worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
God, or Christ, or the Saints, by Images; that Images
are a kind of legal Proxies and Representatives to receive
our Worship in the name and stead of the Prototype, or the
Being represented by them.</p>
               <p>The Reason of worshipping Images, is to do Honour to
some Divine Being represented by these Images: for the
true occasion of Image-Worship, is that fondness Men have
for a visible Object of Worship; and because they cannot
see the Gods they worship, therefore they set up Images, as
visible and representative Deities, to receive their Worship
in the name and stead of their Gods. Now if we grant,
that Men intend to worship their Gods, in that Worship
they pay to, or before their Images, we must grant that
these Images are instead of visible Gods to them, or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the place of their Gods, and receive Worship in their
Names.</p>
               <p>For to worship God, or any Divine Being, by an Image,
can signify neither more nor less, than to worship God, or
Christ, or the Saints, in that Worship which we give to
their Images: for God cannot be worshipped in an Image
any otherwise, than as the Worship which is given to the
Image is his Worship, and given in his Name: for <hi>B</hi> can
be worshipped in <hi>A,</hi> only as <hi>A</hi> is <hi>B</hi>'s Representative, and
is worshipped in his name and stead. To worship any Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
is to worship his Person; and therefore we must either
worship him in his own natural Person, or in his Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative,
who is his legal Person.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:53692:41"/>
               <q>As to shew you this particularly.</q>
               <p>If any Men were ever so sottish as to believe their Images
themselves, that is, the visible Figures of Wood, or Stone,
or Brass, to be Gods, and to worship them as Gods, such
Men cannot be said to worship God by an Image, but to
worship an Image-God; for the Image it self is their God,
and the Worship terminates on the Image as God. They
may be said to worship false Gods, Gods, in a strict and
proper sense, of Wood and Stone; but to worship God
by an Image, and to worship the Image it self for a God,
are very distinct things: and if the Scripture forbids the
Worship of God by an Image, it will not justify Image-Worship,
to say, that some Heathens were such Sots, as to
believe their Images themselves to be Gods; for Men who
are not such Sots, may Worship their Gods by Images, as
all those Heathens did, who acknowledged their Images to
be only Symbols and Representations of their Gods, and
therefore not to be Gods themselves; for the same thing
cannot be a Symbol and Representation of it self; which is
as good sense as to say, that a Sign, and the thing signified
by it, is the same.</p>
               <p>To give a proper, though inferiour degree of worship to
Images themselves, is not to worship God or Christ by his
Image, because in this case, the Worship they give to the
Image of Christ, is not such a Worship as is proper for
Christ, and is terminated not on Christ, but on his Image.
No Worship is proper to be given to Christ, but the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>Latria,</hi> or supream and soveraign Worship: but the
Roman Doctors, who embrace this Opinion, deny with the
second Council of <hi>Nice</hi> that <hi>Latria</hi> may be given to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and in general reject the Doctrine of <hi>Thomas,</hi> that the
Image is to be worshipped with the Worship due to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype:
And how then can Christ be worshipped in his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
if no Worship is given to the Image, which is fit for
Christ to receive? when the Image has no Worship given it,
but such as is proper to its self, considered as Christ's Image,
will they call this the Worship of Christ? especially since
this Worship which is given to the Image, is terminated on
the Image as its own proper and peculiar Worship, as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharinus</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:53692:42"/>
and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and all of this way acknowledg;
who reject <hi>Thomas</hi> his Doctrine of worshipping the Image,
with the worship of the Prototype represented by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this is not properly the Worship of the Image, but of
the Prototype; and therefore that the Image may be sure
to be worshipped, they give it an inferior degree of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which terminates on it self. Now how Christ should
be worshipped in that Worship which terminates on his
Image; that is, how that Worship which ends in the Image,
and goes no farther, should pass through the Image, and end
in Christ, as it must do, if Christ be worshipped in the
Image, is past my understanding, as all Contradictions
are.</p>
               <p>But they refer the Worship of the Image to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totype.
But it is worth enquiring how they do it; Do
they intend the Worship they give to the Image for Christ?
that is, Do they intend to worship Christ in that Worship
they give to his Image? No: they can't do that, because
they give only an inferior degree of Worship to the Image,
which is not worthy of Christ; not a Worship proper for
him, but only for his Image: but they worship the Image
for the sake of Christ; and this they take to be an Honour
to Christ to worship his Image: but this is not to worship
Christ in or by his Image; for in this way Christ is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
in that Worship we give to his Image, but it is to
worship the Image for Christ's sake, which is, by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
an Honour to Christ; as any respect we show to the
Image of the King, argues our Esteem and Honour for our
King, whose Image it is: but these two differ as much as to
honour Christ in our Actions, and to worship him, as to do
something which is, by interpretation, an Honour to Christ,
and to make our immediate Addresses, to offer up our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Thanksgivings to him. Every thing we do for the
Honour of Christ, is not presently an Act of Worship;
and therefore though we should grant, that we honour Christ
in the Worship of his Image, it does not follow, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we worship him in worshipping his Image, when we
give no Worship at all to him, but only to his Image; which
plainly shows, that in this way they do not worship Christ
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53692:42"/>
by his Image, but only worship the Image for Christ's sake.
Which is a plain Argument to me, that though this Way
has very great and learned Advocates, yet it cannot be the
meaning of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> because it is not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable
with the Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which
prays every day to Christ, and the blessed Virgin, to Saints
and Martyrs, before their Images, in such terms as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
only to be used to themselves; which besides the other
Faults of it, is horrid Non-sense, if they do not intend to
worship Christ and the Saints in their Images.</p>
               <p>Much less do those worship the Prototypes in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
who only use Images as helps to Memory, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
devout Affections in them, that at the sight of the Image
they may offer up more fervent Prayers to God or Christ:
for though this practice may and has a great many other
Faults in it, yet this is neither in the intention of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper,
to worship the Image, nor the Exemplar by the
Image. Monsieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> by some Expressions he uses,
would perswade his Readers, that this is all the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> intends in the use of Images; and yet he owns the
Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Trent, That the Honour of the
Image is referred to the Prototype, because by the Images which
we kiss, and before which we uncover our Heads, and prostrate
our selves, we adore Christ, and worship the Saints, whose Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
they bear.</hi> Which plainly signifies, that we worship Christ
and the Saints in the worship of their Images; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though Images may be helps to Memory also, yet they
must be honoured and worshipped, that Christ and his Saints
may be worshipped in them, and by them; which is a very
different thing from being bare Signs to help our Memories,
and quicken-our Devotions. There is no need of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration
for this End; and the Church takes no notice of this
use of them in her Forms of Consecration. These are all
the Pretences I have met with for the use of Images in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Worship: and it is evident from what I have said,
that there is no other sense, wherein God or Christ can be
said to be worshipped by an Image, but only as the Image
receives the Worship due to Christ in his Name and Stead, as
if it were his legal Proxy and Representative; which, as I
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53692:43"/>
have shewed, is the true Interpretation, both of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Durandus,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> in
this Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> I am now to show, that it is in this Notion the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
forbids the worship of Images, as the Representatives
of God, or any Divine Being, to receive our Worship in
God's Name and Stead. It is true indeed, the <hi>2d</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which forbids the worship of Images, takes no notice of
the Distinctions of the Schools, in what Notion an Image is
worshipped, or what kind and degree of Worship is given to
it; but the words are so large and general, as to exclude
all use of Images in Religious Worship. The Worship
which is expresly forbidden in the Commandment to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to Images, is only the External Acts of Worship, such
as to bow down to them; which is the very least that can
be done, if Men make any use of Images in Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
The Images which are forbidden to be worshipped,
are all sorts of Images whatever; <hi>The likeness of any Thing
which is in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, or in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under the Earth.</hi> And how extravagant soever Mens
Fancies are, they cannot well form any Image, but must be
like to some of these things, either in whole or in part.
But the Commandment takes no notice of Mens different
Opinions about Images, whether they look upon them as
Gods, or Representatives of God, or helps to Memory and
Devotion: for since the design of the Commandment is to
forbid the use of Images in Religious Worship, it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to leave any room for Distinctions; which is to make
every Man judg, what is an Innocent, and what is a sinful
use of Images; which would utterly evacuate the Law: for
Men of Wit can find out some Apology or other for the
grossest Superstitions.</p>
               <p>As for instance;</p>
               <p>I find a notable Criticism in the Advertisement to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de Meaux</hi> his Exposition, <hi>(p. 14.)</hi> That <hi>the Images for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
in the second Commandment, are those which are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to be made, as well as to be worshipped.</hi> The Consequence
of which is, That the Worship of such Images as may be
lawfully made, is not forbidden in this Law; and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53692:43"/>
there is room enough for the Worship of Images: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he will say, That it is unlawful to make the Images of
any thing in Heaven or Earth, or under the Earth; but
then they can have no Images to worship. <hi>Tertullian</hi> indeed,
and some others, condemned the very Arts of Painting and
Carving Images, as forbid in the second Commandment:
and it is certainly unlawful to make any Image in order to
worship it. But I desire to know of this Author, whether
it be lawful to make an Image or Picture of the Sun, and
Moon, and Planets; of Birds and Beasts, of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which are the Likeness of Things in Heaven, and
Things on Earth? If it be, then the making of those Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
is not forbid in the second Commandment, and then the
worship of them is not forbid neither. But he says, He
means such Images <hi>as are made to represent God, and those
which are made to show him present, and which are worshipped
with the same intention as full of his Divinity.</hi> But is this the
Work of the Carver, or the Painter, to make a God? Can
the Pencil, or the Knife, put Divinity into a Picture or
Image? This is the work of him that Consecrates, and him
that Worships.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Qui fingit Sacros auro vel marmore vultus</l>
                  <l>Non facit ille Deos, qui colit, ille facit.</l>
               </q>
               <p>He had forgot the Brazen Serpent which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> broke,
the making of which, I suppose, was not forbid in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Command, but it seems the worship of it was. But
to return:</p>
               <p>Though the second Commandment forbids the worship of
all sorts of Images, and every act and degree of Worship,
without leaving room for any Exceptions or Distinctions;
yet we may learn from Scripture, what was the currant No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Image-Worship at that time, <hi>viz.</hi> That they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
their Images, not for Gods, but for Symbols and
Representations of their Gods; that is, they set them up as
visible Objects of Worship, to receive their Worship in the
name and stead of their Gods: They did not worship the
Images themselves, but their Gods in and by their Images.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53692:44"/>
Indeed, this is the only Notion of Image-Worship that
any Men ever had, till Christians began to worship Images,
and then were forced to defend it, and to distinguish away
the Idolatry of it.</p>
               <p>This is the Account the Heathens gave of their Worship
of Images, That they did not believe them to be Gods, but
only worshipped their Gods in their Images. Thus <hi>Cicero</hi>
ascribes the making Images of their Gods in humane Shape,
to their Superstition,<note place="margin">De Natura de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum, l. 1. c. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Vt essent simulacra, quae vener antes deos
ipsos se adire crederent,</hi> that they might have Images to make
their Addresses to, as if the Gods themselves were present.
And <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> gives a large Account of their Images
to the same purpose,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Max. Tyrius,</hi> dissert. 38.</note> That they are all but so many Pictures
and Representations of the Deity, to bring us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of him; and it matters not what the Image be, so
it bring God to our Thoughts, and direct our Worship to
him; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Celsus</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> deny
that they thought their Images to be Gods; and so did the
Heathens in <hi>Arnobius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>p.</hi> 466, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and St. <hi>Austin,</hi> as those
Fathers acknowledg. And <hi>Julian</hi> tells us, That a lover of
God loves the Representations of the Gods; and beholding
their Images, doth secretly fear and reverence them, which
although invisible themselves, do behold him. And <hi>Dio
Chrysostom,</hi> in his Olympick Oration, gives this Account
why Men are so fond of Images, which they know cannot
express the invisible and inexpressible Nature of God,<note place="margin">Dio Chrys. Orat. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Mankind doth not love to worship God at a distance, but to
come near and feel him, and with assurance Sacrifice to him, and
Crown him.</hi> Nay, those very Heathens who believed that
some invisible Spirits after Consecration were, not incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
with their Images, (which it does not appear to me,
that any of them thought) but present in them; did not
therefore worship the material Figure, but through the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Image, worshipped those invisible Spirits which were
hid in it.<note place="margin">St. Aug. in Psal. 113.</note> 
                  <hi>Non hoc visibile colo, sed numen quod illic invisibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter
habitat.</hi> And therefore <hi>Arnobius</hi> says, That they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Images of their Gods, <hi>Vicariâ substitutione,</hi> that is,
to set them in the place of God,<note place="margin">Arnob, l. 6.</note> to be a vicarious Object of
Worship, to receive their Worship in the name of their
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53692:44"/>
Gods; and that God receives their Worship by Images, <hi>per
quaedam fidei commissa,</hi> by way of Trust; as if they were
intrusted to receive their Worship for God in his stead.
Hence St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, that no Image of God ought to be
worshipped, but only Christ, who is what he is; and he not
to be worshipped <hi>instead of God,</hi> but together with him;
which shows plainly what Notion the Father had of proper
Image-worship;<note place="margin">Aug. Ep. 119. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> that it is to worship the Image instead of
God: and therefore tho Christ be such an Image of God as
must be worshipped, yet he must not be worshipped as an
Image; that is, not in the stead, but together with God.
And St. <hi>Hierom</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. gives the same notion of Image-worship,
<hi>Quomodo invisibilis Deus per simulacrum visibile colere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi>
that it is to worship the invisible God by a visible Image:
and therefore falling down before their Images is called by
<hi>Arnobius,</hi>

Image-worship; thus St. <hi>Austin</hi> expresses it by <hi>adorat Vel

Fathers against the Worship of Images are levelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this Notion of it, that they worshipped their Gods by
Images, not that they thought their Images to be Gods. This
then being the received Notion of Image-worship among the
Heathens, in which they all agreed, as far as we have any
account of their Opinions, and being the only intelligible
account that can be given of the Worship of Images, we
have reason to believe, that the second Commandment,
which forbids the Worship of Images, had a principal regard
to it; but I have other Arguments from the Scripture it
self to confirm this Opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:53692:45"/>
1. The first is from the first Example of Image-worship
among the <hi>Israelites</hi> after the giving this Law; that is, the
Worship of the Golden Calf, which <hi>Aaron</hi> made while
<hi>Moses</hi> was in the Mount: That this Calf was intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a Symbolical Representation of the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and
that they worshipped the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the Worship of
this Calf, is so evident from the whole Story, that I confess
I do not think that Man fit to be disputed with, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
it; for he must either want Understanding, or Honesty,
to be convinced of the plainest matter, which he has no
mind to believe. The occasion of their making this Calf,
was the absence of <hi>Moses,</hi> who was a kind of a living Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and Divine Presence with them. They said to <hi>Aaron,
Vp,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>make us Gods, which shall go before us: for as for this</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<hi>the Man who brought us up out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>we
wot not what is become of him:</hi> So that they wanted not a new
God, but only a Divine Presence with them, since <hi>Moses,</hi>
who used to acquaint them with the Will of God, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
them by a Divine Spirit, was so long absent, that they
thought him lost; when the Calf was made, <hi>they said, These
be thy Gods, O Israel, which brought Thee out of the Land of
Egypt:</hi> Which they could not possibly understand of the
Calf, which was but then made. For tho we should think
them so silly, as to believe it to be a God, it was impossible
they should think that the Calf brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
before it self was made: Nor could they think any Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Gods delivered them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to the ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation
of their own Country; especially, since they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
knew, that it was only the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who brought
them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by the hand of <hi>Moses;</hi> and therefore
<hi>Aaron built an Altar before it, and proclaimed a Feast to the
Lord, or to Jehovah,</hi> as the word is: which makes it very
plain to any unprejudiced Man, that they intended to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the Worship of the Golden Calf,
which they made for a symbolical Representation and Presence
of God;<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfl.</hi> Defence of Disc. of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, p. 747, &amp;c</note> which no doubt was very agreeable to the notion
the Egyptians had of their Images, from whom they learn'd
this way of Worship; and I need not tell any Man how
displeasing this was to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:53692:45"/>
2. Another Argument of this, is, That Images are called
Gods in Scripture;<note place="margin">Isa. 44. 10, 15, 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Isa. 44. 10. Who hath fashioned a God, or
molten a Graven Image, which is profitable for nothing.—He
maketh a God and worshippeth it; he maketh it a Graven Image,
and falleth down thereto.—The residue thereof he maketh a
God, even his Graven Image, and worshippeth it, and prayeth
unto it, and saith, Deliver me, for thou art my God.</hi> I need not
multiply places for the proof of this; for this is own'd by all
the Advocates of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and relied on as the
great support of their Cause. From hence they say, it is
plain in what sense God forbids the Worship of Images, <hi>viz.</hi>
when Men worship their Images for Gods, as the Text asserts
the Heathens did. But tho the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> worships
Images, yet she does not worship them for Gods, but only
worship God, or Christ, or the Saints in and by their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
This is the reason of their great Zeal to make the
first and second Commandment but one: because the first
Commandment forbidding the Worship of all false Gods, If
that which we call the second Commandment, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
the Worship of Images, be reckoned only as part of the
first, then they think it plain in what sense the Worship of
Images is forbid <hi>viz.</hi> only as the Worship of false Gods;
and therefore those cannot be charged with the breach of
this Commandment, who do not believe their Images to be
Gods.</p>
               <p>Now besides what I have already said, to prove that the
Heathens did not believe the Images themselves to be Gods,
which is so sottish a Conceit, as no Man of common Sense
can be guilty of; I have several Arguments to prove, that
the Scripture does not understand it in this sense.</p>
               <p>1. The first is, That the Golden Calf is called <hi>Gods of
Gold, Exod.</hi> 32. 31. and yet it is evident, they did not believe
the Calf to be a God, but only a Symbol and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> whom they worshipped in the
Calf.</p>
               <p>2. The very name of an Image, which signifies a Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Representation of some other Being, is irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with such a Belief, that the Image it self is a God; that
the Image is that very God, whom it is made to represent;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53692:46"/>
which signifies, that the likeness of God, is that very God
whose likeness it is: Especially, when the Scripture, which
calls such Images Gods, calls them also the Images of their
Gods.</p>
               <p>Which is proof enough, that tho the Scripture calls Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
Gods, it does not understand it in that sense, that they
believe their material Images to be Gods: for it is a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to say, that the Image of <hi>Baal,</hi> is both their God
<hi>Baal,</hi> and his Image at the same time; for the Image is not
the thing it represents.</p>
               <p>3. The Arguments urged in Scripture against Images,
plainly prove, that they were not made to be Gods, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Representations of God. One Argument is, because they
saw no similitude of God when he spoke to them in <hi>Horeb</hi>
out of the midst of the Fire: another, that they can make no
likeness of Him.<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>To whom then will ye liken God, or what
likeness will ye compare to Him?—To whom then will ye liken
Me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 40. 18, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>or shall I be equal, saith the Holy One?</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
with the Philosophers at <hi>Athens; For as much then as
we are the Off-spring of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 17. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>we ought not to think the Godhead
to be like to Gold, and Silver, and Stone graven by Art, and Man's
Device.</hi> Now what do all these Arguments signify against
making a God? for if they can make a God, what matter is
it who their God be like, so he be a God? It is a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
against making any Image and Representation of
God, that it is impossible to make any thing like him; but
it is enough for a God to be like it self.</p>
               <p>In what sense then, you'l say, does the Scripture call Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
Gods? there is but one possible sense, that I know of,
and that is, that they are vicarious and substituted Gods;
that they are set up in God's place, to represent his Person,
and to receive our Worship in his name and stead, and so
are Gods by Office, tho not by Nature. They are visible
Representations of the Invisible God, they bear his Name
and receive his Worship; as the Golden Calf was called <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah,</hi>
and the Worship of the Calf was called a Feast un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord: And this is some reason for their being called
Gods; as the Proxy and Substitute acts in the name of the
Person he represents: Which proves that this is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53692:46"/>
notion of Image-worship, that the Image is worshipped in
God's name and stead. And to this purpose I observe, That
tho' <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or an Idol, signifies a false god; yet it signifies
such a false god as is only the image and figure of another
god; for so <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Tertul</hi> de Idolo. c. 4.</note>
Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, <hi>eorum imagines Idola, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginum
consecratio Idolatria.</hi> That their Images are Idols, and the
Consecration of them is Idolatry. Thus the Author of the
Book of Wisdom attributes the original of Idolatry,<note place="margin">Wisdom c 14. v. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>to Fathers
making images for their children who were dead, and appointing so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities
to be kept before them as if they were gods; and thus by
degrees Princes passed these things into Laws, and made men to
worship graven images; and thus either out of affection or flattery
the worship of Idols began.</hi> Which shews what he means by Idols,
Images consecrated for the worship of God. And therefore he
distinguishes the worship of Idols, from the worship of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and heavenly bodies,<note place="margin">c. 13. v. 6.</note> when this was done without an
Image: And therefore no God is in Scripture called an Idol, but
with respect to its Image. Thus Idols and Molten Gods are
join'd together,<note place="margin">Levit. 19. 4. Psalm. 13515.</note> as expounding each other. And the Psalmist
tells us, <hi>The Idols of the Heathens are Silver and Gold, the work
of mens hands.</hi> So that an Idol is a false God, as it signifies a
material Image made to represent some God, as a visible object
of worship, to receive the worship of that God whose name
it bears, in his place and stead.</p>
               <p>To the same purpose the Scripture charges these Image-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
with changing the Glory of God into the likeness and
similitude of those creatures whereby they represented him.
The <hi>Israelites</hi> made the Image of a Golden Calf, as the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
representation and presence of the Lord Jehovah; and
the Psalmist tells us, that by so doing, <hi>they changed their glory
(i. e.</hi> the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who was the glory of <hi>Israel) into the
similitude of an Ox which eateth grass.</hi> Which necessarily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
that they intended to represent the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the
image of the Calf; not that they thought their God to be like
the Calf, but as they made a vicarious and visible God of it,
and worshipped it in the name of the Lord <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Thus St.
<hi>Paul</hi> describes the Idolatry of the Heathens,<note place="margin">Rom 1. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>That they changed
the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible

man, and four footed beasts, and creeping things.</hi> But of
this more presently; this is sufficient to show, what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
notion of Image-worship is, and in what sense it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> Let us now consider wherein the evil of this Image-worship
consists. which will greatly contribute to the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of this whole dispute. Now the account of it in
general is very short and plain, That the evil of Image-worship
when we worship the true God by an Image, does not so much
consist in the kinds, or degrees, or object of worship, as in
representation; and if this prove the true account of it, as I
believe it will appear to be to all considering men, before I have
done, it will quite alter the state of this controversie, and put
M. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> and the Representer, to find out some new Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Representations of their Image-worship.</p>
               <p>1. That the evil of Image-worship when men worship the
true God by an Image, does not principally consist in the kinds,
or degrees, or object of worship. Such men indeed are said in
Scripture to worship Images, and Idols, and Molten Gods, and
that their Idols are silver and gold, wood and stone; for when
they worship God by an Image, they must worship the Image;
or else they cannot worship God in it, tho' they worship the
Image not for it self, but for the Prototype, as the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi> determines, which is more properly worshipping God or
Christ in or before his Image, as M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> expounds it, than
worshipping the Image; and they are said to worship Images
rather with respect to the manner than to the object of worship,
as you shall hear more presently. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> indeed,
as her doctrine and practice is expounded by her most famed
Divines, may justly be charged with worshipping Images in the
grossest sense; as that signifies giving Religious worship to the
material image of wood and stone; which is strictly to worship
stocks and stones as Gods. This charge may be easily made
good against all those who teach that the Image is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
worshipped, and that either a relative <hi>latria,</hi> or some
proper infer<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r worship is to be terminated on the Image as its
material object; and yet most of the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors atttibute
one or t'other to the Image, as distinct from that worship they
give to the Prototype; and dispute very learnedly, that this is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53692:47"/>
the Doctrine both of the second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> That a proper worship must be given to the
Image, distinct from that worship which is given to the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type;
but they cannot yet agree, whether it be a relative im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
analogical <hi>latria,</hi> which must be given to the Image of
Christ, or only <hi>dulia,</hi> or an inferiour degree of Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>This has hitherto been the chief seat of the Controversy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> about Image-worship; and M. <hi>de
Meaux</hi> seems very sensible, That attributing a proper worship
to Images, so as to terminate it on them, gives too just occasion
for the charge of Idolatry, and puts them to hard shifts to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
themselves from it; and therefore he owns no worship
due to the Image for it self, but only as it represents the Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type,
which therefore is not so properly the worship of the
Image, as of the Prototype by the Image; and here I perfectly
agree with him, That the true notion of Image-worship is not
to worship the Image at all, considered in it self, as a material
figure of Wood and Stone, but only to worship God or Christ
in the Image. And therefore I shall set aside this dispute, in
what sense, or how far a <hi>Papist</hi> may be charged with worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the material Image, which has occasioned eternal wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
and yet does not properly belong to the controversie of
Image-worship. To worship a material Image, is to give the
worship of God to Creatures, to Wood and Stone; but Image-worship
is in its strict notion, not giving Divine worship to Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
but worshipping God in and by the Image which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
him, which in Scripture is called worshipping Images:
And therefore tho we should grant, that M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
avoids the first charge of giving Religious worship to
Wood and Stone, because he denies that they properly worship
the Image, but only the Prototype in the Image; yet the
whole guilt of Image-worship, as that signifies the worship of
God by Images, not the worship of the material Image, is
chargeable upon him still, that is, the worship of the Prototype
by the Image, which is all that is forbid in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
               <p>This, it may be, will be thought a giving up the Cause, to
grant, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may worship God or Christ
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53692:48"/>
by Images, and yet not be chargeable with worshipping the
Images themselves, or the material figures of Wood or Stone;
and therefore it will be necessary to shew, that the true Notion
of Idolatry or Image-worship is not giving Religious worship to
the Images themselves, but worshipping God by Images, and
what the difference between these Two is.</p>
               <p>1. And the first thing I shall observe to this purpose, is the
difference between the First and Second Commandment, which
all <hi>Protestants</hi> own and defend against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which makes the Second Commandment only a Branch and
Appendix of the First. Now the First Commandment forbids
all false objects of worship, the worship of all creatures and ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Deities, and therefore the worship of all Beings besides
God, whether rational, animate or inanimate, is a breach of
the First Commandment, and must be reduced to it; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the Second Commandment which forbids the worship
of Images, cannot forbid them as false Objects, (for all such
are forbid in the first Commandment) but as a false and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
way of worship; and therefore Image worship as it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
in the Second Commandment, cannot signifie worshipping
the Image it self, as distinguished from the Prototype, for that
would make it a false object of worship against the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment;
but only a false and superstitious way of represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and worshipping God by an Image.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> And therefore I observe, that an Image does not alter the
object of worship, which yet it must necessarily do, if it were
Essential to the Notion of Image-worship to worshipt the Image
it self, which would make the Image a new object of worship.
Now it is plain, that men who do not dispute themselves into
endless subtilties and distinctions, intend no more in the worship
of Images, than to worship that God whose Image it is, and
therefore the object of worship is the same with or without an
Image. They who worship the True God with an Image, and
they who worship him without an Image, worship the same God
though in a different manner; and besides what judgment men
make of their own actions, and what they intend to do, the
Scripture it self acknowledges this. When the <hi>Israelites</hi> made a
golden Calf, <hi>Aaron</hi> proclaims a Feast to the Lord Jehovah, which
proves that they intended to worship the same God still in the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53692:48"/>
golden Calf, which they did before without it. Thus the Two
Calves which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> set up, were made in imitation of the
golden Calf, and for Symbolical representations of the God of
<hi>Israel,</hi> who was worshipped by them; For it is plain that <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
did not intend to change their God, but only to prevent
their going up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to worship God there; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he tells them, <hi>It is too much for you to go up to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
thy Gods,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 12. 28.</note> O Israel, <hi>which brought thee up out of the Land of
Aegypt;</hi> that is, the Lord Jehovah. Now we may observe, that
God himself, though he was grievously offended with the Sin of
<hi>Jeroboam,</hi> yet he makes a great difference between the Sin of
<hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the Sin of <hi>Ahab,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 16. 31, 32.</note> who introduced the worship of
<hi>Baal</hi> a false God, whereas <hi>Jeroboam</hi> retained the worship of the
true God, though he worshipped him in a false and Idolatrous
manner. If the Calves of <hi>Don</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> had been false Gods,
as <hi>Baal</hi> was, the Sin had been equally provoking; but the worship
of the Calves did not change their God, as the worship of <hi>Baal</hi>
did; and therefore <hi>Elijah</hi> distinguishes the <hi>Israelites</hi> into the
worshippers of God and of <hi>Baal. How long halt ye between Two
Opinions?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 King. 18, 21.</note> 
                  <hi>if the Lord be God, follow him; but if</hi> Baal, <hi>then follow
him;</hi> and yet most of those who are said to be worshippers of
God, did worship God at the Calves of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> which
was the established Religion of the Kingdom. And thus <hi>Jehu,</hi>
tho' he departed not from the Sin of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> the golden
Calves in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 10. 16.</note> yet he calls his Zeal in destroying
<hi>Baal</hi> out of <hi>Israel,</hi> his Zeal for the Lord Jehovah.</p>
               <p>Now if the worship of an Image do not change the object of
our worship, neither in the intention of the worshipper, nor in
the account of Scripture, as I have now proved, it evidently
follows, that the Image is not worshipped as an object, but as a
<hi>Medium</hi> of worship; it receives no worship for it self, but only
for God whom it represents. And that which is so offensive to
God in it, is not that they set up any Rival and Opposite gods
against him, but that they worship him in a reproachful and
dishonourable manner, which makes him abhor and reject the
worship; and because he will not receive this worship himself, he
calls it worshipping Idols and graven Images, and molten gods,
that is, vicarious and representative gods, which though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the worship in God's Name, yet are an infinite reproach
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53692:49"/>
to his Majesty by that vile and contemptible Representation they
make him. This is the strict Notion of Idolatry, not the giving
the worship of God to Creatures; which is the Breach of the
First Commandment in making new Gods, but the worship of
God by an Image, which makes such Images Gods by Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation,
but not the objects, but only the <hi>Medium</hi> of worship;
and therefore though we should grant M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> that he
does not worship Images, but only Christ and the Saints in or
before their Images, this does not excuse him from Idolatry,
which does not signifie worshipping an Image in a strict sence;
but only worshipping God in an Image, which terminates all
the worship not on the Image but on God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> Let us now consider wherein the Evil of this Idolatry or
Image-worship does consist; and that I said was in Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
which I shall briefly explain in these particulars. 1. That
it is an infinite reproach to the Divine Nature and Perfections, to
be represented by an Image:<note place="margin">Isa. 40. 18, 19, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>To whom will ye liken God? Or
what likeness will ye compare to him? The workman melteth a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-Image,
and the Goldsmith spreadeth it over with Gold, and
casteth Silver Chains. He that is so impoverished that he hath no
Oblation, chuseth a Tree that will not rot: he seeketh unto him a
cunning Workman to prepare a graven Image that shall not be
moved. Have ye not known? Have ye not heard? Hath it not
been told you from the beginning? Have ye not understood from the
Foundations of the Earth? It is he that sitteth upon the Circle of the
Earth, and the Inhabitants thereof are as Grashoppers; that stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
cut the Heavens as a Curtain, and spreadeth them out as a
Tent to dwell in.</hi> How incongruous and absurd is it, to make a
Picture or Image of that God who is invisible? to represent a
pure Mind by Matter, dull sensless Matter! to give the shape
and figure of a Man, or some viler Creature, to that God who
has none! To make an Image for the Maker of the World, and
to bring that Infinite Being to the scantlings and dimensions of a
Man, who fills Heaven and Earth with his presence! If it be
the Glory of God to be what he is, a pure, infinite, eternal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Mind! it is a contradiction and dishonour to him to be
represented by a material visible Image like to some of his own
Creatures, but inferior to the meanest living Creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
without Life and Sense: Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues, <hi>Acts 17. 29.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53692:49"/>
Forasmuch then as we are the off-spring of God, we ought not to
think that the Godhead is like unto Gold or Silver, or Stone gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by art, and mans device.</hi> If we think God to be like to such
Images, we know nothing of him; and if we make such Images
as we know are not like to God, nay a reproach to his Nature
and Perfections, we wilfully affront him. And tho Christ
conversed in this World in human Nature, which is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
by an Image, yet an Image is not a proper Representation
of Christ, as the object of Worship, because it cannot repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Divine Nature, which is the Reason and Foundation of
Worship. And as for Saints, they ought not to be worshipped
at all, and therefore not worshipped by Images: And indeed,
that very Law which forbids the worship of Images without
any Exception, and yet upon such Reasons as are peculiar to
the infinite Nature of God, are a plain Argument to me, that
no Being which is representable by human Art, is an Object of
Worship.</p>
               <p>2. To set up an Image in the place of God, has a great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
and suspicion of worshipping a material and visible
God, of giving Divine Honours to Gold and Silver, and the
work of mens hands; for the men pretend to Worship God in
the Image, yet how does the Image come to be worshipped
for God? What likeness? What Relation is there between them?
How easily may men slip into the worship of Images themselves,
and forsake God, or never mind him, for the sake of a fine Picture,
or some beautiful or wonder-working Image? for tho there is a
great deal of difference between worshipping God by an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and worshipping the Image it self, yet to all appearance
they are so like one another, and there is so easie a passage from
one to the other, that Gods displeasure against this Sin is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in Scripture by Jealousie; a Passion which expresses both
Suspicion and Caution; while they profess to Worship God by
their Images, they do not change their God, but yet their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
a visible Image, looks very like it, and is an easie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
to it. Thus in the second Commandment, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
with which God inforces his Prohibition against worshipping
Images is, <hi>For I the Lord thy God, am a Jealous God.</hi> Thus Psal. 78.
58. <hi>for they provoked him to anger with their high places, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him to jealousie with their graven Images.</hi> And therefore he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53692:50"/>
himself with some Passion and Concernment in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>I am: he Lord, that is my Name, and my Glory will I not
give to another, neither my Praise to Graven Images,</hi> Isa. 42. 8.
The Church is called Gods Spouse, and the worship of false
gods is called Woredom and Adultery, going after other gods;
and the worship of the true God by Images, tho it be not
Whoredom, yet it is such a kind of spiritual Wantonness and
Incontinency, as excites his Jealousie</p>
               <p>3. Especially when we consider, that the Worship of Images
does naturally expose us to the Cheats and Impostures of wicked
Spirits; for this reason I observed before, God fordids the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of any other Invisible Being but himself; for it men were
allowed to Worship inferior Spirits, bad Spirits who inhabit
these lower Regions, would soon have the greatest share in their
Worship; and thus it is with Images, which are such an offence
and dishonour to God, that we cannot expect that he will ever
show himself present in them, or guard them from the possession
of evil Spirits. It is evident that in the Heathen World, evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
possessed their Images, and abused mankind with their lying
Wonders, and lying Oracles; and I have some reason to believe,
that if any Miracles are wrought still at Images, they are not
by good Spirits, because Images are an Abomination to God;
and therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. St. <hi>Paul</hi> attributes the general corruption
of mens lives and manners to the Worship of Images; <hi>They
changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like
to corruptible man, and to birds and fourfooted beasts, and creeping
things; wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness—for this cause
God gave them up to vile affections—and even as they did not like
to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate
mind to do these things which are not convenient.</hi> The meaning of
which is, That God gave them over to the delusions of wicked
Spirits, who lurked in their Images, and first corrupted their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and then their Lives by impure and barbarous Rites of
Worship.</p>
               <p>4. If there were no other hurt in Image-worship, yet it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bases
human Nature to fall down before a sensless Image: As it
is a dishonour to God to be worshipped by an Image, tho the
Worship be intended for himself, and not for the Image, because
it makes so mean and vile Representation of him; so it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53692:50"/>
to a man, who is a reasonable Creature, and made after
the Image of God, to fall down before Stocks and Stones, with
all external Submissions and Adorations, tho he intends not to
worship the material Image, but God by it; because the visible
Object before which we pay our Worship, is so much below the
honour and dignity of humane Nature, is a reproach to the
understanding of a man to think that a material Image is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Representation of God, and a fit medium of Worship;
and he must have a mean and beggarly Spirit, who can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to bow down before it: Thus <hi>Arnobius</hi> aggravates the
madness of this:<note place="margin">Arnob. l. 6.</note> Supplicare tremebundum facttitatae abs te rei;
<hi>To fall down trembling, and to supplicate that which thou thy self
hast made.</hi> And a greater than <hi>Arnobius</hi> tell us, <hi>They that make
them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 135. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>are like unto them, so is every one who putteth their trust in
them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>5ly.</hi> The Worship of God by Images is contrary not only to
the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> but to the reason of Mankind; it gratifies indeed
a fleshly and sensual Mind to have a visible Object of Worship,
but God is the only natural Object of Worship; and reason tells
us, that God is invisible; and Reason will tell us, that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the nature of an invisible Being, to be worshipped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a visible Representation; it is not only a Reproach to the
Divine Nature, but an absurd and unreasonable Worship. For
what considering man can think it reasonable to worship a visible
Image instead of an invisible God? Reason can never justifie
a worship so contradictory to the Divine Nature, and therefore
Reason can never teach men to Worship an Image. For what
is it they intend by worshipping Images? Have they a mind
to see the God they Worship? But how unreasonable is this,
when they know he is invisible, and would not be a God if he
could be seen? And how absurd is it to Represent him by an
Image, when they know they can make no Image like him?
No worship can be natural, which contradicts the nature of
that Being whom we Worship; and if it be not natural, it must
be instituted Worship; and then, tho it were forbid by no Law,
it must be commanded by some Law to make it reasonable, at
least if it be possible that a Law could make that an act of
Honour and Worship, which is a Dishonour to the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:53692:51"/>
                  <hi>6ly.</hi> It is more especially contrary to the nature of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
worship, which teaches us to form a more spiritual Idea
of God, and to worship him in Spirit and in Truth; in opposition
not only to all sensible Representations, but to all symbolical
Presences. There are two things principally, for which Images
are intended, to be visible Representations, and a visible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Deity. The first of these is so great a Reproach to
the Divine Nature, that it was forbid by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi>
which was at best a less perfect Dispensation, as being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated
to the carnal State of that people; but as to the second,
God himself gratified them in it, for he dwelt among them in
the Tabernacle, and afterwards in the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
where he placed the Symbols of his Presence. But now when
the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> asked our Saviour about the place of
Worship, whether it was the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or <hi>Samaria:</hi>
He answers,<note place="margin">Joh 4. 21, 23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>The hour cometh when ye shall neither in this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
nor yet at</hi> Jerusalem <hi>worship the Father. But the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
shall worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth, for the
Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit, and they that
worship him, must worship him in Spirit and in Truth.</hi> Where
Christ opposes worshipping in Spirit and in Truth, to worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in the Temple, not as a Temple signifies a place separated
for Religious Worship, which is a necessary Circumstance of
Worship in all Religions; but as it signifies a Symbolical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
a Figure of Gods Residence and Dwelling among them,
in which sense the Primitive Christians denied that they had
any Temples. For God dwelling in human Nature, is the only
Divine Presence under the Gospel, of which the Temple was but
a Type and Figure. Now if the spiritual Worship of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
does so withdraw us from sense, as not to admit of a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical
Presence, much less certainly does it admit of Images,
to represent God present to us, which is so gross and carnal, that
God forbad it under the Legal Dispensation. We must consider
God as an infinite Mind, present in all places to hear our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and receive our Worship, and must raise our hearts to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
whither Christ who is the only visible Presence of God is
ascended, and not seek for him in carved Wood or Stone, or a
curious piece of Painting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:53692:51"/>
                  <hi>7ly.</hi> But since M. <hi>de Maux,</hi> and the Representer think it
sufficient to justifie the worship of Images, that they are of
great use to represent the object of our worship to us, and to
affect us with suitable passions; it will be needful briefly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
this matter. For I confess I cannot see how a material
and visible Image should form a true Idea in us of an invisible
Spirit; it is apt to corrupt mens notions of God and Religion,
and to abate our just reverence, by representing the object of
our worship under so contemptible an appearance. An Image
cannot tell us what God is; if we are otherwise instructed in
the nature of God, we know that an image is not like him, but
a reproach to the Divine perfections; if we are not better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
we shall think our God like his image, which will
make us very understanding Christians.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Representer</hi> has drawn this Argument out at large,
and therefore we must consider what he says of it. That Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
and Images serve to, 1. <hi>Preserve in his mind the memory
of the things represented by them, as people are wont to preserve
the memory of their deceased Friends by keeping their Pictures.</hi> But
I beseech you, the memory of what does a Picture preserve?
Of nothing that I know of, but the external lineaments and
features of the face or body; and therefore the Images and
Pictures of God and the Holy Trinity (which yet are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> cannot serve this end, unless they
will say, that God has an external shape as Man has. And
suppose we had the exact Pictures of Christ and the Virgin
<hi>Mary,</hi> the Apostles and other Saints and Martyrs, this might
gratifie our curiosity, but of what use is it in the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion?
To remember Christ, is not to remember his face, which
we never saw, but to remember his Doctrine and his Life; to
call to mind his great Love in dying for us; to remember him
not as a Man, but as a God incarnate, as our Mediator and
Advocate, as our Lord and Judge; and therefore the Gospel;
which contain the History of his Life, are a much better Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of Christ, than any drawn by the most curious Pencil;
and I doubt, the Christian Religion will not gain much by taking
the Gospels out of peoples hands, and giving them a Picture to
gaze on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:53692:52"/>
Yes, says our Author, 2. <hi>He is taught to use them by casting
his eye upon the Pictures or Images, and thence to raise his heart to
the Prototypes, and there to imploy it in Meditation, Love, Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
Imitation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as the object requires.</hi> But he is a very
sorry Christian, who never thanks of Christ, but when he sees
his Picture. And how can the sight of a Picture raise our
hearts to the Love of Christ? The sight indeed of a lovely
Picture may exci<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e a sensible passion, but not a Divine Love;
The sight of his Picture can only put us in mind, that there was
such a person as Christ in the world; but if we would affect
our hearts with his love and praise, we must not gaze on his
Face, which is all that a Picture can show us, if it could do
that, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> meditate on what he has done and suffered for us,
which may be done better without a Picture, than with it. If
they want something to put them in mind, that there is such a
person as Christ, which is all that his Picture can do, the name
of Christ written upon the Church Walls would be more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and altogether as effectual to this end.</p>
               <p>But Pictures are very instructive, as that of <hi>a Deaths head</hi>
and <hi>Old Time painted with his F<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rel<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ck, Hour-glass, and Sythe;
and do inform the mind at one glance, of what in reading requires
a Chapter, and sometimes a Volume;</hi> Which is so far from being
true, that a Picture informs a Man of nothing, but what he
was informed of before. The Picture of a Crucifix may put
a man in Mind of what he has heard or read of Christs dying
upon the Cross; but if he know nothing of the History of
Christs Sufferings, the bare seeing a Crucifix can teach him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Children may be taught by Pictures, which make a
more strong impression on their fancies than Words; but a
Picture cannot teach; and at best this is but a very childish way
of learning.</p>
               <p>3. But devout Pictures are of great use in Prayer, the sight
of which cures distractions, and <hi>recals his wandering thoughts
to the right object, and as certainly brings some good things into his
mind, as an immodest Picture disturbs his heart with naughtiness.</hi>
But can men read their Prayers, as well as learn the Articles of
their Creed, in a Picture too? For even good thought are a
distraction in Prayers, when they call us from attending to
what we ask of God; and it is to be feared then, that Pictures
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53692:52"/>
themselves may distract us, unless we are sure they will sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
no thoughts to us at such a time, but what are in our
Prayers; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> indeed teaching her Children
such Prayers as they do not understand, and therefore cannot
imploy their thoughts, may make Pictures very necessary to
entertain them; but if our thoughts and our words ought to go
together, as it must be if the Devotion of Prayers consists in
praying devoutly, an Image which cannot speak, and a Prayer
which is not understood, are like to make Men equally devout;
should Men when they look upon a Cruci fix, run over in their
Minds all the History of our Saviours Sufferings! should the
sight of our Saviour hanging on the Cross affect us with some
soft and tender Passions at the remembrance of him! (which it
is certain the daily and familiar use of such Pictures cannot do)
yet what is this to Prayer? Such sensible Passions as the sight
of a Picture can raise in us, are of little or no account in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
true devout Affections must spring from an inward
Vital Sense, which the Picture cannot give to those who want
it, and is of no use to those who have it.</p>
               <p>Thus I have, as briefly as the Subject would permit examined
the Doctrine of Praying to Saints, and Worshipping Images
according to the Exposition of the Bishop of <hi>Cond<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>m,</hi> to whom
our Author appeals in these Points, and this I hope will satisfie
him, what we think both of the Bishops Authority and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and how little we like Popery in its best dress. And now
it is time to return to our Protester.</p>
               <p>And I hope by this time he sees that there is something more
needful to clear the Matters in Controversie between us, than
barely M. <hi>de Meax</hi> his Authority; and therefore he resolving
<hi>not to look beyond the Exposition delivered by this Prelate,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Papists</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 27.</note> I might
here very fairly take my leave of him; but I cannot do this, tho'
he be a perfect Stranger to me, without dismissing him civilly
with a Complement or two more.</p>
               <p>1. Then as to the <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> he observes that
I deny the Bishop has limited it only to their Prayers,
which I own is a mistake; and this is such a Complement
as must never be expected from a Doctor of the infallible
Church, for he had occasion enough for it, had he had a Heart
to do it; but I hope I have abundantly made amends for this
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53692:53"/>
now by a fair and particular Examination of the Bishops Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
as to that Point; and indeed M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> himself gave
the occasion for this, by not owning it in its due place, when he
expounded the Decree of the Council, which teaches them to
fly to the aid and assistance of the Saints as well as to their
Prayers, but shuffling it into the middle of a sentence at some
distance, where no Man would expect it: When Expositors
dodge at this rate, they may thank themselves if they are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken.</p>

to justifie his renouncing <hi>the Popes personal Infallibility,
and the deposing Doctrine,</hi> as no Articles of Faith: But tho' the
Bishop indeed do wave <hi>some things,</hi> as he says, <hi>which are disputed
of in the Schools,</hi> as no Articles of Faith, yet he does not say
what they are, much less name <hi>the Popes personal Infallibility,
and the deposing power;</hi> and one would think he could not mean
the <hi>deposing power,</hi> which is determined by General Councils,
and therefore must be an Article of Faith. The Truth is, the
Bishop has here plaid a very cunning Game, and men may
make what they please of his words, as their interest or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
leads them; if <hi>Protestants</hi> object the Doctrine of the
Popes infallibility and Deposing power, he can easily tell them
that these are School disputes, and not Articles of Faith; if the
Pope or <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors quarrel at it, he has then said nothing
in disparagement of the Popes infallibility and Deposing power,
but has taught that Fundamental Principle on which these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
depend, as in Truth he has, when he makes the Primacy
of <hi>Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exposition</note> the Cement of Unity, and gives this Primacy to the
Bishops of <hi>Rome, as Successors of the Prince of the Apostles, to
whom for this cause we owe that Obedience and Submission which
the holy Councils and Fathers have always taught the Faithful;</hi>
though they have not said one word till of late of any such obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and submission due to them; especially when we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what he means by the Primacy of the Pope, that he is <hi>a
Head established by God to conduct his whole Flock in his paths;</hi>
which gives him a Supremacy over bishops and Secular Princes;
and how naturally this infers infallibilty, and a power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Heretical Princes, every one sees, and we have reason to
believe the Bishop expounded his Doctrine to this Orthodox
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53692:53"/>
Sence in his Letters to the Pope, from the Popes Testimonial,
<hi>that his Letters shewed his submission and respect to the Apostolick
See.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Popes personal infallibility, our Author in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
(p 8.) denies it to be an Article of Faith, because it is <hi>not
positively determined by any General Council;</hi> in my reply (p. 47.)
I told him this is no proof, that it is not an Article of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the infallibility of the Church it self, which they all grant
to be an Article of Faith, was never positively determined by
any General Council; and therefore some Doctrines may be
Articles of Faith, which never were determined by any Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council; and I added, that if the Church be infallible, the
Pope must, if he be the Head of the Church; <hi>for infallibility
ought in reason to accompany the greatest and most absolute Power;</hi>
but our Author thought fit to let fall this dispute, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
all into the Bishop of <hi>Condoms</hi> Authority.</p>
               <p>His Proposal which follows, I have already answered without
a smile, but I cannot forbear smiling once more to hear him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of disputing; which he says <hi>belongs not to the Representer,
who being to represent and not to dispute,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 3<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>is not concerned with those
tedious Arguments.</hi> The Case is this; In the Character of a
Papist Represented, he had denied the deposing Power to be an
Article of Faith; the Answerer proved it was an Article of Faith,
because it was decreed by General Councils; to this, in his Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
he answers, that every thing approved in General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
is not an Article of Faith, but only Doctrinal Points, and
those decreed with an <hi>Anathema;</hi> and therefore the Deposing
Power not being declared as a doctrinal point, and the decrees
relating only to Discipline and Government, and not being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
neither with an <hi>Anathema,</hi> it does not appear to be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Faith: In Answer to this, in my Reply <hi>(p. 49)</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
three Enquiries, 1. <hi>Whether nothing be an Article of Faith,
but what is decreed with an Anathema? 2. Whether the deposing
Decree be a doctrinal Point, or only matter of Discipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
3. What Authority general Councils have in</hi> decretis morum,
<hi>or such matters as concern Discipline and Government?</hi> This is the
disputing he complains of, and I confess he has some reason for
it; for Arguments that cannot be answered, how short soever
they are, are very tedious; but how I could answer his argument
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53692:54"/>
without disputing, or how he comes to be unconcerned to defend
his own arguments, I cannot tell; but tho disputing is not his
Province, <hi>yet in civility he will go out of his way with me,</hi> and in
Civility I will keep him company.</p>
               <p>1. He confesses, <hi>I prove at large that all definitions of Faith
declared in General Councils are not concluded with Anathema's, and
in this he willingly agrees with me. But this does not at all prove,
that whatsoever is declared in such a Council without an</hi> Anathema,
<hi>is an Article of Faith; and therefore nothing against us deserving
any farther answer.</hi> And thus he has very prettily altered the
state of the question; he said the Deposing doctrine tho appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by General Councils, was not an Article of Faith, because
not decreed with an <hi>Anathema:</hi> now if this argument be good,
then nothing must be accounted an Article of Faith, but what
is decreed with an <hi>Anathema:</hi> in opposition to which I proved
that several Doctrines which they themselves account Articles
of Faith, have been decreed by general Councils without <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's;</hi>
and he grants that I have proved this; and if I have, I
am sure his argument is lost, for then the deposing Doctrine
may be an Article of Faith, tho it be not confirmed with an
<hi>Anathema:</hi> and now instead of proving, that no Doctrine is an
Article of Faith which is not decreed with an <hi>Anathema,</hi> he
complains that I have not proved that every Doctrine which is
decreed without an <hi>Anathema,</hi> is an Article of Faith, which is
nothing at all to the purpose: We knew not where to find the
Articles of the <hi>Romish</hi> Faith, but in the decrees of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils;
and finding the Popes power to depose heretical Princes
there, we took it for an Article of their Faith: no, says the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecter,
that is a mistake, it is no Article of Faith, because it is
not decreed with an <hi>Anathema:</hi> we examine the matter, and
find it otherwise, that Articles of Faith are decreed without <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's:</hi>
yes, says the Protester, this may be, but you must
prove still that every Doctrine which is decreed <hi>without an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi>
is an Article of Faith; which is a very easie matter to do
after this; for if being decreed with or without an <hi>Anathema,</hi>
make no distinction as to this matter, then the Decree it self in
doctrinal Points must make an Article of Faith; if some Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
which are acknowledged to be Articles of the <hi>Romish</hi>
Faith are decreed without <hi>Anathema's,</hi> then it is no argument
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53692:54"/>
against any Doctrine, being an Article of Faith, that it has no
<hi>Anathema</hi> annexed to it; so that our Author is wonderful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
what to call an Article of Faith; if we call the decrees
of their Councils Articles of their Faith, No, says he, every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
is not an Article of Faith, but only what is decreed with
an <hi>Anethema;</hi> if we confute this distinction, and prove that
Articles of Faith are decreed without <hi>Anathema's,</hi> then he can
distinguish no further; but requires us to prove, that every
Doctrine decreed without an <hi>Anethema</hi> is an Article of Faith,
that is, that the decree of their Church makes an Article of
their Faith: And if that don't, I would desire to know of him,
what does. And had I not reason then to say, <hi>that it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hard to know what their Faith is,</hi> when he himself cannot
tell what it is that makes an Article of Faith, and their most
Learned Divines so much differ about this matter; some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
that to be an Article of Faith, which others reject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> The second enquiry was, Whether the Deposing decree
be a Doctrinal point, or only matter of Discipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and in answer to this I told him, <hi>That a Decree what
shall be done, includes a virtual Definition of that Doctrine on
which that Decree is founded.</hi> To this he opposes what I say
under the next head, <hi>That in the Council of the Apostles at</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
<hi>there was a Decree of Manners, yet it contained no Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Doctrine.</hi> Not expresly indeed, but virtually it does, as I
said before. My business there, was to vindicate the Authority
of Councils in those Decrees which relate to Manners, as not
less Obligatory than the Decrees of Faith; and I observed that
the only Apostolical Council we have an account of in Scripture,
<hi>Viz.</hi> the Council at <hi>Jerusalem, Acts</hi> 15. was of this nature;
for the only Decrees made in it, were <hi>to abstain from Meats
offered to Idols, and from Blood, and from things Strangled,
and from Fornication;</hi> and I observed, they might as well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
here, (to invalidate this Decree) as they do against the
Deposing Decree, that there is no point of Doctrine determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in it. And how does this contradict what I before as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted?
<hi>That a Decree what shall be done, includes a virtual
Definition of that Doctrine on which that Decree is founded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however he saies, <hi>This Decree of what was to be done, did
not include a virtual Definition of that Doctrine on which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53692:55"/>
was founded; for if it had, then the Doctrine of abstaining
from Blood and Strangled meats, had been an Article of Faith.</hi>
But what does he think of <hi>abstaining from Fornication, and from
Meats offered to Idols,</hi> which are contained in the same Decree?
is not that a necessary Doctrine, and virtually contained in that
Decree? I never said, That every Decree of Manners must
be immediately founded on an Article of Faith: but I said,
every Decree of Manners is founded on some Doctrine,
(whether it be in a strict sense an Article of Faith, or not)
and includes a virtual Definition of that Doctrine. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
to abstain from Fornication includes this Doctrine, that
Fornication is unlawful under the Gospel; and the Decree
for Gentile Converts to abstain from meats offered to Idols, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the same; and the Decree to <hi>abstain from Blood,</hi> and <hi>from
things Strangled,</hi> includes this doctrinal Definition, That it was
unlawful for <hi>Gentile</hi> Christians at that time to use their Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Liberty in those matters, to the offence and scandal of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Jews.</hi> The matter in short is this: Every Decree which
commands the doing any thing, must contain a virtual Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that such a thing may be lawfully done: and every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
which forbids the doing any thing, does withal define, that
such a thing is either absolutely unlawful in it self, or highly
inexpedient, and therefore unlawful in such Circumstances to
be done: this is as necessary as it is to command nothing but
what is lawful, and to forbid nothing but what is either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
or highly inexpedient And therefore when the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> Decrees the deposing Heretical Princes, or the favourers
of Hereticks: She virtually defines, that it is lawful to depose
Princes, which is a doctrinal Definition, and may in a large sense
be called an Article of Faith, as that signifies all Doctrinal points
proposed to us to be believed, as I observed in my Reply <hi>(p. 50).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The third Enquiry was, Whether the Authority of the
Church be not as sacred in decrees of Manners, as in Articles of
Faith? for the proof of which, I urged the Council at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and shew'd, <hi>That Rules of Discipline and Government to direct
the lives and manners of men, is the only proper subject of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Authority,</hi> P. 55. And here where he should have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the Council of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he says nothing of it, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
says, <hi>(p. 32.)</hi> that I <hi>urge out of</hi> Canus <hi>and</hi> Bellarmine, <hi>that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53692:55"/>
General Councils cannot err even in such decrees, when they relate to
things necessary to salvation, and which concern the whole Church.
And when I have proved the Deposing Decree to be of this nature, and
esteemed as such by their Church, I may then deserve a farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</hi>
What their Church will esteem, if he may be the
Expounder of it, is nothing to the purpose, for we argue not
from their private <hi>esteeming,</hi> but from their publick Definitions;
and if a General Decree for the government of the whole
Church, concern the whole Church, and if to command a sin
concerns mens salvation, then the Deposing decree does; for if
it be unlawful to depose Heretical Princes, it is more than a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
sin to do it: and if they will grant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that General Councils
cannot command a sin, then they must grant, that it is lawful
to depose Heretical Princes: and I agree with him, that this
does deserve a farther Consideration, and shall be glad to hear
his thoughts of it.</p>
               <p>This Author in his Reflections <hi>(p. 10.)</hi> proves that Popes
themselves own, that the <hi>deposing power</hi> is no Article of Faith, <hi>in
letting so many open and positive asserters of the no-deposing power
pass without any censure of heresie.</hi> This in my Reply <hi>(p. 57.)</hi> I
attribute <hi>to their want of power. For Princes will not be deposed
now, nor suffer those to be censured who deny the deposing Power.</hi> This
in his protestation <hi>(p. 32.)</hi> he says, <hi>Is spoke like an Oracle,</hi> but
<hi>he expects some better Argument than my bare assurance of what the
Pope would do if he had power.</hi> And I thought I had given him
a better argument than my bare word for it, <hi>viz.</hi> the experience
of former Ages, what Popes did when they had power: for tho
the infallible Chair may dissemble a little, when circumstances
of affairs require it, yet sure it is not given to change.</p>
               <p>What follows about the worship of Saints and Images, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
has been sufficiently answered already, but I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
a very pleasant argument he has against what I assert, <hi>That
no intention can alter the nature of actions, which are determined
by a divine or human Law.</hi> Whereby I prove, that if they do
such things, as in the account of the Divine Law are idolatrous,
their intention not to commit Idolatry will not excuse them:
This he says <hi>(p. 36.) a Quaker might as reasonably make use of
for the justifying his yea's and his nay's, and his other points of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerism.</hi>
For if he should say, <hi>No intention can alter the nature of
actions, which are determined by a divine or human law, but Swear
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53692:56"/>
not at all, neither be ye called Masters; and let your communication
be yea, yea, nay, nay, are actions or things determined by the divine
law, therefore the intention of doing no evil in them, cannot excuse
the d<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing otherwise than is there determined, from the guilt of sin.</hi> But
will our Protester say, that the Divine Law does forbid all swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
then I grant that the Quakers are in the right, and no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
will justifie swearing; but St. <hi>James</hi> must be expounded
so as to reconcile his words with other passages in Scripture,
which allow of swearing; and could he show us where bowing,
and kissing, and kneeling, and praying before an Image is in any
sence allow'd in Scripture, then we would grant also, that the
direction of the intention would justifie such a use of these acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as the Scripture allows: but what is absolutely forbid to be
done, no intention can excuse, which is our present case here.
He concludes all with two or three Requests, which must be
briefly consider'd.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>That he</hi> (the Replier) <hi>will use his interest with Protestants,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 37.</note>
                  <hi>to hold to what he saies they do, ond charge us with nothing but what
we expresly profess to Believe and Practice.</hi> Now I can assure him
there is no need of using my interest with Protestants to do this,
for I hope they are naturally inclined to to be honest: but there
are so many <hi>us</hi>'s among them, that possibly some Protestants
may mistake one <hi>us</hi> for another. They practice indeed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
much alike, but they believe differently, and they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
differently, and they expound the Doctrine of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
differently; and I hope Protestants may without any offence
say how and wherein they differ, and I think we cannot be justly
charged with misrepresenting, while we relate matter of Fact
truly, what their practice is, and what their different sentiments
and opinions are about these matters.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That they</hi> (Protestants) <hi>pick not up the abuses of some,
the vices and cruelties of others, the odd opinions of particular
Authors, and hold these forth for the Doctrines and Practices of our
Church; and that in charging any practises, they charge no more
than are concerned.</hi> Now this is very reasonable, if he speaks
of such <hi>abuses</hi> as are not allowed and countenanced by the
Church; and of such <hi>cruelties</hi> as are not practised, encouraged,
commended by the Governours of the Church, and justified
by the Decrees and Canons of Popes and Councils; or of such
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53692:56"/>
                  <hi>odd opinions of particular Authors,</hi> as steal into the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
publick authority, and are censured as soon as they are
known; but as far as the Church gives any countenance and
authority to such <hi>abuses, cruelties, odd opinions,</hi> I see no reason
why Protestants may not complain of these things, and charge
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with them, and not like that Church ever
the better, which suffers such abuses, and applauds such cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties,
as <hi>Papists</hi> themselves, who have not put off all humanity,
cannot but abhor.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>That as often as they tell, what they think of our Doctrines
and Practices, they would likewise at the same time inform their
hearers, that those thoughts are, as the Replier says, Opinions,
Interpretations, and Consequences of their own concerning our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and not our avowed Doctrine.</hi> But this is a very needless
caution, as I observed before; for our people do not think,
that the <hi>Papists</hi> themselves believe all that ill of their own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and Practises which we charge them with; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
easily see, how our disputing against the Doctrines and
Practices of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and answering the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whereby they justify themselves, should betray people
into such a mistake; for it is no natural proof, that two men
are of the same mind because they dispute against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the Protester. And to conclude the whole, I
shall give my Readers a short view of the whole progress of
this dispute, that they may see what shuffling Adversaries we
have to deal with.</p>
               <p>When the Book entituled, <hi>A Papist Misrepresented and Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,</hi>
was exposed to publick view, and mightily applauded
by those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, and industriously dispersed,
and earnestly recommended to the perusal of <hi>Protestants,</hi> a
very learned and charitable hand undertook to make a true
representation of the Doctrines and Practises of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which he performed with such full and plain evidence,
that the <hi>Misrepresenter</hi> hath not so much as attempted to charge
him with any one false Citation, nor to show in any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
that he has misrepresented their Doctrines and Practises;
but instead of this, in his Reflections on the Answer (if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecter
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53692:57"/>
and Misrepresenter be the same person, as he owns
himself to be) he makes fresh complaints of <hi>Protestants</hi> misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
<hi>Papists;</hi> which if it had been true, is no confutation
of that representation which the Answerer had made of <hi>Popery;</hi>
The question then was, Whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes
and practises, as the Answerer says she does, and proves by
unquestionable authorities that she does. But this was too
plainly proved, to be a question any longer, and therefore he
rather chose to debate that general question about the Rules of
Representing, and how we must know what is the Faith of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and whether the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
have not a sufficient authority given to it by the Pope
and Cardinals, and Bishops of <hi>France,</hi> and what the authority
of private Doctors is, and the like; but has not in any one
particular shown wherein the Answerer has misrepresented
them, that the authorities he alledges are not good, that he
has put any forced and unnatural sense upon the words of their
Council, or Catechism, or Doctors, or that their Church has
by any publick acts contradicted what he charges to be her
Doctrine or Practise. This he has not done, and therefore we
have reason to believe this he could not do, and this is reason
enough to conclude, that the Answer contains a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation
of the Doctrines and Practises of the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I did not think such Reflections as these worth the notice of
the Learned Answerer, and therefore undertook to reply to
them my self, and particularly examined every thing he had
said; in return to this, he publishes another Answer, which he
calls <hi>Papists Protesting against Protestant Popery;</hi> and I thought it
would come to bare <hi>protesting</hi> at last, for his Reason and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
run very low before; this I have now considered, and I
think have not suffered any thing to escape without an answer;
but that the Reader may the better understand what a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Adversary this is, I shall briefly compare the Reply with
his Answer, and then leave him to judg of the ingenuity and
honesty of the Protester.</p>
               <p>In answer to his fresh complaint of Misrepresenting, in my
Reply I considered what it is to Misrepresent, <hi>viz.</hi> To charge
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53692:57"/>
them with such Doctrines and Practises as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
d<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sowns; and proved from his own Character of a <hi>Papist</hi> Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
that we are no Misrepresenters; for what he makes us
charge them with believing and doing, in the <hi>Character of a Papist
Misrepresented,</hi> that he owns and defends in the <hi>Character of a
Papist Represented;</hi> and the only difference in most Cases be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
these two <hi>Characters</hi> is this, That in the <hi>Character of a
Papist Misrepresented</hi> he puts in all the ill things which <hi>Protestants</hi>
say of their Faith and Worship, and in the <hi>Character of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist
Represented</hi> he says all the good things he can of it; but
this I told him does not belong to Representation, but Dispute,
and therefore whatever guilt we charge their Doctrines and
Practises with, this is not to misrepresent, while we charge
them with nothing but what is their Faith and Practise; to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
in this sense is only to report matter of fact; and he
who reports truly, cannot misrepresent. If we charge them
with any guilt, which they think they are not chargeable with,
this becomes matter of dispute; and it is not enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
such a charge, to tell the World, that they do not believe
so ill of their own Doctrines and Practises as we <hi>Protestants</hi> do.
By this Rule I examined the Thirty seven particulars of his <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>
and carefully distinguished between matters of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
and dispute, and all this he grants, and yet in his
Answer falls a protesting against <hi>Protestant Popery,</hi> as if we had
made a new Religion for them; whereas we only tell them
what the faults of their Religion is; and this he calls <hi>Protestant
Popery,</hi> That is, the judgment of <hi>Protestants</hi> concerning <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;</hi>
and this he <hi>protests</hi> against, which is a much easier way
than to confute it.</p>
               <p>And now instead of defending his own <hi>Characters,</hi> wherein
he had charged us with misrepresenting <hi>Papists,</hi> and which I
had proved, and he in effect granted to be no misrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
he seeks about to find out some new <hi>Protestant</hi> Misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenters,
and fills up several Pages with Citations out of the
Manual of <hi>John</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sutcliff,</hi> and others.
Now in the first place he ought to have shown, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
between matters of representation and dispute, by
which I answer'd his own Characters, will not justify these
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53692:58"/>
Misrepresenters also, as most certainly it will, and a Hundred
more if he can find them; but he saies not one word of this,
but only cites their words, and calls it misrepresenting. But
besides this, he has used very foul play to make Misrepresenters
of them; The Archbishop only transcribes out of Popish Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and cites his authorities; the Protester sets all down as
the Archbishops words, without letting his Reader know that
<hi>Papists</hi> teach these things, and that the Archbishop only repeats
them after them. But besides concealing the Popish authorities
to which they refer, he has taken another course with Mr. <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliff,</hi>
has set down only half sentences, and concealed both the
authorities and the reasons he alledges for what he saies, which
is in a strict and proper sense to misrepresent. All that he
answers to that distinction between representing and disputing,
which he allows to be good, is this, That the common people
do not distinguish these matters, but look upon all to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Faith of <hi>Papists;</hi> That is, if they hear any man call the
worship of Images Idolatry, they do as verily think that <hi>Papists</hi>
believe Idolatry lawful (as he saies in his <hi>Character)</hi> as that they
worship Images, <hi>risum teneatis!</hi> and thus much for Representing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next dispute is about the rule of Representing. In
his Introduction to</hi> A Papist Misrepresented, <hi>&amp;c. he appeals to
the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>and</hi> Catechism ad Par<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>chos; <hi>this the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer
likes well,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Doctrines and Practises of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, p. 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>but tells him, 1. That</hi> he shows no authority
he hath to interpret that Rule in his own sense, against the Doctrine
of many others as zealous for their Church as himself, <hi>as he does</hi>
in the Popes Personal Infallibility, and the Deposing Power, <hi>which
he saies,</hi> are no Articles of Faith, <hi>though other zealous</hi> Papists
<hi>say they are, and asks</hi> what authority he has to declare the
sence of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bulla Pii quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti super con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm. Concil. Trid.</note> when the Pope has expresly forbidden
all Prelates to do it, and reserved it to the Apostolical See. 2. <hi>The
Answerer tells him,</hi> That he leaves out, in the several particulars,
an essential part of the character of a Papist since the Council
of <hi>Trent,</hi> which is, that he doth not only believe the Doctrine
there defined, to be true, but to be necessary to Salvation.
3. That he never sets down what it is, which makes any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
to become a Doctrine of their Church. 4. That he makes use
of the Authority of particular Divines, as delivering the sense of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53692:58"/>
their Church, when there are so many of greater Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them: whereas, if we proceed by his own rule, the greater
number is to carry it. <hi>These were all very material objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and did deserve to be considered; but as for the three last,
he takes no notice of them in his Reflections, and says very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to the first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Answerer had asked,</hi> How the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> comes
to be the Rule and Measure of Doctrine to any here <hi>(in</hi> England)
where it was never received? <hi>(p. 4.) To this he answers in his
Reflections, (p. 5.)</hi> That the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> is received here,
and all the Catholick World, as to all its Definitions of Faith.
<hi>But I told him in my Reply,</hi> (p. 51.) <hi>that the meaning of that
Question was not,</hi> Whether it was owned by private Catholicks,
but by what publick Act of Church or State it had been received in
<hi>England,</hi> as it had been in other Catholick Countries; <hi>and this he
says nothing to, and therefore might as well have let it alone at
first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reinforced the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius 4th,</hi> against any private
mans interpreting the Council according to his own private
Sense; shewed the Reason and Policy of it, and what a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
it is for a private man, when their Divines differ in
their Opinions about any Doctrine, to call one Opinion Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
Represented, and the other Popery Misrepresented, as our
Author has done in the Articles of the Popes personal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,
and the Deposing Power, as if <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and
<hi>Suarez</hi> must not pass for good Catholicks, but for Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>representers,
because they do not believe in these Points,
as our Representer does? and this he takes no further no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of.</p>
               <p>But to prove that he has not interpreted the Council accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own private Sense, he appeals to the Bishop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>'s
Exposition,<note place="margin">Reflect. p. 7.</note> which is approved by the Pope himself, and
therefore <hi>has the Authority of the See Apostolick.</hi> To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s Controversies had as great an Attesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> 5. as the Bishop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s from this
present Pope;<note place="margin">Reply, p. 44.</note> to which he gives no Answer; and I observed
from <hi>Canus,</hi> that the Popes private Approbation is not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the See Apostolick, but only his Judgment, <hi>ex Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra;</hi>
and to this he gives no Answer, but Shuffles a little about
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53692:59"/>
                  <hi>a private,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Papists Prot. p. 25</note> 
                  <hi>malicious,</hi> and <hi>inconsiderate</hi> Judgment, which I have
now answered, and makes a new Flourish about the several
Translations, and great approbation which has been given
to this Exposition, which I have again said something to, tho
I need not have said any thing, had I before seen the Preface
to the Answer to the Bishop of <hi>Condom,</hi> and I guess our Author
will never mention it more, and then what becomes of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>
               <p>He denied the <hi>Popes Personal Infallibility to be an Article of Faith
because not positively determined by any General Council.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reflect. p 8.</note> In answer
to which I told him,<note place="margin">Reply, p. 47.</note> that other <hi>Roman</hi> Divines did believe it an
Article of Faith. That the Churches Infallibility was not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by any General Council, no more than the Popes Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,
and yet was owned by them as an Article of Faith;
that if there be any Infallibility in the Church, the Pope as the
Supreme Pastor, has the fairest pretence to it. For Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ought in reason to accompany the greatest and most absolute
Power; and this he has passed over silently.</p>
               <p>Next comes <hi>the Deposing Power,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Refl. p. 8, 9.</note> which has as evidently been
declared in General Councils, as Transubstantiation; and how
comes this to be no Article of Faith? To this he answers,
that it wants an <hi>Anathema,</hi> and that it is not decreed as
a Doctrinal point, but as a matter of Discipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>This I examined at large in my Reply,<note place="margin">Rep. p. 49, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                  </note> and he is much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
at it, that I put him out of his Representing humour
by disputing; but he thought himself bound in Civility to
say something to it, and truly he has been wonderfully
Civil, as appears from what I have already said in Answer to
him.</p>
               <p>The Answerer in his Introduction had proved the Deposing
Doctrine on him, from two sayings of his own, <hi>That the orders
of the supreme Pastor are to be obeyed whether infallible or not,</hi> and
that <hi>Popes have own'd the Deposing Doctrine, and acted according
to it:</hi> and others are bound to obey their Orders, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to act when Popes shall require it,<note place="margin">Refl. p 15, 16</note> according to the
Deposing Doctrine: To this he answers in his Reflections, that
he only made a comparison between Civil and Ecclesiastical
Power, and therefore it is as unjust from hence to infer, That all
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53692:59"/>
the Orders of the Pope must be obey'd, as it would be to say,
that Subjects must obey their Princes in every thing they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
whether it be good or bad: and this I told him in my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,<note place="margin">Reply, p. 55.</note>
                  <hi>I would acknowledg to be a good answer, if he would grant the
Deposing Doctrine to be a sin:</hi> But this I suppose he was unwilling
to do, and therefore we hear no more of this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the next place in his Reflections he finds great fault with
the Answerers way of proceeding, which I reduced to Four
Heads,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 58.</note> 1. That the Answerer in some Points owns the Doctrine
<hi>(which he has Represented</hi> to be the Faith of a <hi>Roman</hi>-Catholick)
to be the established Belief of the Church of <hi>England. This I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not to be true, by a particular Examination of those instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
he gave.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 61.</note> 2. <hi>He charges the Answerer</hi> with appealing from
the definitions of their Councils, and sense of their Church, to some
expressions found in old Mass-Books, Rituals, <hi>&amp;c. This I showed
also, that the Answerer has not done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That he appeals from the Declarations of their Councils, and
sense of their Church, to some external action, as in case of respect
shewn to Images and Saints, upon which from our external adoration
you are willing to conclude us guilty of Idolatry. <hi>Whereas he
thinks we must not</hi> judg of these actions without respect to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the Church who commands them,<note place="margin">P. 63.</note> and of the person who
does them. 4. That he appeals from their Councils and sense of
their Church, to the sentiments of their private Authors. <hi>These
Objections I answered at large in my Reply,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 67.</note> 
                  <hi>but he has returned
not one word to any of them, excepting the third, and how he
has answered that, you have already heard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the new way of answering Books <hi>a la-mode</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi>
but the greatest Wits can do no more than the Cause will bear,
tho a little prudence would teach men to say nothing in such a
Cause as will admit of no better a defence.</p>
