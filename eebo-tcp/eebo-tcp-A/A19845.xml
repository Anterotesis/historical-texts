            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the honorable Aſſembly of the Commons houſe in Parliament.</head>
            <head>The humble Petition of Dame <hi>Grace Darcie</hi> widow, mother, and one of the Committes of the body and lands of <hi>Edward Darcie</hi> Eſquire, his Maieſties Warde.</head>
            <head type="sub">Humbly ſhewing,</head>
            <p>THat whereas his Maieſtie by Indenture vnder the Seale of the Court of Wards, dated xxiij <hi>die Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nij Anno</hi> xvij <hi>Iac. Reg. Angl.</hi> did in expreſſe words grant vnto the Petitioner, and one <hi>George Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi> Eſquire, the other Committee of the ſaid Ward (amongſt other lands) the Mannor of <hi>Sutton,</hi> in <hi>Com. Surr.</hi> and the Advowſon and next preſentation to the Parſonage thereunto belonging.</p>
            <p>Which Parſonage became voide in Auguſt 1621. and the Petitioner (ſo ſoone as ſhe could haue notice thereof) preſented a Clerke thereto, but the Ordinary could not admit him, for that the Church was full, by reaſon of the Lord Keepers preſenting of one Doctor <hi>Graunt</hi> vnto it, one of the Prebends of <hi>Weſtm.</hi> who was Examiner alſo in his Lordſhips houſe, who had cloſely got his Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his Induction alſo in the Church of <hi>Sutton</hi> aforeſaid; ſo the Petitioner was conſtrained to ſend to the Curſitor of <hi>Surrey</hi> for a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> her onely courſe to auoide this vſurpation of the ſaid Doctor; but the Curſitor refuſed to make the ſaid Writ, for that he had a Caueat vnder the Lord Keepers hand to ſtay the ſame.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the Petitioner preferred ſundry petitions to his Lordſhip to recall his direction, and to giue way to the Writ, but he ſtill denied the ſame; only in the time of the laſt Parliament (in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to one of her petitions) he ſeemed willing to be certified by two of his Maieſties learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, whether or no it belonged to her, and the other Committee in this caſe to preſent; which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſhe ſhewed to his Maieſties Attorney and Sollicitor generall, and made choice of them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the matter, and at length (though with great charge) by her Counſell ſo plainly inſtructed them, that they told her they conceiued it to be her right, and had ſignified as much to his Lordſhip, and were perſwaded his Lordſhip would in no wiſe long ſtay the ſaid Writ. But all this proued but to delay the Petitioner, till the diſſolution of the Parliament, and waſting of the ſix moneths, in which time only by the Common law (as his Lordſhip well knew) ſhe had time to preſent; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time was quite ſpent, ſhe ſent againe to the Curſitor for the Writ, who anſwered, he had made it, and offered it to the ſeale, but ſtill his Lordſhip had reiected it.</p>
            <p>And further, ſhe being vnwilling to leaue any meanes vnattempted, whereby to preſerue the Wards right, in February following, in a wet and cold ſeaſon, to her further charge and neglect of her health, alſo iourneyed to <hi>Royſton,</hi> and by humble petition acquainted his Maieſtie with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of her caſe, and wrong done to her by his Lordſhip, who graciouſly accepted the ſame; and being moued therewith, gaue direction for the writing of a letter to his Lordſhip, with the petition incloſed, which was deliuered into his Lordſhips hands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> howbeit hee deferred to anſwer the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as the preſentation is ſo wrongfully wreſted from the Petitioner, and the very gate of Iuſtice (which ought to all, and alwayes be open) ſhut againſt her, by being denied the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall Writ of <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> in ſo iuſt a caſe, which Writ is free to all his Maieſties ſubiects to ſu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> out (haue they right or no right,) and ſeeing ſhe hath done her owne vtmoſt endeuor to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the ſame in due time, but by the might of the Lord Keeper was hindred and oppoſed, and denied all benefit of the Common law, contrary to many the good and ancient lawes of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: ſo that now not only the Petitioner is preiudiced in her preſent preſentation, but the Ward alſo for euer in his Inheritance, for that he claimeth the ſame as by deſcent from his Grandfather, who was a purchaſer of the ſaid Mannor and Parſonage, and no auoidance ſithence happening, neither <hi>Quare Impedit, Aſſize</hi> of <hi>Darrain</hi> preſentment, nor writ of right of Advowſon will at any time hereafter lie.</p>
            <p>Wherefore her moſt humble ſuite to this Honorable Senate is, that their wiſedomes would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorably be pleaſed to take notice of her cauſe, (conſidering it may be the caſe of many the Nobilitie and Gentrie of the Kingdome) and thereupon giue ſuch reliefe, as may be as well for the righting of her in her preſent preſentation, as the Ward in his Inheritance, as alſo make ſuch prouiſion for the generall ill conſequences growing thereby, as ſhall be moſt agreeable to honor, iuſtice, and that high truſt, which the whole Kingdome hath worthily repoſed in them.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing all thoſe that were heretofore of Councell with the Petitioner in this caſe, are now of this Honourable Houſe, ſhe deſireth that Sir <hi>Henry Yeluerton,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Stone</hi> of London, may be aſſigned to be of her Councell herein.</p>
