            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>WIll you hear a <hi>Spanish</hi> Lady, how she woo'd an <hi>English</hi> Man,</l>
               <l>Garments gay as rich as may be, bedekt with jewels had she on;</l>
               <l>Of a comely countenance and grace was she;</l>
               <l>Both by birth and parentage of high degree.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As his prisoner there he kept her, in his hands her life did lye;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Cupid</hi>'s hands did tye them faster by the liking of an eye:</l>
               <l>In his courteous company was all her joy;</l>
               <l>To savour him in any thing she was not coy.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But at last there came commandment for to set all Ladies free,</l>
               <l>With their jewels still adorned, none to do them injury.</l>
               <l>O then said this Lady gay, Full woe is me;</l>
               <l>O let me still sustain this kind captivity.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Gallant Captain, take some pitty on a woman in distress;</l>
               <l>Leave me not within this city, for to dye in heaviness;</l>
               <l>Thou hast set this present day my body free,</l>
               <l>But my heart in prison still remains with thee.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>How shouldst thou, fair Lady, love whom thou know'st thy Country?</l>
               <l>Thy fair words make me suspect thee, serpents lye where flowers grow.</l>
               <l>All the harm I think on thee, most courteous Knight,</l>
               <l>God grant upon my head the same may fully light.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Blessed be the time and season that thou came on <hi>Spanish</hi> ground;</l>
               <l>If you may our foes be termed, gentle foes we have you found:</l>
               <l>With our City you have won our hearts each one,</l>
               <l>Then to your Country bear away that is your own.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Rest you still, most gallant Lady, rest you still and weep no more,</l>
               <l>Of fair flowers you have plenty, <hi>Spain</hi> doth yield you wondrous store.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Spaniards</hi> fraught with jealousie we oft do find,</l>
               <l>But <hi>English</hi> Men throughout the world are counted kind.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Leave me not unto a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> thou alone enjoy'st my heart,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>It would be a shame fair Lady, for to bear a woman hence,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>English</hi> souldiers never carry any such without offence.</l>
               <l>I will quickly change myself, if it be so,</l>
               <l>And like a page will follow thee where e'er thou go.</l>

               <l>I have neither gold nor silver to maintain thee in this case,</l>
               <l>And to travel is great charges, as you know in every place.</l>
               <l>My chains and jewels every one shall be thy own,</l>

               <l>On the seas are many dangers, many storms do there arise,</l>
               <l>Which will be to Ladies dreadful, and force tears from watry eyes.</l>
               <l>Well in worth I shall endure extreamly,</l>
               <l>For I could find in heart to lose my life for thee.</l>
