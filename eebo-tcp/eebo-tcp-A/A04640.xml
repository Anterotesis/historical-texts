            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vnderstand them not yet; I shall finde the way to forgiue you.
Be any thing you will be, at your owne charge. Would I had
deseru'd but halfe so well of it in translation, as that ought
to deserue of you in iudgment, if you haue any. I know you will
pretend (whosoeuer you are) to haue that, and more. But all
pretences are not iust claymes. The commendation of good
things may fall within a many, their approbation but in a
few<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the most commend out of affection, selfe tickling,
an easinesse, or imitation: but men iudge only out of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
That is the trying faculty. And, to those workes that
will beare a Iudge, nothing is more dangerous then a foolish
prayse. You will say I shall not haue yours, therfore; but rather
the contrary, all vexation of Censure. If I were not aboue such
molestations now, I had great cause to thinke vnworthily of my
studies, or they had so of mee. But I leaue you to your exercise.

               <l>Conscript Fathers,</l>
               <l>In great affaires, and doubtfull, it behooues</l>
               <l>Men, that are ask'd their sentence, to be free</l>
               <l>From either hate, or loue, anger, or pitty:</l>
               <l>For, where the least of these doe hinder, there</l>
               <l>The minde not easily discernes the truth.</l>
               <l>I speake this to you, in the name of <hi>Rome,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For whom you stand; and to the present cause:</l>
               <l>That this foule fact of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> and the rest,</l>
               <l>Weigh not more with you, then your dignity;</l>
               <l>And you be more indulgent to your passion,</l>
               <l>Then to your honor. If there could be found</l>
               <l>A paine, or punishment, equall to their crimes,</l>
               <l>I would deuise, and helpe: But if the greatnesse</l>
               <l>Of what they ha' done, exceede all mans inuention,</l>
               <l>I thinke it fit, to stay, where our lawes doe.</l>
               <l>Poore petty States may alter, vpon humor,</l>
               <l>Where, if they' offend with anger, few doe know it,</l>
               <l>Because they are obscure; their Fame, and Fortune</l>
               <l>Is equall, and the same: But they, that are</l>
               <l>Head of the world, and liue in that seene height,</l>
               <l>All Mankinde knowes their actions. So we see</l>
               <l>The greater fortune hath the lesser licence.</l>
               <l>They must nor fauor, hate, and least be angry:</l>
               <l>For what with others is call'd anger, there,</l>
               <l>Is cruelty, and pride. I know <hi>Syllanus,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>VVho spoke before me, a iust, valiant Man,</l>
               <l>A louer of the State, and one that would not,</l>
               <l>In such a businesse, vse or grace, or hatred;</l>
               <l>I know, too, well his manners, and his modesty:</l>
               <l>Nor doe I thinke his sentence cruell (for</l>
               <l>'Gainst such delinquents, what can be too bloody?)</l>
               <l>But that it is abhorring from our state;</l>
               <l>Since to a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> offending,</l>
               <l>Our Lawes giue exile, and not death. Why then</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8304:53"/>Decrees he that? 'Twere vaine to thinke, for feare;</l>
               <l>When, by the diligence of so worthy a Consul,</l>
               <l>All is made safe, and certaine. Is't for punishment?</l>
               <l>Why Death's the end of euils, and a rest,</l>
               <l>Rather then torment: It dissolues all griefes.</l>
               <l>And beyond that, is neither care, nor ioy.</l>

               <l>I iudge 'hem, first, to haue their states confiscate,</l>
