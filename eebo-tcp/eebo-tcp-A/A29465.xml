         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may be, upon the first View of the
Title of this short Relation, thou
wilt throw it down with all the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness
imaginable, supposing it to be
but an idle and impertinent Fiction,
such as some Frontless persons have too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
exposed to publick View, on purpose
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46049:3"/>
to impose upon the Credulity of the Gazing
Multitude, who are apt to gape at Wonders,
and to think all true as the Gospel, they see in
Print.</p>
            <p>That this may court thy more favourable
Thoughts, call to minde, that such as intend
to deceive, tell of Wonders that are remote,
and too far distant from thee, either suddenly
to disprove, or presently to confirm thy self in
the belief of what they have told.</p>
            <p>This gives thee an Account of what thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
with little trouble, and as small expence,
behold: Take but a Walk to the <hi>Swan</hi> in the
<hi>Strand,</hi> near <hi>Charing-Cross,</hi> and there thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
satisfie thy Curiosity, and be able to tell the
World whether this following Narration be truth
or invention.</p>
            <p>There thou mayest see a Woman hath Horns
growing upon the hinder part of her Head, an
Object not onely worthy of your Sight, but Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
too! She is Seventy six Years of Age,
Bred and Born in the Parish of <hi>Shotwick</hi> in
<hi>Cheshire,</hi> and within four Miles of <hi>Chester,</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
unto His Blessed Majesty, upon a Farm of
Sixteen pounds <hi>per Annum;</hi> so that she is not
necessitated to this Course of Life: or to deceive
the credulous and short-sighted People, but to
manifest to the World such a Wonder in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46049:3"/>
as hath neither been read or heard of (we
may justly suppose) since the Creation.</p>
            <p>She was Wife to one Master <hi>Henry Davies,</hi> who
dyed Thirty five Years pass'd; And since she hath
lived a Religious Widow, all along of a spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and unblameable Life and Conversation, of
singular use to her Neighbours, for she is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
Mid-wife; happy and successful in that
Undertaking: So that her Departure was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
lamented in the place of her Abode, in
such a measure, that several of her Neighbours
and Acquaintance brought her many Miles of
her Journey.</p>
            <p>This strange and stupendious Effect began first
from a Soreness in that place where now the
Horns grow, which (as 'tis thought) was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
by wearing a straight Hat. This Sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
continued Twenty Years, in which time it
miserably afflicted this good Woman, and ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
gradually unto a Wenn near the bigness of
a large Hen Egg, which continued for the space
of Five Years, more sadly tormenting her than
before: After which time it was, by a strange
operation of Nature, changed into Horns, which
are in shew and substance much like a Ramms
Horns, solid and wrinckled, but sadly grieving
the Old Woman, especially upon the change of
Weather.</p>
            <p>But more accurately to Describe its Nature
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46049:4"/>
and Manner of Production, may be a Subject
proper for a Colledge of Physitians; and no
question but it will be esteemed worthy to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the <hi>Ingenious Vertuoso's</hi> of the Age, who
need not their Glasses to magnifie its Wonder.</p>
            <p>She hath cast her Horns three times already;
The first time was but a single Horn, which
grew long, but as slender as an Oaten straw:
The second was thicker than the former: The
two first Mr. <hi>Hewson</hi> Minister of <hi>Shotwick</hi> (to
whose Wife this Rarity was first discovered) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
of the Old Woman his Parishioner: They
kept not an equal distance of time in falling off,
some at three, some at four, and another at
four Years and a halfs Growth.</p>
            <p>The third time grew two Horns, both which
were beat off by a Fall backward; one of them
an English Lord obtained, and (as is reported)
presented it to the <hi>French</hi> King for the greatest
Rarity in Nature, and received with no less Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration:
The other (which was the largest)
was Nine Inches long, and two Inches about;
it is much valued for the Novelty, a greater than
any <hi>Iohn Tradeskin</hi> can set to view, or the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Traveller can with truth affirm to have seen.
Sir <hi>Willoughby Aston</hi> hath also another Horne
which dropt from this Womans Head, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
it as a Choice Rarity. At this present she
hath a pair of Hornes upon her Head of Six
Moneths Growth; And 'tis not without reason
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46049:4"/>
believed, they will in a short time bee larger
than any of the former; for still the latter have
exceeded the former in bigness.</p>
            <p>The Circumstance of this Relation considered
or examined, at least with the sight of her, I
hope it will not readily be believed to be an
Imposture, or Artificial Projecting; For so grosly
to impose upon His Majesty, and all His Loyal
Subjects, would be an unpardonable Crime, and
would deserve mens Contempt, and not their
Company, and certainly expose the Party to the
Violence of a rude Multitude, who discovering
a Cheat, would, I believe, soon make the Old
Woman pull in her Horns.</p>
